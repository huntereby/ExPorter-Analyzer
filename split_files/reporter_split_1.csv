Forced displacement is on the rise, particularly in areas with high HIV prevalence. Disruption
of social networks following forced displacement can amplify the risks of substance use
disorders (SUDs) and enable HIV transmission. HIV transmission within and between forcibly
displaced and local communities in situations of forced displacement can be facilitated by
delayed HIV diagnosis and less viral suppression due to financial, logistical and administrative
barriers in access to HIV care encountered by displaced people. Forcibly displaced men who
have sex with men (fdMSM) can experience additional barriers due to stigmatization of their
sexual orientation (MSM stigma), particularly in countries with high prevalence of MSM stigma
such as Ukraine. Since Ukraine has one of the largest HIV epidemics in Europe and is
experiencing a war that resulted in internal displacement of an estimated 5.9 million
Ukrainians, fdMSM in Ukraine face unique challenges with respect to access to HIV care.
We propose a study of 1,200 MSM (600 local and 600 fdMSM) in Ukraine: 800 MSM (400
local and 400 fdMSM) in Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, and 400 (200 local and 200 fdMSM) in
Lviv, a city in Western Ukraine; both cities are hosting large numbers of internally displaced
people. Modified respondent-driven sampling will be used to recruit participants and collect
social network and behavioral data. Blood samples will be collected from participants living
with HIV for viral load testing, HIV genetic sequencing and subsequent phylogenetic analysis.
All MSM living with HIV will be invited for follow-up interviews after 6- and 12-months postbaseline
recruitment.
Our overarching hypothesis is that fdMSM will have higher prevalence of SUDs, HIV, risk-related
sexual behaviors, and be more likely to appear in recent HIV transmission clusters
compared to local MSM, and that fdMSM in Lviv will have more stigmatizing social network
ties that originated after displacement compared to fdMSM in Kyiv. We will address the
following Specific Aims: 1) Determine the prevalence of HIV, SUDs, risk-related sexual
behaviors, MSM stigma, and HIV testing among local and fdMSM in Kyiv and Lviv, Ukraine;
2) Characterize changes in social network composition since February 2022 and the impact
of these changes on SUDs, MSM stigma, HIV risk behaviors, HIV testing, and viral
suppression (among MSM living with HIV) in both local and fdMSM; 3) Estimate the impact of
MSM stigma and social support disruption on HIV transmission dynamics between and within
local MSM and fdMSM using phylodynamic analysis."

The purpose of this contract is to conduct work required and to provide the appropriate deliverables associated with the development toward a clinical prototype of the Nestorone/Estradiol (Nes/E2) vaginal rings.  This work will be conducted by NICHD in collaboration with the Population Council (PC).  PC holds the Investigational New Drug (IND) application with FDA for the rings.
In the first phase of the ring development, the Government was supposed received a detailed analysis regarding the feasibility of manufacturing the vaginal rings. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, a report could not be delivered.  Consequently, PC has initiated a search for a new vendor to provide this analysis, which will contain a thorough plan describing the cost and timeline of the work related to the optimization and Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) manufacturing of the vaginal rings. These activities will be incorporated in this task order."
10874493,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):
Learning is a fundamental component of neural systems. It is essential for gaining new knowledge or skills, 
and impaired learning faculties can have major deleterious effects. Although various forms of associative 
and perceptual learning have been studied our current understanding of how neural circuits learn remains 
incomplete. Humans and animals leverage category learning––grouping stimuli together based on shared 
and often higher order features––to deal with the world’s dazzling complexity. Yet, the neural mechanisms 
underlying category learning are not known. In this proposal, we focus on auditory category learning 
leveraging the rich nature and dynamic structure of natural and synthetic soundscapes. Auditory category 
learning is ubiquitous across the animal kingdom, with vivid examples from invertebrates to humans, and is 
intimately related to the transformation of sound to percepts. However, mechanistic studies of category 
learning in audition are not yet mature. In mice, where powerful experimental toolkits exist and new tools 
are continuously developed, studies of auditory category learning are scarce. Here we will study the multi-regional basis of reshaping of population activity following learning. We will analyze a unique dataset of 
simultaneous population recordings across brain areas in mice learning an auditory categorization task. We 
will apply novel computational methods to study how cortical auditory circuits process sounds and how this 
processing changes following learning. We will explore multiple types of trained categorization as well as 
responses to categories of natural sounds. We will characterize changes both at the level of single neurons 
and at the level of neuronal populations. Through simultaneous recordings across brain areas we will 
delineate changes both at the level of individual brain areas and at the level of interactions between brain 
areas. Finally, we will use perturbations to improve our causal understanding of the circuitry. These 
experiments and analyses will allow us to explore specific hypotheses regarding the plasticity and circuit 
computations of cortical circuits in the mammalian brain, and how these support category learning."
10874485,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):
Multimodal integration is a fundamental feature of animal nervous systems that allows them to extract 
useful information from complex environmental signals and guide behavior. A defect in this process may 
lead to communication disorders. However, there is currently limited understanding of this pervasive 
phenomenon. Due to its simplicity, the honeybee antennal lobe (AL) provides an excellent system for 
studying sensory integration. Chemical (i.e., odor) and mechanical (i.e., wind speed) information converge
within the AL, likely in service of two intermingled tasks facing honeybees - tracking highly turbulent odor 
plumes and discriminating odors. Both are critical for foraging success. This proposal seeks to: (1) 
determine the impact of mechanical input (wind speed) on AL odor responses and odor classification; (2) 
determine the functional roles and mechanisms of multisensory integration within the AL. We postulate that 
the AL can switch between two distinct dynamic regimes – an odor tracking regime (triggered by high 
mechanical input) and an odor discrimination regime (triggered by low mechanical input). In other words, 
input from one modality affects the coding scheme of the other. To test this hypothesis, our experimental 
work will entail a suite of electrophysiological experiments that disentangle the contributions of each 
modality to AL dynamics, determine the impact of mechanical input on correlations across the AL, and 
assess the dependence of AL odor classification on mechanical input. Computationally, we will construct a 
realistic, experimentally benchmarked spiking network model of the AL integrating mechanical and olfactory 
inputs, and use it to study the network mechanisms that underlie AL dynamics within the two postulated 
regimes. The model will be used to explore conceptual ideas and generate specific hypotheses that will be 
tested in subsequent experiments. Finally, we will incorporate the fundamental principles uncovered in our 
work into novel machine learning algorithms for solving multimodal problems. The PIs are excellently suited 
for the proposed work – Dr. Lei is an expert in olfaction and the electrophysiological studies of the AL, Dr. 
Patel has extensive experience in biologically realistic modeling of AL dynamics, and Dr. Bazhenov is an 
expert in computational neuroscience, data analysis and machine learning."
10910919,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): 
The incidence of tick-borne diseases (TbD) is increasing, with ~500k reported cases during 2004-2016 
from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and 
is expected to increase due to global climate change. Some of the most common TbD in the U.S. include 
anaplasmosis, babesiosis, and Lyme disease transmitted by the same tick vector, I. scapularis. Lyme 
disease is especially pernicious because it is difficult to diagnose early, often misdiagnosed, and is difficult 
to treat. Because current diagnostic methods are insufficiently sensitive or non-existent, we propose a 
novel approach for diagnosis via a microfluidic platform with an integrated multimodal sensing system and 
machine learning (ML) algorithm. Based on our preliminary and published data, we hypothesize that we 
can detect TbD and their coinfections from whole blood. Central to our vision is a system designed for 
minimal user intervention to detect and measure complex cell data using ML. The diagnosis of TbD will be 
achieved through three objectives: 1) design a dielectrophoresis (DEP) based platform for detecting TbDs 
from whole blood; 2) design 3D sensors and a readout integrated circuit (ROIG) for sensitive in-vitro 
detection of cells; and 3) develop an ML algorithm to diagnose early-stage Lyme disease, babesiosis, and 
anaplasmosis. An extremely sensitive (<0.1aF), low-voltage (1.8V for core & 3.3V for 10), low-power 
(<10mW), multi-channel (~16-ch), high-speed (~5MSample/sec per channel) readout integrated circuit 
(ROIG) will be integrated to detect single-cell behavior at high resolution (~10-bit resolution). The novel ML 
algorithm(s) will use cell data to determine the type of infection intelligently, reducing >96Gbit data during 
each diagnostic cycle (~2min) into as simple as 1-byte diagnostic information (i.e., 1: positive, 0: negative) 
per tested population of the cells or disease. Further, an open-source program to diagnose TbD will be 
created and made available freely from a public software repository. This developed diagnostic technology 
will simultaneously meet high-sensitivity, low-power/voltage, high-purity, and high-viability performance 
metrics by cutting the diagnosis time from 4-6 weeks (late stages) to <30 min (early stages). The proposed 
research will lead to faster diagnosis, reducing the hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality associated with 
TbD and their coinfections."
10899736,"The proposed research is relevant to public health and well aligned with the mission of NIAMS because it
 addresses the substantial need to improve effectiveness in prevention of ankle sprains, one of the most
 common musculoskeletal injuries that can significantly impact physical activity and quality of life. While
 external passive supports, such as ankle taping and bracing, are the most widely used approaches to
 prevent ankle sprains, their long-term use makes patients overly reliant on the passive and constant
 support, which leads to ankle muscle and soft tissue atrophy. Furthermore, this approach not only restricts
 inversion-eversion motion but also dorsiflexion-plantarflexion motion, which in turn may alter natural
 lower-extremity biomechanics. This project seeks to study a unique smart shoe system, using integrated
 scientific solutions of engineering, computing and behavioral science, to overcome these limitations and
 provide enhanced support for individuals at risk of ankle injury. Our specific aims are: (1) to design and
 implement a smart shoe system that integrates robust, real-time estimation of biomechanical data and
 activity recognition from wearable sensors with soft actuators capable of actively adjusting the stiffness of
 the ankle brace; (2) to quantify and model ankle stiffness and foot loading trajectory in healthy individuals
 as well as in people at risk of ankle sprains; (3) to integrate an injury prediction algorithm and a
 closed-loop feedback controller that provides active ankle support to prevent sprains; and (4) to refine the
 developed algorithms for free-living use and design an intuitive mobile user interface that provides
 summative injury risk metrics in real-time. We will validate and evaluate the proposed smart shoe system
 by closely engaging with clinical partners to ensure the system is tailored toward optimal clinical
 integration in mind. The smart shoe system is clinically significant because it will allow clinicians to better
 understand foot-ankle mechanics and their correlation to ankle injury risk during various physical activities
 and help them provide effective and summative feedback to the users in a timely manner to promote their
 adherence to ankle injury prevention strategies. Successful development of the system and rigorous
 assessment of its patient- and clinic-centered perceived utility will lay the groundwork for follow-up clinical
 trials specifically aimed at investigating the long-term effect of interventions on preserving/promoting ankle
 health and enhancing behavioral adherence to clinical recommendations."
11191359,"Oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), ranking as the sixth most prevalent cancer globally, is especially prevalent in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The high mortality rate in these regions is largely due to late diagnosis and delayed treatment, leading to advanced disease at the time of discovery. Building on the achievements of two NIH UH projects and a Phase I SBIR project, Light Research Inc (LRI) aims to develop and bring to market an innovative mobile oral-cancer screening and treatment (MOST) system, tailored for low-resource settings (LRS). This system integrates dual-modal oral cancer screening technology with photochemistry-based, FDA-approved photodynamic therapy (PDT). The project involves three aims: optimizing the MOST system for human studies (Aim 1), establishing the system for image-guided PDT using animal models (Aim 2), and evaluating the system for imaging and treating highrisk oral premalignant lesions (OPML) and early-stage oral cancer (Aim 3). The significance of this project lies in its potential to facilitate early detection and prompt treatment of oral cancers, thereby mitigating disease progression, reducing morbidity and mortality, and lowering healthcare costs. It specifically targets the critical challenge of screening high-risk populations and treating patients with high-risk OPML and early-stage oral cancer in LRS."
11199178,"Lags, delays, and failures in clinical trial recruitment and enrollment hampers the rate of drug development and medical progress. The work proposed in this contract submission addresses clinic-facing challenges in clinical trial recruitment. The overall goal of the contract is to build, test, and deploy at the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University and it’s community affiliated sites a software tool, OnTrial, that improves provider awareness of patients potentially eligible for trials, clinical trial patient eligibility evaluation workflows, team communication of trial recruitment activities, and tracking of recruitment efforts. OnTrial’s innovation is the scalable, secure, and systematic review of patient medical records which are parsed for trial matching metrics using the same approach and data model for trial criteria parsing. The 1-to-1 structuring of patient and trial data is the fulcrum upon which the innovation rests. In this contract effort, OnTrial will include breast, thoracic, head and neck, lung, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary patients and trials. All patients being seen by participating providers will be systematically considered for trial eligibility without bias. It is expected that OnTrial will significantly improve trial recruitment overall as well as the diversity of trial participants.

10876936,"Acute pain is important to survival, however, if the pain system becomes hypersensitive to non-painful and
painful stimuli this can result in conditions called allodynia and hyperalgesia, respectively, and with time,
chronic pain. Chronic pain is a significant burden on society, with an estimated prevalence of 11.2% in the
U.S., and is a significant contributor to the opioid epidemic. Neuromodulation, via electrical stimulation of
nerve fibers, has shown promise as an alternative pain treatment to pharmaceuticals with less side effects.
but is still limited in efficacy for many patients. The programming (selective delivery of pulse width, frequency,
and amplitude) of the stimulation is often performed by trial-and-error, and is kept constant (i.e., is open loop)
between programming sessions. Closed-loop (CL) stimulation, in contrast, adapts over time to the system
needs by automatically adjusting the parameters in response to a measured pain signal in the body. CL
approaches in engineering systems are often designed based on models that mathematically characterize
how a system responds to an actuation signal. Current CL approaches for pain, however, are model-free and
simply wait for measured pain activity in the spinal cord to cross a threshold before activating suppressive
stimulation. This acts as a local anesthetic, suppressing pathological pain, but unfortunately it also
suppresses acute pain that alerts the body to damaging stimuli. In the proposed program, we will address
these limitations by building a computational framework for a novel adaptive, model-based closed-loop
peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) approach for the correction of the dysfunctional pain system back to a
normal physiological state. This will be accomplished by designing “model-matching” feedback PNS
strategies, which match the response to exogenous stimuli (e.g. paw rub) of the CL pain system in a nerveinjured animal to that of a naïve, healthy animal. In order to match responses, we propose to build
pseudolinear time invariant (pLTI) models of the response to stimulation in healthy and nerve injured
conditions by collecting data and performing system identification. We will then optimize controllers to
minimize the error between the responses. These controllers will be designed and optimized in silico then
tested in vivo by continuously recording the electrophysiological response and responding by changing the
amplitude and polarity of PNS pulses held at a constant frequency. This framework will be developed and
tested using novel electrophysiological recordings from wide dynamic range (WDR) neurons in the dorsal
horn of the spinal cord in naïve and nerve-injured rats in response to PNS and stimuli (e.g. stroke of a paw).
WDR neurons are a cell type selected for its well documented deviation from its baseline in pain syndromes
and role as a relay station between pain receptors in the periphery and the thalamus in the brain. The
thalamus is the gateway for pain information to enter the brain for perception and can be accessed and
recorded from using deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes in humans, making it an ideal location for pain
therapies designed for translation in the future. Thus, we will simultaneously record from WDR neurons and
pain sensitive populations of neurons in the thalamus."
11199161,"TheMednet, an interactive Q&A and social decision support platform, is currently the largest and most active online community for oncologists in the United States, reaching over 85% of US oncologists. The forum serves as a centralized knowledge resource that can be accessed by physicians anywhere in the US at no cost. For this Phase II project, theMednet proposes to further develop its solution to the critical problem of clinical trial enrollment by improving physician awareness of clinical trials by developing technology that generates clinical trial recommendations based on a physician’s site activity, user profile, location, and past patient history. Our goal is to target messaging and social content about clinical trials to oncologists at the point of care so that they are aware of and encourage eligible patients to enroll. theMednet also aims to increase diversity of patient enrollment with the development predictive tools that enable targeted messaging towards physicians likely to serve those historically underrepresented in clinical trials. To test the approach, theMednet will implement a randomized controlled trial in collaboration with SWOG, a National Cancer Institute clinical trial collaborative group, to evaluate whether theMednet will improve accrual to clinical trials."

10782453,"PROJECT SUMMARY
As a critical component of our long-term strategy to develop the next generation of leaders in clinical and
translational research (CTR), we propose to employ the mentored Career Development Program (KL2) to
support full-time post-doctoral, mentored career development as we expand from a “small” to a “medium-sized”
hub. In the prior two cycles, we supported career development of an extraordinary group of young clinical and
translational scientists, all of whom continue to be engaged in CTR. In the next iteration, our first aim is to
continue to provide customized mentoring and didactic content to advance clinical and translational research in
our trainee cohort. Our second aim is to challenge KL2 scholars to identify gaps and opportunities relevant to
advancing CTR in their fields. We anticipate that providing conceptual and practical tools of improvement science
during this early developmental period will have enduring effects on the vision and goals of KL2 graduates. We
are confident this strategy will increase the likelihood that our trainees become active agents of transformational
change in CTR as they proceed along their career paths. Our third aim is to encourage KL2 scholars to situate
their specific research within the full CTR spectrum (T1 to T4) and establish multidisciplinary CTR networks. To
enhance networking and team science skills, our KL2 scholars will work in teams to identify nearby scientists
and research groups working in each of the CTR stages relevant to their focus. This process will culminate in a
capstone effort resulting in a new biennial, multidisciplinary T1–T4 CTR symposium sponsored by the CTSI with
invitations to nearby CTSA sites and related institutions. In summary, KL2 scholars will successfully complete
training on the responsible conduct of research, general and targeted formal didactics addressing proficiency in
CTR, Master’s-level training in multidisciplinary CTR programs, specialized/advanced course work, training in
team science, individualized and didactic training in grant preparation, exposure to alternative career
opportunities, distance and exchange training, and mentored performance of an innovative high-impact
translational research project. Target expectations include first-author publication of ≥3 manuscripts and
submission of a K-level grant or equivalent. We will recruit sequential cohorts of four scholars each, all with
doctoral degrees (MD, PhD, DDS, PsyD, etc.) and extensive prior research training (≥2 years post-doctorate)
plus two investigators meeting identical criteria supported by institutional funds, for 2-year training cycles.
Scholars will dedicate ≥75% effort to career development activities supported by KL2 directors with extensive
and exemplary mentoring experience. Additional support will include a strongly invested KL2 Executive
Committee, a newly constituted Diversity Advisory Committee, and a broad and diverse program faculty who will
serve on scholar-specific mentoring committees. During the past two cycles, the KL2 program successfully met
the need of early stage CTR investigators; the academic leaders will ensure continued excellence."
10839316,"Studies from our PPG have elucidated fundamental roles for PD-1/PD-L1 and TIGIT/CD155 in regulating
immune tolerance in cancer and autoimmunity. Our investigations in experimental models and in humans
suggest there are distinct effects of PD-1/PD-L1 and TIGIT/CD155 signaling in human Tregs with PD-1:PD-L1
interactions regulating T cell tolerance while TIGIT exhibits T cell intrinsic inhibitory effects that regulates
tolerance and Treg function. Based on single-cell transcriptomic and TCR sequence analyses of tumor samples
from brain tissue of patients with glioblastoma receiving αPD-1 or combinations αPD-1/αTIGIT mAb, we
observed that while PD-1 blockade alone induced Treg proliferation, the combination of PD-1 & TIGIT blockade
resulted in IFNγ-secreting Treg effectors which resemble dysfunctional Tregs in autoimmunity. Data from
Projects 1 & 2 showed that PD-1 blockade increases the frequency of TIGIT+ Tregs and when coupled with
TIGIT agonism, controlled pathogenic T cells ameliorating autoimmunity induced by PD-1 blockade.
Furthermore, combination PD-1 & TIGIT blockade increases pro-inflammatory signatures in PD-L1+ and CD155+
myeloid cells without impairing the efficacy of PD-1 blockade in controlling tumors. These data suggest that
TIGIT is a potential target for treating immune-related adverse events associated with PD-1 blockade. Our
underlying hypothesis is that signaling through PD-1/PD-L1 and TIGIT/CD155 are distinct but
synergistically coordinate Treg and myeloid cell function in a bidirectional fashion in autoimmunity and
cancer. Thus, the goal of this project is to identify key pathways induced by PD-1/TIGIT signaling in human
Tregs and PD-L1/CD155 signaling in human myeloid cells. To achieve these goals, we propose in aim 1 to
determine how the balance of PD-1+ and TIGIT+ signaling in human Tregs modulates peripheral tolerance in
health and disease states by elucidating key transcriptional pathways induced by PD-1 and/or TIGIT signaling
and blockade in dysfunctional MS Tregs compared with healthy Tregs. Using brain tissue from glioblastoma
patients in our clinical trial, we will identify the in vivo effects of PD-1 and/or TIGIT blockade on Treg phenotypes
and clonal expansion using single-cell sequencing and spatial multi-omic technologies. In aim 2, we will
determine how PD-L1+ and CD155+ signaling governs transcriptional signatures in myeloid cells by examining
how alterations in PD-L1/CD155 signaling modulates myeloid cell function in MS patients in vitro. Finally, we will
identify key transcriptional signatures induced in vivo by PD-L1+ and CD155+ agonist in glioblastoma generating
immune-brain cell interactomes based on transcriptional signatures, which will be confirmed using spatial multi-
omics. Findings from our study will guide the development of combination immune checkpoint therapies in
autoimmunity and cancer and potentially provide a means to effectively administer these therapies while
preventing complications of autoimmunity."

In this Phase I project, we will show how to apply the popular HoloViz suite of Python open-source data analysis and visualization tools to the specific visualizations and workflows typical in various types of cancer research, applying their unique strengths in big-data rendering, browser-based interactivity, and support for either notebook or website interfaces to both typical and extreme example workflows and situations in cancer research. The work will be released as fully open-source tutorials and libraries, ready for the research community to apply to their problems, along with prototype integrations into the Cancer Research Data Commons. This work will form the foundation for Phase II efforts focusing on specific performance limitations, gaps in functionality, and improvements to make these tools even more powerful for cancer research."
11191716,"One of the major factors limiting pre-clinical and clinical use of FLASH RT is the difficulty in measuring FLASH irradiation beam parameters such as dose, dose per pulse, pulse repetition frequencies, and time structure with the available conventional radiation detectors, electrometers, and dosimetry protocols. In Phase I, we designed and constructed a novel NIST-traceable ionization chamber prototype for FLASH dosimetry. We also developed a prototype electrometer that can provide time-resolved data. For Phase II, we will finalize construction methods and materials of the ionization chamber, and we will further enhance the electrometer to achieve higher frequency monitoring of the measured signal, improve impulse response of the electrometer, and prepare for commercialization. In addition, we will fully characterize the final dosimetry system in FLASH beamlines to prepare for commercial release. Although we plan to verify performance in both proton and electron FLASH beams, the ultimate test of an ion chamber and electrometer developed for absolute dosimetry in FLASH beams will be in electron FLASH beamlines because these have the highest instantaneous dose rates and dose per pulse of the available modalities. This dosimetry system is urgently needed to bring FLASH RT dosimetry up to the standard required for clinical RT."

The objective of this proposal is to address the computational challenges in integrative analysis of imaging and multi-omics data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), and The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) via an innovative AI-powered, scalable, and cloud-based data analytics platform to fully unlock the potential of the Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC). This will be accomplished by building a computational framework that integrates novel data analysis algorithms including deep learning into a cloud-based platform for revealing complex relationships between medical images, multi-omics, and phenotypic outcomes. This project not only facilitates the development of new data analysis techniques, but also addresses emerging scientific questions in cancer research via a cloud-based data analytics pipeline that consists of innovative modules interfaced with CRDC. The proposed computational methods and pipeline are expected to impact cancer research and enable investigators to effectively test their scientific hypothesis."

evaluate retinal structure and function over time and in response to therapies. Currently there is a
proliferation of technology to provide data and this data comes from many instruments and from different
companies. It is increasingly difficult for any one person or reading center to evaluate this information.

10907002,"PROJECT SUMMARY 
Neural crest progenitors are essential for development of peripheral ganglia in the autonomic nervous system. Much is known about processes that control differentiation of neural crest progenitors for many autonomic ganglia. However, very little is known about formation of cell lineages within pelvic ganglia. Regulatory processes that control neurogenesis, differentiation, diversification, and maturation of pelvic autonomic neurons are undefined. Pelvic ganglia play essential roles in initiating bladder contraction and mediating efficient emptying. Thus, studies of pelvic neurons will inform understanding of urinary tract conditions that affect a large portion of the population. In humans, pelvic autonomic neurons are scattered primarily in the inferior hypogastric plexus, while in rodents pelvic neurons are aggregated into major pelvic ganglion situated alongside the lower urinary tract (LUT). Our prior LUT studies in mice identified expression of the transcription factor Pax3 in fetal and postnatal pelvic ganglia when pelvic autonomic neurons are differentiating and maturing. Because Pax3 is widely expressed during development, mutations in this gene are typically lethal due to neural tube defects. We generated novel lines of mice that have loss of Pax3 in neural crest lineages. These animals are postnatal viable and exhibit deficits of bladder wall innervation with altered voiding patterns. Neural-crest restricted Pax3 mutants offer an exciting opportunity to identify key regulatory aspects of pelvic ganglia formation and determine how deficits of pelvic autonomic neurons relate to LUT dysfunction. In this study we focus on postnatal stages of pelvic ganglia maturation to test the following hypotheses: 1 – Pax3 is essential for producing the normal allocation of neuron types as the mouse major pelvic ganglion matures postnatally. 2 – neural crest-specific loss of Pax3 reduces total numbers of pelvic autonomic neurons at maturity. Use of single-cell sequencing and high-resolution large-scale microscopy will be applied to assess the final composition of pelvic ganglia in postnatal Pax3 mutants compared to normal littermates. Research outcomes will provide greater understanding of how alterations in pelvic innervation contribute to LUT dysfunction."

Functional status is defined by the ability to perform daily physical tasks necessary for independent living and
is essential among persons with chronic kidney disease (CKD) for disease self-management, eligibility for kid-ney transplantation, and for ensuring good quality of life. People with CKD at all stages are at increased risk of
poor physical functioning that occurs earlier than in the general population. Due to the high prevalence of phys-ical impairments among persons with CKD, the National Kidney Foundation clinical practice guidelines recom-mend regular assessments to identify those with physical limitations with the goal of improving outcomes. De-spite this acknowledgement of the importance of physical function to the health of persons with CKD, there has
been limited research in the setting of CKD that would allow evidence-based clinical monitoring. To date, stud-ies in kidney disease populations have been limited by examining physical function at one time point, by evalu-ating relationships only with mortality, and by focusing largely on persons with kidney failure with replacement
therapy (KFRT) and older adults. Early detection and intervention to prevent physical limitations and disability
may be most effective if implemented during earlier stages of CKD and among younger adults. Risk factors of
physical function decline have also been inadequately evaluated in persons with CKD and recommended
physical function assessments are not routinely performed in CKD care. We propose to use nearly 20 years of
follow up data from the NIDDK-sponsored Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study that represents
diverse populations across the spectrum of CKD stages to enhance our understanding of the prognostic im-portance of physical function over time among persons with CKD, including insights to risk factors of physical
function decline, and to build a clinical monitoring tool of physical function. We will characterize the trajectories
of physical function along with their associated factors among people with CKD to increase the understanding
of the pathways that lead to physical function decline and to identify modifiable factors for intervention develop-ment (Aim 1). We will determine the relationship of longitudinal physical function with onset of KFRT, hospitali-zations, and death (Aim 2). Lastly, we develop a monitoring tool for physical function that could guide treatment
and prognostic decisions in CKD clinical practice. We will also test this tool in an external cohort with advanced
CKD (Aim 3). Ultimately, the proposed study will increase our understanding of physical function in CKD, in-cluding insights into risk factors for decline, and its relationship to important outcomes; and the work will culmi-nate in a parsimonious set of physical function measures that can be used for clinical monitoring of physical
health to inform treatment and prognostic decisions. This information could change how CKD patients are
monitored in clinical care, guide patient-centered treatments, and promote broad improvement in physical func-tion for this high-risk population by catalyzing greater awareness and targeted interventions."

The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) requires support for logistical and operational coordination, website and communication management, analytic and data management, infrastructure for emerging research, regulatory, and monitoring of research activities for the Prevention and Treatment through a Comprehensive Care Continuum for HIV-affected Adolescents in Resource Constrained Settings Implementation Science Network (PATC3H-IN) (UG1/UM2) Program.
The NICHD and partner NIH Institutes anticipate funding 8 PATC3H-IN UG1 awards in Asia and throughout sub-Saharan Africa in 2023 through a cooperative agreement mechanism for interventions of high public health significance: The prevention of new HIV infections among adolescents at risk, and the identification of, linkage to and retention in care of, and long-term viral suppression among youth living with HIV in low-to-middle income countries with high HIV burden. The PATC3H-IN network will expand and/or improve on successes achieved by its predecessor, PATC3H, to new geographic settings and/or risk populations and stimulate much needed implementation science (IS) research in the prevention of new HIV infections among adolescents at risk and the identification of, and linkage and retention to care of and long-term viral suppression among youth living with HIV in low-to-middle income countries (LMICs). PATC3H-IN will establish a network of investigators with multidisciplinary expertise on the youth-specific PHCC and in IS research, whose mission will be to evaluate promising prevention innovations contextually and developmentally tailored for HIV uninfected at-risk youth, and treatment and care interventions for youth living with HIV which have demonstrated efficacy and/or effectiveness in adolescent or adult populations and to translate them into public health practices. 
The structure of PATC3H-IN will consist of multiple interdependent functional components: (1) Five Clinical Research Centers (CRC) awarded through the UG1 grant mechanism; (2) one Implementation Science Coordinating Center (ISCC) to be awarded through a UM2 grant mechanism in 2024; and (3) a Scientific Leadership Committee (SLC). The CRCs will conduct clinical research and clinical trials, including implementation, effectiveness, and hybrid implementation-effectiveness studies at their 8-or more participating Clinical Research Performance Sites (CRPS). The ISCC will establish infrastructure to support research education and capacity building across PATC3H-IN, as well as infrastructure for stakeholder engagement in and dissemination of findings from PATC3H-IN and advanced statistical modeling support across PATC3H-IN. The ISCC will also provide infrastructure for conducting foundational research to support the work of clinical sites, including possible modeling studies and translation projects, as well as national surveys, and/or systematic collection and analysis of relevant policies and laws. Lastly, the SLC will be responsible for PATC3H-IN governance, oversight, and coordination, and will develop and implement the network research agenda, convening working groups as needed, prioritizing emerging research projects, efficiently managing the development of clinical protocols, implementing and completing clinical trials, and ensuring timely publication and communication of results."

10906274,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):
One hallmark of complex multicellular life is the ability of stem cells to asymmetrically differentiate into
multiple cell types - i.e. the ability for a stem cell to give birth to a new cell type while retaining its own.
The regulation of asymmetric cell division is important for organismal development and processes such as
tissue regeneration and homeostasis. Its improper regulation can lead to aberrant cell growth, abnormal
development (malformation, dysplasia), and tumor formation. From a mathematical modeling perspective,
asymmetric cell division and its regulation are difficult to study because naturally occurring systems are
complex and often only partially understood genetically and molecularly. Experimental studies are also
difficult as it is hard to systematically perturb or tune the regulatory mechanisms governing differentiation.
To address the above issues, the Pis propose to use a synthetic biology approach to develop
mathematical modeling techniques that describe the spatiotemporal dynamics of cells undergoing
asymmetric cell division. In previous work, the Pis have developed a completely controllable synthetic
gene circuit that enables asymmetric cell division in E.coli. This system, though placed in a single celled
organism, can further be augmented to include other hallmarks of multicellular organisms such as cell-cell
signaling, cell motility, cell-cell adhesion, and growth rate regulation. By modularly combining synthetic
asymmetric cell division with these other phenomena, the Pis will have the ability to controllably alter and
fine-tune the regulatory mechanisms governing phenotypic differentiation. The Pis will then formulate
mathematical modeling techniques that span multiple length scales, from the small-scale molecular
mechanisms underlying the genetic regulatory pathways, to the large-scale physical forces that impact the
overall spatiotemporal patterning of the colonies. Overall, this research will lead to better mathematical
models of complex, differentiating multicellular systems."
10897235,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):
Proteins are the drivers of molecular activity in the cell, but we still lack a comprehensive understanding of
the mechanisms by which cells regulate protein abundances. A long-standing question has focused
specifically on the mechanisms and degree of post-transcriptional regulation, which also determines the
degree to which mRNA levels can be used to predict protein abundances. For example, mRNA levels
generally correlate with protein abundance across genes, but that mRNA-protein correlations can vary
significantly within genes across conditions, due in part to post-transcriptional regulation, such as
regulation of protein synthesis and degradation. Post-transcriptional regulation has been analyzed in bulk
samples composed of heterogeneous cell types, but it remains largely unexplored in single cells. To
enable systematic analysis of post-transcriptional regulation at single-cell resolution, we need a novel
analytic framework which 1) accounts for single-cell measurement error and technical bias, which are
convolved with the relevant biological signal for both mRNA and protein abundance 2) leverages
probabilistic models which pool information across genes in functional groups or account for the
determinants contributing to protein abundance, like ribosomal binding proteins 3) models
abundance-dependent missing data in single-cell mRNA and protein data and 4) associates observed
post-transcriptions regulation with likely regulatory mechanisms. To achieve these goals, we build upon
our long-standing collaboration and propose the following aims:
Aim 1. To develop methods for inferring post-transcriptional regulation in single cells. These methods will
employ hierarchical models which account for similarities between genes with common regulatory
mechanisms. We will explicitly model non-ignorable missing data and account for measurement error in
the data.
Aim 2. To apply and validate the methodology from Aim 1. We will analyze single-cell mRNA and protein
measurements from human immune cells and testis with a focus on identifying and validating functionally
related genes regulated by common RNA binding proteins.
The research will be integrated into the education programs at the Pl's institutions, with a particular focus
on capstone experiences. Reproducible software implementations for new tools will be developed."
10784214,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common primary intraocular tumor of adulthood, and radiation-based
therapies are the mainstay treatment for most small, medium, and some large UM. Despite high rates of local
tumor control, over two-thirds of patients are left with functional blindness in the treated eye due to radiation-
induced side effects. Radiation optic neuropathy (RON) is particularly devastating due to its strong association
with profound visual deficits and lack of effective treatment options. We recently identified a potential novel
opportunity for intervention based on a retrospective study identifying risk factors for RON. In our clinical
practice, we observed that some patients with RON manifested with concurrent neuroretinal rim thinning
(NRT). Based on this observation, we analyzed a number of potential risk factors for RON in patients treated
with plaque radiotherapy for UM and found that higher baseline intraocular pressure (IOP) was associated an
increased risk of RON. These data supported a hypothesis previously proposed in glaucomatous optic
neuropathies: Specifically, there is a pressure sensitive component to optic nerve injury, which is associated
with connective tissue stress and strain at the lamina cribrosa, that results in a cupping or NRT. Few animal
models accurately replicate this aspect of human anatomy due to a lack of a well-developed lamina cribrosa.
However, the tree shrew has a similar distinct, load-bearing lamina cribrosa, and is rapidly becoming an animal
model for studies in conditions including glaucoma and other optic neuropathies. Given our clinical observation
and growing use of the tree shrew as a model for optic nerve pathology, our Central Hypothesis is that a
novel model of RON can be developed using the tree shrew based on its load-bearing lamina cribrosa, which
will replicate characteristic features of human pathology and allow testing of novel therapeutics, specifically
those related to IOP reduction. Establishing a representative animal model will have potential to accelerate
new treatment approaches for patients with RON. We will evaluate our central hypothesis via two specific
aims. Aim 1 will validate the use of the tree shrew as a model for RON by performing a rigorous
assessment of the structural and functional phenotype of the tree shrew model of RON. Aim 2 will
examine the role of IOP regulation in the severity of RON. Based on strong clinical data with which to form
this hypothesis, these aims will support our long-term goal of developing novel treatment approaches including
IOP reduction to reduce the risk RON and prevent blindness in patients requiring exposure to radiation."

 This is a K08 award application for Dr. Nathan Blue, a Maternal-Fetal Medicine physician and young inves-
tigator pursuing translational and clinical research to improve risk stratification approaches to fetal growth re-
striction (FGR). A K08 award will provide him with the means to acquire critical skills in three key career devel-
opment areas: 1) programming skills to carry out analyses and visualizations (Unix, R, Python), 2) novel bio-
medical informatics approaches to quantify risk of adverse outcomes, and 3) interdisciplinary research leader-
ship and management. By acquiring these skills, Dr. Blue will fulfill his career goal of becoming an independent
investigator who can improve prenatal recognition of fetuses at risk of adverse outcomes. To pursue this goal,
Dr. Blue has assembled the mentoring team of Dr. Robert Silver (primary mentor), a Maternal-Fetal Medicine
physician and international authority on obstetric complications, Dr. Mark Yandell (co-mentor), a human genet-
ics scientist, expert in computational biology, and developer of medical risk assessment software tools, and Dr.
Martin Tristani-Firouzi (co-mentor), a Pediatric Cardiology physician and widely recognized leader in applica-
tion of new informatics tools to complex clinical problems such as congenital heart disease.
 Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is a leading cause of preventable stillbirths, postnatal complications, and re-
sults in a lifelong increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Based on his own published data, Dr. Blue’s central
hypothesis is that current fetal assessment tools function poorly because they assume all fetuses should be
the same size and fetal growth ultrasounds are interpreted in isolation of other factors that could be useful to
inform risk. He will test this hypothesis by analyzing maternal genetic variants and using a novel explainable
artificial intelligence (AI) method to develop individualized prediction models for expected fetal growth and risk
of perinatal morbidity. This will uncover insights into normal fetal growth as well as produce a new neonatal
morbidity risk calculator. By pursuing the following aims, Dr. Blue will test his hypothesis and lay the ground-
work for refining his new tools prior to application to fetal growth in a prospective cohort (to be proposed in an
R01 application during the K08 award period). Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that maternal genetic
information can be used to individualize birth weight prediction in uncomplicated pregnancies. Specific Aim 2
will test the hypothesis that genetics, specific clinical variables, and social determinants of health interact syn-
ergistically to increase the risk of poor outcomes in FGR, which can be captured by new explainable AI.
 The proposed research is significant because despite FGR’s enormous global burden, current approaches
to fetal growth assessment continue to perform poorly, forcing clinicians and families to make plans without
appropriately individualized information. The proposed research is innovative because of its use of 1) maternal
genetic rather than clinical data such as height, weight, and race to predict healthy birth weight, and 2) explain-
able AI for risk stratification rather than black-box AI techniques that are too opaque for trustworthy application."
10784286,"Project Summary
The durability of clinical responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD1 has generated tremendous
interest in immunotherapy of cancers. However, not all patients demonstrate a complete or durable response
and thus, there is a need to develop additional therapeutic antibodies (mAbs) that target other immune pathways
and can be used in combination with anti-PD1 therapies. Though the majority of the focus to date has been on
other inhibitory pathways such as CTLA4 and TIGIT, recent developments have suggested a role for mAbs
targeting co-stimulatory receptors, allowing for the introduction of therapies that not only release the proverbial
brakes of the immune system, but also apply the gas to get the immune response moving. One such
costimulatory receptor is GITR (TNFRSF18), a TNFR superfamily member surface receptor that is upregulated
on activated T cells and endogenously expressed on both Tregs and NK, though basal expression on NK cells
is considerably lower. As with many stimulatory receptors, GITR requires receptor clustering to reach the
activation threshold for signal transduction and cellular activation and thus, many studies involving agonistic anti-
GITR antibodies failed to show a significant clinical benefit in humans. Though mutant antibody Fc domains have
been developed that enable spontaneous hexamerization upon cell surface binding, the hexamerization also
enhances C1q binding and complement deposition, leading to an immunodepleting molecule with potent effector
functions. To broaden the applications of this platform, our lab has used a structure guided engineering approach
to identify additional mutations that can abrogate C1q binding, leading to a hexamerizing antibody with negligible
effector functions and one that is suitable for targeting and activating stimulatory receptors. In vitro luciferase
based bioassays demonstrated that when combined with a hexamerizing Fc domain, our agonistic anti-GITR
antibody demonstrates significantly enhanced stimulation and a unique synergistic effect with GITR-Ligand. The
first aim of this proposal looks to examine the in vivo efficacy of this agonistic, hexamerizing anti-GITR antibody
with augmented stimulatory capabilities using an established and well characterized orthotopic renal cell
carcinoma model in a humanized mouse. Additionally, advanced analytical techniques including single cell RNA
sequencing, immunohistochemistry, and multiparameter FACS will enable the in-depth evaluation of the
mechanistic and cellular differences resulting from therapeutic use of hexamerizing antibodies targeting
stimulatory receptors. The second aim further advances the therapeutic potential of this antibody by engineering
and testing in vivo, a hexamerizing bispecific antibody that targets both GITR and PD1. This molecule will both
rescue exhausted immune cells and stimulate activated T cells, allowing for remodeling of the tumor
microenvironment and restoration of anti-tumor immunity. This proposal not only will evaluate the therapeutic
potential of a novel Fc domain and bispecific antibody, but also provide valuable insight into the mechanistic
differences resulting from enhanced receptor signaling and combination therapies."

11180574,"Health disparities in the United States have their origins as early as the prenatal period. Early life conditions including poverty and discrimination generate disparities in health over the life course that become further entrenched in the population through their transmission across generations. Parental mental health, which is strongly linked with social and economic disadvantage as well as child development, may play a key mediating role in the transmission of disparities across generation, but a persistent gap in the disparities literature is that both maternal and paternal psychopathology have not been fully considered as mechanisms nor measured using phenotypically validated approaches. As a result, though disparities in health are well documented, the developmental mechanisms that impact disparities at the very beginning of life are not, particularly those which lead to developmental deficits that emerge long before disease states. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) strategic plan (2021-2025 ) highlights the need for research to improve “understanding mechanisms that lead to disparities by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status.” Such enhanced understanding is needed to clarify the etiology of disparities – particularly the specific exposures linked with social or economic disadvantage that impact early development.
Advancing knowledge of the developmental mechanisms that generate disparities requires a more thorough understanding of how socioeconomic and race/ethnic status influence the determinants of development from gestation onward. To accomplish this, more in-depth measurement of potential causes of disparities is needed from more diverse samples starting earlier in the life course are needed than is currently available from existing studies.
The Division of Population Health Research (DiPHR) is examining evidence- and theory-based risk and protective factors for maternal health during pregnancy and child development that are expected to be affected by inequalities at the individual, family, and neighborhood levels. This prospective observational cohort study will enroll a socioeconomically and racially and ethnically diverse cohort totaling approximately 2,000 women and their partners during the first trimester of pregnancy and conduct follow-up assessments through pregnancy, delivery and the first year of their offspring’s life.

Asthma is a common chronic disease, and some women experience exacerbation and worsening of their asthma during pregnancy while others improve. Patients with asthma may have a defect in regulatory T (Treg) cells, which favors further TH2-cell proliferation. Treg cells are integral to the process by which the immune system differentiates foreign antigens (pathogens, etc.) and self-antigens and, as such, they also play a key role in mediating pregnancy tolerance. This clinical research study aimed to increase understanding of factors that predict poor asthma control during pregnancy as well as add to improve knowledge of the basic immunology of pregnancy. The B-WELL-Mom Study, a multicenter prospective cohort study, aims to increase understanding of factors that predict poor asthma control during pregnancy, and that add to our knowledge of the basic immunology of pregnancy . This Task Order will provide for storage and maintenance of approximately 22,660 specimens collected in the B Well Mom study.
This study investigates predictors of asthma control variability during pregnancy including demographic, biologic, genetic and environmental factors with particular interest in the role of maternal allergy. Pregnancy requires the immune system to tolerate the “not self” fetus and the clinical presentation of asthma including improvement or worsening will contribute to knowledge of the basic immunology of pregnancy. Women who get worse during pregnancy may represent a vulnerable subgroup with respect to environmental exposures, such as poor air quality, which can exacerbate asthma and may have an independent effect on poor pregnancy outcomes."

on low-income. We will increase UBR community-based partnerships by at least 20%, and we
will have >60% retention by Year 5. Five of our institutions are founding members of the All of Us Research Program (AoU) California Precision Medicine Consortium (CAPMC), which has met or exceeded its milestones for recruitment, retention, including UBRs, for the past six years. The new sites were chosen because they complement existing sites not only with highly diverse populations, but also diversification in institution types and locations: RIQI, a Health
Information Exchange (HIE) covering the whole state of Rhode Island; PRCCI, a research institute with sites all over Puerto Rico; and Yale, a research university in the state of Connecticut. An HIE will allow us to understand the efficacy of shifting the existing model of having healthcare provider organizations (HPOs) recruit from their sites, to having the hub of a network of organizations select among any of its contributing sites, allowing to focus on sites enriched for UBRs. PRCCI is a consortium of clinical research sites in Puerto Rico, where
74% of the population is UBR. The population covered by Yale New Haven Health reflects the
contrasts of Connecticut, which has the highest per capita income in the country, but where 25%
of the population lives in poverty. Of the four new institutions, three have begun already started
recruiting via supplements to CAPMC (Yale and PRCCI) or via the AoU Nutrition for Precision
Health study (UCLA).
Our multidisciplinary team has a strong track record of collaborative research, which facilitates
working together successfully. Contact PI Lucila Ohno-Machado has been the contact PI for
CAPMC, and she has more than 25 years of experience serving as PI/program director (PI/PD)
for NIH research/training grants and service contracts. Dr. Ohno-Machado has deep working
relationships with each PI and provides an inclusive, collaborative environment. Our multi-PI
team has a combination of leaders in their fields and emerging leaders, and itself represents the
diversity we strive to recruit and retain. Of 11 MPIs, only four are male; various racial and ethnic
groups are represented; there are MDs, MD/PhDs, and PhDs in various areas. Our staff are
equally diverse and reflect the communities we serve. We have established partnerships and will
continue to collaborate with the San Diego Blood Bank (also in the AoU Direct Volunteer
Program), various Federally Qualified Healthcare Centers (FQHC), as well as multiple
community partners. We share lessons learned and value the privilege of being part of AoU.

The U.S. health care system faces dual challenges: a continuing quality chasm and costs that are growing faster than the economy. The unifying concept of value, or health outcomes achieved per dollar spent, simultaneously addresses these challenges. The mission of the Center for Innovation to Implementation (Ci2i) will be to produce health services research in pursuit of high-value health care through better access, quality and wiser use of resources. Ci2i will have three thematic research goals (focus areas):   "" Fostering high-value mental health care (e.g., substance use disorder) where suboptimal access and   underuse are common,   "" Fostering high-value medical specialty care for chronic disease (e.g., heart, liver, and renal disease),   where costly hospitalizations, procedures and drugs demand better management, and   "" Advancing methods to assess and improve value through better modeling and informatics.  Together, these clinical areas provide a generalizable portfolio of diverse domains in which value opportunities lie. The methodological innovations produced will support Ci2i's work and advance this field of inquiry. Though we concentrate on specialty care, our purview is not confined to specialists' offices; improving value may mean transforming some care now delivered in specialty settings to lower cost, more accessible venues, such as primary care or even self-care. The concept of the ""Value Frontier,"" or the optimal allocation of resources- given current technology-to produce health, guides our research agenda. We will examine where the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) currently operates below the Value Frontier, to identify opportunities for innovation. We will then evaluate clinical and organizational innovations that either move care towards the frontier or transform care more fundamentally by expanding the frontier, particularly through the use of provider-facing informatics. In so doing, Ci2i will take advantage of the exceptionally fertile local environment at our academic affiliates of Stanford University and the University of California San Francisco for enhancing cost-effectiveness modeling, implementation science and structured health systems redesign.  In addition to value-oriented research, Ci2i will advance health services research more generally, with particular support for research into the special populations of women and older Veterans. It will continue Palo Alto's tradition as a leader in career development of junior investigators locally and nationally through innovative use of distance mentoring and collaboration. Promoting their career development will be central to Ci2i's commitment to growing the next generation of high value health care investigators.  Core investigators' extensive, deep and longstanding network of connections to implementation research centers and delivery system partners will ensure that the innovations we test are relevant to health system needs. The local presence of three Quality Enhancement Research Initiatives (QUERI's) will facilitate hand-off of proven innovations for study of their implementation and for wider dissemination. Ci2i will provide infrastructure support
to these and other health services researchers nationwide committed to having a role in VHA's continued journey toward being a learning organization that delivers high-value care. In all of its
endeavors, Ci2i is designed to be a model for the new breed of health services research built for both rigor and relevance in support of Veterans' health."
11032586,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Acetylcholine (ACh) release in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) is important for reversal learning, a form of
cognitive flexibility impaired in schizophrenia and other psychiatric and neurologic disorders. Thalamic activity is
necessary for DMS ACh release, and functional connectivity between the thalamus and the dorsal striatum is
impaired in schizophrenia and other disorders, suggesting thalamostriatal regulation of ACh release may be a
potential target for treatment of impaired cognition. However, it is unknown when and how thalamostriatal
projections regulate striatal ACh release to update behavior and facilitate neuronal value encoding during
reversal learning. To address this gap in knowledge, I will use a combination of fiber photometry, computational
modeling, optogenetics, and high-density in vivo electrophysiology. To test the hypothesis that DMS ACh release
accelerates learning rate, I will optogenetically inhibit DMS cholinergic interneurons during reward consumption
in a reversal learning task and I will use an advanced reinforcement learning model to determine how this affects
the rate at which the learning rate changes. To test the hypothesis that thalamostriatal projections are necessary
for DMS acetylcholine release and reversal learning, I will use a retrograde viral strategy to determine whether
projection-specific inhibition of thalamic inputs to the DMS during reward consumption decreases ACh release
and impairs reversal learning. Finally, to test the hypothesis that DMS ACh release expedites value updating in
medium spiny neurons I will simultaneously measure DMS ACh release with fiber photometry and striatal neuron
activity with electrophysiology to determine whether DMS ACh release correlates with the rate at which striatal
neurons update spike encoding of action value. This work will be performed at the New York State Psychiatric
Institute and the Columbia University Irving Medical Center Department of Psychiatry. Together these institutions
form a leading academic medical center and teaching hospital that has attracted a distinguished group of
research scientists who provide leadership in modern psychiatry. My long-term career goal is to become an
independent investigator studying the contribution of neuromodulation to behaviors and neural activity relevant
to mental disorders. I have a strong background in optogenetics, behavioral neuroscience, and fiber photometry,
which I will utilize in the proposed research. However, I still need additional training in advanced computational
modeling of behavior and in vivo electrophysiology with high-density silicon probes. I will receive this technical
training during the K01 award period, as well as professional development training to improve my grant-writing,
leadership, and science communication skills. The conducted research and training during this career
development award will increase my likelihood of success in becoming a leading neuroscientist and independent
investigator."

This K23 application is to support the research and career development of Dr. Dayane Oliveira by providing her
with an intensive mentored experience in order for her to complete the transition to an independent clinician-
scientist with a patient-centered research program focused on an unexplored area of designing and
implementing novel dental biomaterials using red light in their application. Light-cured materials revolutionized
dentistry as they allowed to control the setting of the materials in a timely manner simply upon light exposure.
The use of light-cured materials in dentistry was made possible by adding photoinitiators to the composition of
dental materials. Although blue light has been routinely used to cure dental restorative materials for over 50
years, there are still potential risks to dental patients. These risks include gingiva burn/recession and pulp
inflammation that can lead to necrosis in more severe situations caused/induced by the heat generated by this
short wavelength. As well as the direct effects on the gingival and pulpal cells, including the induction of
irreversible reactive oxygen species levels imbalance, damage to the mitochondrial DNA, and collagen
degradation. On the other hand, long wavelengths (such as red light) are known to induce less heat and have
opposing effects on cellular function, reducing inflammation and increasing cell proliferation. Although the blue-
light hazards in dentistry are well known, little can be done as to date as there were no photoinitiators capable
of absorbing longer wavelengths. Our group has overcome this hurdle by synthesizing a dental photoinitiator
activated by red light, thus opening the door for red light to be used in restorative dental procedures. Our in vitro
preliminary data demonstrate the positive effects of red light on temperature during the curing process as well
as on fibroblast and odontoblast viability and their initial signaling responses. Thus, as the next step in filling this
clinical need, we here propose to conduct an exploratory Phase 1 medical device study combined with a
further ex vivo mechanistic study as the next logical steps in translating this improved clinical care from
laboratory findings to clinical practice. Our central hypothesis is that longer wavelengths will mitigate pulpal
and gingival damage during dental restorative procedures. The results of this work will lay the groundwork to
support a future medical device Phase 2 study application in order to achieve the long-term goal of using red
light as a new strategy for light-curing in Dentistry. Thus, ensuring a safer and more effective treatment strategy
to improve oral health. Dr. Oliveira has established a multi-disciplinary mentoring team to provide expertise in
translational research training and mentorship in her career development. A training plan including didactic,
hands-on, and career development experiences has been put forth to enable this transition together with this
strong research plan."
10308560,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Background. Over half of Veterans report musculoskeletal (MSK) pain, often with mental health comorbidities.
Complementary and integrative health (CIH) therapies are important non-pharmacologic treatment options for
these conditions. However, CIH is not widely available at the VA. Also, practitioner-delivered therapies (i.e.,
acupuncture or chiropractic) are promising, but providers would like patients to be more active in their pain
management by using self-care (i.e., meditation, tai chi, yoga) instead of relying on practitioner-delivered care.
A critical question for the field is whether adding self-care CIH to practitioner-delivered CIH is a more effective
approach than either strategy alone. However, we are unaware of anyone examining this. Also, to-date,
studying CIH in large VA samples has been difficult because few facilities capture CIH use with codes in their
electronic health records, and very few use the VA's standardized codes, preventing multi-site studies. In 2016,
Congress passed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act mandating expansion of CIH therapies in
VA. In response, 18 VA regional networks committed $5 million/yr to implement CIH therapies at 18 sites
beginning in 2018, focusing on five evidence-based therapies: acupuncture, chiropractic, Tai Chi, mindfulness,
and yoga. The VA's Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation (OPCC&CT) will oversee this
effort, including the data collection efforts targeting 1,000 CIH users from each of the 18 sites. We propose
addressing the above gaps by continue our longstanding collaboration with OPCC&CT to capitalize on 1) the
2018 rollout of CIH in 18 VA sites and 2) our two current national/multisite studies of the effects of CIH, one on
MSK pain and the other which integrates CIH patient reported outcomes (PROs) measurement into clinical
care. We propose a large-scale pragmatic comparative effectiveness clinical trial to assess CIH. In the UG3
Planning Phase, as the 18 sites begin implementing CIH, we will develop and implement data collection
instruments and processes that we are currently piloting to capture CIH use and PROs: 1) pain and its intensity
and interference, 2) global physical and mental health and 3) fatigue. We also will examine opioid use. To
inform that measurement, we will use multiple strategies, including an Advisory Board. In the UH3
Implementation Phase, we will conduct a 3-arm pragmatic trial using an encouragement design to assess the
longitudinal comparative effectiveness of: 1) practitioner-delivered care (acupuncture or chiropractic
care) combined with self-care (Tai Chi, meditation/mindfulness or yoga) compared to 2) practitioner-delivered
care alone or 3) self-care alone. We will examine outcomes at 3 and 6 months for OPCC&CT's target sample of
18,000 CIH users. We will use randomized “nudges” (e.g., educational brochures with class listings) tailored to
each site to encourage Veterans who use one type of CIH to consider a combination of therapies."
11011627,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
A critical need exists to identify factors which place sensitized individuals at risk for anaphylaxis in order to
devise targeted therapies to limit reaction severity. In the absence of the proposed work, allergic individuals –
frequently children – will be at continuously increasing risk for anaphylaxis with potentially fatal consequences.
Recently the Principle Investigator (PI) identified increased TPSAB1 copy number as the common cause of
elevated basal serum tryptase (BST), a well-established risk factor for severe anaphylaxis. The long-term goal
of this project is to develop therapies targeting the symptoms associated with increased TPSAB1 expression,
including anaphylaxis, in humans. The principle objective of this proposal is to determine how increased
TPSAB1 expression in myeloid cells alters their reciprocal relationship with neighboring cells to promote
severe allergic reactions. Based upon clinical observations and published reports, the central hypothesis for
this proposal is that elevated BST due to increased TPSAB1-derived tryptase expression promotes
myeloproliferation and anaphylaxis in humans. Our rationale is that through identification of the mechanism(s)
leading to TPSAB1 over-expression and by defining the activities of these tryptases in vivo, new therapeutic
strategies will be developed to prevent anaphylaxis and target myeloid dyscrasias. To test our central
hypothesis, we propose three specific aims to: (1) elucidate mechanisms by which specific tryptase expression
patterns promote severe allergic reactions; (2) identify pathways governing TPSAB1 gene expression and
associated myeloid proliferation; (3) define additional pathways essential to severe allergic reactions by
identifying novel genetic mutations leading to elevated BST and anaphylaxis. This project is significant
because it will establish mechanisms by which elevated BST and associated myeloproliferation can promote
severe allergic reactions and anaphylaxis, and identify targets for therapeutic intervention. This project is
based upon our identification of the role that TPSAB1 copy number variation and gene expression play in BST
levels. This major conceptual advance was enabled by state-of-the-art genotyping and gene expression
assays developed by the PI. In this project, these tools will be applied in an innovate manner: 1) to devise a
non-invasive strategy to identify patients in whom clonal myeloid disease is highly probable; and 2) to dissect
the relationship(s) between tryptase isoform expression, elevated BST, anaphylaxis, and clonal myeloid
disease. Furthermore, the central hypothesis will be tested in an innovative system, employing a humanized /
bone marrow xenotransplantation mouse model that optimizes myeloid engraftment, not previously used to
study anaphylaxis. The proposed studies will provide important insights into the pathways governing severe
allergic reactions in humans, and bridge the disparate fields of allergy and oncology. Understanding how
increased TPSAB1 expression can alter myeloid phenotypes and promote these reactions will allow for
development of novel therapies targeting anaphylaxis and clonal myeloid disease."

The challenge lies in how to best tap this plethora of data, to build explanatory and predictive models of living systems, and to discover the biomarkers that will lead to improved medical diagnoses and treatments. The critical bottleneck lies in software support for enabling discovery. The next generation software platform for scientific discovery will require a focus on sustainability, security, user-experience, and accessibility.
The Blackfynn Platform directly addresses these needs, enabling team science for big data.  Our platform provides a single seamless point of data access and management for multi-modal data. It enables rapid viewing and search, integration and linking of data across modalities, followed by analysis via custom or standardized tools. Our commitment to the SPARC program is focused on three main thrusts: 
-	Develop a cloud-based scientific data management platform tailored to the needs of SPARC investigators. Blackfynn will expand its platform to support the specific needs of the SPARC investigators and develop infrastructure to integrate with deliverables from the SPARC SIM-CORE and MAP-CORE. 
-	Drive collaborative efforts with the other SPARC cores and investigators and promote interoperability and seamless integration of systems. Blackfynn will develop processes and tools to support coordination within the SPARC program. We will create an open architecture and enhance our platform to foster collaboration and tool interoperability.  
-	Develop a sustainable ecosystem for the neuroscience community outside and beyond the SPARC initiative. Efforts in this project will be lost without a clear strategy to expand use of the selected platform(s) beyond the SPARC effort. We will work with the SPARC team to develop solutions to guarantee sustainability and develop an open data exchange platform that can be used by anyone to find and access public data hosted on the Blackfynn platform at cost."

IT’IS Foundation, SIM-Core 
SIM-Core’s mission is to ensure that the computational models and analyses developed under the SPARC program are accessible, sustainably preserved, reusable, and interoperable. To this end, a comprehensive, user-friendly Open platform for Online Simulations for Stimulating Peripheral Activity to Relieve Conditions (o2S2PARC) has been developed. o2S2PARC enables computational models and analyses to be published as reusable building blocks (‘services’) in larger pipelines and workflows that can be shared and accessed via common web browsers and executed in the cloud. Workflows created by expert modelers can be packaged as easy-to-use applications using o2S2PARC’s ‘Guided Mode’ to provide, for example, a treatment-planning tool that can be used by clinicians with little modeling expertise. Close interaction with other SPARC teams allows continuous adaption of the platform design to facilitate integration and coupling of new models. To date, o 2S2PARC has provided many dozens of services developed by SPARC researchers and SIM-Core to facilitate tasks such as image processing and image-based modeling, mechanistic and data-driven biophysical simulation (electromagnetic, electrophysiology, organ physiology, etc.), training and application of deep neural networks, parameterized modeling, and explorable data analysis and visualization. o2S2PARC provides access to detailed whole-body anatomical models and enables biophysiological simulations within realistic representations of the anatomical environment. The ultimate goal of o2S2PARC is to enable modeling of bioelectronics medicine applications, from device-level physical interactions with the peripheral nervous system/spinal cord through to the resulting therapeutic effects on organ physiology, while also providing advance warning of potential unwanted side effects. Developers benefit from powerful application programming interfaces, e.g., for setting up and running complex simulations using the computational resources provided by SPARC. IT’IS is committed to maintaining the o2S2PARC platform and developing a sustainability plan beyond the SPARC program. In the coming months, the IT’IS team will continue to harden and increase stability and scalability to accommodate increased use. Integration with the SPARC data, maps, and knowledge management will be tightened, and a dedicated effort will be made to increase the attractiveness of o2S2PARC and other SPARC resources to application developers."
11160985,"Summary/Abstract for NIH-SPARC MAP-CORE
The aim of this project is to provide tools for visualising data and models generated by the SPARC (Stimulating Peripheral Activity to Relieve Conditions) consortium, which is generating data and models associated with the autonomic nervous system. By mapping the paths of these nerves throughout the body and understanding their role in controlling organ function, the NIH funded program will help provide the means for medical device companies to develop new stimulators that can modulate organ function in order to improve physiological function and hence relieve a medical condition.
The MAP-CORE is one of three components of the Data and Resource Centre (DRC) for SPARC. DAT- CORE will manage the actual data generated by the SPARC community. MAP-CORE will integrate the multiple types of data (also from multiple species) into a cohesive whole, and organise and display it in a way that is useful to both the SPARC science community and the medical device companies.
SIM-CORE will develop a framework, including simulation tools, to connect mathematical models of neural and other physiological activity based on the SPARC data.
The MAP-CORE will ensure that suitable community standards such as CellML, SBML, FieldML and SED-ML are used (and if necessary, further developed) for encoding and annotating the data, models and simulations to ensure reproducibility, and to help ensure that all data and models are appropriately annotated to make them findable and accessible by the community in the DAT-CORE database. MAP-CORE will use ApiNATOMY to provide annotations for biological context and a framework for implementing biophysical concepts such as conservation of mass and conservation of energy. A portal, based on web 2.0 and subsequent standards, will be developed that brings the anatomy and multiscale physiology of all organ systems into a single database-driven user interface. The user will be able to examine data and models at all scales and to generate predictive multiscale models (solved with the SIM-CORE tools) to answer specific questions associated with the autonomic control of the visceral organs."

There is palpable excitement in the oncology community that we are on the cusp of a major advance in how we
treat bladder (urothelial) cancer. Recent efforts to comprehensively define the landscape of genetic alterations
in urothelial cancer and to understand their impact on drug sensitivity, as well as the exciting early results with
immune targeting strategies suggest that prospective molecular profiling of blood and tumor tissue could
improve the outcomes of urothelial cancer patients by personalizing care. This MSK SPORE in Bladder Cancer
seeks to leverage recently initiated multicenter efforts to explore the molecular basis of inherited genetic
susceptibility, exploit prospective molecular characterization to guide treatment, and to test the efficacy of
immunotherapy-based combination approaches. The overall translational aims of the MSK SPORE in Bladder
Cancer are to 1) develop predictive biomarkers of response and resistance to immunotherapy, chemotherapy,
and investigational treatments; 2) identify germline genetic alterations that confer increased risk for the
development of urothelial cancer; and 3) identify mechanisms of immunotherapy resistance and develop
combinatorial strategies to enhance immunotherapy response in patients with urothelial cancer. To pursue
these aims, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with complementary expertise in the clinical
management of urothelial cancer, inheritable risk, mycobacterial and cancer biology, cancer genetics,
molecular pathology, biostatistics, computational biology, and multiplatform data integration. The translational
aims of this SPORE will be pursued through four projects, each of which addresses a different clinical state in
the evolution of the disease. Project 1 will use prospective molecular characterization to determine, in the
context of a cooperative group trial, whether transurethral resection and chemotherapy, without the need for
cystectomy, is curative in patients with DNA damage response gene alterations and to identify novel
biomarkers of chemotherapy sensitivity. Project 2 will identify and functionally characterize novel germline
variants that confer increased inherited susceptibility. Project 3 will seek to identify and validate tumor- and
blood-based predictive biomarkers of response to systemic immune checkpoint blockade in patients with
metastatic urothelial cancer in the context of a randomized, multicenter trial. Project 4 will seek to identify
predictive biomarkers of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) response and BCG strains with greater activity as a
prelude to future clinical trials. Each of these projects will be supported by the Biospecimen Repository and the
Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core, which will assist with the preparation and analysis of human tissues and
genomic, immune, and clinical data, and an Administrative Core will ensure project integration. Finally,
developmental research projects and career mentorship are fully integrated into the SPORE to ensure that a
future generation of researchers is prepared to further advance our long-term objectives of enhancing therapy,
reducing the morbidity of treatments, and ultimately eliminating this disease as a cause of premature death."
10547799,"While HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) provide potent protection from HIV-1, to date they have
been difficult to induce in the setting of vaccination. A second type of HIV-1 envelope (Env) antibodies that are
easy to induce are termed non-neutralizing antibodies (NNAbs) (because they are not bnAbs), or called
effector antibodies, because they mediate a myriad of potentially protective anti-HIV-1 effector mechanisms.
One of the 5 Phase IIb HIV-1 vaccine efficacy trials (ALVAC/AIDSVAX in RV144) showed an estimated
vaccine efficacy of 31%, with a correlate of decreased transmission risk of polyfunctional antibodies that
mediate FcR-anti-HIV-1 activities including C1 and V2-targeted ADCC. Currently there are two vaccine
efficacy trials ongoing to test the ability of an ALVAC-C, bivalent C/C gp120 boost (HVTN 702) and rAd26
prime, gp140 protein boost (HVTN 705) with hopes of inducing protective NNAbs. HVTN 702 has two wildtype
(WT) gp120 Envs as boosts, and HVTN 705 has one WT Env as boost. However, neither trial utilitize
strategies for inducing a breadth of NNAbs with boosting Env design. Thus, a key goal of current HIV-1
vaccine development is to develop the simplest and most effective vaccine that induces polyfunctional NNAbs
should either of the current efficacy trials fail to improve on RV144.
 Our overall goals are 1) to develop an ADCC mosaic multivalent Env immunogen to follow an ALVAC-C

10209955,"Background
Eating disorders (EDs) likely affect a significant proportion of female and male Veterans; however, they remain
understudied and under-treated in VA. Individuals with EDs are likely to be high users of medical care, which is
at least partly due to the physical complications of EDs. Nonetheless, EDs often go undetected in general
medical settings, unless providers screen for them. Currently, the VA does not routinely screen for EDs; thus,
enhancing VA's capacity nationally to provide comprehensive care for Veterans with EDs is a priority area of
focus. This proposal will address four major gaps: the lack of prevalence estimates of EDs in nationally
representative samples of Veterans, the lack of knowledge of healthcare needs and preferences of Veterans
with EDs, the paucity of findings regarding military/Veteran-specific risk factors for EDs, the lack of a validated
screening measure for EDs in Veterans, and the lack of knowledge regarding Veteran preferences for ED
screening. These gaps are barriers to screening for and treating Veterans with EDs in VA healthcare.
Objectives
The specific aims are to establish a nationally representative cohort of male and female Veterans in order to: 1)
a) examine the prevalence of male and female Veterans reporting full and subthreshold EDs and b) to examine
the potential prevalence of EDs among vulnerable subgroups of Veterans; 2) to identify service use and needs
among male and female Veterans with full and subthreshold EDs; 3) to estimate models of risk and protective
factors for EDs, including military sexual trauma, combat trauma, and unit and family deployment support; and
4) to validate an existing screening measure of EDs in a Veteran sample and assess screening preferences.
Methods
In order to achieve these aims, we will recruit a nationally representative sample of 1500 male and female
Veterans. We will request that the VA/DoD Identity Repository (VADIR), a VA office with access to Department
of Defense records, assist in randomly selecting 3750 individuals from the national Veteran population. We will
stratify the sample based on race/ethnicity and oversample women to achieve a 1:1 ratio. We will mail a
comprehensive survey to potential participants using a multi-pronged, six-stage mailing strategy.
Participants will complete survey measures of ED symptoms, risk and protective factors, and VA and non-VA
healthcare service and needs. Aim 1: sample weighting procedures will be used in order to calculate nationally
representative prevalence estimates of EDs among male and female Veterans. Aim 2: Poisson regression will
be used to compare healthcare service use for Veterans with EDs to Veterans without EDs. In addition, we will
use descriptive statistics to report service use among male and female Veterans with full and subthreshold
EDs and which services, if available, they would like to use. Aim 3: structural equation modeling will be used to
estimate models of risk and protective factors for EDs. Aim 4: Receiver Operating Characteristic curves will be
used to estimate sensitivity and specificity of the ED screening measure, regression models will be used to
investigate criterion validity, and descriptive statistics will be used to describe Veteran screening preferences.
Dissemination Plan
We will share our findings with our Operational Partners on monthly workgroup calls and make
recommendations based on these results. Our findings regarding the scope of EDs among Veterans and their
healthcare use and preferences will be used to inform ongoing provider trainings in EDs. We also will
disseminate findings during Women's Health Cyberseminars and via newsletters such as the Women's Health
Roundup. We will develop clinician and executive briefs in order to disseminate findings to both clinicians and
policy-makers. Thus, our results will be summarized and disseminated to VA leadership in a timely manner.

11061528,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Persons living with HIV (PLWH) are living longer with antiretroviral therapy (ART). Unfortunately, older
PLWH also appear to be at increased risk for HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). In parallel, as
a person ages, there is risk of developing neurodegenerative disorders of late life, including Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) or its precursor, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). A current challenge lies in
disentangling HAND from the more deleterious and progressive aMCI diagnosis. Distinguishing between aMCI
and HAND is critical in order to provide the most appropriate life planning, intervention and treatment options
for patients and to properly identify biological mechanisms of HAND. Studies that propose to identify biological
mechanisms of HAND, without careful recognition that some HAND cases may either additionally have aMCI
and or may have aMCI misdiagnosed as HAND, may lead to problematical mechanistic examinations of an
unclear phenotype. We believe that our proposal is particularly innovative in its approach because it first
attempts to clarify the phenotype of aMCI among PLWH and then examine its neurobiologic underpinnings.
 Participants will include PLWH who were characterized neuropsychologically in life and also have plasma,
CSF, and/or neuropathologic samples available for additional characterization. Samples and data come from
the National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium (of which the California NeuroAIDS Tissue Network at UCSD is
one of four contributing banks), the UCSD HIV Neurobehavioral Research Program (HNRP) and the UCSD
Shiley-Marcos Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC). To find aMCI among PLWH, the aims use both
1) an empirically-based neuropsychological diagnostic approach, and 2) a data-driven latent class analysis
(LCA) approach, which will allow us to better identify neuropsychological and biological characteristics
distinguishing HAND from aMCI. Specifically, Aim 1 will use the neuropsychological diagnostic approach to
identify aMCI among PLWH and compare profiles of aMCI- and HAND-associated biological markers and
neurocognitive trajectories among HIV+ and HIV- diagnostic groups. Aim 2 will use a data-driven latent class
analysis (LCA) approach to classify PLWH as aMCI, HAND or cognitively normal, and similarly compare
profiles of aMCI- and HAND-associated biological markers and neurocognitive trajectories among LCA groups
and HIV- diagnostic groups. Aim 3 will compare and validate the diagnostic and LCA classification methods.
 The public health benefits of our project would be significant if it is able to identify PLWH who have aMCI
and reliably distinguish it from HAND. This capability would: 1) allow us to apply the approach to all PLWH to
aid in identification of those at increased risk for progression to AD dementia, 2) allow for appropriate
treatments to be implemented, e.g., HAND-specific treatments or aMCI/AD-specific treatments, and for these
to be applied as early as possible in the course of the disease, and 3) allay fears among PLWH who do not
have aMCI, a significantly more debilitating disorder that confers greater risk for dementia than HAND."

that: 1) dogs alter the microbial composition of dust in homes, 2) children born into homes with dogs have
different developmental patterns of gut microbiota and of IgE, 3) a distinct pattern of gut microbial composition
at 1 month of age is related to heightened risk of sensitization to multiple allergens at 2 years and of asthma at
4 years, and this pattern is influenced by numerous maternal characteristics, 4) sensitization to multiple food
and inhalant allergens at 2 years is strongly related to asthma at 10 years, 5) the metabolic profiles of stools
are related to later allergic sensitization 6) 12,13-DiHOME, a metabolite in stool, promotes development of Th2
lymphocytes and lowers development of Treg lymphocytes in an in vitro assay, and 7) in another study, the
meconial microbiota is distinct in neonates born to mothers with asthma. Our complementary mouse studies
have shown that: 1) gavaging with dust from homes with dogs reduces lung inflammation from allergen
sensitization and from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, 2) dog dust gavaged mice have increases in
Lactobacillus johnsonii in their ceca 3) oral administration of live L. johnsonii confers protection against
pulmonary inflammation induced by allergen and RSV, 4) L. johnsonii alters the function of bone marrow-
derived dendritic cells, 5) mice orally supplemented with L. johnsonii have altered serum metabolic profiles,
and 6) mouse pups born to L. johnsonii-supplemented mothers are protected against allergen challenge and
RSV infection. Collectively these findings showing the influence of maternal factors provide the basis for this
application's focus on the maternal gut and vaginal microbiotas during pregnancy, and how these relate to
infant gut microbial development and risk of allergic asthma. Project 1 focuses on the relationship of maternal
environmental and dietary factors, including maternal and infant gut microbiotas, to the child's developing a
high-risk for asthma phenotype by age 2 years. Project 2 proposes a detailed examination of relationships
between maternal and child microbiota, breast milk composition and IgE development amongst a cohort of
pregnancies in which the mother has current allergic asthma. Project 3 synergistically interacts with Projects 1
& 2 and also uses specimens from 10-year-old allergic asthma cases and controls in the initial P01 birth cohort
to examine gut microbes producing metabolites associated with a lowered risk of allergic inflammation and how
they are transferred from mother and established in offspring. Project 4 will use mouse models to examine the
relationships between manipulation of maternal microbiota and immune development in offspring. We
anticipate that together these studies will show that interventions directed at the gut microbiota of mothers
during pregnancy and of high-risk neonates after birth could reduce the risk of allergic asthma in childhood.
Such findings would provide the foundations of a rational strategy to prevent allergic asthma."
10843091,"OVERALL PROGRAM SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting >6 million older
people in the USA for which there is no viable treatment option. Accordingly, defining the earliest cellular and
molecular mechanisms that drive the preclinical phase of dementia to develop novel disease modifying
therapeutics is a public health priority worldwide. The thrust of our PPG entitled “Neurobiology of Mild
Cognitive Impairment in the Elderly” continues to be to elucidate the cellular and molecular basis or chain of
events leading from no cognitive impairment (NCI) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the time-points
considered the most likely therapeutic windows for treating dementia. Moreover, we continue to focus our
efforts on NCI subjects with AD pathology suggestive of preclinical AD, in order to resolve the molecular and
cellular neuropathogenic sequela underlying this preclincal stage of the disease. We will implement a series of
interrelated connectome projects centered on the cholinergic basal forebrain (CBF)-default mode network
(DMN) circuit, which is critical for memory and executive function and displays early pathology and biomaker
activity prior to MCI (prodromal AD). CBF neuron dysfunction plays a pivotal role in the onset of clinical
dementia and is the basis for the majority of FDA approved drugs for AD. This PPG competitive renewal
application continues to bring together a number of basic and clinical scientists with multidisciplinary,
complementary expertise in preclinical AD to investigate circuit-based neuronal system dysfunction at the
earliest stages in the disease process. The PPG includes an Administrative & Clinical/Tissue Distribution Core,
a Statistics & Data Management Core and three research projects titled: Tau Abnormalities and Mild Cognitive
Impairment in the Elderly Scott Counts, Project Leader, PL, Michigan State University, Cholinergic Basal
Forebrain Neurotrophic Abnormalities and Mild Cognitive Impairment in the Elderly (Elliott Mufson, PL, Barrow
Neurologic Institute/Banner Alzheimer’s Institute), and Synaptic and Cholinergic Abnormalities in Mild
Cognitive Impairment in the Elderly (Milos Ikonomovic, PL University of Pittsburgh). The Cores support each
Project and all Projects interact intellectually, scientifically, and thematically. All Cores and Projects utilize
the same Rush Religious Orders Study (RROS) cases and tissues for continuity, which confers the ability to
correlate biologic measures with cognitive and neuropathological criterion. The lack of true animal models and
a lack of efficacy of current drugs make our human clinical pathological studies particularly relevant for
understanding mechanisms of preclinical AD."

9664963,"The mission of the Center to Improve Veteran Involvement in Care (CIVIC), located at VA Portland Health
Care System (VAPORHCS), is to conduct research that empowers Veterans to improve their health through
engagement in self-care, engagement with VA and non-VA healthcare systems, and engagement in health
services research. This mission supports several VHA 2018-2024 strategic objectives including empowering
Veterans to improve their health and to make healthcare decisions by ensuring transparency of information,
and emphasizing Veterans’ and their families’ whole health and wellness. Secretary Shulkin’s 2018 Five
Priorities for VA reaffirm the importance of creating new processes and systems that support Veteran-centric
decision-making around care and care settings. CIVIC proposes six main goals and two focus areas. The first
goal (Focused Area 1) is to conduct research that helps Veterans with mental health conditions, including pain,
improve their health and safety. This focus area includes research on suicide prevention, the use of
prescription opioids, and optimization of non-opioid pain care—these topics are also high priorities in VHA. The
second goal (Focused Area 2) is to conduct research that helps Veterans, their supports, and their clinicians
create and sustain effective healthcare relationships. Additional CIVIC goals are to 3) support additional high
value, innovative research that falls outside of our focused areas; 4) collaborate with a diverse set of
stakeholders including Veterans to enhance research and build bridges between innovation and evidence; 5)
further develop CIVIC expertise in dissemination and implementation; and 6) support career development of
promising junior and established investigators to build health services research capacity.
CIVIC's Operational Partners are the Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention; Office of Patient
Centered Care and Cultural Transformation; Pain Management; VISN-20; and VAPORHCS. Veteran
stakeholders provide ongoing feedback about CIVIC operations and directions through our Veteran
Engagement Group. Each of CIVIC’s 19 Core investigators is a faculty member of VAPORHCS’s primary
academic affiliate, Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU). CIVIC’s Director is Steven Dobscha MD, and
its Associate Director is Linda Ganzini MD, MPH. Guided by its Steering Committee (which includes
Operations partners, two Veterans, and representatives from OHSU and other Centers of Innovation) and
CIVIC’s Executive Committee, CIVIC will, over the next five years, capitalize on several areas of methodologic
and content expertise to achieve its strategic goals. These areas of strength include use of mixed-methods
research; acquisition and synthesis of information from multiple stakeholders; expertise in understanding
Veterans’ healthcare experiences; evidence synthesis; Veteran engagement in research; suicide prevention;
opioids, pain and substance use disorder; lung cancer; and the use of technology to enhance care. In addition
to conducting high value research within and outside of our Focused Areas, specific objectives include
enhancing collaborations and developing multisite projects with investigators at other VA facilities,
incorporating more implementation and dissemination objectives into our projects, maintaining a steady
pipeline of Career Development Awardees and Advanced Health Services Research Fellowship trainees, and
expanding the range of our Veteran engagement activities.
In summary, VHA priorities include partnering with Veterans to create personal, proactive strategies to improve
health and well-being, empowering Veterans by creating opportunities for Veteran decision-making, and
enhancing Veteran and family engagement in care and research. CIVIC findings and products will address

9664248,"The goal of the Durham Center of Innovation to Accelerate Discovery and Practice Transformation
(ADAPT) is to enhance the Veterans Health Administration’s (VHA) ability to continually improve health care
and optimize Veteran wellbeing and independence. We approach this goal by generating and applying
evidence to spur innovation in health care organization, finance, and delivery for Veterans and their families. In
its 35-year history, Durham’s Health Services Research and Development Center, now named ADAPT, has
conducted hundreds of policy-relevant studies influencing Veterans’ health care, trained 143 physician and
postdoctoral fellows, and supported 32 VA Career Development Awardees. Comprising a large group of
experienced investigators nested within a mature research infrastructure, ADAPT is ideally suited to continue
to provide scientific leadership across the continuum from basic health services to implementation research. In
this way, we will play a vital role in helping VHA meet the challenges of providing timely, coordinated,
consistently high-quality care to more than 9 million Veterans each year.
 While proud of our track record, we recognize that new methods and models are required to meet the ever-
changing needs of VHA and our Veterans, who experience a disproportionately high burden of disease related
to poor health behaviors and other clinical and social factors, face challenges to accessing health care, and
have greater need of long-term care services and supports than at any time in history. Based on a 1-year
planning process involving extensive input from VHA leadership and other stakeholders, and drawing from the
World Health Organization’s conceptual framework of resilient, or adaptive, health care systems, we have
selected 3 focused areas of research for the next 5 years that align with VA strategic priorities: (1) promoting
and sustaining healthy behaviors; (2) enhancing access through virtual care; and (3) optimizing function
and independence. We have formed investigator teams to focus on each priority area in close collaboration
with health system partners. Each team will support a portfolio of externally funded projects, catalyze new
ideas through pilot studies and grant development workshops, provide intellectual leadership in the larger
research community, and be a national resource to inform VA clinical care and policy decisions. To continue

research discoveries; 3) translating research findings into practice transformation throughout VHA; and 4)
training the next generation of researchers who will become leaders in VA research. ADAPT will amplify the
impact of our individual investigators and meaningfully enhance VHA’s ability to care for our nation’s Veterans."
11094679,"The goal of the Durham Center of Innovation to Accelerate Discovery and Practice Transformation
(ADAPT) is to enhance the Veterans Health Administration’s (VHA) ability to continually improve health care
and optimize Veteran wellbeing and independence. We approach this goal by generating and applying
evidence to spur innovation in health care organization, finance, and delivery for Veterans and their families. In
its 35-year history, Durham’s Health Services Research and Development Center, now named ADAPT, has
conducted hundreds of policy-relevant studies influencing Veterans’ health care, trained 143 physician and
postdoctoral fellows, and supported 32 VA Career Development Awardees. Comprising a large group of
experienced investigators nested within a mature research infrastructure, ADAPT is ideally suited to continue
to provide scientific leadership across the continuum from basic health services to implementation research. In
this way, we will play a vital role in helping VHA meet the challenges of providing timely, coordinated,
consistently high-quality care to more than 9 million Veterans each year.
 While proud of our track record, we recognize that new methods and models are required to meet the ever-
changing needs of VHA and our Veterans, who experience a disproportionately high burden of disease related
to poor health behaviors and other clinical and social factors, face challenges to accessing health care, and
have greater need of long-term care services and supports than at any time in history. Based on a 1-year
planning process involving extensive input from VHA leadership and other stakeholders, and drawing from the
World Health Organization’s conceptual framework of resilient, or adaptive, health care systems, we have
selected 3 focused areas of research for the next 5 years that align with VA strategic priorities: (1) promoting
and sustaining healthy behaviors; (2) enhancing access through virtual care; and (3) optimizing function
and independence. We have formed investigator teams to focus on each priority area in close collaboration
with health system partners. Each team will support a portfolio of externally funded projects, catalyze new
ideas through pilot studies and grant development workshops, provide intellectual leadership in the larger
research community, and be a national resource to inform VA clinical care and policy decisions. To continue
our longstanding commitment to training and career development, each research area will also attract and
support promising junior investigators and provide individual mentorship to foster their scientific development.

the Center for Healthcare Organization and Implementation Research – now has the scientists, the
environment, and the resources to respond and contribute to the challenges that Veterans' healthcare will
face in the years to come. CHOIR's MISSION is to conduct organizationally-partnered, and Veteran-
partnered research in order to develop, implement, and evaluate evidence-based and innovative practices
that improve VA healthcare. Our VISION is that CHOIR serve as a large, vibrant, multi-campus Center
which engages the healthcare- and university-rich environment of Greater Boston to enhance VA services
and contribute to health services research (HSR) nationally and internationally. Our PRIORITY GOALS
are: (1) to advance the field of HSR by sustaining, developing, and growing our existing, scientific focus
areas, and growing our evolving and emerging scientific areas; (2) to enrich VA's cadre of world-class HSR
investigators, by supporting training and education across the career spectrum; (3) to grow and support
innovation, to maintain VA at the cutting edge of HSR and adapt to meet VA's ever-changing needs.
 CHOIR's three main Scientific Focus Areas have developed from collaborations with key VA partners.
Enhancing Recovery-Oriented Care for Vulnerable Populations [Major Partners: Office of Mental
Health and Suicide Prevention, Center for Homelessness Among Veterans] seeks to understand and
implement models of care to develop Veterans' independence, particularly in those with behavioral
vulnerabilities such as mental health challenges, homelessness and involvement with the justice system.
Medication Management & Outcomes [Major Partner: Pharmacy Benefits Management] addresses best
practices for pharmaceutical use, including studies of the quality, safety, and value of prescribing and
studies to engage Veterans in medication decision-making and improve adherence. Healthcare
Communications [Major Partners: Office of Connected Care, Office of Patient-Centered Care & Cultural
Transformation] conducts research on communicating adverse events to patients, on communicating with
patients using connected care technologies, and on patient-centered communication and care
coordination. In addition to these, CHOIR's Evolving Scientific Areas, first germinated as new emerging
areas 5 years ago, are now mature: Long-Term Care is partnered with the VA Office of Geriatrics and
Extended Care and studies Community Living Centers, models of Geriatric primary care, and team-based
care for the elderly, and Patient Safety, partnered with the VA National Center for Patient Safety, improves
measurement of patient safety by facilitating standardization and integration across existing patient safety
measures, developing and testing new measures to improve on traditional approaches.
 CHOIR research has had major impacts on research and on VA systems of care. Just two out of many
examples are Dr. Elwy's work, which has changed how VA surgeons are taught to talk to their patients
about surgical adverse events; and Dr. Bokhour's development of metrics to assess the impact of the VA
Whole Health Initiative on patient reported outcomes.
 CHOIR's future success will be built upon a strong commitment to successful mentoring and career
development throughout the career trajectory from post-doctoral to senior investigator levels. Our
successful post-doctoral programs, our career development award (CDA) support program, and our post-
CDA transition mentoring are all integral to CHOIR's mission and are essential elements of the Center
moving forward. Important new Emerging Areas are the Veteran Engagement in Research initiative,
bringing Veterans into the research process as stakeholders, and the CHOIR Innovation Incubator, in
which we both study the process of diffusing innovation within VA and support innovative HSR&D projects."

 driven care, generate and disseminate knowledge that contributes to the well-being of Veterans, work
collaboratively with VA policy and operational leaders to implement research finding into clinical care, and train
 the next generation of health services research leaders.
In the next 5 years, we will continue to align our programs with challenges faced by patients, providers, and the
VA health system. We have 2 research focus areas with 3 objectives embedded within each:
1. Promote Veteran-centered care and improve the patient experience across VA healthcare and
 community settings. We will accomplish the following: 1) develop methods to incorporate patient reported
 outcomes into routine clinical care and test interventions to improve these outcomes, 2) improve patient
 adherence and self-management through interventions targeting patients, providers and health systems, 3)
innovate the delivery of specialty, mental, and/or primary health care services to patients using patient-
centered approaches that bridge socioeconomic and geographic disparities.
2. Advance value-driven care by providing Veterans the highest quality care at lowest financial burden. We
 will develop new approaches to care that: 1) help the VA efficiently utilize, integrate, and coordinate health
 services received within the VA and in the community, 2) improve the quality and safety of care through
 appropriate implementation and de-implementation of healthcare services and 3) identify methods to
 improve workforce development, deployment, and provider satisfaction and well-being.
Our emerging research areas include women's health, suicide prevention, and eliminating disparities. We have
led and will continue to lead Veteran engagement efforts in research for VA nationally.

9663062,"B. Abstract/Executive Summary: To create evidence and implement findings to support and guide the VA
in providing the best care in the right place at the right time. This is the vision for our Center of Innovation
(COIN), the Center of Innovation for Complex Chronic Healthcare (CINCCH). We define complex chronic
care to include Veterans with complex needs and life circumstances, and those who use multiple sources of
care (e.g., VA, Medicare, non-VA care). Our mission statement describes what we do each day: to conduct
research to improve coordination and contextualization of health care delivery, improve outcomes for
Veterans with high priority neurologic conditions, disseminate and implement evidence, and train future
researchers. We will advance care by using innovative methods including direct observation and engaging
Veterans and VA partners in research resulting in high quality, high value, Veteran-centric care.
CINCCH focus areas are aligned with two of VA Secretary David Shulkin's top five priorities; modernization
and efficiency. With respect to modernization, VA is committed to redefining the Veteran-centered model of
care and to reducing fragmentation and duplication of care. Our first research focus is to develop and
implement strategies to optimize contextualization and coordination of health care delivery for
Veterans. We address Veteran-centered care by emphasizing the need to tailor or contextualize care to
patient life circumstances, and reduce fragmentation and duplication through improved care coordination.
Our second area is to develop and implement best practices for Veterans with high priority
neurologic conditions. This aligns with the priority for efficiency including strengthening foundational
services in VA. VA provides world class care for 26% of persons with spinal cord injuries/disorders (SCI/D),
the largest integrated network for SCI/D in the U.S. CINCCH's research in SCI/D addresses respiratory
infections, pressure ulcers, bone health, weight management and increasing access with telehealth.
Frances Weaver, Ph.D., Research Career Scientist, has been the CINCCH Director for ten years and a
health services researcher for over 30 years. She has considerable experience in leadership, collaboration
partnership, and mentoring. Saul Weiner, M.D. is the Associate Director. He is an accomplished researcher
and clinician with strong partnerships with VA Operations.
CINCCH works with several Operations Partners including the SCI/D Program Office and the Veterans'
Integrated Service Network 12 (VISN12). Other Partners include the Office of Patient Centered Care &
Cultural Transformation (OPCC&CT), Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (PM&R), the National Kidney
Disease and Dialysis Program Office, the National Center for Homelessness, the Office of Care
Coordination, and the Pharmacy Benefits Management Services (PBM). We are affiliated with three
academic institutions: Loyola University of Chicago (LUC), Northwestern University (NU), and the University
of Illinois at Chicago (UIC); CINCCH investigators have faculty appointments at these institutions.
Recent accomplishments include: an 80% increase in HSR&D-funded investigators (from five to nine) in the
last funding cycle; and two national awards: the Charles C. Shepard Award from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) for a paper on antibiotic overprescribing co-authored by Dr. Katie Suda, and
the PROSE award for excellence for Dr. Weiner's book on contextualizing care. Further, CINCCH has

promoting research in additional areas. CCDOR's research is enabled by a management structure that
includes experienced and dedicated leaders and six Cores to facilitate Center functioning, training and
research. The CCDOR Evidence Synthesis and Implementation Cores are known nationally for their
methodological expertise and contributions to Veteran health care. CCDOR's Statistics and Data Management
Core not only enables CCDOR research but develops new methods and serves as a resource for operational
partners, informatics groups and researchers across VHA. The Veterans Engagement Core has expertise in
community engagement and Community Based Participatory Research and is using both Veteran Engagement
Studios and Veteran Advisory Panels to engage Veterans in CCDOR research. CCDOR has deep and strong
partnerships with VA Program Offices, including the Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, the
National Center for PTSD, and National Pain Management. These partnerships help to ensure the value and
impact of Center research. Therefore, CCDOR is well-equipped to achieve its strategic goals, undertake the
projects described in this proposal and thereby improve care delivery, Veteran engagement in health care, and
Veterans' health and functioning in their communities."
11095708,"The mission of the Center for Care Delivery and Outcomes Research (CCDOR) is to develop and evaluate
interventions and implementation strategies that improve health care delivery, Veteran engagement in
health care, and Veterans' health and functioning in their communities. CCDOR's vision is to elevate the
quality, consistency and equity of health care and outcomes for all Veterans through innovative health services
and implementation research. Building on 20 years of success, this application proposes the renewal of
CCDOR as a VA HSR&D Center of Innovation (COIN) at the Minneapolis VA Health Care System (MVAHCS).
The name of the Center has been modified to reflect the Center's strategic goals while preserving the CCDOR
acronym and identity recognition. Over the next 5 years, CCDOR's strategic plan focuses on 2 high priority
areas in which CCDOR's expertise and partnerships are exceptionally strong and where CCDOR is uniquely
positioned to make substantial and meaningful contributions to improving Veteran health and health care: (1)
Trauma Recovery, and (2) Chronic Pain and Opioid Harms Reduction. These priority areas are of critical
importance to Veterans and their families and are aligned with the VA priorities to enhance foundational
services, improve timeliness, and suicide prevention, as well as the Federal Pain Research Strategy.
CCDOR's strategic goals are:
1. Conduct research to improve health care, health care experience and outcomes among Veterans with
 posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other trauma-related disorders. (Priority 1)
2. Conduct research to reduce opioid-related harms and improve health and functional outcomes for Veterans
 with chronic pain. (Priority 2)
3. Support and conduct impactful and innovative health services research to discover and support delivery of
 evidence-based practices on cancer prevention and control, healthy aging, and other important topics
 outside CCDOR's 2 priority areas. (Additional Research)
4. Train health services researchers to conduct high impact, partner-oriented and implementation-focused
 research and to become leaders in VA and national health care. (Mentoring and Training)
CCDOR is a vibrant health services research center of 26 core investigators leading research in Trauma
Recovery (Priority 1) and Chronic Pain and Opioid Harms Reduction (Priority 2), as well as conducing and
promoting research in additional areas. CCDOR's research is enabled by a management structure that
includes experienced and dedicated leaders and six Cores to facilitate Center functioning, training and
research. The CCDOR Evidence Synthesis and Implementation Cores are known nationally for their
methodological expertise and contributions to Veteran health care. CCDOR's Statistics and Data Management
Core not only enables CCDOR research but develops new methods and serves as a resource for operational
partners, informatics groups and researchers across VHA. The Veterans Engagement Core has expertise in
community engagement and Community Based Participatory Research and is using both Veteran Engagement
Studios and Veteran Advisory Panels to engage Veterans in CCDOR research. CCDOR has deep and strong
partnerships with VA Program Offices, including the Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, the
National Center for PTSD, and National Pain Management. These partnerships help to ensure the value and
impact of Center research. Therefore, CCDOR is well-equipped to achieve its strategic goals, undertake the
projects described in this proposal and thereby improve care delivery, Veteran engagement in health care, and
Veterans' health and functioning in their communities."

mission is to optimize health and well-being of Veterans through innovative research to improve access to and
engagement in evidence-based care for mental health and substance use disorders and prevent suicide.
CeMHOR Strategic Goals are to: 1) Advance knowledge and address gaps in access to and engagement in
evidence-based care for mental health and substance use disorders (Focus Area 1); 2) Develop, test, and
implement suicide prevention strategies (Focus Area 2); 3) Advance innovative research outside of focus
areas; 4) Strengthen strategic partnerships and collaborations with other centers and investigators to address
VA priorities; 5) Provide training, mentoring, and career development in mental health services research and
implementation science; and 6) Engage Veterans and other stakeholders in CeMHOR research. Key
CeMHOR, based at the Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System, partners include the Office of Mental
Health and Suicide Prevention, the Primary Care-Mental Health Integration Initiative, the Office of Rural Health,
the VISN 16 Mental Health Product Line, the Behavioral Health QUERI, the South Central MIRECC, and the
University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. Dr. Richard Owen, a psychiatrist, has been the Director of
CeMHOR for 19 years; Dr. Teresa Hudson, a health services researcher and pharmacist, has been associate
director for 11 years. CeMHOR investigators possess a diverse background including psychiatrists,
psychologists, pharmacists, social workers, anthropologists, a demographer, a medical sociologist, and an
epidemiologist; their passion for improved care for Veterans unites them to investigate the most effective and
impactful methods of advancing health services research and implementing improved care for all Veterans.
CeMHOR has two primary focus areas: 1) improving access to and engagement in evidence-based care for
Veterans with mental health and substance use disorders; and 2) suicide prevention. These are top priorities
for VA, the Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, and HSR&D. Research outside these focus areas
includes: 1) research to decrease risks of opioid misuse/abuse and increase treatment of opioid use disorders;
and 2) additional implementation science research. All CeMHOR research is planned, designed, and
conducted with widespread implementation in mind. CeMHOR expertise in rural health and community
engagement and our location in a largely rural VISN also informs our work.
CeMHOR investigators have pioneered development, testing, and implementation of interventions to improve
access to and engagement mental health care, with an emphasis on improving access and care for rural
Veterans. Multiple studies demonstrated the effectiveness of virtual care management for mental disorders,
enabling rural Veterans to receive evidence-based mental health treatments in Community Based Outpatient
Clinics (CBOCs). These care models have been implemented widely in VA settings and translated by
CeMHOR investigators to Federally-Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), which also serve Veterans in rural
areas. CeMHOR investigators have also worked in community settings to improve access, forming
relationships with community clergy and other local leaders, community colleges, and counselors to increase
awareness of VA and community mental health prevention and treatment resources for Veterans. Suicide
prevention is a relatively new focus of CeMHOR research; nevertheless, CeMHOR investigators have
substantial expertise in this area, as well as strong relationships with operational partners and researchers at
other centers. Investigators are studying implementation of Caring Contacts, an evidence-based suicide
prevention strategy, and leading evaluation of two high-priority initiatives: implementation of REACH VET; a
national suicide prevention effort; and the peer support/community outreach pilot program mandated in the
Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans (SAV) Act."

9666360,"As the VA pivots toward a dual role as both payor and provider, we must ensure access to high quality
care for Veterans wherever they receive it, while wisely using taxpayer resources. Value theory unites these
health outcomes with costs in a ratio that we can measure in health services research. The mission of the
Center for Innovation to Implementation (Ci2i) is to foster high-value health care for Veterans. We will do so
by identifying opportunities to improve value, and by testing the implementation of innovations that respond
to those opportunities, both crucial activities for any learning health care system. Organized around three foci
(C.1.a.), our research addresses priority areas for HSR&D and the VA leadership (C.Table 1).
 1) Fostering high-value mental health care: Ci2i has a 40-year history of conducting groundbreaking,
policy-relevant mental health services research. Mental health disorders rank among the most common and
costly conditions afflicting Veterans.1 In partnership with the Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention,
we will identify opportunities for innovation in improving access, quality, and resource use in mental health
care delivery, particularly for Veterans struggling with substance use disorders (SUD) and/or post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) (C.1.a.1.).
 2) Fostering high-value medical and surgical specialty care: Specialists comprise 65% of the physician
workforce,5 their decisions necessarily contribute substantially to increasing costs.6 Specialty care resources are
frequently misallocated, with some patients struggling for access while others are over-treated.7 It is imperative
to understand how and where costly medical and surgical specialty care creates the most value. Likewise, it is
imperative to create new approaches ensuring their optimal and judicious use.7,8 Ci2i will identify opportunities
and test innovations that ensure the right Veterans get the right specialty services at the right time (C.1.a.2.).
 3) Fostering high-value care beyond the VA: Many of the unrealized opportunities to improve Veteran
health lie outside the bricks and mortar VA delivery system. While the VA's increasing role as a purchaser of
community services aspires to expand access, it also poses new challenges in coordination and quality
monitoring. High-risk Veterans with complex clinical and social needs require support not only during
clinician visits, but also through daily caregiving and social services. Our research has shown the VA to
outperform the community in some aspects of care. We will help to establish methods for wise resource
allocation and extending high performance patient-centered care beyond VA walls to community providers and
Veterans' homes (C.1.a.3.).
 Ci2i is a large and thriving center supporting a broad portfolio of research even beyond these three
focus areas. We have published 1100 articles in the last three years and have been cited 184,000 times. Our
senior researchers have been honored with national VA awards in impact (Harris) and mentorship (Asch,
Frayne), and have advised state, federal, and international policymakers. Methodological core strengths
include health economics, decision analytics, and implementation science. Our long-term, successful
partnerships with national VA policy offices and regional delivery system leaders, as well as our Ci2i-based
QUERI centers, greatly aid our implementation efforts. Our Steering Committee, led by former Undersecretary
Dr. Ken Kizer, and an active Veterans Engagement Council, guide us in managing this process (C.5. E.1.).
Stanford, 0ur academic affiliate, and surrounding Silicon Valley provide a fertile environment for innovation.
 We are proud of these successes. But if VA is to continue to attract and serve Veterans in an era of fiscal
constraint and increased Veteran choice,9 it must continue its journey toward becoming the learning delivery
system that the National Academy of Medicine has posed as its vision for the future.10 Ci2i has the health
services researchers, operational connections, and history of success needed to achieve this ideal.11"
10818439,"Rapid technological developments and the increasingly wired and connected world have expanded our
ability to measure the external environment, human biology, and their interaction to generate a rich and
nuanced picture of environmental exposures of people and place. The future of environmental health will be
one of complex integration across a varied and rich exposure space. With this in mind, the theme of the
Harvard Chan School-NIEHS Center is a re-envisioning of the exposure environment and the integrated effects
of chemical and non-chemical stressors of people and place to better understand the impact of exposure on
human health. Our theme will build on a unique and defining strength of the Harvard Chan School-NIEHS
Center for Environmental Health; our unmatched portfolio of population and patient studies of environmental
exposures and their health effects. These studies of the real-world environmental exposures of human subjects
ensure that Center research can readily translate into public health policy and clinical practice. These
population-based investigations combine with mechanistic laboratory studies to illuminate how the complex,
real world lived environment acts to affect health. The Center will continue to foster integration across
population and biological mechanism studies, and will also specifically develop and apply the best available
technologies and methods to examine the complexity of exposures in the lived environment. Our Community
Engagement Core (CEC) supports the Center’s goal to re-envision the environment, serving as a conduit for
the local community to help researchers better envision the real world lived environmental exposure space,
and to translate Center research into public policy and clinical practice efforts to benefit the community.
 To facilitate interaction, the Center is organized around three Research Cores representing major
cross-cutting environmental health exposures: Particulate Matter and Other Air Pollutants, Metals, and Organic
chemicals. Each of the Research Cores has a track record of productivity, potential for continued growth, and
the ability to integrate and catalyze leadership in the future. Each Research Core is multidisciplinary and
deploys the full range of our intellectual resources and features toxicology, basic mechanisms, in vitro models,
animal models, gene-environment interactions, epidemiology, risk analysis, and risk communication. The
Research Cores are supported by the Integrated Health Sciences Facility Core that provides access to cutting
edge laboratory and exposure science resources; the Environmental Statistics and Bioinformatics Core that
provides cutting edge statistical resources including development of methods to analyze the kind of complex
mixtures that are found in the integrated exposure and outcome space we are focusing on; and the new
Geographical and Contextual Measures Core that will provide both guidance and tools to conceptualize and
measure the broad environmental landscape. The CEC provides a community context for the research and
integrated sciences occurring within the Center and engages closely with our research and facility cores."

Project Summary
The development post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) to modulate GVHD is a prime example of our
group’s successful translational research. Not only does PTCy allow safe haploidentical (haplo) blood or
marrow (BMT) in patients up to at least age 75, but the outcomes of haplo BMT with PTCy, confirmed by now
many international as well as registry studies, appear similar to those seen with matched donors. Our group
has also shown that PTCy also allows the application of safe and effective mismatched unrelated donor BMT.
The reduction in GVHD complications associated with PTCy has lowered the non-relapse mortality (NRM) to
less than 10% even in the mismatched setting, removing one of the major hurdles to successful allogeneic
(allo) BMT, donor availability. PTCy has helped open up alloBMT to virtually anyone in need. With the reduction
in NRM, relapse has become by far the major complication of alloBMT. Emerging data suggest that a new non-
tolerant and non-exhausted transplanted immune system has the ability to augment the activity of most
anticancer agents, small molecule as well as immunologic. Thus, the major objective of this proposal is to
study maintenance therapy after alloBMT as a means to reduce relapse. In fact, our data, as well as from other
groups, already appear promising with such an approach, perhaps best exemplified by the impressive results
seen in FLT3/ITD AML with alloBMT and post-transplant FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors despite many of these
agents showing limited activity in the non-transplant setting. There are also emerging data suggesting that
other agents generally lacking curative activity as single agents, such as rituximab in lymphomas, TKIs in Ph+
leukemias, and azaciditine for acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrom may demonstrate curative
activity in the post-alloBMT setting. The minimal residual disease state post-alloBMT should also optimize
novel antitumor approaches, in that they will be utilized at lowest tumor burden as well as tumor heterogeneity.
This new proposal will build on our work demonstrating that the post alloBMT setting provides a unique
environment for decreasing relapse after alloBMT. In addition, the now near universal availability of the
procedure, enabled by the favorable safety and cost profile associated with PTCy, opens up examining BMT
for unique applications. The overall goals/specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) investigate the ability of post-
transplant maintenance therapy to decrease relapse after BMT, 2) study alloBMT as a platform for enhancing
novel therapies for solid tumors, and 3) study whether alloBMT with PTCy can eliminate HIV."

 This application continues funding for “The National Dental PBRN”, a national collaborative of practices and
organizations across the United States that engages practitioners in the excitement of discovery for the benefit
of everyday clinical practice and patients. Consistent with specifications in the FOA itself, the Specific Aims will
be to: (1) maximize efficiencies to conduct national oral health research studies in general and specialty dental
practices on topics of importance to practitioners and their patients; (2) provide evidence useful in daily patient
care; (3) facilitate the translation of research findings into clinical practice; (4) continue our work during the
2005-2019 funding period to demonstrate consistent growth and productivity by streamlining the
implementation of clinical research across the network, facilitating practitioner and patient recruitment and
retention, and developing public-private partnerships (to develop projects of interest to specific dental groups
and specialties, practice types, special populations, and patient advocacy groups).
 The National Dental PBRN will accomplish these aims by building upon the many lessons learned from its
highly-productive current national network. We aim to build on our experiences from these past 13 years using
the same funding mechanism and administrative structure mandated in the FOA. The effectiveness of this
structure is evident from our network's high level of productivity, as judged by number of publications and
completed studies, the size, scope, quality, and diversity of studies, and impact on health and daily clinical
practice. The network will comprise six regional nodes, one specialty node, a central administrative core based
at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), and a central Coordinating Center. Other key elements of
the governing and administrative structure will include an Executive Committee, Node Directors Committee,
Steering Committee, Node Coordinators Committee, Director of Communications & Dissemination, Director of
Practitioner Recruitment & Engagement, Practitioner Training Component, Practitioner & Patient
Compensation System, Publications & Presentations Committee, Central IRB, Data & Safety Monitoring Board,
and NIDCR staff. Nodes will be based at Health Partners Institute (Minneapolis, MN); Kaiser Permanente
(Portland, OR); UAB (Birmingham, AL); University of Florida (Gainesville, FL); University of Illinois (Chicago,
IL); University of Rochester (Rochester, NY); and the University of Texas Health Science Center (San Antonio,

10209963,"One of the key challenges in suicidality research is that outcomes may be multi-determined and rare. The
causes of suicidal behaviors may consist of a combination of factors, which vary over time, and between
individuals and groups. Risk factors may be distal or proximal, and distal exposures may increase risk for
suicide given changes in proximal risk factor(s). Despite literature on suicidality among lesbian, gay, bisexual,
and transgender (LGBT) persons, little research has examined LGBT Veterans. We hypothesize that LGBT
status is a pre-disposing factor that increases risk due to minority stress, the stress of prior and potentially
ongoing discrimination, including military sexual trauma, that may be further increased due to proximal factors
such as comorbid mental health and medical conditions, a lack of engagement in care, system and providers
lack of awareness or insensitivity to their unique needs, and pain among other factors. With the 2011 repeal of
the Don't Ask, Don't Tell (DADT) policy, LGB personnel are currently able to openly serve in the US military,
while the status of T personnel remains uncertain. While LGBT Veterans, especially those who served prior to
repeal of DADT, may suffer similar discrimination, stigma and stress, they may each have dissimilar suicide
risks. One study in the VA found that the prevalence of gender identity disorder diagnosis was >5 times higher
than in the general US population, and that the rate of suicide-related events was > 20 times higher than the
VA population. However, the engagement of LGBT Veterans in VA care is difficult to estimate: sexual
orientation and gender identity (SO/GI) data is not collected in a structured manner. The VA's Evidence
Review: Social Determinants of Health for Veterans found “only two articles examined sexual orientation for
Veterans and non-Veterans and included only women. No articles addressed gender identity for Veterans and
non-Veterans”. In addition to LGBT status, there is less study of other suicide risk factors such as pain and
opioid prescriptions as well as potential protective factors such as receipt of complementary and integrative
health services, which may treat both pain and PTSD. Little is known about how race/ethnicity, gender,
morbidity, and treatment intersect with sexual orientation/gender identity to impact suicidality risk. Using VA
electronic health record data, will identify LGBT Veterans to ascertain pathways to suicidal behavior, and
assess both risk and protective factors related to LGBT individuals in all gender, age, and racial and ethnic
groups. In a current project (IIR 16-262), our team is developing natural language processing (NLP) and
machine learning (ML) tools to study CIH services' effect on opioid prescribing among Veterans with
musculoskeletal disorder diagnoses (MSD) and PTSD. In another project (CRE 12-012), we identified 15,000+
Veterans with suicide attempts near the MSD diagnosis date, and 17,000+ suicide deaths in the cohort (N=5.2
million). That work informs this proposal. Because suicide attempts (SA) might not be captured if a Veteran
presents at a non-VA hospital, we will integrate CMS data and develop NLP and ML tools to extract information
from VA clinical notes as part of care. The objective and aims of this study are to: Aim 1: Develop informatics
tools to identify LGBT Veterans and suicide attempts and events. Aim 2: Characterize suicide risk factors in a
national sample of veterans. Aim 3: Examine the differential effect of risk factors on suicide by LGBT status.
Achievement of these objectives and Specific Aims promise to expand our understanding of potential areas of
unmet need and outreach to all individuals at risk for suicide. This area of VA health services research is in its
infancy. Next steps will include: examinations of service(s) use after policy changes and VHA directives such
as repeal of DADT (2010) and DOMA (2013), and VHA Directives 1340 and 2011-024 as noted in the letter of
support from the VA's LGBT Health Program (10P4Y); using SHEP data to examine differences in satisfaction
with care; and sorely needed data on differences in outcomes of care for LGBT Veterans."
11044583,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposal is a large multi-site site randomized controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of the newly FDA-
approved extended-release buprenorphine formulation (XR-B, SUBLOCADETM) vs. extended-release naltrexone
(XR-NTX) among currently incarcerated adult volunteers with moderate-to-severe opioid use disorders (OUD)
with an upcoming release date. XR-B may be an effective CJS intervention alongside other OUD medications
and may ultimately allow for much wider uptake of opioid agonist medication treatments in CJS populations.
High quality effectiveness data for XR-B in CJS is urgently needed.
The Multiple PI and Academic CJS partners participating in this consortium will recruit participants from 5 distinct
CJS trial sites including: (1) NYU School of Medicine/NYC DOC jail system, (2) Yale/Connecticut DOC, (3)
Dartmouth/New Hampshire DOC, (4) Oregon Health & Science University-UCLA/Multnomah County, and (5)
Friends Research Institute/Delaware DOC. The PIs and DOC Co-Investigators or collaborators are deeply
experienced in working with CJS opioid patient populations and leading high-quality and collaborative NIH clinical
trials focused on opioid medication treatments. Trial sites vary considerably, from unified statewide prison/jail
systems (CT, DE, NH) to large urban municipal jails (NYC, Portland OR), and with diverse experience with opioid
medications as usual care, including methadone (NYC, CT, Portland), SL-B (NYC, CT, DE, Portland), and small
XR-NTX pilots (all sites). All of these locations and CJS authorities face unprecedented pressure to contribute
CJS-opioid solutions and help reverse the historically high rates of opioid overdose deaths, particularly following
release from corrections.
A 5-site, open-label, non-inferiority, head-to-head design will randomly assign 666 adult volunteers soon-to-be-
released with moderate-to-severe opioid use disorders (OUD) 1:1 to XR-B or XR-NTX in corrections followed by
24-weeks of post-release community treatment, and final long-term follow-up at 12-months. An additional 334
OUD individuals otherwise eligible but not interested in the RCT will be recruited into a quasi-experimental
treatment-as-usual 3rd study arm (TAU), for a total recruited sample of N=1,000. Participants will be referred to
appropriate community treatment options at Week 24. Final follow-up will occur at Week 52. The primary
outcome is retention-in-study medication-treatment during Weeks 1-24 (6 scheduled monthly injections), using
a non-inferiority comparison. Secondary outcomes will compare opioid treatment outcomes (e.g. opioid-positive
urine samples and self-reported opioid use, other drug/alcohol use, safety events, and HCV, HIV
seroconversion). A 3rd non-randomized, quasi-experimental arm of OUD individual (n=334) otherwise eligible but
not enrolling in the RCT will allow comparisons with treatment-as-usual (TAU) across the 5 sites."
10875705,"The complex interaction between Alzheimer drivers and aging
Project Summary/Abstract (30 lines of text)
The greatest risk for Alzheimer’s disease is age. This extremely tight correlation with age has
no explanation. However, most of what know about Alzheimer’s comes from early onset cases.
We will utilize the 100 cases of early onset AD stored in the Colombian brain bank all with the
same PSEN1[E280A] mutation to determine the full range of pathology observed due to a
monogenic defect and compare these data to sporadic older onset disease. Some of the
Colombian individuals in the bank have had amyloid and tau PET studies. In sporadic disease
among the elderly, brain changes related to aging are frequent and in the absence of their
clear delineation, treatments targeted solely at dominant genetic forms of the disease may be
ineffective. Factors which might distinguish and promote AD in the elderly include inflammation,
compromised brain vasculature, excessive microgliosis, cellular aging such as break down of
the nuclear membrane and consequently escape of TDP-43 from the nucleus and possible
contributions of synuclein. We will explore interactions of these factors with aging through
descriptive neuropathology and experimental neuropathology methods. Comparisons will utilize
sporadic AD post-mortem from several brain banks. These studies include state of the art
single cell RNAseq and advanced assessment of inflammation markers. Cellular models will be
explored using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons that harbor the
PSEN1[E280A] mutation and are intended to discover downstream pathways affected by the
mutation. Co-cultures with microglia to capture autonomous and non-autonomous effects of the
mutation will be determined.
To accomplish the aims we have assembled a multi-institutional international team with a long
history of collaboration. Dr. Lopera, who first recognized the families and manages the
Alzheimer Prevention Trial, heads the team in Colombia, an NIH supported project. To support
the neuropathology effort we have enlisted the expertise of Dr. Eric Huang. Kosik has a nearly
30 year collaboration with Lopera, is familiar with the conduct of research in Colombia and
recently traveled to visit the Colombian brain bank with Eric Huang. Kosik is closely connected
institutionally with UCSF through his role as co-director of the Tau Consortium along with Bruce
Miller. Kosik has published with Ellisman and serves on the review board for the National
Center for Microscopy and Imaging Research center at UCSD. Thus the project consists of a
strong, experienced and highly integrated team capable of conducting a complex project and
dealing with any of the obstacles that will inevitably arise."
10829353,"Project Summary
We propose to establish a “Center for Male Reproductive Epigenomics” (herein called the “Center”) in
response to the NICHD RFA-HD-19-017. The Center aims to study three key aspects of intergenerational
epigenetic inheritance of environmentally-induced epimutations: 1) the impact of lifestyle (diet/activity) on
the integrity of the sperm epigenome, 2) the molecular mechanisms underlying transmission of lifestyle-
induced sperm epimutations to offspring, and 3) the mechanisms by which inherited epimutations can
predispose disease states in offspring. By studying the sperm epigenome of male mice maintained on
either a high fat diet without exercise or a normal diet + exercise, or transitioned from the former to the
latter, in parallel with that of obese, inactive men maintaining an unhealthy lifestyle or transitioned to a
healthy diet + exercise lifestyle, we will test our central hypothesis, i.e., paternal epigenetic inheritance of
lifestyle-induced metabolic disorders is achieved through a combinatorial molecular mechanism involving
sncRNAs, DNA methylation and histone modifications, which relay epimutations from somatic cells to
sperm and from a father’s sperm to his offspring where they predispose development of disease-related
traits. Our studies in men (Project 1) will establish the extent of the deleterious effects of an unhealthy
lifestyle (high fat/caloric diet and physical inactivity) on the human sperm epigenome and will determine
whether the incidence of these epimutations can be reduced if an obese/inactive man adopts a healthy
lifestyle (low fat/caloric diet + exercise). Our studies in mice (Projects 2 and 3) will reveal the mechanisms
by which an unhealthy lifestyle leads to formation of epimutations in spermatozoa that are subsequently
transmitted to, propagated within, and deleterious to male offspring – based on mechanistic studies that
cannot be done in men. In the short term, our studies will elucidate the underlying mechanisms by which
an unhealthy lifestyle in men can predispose development of unhealthy phenotypes or disease in their
offspring and the extent to which transition from an obese/inactive lifestyle to a healthy diet + exercise
lifestyle can mitigate these effects. In the long term, a thorough understanding of how lifestyle-induced
epimutations initially occur and are transmitted from a father to his sons (= intergenerational epigenetic
inheritance) will form the basis for future investigations into mechanisms underlying the subsequent
transmission of lifestyle-induced epimutations to multiple subsequent generations (= transgenerational
epigenetic inheritance)."

 Dysfunction and death of neurons severely affect the quality of life, yet therapeutic options remain
limited. Recent studies demonstrated clinic potential to replace lost neurons, e.g., transplanting of hESC-
derived retinal cells improves disrupted visual acuity. However, research progress is hindered by limited
mechanistic understanding of how to program cells into mature states for proper neurite outgrowth. Neurons
undergo dramatic remodeling during development to become fully mature. This conserved process consists of
precisely regulated pruning and outgrowth of neurites, facilitated by accurate transcriptome dynamics. How
chromatin is organized to achieve the dynamic transcriptome during this process remains undefined. My long-
term goal is to study epigenetic mechanisms underlying neuronal maturation and promote their application
toward studies with clinic potential to improve life quality. This proposed project uses both Drosophila and
mouse as model systems to study insulator regulation of 3D chromatin organization during neuronal outgrowth.
CTCF is a conserved insulator protein that plays a central role in 3D chromatin organization. Shep is a
conserved RNA/DNA-binding protein that is essential for proper neuronal outgrowth. My preliminary data
indicate that Shep antagonizes CTCF insulator to promote neuronal outgrowth of fly. Here I am proposing
three aims to investigate epigenetic mechanisms underlying my preliminary findings: 1) Determine neuron-
specific Shep regulation of 3D chromatin organization at its target loci in fly. 2) Investigate neuron-specific
mechanisms by which Shep antagonizes CTCF insulator function in fly. 3) Elucidate Shep and CTCF function
in regulating morphological and physiological maturation of mouse neurons. This project will employ extensive
neuron-specific high throughput sequencing coupled with physiological assays to reveal molecular
mechanisms underlying neuronal remodeling in both fly and mouse. These data will provide novel insights into
epigenetic regulation of neuronal maturation and suggest compelling mechanisms for studies with medical and
clinic potential. My career goal is to create my independent research group, employing fly as an efficient tool to
reveal mechanisms that are subsequently tested in the mouse model. My mentor Dr. Elissa Lei's group has
long been studying insulator-mediated chromatin organization and gene expression. I will get extensive training
in epigenetics, including scientific knowledge and technical skills to generate sequencing libraries in the Lei
group. My co-mentor Dr. Jeff Diamond will provide essential training on mouse neuroscience and physiology.
My second co-mentor Dr. Victor Corces will provide both scientific advice on epigenetic studies and guidance
on career development once I establish my lab at a university. The K99/R00 award will assist me to achieve
my goals by providing essential resource and funding at my mentored-stage and my early independent phase."

10889898,"ABSTRACT – ARTFL LEFFTDS Longitudinal FTLD: OVERALL SECTION
Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD) is the overarching term for a group of neurodegenerative disorders
that are believed to be caused by the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates in the CNS, most commonly
comprised of one of two major proteins–microtubule associated protein tau and TAR DNA binding protein
molecular weight 43 kDa. FTLD is at least as common as Alzheimer's disease (AD) in those under the age of
65. Due to the earlier age of onset and the rapid rate of decline, FTLD is thought to have an even greater
impact on the lives of patients and families when compared to AD. At least 20% of all FTLD patients have a
dominantly inherited familial disorder (f-FTLD), whereas the remaining patients have a sporadic FTLD
syndrome (s-FTLD). The current Advancing Research and Treatment in Frontotemporal Degeneration (ARTFL;
U54 NS092089) study enrolls and follows these s-FTLD patients. Approximately 50% of f-FTLD is the result of
one of three common mutations: the microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT), progranulin (GRN), or
chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) genes. The current Longitudinal Evaluation of Familial
Frontotemporal Dementia Subjects (LEFFTDS; U01 AG045390) study enrolls and follows participants with a
known family mutation, while ARTFL also enrolls those with strong family histories but no known mutation. The
ARTFL LEFFTDS Longitudinal Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (ALLFTD) protocol represents our
plan to formalize the merger of the ARTFL and LEFFTDS studies to create an integrated North American
research consortium to study FTLD. The ALLFTD program, as implemented through this U19 mechanism, will
improve our infrastructure for comprehensive collection and sharing of data through creation of seven cores.
We address the main goals recommended by the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) Steering Committee
on the Alzheimer's Disease-Related Dementias (ADRD) focused on FTLD through these cores and two
research projects. ALLFTD will support many additional projects that address both the clinical and
neuroscientific goals recommended by NAPA ADRD by providing clinical data, scans and biological samples to
the scientific community. While there are no effective treatments for any FTLD disorder, increasing numbers of
new potential therapies are entering clinical trials. The ALLFTD program's commitment to supporting data
collection and sharing with researchers worldwide will foster development of disease-modifying therapies for
FTLD."

There is no shortage of innovative ideas for behavioral interventions to improve health care delivery in the
United States. Health care delivery reform has the potential to dramatically improve the health and health care
experience. This is especially true for the aging population who interact with the health care system more
frequently and suffer some of the gravest health problems. However, too little is known about which
interventions could be effective for improving the health of these individuals. This proposal seeks to identify,
fund, and support low-cost, high-impact Stage I trials of behavioral interventions for mid-life and older people.
The Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL), founded in 2003, is a network of more than 165 affiliated
professors at over 55 universities, united by their use of randomized evaluations to answer critical policy
questions. J-PAL North America (NA) was launched at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in
2013 by Amy Finkelstein (MIT) and Lawrence Katz (Harvard) to apply the J-PAL approach to the region. J-PAL
NA’s Health Care Delivery Initiative (HCDI) focuses on catalyzing high-quality randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) to test how best to improve health care delivery. We propose to leverage this foundation to spur and
support early-stage RCTs to test behavioral interventions to improve health care delivery and health outcomes
for older adults. The MIT Roybal Center will support two Stage I pilots in its first year, and will select additional
pilot projects in Years 2-5 through a rigorous peer review process. Our proposed Year 1 projects are:
Project 1: Deferring Agency at End-of-Life: The Role of Information and Advance Directives. This project
focuses on policies related to medical care and decision-making at end-of-life, a topic that is broadly relevant to
the aging population.
Project 2: Post-Acute Pain Management for Opioid-Tolerant Patients: A Randomized Controlled Trial. This
project seeks to provide rigorous evidence on how to effectively manage pain in patients who are already on
high doses of opioids and thus at risk of a host of negative outcomes, including overdose.
Each of these projects will be supported by (i) the Management and Administrative Core, which will provide
overall leadership and coordination for the Center and (ii) the Pilot Core. The Pilot Core will support project
development activities to identify promising Stage I research projects, coordinate selection of the most
promising pilots for funding, support funded pilots, and create a sustained behavioral intervention development
program to improve health outcomes for older adults."
10922756,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among men in the United States, with an anticipated
164,690 men being diagnosed in 2018. It is also one of the leading causes of cancer death, with approximately
29,430 deaths anticipated in 2018, usually as a result of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer
(mCRPC). Pathogenic variants in DNA damage repair (DDR) pathway genes are prevalent in a substantial
subset of men who develop mCRPC. These germline or somatic genetic abnormalities, primarily insertions and
deletions resulting in protein truncations that interfere with DDR, occur in 20-25% of men with mCRPC. While
several studies are underway to leverage these findings for men at the latest stages of prostate cancer, genetic
variation in the DDR pathway has not yet been fully characterized for men with localized prostate cancer. While
there is increasing evidence that some DDR gene aberrations may be associated with aggressive prostate
cancer, this also has not been fully characterized. In the United States, where prostate cancer screening is
common, over 90% of patients present initially with localized disease. It is at this point in the natural history of
the disease when intervention can have the most profound impact. Thus, a major focus of this proposal is
understanding the spectrum of DDR gene aberrations that promote aggressive cancers, particularly in men
with high-risk localized and oligometastatic disease.
Retrospective series demonstrate that DDR variants occur with low frequency in men with low-risk prostate
cancer and with higher frequency in men with high-risk localized prostate cancer. This has wide-ranging clinical
implications. For instance, mutational status could be used to identify those at highest risk of developing lethal
prostate cancer, and therapy could be optimized based on tumor or germline findings. In addition, targeted
screening could be implemented to identify those at highest risk of aggressive disease and provide an
opportunity for early intervention.
The overarching goal of this program is to increase our understanding of the spectrum of DDR gene
aberrations that are associated with adverse outcomes in high-risk localized and oligometastatic prostate
cancer. This will allow us to optimize the therapeutic approach to patients who have DDR aberrations, to detect
and treat lethal disease early, and to improve outcomes for patients and their relatives who carry germline
aberrations. In order to achieve our goal, we have assembled a multi-institutional and multidisciplinary group of
investigators, including clinical investigators, epidemiologists, statisticians, pathologists, clinical geneticists,
computational biologists, bioinformaticians, and basic scientists. Our specific aims are to determine the
association between long-term clinical outcome and pathogenic germline and somatic variants in DDR genes
across different ethnic groups, to develop treatment strategies for patients with germline or somatic alterations
in DDR pathways, and to evaluate the functional significance of different alterations in DDR genes."

Human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers are major causes of morbidity and mortality in the Latin
American and Caribbean region. Beyond universal HPV vaccination programs, cost-effective strategies are
needed to enhance early detection and improve non-invasive management of precancerous lesions among
HIV-positive women and men. Little is known about the performance of newer screening technologies in HIV-
positive women in Latin America. The California-Mexico-Puerto Rico (CAMPO) Consortium will perform
three clinical research studies focused on the prevention of cervical cancer among HIV-positive women in
Mexico and Puerto Rico. Study 1 will examine new screening algorithms for cervical high-grade squamous
intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) in 4000 HIV-positive women in Mexico and Puerto Rico. This study will evaluate
triage strategies that include liquid-based cytology, point-of-care genotyping for high-risk HPV DNA, E6/7
oncoprotein expression, and viral and host methylation to detect cervical HSIL among HIV-positive women. We
hypothesize that a test with high sensitivity, followed by a test with high specificity, will provide for optimal
sensitivity, specificity and predictive value for cervical HSIL in this population. We will also screen 1000 HIV-
positive men who have sex with men (MSM) for anal HSIL to identify men with anal HSIL for our HSIL
treatment studies (Studies 2 and 3) and evaluate anal HSIL screening algorithms using the same tests as
those being done in the cervix. Through the cases of cervical and anal HSIL identified in these screening
studies, the CAMPO Consortium will also develop and implement two randomized placebo-controlled
treatment studies for HSIL. Study 2 will evaluate the impact of anogenital probiotic use on anal and cervical
microbiota profiles and the relationship to anal and cervical HSIL regression in 600 HIV-positive women and
men as well as reduction of high-risk HPV DNA persistence among those with no lesions. Study 3 will evaluate
the safety and efficacy of a multivalent replication-defective adenovirus-based therapeutic HPV vaccine to treat
cervical and anal HSIL in 300 HIV-positive women and men and identify immune response correlates of HSIL
regression. Together, the proposed studies aim to develop novel strategies for cervical and anal cancer
prevention for HIV-positive adults. The CAMPO Consortium will include three Cores to support the
implementation of the Clinical Trials Program: (1) a Central Laboratory Core; (2) a Data Management and
Statistical Core; and (3) an Administrative and Coordinating Core. Furthermore, investigators within the
CAMPO Consortium will provide mentorship to support early career investigators from Mexico and Puerto
Rico, fostering the next generation of cancer researchers focused on HPV-related cancers and HIV with the
region. Through its unique combination of innovative science with research capacity-building and mentorship,
we expect the CAMPO Consortium to have a substantial impact on cervical and anal cancer prevention efforts
in the Latin American and Caribbean region."

10915693,"PROJECT SUMMARY – OVERALL
Worldwide, cervical cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer incidence and mortality; 80% of cervical
cancers arise and 87% of cervical cancer deaths occur in low and lower-middle income countries. In Peru,
cervical cancer is diagnosed at a rate of 17 per 100,000 women per year, and in the DR at 23 per 100,000
annually among women in the general population. The burden of cervical cancer is substantially increased
among women living with HIV (WLWH), although the exact rates are not well described. Although HPV
vaccines are safe and effective as primary prevention, they have limited availability in low resource settings
and the optimal regimen of vaccine doses for HIV-infected persons in such settings has not been defined.
Furthermore, delivery of cervical cancer prevention and treatment of precursors for WLWH in low- and middle-
income countries is impeded by approaches that are often costly, require multiple visits and extensive provider
training. Moreover, many of these are not suitable for delivery within an HIV primary care model.
The Cervical Cancer Prevention Partnership (C2P2) Center involves two clinical trial sites, in Peru and the
Dominican Republic, and three cores (Administrative and Coordinating Core, Statistics and Data Management
Core and Central Laboratory Core) in Seattle. Investigators in the C2P2 Center will jointly design, conduct and
analyze three clinical trials with the goal of moving toward elimination of cervical cancer among highly
vulnerable populations with HIV in low resource settings in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). We seek
to improve the quality and efficiency of prevention strategies using new approaches that will augment the
existing infrastructure at local HIV clinics in Peru and the Dominican Republic (DR). The aims of the
proposed Clinical Trials Center span the continuum of cervical cancer prevention from vaccination
through treatment. The trials we propose will address these technical issues and provide a more direct pipeline
for prevention. In this C2P2 Center, our overarching aims are:
  Specific Aim 1: To test the effectiveness of novel approaches to cervical cancer prevention in high-
 burden HIV-infected populations in Peru and the DR by performing three clinical trials. One will assess
 the ability of HPV vaccination regimens to elicit long-lasting B cell responses, and two will assess novel
 screening, triage, and treatment approaches that will improve the quality and reach of prevention in
 low-resource settings throughout the LAC region.
  Specific Aim 2: To build a robust multidirectional collaboration between study investigators at all sites
 that serves the needs of providers who care for women living with HIV. The Center will engage with
 leaders in the region to enhance the sustainability of efforts that target future elimination of cervical
 cancer through multiple high-impact prevention and treatment strategies."
10908378,"OVERALL ABSTRACT
The Partnership Center, entitled Multinational Partnership to Prevent HPV-Associated Cancer in People Living
with HIV: Brazil, Mexico, Puerto Rico (PHAC-BMPR), will bring together experienced research sites and world-
renowned HPV and HIV researchers to build on established collaborations to conduct clinical trials on
prevention of HPV-associated cancers among people living with HIV. This will provide an invaluable
opportunity for newer investigators from Latin America/Caribbean (LAC) to participate in and learn from high-
quality research.
PHAC-BMPR will focus on two HPV-associated cancers that result in substantial morbidity and mortality: HPV-
associated oropharyngeal cancer (HPV-OPC) and cervical cancer. These scientific goals are aligned with the
goals of the US National Institutes of Health for research priorities for people living with HIV/AIDS as well as in
country and regional goals to reduce cancer morbidity and mortality. At the end of this project, we hope to
make advances that will highly impact prevention of HPV-associated cancers in people living with HIV and
contribute to the global goal of cervical cancer elimination and reduction of other HPV-associated cancers such
as oropharyngeal cancer (OPC)."
10915383,"The overall goal of the Congenital and Perinatal Infections Consortium (CPIC) is to establish infrastructure and
institutional cooperation – focusing on rare congenital and perinatal viral infections – to advance understanding
of these diseases, improve clinical trial readiness, test therapies, advance patient care, and ultimately reduce
disease burden. These infections include congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease, neonatal herpes simplex
virus (HSV) infection, and neonatal viral sepsis caused by enteroviruses (EVs) and the related human
parechoviruses (HPeVs).
Led by researchers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) and supported by an experienced and
highly efficient study team, the 28 study sites that will comprise the CPIC have cooperated closely for decades
as the Collaborative Antiviral Study Group (CASG) to investigate the natural history and treatment of rare
congenital and perinatal infectious diseases. These longstanding relationships, as well as partnerships with
community and industry stakeholders, will facilitate the success of our research efforts and our mentored
career enhancement activities. As with all successful research programs, answers to critical questions always
lead to identification of the next important questions that will further advance the field. These questions are the
basis of the CPIC research portfolio that will advance the care of children with rare neonatal viral infections and
provide experiential mentored research opportunities as we train the future generation of rare diseases
researchers.
Aims of the CPIC are: 1) to build upon clinical research advances achieved by the CASG to further advance
the diagnosis, treatment, and understanding of HSV, CMV, and EV in the neonatal population; 2) to leverage
longstanding relationships across the 28 CPIC study sites and with stakeholders to conduct clinical research
projects with the highest of fidelity to all research standards; 3) to advance rare diseases research by sharing
standardized data through close partnership with the Data Management and Coordinating Center and by
utilizing cloud computing capacities and Common Data Elements; 4) to develop and utilize pilot and feasibility
funding to leverage existing institutional resources and maximize its impact on the advancement of the science
related to rare infectious diseases impacting neonates; and 5) to support mentored research and career
enhancement opportunities for clinical fellows and junior faculty to facilitate the development of early-stage
investigators in rare diseases research. Our Consortium will bring value to the Rare Diseases Clinical
Research Network by promoting unique understanding of these diseases, and by providing both a time-tested
research model and advanced pharmacometric expertise."
10820521,"Synchrotron radiation (SR) is an extremely bright and tunable x-ray source that enables forefront
research in structural molecular biology (SMB). The goal of “A Synchrotron Structural Biology
Resource"" at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) is to provide users access
to an integrated, mature SMB Resource with state-of-the-are synchrotron beam line facilities for
macromolecular crystallography, x-ray absorption/emission/imaging spectroscopy and small
angle x-ray scattering/diffraction, that form the three Resource Technical Operations Cores.
Special emphasis is to create streamlined user access, provide dedicated user support and
services, to train users, and to perform outreach on the scientific benefits of the capabilities of
these specialized, yet mature facilities to the biomedical research community. Multiple innovative
access mechanisms will be provided, that will include both single- and multiple-technique
approaches to access the Cores, based on a transparent and robust external peer-review
process. A multifaceted training and outreach program will include individual training, workshops,
summer schools, on-the-road, and support clinic segments by experienced science and technical
staff. A Resource web portal will provide streamlined scientific, technical, training, outreach and
administrative material and other relevant information. A principal aim is to optimize and maintain,
for reliable and forefront performance, experimental facilities and instrumentation, detectors,
software and computing and network capabilities on the SMB Resource’s 8+ beam lines at SSRL,
capitalizing on the high SR x-ray performance of SSRL’s 3rd generation storage ring SPEAR3,
and at the MFX station at LCLS. A multi-facility proposal mechanism will facilitate access to
complementary Cryo-EM and LCLS stations on-site at SLAC. With a specialized focus on user
training, support and service, the SMB Resource will enable the scientific success for challenging
and routine projects in the biomedical sciences."
10930027,"The lysosomal disorders (LD) are a group of approximately 70 inherited metabolic conditions resulting from
defects in lysosomal function; usually deficiency of a single enzyme required for the metabolism of lipids,
glycoproteins, or mucopolysaccharides. Collectively, LD are not especially rare; estimates suggest that
approximately 1:5,000 newborns will be affected with one identified LD. Individually however, each disorder
occurs with a much lower frequency. Assuming that 180 individuals per 1 million live births will be affected with
an LD, extrapolation incidences range from Gaucher at 25 per 1 million births to 7 per 1 million births for GM1-
gangliosidosis; other LD are much rarer still. Most LD are monogenetic disorders caused by a mutation in a
single gene and follow an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, although a few are X-linked recessive.
Although each LD results from a unique gene mutation, at the biochemical level they share a common
characteristic—the inability to clear metabolic substrate from the lysosome. Presenting symptoms vary widely
among the disorders and are modified by age of onset and severity (most LD present as either a severe or
attenuated phenotype); beyond categorization as severe or attenuated, a more specific genotype/phenotype
correlation has not been feasible. To date, about a dozen or so LD have therapeutic options, but apart from
MPS I, which has been shown amenable to stem cell transplant, LD drug therapies are not particularly effective
in those conditions with neurologic dysfunction. And while new treatments, be it next generation drug therapy,
gene therapy, or other gene editing techniques, are essential to improve outcomes for those affected with LD,
early detection is critical in order for a person with an LD to hope for a normal life. In the past three decades,
lysosomal diseases have been a test bed for some of the most innovative therapeutic modalities. In the past 9
years of NIH funding, the LDN has accelerated knowledge acquisition in the field—with 95 NCBI cited
publications—and furthered the development of therapeutic options. For the next 5 years, the overarching
thematic goals of the LDN are: clinical trial readiness, newborn screening, long-term outcomes, and global
reach. We will advance these goals through clinical investigation via 5 longitudinal studies focused on
elucidation of disease pathology by (a) CRIM status and immune tolerance induction in Pompe disease, (b)
cardiac and kidney pathology in Fabry disease, (c) multi-system survey (cardiac, developmental, skeletal,
QOL) in the mucopolysaccharidoses, and (d) MRI and biomarker development as outcome measures for the
gangliosidoses. The fifth project is a survey study designed to catalog both the odyssey individuals go through
before reaching a proper diagnosis and the effectiveness of therapeutics at allowing individuals with lysosomal
disease (specifically treated MPS) to live an independent life. Every participant who enrolls in an LDN project
is expected to complete the survey studies. Biostatistical analysis assures relevant statistical models for each
project."

10916163,"The revised P01CA234212 tests novel strategies to promote selective CTL entry into tumor micro-
environments (TME) and sensitize “cold” tumors to immunotherapy. Our preclinical and early clinical data
demonstrate that the chemokine-modulating (CKM) regimen targeting toll-like receptor-3 (TLR3), type-1
interferons (IFN) and the PGE2 system, selectively enhances CTL numbers but reduces regulatory T(reg) cells
in TME, uniformly sensitizing tumors for the therapeutic effectiveness of PD-1 blockers and specialized
dendritic cell vaccines (αDC1) in melanoma, colorectal cancer (CRC) and ovarian cancer (OvCa). We will now:
1) Determine local immunologic efficacy of systemically- or locally applied CKMs in cancer patients; 2) Identify
the most effective ways of using CKM to enhance antitumor effects DC therapies and PD-1 blockade; and 3)
Evaluate the clinical activity of the resulting therapies in PD-1-resistant cancer patients, and identify the most
relevant TME correlates of clinical benefit.
Project 1 Combinatorial adjuvants promote uniform and selective intratumoral CTL infiltration will test
in a Phase IIa trial NCT03403634 whether systemic administration of CKM composed of rintatolimod (TLR3-
ligand) IFNα and celecoxib promotes local CTL accumulation in TME of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC).
Magnitude of effects, tumor-selectivity (vs surrounding tissues) and mouse studies will guide the design of the
second trial which will evaluate the clinical efficacy of sequential CMK/anti-PD-1 application in CRC patients.
Project 2 Local immunotherapy corrects chemokine patterns in OvCa will complete the phase II portion of
trial NCT02432378 to test the specificity of local CKM in attracting CTLs (rather than Tregs) to the TME of
OvCa patients vaccinated with αDC1 loaded with own tumor cells (αDC1[tumor]) and identify “secondary”
mechanisms or treatment resistance. The results will inform preclinical studies and the design of the second
trial to determine the clinical activity of sequential treatment with DC[tumor]/CKM followed with PD-1 blockade.
Project 3 Chemokine modulation to enhance CD8+ TIL recruitment and cross-priming in the TME is
based on our latest observations (NCT01876212) of 57% objective response rate (ORR) to αDC1 vaccine
targeting tumor blood vessels (αDC1[TBVA] in the 4 of 7 melanoma patients with primary PD1 resistance and
46% objective clinical benefit overall (6/13 patients). We will now perform phase II trial to evaluate the clinical
activity of αDC1[DBVA] combined with systemic CKM (BB-IND16,704) in stage IV melanoma patients with
primary PD1 resistance. Using correlative studies and mouse in vivo models, we will develop optimized and
potentially simplified vaccines to complement CKM and PD-1 blockade for durable therapeutic benefit.
Impact: We will test widely-applicable complementary approaches to promote selective entry of therapeutic
CTLs into tumors. Since intratumoral CTL numbers predict survival and therapeutic advantage of checkpoint
blockers in multiple cancer types, the results are likely to benefit a broad range of cancer patients."
10913405,"There is an urgent need for evidence to guide clinical care of older adults due to demographic shifts, including
longer life expectancy and a recent doubling of the older adult population. Statins reduce recurrent CVD events
and prevent initial events in patients younger than 75 years. However, clinical research has often excluded
persons older than 75 years due to a higher prevalence of comorbidity and frailty so little to no evidence is
available to guide care in this population. For older adults living longer, the promise of preventing cognitive
impairment is as compelling as preventing a CVD event, but some evidence suggests statins may
contribute to memory difficulty or muscle symptoms. There is equipoise regarding the usefulness of statins
for primary CVD, dementia, and disability prevention in adults older than 75 years, especially in the setting
of multiple chronic conditions, advanced age, or frailty. Evidence to improve cognitive and functional
outcomes in older populations with diverse race/ethnicity and health status will require new clinical trial
approaches with sustainable methodology and infrastructure. We propose PREVENTABLE (PRagmatic
EValuation of evENTs And Benefits of Lipid-lowering in oldEr adults), the first statin trial with a non-CVD
primary outcome—survival free of dementia or persisting disability. Using a placebo-controlled pragmatic
clinical trial (PCT) design across PCORnet and VA network, the trial will be under the leadership of Dr. Karen
Alexander at DCRI, Dr. Jeff Williamson at WFSM, Dr. Adrian Hernandez at DCRI, and Dr. Walter Ambrosius at
WFSM. This team has established experience and track-record of accomplishment in the design and conduct
of PCTs, trial expertise in ascertaining cognitive and disability outcomes in older adults, and is supported by a
robust administrative infrastructure for coordinating these shared responsibilities for success. The overarching
goal of PREVENTABLE is to generate knowledge about the role of statins in older adults, a population in which
risk/benefit for primary prevention has been under studied. The hypothesis is that a large trial conducted in an
older adult population will demonstrate the benefit of statins for reducing dementia, disability, and CV events.
We further hypothesize that extensive genomic, biochemical and imaging ancillary studies will offer unique
insights into these key outcomes. PREVENTABLE has the following specific aims: AIM 1: Determine the role
of a moderate-intensity statin in preventing dementia and prolonging disability-free survival in patients 75 years
and older without clinically evident coronary heart disease, including those with frailty, impaired physical
function, mild cognitive impairment, polypharmacy, and multi-morbidity. AIM 2: Determine the role of moderate-
intensity statin in preventing hospitalization for myocardial infarction/acute coronary syndrome, stroke, heart
failure, revascularization or cardiovascular-related death, and preventing either mild cognitive impairment or
dementia. AIM 3: Test the safety and tolerability of statins in older adults and collect 17,000 bio-specimens to
advance precision health."

The Norris Cotton Cancer Center (NCCC) is responsible for overseeing all cancer-related academic and
clinical activities across the entirety of Dartmouth College and the Dartmouth-Hitchcock (D-H) health system,
as evidenced by 123 Members spanning 4 Schools and 24 Departments and NCCC-initiated research
infrastructure adopted campus-wide. In the current application, we summarize research accomplishments and
document fulfillment of the NCI’s Six Essential Characteristics for NCI-Designated Centers. The mission of
NCCC is to accelerate trans-disciplinary research to prevent and cure cancer, enhance survivorship, and
promote health equity, evident in significant funded patient-centric population science and diversity-focused
engagement of trainees across the education continuum. Reflecting deep integration within our host
institutions, NCCC is comprised of four truly trans-disciplinary research programs, reflecting active NCCC
Planning & Evaluation: Immunology and Cancer Immunotherapy (ICI); Translational Engineering in Cancer
(TEC); Cancer Biology and Therapeutics (CBT); and Cancer Population Sciences (CPS). Included in our
research portfolio are groundbreaking scientific initiatives in cancer immunology, cancer engineering, biological
mechanisms, experimental therapeutics, molecular epidemiology, health care delivery science and cancer
prevention and control, with an enhanced emphasis on translating research discoveries to hard-to-reach
populations, especially those within our rural two-state catchment area of New Hampshire and Vermont. NCCC
continues to be defined by its high impact scientific publications and the frequency with which they are enabled
by Cancer Center support of trans-disciplinary research, as evidenced by inter- (31%) and intra-(17%) co-
authorships, cancer themes in IDeA-funded program projects, and access to NCCC Shared Resources that
include several (e.g., Pathology, Trace Elements, Genomics) relied upon widely by other NCI designated
centers. Consistent with our commitment to both high quality science and the successful translation of
research discoveries to the clinic, the past five years have witnessed an 18% increase in our NIH-funded
research portfolio, including a >7:1 return on Developmental Funds, and a 62% increase in clinical trials
accrual, including funding as an NCTN lead participation site. Depth of Leadership was evidenced by
accomplishments during a recent Director transition. Shortly following the September 2017 arrival of Dr. Steven
Leach as Center Director, NCCC embarked upon a new 2018 Strategic Plan, which identified accelerating
translational and trans-disciplinary research as our single highest overarching strategic priority. Emanating
from this plan and enabled by a dramatic increase in investment from our parent institutions, in this application
we further document the launch of multiple new initiatives in faculty recruitment (8 completed in 2017-2018, 3
active, and 2 pending), faculty research support, education and community outreach, serving to propel a
comprehensive NCCC into its fifth decade of NCI designation."
10875693,"Project Summary
Remyelination failure is the hallmark of microvascular white matter injury (WMI) and commonly causes
cognitive impairment and dementia in the elderly. We propose that remyelination failure involves two
complementary mechanisms that generate hyaluronic acid fragments (HAf) that disrupt the maturation of
oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). First, we hypothesize that vascular endothelial cells generate HAf in
response to oxidative stress. Second, we hypothesize that vascular injury activates HAf-mediated mechanisms
that promote vascular lumen adhesion and trafficking of lymphocytes to cause white matter inflammation and
reactive astrocytosis to enhance HA/HAf levels. We will focus on human WMI confirmed by ante-mortem MRI-
defined white matter hyperintensities (WMHs). WMHs are the most widely used clinical predictor of risk for
vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). We will define aberrant HAf-mediated actions related to
cerebrovascular dysfunction in WMHs. We will build upon two recent advances. First, we will undertake
novel vascular physiology studies to define oxidative stress in arterioles isolated from human WMHs.
We showed that WM arterioles from VCID cases selectively displayed reduced endothelium-mediated
vasodilation that predisposes to WMI (Ann Neurol 83:142-152, 2018). Second, we will define aberrant HAf-
mediated mechanisms of myelination failure related to cerebrovascular dysfunction in WMHs. We have
defined a signaling pathway activated by cerebral ischemia where a specific bioactive HAf cell autonomously
blocks OPC maturation to cause myelination failure (J Clin Invest 128:2025-2041, 2018). We will thus utilize
our unique expertise in quantitation and analysis of HA fragments to determine the specific sizes that are
linked to myelination failure in WMHs through mechanisms involving the OPC-vascular niche. In aim 1, we will
employ a combination of molecular and morphometric approaches to test the hypothesis that remyelination
failure in WMHs arises from disrupted HA metabolism that mediates aberrant OPC proliferation and
blocks differentiation to myelinating oligodendrocytes. We will isolate vascular endothelial cell-derived
HAf from WMHs and determine its actions on OPC proliferation and differentiation. In aim 2, we will utilize a
combination of molecular, biochemical and histochemical approaches to test the hypothesis that WM vascular
dysfunction and oxidative/nitrosative stress are linked to altered HA synthesis, catabolism and
signaling in WMHs. In aim 3, we will employ novel murine and human in vitro models to test the hypothesis
that dysfunction of WM arterioles promotes inflammatory mechanisms of myelination failure mediated by
vascular lumen adhesion and trafficking of lymphocytes into WMHs. Our over-riding objective is to provide a
mechanistic molecular explanation for the distinct OPC-vascular processes that render aging human white

The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) is strongly-positioned to engage in the mission of the
Early Phase Pain Investigation Clinical Network (EPPIC-Net), with the ISMMS Department of Neurology as the
core of our hub and spokes structure. Our strengths include: (1) the large and diverse population we care for
and have successfully recruited into clinical trials over several decades including patients with high impact pain
syndromes such as chronic low back pain (CLBP), (2) our extensive clinical trials infrastructure, including close
integration with the ISMMS CTSA and Trials Innovation Network (TIN), for which the PI of this proposal leads
pain-related activities, and (3) a cadre of highly-experienced clinical trialists in multiple specialties with
expertise across the range of studies EPPIC-Net will perform including mechanistic studies, detailed
phenotyping of pain conditions, biomarker validation studies, and phase 2 clinical trials.
We are deeply committed to using these strengths and our experienced leadership team in service of the
EPPIC-Net mission which we strongly believe will ultimately produce the non-addictive pain treatments which
our patients so desperately need. In order to ensure that our site and the entire EPPIC-Net structure is a
success, our proposal has four specific aims: (1) to streamline and optimize rapid implementation of EPPIC-
Net studies, exceeding the required minimum of 100 subjects recruited per year to EPPIC-Net studies; (2) to
ensure access to patient populations with a wide range of pain disorders, including CLBP, using a hub and
spokes model to ensure effective recruitment; (3) to provide the highest-quality protocol implementation, deep
clinical phenotyping of pain disorders, and accurate and complete data collection; and (4) to work
collaboratively with the EPPIC-Net Coordinating Centers and investigators from the NIH HEAL Partnership to
assist with development/design of clinical trials and engage in EPPIC-Net leadership.
In addition to these aims we will promote the visibility of EPPIC-Net within our institution and the larger pain
research community, use our participation in EPPIC-Net as an opportunity to train junior investigators to
become future pain clinical trials leaders and increase and disseminate knowledge about pain research
throughout our network."
10903833,"Project Abstract – MAE-WEST SCORE Overall
Women age differently than men across the lifespan, culminating in a female predominance in morbid chronic
diseases such as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, and
chronic kidney disease. Women also tend to develop multi-organ syndromes (heart-brain, heart-kidney) more
frequently than men. The mechanisms underlying sex-specific differences in multi-organ dysfunction remain
poorly understood. Prior work indicates that women exhibit accelerated microvascular aging, a process
implicated in disorders of the heart, brain, and kidney. In this context, systemic inflammation has emerged as a
primary driver of both microvascular dysfunction and the development of these chronic disease states.
Preliminary data from our group indicates that eicosanoids, a diverse group of bioactive lipids that serve as the
upstream mediators of systemic inflammation, can influence endothelial cell function, exhibit sexual dimorphism
in circulating plasma, and are related to certain vascular phenotypes. Given these findings, we hypothesize that
sexual dimorphism in both local and systemic eicosanoid variation contributes to sex differences in microvascular
dysfunction and, in turn, to sex differences in age-related multi-organ disease. Motivated by our early findings
and the critical need to understand the determinants and drivers of sex differences in age-related disease
outcomes, we propose to create the Microvascular Aging and Eicosanoids –Women’s Evaluation of Systemic
aging Tenacity (MAE-WEST) Specialized Center of Research Excellence (SCORE) on Sex Differences.
Leveraging our collective expertise, we plan to advance the understanding of sex-specific molecular drivers of
chronic microvascular and end-organ disease through 3 foundational projects. In Project 1, we will examine
longitudinal variation in circulating eicosanoid levels in relation to age-related alterations in microvascular
function in end-organ (cardiovascular, neurocognitive, renal) disease traits in 2 large community cohorts. In
Project 2, we will prospectively enroll and deeply phenotype a cohort of women and men to assess the relation
of eicosanoids with organ-specific as well as global burden of microvascular disease, as well as their response
to a trial of intensive medical therapy with FDA-approved agents (statins and ACEi/ARB). Finally, in Project 3,
we will study the mechanistic role of sex-specific eicosanoid signaling on human endothelial cell function and on
microvascular function in experimental models of organ-specific disease as well as whole organism aging. As
an integral part of this SCORE, we will establish a Career Enhancement Center that will provide robust training
and mentorship for trainees and junior investigators. Collectively, this highly collaborative and innovative SCORE
aims to transform our understanding of sex differences in microvascular and chronic multi-organ diseases and,
in turn, enable effective interventions through inter-disciplinary science, education, and advocacy.

10106461,"Acute and chronic inflammation contributes significantly to poor health, most notably as a risk factor for
the development of atherosclerotic vascular disease and its complications, such as myocardial
infarction/acute coronary syndromes (ACS), strokes, and limb ischemia. The medical costs associated
with atherosclerosis contribute to preventable death and serious disability, which strain the VA health
care system. Despite the well-established relationship between inflammation, atherosclerotic disease
and ACS, treatment strategies are limited, due in part to a lack of understanding of the mechanism(s)
by which inflammation stimulates thrombosis. The ability of statin therapy to lower ACS in patients with
elevated C-reactive protein and the recent results from the CANTOS trial suggest that it may be
possible to prevent arterial thrombosis by targeting inflammation. A better understanding of the
inflammatory signals that contribute to acute thrombosis could provide a more precise strategy for
future interventions. In this proposal, we provide evidence that the acute phase reactant serum amyloid
A (SAA) has direct effects on platelet function. SAA levels increase dramatically with acute
inflammation and myocardial injury and are modestly elevated with chronic inflammation. Based on our
findings, we suggest the central hypothesis that SAA serves as a key link between inflammation and
thrombosis. To test this hypothesis, we have assembled an exceptional group of VA investigators with
complimentary expertise in inflammation and thrombosis and unique model systems and reagents.
Importantly, we have “gain” and “loss” of function animal models in which SAA levels can be modulated
independent of inflammation and following different inflammatory challenges. We will apply these
resources to accomplish the following two specific aims: (1) to identify the role of SAA in modulating
platelet aggregation and thrombosis and the molecular mechanism(s) involved and (2) to elucidate the
role of SAA in promoting platelet secretion and leukocyte interactions during inflammation. The aims of
this grant provide a vehicle to address a major unresolved issue in the field, namely identification of
specific inflammatory mediators that influence thrombosis through effects on platelet function and the
signaling pathways involved. These results will be significant, because they are expected to provide
innovative targets and provide proof-of-concept for novel inhibitors that may be used for prevention and
treatment for the complications of inflammation in humans."
10837828,"Despite anti-retroviral therapies (ART), HIV-1 continues to cause a considerable medical and economic burden, and there continues to be a pressing need for an HIV-1 cure. The goal of this Program is to generate an immune system that can resist HIV-1 infection, control viral replication below the limit of detection and persist at high functional competency in the absence of ART. We are currently performing a Phase I clinical trial that is infusing 10 billion T cells that have been made resistant to HIV infection and can recognize HIV infected via a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) into HIV infected individuals. A major goal of this consortium to develop strategies that improve the effector function, trafficking and persistence of these T cells. The elements of our proposal are: 1) Engineering HIV-specific T cells that have improved function and persistence (Project 1, John Wherry). This project will use well-characterized animal models to search for factors or pathways that augment T cell function and persistence to chronic infection. 2) Modeling HIV CAR T cell trafficking and persistence in Non-Human Primates (Project 2, Hans-Peter Kiem, Chris Peterson and Mike Betts). This project seeks to understand how CAR T cells traffic throughout the body and explores ways to alter this trafficking to favor HIV clearance. Additionally, the ability of HIV CAR T cells to become tissue resident memory T cells is explored. 3) Modeling combination immunotherapy for HIV Cure in a mouse models (Project 3, Jim Riley and Todd Allen). Here, we will explore how a wide array of immunotherapy approaches synergize to promote T cell control of HIV replication.4) Clinical trials engine to develop an HIV Cure study to test engineered T cells (Project 4, Usman Azam, Pablo Tebas and Jim Hoxie). This industry led project will develop an improved process to manufacture engineered T cells from HIV infected individuals and then take the most promising approaches developed by Projects 1-3 to conduct a Phase I clinical trial. The Program is supported by 2 Cores: Core A is the administrative Core (PI, Jim Riley); Core B is the Genome Engineering Core (PI, Rick Bushman). In addition, our Program takes advantage of existing School of Medicine and CFAR Cores to promote cost sharing and avoid duplication of resources."

This application seeks continued support for the Washington University DDRCC (WU-DDRCC). The overall
objective of the WU-DDRCC is to create an infrastructure that supports collaborative, multidisciplinary
investigation into host-environment interactions in digestive disease. The WU-DDRCC provides enabling
technology that promotes the basic and translational research interests of its 50 Full + 22 Associate members,
and nurtures career development of junior investigators. Our Research Base is highly productive as evidenced
by 248 original peer reviewed publications citing the DDRCC (60% reflecting collaborations involving two or more
members), including 58 in journals with impact factors >10, and increased funding support ($23.8M$30.9M;
30% increase since 2013). Our members have appointments in 13 different Departments across Washington
University. The Research Base interests are organized around three mechanistic themes: (1) Host-microbial
interactions, inflammation and mucosal immunity; (2) Stem cells, epithelial renewal, paligenosis and cancer; (3)
Metabolic homeostasis, nutrient transport and enterohepatic signaling. The Research Base is supported by three
Biomedical Cores that leverage institutional resources, and which have evolved in response to members' needs
to provide a cost-effective infrastructure. These Cores include (1) Advanced Imaging and Tissue Analysis Core
(AITAC), which provides sophisticated imaging technologies; (2) A new Precision Animal Models and Organoids
Core (PAMOC), which provides mouse genetic services and organoid technologies; and (3) a Biobank Core,
which provides access to clinical biospecimens from normal and disease states. These Cores are overseen by
a responsive Administrative Core (ARAC), guided by both Internal and External Advisory Boards to promote
collaborative and synergistic interactions and support Biomedical Cores and services that reflect current and
future needs of the Research Base with state-of-the-art services and specialized expertise, delivered cost-
effectively and efficiently. The WU-DDRCC also supports a scientific Enrichment Program sponsoring visiting
researchers and workshops to augment the scientific milieu, promote collaboration and stimulate development
of new initiatives in digestive disease. The Enrichment Program also promotes academic career development
by nurturing the interests of postdoctoral trainees, fellows and junior faculty, including promoting diversity in the
workforce through a targeted Underrepresented Minority speaker program. The WU-DDRCC has invested
significant resources and effort in building a pipeline of future leaders in digestive disease research by supporting
and nurturing new investigators through an annual Pilot and Feasibility Program for which there is greater than
39:1 return on investment over the last 15 Years (3 cycles) of this award. In addition, the WU-DDRCC is
committed to promoting and sharing technology development with NIDDK funded Centers locally as well as
other DDRCCs regionally, through the Midwest Alliance and the NIDDK Center program. Collectively, these
accomplishments serve to advance discovery in digestive disease that will impact patient care."
10857140,"Project Summary – Overall
 Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) represent a major public health burden. Genetic risk factors contribute
critically to susceptibility to AUDs and are likely a result of many variants each contributing modestly to risk.
Genetic studies in animal models and humans have to date made slow progress in identifying individual
genetic risk variants. However, modern high-throughput approaches such as genome-wide association studies
or genomic expression profiling promise to rapidly increase the pool of potential candidate genes influencing
AUDs. This proposal for a P50 Alcohol Research Center presents a novel and highly integrated overall design
to focus on both gene discovery and functional interpretation for the genetics of AUDs. This application is a
renewal of our currently funded P50 that supports the VCU Alcohol Research Center (VCU-ARC), which was
first funded with a P20 Developmental Center grant in 2009. We have made significant progress over the past
4.5 years and here seek to both continue aspects of our prior directions but also to extend our work into new
areas.
 Our approach continues to be innovative and significant due to three novel features: 1) A focus on gene
networks contributing to AUD-related phenotypes and ethanol behaviors, rather than single genes; 2) A cross-
species genetic and genomics analysis to validate candidate genes and networks affecting ethanol behaviors;
and 3) A highly integrative Center design with rapid data sharing across projects through a cross-species
analysis pipeline to provide ranked gene lists or networks for further experimental validation in the component
projects. We request five years of support for five research projects and pilot grants for genetic studies in
worms, flies, mice, rats and humans. Three projects will represent new areas of study, while two others will
renew their overall strategy of current projects but with novel areas of investigation. Two projects will be in
human genetics with state-of-the-art statistical approaches to leverage the power of large genome-wide
association and exome sequencing studies on phenotypes significantly associated with AUDs. All projects will
be supported by an Administrative Core, a Bioinformatics and Analysis Core and a Rodent Behavioral Core.
The scientific work proposed in these projects and cores is clearly greater than the sum of its parts, due to the
highly interactive structure of the VCU-ARC components. The VCU-ARC is well positioned to become a
national resource, making major contributions to the advancement of our understanding of the etiology of
AUDs and subsequently their prevention and treatment."
10819175,"Project Summary:
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) can be characterized by a pattern of compulsive alcohol drinking or loss of control
over alcohol drinking. The positive and negative effects of ethanol appear to be regulated by genetic and
epigenetic changes in several key brain regions. Long-term alcohol use causes structural and functional
changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus, amygdala, and ventral tegmental area of the brain which
may drive behavioral phenotypes, such as anxiety, depression, motivation, and increased alcohol drinking.
Several protein families such as histone deacetylases (HDACs), histone acetyltransferases (HATs), histone
methyltransferases (HMTs), DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), lysine demethylases, and DNA demethylases
are important players in chromatin remodeling within the genome and are altered by chronic ethanol exposure
and withdrawal. However, the interplay between these different epigenetic modifiers lead to an altered state of
the epigenome and their role in transcriptomic changes associated with adaptations in the reward and stress
systems in the brain (VTA, amygdala, PFC, and hippocampus) during AUD is still unclear. The overall aim of
this Alcohol Research Center is to evaluate the epigenetic and genetic basis of molecular changes in
the brain that underlie behavioral changes in AUD. This P50 application entitled “Center for Alcohol
Research in Epigenetics (CARE)” consists of four highly inter-related preclinical and translational research
projects [research project #1, VTA, (Brodie /Glover), research project #2, Amygdala, (Pandey), research project
#3, Hippocampus, (Lasek) and research project #4, PFC, (Guidotti/Grayson/Gavin)] and two current pilot
projects [pilot project #1 (Epigenetic biomarkers in AUD), and pilot project #2 (Epitranscriptomic modifications in
AUD)], and three Cores [Administrative (Pandey/Lasek), Epigenetics (Grayson/Maienschein-Cline), and
Behavioral Core (Glover/Zhang)]. In addition, the CARE will serve as an important resource and provide a
scientifically enriched environment for training opportunities for the next generation of neuroscientists studying
AUD and will disseminate scientific knowledge of AUD to the general public through a community outreach
program. The primary thematic focus of CARE, as a whole, will be to mechanistically link emerging novel
molecular targets identified by whole-genome approaches (ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and DNA
methylation/demethylation EPIC array) in the proposed brain circuitry to behavioral phenotypes. Mechanistic
approaches (CRISPR-dCas9, shRNA, siRNA, chemogenetic) will be used to manipulate the epigenome
through alterations of either histone acetylation/methylation mechanisms or DNA methylation mechanisms, in
key brain circuitry that regulates behavioral phenotypes associated with AUD (anxiety, depression, motivation,
and alcohol drinking) in order to better understand the pathophysiology of AUD and develop better
pharmacotherapy."
10831493,"Gene editing holds the promise of enhancing the precision and safety of anti-HIV gene therapies based on engineering hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC), in order to recreate elements of the Berlin Patient cure. Targeted nuclease technology is already being used to exploit NHEJ-mediated repair of DNA breaks and thereby disrupt the CCR5 gene, which mimics one aspect of his cure. However, extending this treatment to noncancer patients, receiving engineered autologous HSPC, will likely need to include other approaches. To do this, we are exploiting the alternate pathway of DNA break repair based on homology-directed repair (HDR). This can be used to introduce gain-of-function mutations into cellular restriction factors, or to direct the controlled secretion of soluble anti-viral factors, including the broad entry inhibitor eCD4-Ig. Moreover, the site-specific insertion at eCD4-Ig at the CCR5 locus would combine HIV-resistance with systemic protection and thereby provide a combinatorial anti-HIV approach. In the current proposal we aim to continue to improve the safety and efficacy of gene editing in HSPC, and to apply the technology to provide both local and systemic HIV resistance. We will combine our established anti-HIV approaches with a new direction to engineer production of broadly neutralizing antibodies, and thereby provide a novel synthetic immune capability. Individual strategies and combination approaches will be evaluated in appropriate mouse models, to evaluate their impact on HIV infection and the latent reservoir."

This competitive renewal application is to obtain continued funding for the Cleveland Digestive Diseases
Research Core Center (DDRCC), which is a combined effort between Case Western Reserve University
(CWRU) and the Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF). The Cleveland DDRCC's mission is to: 1) enhance the
research capabilities of Center investigators, 2) develop and implement programs to support the independent
development of young investigators, 3) attract established investigators not currently involved in digestive
disease research to apply their expertise to this important area of investigation, and 4) facilitate the translation
of basic research discoveries to the clinical arena. This cross-institutional and multi-disciplinary Center
currently includes 47 full members and 35 associate members from 25 different academic departments across
CWRU and the CCF, representing a steady expansion during the previous funding cycle. Together, these
investigators comprise the Research Base for the Center, which currently consists of $17.3 million in peer-
reviewed federal and foundation grants (52 NIH, 5 DOD/VA, 10 private foundation grants) specifically related to
the two scientific themes of the Cleveland DDRCC: Digestive Inflammation/Tumorigenesis and Liver
Disease/Metabolism. These two programmatic areas have strong historical track records of collaborative
investigation at CWRU and the CCF and have shown significant growth in collaboration during the previous
funding cycle. The Center enjoys strong institutional support, including a commitment of significant matching
funds from both CWRU and the CCF to increase the impact of digestive disease research at both institutions.
The Center includes three biomedical research cores to support this strong Research Base: 1) a Biorepository
Core, 2) an Histology/Imaging Core, and 3) a Mouse Models Core, all of which have demonstrated high levels
of usage by Center members and promoted important scientific discoveries in digestive diseases during the
previous funding cycle. Each Core includes both a set of high-volume standard services that are best provided
as a shared resource that can optimize cost-efficiency and quality control, as well as more cutting-edge
advanced services and technologies that may not otherwise be available to Center investigators. The Core
laboratories interface with a Administrative Core, which also supports a successful Pilot and Feasibility
Program to promote innovative research projects by investigators who are new to the area of digestive
diseases. The Administrative Core oversees the financial management and operation of the Cleveland DDRCC
and supports a Clinical Element, as well as a dynamic Enrichment Program that has supported the meetings of
the Midwest DDRCC Research Alliance and two Cleveland International Digestive Education and Science
(IDEAS) Symposia during the previous funding cycle. The overall objective of the Cleveland DDRCC is to
increase the availability of Core resources for Center members, and to foster research, collaborations, and new
directions in digestive disease research, leading to important scientific discoveries."
10850932,"Overall Abstract
This HIVRAD Program Project renewal application is made in response to PAR-18-319. It contains two Research
Projects, one Scientific Core and an Administrative Core, under the direction of Principal Investigator, John P.
Moore, PhD (Weill Cornell Medical College; WCMC) and co-Principal Investigator, Ian A. Wilson, PhD (The
Scripps Research Institute; TSRI). The goal of the project is to further develop stable, soluble, cleaved trimeric
mimics of the native Env spike (SOSIP trimers) as antigens for structural studies and as immunogens for the
development of vaccines aimed at inducing broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs).
 Our central hypothesis is that a proteolytically cleaved, soluble, trimeric form of HIV-1 Env is an
appropriate structural antigen for high resolution x-ray crystallography and electron microscopy studies, and a
suitable immunogen for vaccine research aimed at the induction of bNAbs. Our intent is to use structure-based
information to help develop an effective, prophylactic HIV-1 vaccine (or component of a more complex vaccine)
that is based on the concept of inducing sufficient titers of bNAbs. We believe that one way to accomplish this
goal is to make soluble recombinant protein mimics of the native, trimeric Env spike that is present on virions,
that mediates virus entry into cells and that is the target for all known bNAbs. SOSIP trimers have the desired
properties and can be produced efficiently, including in the amounts and qualities required for human clinical
trials.
 This HIVRAD project team has made excellent progress during the past 4 years, and now seeks support
to continue to work together. Its research plan involves the following sub-components.
Project 1: John P. Moore (and Rogier W. Sanders): Design of SOSIP trimers
Project 2: Ian A. Wilson (and Andrew B. Ward): Structural studies of SOSIP trimers
Core B: PJ Klasse: Production of SOSIP trimers
Core A: John P. Moore: Administrative support
Rogier W. Sanders of the Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Amsterdam will direct a sub-component of
Project 1.
Andrew B. Ward of The Scripps Research Institute will be the co-leader of Project 2.
 As well as the integral components of the HIVRAD team, we propose to maintain and expand an extensive
network of research collaborations, and we will continue to provide SOSIP trimers and related reagents to the
many scientists who request our support."
10818486,"Center Overview - Abstract
The vision for the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) Digestive Disease Research Core Center
(DDRCC) is to create a culture of curiosity, scholarship, and investigation around our central theme. Our theme
is informed by the pathogenesis of disease in the gastrointestinal tract, from cellular injury, inflammation, fibrosis,
and ultimately end organ dysfunction and disease. Our specific emphasis on human disease is part of our
rationale for the extension of the continuum of our theme - from injury to disease. Further, we expect the work
by Center members to lead to new treatments for patients with gastrointestinal disease.
Our specific aims are integrated with the specific goal to serve our Research Base/Full Members and our mission;
specific aims are as follows: (1) First, we will foster collaboration among digestive and liver disease
researchers. We will leverage collaborations among MUSC investigators to further augment our research
capacity while ensuring the success of a critical mass of outstanding researchers in digestive and liver diseases.
This will be supported through multiple synergistic efforts as described in the Administrative Core including
DDRCC leadership and Enrichment and Pilot and Feasibility Programs. (2) We will develop sustainable
scientific core resources that will specifically support digestive and liver disease studies while
leveraging institutional investments. The DDRCC scientific cores include: a) Analytical Cell Models Core,
which will deliver high quality, pure primary liver cells and produce state-of-the-art tissue culture models; b)
Advanced Imaging Core with advanced cell- and tissue-based imaging techniques and instrumentation; and c)
Proteomics Core with innovative mass spectrometry imaging capabilities. These cores are complemented by a
committed Clinical Component which provides support for the design, implementation and analysis of research
studies to improve clinical outcomes for patients with digestive diseases. Finally, we will (3) Promote the long-
term success and sustainability of the DDRCC through dedicated mentorship of New Investigators, a rigorous
Center evaluation and process improvement strategy, mission alignment with other centers at MUSC, and
specific long-term institutional commitments to the Center.
The MUSC DDRCC is made up of 29 Full Members focused specifically on our theme, and who constitute our
Research Base of $10.8M. We also have 31 Associate Members who are active participants in the Center. The
DDRCC has enormous potential to answer important questions, open new areas for further inquiry, and result in
potential new therapeutic discoveries that will be translated to new treatments for patients with digestive and
liver disease."
10833562,"Overall: Project Summary/Abstract
The hypothesis to be tested in our U19 Program Project is that combining therapies of gene-engineered cellular
(chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)) and humoral (broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAb)) immune reagents will
lead to a cure of HIV-1 disease. In the single remarkable case of the “Berlin patient”, allogeneic transplant of
CCR5Δ32 donor cells resulted in a functional cure without evidence for remaining HIV-1. However, a universal
unresolved limitation of transplant of gene-engineered hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) has been the
difficulty of achieving engraftment levels sufficient to provide good therapeutic efficacy. We propose here to focus
on building gene-engineered cellular and humoral immune therapeutics. One approach is a CAR recognizing
HIV-1 infected cells. T cell immunotherapy with tumor specific CARs delivered by adoptive T cell therapy has
proven to be effective against cancer in early human studies. We hypothesize that HSPC based delivery of CAR-
T cells can enhance the number and functional responses of the resultant engineered T cells. To complement
the engineering of T cell-mediated immunity, we also propose to engineer B cells to express bNAbs modified as
single chain variants (scFv-Fc bNAb). BNAbs directed to HIV-1 have shown promise at suppressing viremia in
animal models and clearing SHIV from the blood and tissues of infant rhesus macaques and human clinical
studies show effective suppression. Nonetheless, bNAbs require multiple injections to maintain levels required
to suppress virus in plasma and have not cleared virus in chronic infection. We will use novel lentiviral vectors
gene-engineered to target delivery of scFv-Fc bNAb into B cells in vivo without ex vivo manipulation. We
hypothesize that this strategy will promote bNAb production, biodistribution and activation/differentiation of gene-
modified B cells to clear HIV-1 reservoirs. Finally, success of these gene-modifying therapeutics depends upon
achieving sufficient systemic levels of gene-modified cells. Thus, another project will specifically address means
to modulate up or down the levels of gene-modified cells to achieve maximum therapeutic efficacy. In addition,
should any adverse effects be observed, the same reagent can be used to quickly eliminate gene-modified cells,
providing a “kill-switch”, and thus an added safety element to the overall approach.
Drs. Kitchen and Chen (UCLA) will serve as dual-PIs. Both have extensive experience in general stem cell
biology and its applications to HIV-1 disease. The Project/Core Leaders have expertise in HIV-1 biology and
gene therapeutic approaches to HIV-1 disease. The breadth of expertise ranges from vector and transgene
development (Chen, An, Morizono, Kitchen, Symonds), development and use of animal models for HSPC biology
(Kitchen, An, Morizono, Chen, Kiem), anti-HIV-1 immune function (Yang, Kitchen), understanding of HSPC
behavior (Chen) to clinical trial implementation (Symonds)."
10864926,"PROGRAM SUMMARY
In preliminary data we show the results of two studies demonstrating that a sustained state of ART-free
virologic remission, a ‘functional cure’, is possible in non-human primates. First, the Desrosiers laboratory
has shown that long-term expression of two broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) can suppress an
untreated SHIV-AD8 infection in three rhesus macaques, in one case, to undetectable (<15 copies/ml) for
over two years. Second, the Farzan laboratory has shown that long-term expression of the antibody-like
entry inhibitor eCD4-Ig can also efficiently suppress viral replication in five of six SHIV-AD8-infected rhesus
macaques for more than a year after cessation of anti-retroviral therapy (ART). We propose to build on
these initial results by making these functional cures safer, more consistent, and more robust. In the
process, we will establish a useful platform for evaluating latency-reversing agents (LRAs), a so-called
‘kick’, by providing an environment in which a potent ‘kill’ is always present, and develop a way to halt
transgene expression, thereby enabling time-to-rebound measurements. We will determine how best to
limit anti-drug antibodies (ADA) that emerge with AAV-expressed bNAbs. We will determine how to best
use ART or the long-lasting integrase inhibitor cabotegravir to establish AAV-mediated functional cures.
Finally, we will determine whether a sustained and potent kill can by itself change the decay rate of latently
infected cells. To do so, we have assembled a team with deep experience in HIV and SIV studies, years of
experience working together, and a long-term commitment to understanding and improving AAV-based
functional cures. These effort are accomplished with four projects and three cores. Project 1 will establish
robust functional cures in SHIV-AD8- and SIVmac239-infected macaques using AAV-expressed eCD4-Ig
and evaluate the impact of sustained eCD4-Ig on the viral reservoir. Project 2 will develop and test multiple
approaches for eliminating anti-drug antibodies that frequently emerge with AAV-expressed bNAbs. Project
3 will assess the impact of triple therapy and long-acting cabotegravir on the establishment of eCD4-Ig-
mediated functional cures, and determine how cabotegravir might best be combined with eCD4-Ig. Project
4 will develop a permanent off- and on-switches for AAV transgenes, facilitating time-of-rebound studies
after sustained bNAb expression and increasing the safety of AAV-mediated functional cures. These
projects are organized around a uniform experimental pipeline of assays supporting a series of non-human
primate studies, established and implemented by Core B. Core A will manage regulatory and logistical
aspects of the Program, and Core C will provide produce high-quality AAV particles for these studies, and
improve its capacity for doing so. Collectively these efforts will develop and improve a viable approach to
functional cures in humans, and provide tools and insight useful for complete eradication of the virus."
10903979,"The grand challenge addressed by the Penn Implementation Science Center in Cancer Control (Penn ISC3) is
to apply insights from behavioral economics to accelerate the pace at which evidence-based practices for cancer
care are deployed to improve outcomes for individuals with cancer. Penn offers a unique environment in which
to conduct this paradigm-shifting work, given our expertise in implementation science, behavioral economics,
and innovative cancer care delivery. The complementary and multi-disciplinary expertise of the three MPIs (Bei-

vance the quality of cancer care. The Administrative Core, led by Drs. Beidas, Bekelman, and Schnoll, will ensure
that the activities of Penn ISC3 are coordinated, synergistic, and congruent with timelines. The Implementation
Laboratory, led by Drs. Bekelman and Shulman, represents a diverse ecosystem that includes five hospitals and
linked clinical sites, with over 200 oncologists that serve over 15,000 unique new patients annually. Our Research
Program, led by Drs. Beidas and Buttenheim, will oversee the development and testing of implementation strat-
egies that target patients and clinicians within our Implementation Lab and are centered on the idea of ‘nudging’
for optimal implementation and effectiveness outcomes. The Research Program includes investigators with ex-
pertise in implementation science, behavioral economics, cancer care delivery research, healthcare innovation,
measurement, and mixed methods. In the first two years, we propose three Signature Pilot Projects and two
Methods Projects with a commitment to rapid learning that will allow Penn ISC3 to be optimally nimble. Signature
Pilot Project 1 (Jenssen/Leone) tests patient- and clinician-directed implementation strategies to increase referral
to tobacco cessation programs among cancer patients. Signature Pilot Project 2 (Bekelman/Patel) tests patient-
and clinician-directed implementation strategies to increase higher-value bone modifying agents in patients with
breast, lung, and prostate cancer. Common methods and measures are linked to allow for pooling of data and
to accomplish our objectives of testing multilevel implementation strategies and mechanisms across contexts.
Our exploratory and high-reward Signature Pilot Project 3 (Bekelman/Rendle) will test a patient-directed imple-
mentation strategy that leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to promote oral chemotherapy ad-

10763828,"Sinonasal epithelial cells (SNEC) line the sinus cavity and play important roles in orchestrating innate
and adaptive immune responses. We, and others, have demonstrated that SNEC from patients with chronic
rhinosinusitis (CRSwNP), are endogenously pro-inflammatory, hyper-responsive to environmental stimuli, and
promote immune cell infiltration and activation. Recently, multiple components of the complement (Cp) system
have been shown to be activated and up regulated in the mucosa of CRSwNP patients, including C3, though
how they contribute to CRS-related inflammation is unknown and thus the focus of these proposed studies.
Traditionally, the observed effect of Cp factors and receptors on various cell types was thought to be mediated
solely by Cp activation fragments generated in the serum, the lymph, or interstitial fluids. Yet, recent paradigm
shifting studies have shown that Cp generated by the cell itself can function in an autocrine, and unexpectedly,
an intracellular fashion, and that intracellular signaling is essential for regulating the cells functions. We have
shown that SNEC cells are the primary sinonasal cavity producers of C3, the central protein in the Cp pathway,
and that SNECs from CRSwNP have dysregulated intracellular stores of C3/C3a that can be rapidly mobilized
upon stimulation with exogenous irritates. In these proposed studies we will test the hypothesis that
dysregulated intracellular Cp signaling in SNEC plays a role in the epithelial cell dysfunction seen in CRSwNP.
We will test our hypothesis by executing two inter-related but independent specific aims. In Aim 1 we will
determine the role of local and intracellular Cp production in the regulation of human sinonasal epithelial cell
inflammation. Sub-Aim 1.1 we will to determine the role of intracellular versus extracellular C3 signaling on
SNEC functions. Sub-Aim 1.2 will test the hypothesis that inhibition of Cp-mediated signaling will reduce the
pro-inflammatory and hyper-responsive nature of CRSwNP SNEC such that they will function similarly to control
subject-derived SNEC. In Aim 2, determine the role local C3 production in the regulation of inflammation and
disease severity in a murine model of atopic CRS. Sub-Aim 2.1 will determine the role of locally produced C3 in
the sinonasal cavity using our C3-TdT tomato reporter mouse (C3-TdT), and by using a murine model of allergic
fungal CRS (Af-CRS) test the key cell types that generate Cp at baseline and under disease conditions. To mimic
the human Cp inhibitory therapies utilized in Aim 1, systemic and local C3 will be inhibited with Crry-Ig, and
intracellular C3 will be inhibited through the use of intracellular delivery of Crry-Ig with a novel cell penetrating
carrier protein (Feldan Shuttle). Using these novel approaches, we will dissect the impact of epithelial and
systemic Cp activity on disease development (sub-Aim 2.2), and the therapeutic potential of inhibiting C3 to
reverse established disease (sub-Aim 2.3) using the Af-CRS model. Together these studies will provide
mechanistic insights into how elevated epithelial intracellular and locally produced Cp can shape the local
immune microenvironment."

A dominant paradigm of environmental health science is the adverse outcome pathway. The adverse outcome
pathway contains an external segment and an internal segment. The external segment is a toxic chemical that
comes into contact with a person. That chemical may come from air, water, soil, or diet. The internal segment
of the outcome pathway consists of a chain of events: the chemical interacts with a biological target, which
triggers events that in turn lead to organ responses, organism responses, and population responses. This
framework supports the most important environmental health science questions of our era: What chemical
exposures cause disease? How do they cause disease? Why are some people more susceptible than others? How
can we predict toxicity? How can we mitigate the impacts of hazardous chemicals? How can we reduce the use
of toxic chemicals in commerce? To answer these questions, the OSU EHS CC has an established world-leading
position in two of the world's most powerful technologies for investigating the adverse outcome pathway. To
study the external segment, the Chemical Exposure (CXC) Facility Core has developed passive sampling
wristbands that capture volatile and semi-volatile organic chemicals, as well as analytical techniques that can
detect and quantify 1,500 compounds in a single run at low cost. To study the internal segment, the Zebrafish
Biomedical Research (ZBR) Facility Core has built the world's largest specific-pathogen-free (i.e., low-
experimental-noise) zebrafish environmental health sciences facility. Robots evaluate locomotor activity and
look for physical and behavioral endpoints. Full-genome transcriptomics analyses reveal which gene
expressions change before the phenotype changes. Together, the CXC and the ZBR give our investigators
uniquely powerful experimental capabilities in EHS. Furthermore, these technologies are more than
complementary; they are synergistic. We have applied wristband extracts as direct input to the zebrafish
bioassay and identified the most toxic compounds in chemical mixtures via effects-directed analysis. Our
Integrated Health Sciences Facilities and Community Engagement Cores will make these capabilities available
to the extended EHS community via a new translational research model. We plan to co-produce knowledge
with stakeholders in seven categories (residential communities, legislators, regulators, manufacturers, health
care providers, pharmaceutical firms, and non-profit organizations). EHS CC members will conduct cross-
sectoral multidisciplinary research with these stakeholders in order to generate actionable scientific evidence to
guide stakeholder decisions that will improve environmental public health."
10929381,"Stroke is the major cause of an adult disability epidemic in the US, with a major contribution from post-stroke cognitive impairment and dementia (PSCID), the rates of which are disproportionally high among the health disparity populations. Despite the PSCID’s overwhelming impact on public health, a knowledge gap exists with regard to the complex interaction between the acute stroke event and highly prevalent pre-existing brain pathology related to cerebrovascular (VCID) and Alzheimer’s disease, or related dementia (AD/ADRD). Understanding the factors that modulate PSCID risk in relation to index stroke event is critically important for developing personalized prognostication of PSCID, targeted interventions to prevent PSCID, and informing future clinical trial design. In response to this critical challenge, we propose Determinants of Incident Stroke Cognitive Outcomes and Vascular Effects on RecoverY (DISCOVERY), a collaborative network of clinical sites with access to acute stroke populations and the expertise and capacity for systematic assessment of PSCID led by a team of recognized experts in VCID, AD, acute stroke, health disparities, and multi-center research. The overarching goal of this proposal is to determine which specific subsets of stroke events cause (or do not cause) PSCID and which additional demographic (sex, race, ethnicity), clinical factors and comorbidities that synergize with acute stroke to result in or prevent PSCID. The overall scientific objective of this study is to elucidate mechanisms of brain resilience/susceptibility to PSCID in diverse US populations based on complex interplay between life-course exposure to multiple vascular risk factors, pre-existing burden of microvascular and neurodegenerative pathology, the effect of strategic acute stroke lesions, and the mediating effect of genomic/epigenomic variation. We will achieve this goal by implementing the DISCOVERY Network of 30 clinical sites, which under the leadership of the Administrative Core and guided by the research strategy delineated by the Recruitment and Retention, Statistics, and Repository Cores, will conduct a prospective, multi- center, observational, nested-cohort study of 8,000 nondemented ischemic and hemorrhagic incident stroke patients within 72 hours of symptom onset, who will be followed for a minimum of 2 years, with serial cognitive evaluations and assessments of functional outcome, with subsets undergoing research MRI and PET and comprehensive genetic/genomic and fluid biomarker testing. In a series of systematic, hypothesis driven experiments we will: 1) identify the independent and combined effect of the acute stroke lesion, pre-existing burden of disease, and baseline markers of brain resilience on PSCID; 2) examine the role of acute stroke as a critical factor in accelerating AD/ADRD and VCID pathology leading to PSCID; and 3) develop two distinct generalizable personalized-medicine models for individual patient outcome prediction and patient selection for clinical trials. DISCOVERY will become a landmark study to unravel the mechanisms of post-stroke cognitive disability, early stroke recovery, and potential targets for personalized prevention, intervention, and rehabilitation."
10815576,"The overall goal of the new University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Environmental Research
and Translation for Health (EaRTH) Center is to accelerate the pace of recognizing and preventing
environmental exposures that affect reproduction and development to improve human health across the lifespan.
Addressing the complex problems of environmental health requires partnerships across disciplines; mobilization
of technology for identification, intervention, and prevention; and education of future scientists and clinicians and
the public. The EaRTH Center is uniquely positioned to address these challenges and advance environmental
health. By virtue of its location at UCSF—a premier institution for biomedical research, translation of research
findings, and clinical training—and its strong interdisciplinary team, the EaRTH Center will fill a critical gap in a
prominent clinical and biomedical research setting. Our proposed UCSF P30 EaRTH Center will allow us to:
create opportunities for new research directions in environmental health at UCSF that are not currently possible;
nurture and sustain transdisciplinary research collaborations across a network of academics and diverse UCSF
departments to advance our understanding of the relationship between environment and disease; mentor and
grow the next generation of research and clinical leaders in environmental health; and embed environmental
health literacy within health care to accelerate prevention of environmentally mediated diseases. Our Center
tightly integrates 4 cores and 1 program: 1) an Administrative Core to provide leadership, infrastructure,
administrative and communication support, advice and oversight to coordinate all EaRTH Center operations; 2)
an Integrated Health Sciences Facility Core (IHSFC) that will provide consultation on study design, data
integration, data of environmental and social stressors, and translation and dissemination of research findings;
3) a Bioassay Facility Core that will provide state-of-the-art tools for measuring chemical exposures and their
effects on biological pathways; 4) a Community Engagement Core (CEC) to expand environmental health
education and resources for students and health professionals to embed environmental health within health care;
and 5) a Pilot Project Program to fund transdisciplinary projects enabling researchers to enter the field or add an
environmental component to their current research. Our integrated Center will lead to new scientific
understandings in environmental health tightly linked to our community outreach work, which will shift the
fundamental understanding of the role of environment in disease, leading to solutions to preventing harmful
exposures and improving health."
10817260,"PROJECT SUMMARY - Overall
The mission of the UC Davis Environmental Health Sciences Center (EHSC) is to advance understanding of
environmentally induced disease and disability and to translate this knowledge into interventions, new
practices or policy changes that reduce those exposures or mitigate their effects on health. The EHSC brings
together faculty from seven schools and colleges engaged in environmental health sciences (EHS) research
spanning molecular biosciences, environmental science, engineering, pathophysiology, biostatistics,
epidemiology, and community development, with relevance to human conditions. The EHSC has made huge
strides in less than 4 years. Among its notable achievements, the EHSC has: broken through silos,
transformed interdisciplinary collaboration into the standard modus operandi among our members, attracted
both new and established investigators, and placed environmental health on the radar of other Centers
throughout UC Davis. Increasingly, EHSC members are engaging with community stakeholders and seeking to
address community-driven questions. A few highlights of EHSC accomplishments are: 1) a novel vivarium
facility for air pollution health studies using real-time air pumped from a heavily trafficked tunnel; 2) a program
of research on exposures and health effects in response to hugely destructive wildfires now commonplace
throughout the western U.S.; 3) recruitment of many new investigators, including two underrepresented
minority women; establishment of a strong presence on social media. Guided by the NIEHS 2018-2023
Strategic Plan and the NIEHS Translational Research Framework, we adopted three overarching theme
areas: 1) interdisciplinary translational EHS linking molecular/cell culture experiments, whole animal assays,
human epidemiologic research, interventions, and policy; 2) integration of environment, social justice and
health to understand vulnerability and resilience; 3) building bridges with communities, clinicians, and policy-
makers. Layered on those broad themes, we continue to cultivate the historic UCD strengths in research on
respiratory, nervous, immune, metabolic, endocrine, and reproductive systems, and recently expanded into
cancer and climate-related health research. The Center has a Pilot Projects Program and four cores:
Administration, Integrative Health Sciences, Exposure Sciences and Community Engagement, as well as
various advisory committees. In the coming funding period, the UC Davis EHSC will expand its scope and
impact by 1) advancing cutting-edge research in exposure characterization, environmental health effects, their
molecular biologic mechanisms, and technology development for improving measurement of exposures and
biomarkers; 2) enlarging the cadre of EHS researchers, and 3) engaging with policy-makers, community
stakeholders and health professionals, to ensure relevance of our research and to translate findings into public
health improvement. The Center emphasizes inter-disciplinary and translational approaches to environmental
health issues and is developing partnerships with other Centers throughout UC Davis."
11166828,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a chronic and relapsing brain disease that is characterized by loss of control over
opioid use. It affects over 2 million Americans and causes one overdose death every 20-minutes. Despite
effective evidence-based treatments in the form of both behavioral interventions and FDA-approved medication
for addiction treatment (MAT), relapse rates are high and are associated with lack of retention in treatment and
a continued cycle of illicit opioid use. Further research is urgently needed to better understand the mechanisms
that contribute to ongoing illicit opioid use and poor retention in MAT and identify novel treatments. In response
to RFA-HL-19-029 and its call to conduct “mechanistic studies to determine the directionality of sleep and OUD
interactions in humans… and to identify new opportunities for prevention and improved therapy,” The
Collaboration Linking Opioid Use Disorder and Sleep (“CLOUDS”) Study will investigate patients on MAT to
elucidate potential causal mechanisms between sleep deficiency and OUD. We will conduct an observational
cohort study of N= 220 patients with OUD who were recently stabilized on MAT at a large opioid treatment
program in New Haven, CT. At baseline, all patients will undergo: (1) comprehensive assessments of sleep and
circadian rhythmicity (i.e., polysomnography, melatonin onset/offset, wrist actigraphy, and validated sleep and
circadian surveys); (2) a task-enriched functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) functional connectivity
protocol; (3) blood assays for measures of stress and sex hormones; (4) neuro-clinical status using validated
interviews, and surveys; and (5) physical home microenvironment and psychosocial family assessments.
Patients will be followed for 6 months for the primary outcome of % days of illicit opioid use. In this context, we
will pursue several specific aims. Aim1: Using fMRI network analyses, test whether there are different
neurocognitive connectivity patterns between patients with adequate vs. deficient sleep in brain systems involved
in addiction (e.g., executive function, reward processing) and assess the extent to which these “neural
fingerprints” predict ongoing opioid use. Aim 2: Evaluate the potential biologic, psychiatric, and pharmacologic
mechanisms that explain the causal pathway between sleep deficiency and opioid use by analyzing the
mediating effect of other selected known OUD risk factors including stress, pain, negative affect, and other
substance use. Aim 3: Test the extent to which ecologic factors such as psychosocial, family, and neighborhood
contextual factors associated with OUD contribute to sleep deficiency among patients in MAT. An experienced
multidisciplinary team of investigators with expertise in Sleep and Circadian Medicine, Biomedical Imaging,
Psychiatry, Addiction Medicine, Nursing, and Psychology will conduct this research. This proposal will fulfill a
critical step towards identifying novel sleep and circadian-focused treatment approaches that may lead to
improved outcomes for patients with OUD."
10817687,"The University of Louisville’s (UofL) Center for Integrative Environmental Health Science (CIEHS) brings
together a multidisciplinary group of investigators working together to develop a framework to understand the
complexities of and to integrate the interactions between environmental toxicants, life style factors, life stage,
genetics and gender and their roles in human health and disease. The CIEHS is uniquely positioned to build
transdisciplinary teams to tackle these problems by virtue of the multidisciplinary expertise of its members and
its geographic location. The Louisville Regional Community, composed of Metropolitan Louisville and the
counties of western Kentucky, is a unique mix of urban and rural environments with industrial and agricultural
exposures that is a microcosm of the United States. The region is plagued by rates of chronic disease (e.g.
cardiovascular, diabetes, cancer, etc.), all with environmental etiologies, that are among the highest in the
nation. The CIEHS facilitates research and training focused on: (1) exposure to industrial chemicals present in
the urban and rural KY environments (metals, VOCs, PCBs, vinyl chloride, etc.), (2) lifestyle factors (diet,
alcohol, socioeconomic stressors, obesity, etc.), and the modifications to response by life stage, genetics and
gender in development of chronic adult diseases. CIEHS is organized into three multi-disciplinary research
interest groups (multi-organ toxicology, cancer, and neurodevelopmental toxicology). The Integrated Health
Science Facility Core promotes translation of basic science including assistance with both adult and pediatric
clinical trials. The Community Engagement Core promotes multi-directional communication between CIEHS
investigators and community groups with special focus on rural health care providers and youth groups. The
Pilot Project Program provides resources supporting new environmental health investigators, collaborations
between CIEHS members and established investigators bringing new skill sets to environmental health
problems, new avenues of environmental health research by CIEHS members, and community-engaged and
community-led research in collaboration with CIEHS members. A Career Development Program provides
mentorship and support to new junior, as well as mid-level, investigators. These activities are supported by two
facility cores (biostatistics and informatics, and integrated toxicomics and environmental measurements). The
CIEHS provides leadership in environmental health research, promotes investigation of the interactions of
chronic exposure to environmental toxicants and lifestyle factors in pathogenesis, and develops the next
generation of environmental health researchers. Our studies utilize model systems in the laboratory, the larger
ecosystem by investigation of pollution effects on wildlife, and the human laboratory provided by the Louisville
Regional Community in collaboration with community partners."

The 3 overarching goals of the USC Alzheimer Disease Research Center (ADRC) are to: 1) Elucidate vascular
contributions to Alzheimer disease (AD), 2) catalyze basic, clinical, and translational research in AD at
USC, and 3) contribute expertise in vascular disease, biomarkers, and imaging to national collaborative
initiatives. The ADRC is led by 3 multiple PD/PIs: Chui, Zlokovic, and Toga and comprised of 6 required cores,
the required Research Education Component (REC), and 1 optional imaging core. The Administration Core
(Chui, Zlokovic, Toga) provides administrative and scientific oversight across USC ADRC, including fostering
development projects and supporting ADRC-affiliated studies. The Clinical Core (Schneider, Ringman, Chui)
performs standardized evaluations and diagnoses using the NACC Uniform Data Set (UDS), enrolls and follows
participants in our 2 primary ADRC cohorts: Vascular Cohort Study (VCS) and Brain Research Study (BRS).
The Data Management and Statistical Core (Toga and Chen) oversees the NACC UDS database, provides
study- and core-specific databases and curates our large imaging data sets as a local and national resource.
The Neuropathology Core (Miller and Hawes) performs standardized neuropathological examinations, stores
and distributes biological tissues to research investigators. The Outreach, Recruitment, and Engagement Core
(Aranda) works closely with the Clinical Core to recruit and retain the primary ADRC cohort, focusing on under-
represented minority groups (especially Latinx), and the development of a participant-caregiver dyad resource
database. The Biomarker Core (Zlokovic) uses state of the art methods to determine cell-and system-specific
biomarkers related to the neurovascular unit, as well as to measure standard AD biomarkers. The Imaging Core
(Toga and Pa) provides high field (3T and 7T) MR imaging, as well as amyloid/tau PET scans. The Research
Education Component (Yassine) is dedicated to mentoring post-doctoral students committed to the study of
minority issues in Alzheimer disease and related disorders. The USC Health Science Campus is located near
high Latinx catchment areas. Treatable vascular-metabolic risk factors (VMRF) are particularly prevalent among
the Latinx population and dovetail with the research focus of the USC ADRC."
11137284,"The opioid crisis continues to devastate the lives of countless people and communities across the United
States. For individuals with moderate to severe opioid use disorder (OUD), medication-assisted treatments
(MATs) such as oral methadone and extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) are the gold standard in initiating
and maintaining long-term recovery. Still, many patients struggle with persistent sleep disturbance and stress
reactivity in the early stages of recovery, which drive relapse behaviors. Research on sleep disturbance and
the circadian rhythms of stress in the human experience of OUD recovery is scarce. This proposal constitutes
a novel mechanistic approach to understanding the role of the orexin system in sleep disturbance and
circadian rhythms of stress in OUD patients who are maintained on either oral methadone or XR-NTX and are
early in recovery. The scientific premise of this study is based on a rich preclinical literature demonstrating that
increased orexin signaling disrupts sleep, increases stress via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-
axis), and drives drug seeking behaviors in rodent models. The proposed study will determine whether the
FDA-approved sleep medication, suvorexant (SUVO)—a dual orexin-receptor antagonist—improves sleep
continuity and decreases diurnal measures of stress, and whether improvement of sleep/stress processes
translates to improved OUD treatment outcomes including reduced opioid relapse. To execute this study, we
have assembled an exceptional team of experts in OUD, MATs, sleep, stress, and ambulatory monitoring. This
study will recruit persons with OUD who have been abstinent from illicit opioids for 3-6 weeks, report sleep
disturbance, and are utilizing a stable dose of oral methadone (n=100) or XR-NTX (n=100). The study will
consist of baseline measurements for 7 days (week 0) followed by randomization to either 20mg SUVO or
placebo for an 8-week, double-blind randomized-controlled trial. Participants will undergo daily ambulatory
monitoring of sleep and daytime activity throughout the study using wrist-worn actigraphy and electronic sleep
diaries (weeks 0-8). Moreover, participants will undergo more intensive Data Bursts during study weeks 0
(baseline), 1, 4, and 8, which consist of four-times-daily ecological momentary assessments (EMA) of self-
reported stress, craving, and affect, and diurnal salivary cortisol. Primary analyses 1 and 2 examine the effect
of SUVO on total sleep time (TST), wake after sleep onset (WASO), and diurnal self-reported stress and
separately in patients on oral methadone or XR-NTX, respectively. Primary analysis 3 examines the effect of
TST, WASO, and diurnal self-reported stress and salivary cortisol on opioid relapse, across MATs. Exploratory
analyses include the effect of SUVO on opioid relapse and treatment retention, and the effect of MAT status on
TST, WASO, and diurnal self-reported stress and salivary cortisol within the placebo condition. The proposed
study will fill critical gaps in our understanding of the role of the orexin system in sleep disturbance and
circadian rhythms of stress that impact OUD recovery."
11140118,"Chronic pain and opioid use disorders (OUD) are burgeoning interrelated epidemics. There is a major public
health need to investigate modifiable risk factors and elucidate the pathophysiology of these poorly understood
disorders so that novel therapies and prevention efforts can be developed. Sleep disturbances, especially
insomnia and sleep apnea are highly prevalent, treatable and increasingly recognized as risk factors for both
chronic pain and OUD. It is not known, however, whether sleep disturbance causally alters mechanisms that
contribute to OUD risk. Sleep disruption impairs endogenous pain inhibition; a phenomenon associated with
descending neural pathways that are linked to both the analgesic efficacy and rewarding properties mu-opioid
receptor (MOR) agonists. This suggests that cerebral MOR dysregulation may be a shared neurobiological
mechanism by which sleep disturbance causally increases risk for chronic pain and OUD. Direct interrogation
of cerebral MOR availability, however, has yet to be undertaken after experimental sleep deprivation in
humans. Based on preclinical data and our preliminary studies, we hypothesize that sleep continuity disruption
(SCD) and/or sleep fragmentation (SF), two sleep patterns commonly observed in both chronic pain and OUD,
will alter cerebral MOR availability in descending pain inhibitory and reward processing pathways. We further
hypothesize that these forms of sleep disruption will increase OUD risk by reducing opioid analgesic efficacy
and/or enhancing standard abuse liability measures. We propose a parallel group experiment that will
randomize 100 healthy subjects to two nights of either experimental: 1) SCD (frank, prolonged, nightly
awakenings with curtailed sleep duration, a pattern associated with insomnia); 2) SF (multiple, frequent, non-
waking arousals with preserved sleep duration, a pattern observed in sleep apnea); or 3) undisturbed sleep
(US). Subjects will then complete two [11C]Carfentanil PET brain imaging scans (resting to measure basal MOR
binding potential (BP) and during pain to quantify endogenous opioid release). We will then use a placebo-
controlled, cumulative dose paradigm to evaluate the analgesic efficacy and abuse liability of the prototypic
MOR agonist, hydromorphone. Analgesic efficacy and abuse liability will be evaluated using quantitative
sensory testing and standard procedures. We aim to: 1) evaluate whether experimental SCD and/or SF alter
resting or pain-evoked MOR BP in brain regions associated with pain inhibition; 2) examine whether SCD
and/or SF alters the analgesic response and abuse liability profile of hydromorphone; and 3) determine
whether MOR BPs in brain regions of interest are associated with hydromorphone analgesia and abuse
liability. We will also evaluate the extent to which associations differ by sleep condition or sex. Establishing
whether common and treatable forms of sleep disturbance directly alter cerebral MOR availability, opioid
analgesia and abuse liability will transform the understanding of how sleep disturbance is a risk factor for OUD
and chronic pain and lead to novel prevention efforts and changes in pain management practice."

10817776,"OVERALL : ABSTRACT
This is the third competing continuation for an accomplished Environmental Health Sciences Core Center (EHS
CC), The Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET) at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn).
The Director is Trevor M. Penning, PhD (The Thelma Brown and Henry Charles Molinoff Professor of
Pharmacology) and the Deputy Director is Rebecca A. Simmons, MD (The Hallam Hurt Endowed Professor in
Pediatrics). The Center is comprised of 71 members from 18 Departments and 5 Schools, with almost equal
representation of basic and clinician-scientists drawn from the Perelman School of Medicine (PSOM) and
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). The CEET has built an institutional, regional and national identity in
environmental health sciences (EHS) in the absence of a School of Public Health and Department of EHS at
Penn. The synergistic combination of basic and clinician-scientists within the CEET promotes translational
environmental health research that addresses fundamental questions and translates knowledge into action to
have a major impact on human health and disease consistent with the NIEHS Strategic Plan. The CEET mission
is to “elucidate the mechanistic links between environmental exposures and human disease, and
translate findings into action to improve the health of vulnerable individuals, and local, national, and
global communities”. This mission is accomplished through five aims. In Aim 1: We use a flexible thematic
area structure to conduct translational environmental health research to improve precision public health. Our
current themes are in Air Pollution & Lung Health; Environmental Exposures & Cancer; Windows-of-
Susceptibility; and Environmental Neuroscience. Each thematic area integrates the pillars or exposure science,
adverse outcome constructs (pathways and networks) to explain the phenome with translation to communities
and human subjects. In Aim 2: We conduct bi-directional communication with communities in S.E and N.E.
Pennsylvania and use community engagement to set the research agenda for the CEET. In Aim 3: We provide
a facility core structure to promote precision public health. Our Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core is adept
in human subject study design and in conducting population exposure services, using cartographic modeling,
GIS tools and biosensors. Biomarkers of exposure and effect are measured in our Translational Biomarker Core
which conducts mass spectrometric assays at a level of precision and accuracy difficult to emulate elsewhere.
The Exposure Biology Informatics Core brings to bear the power of computation, machine learning and AI to
predict the toxicity of unknowns and integrate Big-data sets to recognize patterns in “omics” data and predict
adverse outcomes. In Aim 4: We build capacity in environmental health sciences by funding pilot projects to
Early Stage Investigators (ESI) and to senior investigators conducting environmental health research for the first
time. In Aim 5: We cultivate the careers of ESI through a transformative Environmental Health Scientist Support
Program that provides mentoring, grant proposal review, environmental health and Facility Core workshops."

Nearly 53 million people (17% of the US population; 18% of children <5 yrs) live within 3 miles of a Superfund
remediation site. Superfund sites contain a wide variety of pollutants, including organic chemicals, metals, carbo-
naceous material and silica. Although each of these components is capable of damage to organisms, their poten-
tial to combine into unique hazardous agents has been understudied. Interestingly, when these agents are pre-
sent together, particularly during thermal remediation, they combine to form particulate matter (PM) with chemi-
sorbed free radicals that persist in the environment and yet are biologically active. We call these pollutant-particle
systems environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs). EPFRs are produced during thermal treatment of haz-
ardous wastes and nearly 30% of all Superfund sites (excluding groundwater) are remediated by thermal treat-
ment. EPFR concentrations near Superfund sites range from 1x1018-4x1019 EPFRs/g (spins/g) of PM. This sug-
gests a vast number of US residents are exposed to PM containing EPFRs. LSU Superfund Research Center
researchers have shown that these EPFRs 1) induce cardiac and pulmonary dysfunction in the exposed host, 2)
are associated with current wheeze in children if present in household dust, and 3) are intermediates in the for-
mation of new pollutants such as dioxins. Our Center now seeks to understand how EPFRs induce pulmo-
nary/cardiovascular dysfunction and how to attenuate EPFR formation, facilitate EPFR decay, and limit exposure
to EPFRs, with the ultimate goal of improving human health and the environment. We will determine how EPFRs
are formed, stabilized, and decay and how they catalytically cycle to produce hydroxyl radicals. This will be done
using a suite of advanced surface and chemical analyses. Since the airway is a major site of entry of environ-
mental PM, we will demonstrate a link between EPFR exposure and poor respiratory health in children using es-
tablished community-based birth cohorts. We will explore mechanisms of EPFR-induced asthma and cardiovas-
cular disease using mouse models exposed by inhalation. Support cores (Administration, Data Management &
Analysis, Community Engagement, Research Experience and Training Coordination, Materials, and Inhalation
Toxicology) will provide essential, centralized reagents/services and technological resources allowing for
precision of data and economy of effort, and foster interdisciplinary activities. To ensure success, experts in these
respective fields were brought together as an External Advisory Committee to advise this Center. The chemistry
and physics of EPFRs, let alone their health impacts, are poorly understood, and an interdisciplinary approach
is required to address the critical research areas."

HIV (VLWH) and delivered cost savings. However, no VHA HIV clinics have implemented HITIDES. The goal
of this study is to support broad implementation of the HITIDES intervention by testing two appropriate
implementation strategies: a clinical champion from each site who, with the help of a learning collaborative of
peers, will work with local clinicians and leadership to implement the HITIDES intervention at their site with and
without the assistance of external facilitation from an implementation expert.
Significance/Impact: Preliminary work has been completed to identify implementation strategies acceptable to
VLWH and HIV care providers; however, the relative effectiveness and cost of these implementation strategies
is unknown. While the HITIDES depression care team (DCT) is housed off-site and can deliver services
consistently with high quality and fidelity, the ability of the DCT to interface and engage with HIV care providers
at sites is unknown. Additionally, the mediating effect of site-level implementation outcomes such as reach and
adoption on effectiveness of the intervention is unknown. Because the DCT can provide services to multiple
HIV clinics, a small-scale rollout of the intervention is needed before considering a national roll out.
Innovation: This study employs an innovative hybrid study design to concurrently examine implementation and
effectiveness outcomes. The use of implementation success as a mediating factor for intervention
effectiveness is also novel. The relative ability of implementation activities to impact care for vulnerable
populations is an area of research where little is known. VHA HIV clinics are an ideal test case for examining
these questions because VLWH are a group where racial minority, low income, sexual minority Veterans are
disproportionately represented.
Specific Aims: 1) Determine, through a cluster-randomized controlled trial among VHA HIV clinics, the effect of
adding external facilitation to an implementation strategy consisting of a site-level clinical champion and
learning collaborative. 2) Determine the impact of HITIDES on changes in depression and suicidal ideation
among HIV-positive Veterans receiving the intervention. 3) Estimate the budget impact of HITIDES
implementation strategies by calculating the costs of each strategy.
Methodology: The use of a hybrid type-3 effectiveness-implementation trial to examine the interaction of
implementation and intervention effectiveness is an innovative methodology ideal for situations where the lack
of robust evidence of effectiveness is coupled with a cost-saving intervention. This hybrid trial will use a cluster
randomization of 8 VHA HIV clinics. These clinics will be chosen for balance and diversity of clinic
characteristics and randomly assigned to one of the two implementation arms. Evaluation of each aim will use
a mix of primary (e.g., QUERI-developed time-tracking tool) and secondary (e.g., clinical data warehouse)
data. We expect the clinical champion, learning collaborative, and external facilitation arm to be associated
with greater reach and adoption; however, the clinical champion and learning collaborative alone arm is
expected to be less costly.
Next steps: The findings from implementation of the HITIDES intervention to 8 VHA HIV clinics will be used to
inform selection of implementation strategies for a broad roll out in the future. Findings will be presented in
cooperation with our operational partner, VA HIV, Hepatitis C, and Related Condition Program to VACO and
VISN leadership."
10802421,"The prevalence rates for children’s mental, emotional, and behavioral (MEB) disorders, as well as for childhood
obesity, are at alarmingly high levels and constitute major public health concerns. To address these critical
problems in childhood, the University of South Carolina Research Center for Child Well-Being focuses on
prevention and intervention research aimed at reducing risk for MEB and obesogenic problems in children
ages 2-10. The two overall goals are: (1) to create and cultivate a high-impact research center composed of
adept early-stage investigators supported by accomplished senior scientific adviser-mentors, committed to
research on the prevention and reduction of mental, emotional, behavioral, and lifestyle-related risk factors in
childhood; and (2) to strengthen the infrastructure that will facilitate greater contributions to scientific progress
and innovation aimed at improving child well-being by reducing risk for MEB disorders, childhood obesity, and
other adverse conditions. Accomplishment of the Center’s goals are being pursued through three specific aims.
Aim 1 is to establish a strong infrastructure to buttress and advance the Center’s research and programmatic
goals to develop capacity and to support early-stage investigators who will conduct preventive intervention
outcome trials and associated studies. Aim 2 is to nurture and expand a critical mass of early-stage faculty
researchers via: (a) thematically linked research projects by the promising scientists; (b) scientific mentoring
from dedicated and expert senior advisers; (c) two research core facilities (Clinical Trials Logistics Core;
Statistical and Data Management Core) integrally involved in supporting the research projects; (d) a local
Community Advisory Board to enhance engagement of communities and schools; and (e) a Pilot Seed Project
program. Aim 3 is to expand research capacity through targeted recruitment and cultivation of additional early-
stage faculty researchers in multiple disciplines and areas central to the Center’s mission and focus, backed by
cogent institutional support for targeted hiring of new faculty. Key cross-cutting themes of the research projects
and the Center as a whole emphasize preventive intervention strategies to promote more nurturing
environments for healthy child development, to strengthen children’s self-regulation, to ensure that the
interventions benefit children from lower SES backgrounds without stigmatizing them, and to study and bolster
quality of implementation for the interventions. The Research Center for Child Well-Being is poised to
accelerate the trajectories of early-stage investigators to independent researcher status, adding to the nation’s
workforce for the next generation of prevention scientists. The Center has considerable potential through
innovative research to progress the scientific basis for joint prevention of mental/behavioral and obesogenic
problems, leading to greater well-being of children."

The Oregon State University Superfund Research Program (SRP), in partnership with Pacific Northwest
National Laboratories and other stakeholders and collaborators, seeks to develop new technologies to
identify the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) mixtures found at many of the nation's Superfund sites
before and after remediation. We will identify novel hazard and toxicity mechanisms for PAHs and real-world
PAH mixtures. The SRP will support three biomedical research projects and two environmental science and
engineering projects. We aligned these research projects with the four SRP mandates to address pressing
challenges at Superfund sites. The Administrative, Community Engagement, Chemical Mixtures, Research
Experience and Training, and Data Management and Analysis cores support the research projects. This
proposal builds on our successes during the previous grant period. Over the next five years, we will pursue
innovative, high-impact research goals. For example, we propose to (1) develop the first generalizable
technology to measure the movement of PAHs to and from Superfund sites, (2) measure external exposures
to PAHs for individuals near Superfund sites and determine how their exposures vary as a function of
location, (3) predict the secondary transformation products of PAHs that will form during biotic and abiotic
remediation at Superfund sites, (4) predict the toxicity of complex PAH mixtures using zebrafish, (5) link
PAH exposure to health outcomes with the aid of a powerful human in vitro respiratory model, and (6)
elucidate metabolic and physicochemical control of PAH susceptibility in toxicity systems. The cores will (1)
direct the activities of the SRP and disseminate our findings to stakeholders (Administrative), (2) work with
communities impacted by PAH exposure to address concerns and reduce risk (Community Engagement); (3)
provide intensive multi-disciplinary training for the next generation of Environmental Health Scientists
(RETCC), (4) provide data management and analysis support (DMAC), and (5) apply state-of- the-art
chemistry instrumentation and approaches to measure PAHs and PAH mixtures found in environmental and
biological matrices. By accomplishing these goals, we will advance the frontiers of science and also improve
the quality of life for impacted communities."

Abstract
The National Resource for Translational and Developmental Proteomics, or NRTDP, proposes a constellation of
activities in its second phase of operation. After launching in 2015 and establishing functional programs in each
mission of a P41 BTRR, we now turn toward the proposed granting period from 2020 – 2025 to develop new
technologies and translate them by enabling both practitioners to analyze proteoforms and many collaborators
to understand their biology more deeply. Consistent with changes in the P41 program, we place major emphasis
on enabling basic and clinical research in proteomics, reduction to practice to extend innovations to early
adopters of new implementations of top-down proteomics, which is itself a new concept to many we
encounter. We also embrace mechanisms including corporate partnerships, community engagement, training
and dissemination to ensure a sustainable impact even after the sunset of this P41 National Resource.
After booting up our operation, we now posit three new Technology Research and Development Projects, six
new Driving Biomedical Projects, a highly dynamic set of collaborative projects and an array of Community
Engagement activities to continue serving our unique role within the set of P41 Resources currently supported
by NIGMS. The technology and support emanating from our resource will continue to provide collaborators with
orthogonal data streams and further demonstrate the value of measuring proteins more precisely than is possible
with current-generation technology of “bottom-up” proteomics. From heart disease to cancer research,
neurology and age-related disorders to immunology, the analysis of proteins and proteoforms and their post-
translational modifications will continue to unveil underlying molecular mechanisms through new and cell-specific
technologies for precision proteomics. This will enable clinicians and cell biologists across four major disease
areas, and significantly bolster American interests with an internationally-recognized excellence in a new style
of mass spectrometry-based proteomics that complements existing areas of investment across the nation. The
geographical distribution of collaborators and training activities are consistent with a mature resource that
reaches the level of operation envisaged in the original grant proposal in 2015.
The institutional support is very strong from an environment of Northwestern University on both its basic science
and medical research campuses in the greater Chicago area. Leveraging a team of professional proteomicists
with diverse backgrounds and experiences, the NRTDP has proven to be a highly capable enterprise that returns
strongly on programmatic support received by NIGMS. As a unit, we place high value on attentiveness to the
spirit and the letter of the P41 program, and also seek to synergize with other P41s within the current portfolio
supported by the NIGMS and NIH."
10709408,"Summary
Chronic pain is a major health burden associated with immense economic and social costs. Predictive
biomarkers that can identify individuals at risk of developing severe and persistent pain, which is associated with
worse disability and greater reliance on opioids, would promote aggressive, early intervention that could halt the
transition to chronic pain. Our team has uncovered evidence of a unique cortical biomarker signature that predicts
pain susceptibility (severity and duration). The biomarker signature combines resting state sensorimotor peak
alpha frequency (PAF) measured using electroencephalograph (EEG) and corticomotor excitability (CME)
measured using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). This PAF/CME biomarker signature could be capable
of predicting the severity of pain experienced by an individual minutes to months in the future, as well as the
duration of pain (time to recovery). In the R61 phase of the current proposal, we aim to undertake analytical
validation of this biomarker in healthy participants using a standardized model of the transition to sustained
myofascial temporomandibular pain (masseter intramuscular injection of nerve growth factor, n=150). We will
record PAF/CME at multiple time points before and during the development of pain and use online diaries and
in-laboratory assessments of pain, sleep, stress, and other psychosocial variables. Specifically, we will test if the
biomarker signature predicts an individual's pain sensitivity (high- or low-pain sensitive) with at least 75%
accuracy. We will also test whether the biomarker signature predicts pain severity (on a 0-10 scale) and pain
duration (number of days until pain resolves). We will use multiple statistical approaches to optimize and test the
performance of the predictive biomarker. In the R33 phase we then aim to perform initial clinical validation to
determine whether the optimized PAF/CME biomarker signature predicts pain severity and duration in patients
with new onset myofascial temporomandibular disorder (TMD; n=30). We expect our work to result in the delivery
of a candidate biomarker signature ready for advanced prospective clinical validation studies."
10897993,"Mechanisms of Protective!Immunity after Dengue Natural Infections and Vaccination
OVERALL P01
SUMMARY
The four dengue virus serotypes (DENV1-4) cause the most important mosquito-borne viral disease of humans,
with 100 million cases annually. The mechanisms by which the host immune response to DENV provides either
protection against or enhancement of a subsequent infection with a different DENV serotype are not fully
understood, and this has been a major concern in vaccine development and implementation. The poor results
of the first registered dengue live attenuated vaccine highlight the critical need to better understand the immune
response to natural DENV infections and vaccine candidates and to identify robust correlates of protection. Our
current Program Project has been very successful, generating >50 high-level publications in 3.5 years and
producing key findings that are timely, topical, and impactful. Here, we propose to identify immune
mechanisms responsible for outcomes of DENV infection and vaccination, comprehensively exploring
both the antigenic specificity and Fc functionality of antibodies as well as the quality of T cell responses
in the context of long-term ongoing clinical and epidemiological studies of natural DENV infections and
vaccines. We integrate classical cutting-edge molecular genetic and systems serology approaches to
systematically examine both antigen specificity and Fc characteristics and effector functions of antibodies, as
well as T cell attributes, that predict protection or pathogenesis. We propose a coordinated P01 Program that
includes four projects: 1) Quality of B Cell and Antibody Responses to Natural Dengue Virus Infections; 2)
Dengue Vaccines: Linking Vaccine-Induced Antibody Responses to Protective or Disease-Enhancing Immunity;
3) Quality of T Cell Responses Following Dengue Virus Natural Infections and Live-Attenuated Dengue Virus
Vaccination, and 4) Genetic and Structural Basis for Human Antibody Inhibition of Dengue Viruses. The P01
is highly synergistic in that samples from the same individuals, as well as specific assays, reagents and
methodologies, are shared among the Projects, which are supported by an Administrative Core, Computational
Biology and Statistical Modeling Core, and Clinical and Data Management Core. We will leverage unique
sample sets from the longest continuous cohort study of dengue, in Nicaragua, as well as a cohort study
following recipients of the Dengvaxia® vaccine in the Philippines and human challenge studies of the NIH live
attenuated vaccine. We have have expanded our existing P01 Consortium of world-renowned investigators with
extensive experience and on-going programs in dengue clinical, immunological, and virological research and
vaccine development – thus ensuring a continued high-quality successful research program. All the partners
have a long-standing record of collaboration and numerous joint publications (>225). The Specific Aims
are: 1) Define the antigenic repertoire and Fc characteristics of antibodies that predict outcome of subsequent
DENV infection as well as the long-term humoral immune response; 2) Link vaccine-induced antibody responses
to specific outcomes such as protection, vaccine failure and vaccine-primed severe disease; 3) Demonstrate
that quality of T cell responses influences the clinical outcomes of infection and vaccination and modulates the
quantity and quality of B cell responses; 4) Comprehensively define the protective antigenic landscape of
DENV1-3 type-specific as well as DENV cross-reactive monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. The
overarching premise is that the accumulation of immunologic data from natural DENV infections, vaccine
cohorts, and human challenge studies, coupled with state-of-the-art computational modeling and data
integration, will enable identification of new immune correlates that predict protective immunity or immune
enhancement, providing critical metrics for evaluating existing and second-generation DENV vaccines."

Overall
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are emerging as a major public health problem in North Carolina
(NC) and across the US. PFAS comprise a class of almost 5,000 known compounds. Their unique chemical
properties have been harnessed to make consumer and industrial products more water, stain, and grease
resistant; they are found in products as diverse as cosmetics and firefighting foams. Despite increasing
evidence that they are found ubiquitously in the environment, there is a paucity of knowledge about their
toxicity. For the few well-studied PFAS, associated health effects include cancer and toxicity to the liver, thyroid,
and immune system; but human exposure levels, mechanisms of action, bioaccumulation, or effective
remediation approaches remain unclear for the majority of PFAS. As a result of recent widespread detection in
the environment and increasing evidence of human exposure we propose to establish a Superfund Research
Program (SRP) Center for Environmental and Human Health Effects of PFAS. Several of these
compounds are included on the Substance Priority List of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease
Registry and are considered contaminants of emerging concern by the US Environmental Protection Agency.
The long-term objective of our Center is to advance understanding about PFAS 1) environmental and
human exposure in impacted areas, 2) toxicity and underlying mechanisms of thyroid and immune
function, 3) bioaccumulation potential, and 4) remediation. To meet our objective we will employ a highly
transdisciplinary approach that will integrate leaders in diverse fields (epidemiology, environmental science
and engineering, biology, toxicology, immunology, data science, and advanced analytics) across two major
NC Universities (NC State and East Carolina Universities); multiple levels of biological organization
(biomolecule, pathway, cell, model organisms (periphyton, mayflies, zebrafish, mouse), and human
populations); state-of-the-art analytical technologies; cutting-edge data science and management
approaches; a recognized track record in interdisciplinary, environmental health science training; and
well-established partnerships with government and community stakeholders. We aim to be a trusted
resource for SRP stakeholders and impacted communities and to catalyze discovery of information that leads
to prevention of PFAS exposure and protection of human health."

This application for a Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) would initiate a formal Center to lead,
support, and expand neuroimaging and clinical cognitive neuroscience research in Nebraska, with an emphasis
on lifespan development. It is an opportune moment for human neuroscience research in the Omaha community,
regionally, and across the world, with many new research tools and government initiatives intended to illuminate
the next frontier of biomedicine. The proposed Cognitive Neuroscience of Development and Aging (CONDA)
Center will provide critical resources and support to faculty from four institutions: the University of Nebraska
Medical Center (UNMC), the Boys Town National Research Hospital, the University of Nebraska – Omaha, and
Creighton University. The Administrative Core of the CONDA Center will be housed at UNMC, which is less than
two miles from each of the other institutions, and will be comprised of Training, Evaluation, Engagement,
Administration, and Mentoring areas (i.e., the TEEAM Core). The new CONDA Center will also include a state-
of-the-art Neuroimaging Acquisition and Analysis Core, as well as extensive support for four primary COBRE
research projects led by a promising group of NIH-defined early-stage investigators. Upon initiation of the Center,
the TEEAM Core would immediately implement a series of new programs that are designed to develop human
cognitive neuroscience on the CONDA Campus and across the region. The TEEAM Core would also rapidly
implement a comprehensive research support structure that includes the Neuroimaging Core facility, training
opportunities, pilot projects and mini-grants programs, a new seminar series, postdoctoral fellowships, intern-
ships for growing temporary and long-term laboratory staffing, and a participant registry to enhance recruitment.
In parallel, the TEEAM Core would promote the successful launch of the primary COBRE research projects and,
through a mentoring network approach, implement a career development and evaluation support system to
monitor progress and ensure Junior PIs and their mentoring teams reach critical milestones. As per the new
research core, the Neuroimaging Acquisition and Analysis Core facility would be the only core dedicated to
human brain research in the state of Nebraska, and would provide regional scientists with state-of-the-art tools
for neuroimaging and neuromodulation, including research-dedicated MRI and MEG systems. The new Center
would also receive exceptional institutional support, including financial support for CONDA programs, major
equipment expenses, and Core staffing. The overall CONDA team includes an established group of PIs in neuro-
imaging, brain dynamics, aging, and brain and cognitive development, as well as a strong cohort of emerging
junior investigators using innovative cognitive and affective neuroscience methods to address major questions
in human neuroscience across the lifespan. These junior scientists were all hired in the past three years, and this
new wealth of concentrated local expertise has primed us for a trajectory of accelerated development of neuro-
science and neuroimaging toward national prominence, an aim for which the new CONDA Center will be integral."
10836485,"PROGRAM INTRODUCTION SUMMARY:
This is the re-submission of a new Program Project (HL146373-01) that we have re-named
“Studies of Physiologic and Pathologic Platelet Plug Formation” to more accurately reflect the
topics the Program Project addresses. In addition to forming hemostatic plugs at sites of
vascular injury, platelets make important contributions to processes such as inflammation,
tissue regeneration, host defense, angiogenesis, lymphatic development, and tumor metastasis.
Pathologic platelet thrombi are also responsible for much of the morbidity and mortality of
arterial vascular disease. There remain large gaps in our understanding of physiologic and
pathologic platelet function. Building upon our collective scientific accomplishments, we address
these gaps using the cell-biologic, structural-biologic, and computational-biologic methods we
have developed. The Program Project we propose consists of four projects and one
administrative core unit. All of the projects are based at the Perelman School of Medicine of the
University of Pennsylvania. Three projects are based in the Hematology-Oncology Division of
the Department of Medicine; the fourth is based in the Division of Hematology of the
Department of Pediatrics at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Project 1, re-named “Novel
Roles for Phosphoinositide Signaling in α-Granule Biogenesis”, is based on the hypotheses that
phosphoinositide synthesis is an essential step in the loading of α-granules with components
synthesized in the Golgi and that megakaryocyte phosphoinositides play a previously
unrecognized role in the development of congenital megakaryocyte disorders. The objectives of
Project 2, entitled “Platelet Integrin Structure and Function”, are to use novel computational and
experimental techniques to compare the behavior of αIIbβ3 with that of the other integrins and
to identify and quantify the protein-protein interactions responsible for αIIbβ3-mediated fibrin clot
contraction. Project 3 is entitled “A Systems Approach to Hemostasis and Thrombosis“. The
goals of the studies proposed in this Project are to extend past analyses of platelet thrombus
formation and structure from the microvasculature to the macrovasculature, from mice to
humans, and from hemostasis to thrombosis. Project 4, entitled “Platelet Factor 4 and Heparin
in NETosis and Sepsis”, will test the hypothesis that NETs, neutrophil extracellular traps
composed of chromatin released by neutrophils, require partial digestion and release of DNA
and histones to be toxic during sepsis. Because infused platelet factor 4, as well as the
monoclonal antibody KKO that binds to the complex of platelet factor 4 and heparin, block DNA
digestion, both will be protective in sepsis. The four projects are supported by a single core unit
that provides for the common administrative needs of the Program."
10771283,"ABSTRACT: THE UNC-CHAPEL HILL SUPERFUND RESEARCH PROGRAM
The interdisciplinary Superfund Research Program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-SRP)
will address serious public health challenges faced by communities in North Carolina (NC) and across the nation
related to inorganic arsenic (iAs). The UNC-SRP prioritizes iAs as the focus contaminant as it is highly relevant
to millions in NC and the US exposed to unsafe levels. In NC, contamination is derived from both geogenic
sources and industrial activities (e.g. superfund sites and coal ash contamination) polluting thousands of private
wells. An estimated ~3 million individuals in NC, representing one third of the state’s population, drink water from
private wells, with iAs ranging up to 800 ppb. These populations are largely located in the rural areas of NC with
established environmental justice conditions. Moreover, iAs contamination reverberates across the state and is
locally and nationally-relevant. Related to public health risk, exposure to iAs has been established to be
associated with metabolic dysfunction/diabetes. There is a significant gap in the knowledge of factors that drive
iAs-induced diabetes risk. The identification of these factors would facilitate development of novel
solutions/interventions to reduce the prevalence of iAs-associated diabetes, as well as other diseases associated
with iAs exposure. Our unique scientific theme is “Identifying novel methods to reduce iAs exposure and
elucidating mechanisms underlying iAs-induced metabolic dysfunction with a vision for disease
prevention.” We address this with three aims: (1) Discover biological mechanisms and susceptibility factors
underlying iAs-associated metabolic dysfunction/diabetes; (2) Develop novel methods and technologies to
predict iAs contamination and reduce iAs exposure; (3) Translate the science of the UNC-SRP to key
stakeholders in NC and the larger SRP program, and engage vulnerable communities. The UNC-SRP comprises
five research projects. Projects 1-3 use highly translational techniques spanning in vitro and in vivo models, and
human populations to understand mechanisms of iA-induced diabetes. Projects 4-5 advance the ability to predict
iAs contamination in private drinking wells and innovative methods for enhanced removal of iAs. With relevance
to the national SRP program, we will work with site managers at the Fairfax St. Wood Treaters Superfund site.
Five Cores include the Administrative Core, the Community Engagement Core, Data management and Analysis
Core (DMAC), Research Experience and Training Coordination Core (RETCC), and Chemistry and Analysis
Core (CAC). These Cores facilitate administration, community engagement with our partners Clean Water for
NC and the Winyah Rivers Foundation, data management and analysis, training, and chemical analyses. In sum,
the UNC-SRP mission is to develop new solutions for iAs reduction and disease prevention through
mechanistic and translational research to ultimately inform regulation and Superfund site cleanup efforts."

Lack of progress in curing metastatic breast cancer is due to a number of fundamental treatment barriers. These
include insufficient knowledge of therapeutic vulnerabilities, lack of reliable predictive biomarkers, inability to
target common tumor suppressor gene loss, inability to target oncogenes that are not protein kinases or ligand-
dependent transcription factors, resistance due to clonal evolution and tumor heterogeneity, and failure to mount
an immune response against the tumor. This SPORE renewal focuses on these obstacles by articulating cross-
cutting objectives and aligned approaches that increase the efficiency of core utilization and promote inter-project
collaboration. The three full Projects include studies on how to target the derepressed kinases consequent upon
loss of the PTPN12 or the NF1 tumor suppressors in breast cancer, and the development of a promising new
therapeutic approach for MYC-positive breast cancer. During the execution of these Projects we will: a) deploy
proteogenomic approaches for monitoring kinase targets and resistance pathways; b) establish high-quality
biomarkers for clinical trial eligibility and stratification; c) investigate disease-monitoring approaches with
circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA); d) incorporate immunological approaches
into treatment regimens by increasing the quality and quantity of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes; e) embed our
SPORE biomarker program into early phase clinical trials to inform the design of Phase 3 trials; and f) promote
collaborative research between Academia, NCI-Supported Cooperative Groups, Industry, and Advocacy
Groups.
These objectives are served by three reformatted Cores, with the addition of a dedicated and highly-qualified
molecular research pathologist for the Pathology and Biobanking Core, the addition of deeper bioinformatics
expertise to the Informatics and Biostatistics Core, and a new SPORE director plus additional advocates and
advisory board members for the Administration Core. The Career Enhancement and Developmental Research
Programs will be guided by highly experienced leadership and, as before, will cement the future of our SPORE.
With this powerful enhanced program we will advocate nationally for progress in the treatment of advanced
breast cancer, with the conviction that a cure is a near-term possibility."

The overall goal of this program is to improve outcomes in the treatment of human leukemias with more
effective and less toxic therapies. We have made significant progress during the previous funding period in
understanding the genetic basis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), developing more effective treatments for
human leukemias, and validating predictors of therapeutic response. Pre-clinical and clinical studies from Drs.
Griffin and Stone, funded by this P01, contributed directly to the FDA-approval of midostaurin for FLT3-mutant
AML during the last funding period. Work from Dr. Letai, funded by this P01, contributed directly to FDA-
approval of venetoclax for AML during the last funding period, to the demonstration that apoptotic priming
predicts response to therapy in leukemia. Work from Dr. Ebert, funded by this P01, elucidated the mechanism
of action of lenalidomide and its analogs, leading to widespread drug development in academia and the private
sector focused on protein degradation. And work from Dr. Armstrong, funded by this P01, led to a clinical trial
of a DOT1L inhibitor with evidence of response in AML. In this renewal, we propose studies to continue this
record of therapeutic development for leukemia, leveraging a sample bank, a clinical and genetic database, a
xenograft bank, and a team of laboratory and clinical investigators with a long and successful track record of
collaborative research. Specifically, we will investigate apoptotic priming and prediction of response to
targeted AML therapies in Project 1 (Dr. Letai); the targeting of CBL-mediated signaling and ubiquitin ligase
activity in Project 2 (Dr. Ebert); the modulation of the SALL4B transcription factor in Project 3 (Drs. Tenen,
Chai, and Qi); and the biology and therapeutic targeting of zinc finger transcription factors in Project 4 (Drs.
Armstrong and Fischer). Projects 2, 3, and 4 all focus on the modulation of ubiquitin ligase activity to develop
candidate therapeutics (Projects 3 and 4) or understand leukemia biology (Project 2). The team will use a
common set of drugs, assays, and model systems. All projects will characterize mutations in primary samples
using the Rapid Heme Panel, will test molecules in vitro using dynamic BH3 profiling with Dr. Letai (Project 1),
and will use a common set of xenografts. All projects will interact with Drs. Stone and Deangelo, leading
leukemia clinical investigators, to move candidate therapeutics into high impact clinical trials with deep
correlative studies. In aggregate, these studies will provide insights into leukemia biology, develop highly novel
therapeutic strategies, and lead to the advancements in the treatment of AML."
10767853,"Project Summary:
The preterm birth rate in Harris County, Houston, TX is an alarming 13.6% (national average in US is
9.6%), and in areas surrounding the superfund sites, the preterm birth (PTB) rate is even higher (> 20%).
There are 15 superfund sites in Harris County, posing a significant health risk to people living in the
vicinity of these sites. Preterm birth (PTB) often leads to many complications including chronic lung
disease, also termed bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and some of these patients develop
neurocognitive deficits later in life. One of the possible risk factors for PTBs are polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs), present in contaminated soil, sediments, and water at various superfund sites
across the US, including the greater Houston area. The over-arching hypothesis of the BCM-Rice SRP
is that maternal exposure to PAHs, which are present in superfund sites, increases the risk of PTBs and
incrementally augments major morbidities such as BPD and neurocognitive deficits. The Specific Aims
of the overall center are: 1. To develop ultrasensitive detection and identification strategies (e.g., surface-
enhanced Raman Spectra (SERA) and surface-enhanced Infrared Absorption spectroscopy (SEIRA) for
primary and secondary PAH-based compounds in air, water, and soil based on optically active
engineered nanomaterials (project 1). This method is highly innovative and because it can detect PAHs
at 1 ppb levels, it will be very helpful for risk assessment. 2. To determine molecular mechanisms by
which maternal exposure to PAH mixtures increases the risks for PTBs, which in turn leads to BPD and
neurocognitive deficits. 3. To develop novel remediation technologies to treat sediments from Superfund
sites in a manner that completely removes the health risks while adding value to the impacted media.
This research should help in risk assessment. 4. To develop novel strategies to prevent and reduce the
health burden associated with PAHs present in superfund sites (e.g., Patrick Bayou, San Jacinto waste
Pitts) through our Community Engagement Core (CEC). 5. To develop partnerships with primary
stakeholders (i.e. EPA, ATSDR), NIEHS, investigators within the center and other centers, to explore
commercialization possibilities through the Administrative and Research Translational Core (AC). 6.
Train students and postdoctoral fellows in a cross-disciplinary manner, so next generation scientists,
engineers, and physicians will make fundamental contributions to Environmental Health [Research
Experience and Training Coordination Core (RETCC)]. 7. To support the management and integration
of assets across all the projects and cores of the center [data management and Analysis core (DMAC)].
The biomedical and environmental Science projects are well integrated, and they will be supported by
the AC, the research support core (RSC), and the DMAC. The overall goal to reduce the health burden
associated with PAHs in superfund sites."

Our understanding of the neuropathology in Alzheimer’s disease is crude and largely centered on characteristic
deposition of a few pathological proteins. Catalyzed by the BRAIN Initiative, a new generation of molecular tools
to characterize the transcriptome, epigenome and spatial organization of single cells in complex brain tissues is
rapidly revolutionizing our understanding of the diversity of cell types and their selective genetic profiles. These
tools are applicable to postmortem human brain tissues and promise to expand our understanding of the core
cellular and molecular correlates and mechanisms underlying Alzheimer’s disease. The goal of the proposed
Center is to bring together experts in Alzheimer’s disease research and large-scale molecular/anatomical brain
mapping to modernize Alzheimer’s disease tissue banking methods, and to combine traditional and quantitative
neuropathology with emerging single nucleus transcriptomics, single nucleus epigenomics and spatial
transcriptomics technologies. Applied to clinically typical Alzheimer’s cases of varying severity in an iterative and
adaptive design, these techniques are expected to identify increasingly refined molecular pathways associated
with specific neuronal and non-neuronal cell types and yield valuable insights into cell-type selective vulnerability
or resistance to pathology. This increased resolution of AD pathology in terms of cell types and molecular
pathways should provide mechanistic insights and hypotheses on disease initiation and progression, which we
aim to use to catalyze the AD research community through the creation of an open access data resource linked
with other large-scale brain mapping efforts. This Center framework is designed to be extensible to additional
data modalities and technological advances as well as broader cohorts representing Alzheimer’s disease
subtypes and Alzheimer’s disease related disorders in the future."
10747910,"Project Summary
 The Center for Open Bioimage Analysis will serve the cell biology community’s growing need for
sophisticated software for light microscopy image analysis. Quantitative image analysis has become an
indispensable tool for biologists using microscopy throughout basic biological and biomedical research.
 Quantifying images is now a critical, widespread need as imaging experiments continue to grow in scale,
size, dimensionality, scope, modality, and complexity. Many biologists are missing out on the quantitative
bioimaging revolution due to lack of effective algorithms and/or usable software for their needs, or lack of
access to training. The Center brings together the Carpenter laboratory at the Broad Institute and the Eliceiri
laboratory at the University of Wisconsin­Madison, and in doing so brings together the two most popular open
source bioimage analysis projects, ImageJ (including ImageJ2 and FIJI) and CellProfiler. Through the
collaborative development and dissemination of open source image analysis software, as well as training
events and resources, the Center will empower thousands of researchers to apply advanced analytics in
innovative ways to address new experimental areas.
 Building on the team’s expertise developing algorithms and user­friendly software for use in biology under
real­world conditions, the Center will focus on two Technology Research and Development (TR&D) projects:
deep learning­based image processing, and accessibility of image­processing algorithms for biologists. This
work will not occur in isolation at the Center; rather, the Center will nucleate a larger community working on
these two areas and serve as a catalyst and organizing force to create software and resources shared by all.
 The Driving Biological Projects (DBPs) will serve a major role in driving the TR&D work: our teams are
accustomed to working deeply and iteratively on problems side by side and with frequent feedback from
biologists. This will ensure that important cell biological problems drive the work of the Center. The DBPs
reflect tremendous variety in terms of biological questions, model systems, imaging modalities, and researcher
expertise and will ensure robustness of our tools for the widest possible impact on the community. Continuing
the teams’ track record with ImageJ and CellProfiler, two mature open source bioimage analysis software
projects critical to the work of biologists worldwide, the Center will also assist and train biologists in applying
the latest computational techniques to important biological problems involving images.
 In short, the need for robust, accurate, and readily usable software is more urgent than ever. The Center for
Open Bioimage Analysis will serve as a hub for pioneering new computational strategies for diverse biological
problems, translating them into user­friendly software, further developing ImageJ and CellProfiler, and training
the biological community to apply advanced software to important and diverse problems in cell biology."
9838126,"Background: Value is defined as health outcomes achieved per dollar spent over a cycle of care. Heart
failure (HF) is an ideal condition for which to study value because 1 of 10 Veterans dies and 1 in 5 is
readmitted within 30 days of discharge. “Home time,” defined as the time a patient spends alive and outside of
health care institutions, is a novel outcome measure that is highly-prioritized among Veterans with HF. Yet
variations in the value of care delivered by VA facilities during HF care episodes are unknown.
 A significant proportion of facility-level variations in value is likely explained by variations in the
implementation of key care processes in the transition from HF hospitalization: HF medication optimization,
early follow-up after discharge, and education regarding HF self-management. Yet gaps in VA HF transitional
care persist: 2 of 3 Veterans eligible for guideline-recommended HF medications are not prescribed them, 2 of
3 do not attend a follow-up appointment within 7 days of discharge, and 2 of 5 feel ill-equipped in managing
their disease process. How high-functioning VA facilities (with high home time and low costs) successfully
deliver HF transitional care and social-organizational factors influencing practice adoption are unknown.
 There is a need to test implementation strategies to establish HF transitional care practices. Facilitation is a
strategy whereby skilled individuals work with key stakeholders to select evidence-based practices and
implementation strategies, adapt them to the local context, and assist in intervention implementation. Audit
and feedback can complement facilitation by providing data on whether intervention and implementation goals
are being achieved and stimulating appropriate intervention and implementation adaptations. However, the
feasibility of using facilitation and audit and feedback to enhance adoption of evidence-based practices related
to HF transitional care at low-functioning VA facilities (with low home time and high costs) is unknown.
Significance: This proposal supports the vision of VA leadership by studying health care value improvement
and implementation strategies to support care coordination of chronic diseases at facilities with low quality of
care. It has the potential to improve rates of mortality and readmission after HF discharge (key SAIL metrics).
Innovation: Novelty in Aim 1 centers on the application of the value framework to HF transitional care and the
focus on home time. Novelty in Aim 2 revolves around characterizing evidence-based practices related to HF
transitional care, how they were implemented, and factors influencing their implementation within the context
and culture of the VA. Novelty in Aim 3 lies in the use of facilitation and audit and feedback to implement an
evidence-based intervention for patients with a complex chronic disease at low-functioning facilities.
Specific Aims: 1. Value Assessment: In a national cohort of Veterans hospitalized with HF, assess facility-
level variations in guideline-concordant HF transitional care, risk-adjusted home time and risk-standardized
costs of care within 90 days of discharge and the association between guideline-concordant care and value.
2. Context Assessment: Conduct multi-level informant interviews at outlier facilities (4 high-performing, 2
intermediate-performing, and 2 low-performing) to characterize evidence-based practices shown to work in VA
context, how they were implemented, and social-organizational factors influencing practice adoption.
3. Implementation Feasibility: Pilot-test facilitation and audit and feedback as strategies to implement an
intervention consisting of evidence-based HF transitional care practices observed to work in VA context in Aim
2 at 2 low-performing facilities and assess the intervention’s implementation, reach, and cost.
Methodologies: The above aims will be achieved by means of value measurement and health economics
(Aim 1), qualitative interviewing methods (Aim 2), and implementation and dissemination science (Aim 3).
Next Step: We will perform a type III implementation-effectiveness hybrid trial at a wider array of facilities to
compare the effect sizes and costs of audit and feedback versus facilitation combined with audit and feedback."
10893306,"OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY
In this Program Project renewal application, the applicant group is representative of three primary institutions,
The Ohio State University (OSU), the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), and the University of North Carolina
at Greensboro (UNCG). The participants have combined their vast experience in the isolation, structure
elucidation, and biological evaluation of natural products, to the development of a consolidated, integrated
program for the discovery of novel anticancer agents of diverse origin for development as cancer
chemotherapeutic agents. Plant materials to be studied in Project 1 (OSU) will be collected by established
botanists located in tropical countries with the assistance of the NAPRALERT database (Project 2; UIC), and
lichens and their fungal associates (Project 1), cyanobacteria (Project 2) and filamentous fungi (Project 3;
UNCG) will also be accessed. Organisms acquired will be extracted and evaluated in a diverse battery of relevant
mechanism-based, cell-based, and tumor-growth related assays currently operational at OSU (Project 1), UIC
(Core 1), Columbia University (through Project 3), and via other external collaborators (through Core A at OSU).
Dereplication of known active compounds will be accomplished at OSU, UIC, and UNCG using computerized
literature surveys and LC-MS coupled to bioassays. Bioassay-directed fractionation will be employed in Projects
1-3 for the elucidation of the active principles. Lead development of active natural products via medicinal
chemistry and pharmacokinetics-related studies will be conducted at OSU (Core 2), facilitated by the OSU
Biostatistics group (Core A). Novel, active compounds thus discovered will be further evaluated in our panel of
in vitro and in vivo bioassays (Projects 1 and 3, Core A, and some external collaborators). Group decisions will
be made regarding the further development of agents for potential use as anticancer agents. The more advanced
stages of biological and toxicological testing will be aided through consultation with the Drug Discovery Institute
of the OSU Comprehensive Cancer Center (through Core A). The Consortium will work with the involvement of
the NCI Program Official in the discovery process, and plans to hold regular meetings of key scientific personnel
(inclusive of our External and OSU Internal Scientific Advisory Boards) to enhance communication and decision-
making processes, to be organized by Core A. Excellent facilities for the isolation, structure determination,
chemical modification, synthesis, and in vitro and in vivo biological evaluation, and overall project data
management are available. The overarching goal of this P01 is to identify lead compounds that ultimately have
therapeutic value for the treatment of cancer."
10772141,"Limited mobility due to conditions like osteoarthritis (OA), cerebral palsy, and Parkinson’s disease affects
millions of individuals, at enormous personal and societal cost. Rehabilitation can dramatically improve mobility
and function, but current rehabilitation practice requires in-person guidance by a skilled clinician, increasing
expense and limiting access. Mobile sensing technologies are now ubiquitous and have the potential to
measure patient function and guide treatment outside the clinic, but they currently fail to capture the
characteristics of motion required to accurately monitor function and customize treatment. Millions of low-cost
mobile sensors are generating terabytes of data that could be analyzed in combination with other data, such as
images, clinical records, and video, to enable studies of unprecedented scale, but machine learning models for
analyzing these large-scale, heterogeneous, time-varying data are lacking.
 To address these challenges, we will establish a Biomedical Technology Resource Center —The Mobilize
Center. Through the leadership of an experienced scientific team, we will create and disseminate innovative
tools to quantify movement biomechanics with mobile sensors.
 Specifically, we will:
 1. Push the bounds of what we can measure via wearable sensors using models that compute muscle
 and joint forces and metabolic cost of locomotion. These models, based on biomechanical and machine
 learning models, will be disseminated via our newly created OpenSense software, which will be used
 by thousands of researchers to gain new insights into patient biomechanics using mobile sensors.
 2. Meet the need for tools that analyze data about movement dynamics and develop machine learning
 models to analyze and generate insights from unstructured, high-dimensional data, including time-
 series (e.g., from mobile sensors), images (e.g., MRI), and video (e.g., smartphone video of a patient’s
gait).
 3. Provide tools needed to intervene in the real-world. We will develop algorithms to accurately quantify
 kinematics outside the lab for long durations using data from inertial measurement units (IMUs). We will
 also build behavioral models to adapt and personalize goal setting, drawing on movement records from
 6 million individuals, as well as health goals and exercise for 1.7 million people.
 Through intensive interactions with our Collaborative Projects, we will focus on improving rehabilitation
outcomes for individuals with limited mobility due to osteoarthritis, obesity, Parkinson’s disease, and cerebral
palsy. The Center’s tools and services will enable researchers to revolutionize how we diagnose, monitor, and
treat mobility disorders, providing tools needed to deliver precision rehabilitation at low cost and on a massive
scale in the future."
10911979,"ABSTRACT – P01, Clinical Care Gaps and Unmet Needs in AYA Cancer Survivors
 This program of research focuses on cancer care and outcomes for people diagnosed with cancer
during the adolescent and young adult (AYA) age range, from 15 to 39 years old. The clinical care and long-
term surveillance of this population of individuals are understudied despite their unique needs. Unlike younger
and older populations, individuals in the AYA age range go through major life transitions, from moving out of
the childhood home and seeking employment or higher education, to establishing a career and family. A
cancer diagnosis in the context of these life transitions presents challenges that are unique or particularly
acute. In the healthcare context, AYAs may lack of continuity of care as they transition from pediatric or
adolescent specialists to adult specialists. Fertility preservation strategies are unique to cancer patients
diagnosed as AYAs, as recommended options are available only after puberty and through child-bearing age.
As many AYAs are at the early stages of their careers, financial concerns are exacerbated with a cancer
diagnosis and its treatment, and care may be fragmented across varying providers. Thus, for AYAs,
coordination of care for cancer and other conditions may be suboptimal, influencing late effects of the cancer
or its treatment, and neglecting the concerns of AYA cancer survivors. We propose three projects, aligned
along the cancer care continuum, to improve our knowledge about the best care for AYA cancer survivors.
Project 1 focuses on fertility concerns and use of reproductive health services and their impact on cancer
treatment. Project 2 focuses on care transitions from active cancer treatment to surveillance and ancillary
services in the period 2 to 5 years after diagnosis. Project 3 documents medical conditions and late effects
that occur in AYA cancer survivors and identifies factors that influence likelihood of developing these
conditions. Each project aims to determine the best approaches to care in their area of focus, to improve
outcomes and better address patient needs. These projects are supported by three cores, an Administrative
Core, a Biostatistics and Data Harmonization Shared Resource, and a Survey Shared Resource. Population
and data resources in this P01 include: the University of North Carolina Cancer Information & Population
Health Resource with a state cancer registry linked to health claims; the California Cancer Registry linked to
statewide hospitalization, emergency department, and ambulatory surgery data; the Utah Population Database
with data similar to that from California; and the integrated healthcare settings of Kaiser Permanente Northern
and Southern California. These data provide the opportunity to examine care from multiple providers in varied
settings and will be complemented by a survey of 5,000 AYA cancer patients to include patient perspectives as
we address our research goals. The multidisciplinary, collaborative research team includes epidemiologists,
health services researchers, biostatisticians, pediatric and adult oncologists, and AYA cancer survivors. This
research will advance knowledge to improve the care and outcomes of AYA cancer patients and survivors."

10884235,"Abstract: Overall. Computation plays a critical role in biomolecular applications of nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy (NMR), such as structural biology, metabolic studies, disease diagnosis, and drug
discovery. Powerful software packages from a variety of sources facilitate computation in bio-NMR, but
challenges include the difficulty of disseminating and maintaining a diverse set of software for a diverse set of
computer platforms, communication between software packages, and the lack of persistence of software. The
aim of this proposal is support continued operation of a Center for NMR Data Processing and Analysis that will
simplify dissemination, support, and use of a broad range of widely-used NMR data processing and analysis
software packages. Central components of the project include the use of virtualization technology to provide a
“zero configuration” software environment that requires no configuration on the part of users. It will run on
almost any computer platform and simplify both dissemination and maintenance. An archive will ensure
software persistence that is essential for reproducible research. The Center will establish a publically
accessible website for discovery, evaluation, and access to a diverse set of NMR software, and will develop
tools for interoperation among software packages. In addition to a single, unified downloadable package, the
platform will be made available for remote access, as a Platform as a Service (PaaS). By facilitating the
deployment, utilization, interoperation, and persistence of advanced software for biomolecular NMR, the
resource will advance the application of biomolecular NMR for a wide range of challenging applications in
biomedicine, and help ensure the reproducibility of bio-NMR studies.

10783690,"PROGRAM TITLE: Determinants of Liver Metastasis
PROGRAM ABSTRACT
Liver metastasis indicates a terminal illness for many cancers and is a leading cause of cancer death in the
United States. There is currently no integrated research program devoted to mechanisms of liver metastasis.
While common in certain cancer types (such as pancreas and colon), metastasis is less common but highly
malignant in other cancer types (such as prostate cancer). The long-term goal of our Program is to
understand and address the shared and unique drivers of liver metastasis in colon, pancreas, and
prostate primary tumor types. Published work and preliminary data from the four integrated projects point to
key roles for four critical molecular signaling axes in mediating liver metastasis, through mechanisms likely
common across many primary tumor types. To complement this mechanistic expertise, this Program assembles
clinical expertise across different tumor types and liver microenvironment models.
Together, this collaborative Program investigates the hypothesis that normal liver tissue is inherently suppressive
of metastatic tumor expansion, unless alterations in the liver microenvironment result in the loss of metastatic
suppressors. Project 1 explores the acquisition of features that enable metastasis from circulating saturated fat
and subsequent endoglin signaling in hepatocytes and cancer epithelia. The pro-metastatic impact of hepatic
stellate cell (HSC)-derived hyaluronic acids in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is examined in Project 2. Thought
to activate pro-cancer phenotypes of HSCs and macrophages, Project 3 investigates the regulation and
contribution of yes-associated protein (YAP) and downstream signaling pathways to create a pro-metastatic liver
microenvironment. Project 4 investigates the roles of methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) proteins in liver
metastasis, from the loss of protective MAT1A to the pro-cancer elevated expression of MAT2A and MAT2B. By
examining these four intersecting signaling pathways and comparing findings across models, this Program will
augment current understanding of factors in the liver microenvironment and tumor that permit the development
of liver metastases.
This Program unites essential expertise in the fields of liver and cancer pathobiology to represent the first multi-
investigator effort focused on common mechanisms involved in liver metastasis from disparate tumor models
(prostate, colon, and pancreas). The Program adopts a unique approach, investigating the role of the normal
liver microenvironment and leveraging each project team’s substantial expertise along with essential resources,
including pharmacologic means of addressing the signaling axes, partnerships with healthcare providers to
validate the findings in animal models through human tissue specimens, and innovative technology to isolate
and analyze metastatic factors including circulating tumor cells and extracellular vesicles. Successful completion
of the Program will establish new paradigms in liver metastasis and test novel therapeutic strategies."

10819475,"The genetic lesions that promote tumorigenesis, including chromosomal rearrangements, are generated
primarily by illegitimate DNA repair. In this renewal application, we will continue to investigate the pathological
consequences of aberrant DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. This highly collaborative and integrated
program will elucidate how DNA sequence, chromatin accessibility and nuclear organization influence the fate
and pathological outcomes of DSBs in a cell type and cell cycle dependent manner. We will continue to use a
combination of genetics in yeast and mouse models, biochemistry and cell biology. The application of next
generation technologies together with high-throughput genomics approaches provides an unprecedented wealth
of information about genomic instability in cancer genomes. We propose to leverage our multifaceted
experimental approach with the strong genomics and computational biology components that pervade the
Program. Drs. Rabadan and Baer will study mutation signatures - the statistically enriched patterns of DNA
substitutions and rearrangements common across tumors - associated with specific BRCA1 deficiencies. They
will also characterize mutation signatures generated by the other three Projects. Collectively these data will help
deconvolute the complex mutational landscape of human tumors. Drs. Symington and Ciccia will address the
nature of the initiating DNA lesions resulting in chromosome rearrangements, focusing on DNA replication errors
in repair-deficient yeast and genome-edited mammalian cells. Dr. Sha will connect chromatin accessibility, locally
and globally, with its propensity to break and yield translocations; pathological translocations at the
immunoglobulin and T cell receptor loci during lymphocyte maturation fuel lymphoma development. Specifically,
Dr. Zha will elucidate how ATM deficiencies favor translocations in a cell type and cell cycle dependent manner.
Finally, Drs. Gautier and Gottesman will study how the spatial organization of the nucleus modulates DNA repair.
Specifically, they will determine how nuclear actin and WASP, the gene mutated in Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome,
enables resection and influences chromosome translocations following DSBs or genotoxic lesions triggered by
topoisomerase inhibition. The four Projects will be supported by two scientific Cores. All leaders and co-leaders

10874626,"PROJECT SUMMARY – OVERALL
Inorganic chemistry plays myriad, evolutionarily-conserved roles in physiology and pathology. Cells must
accumulate several metals, such as zinc and iron, to millimolar levels in order to survive. They can deploy
fluctuations in metal content to control processes as varied as the mammalian cell cycle, pathogen infection
and neurological function. The critical regulatory role of metals is emphasized by the observation that one-third
of all protein-encoding genes in the human genome encode metal-dependent proteins. There is an increasing
appreciation in the NIH research community that intracellular content and subcellular location of each element
provides an inorganic signature that serves as a quantitative phenotype. These realizations are driving the
demand for new technologies for quantitative evaluation of inorganic signatures in cells and tissues. Such
methods are essential to understanding the regulation of physiological and pathogenic processes and
developmental decisions. The proposed Resource for Elemental Imaging for Life Sciences (QE-Map) will
develop and integrate emerging technologies to create transformative approaches to the compelling biological
question concerning inorganic chemistry in health and disease.
The technologies to be developed comprise a suite of three imaging and detection methods that will allow
investigators to quantitatively map the distribution of dozens of elements in samples ranging from cell extracts
to fixed cells to tissue slices. The complementary and integrative nature of these methods is critical to enabling
investigators to examine fluxes in intracellular ion content and localization, and to link these fluxes to changes
in distribution within tissues and in living animals. A multi-disciplinary team, located at Northwestern University
and Argonne National Laboratories, will address current limitations of LA-ICP-MS and SXFM technologies and
will launch the development of photoacoustic methods and probes to enable studies at the tissue level. We will
develop workflows and software that allows co-registration of images and standardization of quantitative data
that will maximize the impact and accelerate application to a broad range of biomedical research.
A portfolio of twelve DBPs was selected for their capacity to enable iterative development of new methods,
and address high impact research questions in the field of “inorganic physiology.” The DBPs focus on 4 themes:
(a) metal regulation in brain function and pathology; (b) metal modulation of host-pathogen interactions; (c)
metal fluxes controlling reproduction and development; and (d) metal imbalances in metabolic pathology.
A Community Engagement program will foster training of new technology users and dissemination of the
technologies to the scientific community. The integration and coordination of Resource projects and activities
will be enabled by the Administrative Core, co-directed by Drs. Thomas O’Halloran and Chris Jacobsen, and
supported by an External Advisory Committee and an Executive Committee."
10767330,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The University of Kentucky Superfund Research Center (UK-SRC) provides a focused, cross-disciplinary
research and training environment to address critical human health challenges associated with halogenated
organic substance exposures. Four center projects and five cores make up the proposed UK-SRC to further
develop research on lifestyle changes (e.g., nutrition and exercise) in addition to two environmental science
projects that will focus on the remediation and engineering solutions to this set of problems. Due to their
relative chemical stability and ubiquity in the environment, chlorinated organic contaminants such as
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and trichloroethylene (TCE) pose significant health risks and enduring
remediation challenges, including sites such as the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, the largest Superfund
site in Kentucky. The UK-SRC’s overall focus for this next cycle is the human health impacts of persistent
halogenated organics (e.g., PCBs, TCE, and tetrachloroethene (PCE), and in this new cycle of funding,
additional questions about per- and polyfluoralkyl substances (PFAS) will be incorporated. Projects covering
biomedical research hypothesize that healthy nutrition and exercise components provide a platform to develop
primary prevention strategies for diseases associated with environmental toxic insults, while also providing the
basis for new risk assessment paradigms. Further, novel iron-based, nano-structured sensing, capture and
remediation systems based on biomimetic binding domains and functionalized membrane platforms offer
potential for sustainable advances in technical capability for site remediation. The UK-SRC proposes the
following goals: 1) to expedite data-driven discovery as facilitated by the Data Management and Analysis Core
that will provide insight about biomarkers of exposures to generate new information about the relationship
between pollutant exposure, nutrient intake, physical activity and disease risk; 2) to better understand the
biochemical, molecular, and cellular mechanisms underlying the toxicity of halogenated organic compounds
(i.e., PCBs and PFAS) with a specific focus on chronic inflammatory diseases and windows of susceptibility; 3)
to foster informed decisions that expedite clean-up of halogenated organic compounds through advanced
material-based technologies, smart filters, and fate and transport science to reduce exposure risks; 4) to
promote and interdisciplinary approaches to environmental health science training that accelerate the impact of
complex solution-oriented, stakeholder-engaged research aimed at reducing exposures and improving human
health; and 5) to engage bi-directionally and provide environmental health programmatic activities to
vulnerable, socially-isolated, under-resourced communities in Kentucky, especially Eastern Kentucky (i.e.
Central Appalachia), where chronic inflammatory diseases exceed national averages and exposure risks to
environmental pollutants are prevalent. Activities will involve community engaged research and an innovative
means of integrating projects through the WHY-ENVIRONMENT initiative."
10764222,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Overall Core: Maier and Zhang)
The University of Arizona Superfund Research program (UA SRP) addresses the unique human health risks
encountered in the US Southwest, an area with a rich history and future of mining. The Southwest has distinct
geologic and climatic attributes that affect human health and exposures to pollution. Groundwater in Southwest
regions with rich ore deposits often has elevated arsenic levels, leading to exposure from drinking water.
Exposure also occurs by inhalation and ingestion of arsenic-associated mining dusts transported from mining
sites into the interior of homes and to exterior environments. Importantly, arsenic exposure has been linked to
the development of diabetes. Vulnerable populations residing near mining sites, including Native Americans and
Hispanic communities, exhibit increased incidence of diabetes. Our goal is to determine how chronic exposure
to mine wastes that contain arsenic contributes to the development of diabetes. We will then use this information
to help predict exposures and associated health outcomes as well as to inform public health prevention strategies
in communities that neighbor mine waste sites. To achieve this goal, we have five research projects and four
cores that will: 1) characterize how chronic mine waste arsenic exposure in mining impacted areas is linked to
diabetogenic outcomes through mediation of Nrf2 signaling; 2) determine how the gut microbiome and mining
waste mineral properties influence arsenic species transformation, bioavailability, and toxicity; 3) investigate the
influence of capping material quality on success of mine waste revegetation to enhance cap and plant
remediation technology; 4) model exposures to mining waste contaminants, accounting for socio-demographics,
to understand risk factors that drive development of diabetes; 5) mitigate the human impacts of exposure to
mining waste through effective interaction with stakeholders including regulators, the mining industry, and
affected communities; 6) serve as a global resource for human and environmental health issues associated with
metal mining; and 7) train and graduate professionals who are equipped to address complex 21st century
environmental hazardous waste problems (Aim 7). The expected outcome of this UA SRP effort is a measurable
reduction in diabetes (and other diseases) in mining communities and perhaps beyond."
10767858,"SUMMARY: Iowa Superfund Research Program Overall
The Iowa Superfund Research Program (ISRP) is a center of research excellence focused on polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCBs). PCBs were widely produced in the mid-20th century and used in thousands of products, from
common household items to construction materials, until the chemicals were banned 40 years ago. Today,
people are still exposed to PCBs indoors and in communities surrounding Superfund sites. Recent ISRP
research demonstrated that airborne PCBs present an especially urgent problem: Inhalation of airborne PCBs
may be the most significant route for human exposure to these important toxic chemicals. The ISRP’s long-
term goal is to develop recommendations to prevent and/or limit human exposure to airborne PCBs and to
improve the health and well-being of the population. The ISRP renewal will focus on PCBs in air, particularly in
buildings (especially schools) and those emitted from contaminated waters (including Superfund sites). We will
examine the health impacts of inhaled PCBs, particularly on adolescents, with a focus on neurodevelopmental
and metabolic effects. The ISRP will accomplish its long-term goal through the following integrated Specific
Aims: 1) Clarify the biochemical mechanisms of toxicity of lower-chlorinated PCBs in adolescence. Two
projects will address how PCBs and their metabolites are risk factors for altered neurodevelopment during
adolescence and the mechanisms by which these compounds interfere with lipid metabolism. 2) Define
susceptible populations, assess exposure and accumulation of these compounds (particularly in
schools), and evaluate the relative importance of airborne vs. dietary exposure. Three cohorts of
mothers and adolescents will help us evaluate individuals’ exposure to airborne PCBs, the specific
environments that contribute to inhalation exposure, and its importance compared to exposure through diet. 3)
Reduce emissions of airborne PCBs from building materials, products, and contaminated sediments.
We will investigate sources of airborne PCBs in indoor environments, determine the magnitude of emissions
from contaminated waters, and identify cost-effective strategies to remove or reduce emissions. This includes
development of a new approach using novel materials to sequester lower chlorinated PCBs in sediments and
break down PCBs through microbial processes to reduce PCB emissions from contaminated waters. 4) Train
and attract new scientists to the environmental health sciences. Our training program will enhance
research skills in data science, chemical analysis, community engagement, and research translation. 5)
Engage the scientific community and stakeholders in bi-directional communication on ISRP research
priorities, findings, and recommendations. We will communicate the ISRP’s research approaches and
findings to a wide range of researchers, agencies, and community stakeholders to maximize impact and
enable communities to make timely, informed decisions to reduce local PCB exposure."
10891680,"PROJECT SUMMARY: OVERALL
We are proposing the creation of a research program entitled, “Increasing the therapeutic index of brain tumor
treatment through innovative FLASH radiotherapy (FLASH-RT), focused on translating a novel irradiation
modality rapidly into the clinic. The overall hypothesis to be tested is whether radiation delivered at ultra high
dose rates (compared to the much lower dose rates used in current clinical practice) can significantly ameliorate
normal tissue complications while maintaining acceptable if not improved tumor control. To test this hypothesis,
the program will deploy a comprehensive series of preclinical studies across 4 projects that will evaluate effects
of FLASH-RT on tumor control and neurocognition. Work at 3 performance sites (CHUV, Stanford, Indiana) will
implement conventional and FLASH irradiation paradigms to evaluate how each radiation modality impacts GBM
tumor control, neurocognition and associated pathologies in orthotopic tumor bearing and tumor free animals
(Projects 1 and 2). A clinical trial conducted at the CHUV in Switzerland will recruit GBM dog patients to evaluate
the therapeutic benefits of dose escalation using the FLASH modality. Lastly, each performance site will be
involved in elucidating the mechanistic basis of the FLASH effect by altering oxygen tension during irradiation
and by implementing redox sensitive transgenic mouse models. Importantly, this work will be facilitated and
integrated by two critical research cores (dosimetry/physics and neurobehavioral). In the Dosimetry and Physics
Core 2, radiation dosimetry will be cross-validated and technological innovation will be implemented across all
irradiation platforms at the CHUV, Stanford and Indiana University. In the Neurobehavioral Core 3, animals
irradiated at each performance site will be shipped to UCI where animals will be subjected to a standard and
comprehensive battery of carefully controlled behavioral tests designed to evaluate how each irradiation
paradigm functionally impacts cognition. The Administrative Core will serve as the organizational hub for all
scientific and programmatic activities. The overall goal of this Core will be to centralize these activities while
promoting efficiency in operations and transparency for the program investigators."
10767245,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Evidence suggests that exposure to Superfund chemicals contributes to adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs),
including preterm birth (PTB). Rates of PTB and infant mortality in Puerto Rico (PR) are among the highest of
all US states and territories. There are 18 Superfund sites in PR, and evidence of contamination of the drinking
water is extensive. Moreover, extreme weather events (hurricanes, flooding) may result in elevated exposures
to Superfund chemicals. The PROTECT center has brought together researchers from Northeastern
University, the University of Puerto Rico, University of Georgia, and the University of Michigan to provide much
needed understanding of the relationship and the mechanisms by which exposure to suspect chemicals
contribute to APOs, and to develop new methods to reduce risk of exposure in PR and beyond. To do this,
PROTECT uses a source-to-outcome structure, integrating epidemiological (Project 1), toxicological (Project
2), fate and transport (Project 3), and remediation (Project 4) studies, a unified sampling infrastructure, a
centralized indexed data repository, and a sophisticated data management system.
Since its inception in 2010, PROTECT has built detailed and extensive data sets on environmental conditions
and prenatal conditions of 1457 pregnant mothers (exposure, socioeconomic and health data–close to 3000
data points per participant), yielding a cohort of 1210 live births in northern PR. In the renewal, PROTECT will
recruit and follow an additional 1000 study participants, yielding a cohort of 800+ live births for an ultimate total
cohort of 2000+ completed live births. PROTECT has documented significant contamination of northern PR
drinking water and has found compelling preliminary epidemiologic and mechanistic toxicology associations
between Superfund chemicals and APOs. PROTECT research has focused on chlorinated volatile organic
compounds and phthalates and their role in PTB. The PROTECT renewal will broaden its scope, employing a
data-driven approach to study and reduce the impact of exposure to mixtures of suspect chemicals
from Superfund sites in karst regions on APOs in Puerto Rico’s underserved, highly-exposed
population. Target chemicals will be expanded to include metals, pesticides, and polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons. We will investigate the impacts of extreme weather events on contaminant transport and
exposure, and new water treatment technologies will be developed for portable and robust water treatment
systems. The PROTECT renewal will also focus on oxidative stress as an underlying biological pathway by
which contaminant exposure can lead to APOs. New statistical methods and data mining, machine learning,
and visualization tools will be developed to allow PROTECT researchers to analyze our datasets. PROTECT
will employ innovative approaches to engage and educate the community, involve study participants, report-
back data, and communicate with stakeholders. A broad suite of training and professional activities will be
provided to trainees, individually tailored to the trainees’ needs and goals."
10876404,"Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) remains a formidable cancer to treat with only anecdotal examples of long-term survivors.
Recently, immunotherapy has seen multiple successes against various types of cancer, but several recent
clinical trials of this modality in GBM have not been successful. It is evident that two inter-related factors in the
complex immunobiology of GBM have thwarted therapeutic efficacy: the existence of multiple
immunosuppressive mechanisms and the significant lymphodepletion in the GBM microenvironment. The
overarching goal of the Program Project is to address the problem of insufficient T cell activation and marked T
cell attenuation in the GBM microenvironment. We will test the overall hypothesis that promotion of CD8+
and CD4+ T cell functionality can overcome the highly immunosuppressive mechanisms of GBM. A
corollary to this hypothesis is that preclinical and clinical trials of immunotherapy combinations will provide
an effective approach to GBM treatment. We have assembled a highly interactive and interdisciplinary team
of 11 investigators in 4 highly integrated Research Projects, supported by 4 Cores. This team (some of whom
have been working together for more than two decades) brings deep expertise in immunobiology, neuro-
oncology, clinical trials, genomics and computational analyses to mechanistically study these two critical factors.
We plan to study how immune checkpoint blockade can be combined with other T cell activating
immunotherapies both in a clinical trial (Project 1) and in preclinical mouse models (Project 2). We propose to
study novel immunosuppressive pathways in human GBMs based on CD161/ Clec2D (Project 3), IL-27 and
endogenous glucocorticoid signaling (Project 4) and understand how these can be overcome to improve the
anti-tumor function of CD4 and CD8 effector T cells. Core services will provide sophisticated genomic (Core 1),
biocomputational/ biostatistical (Core 2), and mouse modeling/ imaging (Core 3) approaches to these Projects.
This Program Project will thus provide significant mechanistic insights into the immunosuppressive
microenvironment of GBM, into preclinical avenues of how to activate T cells against these tumors and finally
into a novel clinical trial to target personalized GBM neoantigens in humans."
10874672,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Through three inter-related and inter-dependent Projects and four essential Cores, our team will continue to
define the biological basis of dysfunctional sphingolipid metabolism in AML, and in that process, validate new
therapeutic targets for pharmacological treatment approaches. The premise of the renewal P01 application is
that targeting enzymes responsible for dysfunctional sphingolipid metabolism will lead to new clinical options in
AML. The overall hypothesis to be tested by all projects is that increasing endogenous pro-apoptotic ceramide
species, while diminishing pro-survival phosphorylated or glycosylated ceramide metabolites, will yield
efficacious treatments for AML. The overall premise of this renewal application are the exciting results from the
first-in-man clinical trial of ceramide nanoliposomes for solid tumors (NCT02834611), demonstrating the lack of
dose-limiting toxicities at doses where stable disease is observed. Exciting preliminary and published in vivo
data provide the rationale for nanoscale delivery vehicles for exogenous ceramide as an adjuvant therapy to
support standard of care therapy (low-dose AraC and venetoclax) in a phase Ib/IIa clinical trial for
relapsed/refractory AML (Project 1, CAV trial, UVA Protocol Review Committee approval #5414, pre-IND
142902). In addition, preliminary and published data are provided demonstrating that selective inhibitors of
ceramide metabolism (Projects 2-3) increase the clinical utility of agents that raise levels of pro-apoptotic
ceramides. A common scientific theme of all Projects is the mechanistic investigation of drug resistance and
programmed cell death, which can be directly altered with sphingolipid-based therapeutics. The major
innovation of our P01 is to utilize a bioinformatic and systems biology approach to integrate genomics,
sphingolipidomics, and proteomics data from molecularly defined patient samples to reveal susceptible
populations for testing innovative sphingolipid-targeted therapeutics in state-of-the-art patient-derived
xenografts, genetically engineered murine models, and most importantly, a clinical trial. The major goal of this
proposal is to develop new sphingolipid-targeted therapeutics for AML. The interdisciplinary team includes
leaders in the fields of leukemia (specifically AML), nanoscale delivery systems for bioactive lipids, programmed
cell death, and the biochemistry and biophysics of sphingolipids. This major goal will be accomplished through
the following overarching five Specific Aims that are shared by all Projects and Cores: 1) Evaluate the efficacy
of therapeutics that elevate exogenous or endogenous levels of pro-apoptotic ceramide species in animal and
clinical trials; 2) Obtain preclinical and clinical PK, bio-distribution, and toxicology data to support and/or expand
our FDA-IND for sphingolipid-based AML therapeutics; 3) Define the biochemical, biophysical, and molecular
mechanisms underlying the synergies obtained with agents that target dysfunctional sphingolipid metabolism; 4)
Understand the molecular basis defining variable dysfunctional sphingolipid metabolism for heterogeneous AML;
5) Define and validate lipid-based biomarkers as diagnostic or prognostic indicators."
10799664,"Project Summary
 This is the revised second competing renewal of a Program Project (PP) focused on investigating the role
that age-related changes in autophagy play in the functional alterations and inefficient stress response of old
organisms. The programmatic approach has allowed us to establish previously unknown connections between
autophagy, an essential component of the proteostasis network, and key cellular processes in biology of aging
such as metabolism, immune response/inflammation and the stress response. The expansion of our team
of experts and the conceptual and technical maturation of the program have placed us in an ideal position to
contribute to test the Geroscience hypothesis that aging is the major risk factor for common chronic diseases
and that modulating processes that contribute to aging could set the basis for new interventions to ameliorate
aging-related disorders. We propose to use modulation of autophagy as a way to prevent or delay
proteotoxicity and proteostasis loss associated with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD).
 The components of the PP are four Projects involving 8 faculty members from 6 academic departments and
four Cores that provide support to the research activities of the four projects. The projects share ideas,
techniques and experimental models. Completion of aims in each project requires participation of members from
several of the Projects and Cores. The PP activities are reviewed periodically by the executive committee, and
an internal (Einstein Faculty) and external (faculty at other institutions) Scientific Advisory Committee.
 The long-term goal of the PP remains testing the overall hypothesis that impairment in autophagy in elders
mediates the functional deterioration and increases vulnerability to proteotoxicity associated with diseases, in
this case AD. Building on the novel findings of the previous period, we propose now the following specific aims:
1) to determine the impact of AD-associated proteotoxicity on proteostasis and activity of three main autophagic
pathways CMA (P1, P3), MA (P4, P3) and eMI (P1, P2, P3) in peripheral tissues (liver, adipose tissue, pancreas,
skeletal muscle) (P1, P4) and the immune and hematopoietic systems (P2, P3). 2) to determine the contribution
of lymph in the transference of the aging and AD-related signature of brain proteotoxicity to peripheral tissues
(P1, P2, P4); 3) to determine the impact of loss of autophagy-dependent proteostasis in peripheral tissues (P1,
P4) and the immune system (P3) on AD-related proteotoxicity progression and 4) to analyze the effect on AD-
related proteotoxicity of genetic (P1, P3), chemical (P1, P3, P4) and dietary (P2, P3, P4) interventions that
enhance/restore normal autophagy in old organisms. These studies will require the synergistic cooperation of
groups with expertise in aging, AD-related proteotoxicity, autophagy, proteostasis, dendritic cell function, T cell
biology, hematopoiesis, lymph, lipid and glucose metabolism, nutrient sensing, medicinal chemistry, advanced
high-resolution and in vivo imaging, drug development, and data analysis and integration.
Relevance: We explore the novel concept that interventions to restore/enhance autophagy could be applied as
anti-aging strategies to prolong health-span and ameliorate AD-related proteotoxicity. Our studies may ultimately
provide pre-clinical evidence of the value of autophagy targeting in the treatment of AD/ADRD."

The NCI-designated UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center (JCCC) resides within the most populous,
most diverse county in the US, with a mission to accelerate discoveries that prevent and cure cancer. Through
a broad spectrum of research, education, training, and community engagement activities, the Center strives to
reduce the burden of cancer in its Los Angeles County (LAC) catchment area, nationally, and globally by
improving the standards for cancer prevention, detection, treatment, control, and survivorship. To advance its
mission, the Center supports three Basic/Translational Research Programs (Epigenomics, RNA & Gene
Regulation (ERGR); Cancer & Stem Cell Biology (CSCB); Cancer Molecular Imaging, Nanotechnology &
Theranostics (CMINT)), two Clinical/Translational Research Programs (Signal Transduction & Therapeutics
(STT); Tumor Immunology (TI)), one Population Science Research Program (Cancer Control & Survivorship
(CCS)), six Shared Resources, an Office for Cancer Training and Education, and a Community Outreach and
Engagement core.
During 2013 – 2018, the JCCC made substantial progress in its mission, with significant advances in many areas.
Examples include improvements in prevention through vaccination, e-cigarette, and obesity education, in
detection with a national screening trial in lung cancer, in treatment with 11 new, practice changing FDA-
approved therapeutics in cell therapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, and in survivorship with intervention
studies for breast cancer survivors with severe insomnia and leadership in developing national guidelines for
survivorship care.
A generational transition in institutional and JCCC senior leadership, and a recent, comprehensive Strategic
Planning activity, guide the next five years of Center progress, with an unprecedented increase in institutional
support and historic organizational changes implemented to meet ongoing and emerging opportunities and
challenges in a rapidly changing healthcare environment. An aspirational vision to eradicate cancer in LAC, the
nation, and the world drives Center leaders and membership to address difficult but essential problems in cancer.
In the next period, with our community partners, the JCCC will advance studies that aim to define individual
cancer risk to inform prevention, treatment, and foster survivorship; decode the initiation and evolution of cancer;
understand individual cancers at unprecedented levels to improve patient treatment and outcomes; and harness
the body’s immune system to control and treat cancer."
10850553,"In this P01 proposal renewal entitled “Pathobiology of Neurodegeneration in C9orf72 Repeat Expansion”, we seek to improve the diagnosis of and prognosis for patients suffering from C9orf72-associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Our integrated Projects and Cores will accomplish this by identifying therapeutic targets and biomarkers for “c9ALS/FTD” and continuing with our productive endeavors to elucidate the mechanisms by which G4C2 repeat expansions in the C9orf72 gene cause neurodegeneration. We have assembled a world-class team of investigators with expertise in neurology, genetics, neuropathology, “-omics”, disease modeling, biomarkers and bioinformatics that have worked closely together and have all resources in place. Our significant progress to determine the pathomechanisms underpinning c9ALS/FTD has led to the discoveries that poly(GR) proteins atypically translated from expanded G4C2 repeats correlate with neurodegeneration in c9ALS/FTD patients and cause neuronal loss in mice, and that poly(GR) induces the formation of stress granules and impairs their disassembly. The latter may account for the observed nucleocytoplasmic transport defects in c9ALS/FTD given our finding that nucleocytoplasmic transport factors are aberrantly recruited to stress granules. In the proposed projects, we will build upon these exciting findings and tackle new questions in need of answers in order to develop effective treatments for c9ALS/FTD. Indeed, deep proteomic and transcriptomic profiling, respectively, using next-generation mass spectrometry and single-nucleus RNA sequencing of brain tissues from c9ALS patients and (G4C2)149 mice will uncover protein and gene networks that represent target pathways for c9ALS. Furthermore, by interrogating the proteome and transcriptome of (G4C2)149 mice and c9ALS patient-derived neuronal cultures treated with repeat-targeting antisense oligonucleotides (ASO), we will identify protein co-expression modules and hub proteins that respond to treatment and thus represent potential therapeutic targets and candidate biomarkers. The latter represent a critical need given that the development and testing of potential ALS treatments have been seriously hampered by the lack of biomarkers to aid in the early diagnosis of ALS, to forecast disease progression, and to confirm target engagement. To enable all three research projects to effectively achieve their goals, biofluids and brain tissues from c9ALS patients will be collected by the research cores, which will also assist with analyzing and integrating data, as well as validating findings. Overall, our multi-disciplinary, synergistic studies will improve our understanding of C9orf72-related neurodegeneration, identify potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets, and develop a comprehensive brain and biofluid resource for the c9ALS field."
10922689,"PROGRAM SUMMARY
Pulmonary vascular disease (PVD) is perhaps the most important complication for children with congenital heart
disease (CHD) that results in increased pulmonary blood flow (PBF) and pressure. Postnatally, the presence of
large communications at the level of the ventricles (e.g. ventricular septal defect) or great vessels (e.g. truncus
arteriosus) exposes the pulmonary circulation to abnormal elevations in blood flow and pressure, which results
in progressive structural and functional abnormalities of the pulmonary vasculature. Metabolic reprogramming is
increasingly recognized as a critical component of early pulmonary vascular injury and disease. Vascular
morphology studies in our Shunt lamb model demonstrate a >2-fold increase in pulmonary arterioles in Shunt
compared to control lambs. This is opposed to the decrease in arterial counts demonstrated in humans with
advanced disease. This early increase in angiogenesis likely represents an adaptation to the increase in flow
and pressure. The development of a hyperproliferative, anti-apoptotic endothelial phenotype is necessary for this
angiogenic response. Further, it requires a dramatic metabolic reprogramming that serves to supply these cells
with the necessary biosynthetic precursors required for cell division while simultaneously decreasing cellular
ATP levels due to increased consumption and decreased respiration. We have linked this decrease in ATP to
the loss of hsp90-mediated NO signaling and the development of endothelial dysfunction and vascular
remodeling. Thus, this PPG intensely focuses on increasing our understanding of: i) the differential effects of
mechanical forces on cellular metabolic programming; ii) post translational modifications (PTMs) that influence
key signaling pathways involved in metabolic reprogramming; iii) interactions between mitochondrial network
dynamics, metabolism, and cellular survival; iv) how these pathways interact to disrupt hsp90-mediated NO
signaling; and v) novel therapeutic strategies for treating CHD with increased PBF. The key novel pathways that
comprise the focus of each Project were identified by our intensive investigations into the metabolic
reprogramming underlying the development of pulmonary vascular disease and selected for their capacity to
contribute to a spectrum of cellular responses related to glutaminolysis and aerobic glycolysis (Project #1),
cellular ß-oxidation and mitochondrial bioenergetics (Project #2), mitochondrial network dynamics and
mitophagy (Project #3), and cell proliferation and apoptosis (Projects #1 & #3). Investigations are integrated
across our three PPG projects to fully understand how metabolic reprogramming leads to the loss of hsp90-
mediated NO signaling and represents the thematic underpinning of this PPG. The synergy derived from the
interactions between individual Projects and scientific Cores, with our programmatic approaches, will promote
an increased understanding of how mechanical forces modify cell metabolism, NO signaling and endothelial
function, and the development of novel, individualized therapies to attenuate pulmonary vascular disease in
children born with CHD that result in increased PBF and pressure."

The Program Project Grant “Chemoprevention and mechanisms of obesity-promoted pancreatic
adenocarcinoma” constitutes a highly collaborative, multidisciplinary research program designed to make a
significant impact on the investigation of obesity in the development of pancreatic cancer. A detailed
understanding of the biological mechanisms of action of obesity on pancreatic cancer development can form the
rationale for biologically-based practices, scientifically-founded recommendations and interventional strategies
in the prevention of this disease. The Program Project includes expertise from the UCLA campus and Cedars
Sinai Medical Center. The Program is led by experienced pancreatic cancer researchers, who have organized
investigative teams to develop highly interactive and synergistic research programs. The goal is to study the
mechanisms, by which obesity promotes pancreatic cancer development and to explore interventional, cancer-
preventing strategies. Innovative animal and cell culture models and novel concepts strongly supported by a
wealth of preliminary data are proposed. The Projects will focus on: Adipose tissue inflammation in obesity-
promoted pancreatic cancer (Project 1); Chemoprevention of pancreatic cancer with lipid-lowering and
antidiabetic agents (Project 2); Role of the pancreatic fibro-inflammatory microenvironment in obesity-
promoted pancreatic cancer (Project 3). The projects will utilize an Administrative Core (with Biostatistics Sub-
Core) and a Shared Resource Core, the Animal and Cell Models Core (with Pathology Sub-Core). An External
Advisory Board comprised of nationally and internationally recognized translational pancreatic cancer
investigators and advocates has been assembled. The Program Project is designed for maximum integration
and synergy of research and key investigators, who have been collaborating for more than 12 years so that the
proposed Program can be focused on the most promising investigations with the greatest translational potential
and impact."
10775717,"SUMMARY—OVERALL. The Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS) was established nine years ago to elucidate
the impact of the hallmark proteinopathies of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), i.e., amyloid-beta (aβ) and tau, as
assessed by PET imaging, in clinically normal older individuals. This is a competing renewal application for a
third cycle of the HABS Program Project Grant (PPG) to continue our longitudinal cognitive and multi-modality
imaging assessments of an extremely dedicated and richly phenotyped cohort of participants (currently age 51-
94, with diversity in ethnicity and socioeconomic status), and to leverage innovative technology to advance our
quest to better understand cognitive aging and preclinical AD. We have made excellent progress in achieving
the scientific goals of our second grant cycle, with over 100 research publications during the past four years
that have informed ongoing prevention trial designs and international initiatives on the study of AD and other
age-related pathologies. Our overall goals in this renewal are to: 1) Go earlier: investigate the earliest stages
of aβ and tau accumulation, evaluating specific anatomic patterns of progression, and the interactions of these
pathologies in the “pre-preclinical” phase of AD. 2) Go broader: investigate potential modulating factors, such
as vascular risk, physical activity, and systemic inflammation that may independently contribute to cognitive
decline, and interact with aβ and tau to accelerate cognitive decline. 3) Go deeper: explore novel measures of
synaptic integrity and utilize multifaceted digital technology to capture specific alterations in cognitive
processes. 4) Go faster: enable more rapid and efficient assessment of change in imaging and cognitive
measures over shorter time intervals, and ultimately predict progression on clinically meaningful outcomes. We
propose five Cores, including a new Biomarker Core, that will support four Projects: Project 1: Investigate
longitudinal aβ and tau PET relationships and identify in vivo pathoanatomic stages detectable over the course
of preclinical AD. Project 2: Investigate the contribution of other factors that modulate clinical decline, including
vascular disease, physical activity, and exploratory blood biomarkers of neural injury and inflammation. Project
3: Evaluate longitudinal multi-modality imaging measures of synaptic function and explore a novel PET tracer
of synaptic integrity. Project 4: Investigate the determinants of cognitive decline, optimize rapid detection with
novel digital measures, and establish the clinical meaningfulness of early cognitive changes. This HABS PPG
renewal will leverage an outstanding group of multidisciplinary investigators, access to cutting-edge imaging
and cognitive assessment technology, and an extremely well-characterized cohort with some of the longest tau
PET follow up in existence. The additional longitudinal assessments will allow us to determine the factors that
promote healthy brain aging vs. those that confer susceptibility to accumulating aβ and tau, and vulnerability
vs. resilience to cognitive decline in the setting of early AD pathology, with the ultimate goal of accelerating
progress towards the effective prevention of cognitive decline along the trajectory of preclinical AD."
10832519,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Successfully integrating the financing and delivery of care remains a primary goal of the Medicare program
after years of expanding efforts, including a recent period of unprecedented experimentation. The resulting
changes in Medicare have created opportunities to understand how payment systems affect patient care and
outcomes. The Medicare Advantage (MA) program is Medicare's most significant attempt to integrate financing
and care. Currently 36% of beneficiaries are enrolled in capitated private plans that can influence patient care
and outcomes through multiple mechanisms, including selective contracting, benefit design, and care
management. Given that the majority of beneficiaries remain in Traditional Medicare (TM), Medicare has
implemented efforts to integrate financing and care in that program as well, including alternative payment
models (APMs) in which Medicare risk-contracts with providers directly. The evidence on the merits of MA is
largely observational, and little is known about the relative performance of APMs. Moreover, the implications of
integrated financing and delivery for patients remain unclear and understudied. Until recently, data on the MA
program were insufficient to support detailed empirical exploration of differences in care patterns and the
potential mechanisms driving them. Potential lessons abound from state Medicaid programs, which typically
use narrower provider networks than MA plans and have increasingly delegated care management to private
plans, but the relative impact on patient care of approaches taken in Medicaid and Medicare have not been
quantified. There is recognition across the various integration initiatives that one size does not fit all; payments
that are prospective, or incorporate prospective elements, give plans and providers greater flexibility in
selecting inputs of care to support patients' health and well-being. But the implications for patients with special
needs are poorly understood. Many challenges remain in payment system design and performance monitoring,
particularly in methods of risk adjustment. Thus, as Medicare innovates and evolves, sound analysis is needed
to generate an evidence base for understanding how payment systems affect patients. This Program Project,
“Improving Medicare in an Era of Change,” focuses on the consequences of a changing Medicare program for
patient care and outcomes. It intends to supply foundational insights for designing payment systems in health
care. Our research agenda encompasses four key areas: 1) comparative performance of MA and TM and
variants of each; 2) strategies employed by MA plans; 3) learning from state Medicaid programs; and 4)
experiences of Medicare patients with dementia and their implications for payment system refinements for
patients with special needs. Our proposal builds on our current Program Project by leveraging new data
sources and empirical approaches to: examine previously unanswerable questions; support rigorous system
comparisons; and identify potential directions for improvement by exploring variation in payment and delivery
system features in the increasingly heterogeneous Medicare and Medicaid programs."
10868619,"PROJECT SUMMARY/DESCRIPTION
Polymerase theta (Pol q, gene name Polq) is essential in many hereditary breast cancers, yet loss of Pol q is
well tolerated in most normal cells. As a consequence, there has been much excitement in the development of
targeted inhibitors of Pol q for cancer therapy. However, we know little about the biological role and
mechanism of action for this large, multi-domain factor. It has thus not been possible to reconcile the disparate,
apparently context-dependent impacts of Pol q loss on mutation, chromosome aberration, and cell survival,
and the safe, effective targeting of Pol q for therapy has been largely frustrated.
In overall Aim 1, the mechanism by which full-length Pol q and Pol q domains contribute to repair will be
characterized by parallel analysis using the biochemical, structural, genetic and biophysical imaging
approaches available to our program. Full pathway reconstitution and visualization is a goal. In Overall Aim 2
we will investigate the cellular contexts that normally engage Pol q. In Overall Aim 3 we will integrate insights
gained from these other Aims to develop rationales for safer, effective targeting of Pol q in cancer therapy.
The research work will be highly coordinated within the Program Project in a framework with three Core
facilities. Substrates, proteins, and experiments will be designed with all Projects and constantly monitored with
feedback via Administrative Core A. Protein purification will be supported by Core B, and cell line construction
by Core C.
The scientific project leaders have complementary expertise: Drs. Dale Ramsden (molecular biology; Project
1), Gaorav Gupta (cancer cell biology; Project 1), Richard Wood (biochemistry, Project 2) Sylvie Doublié
(structural biology and mechanism; Project 3), and Eli Rothenberg (biophysics; Project 4). This ensemble of
complementary expertise fosters cross-fertilization of ideas beneficial to the whole team, and makes work
possible that can only be accomplished by a Program Project grant. This team also already has a long track
record of productive collaboration, and within this program project will work effectively and synergistically to
accomplish the Program’s goals. The results obtained by this Program Project will provide a fundamental
advance in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning TMEJ, and will pave the way for the
design of novel cancer therapy via Pol θ inhibition."

Overall
Despite the development of increasingly effective therapies to reduce elevated levels of atherogenic lipoproteins,
cardiovascular disease (CVD) complications are projected to rise worldwide due in part to the increasing
incidence of obesity and insulin resistance. An emergent question is the extent to which non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease (NAFLD), which is a spectrum ranging from fatty liver to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) to cirrhosis,
contributes to CVD risk. Among patients with NAFLD, the leading cause of death is CVD, estimated to account
for 31% of total mortality. The development of NAFLD and cardiovascular disease is influenced by combinations
of genetic and environmental factors, some of which are disease-specific and others that affect both disease
processes. The overall hypotheses of our PPG are that liver fat and fibrosis predict CVD risk and that
interventions targeting Liver X receptors (LXRs) in macrophages, the farnesyl X receptor (FXR) in the gut, and
oxidation specific epitopes (OSEs) in the liver and artery wall will reveal common mechanisms that contribute to
the clinical association between NASH and CVD. Importantly, each of these interventions make use of
representative small molecules or antibodies that have the potential to be advanced for clinical trials. Identifying
mechanisms by which known and unknown risk factors promote both NASH and CVD would be of great
significance, especially if targeting one or more of these mechanisms would produce beneficial effects on both
diseases. To achieve this goal, we propose a PPG consisting of four highly inter-related projects and three cores.
Project 1, led by Dr. Christopher Glass, will test the hypothesis that selective activation of LXRs in macrophages
and Kupffer cells with desmosterol mimetics will result in reductions of atherosclerosis and NASH without causing
steatosis or hypertriglyceridemia. Project 2, led by Dr. Ronald Evans, will investigate the hypothesis that
selective activation of FXR in the gut or liver will result in reductions in atherosclerosis and NASH. Project 3,
led by Dr. Joseph Witztum, will test the hypothesis that antibody-mediated reductions in OSEs will coordinately
reduce both atherosclerosis and NASH. Project 4, led by Dr. Rohit Loomba, will investigate the relationships of
liver fat content and fibrosis with cardiovascular risk in human subjects and enable translational extension of
mechanistic findings made in Projects 1, 2 and 3. A Phenotyping Core will enable Projects 1, 2 and 3 to
quantitatively evaluate extent of atherosclerosis and NASH in mouse models, and enable all projects to obtain
targeted lipidomic profiles and cytokine levels from relevant samples. A Genomics and Bioinformatics Core
will support the application of massively parallel sequencing-based assays, such as RNA Seq, by Projects 1, 2
and 3 and provide a shared resource for bioinformatics and statistical analysis. An Administrative Core will
support the overall administrative and scientific needs of the PPG."

Over the past four decades, MIT has had a focused effort in cancer research, first in the form of the MIT Center
for Cancer Research (CCR) and, since 2007, as the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT.
This effort has been continuously supported by a Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) from the National
Cancer Institute (NCI), providing the designation as an NCI-designated Cancer Center at MIT. By supplying
infrastructural support for Core Facilities and other organizational components of the Koch Institute as well as
funds for faculty recruitment and pilot projects, this CCSG is a critical resource for cancer research at MIT.
From the establishment of the CCR in 1974 to the transition to the Koch Institute and continuing to the present,
the NCI Cancer Center designation has had a strong influence on the MIT administration, leading to significant
institutional support over this entire period. The investment in construction of the Koch Institute building
(opened in late 2010) is a recent indication of this support. The building brings together 27 cancer scientists
and cancer-oriented engineers to form a highly inter-disciplinary and collaborative research environment. The
building is also the hub of cancer research on the MIT campus, with a nearly equal number of Members of the
Center having their laboratories in other research buildings nearby. The 56 Center Members are drawn from
eight academic departments at the School of Science or School of Engineering at MIT. Beyond the discovery
research and technology development being pursued by the Members of this Center, significant emphasis is
placed on translational research in the form of collaborations with clinical centers and industry partners.
Research in the Koch Institute is organized into three Programs. Each of these Programs has made significant
advances over the current grant period. Program 1: Genetic & Cellular Programs in Cancer is co-led by Drs.
Phillip Sharp, J Christopher Love, and Eliezer Calo. Program 2: Cancer Biology & Immunology is co-led by
Drs. Richard Hynes, Dane Wittrup, and Stefani Spranger. Program 3: Systems and Engineering Approaches
to Cancer is co-led by Drs. Michael Yaffe, Scott Manalis, and Angela Koehler. These Programs function to
stimulate new research initiatives by their Members as well as to foster intra- and inter-programmatic
collaborations. In aggregate the 56 Members of this Center have published 1006 cancer-related articles over
the past grant period. Of those, nearly 18% have involved multiple Members. The Center has a cancer-related
funding base of $58,596,507 TDC (see Data Tables 2A/2B)."
10902106,"ABSTRACT
The research projects proposed in this SPORE address genomic instability in breast cancer. Three areas are
the focus of study: homologous recombination deficiency, chromosomal instability and APOBEC mutagenesis.
Our ultimate plan is to exploit tumor specific vulnerabilities by virtue of their underlying genomic instability.
These profiles of genomic instability have offered novel insights about the drivers breast cancer development
and progression. There are opportunities for therapeutic advances in breast cancer, which have emerged
based on the initial successes, for example, in utilizing homologous recombination deficiency by treatment with
a PARP inhibitor. The plan is to determine the optimal use of these agents and develop novel agents for these
tumors. Chromosomal instability, which does not necessarily have a unique pattern of mutations, is associated
with a poor prognosis, but no specific therapeutic strategy at present. The link between chromosomal
instability and innate immune signaling has been made, and the goal is to exploit this connection for therapy.
For APOBEC, we know that a characteristic pattern of SNVs are observed, but in this application, we are
highlighting the role of APOBEC in the acquisition of drug resistance, and introducing novel approaches for
reliably identifying and therapeutically targeting breast cancers with an active APOBEC mutagenesis process.
In summary, the goals are to take the risks of genomic instability (poor prognosis, rapid development of
resistance) and turn genomic instability into an advantage for therapeutic targeting, thereby improving the
prognosis for high risk breast cancers."

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the seventh most common cancer globally. Current
treatments are morbid, even for patients who are cured, and there are over 13,000 deaths in the US from HNSCC
annually. HPV-negative HNSCC is commonly resistant to DNA damaging therapy, EGFR inhibition and
immunotherapy. HPV-associated tumors are highly treatment-responsive, but 20-30 percent recur. Even with
immune checkpoint inhibition, the majority of these patients succumb. The Yale Head and Neck SPORE (YHN-
SPORE) represents highly translational researchers with deep disease-based expertise who leverage the
extraordinary scientific strength at Yale Cancer Center, to improve treatment for patients with this terrible
malignancy. YHN-SPORE investigators have significantly impacted the field of HNSCC through training, and
translational and clinical research. Basic scientists bring rigorous methodology to bear.
The YHN-SPORE seeks to address critical barriers to cure of HNSCC due to resistance to immune, DNA
damaging and targeted therapy through these specific aims: Aim 1: To overcome resistance to EGFR inhibition
in HNSCC by targeting active conformations of ErbB family members; Aim 2: To advance rational synthetic
lethal combination therapy to the clinic in HPV-negative HNSCC; Aim 3: To advance combination demethylating
therapy with immune checkpoint inhibition to the clinic for HPV-mediated HNSCC, with mechanistic studies and
characterization of immune response; Aim 4: To bolster the foundation for HNSCC research through our
Administrative, Biospecimen and Biostatistics/Bioinformatics cores, to engage institutional resources and the
wider SPORE community; and Aim 5: To advance new research and to foster the next generation of HNSCC
translational researchers through a Developmental Research Program, a Career Enhancement Program, and
interaction and collaboration with the wider SPORE and HNSCC research communities. The overarching theme
of the 3 coordinated projects is overcoming treatment resistance, spanning mechanistic insights into resistance
to current treatment modalities and immunotherapy; translational validation; human endpoints to underpin future
trials of novel strategies to circumvent resistance; mechanistic confirmation in correlative studies; and clinical
trials in HPV-negative and HPV-driven HNSCC. Anticipated translational outcomes of the YHN-SPORE are:
(1) conformationally sensitive inhibitors to overcome resistance to EGFR inhibition in HNSCC; (2) clinical safety
and pharmacodynamic data combined aurora A kinase/WEE1 inhibition in HPV-negative HNSCC; (3) proof-of-
concept and immunoprofiling data to support development of combined demethylation and immunotherapy in
HPV-mediated HNSCC; (4) novel models and genomically-characterized tumors to enable HNSCC translational
research; and (5) a diverse group of young investigators who will emerge as the generation who cure HNSCC."

11092954,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This application requests funds to refine and rigorously test a collaborative care model for patients with opioid
use disorder (OUD) and major depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, or an anxiety disorder in primary
care. We also will examine clinician and practice characteristics associated with successful implementation
and the cost effectiveness of different care models. The primary aims of this proposal are: (1) Rapidly
prototype and test each element of our collaborative care models to optimize it for implementation; (2) Conduct
a randomized study of three collaborative care conditions with 39 practices to determine which is most
effective in improving outcomes for people with OUD and mental health conditions: (a) Augmented Usual Care:
PCP waivered to prescribe buprenorphine and mental health care manager, (b) Collaborative Care: Waiver
PCP; mental health care manager receives OUD training; practice receives telephonic psychiatric consultation,
or (c) Collaborative Care + Social Worker to address social determinants of health; (3) Measure clinician and
organizational-level factors associated with implementation of each component, with the goal of developing
strategies to increase successful implementation; (4) Conduct a cost evaluation of each collaborative care
model; and (5) Work with smaller and more rural practices to develop and test effective strategies to manage
OUD. Successful completion of the proposed study will provide definitive evidence regarding the most
parsimonious set of elements of integrated collaborative care required to maximize outcomes for individuals
with OUD and psychiatric disorders. Because of the study design, our examination of implementation factors,
and our community partnerships, the results also will have high probability of adoption and implementation."
10636616,"Background: Reported penicillin allergies are present in 10% of the US population, with higher rates in
hospitalized and older patients; rates up to 16% have been found in VA nursing home patients. However, fewer
than 10% of patients are found to be truly allergic based on skin testing and most patients can safely receive
penicillin. The consequences of being labeled as penicillin allergic include use of broader spectrum antibiotics
which can result in more treatment failures, more adverse effects, higher healthcare costs, and increased risk
for development of antibiotic resistance. The nursing home population is particularly vulnerable to the effects of
potentially inappropriate antibiotic use due to factors including high infection burden and frailty.
 Recognition of the problem of increasing antibiotic resistance and importance of antimicrobial
stewardship as a tool to curb it has heightened awareness of this issue of penicillin mis-labelling both in and
outside the VA. While guidelines for evaluating and managing penicillin allergy exist, they have been
infrequently applied in practice. This in part due to lack of provider knowledge on how to take an appropriate
penicillin, the role of allergy testing, risks of mislabeling and lack of access to specialized allergy testing.
Significance/Impact: To address these knowledge gaps, an explicit guideline-based clinical pathway and
toolkit were recently developed. These have been effectively and safely applied in selected inpatient and
outpatient settings to improve outcomes. However, they have not yet been applied to nursing home
populations. Thus, this represents a unique opportunity to apply these tools to improve penicillin antibiotic use
and outcomes in this vulnerable population.
Innovation: This project will be a pre-implementation pilot of a newly available evidence-based clinical
pathway and toolkit designed to improve evaluation and management of penicillin allergy. These were
developed and thus far only used in the non-long term care setting.
Specific Aims: 1) Identify potential barriers and facilitators to successful implementation of a clinical pathway
and toolkit aimed at improving use of penicillin in patients with documented penicillin allergies; 1a) examine
clinical staff and local leadership perspectives; 1b) examine patients and family members perspectives. 2)
Develop a modified pathway and toolkit for use in Community Living Centers (CLCs).
Methodology: This is a 1-year qualitative pilot study based at the Bedford VAMC. The Consolidated
Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), supplemented with the Health Belief model for Aim 1b, will
guide our assessment to understand contextual factors that may affect uptake of the intervention. For Aim 1a,
we will conduct up to 15-20 in-person semi-structured interviews with CLC providers (nurses, physicians, nurse
practitioners, clinical pharmacists) and 4-6 with selected local leadership (chiefs of nursing, geriatrics, and
pharmacy, patient safety manager). We will examine factors including perceptions of risk of allergy testing,
perceived ability to successfully follow the pathway and tools, and solicit recommendations for pathway and
toolkit modifications. For Aim 1b, we will conduct up to 15-20 semi-structured interviews with CLC patients with
documented penicillin allergies and CLC residents’ family members to assess their knowledge and beliefs
including their understanding of allergy mislabeling implications and perceived susceptibility to adverse
consequences of the allergy testing strategies. Based on information from Aims 1a and 1b, we will propose
changes to the pathway and toolkit. We will establish consensus on proposed changes via input from an expert
advisory panel using a 2-round modified Delphi approach. We will then have developed a modified pathway
and toolkit for use in CLCs. Aim 1 information will also inform subsequent IIR implementation strategies.
Implementation/Next Steps: The modified clinical pathway and toolkit will be implemented at selected CLC
sites in a future IIR, with the eventual goal of scaling it up for use across the VA to improve care."
10839405,"PROJECT SUMMARY_OVERALL
The Geroscience hypothesis is based on the observation that healthspan decline toward the end of life
often presents with a single age-related illness that is followed by rapid accumulation of age-related
complications over a relatively short period. According to this hypothesis, treating any one of these conditions
without treating the fundamental biology of aging will only result in its substitution by another. The discovery
of therapies that target aging biology to improve resilience and reduce frailty address the geroscience
hypothesis, but administering these therapies based exclusively on chronological age will inevitably result
in overtreatment. While pneumonia is more common and more severe in the elderly, most older patients with
access to modern health care survive their illness. However, in the year after hospital discharge these older
pneumonia survivors have an increased risk of developing age-related disorders including persistent lung
injury, skeletal muscle dysfunction leading to immobility, dementia, and cognitive impairment. As such,
pneumonia is a gateway for the compounding morbidity that limits healthspan at the end of life. We therefore
reason that interventions that target aging biology to improve repair and promote resilience administered
during recovery from pneumonia or other environmental stressors in the elderly will have broad impact.
Proteostasis refers to the dynamic process by which cells control the concentration, conformation, binding
interactions, and stability of individual proteins making up the proteome. In the first cycle of this award,
the PPG investigators have generated substantial published and preliminary data supporting the central
hypothesis of this PPG that advanced age is associated with impaired recovery from pneumonia, and
metabolic interventions targeting complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain can reverse these
changes by restoring proteostasis through the integrated stress response and ATF4. To address this
fundamental question in aging, the project investigators will focus on tissue recovery after infection with the
influenza A virus in mice, a clinically relevant model that can be rigorously applied across the entire lifespan and
which recapitulates human biology on a time frame that can be studied in the laboratory. We will test this
hypothesis in three interrelated projects/aims:
Aim 1. To determine whether age-related impairments in the reparative function of alveolar macrophages can
be reversed by transient low level inhibition of electron transport with complex I inhibitors via the ISR and ATF4.
Aim 2. To determine whether inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport at complex I over the lifespan
drives the age related impairment in recovery after influenza A pneumonia.
Aim 3. To determine whether the impaired scavenger receptor function of aged resident skeletal
muscle macrophages and microglia can be reversed by inhibitors of complex I via the ISR and ATF4 to
improve motor and cognitive function after pneumonia."
10242620,"Impact: Family members are primary sources of support for Veterans struggling with PTSD. While family
support and encouragement are powerful facilitators of Veterans’ mental health care engagement, few
interventions have been developed that capitalize on this support. To address this gap, VA created Coaching
Into Care (CIC) – a national telephone-based coaching service intended to educate, support, and empower
family members and friends who are seeking services for a Veteran. While program evaluation data show that
CIC is highly valued by callers, only about 25% of callers with Veterans not already in care, report that their
Veteran sought care over the next six months. The proposed study tests an innovative approach to improve
the effectiveness of CIC by integrating a web program called VA Community Reinforcement and Family Training
(VA-CRAFT), which is based on an empirically-validated intervention. The long-term goal is to establish an
efficacious, efficient, scalable, and satisfying family outreach intervention that will significantly increase mental
health service initiation among a high priority Veteran population while addressing the needs of their primary
supporters, their family members.
Background: PTSD is a highly prevalent psychiatric disorder among combat Veterans that often results in
significant individual impairment and distress for family members. Although evidence-based treatments are
available, most Veterans with PTSD do not receive any mental health care. Preliminary work suggests that
VA’s Coaching Into Care services could be improved by integrating VA-CRAFT. In a prior HSR&D-funded pilot,
our team found that family members who completed the relatively brief VA-CRAFT course alone (without
coaching) had greater decreases in caregiver burden than wait-list controls. However, qualitative interviews
also suggested that participants often did not raise the issue of treatment with their Veteran due to not believing
such a conversation would be successful. Therefore, we developed CIC+VA-CRAFT to leverage the strengths
of both approaches to increase family members’ motivation, perceived ability to have treatment-seeking
conversations with their Veteran, and success at engaging their Veterans in care. Initial findings from an NC-
PTSD-funded pilot of CIC+VA-CRAFT suggest that this brief, blended intervention is feasible, acceptable, and
potentially more effective than CIC alone in enhancing Veteran mental health treatment initiation.
Objectives: This project will employ a two-group randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare CIC+VA-
CRAFT to CIC only (treatment as usual). Specific aims are to: 1) Determine the effectiveness of CIC+VA-
CRAFT in enhancing Veterans’ mental health service initiation compared to CIC only; 2) Determine if CIC+VA-
CRAFT is non-inferior to CIC only on caller satisfaction, and 3) Conduct a process evaluation to inform potential
future implementation of CIC+VA-CRAFT. The project will also explore potential 1) treatment effects on other
important family-related outcomes, and 2) mediators and moderators of treatment. This proposal was
developed as a collaboration between the VA CIC and VA-CRAFT programs and their leadership, which will
facilitate the intervention’s rapid dissemination should the trial prove successful.
Methods: This is a four-year RCT that will recruit spouses or intimate partners of Veterans with PTSD using
social media advertisements and referrals from CIC. Participating partners will be randomized to the CIC+VA-
CRAFT (n = 115) or CIC only (n = 115) condition for up to three months. CIC+VA-CRAFT will include four
manualized CIC phone-coaching calls and access to the VA-CRAFT website. CIC participants will receive only
CIC services as usual. Assessments will be at baseline, post-intervention (3 months after randomization), and
six-month follow-up and will include partner reports of Veteran service utilization, caregiver burden, wellbeing,
and relationship functioning. The feasibility and acceptability of implementing CIC+VA-CRAFT will be assessed
with interviews of CIC+VA-CRAFT participants, Veterans of participants, and study and CIC phone coaches."
10618735,"Project Summary/Abstract
Debilitating neuropathic pain occurs in 40-70% of people who suffer from spinal cord injury
(SCI). It is unknown why, with similar injuries, one person will develop neuropathic pain while
another will not. There are no distinguishing characteristics to identify who will develop
neuropathic pain.
The objective of this research is to develop a biomarker signature prognostic of SCI-induced
neuropathic pain. The ultimate goal is to identify new non-addictive treatments for its prevention.
R61 Phase Specific Aim 1: To identify autoantibodies (ab) in plasma samples from acute SCI
patients to CNS autoantigens and determine the relationship between ab levels to the
development of NP.
R61 Phase Specific Aim 2: To identify the autoantibody combination with maximal prognostic
accuracy for the development of NP at 6 months after SCI.
R33 Phase Specific Aim 3: Develop and optimize an assay to simultaneously measure
several autoantibodies (to be determined during R61) and independently validate the prognostic
efficacy for NP using plasma samples collected prospectively.
The research will use banked and prospectively enrolled samples from SCI patients and healthy
controls. Subjects' pain phenotypes will be carefully characterized. Techniques capitalizing on
antibody-antigen binding will be used to optimize an autoantibody biomarker signature
predictive of neuropathic pain.
Establishing a panel will refine the prognostic value of these autoantibodies as biomarkers in
order to detect those who are vulnerable to developing neuropathic pain with high reliability and
may be used to facilitate the future development of non-addictive pain therapeutics."
10800725,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Overall)
Major depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety disorders are major public health problems characterized by
blunted approach-related behaviors and increased avoidance, which predict worse disease trajectories,
increased suicide risk, and poor treatment response. Despite this compelling evidence, little is known about the
neurobiological mechanisms underlying abnormal approach-avoidance behavior in these disorders, which has
hampered treatment development. To address this unmet need, we propose an integrated research program
through a unified Conte Center that will investigate the role of cortico-striatal-midbrain and nociceptin circuitry
in approach-avoidance behaviors. The goals will be to identify novel treatment targets and markers that map
disease course. These goals will be achieved by bringing together a highly interdisciplinary team with
complementary expertise and an established record of successful collaboration. The team will tackle pivotal
questions through a highly coordinated approach that will entail numerous conceptual and technological
innovations. Guided by a large amount of preliminary data, the proposed approach spans different species
(mice, non-human primates, humans), approaches (non-invasive neuroimaging, intracortical recordings and
deep brain stimulation in humans; optogenetics, chemogenetics techniques, and CRISPR-cas9 knockdown in
non-human animals), and units of analyses (genes, molecules, cells, circuits, physiology, behavior, self-report).
Critically, to increase translational impact, functionally identical tasks will be used and identical molecular
targets will be probed across three species. The Computational Modeling Core will test whether specific
states (e.g., MDD, anxiety, stress-induced depressive phenotypes) or pharmacological manipulations (e.g.,
nociceptin receptor antagonists) have similar effects on model parameters across species, which is expected
to improve the likelihood of successful translation. The unifying hypotheses are that: (1) MDD, anxiety
disorders are characterized by negative biases in approach/avoidance behaviors; (2) Negative biases in
approach/avoidance behaviors are linked to dysfunction in cortico-striatal-midbrain circuitry and nociceptin
system upregulation; and (3) nociceptin receptor antagonists and modulation of cortico-striatal-midbrain
circuitry will normalize approach/avoidance behaviors. These innovative hypotheses will be pursued through
four closely intertwined Projects supported by an Administrative Core and a Computational Modeling
Core. This unified research program will make unique contributions towards three NIMH Strategic Objectives:
(1) A better understanding of the pathophysiology of mental illness (NIMH Strategic Objective 1.1); (2)
Identification of novel treatment targets (Strategic Objective 3.1); and (3) Identification of markers that map
disease course (Strategic Objective 2.2). Thus, the significance and impact of the knowledge generated by
the Center will be substantial, as we aim to transform our understanding of the pathophysiology of two
disorders that affect >35% of the US population, which is a necessary step towards more effective treatments."
10816436,"In four scientific Projects and three Cores, we propose to study how Aβ and tau become prions causing neurodegenerative diseases. The term “prion” was originally defined for the prion protein (PrP), in which a largely α-helical cellular isoform undergoes a structural transition to a β-sheet rich form that is able to self-catalyze a conformational transition within the cellular PrP isoform. It is now understood that protein conformational propagation is a fundamental biological principle that underlies functions as diverse as phenotypic traits in yeast as well as synaptic plasticity and memory in humans. It is also the general mechanism by which a range of proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), are able to spread through the brain of the host. Stopping this propagation could lead to a new field of therapeutics that slow or halt AD and related neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). In this P01 renewal application, we plan to study the molecular biology, biophysics and structure of Aβ and tau prions. In Project 1, we propose to expand our prion bioassays of brains from AD and Down syndrome (DS) patients. DS studies offer brains from much younger patients than those from AD, which will likely diminish age-dependent artifacts. We plan to determine how strains of Aβ and tau prions produce different disease outcomes, and how different genetic modifiers impact neuropathogenesis. We will also test these findings experimentally in a range of novel transgenic (Tg) mouse and human embryonic stem cell models. Based on our recent findings of Aβ and tau prions in AD and DS brains, we may be able to develop a blood test for AD. In Project 2 we will apply multiple techniques to further determine the molecular basis of prion strain differences and better understand the fidelity of their propagation, in addition to studying how mutations in proteins associated with AD impact Aβ sequestration and processing. Project 2 will also provide broad-ranging biophysical and chemical biological approaches to generate structural information for integration in Project 4. Structural studies using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) will be performed in Project 3 to provide high-resolution data of Aβ and tau prions, and complexes with associated proteins. These will be done both with samples generated in vitro using recombinant proteins and synthetic peptides, and from proteins and complexes purified from in vivo sources. Project 4 will generate data using small-angle X-ray scattering and soft X-ray tomography, and integrate these data with all structural, biochemical and biophysical data from Projects 1–3, to generate structural models from the atomic to cellular scale. These models will then be further refined via iteration with Projects 1–3. The Projects will be supported by an Administrative Core to coordinate interactions among investigators, a Proteomics & Biophysics Core including expert support for mass spectrometry, and an Animals Core that will provide the highest level of animal production, procedures and care. Together the Projects and Cores will interact to proceed with research more rapidly than any individual group could hope to achieve alone."
10874513,"The overall hypothesis of the Triglycerides, Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease Program Project is that
abnormal metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins driven by specific proteins—APOC3, ANGPTL3,
PLTP, and LPL—promotes the accumulation of highly atherogenic remnant lipoprotein particles in
patients with diabetes, even in those with normal triglyceride levels. Remnant lipoprotein particles and
associated abnormalities in HDL contribute to cardiovascular disease risk by altering macrophage
functions, thereby promoting atherogenesis and increasing cardiovascular disease risk in diabetes.
We propose that the increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) associated with diabetes can be
understood, prevented, and treated only by increasing our knowledge of the factors that regulate triglyceride-
rich lipoproteins (TRLs) and their remnant lipoprotein particles (RLPs) and associated macrophage
phenotypes. TRLs and their remnants comprise a great variety of nascent and metabolically derived particles
differing in size, protein composition, and lipid content, which has made it difficult to identify the mechanisms
that promote atherosclerosis. We plan to address this complexity by focusing on specific pathways and
proteins and by using unique analytical tools. We believe that a highly interactive and interdisciplinary group of
investigators with extensive expertise in this area, such as ours, is needed to answer the question of how TRLs
and RLPs promote CVD risk. The expertise of our team in different aspects pertaining to the overall
hypotheses of this Program Project will ensure synergy and cross-fertilization between Projects, which is likely
to markedly advance research in this important and timely area. Importantly, the RLPs and proteins that control
them are amenable to therapeutic intervention. We therefore believe that our projects will provide new insights
into the pathogenesis of CVD in diabetes and suggest new ways to target and prevent the increased CVD risk
in this large population. The Program Project Grant consists of four Projects and three Core units:
 Project 1: Diabetes, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, and advanced atherosclerosis – Karin E. Bornfeldt,
 PhD, Project Leader
 Project 2: Regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism by ANGPTL3 in humans – Nathan Stitziel, MD,
 PhD, Project Leader
 Project 3: Lipolysis regulation and diabetes-impaired regression – Ira J. Goldberg, MD, Project Leader
 Project 4: Lipoproteins and CVD risk in diabetes – Jay W. Heinecke, MD, Project Leader
 Core A: Administrative Core – Karin E. Bornfeldt, PhD, Core Director
 Core B: Proteomics and lipoprotein characterization core – Tomas Vaisar, PhD, Core Director
 Core C: Myeloid cell and atherosclerosis core – Jenny E. Kanter, PhD, Core Director"
10897290,"Mechanisms of Norovirus Pathogenesis and Replication to Develop Therapeutics
Project Summary
Noroviruses are the most common cause of gastroenteritis in the United States, and they cause a significant
economic and health burden to the population. A significant barrier to progress in making effective therapeutics,
antivirals and vaccines to control human norovirus illness was the previous lack of a cell culture system. The focus
of this program project is to build upon previous basic science and translational findings and discoveries to allow
continued progress in our understanding of the biology and pathogenesis of these viruses so that improved
control strategies can be developed. We recently developed a successful replication system that discovered strain-
specific requirements for replication and allows neutralization assays and antivirals to be tested. We will pursue key
questions on virus pathogenesis and cellular responses, structure-function studies on the interactions between
virus proteins and host components, discover key factors that restrict extensive propagation and test antivirals
and neutralizing antibodies in three separate projects. In Project 1 we will perform studies designed to provide
us with a fundamental molecular understanding of how human noroviruses cause disease, and of what epitopes
are recognized by human sera that are associated with virus neutralization, virus clearance, and protective
immunity. In addition, we will build on recent success and continue to develop antivirals for treatment and prevention
strategies that can be applied to at risk populations. In Project 2 we will continue to improve the cultivation system,
focusing on identifying the cell receptor(s) and understanding why all HuNoV strains do not grow in the replication
system. We will also evaluate molecular mechanisms by which norovirus replication regulates cellular innate
responses and whether these cellular responses regulate viral replication and spread. In Project 3 we will
determine the structural basis for novel functions of key proteins that regulate viral replication and virus-host
interactions to provide a rational framework for the development of antivirals. These projects will be supported
by three cores. Core A (Administrative Core) will provide centralized administrative and fiscal management
support and will coordinate programmatic activities. Core B (the Microscopy and Enteroid Core) will provide
expertise and services to each project related to electron microscopy and fluorescent microscopy. This core will
also maintain and provide enteroids, including genetically-modified cultures and biosensor lines to all projects.
Core C (the Protein and Small Molecule Chemistry Core) will provide all projects with access to purified proteins
and virus-like particles as well as facilitating site-directed mutagenesis activities needed. In addition, the Core will
synthesize small molecules to be used for protease and polymerase inhibition studies in each project. The program
project brings together a highly collaborative group of investigators with diverse skills and talents, and an
substantial history of working together. As in the previous funding period, the interactions among each project
and each of the cores will be extensive and synergistic such that the activities of each project will be enhanced
considerably over what could be accomplished if the projects were pursued independently."
10889924,"Frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) is an understudied clinical neurodegenerative condition that is the most
common dementia after Alzheimer disease (AD) in people younger than 65. The most common pathology
associated with FTD is frontotemporal lobar degeneration due to transactive DNA/RNA binding protein of ~43
kD (TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and this is also the underlying pathology in the vast majority of patients who have
co-occurring amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FTD-ALS) spectrum disorders as well as a critical force in age-
related disorders such as limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE). Since discovering a
role for TDP-43 pathology in human disease, important progress has been made in experimental cellular and
animal models of disease. However, the human brain has many unique properties associated with distinctly
human clinical disorders that are not easily replicated in these experimental models. Major gaps in knowledge
thus constrain the development of disease-modifying treatment trials. Among these is our limited knowledge of
the pathophysiologic consequences of the accumulation and progression of abnormal TDP-43 at a molecular
level. At a microscopic level, a major limitation is that most patients with accumulating TDP-43 have sporadic
disease that can be identified reliably only at autopsy, although ~20% of cases have familial FTLD (fFTLD) with
known pathology during life. We are limited at translating this knowledge to a macroscale level where FTLD-
TDP pathology is manifested in humans with heterogeneous clinical features as diverse as emotional
dysregulation and impaired language both with and without a motor disorder. Moreover, there is limited
knowledge of the factors contributing to the highly varying rates of disease progression. In five novel,
independent but synergistic Projects and five Cores that support each of the Projects, this unique,
multidisciplinary, Program Project Grant (PPG) adopts the innovative perspective of investigating the
TDP-43-associated breakdown of neural networks at molecular, microscopic and macroscale levels in
humans. We hypothesize that our novel, well-integrated, network perspective will fill major gaps in
knowledge by elucidating mechanistic insights into the pathophysiology of abnormal TDP-43 and the
associated pattern of disease progression, and offer a fresh perspective on the identification of
accumulating TDP-43 pathology during life and its longitudinal course. This proposal is consistent with
the highest priorities for FTD at the 2019 Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders (ADRD) summit. By
focusing on disruption of neural networks at molecular, microscopic and macroscale levels of brain functioning,
our multidisciplinary network approach will elucidate the pathophysiology and spread of abnormal TDP-43 in
humans, and examine the consequences of TDP-43 pathology for clinical disease during life in dementia and
aging using fresh approaches to improve our mechanistic understanding of TDP-43 pathology in humans while
maintaining the highest level of scientific rigor and contributing to urgent clinical needs such as treatment trials."
10902036,"ABSTRACT
Support is requested for an interdisciplinary effort to understand the key molecular and
developmental events that regulate blood and vascular cells in inflammation, hemostasis
and thrombosis with a focus on adhesive signaling. The four Projects will: 1) Test the
hypothesis that direct interactions between Rap1 and talin1 plays an important role in
platelet, leukocyte, and endothelial cell functions in inflammation, hemostasis and
thrombosis. 2) Use newly developed imaging modalities to enable quantitative dynamic
footprinting of the surface of neutrophils in contact with substrate to assess adhesion
receptor clustering and conformation in response to specific molecular adaptor-adhesion
receptor interactions. A particular focus is the structure-function of kindlin-3, the gene
mutated in human leukocyte adhesion deficiency Type 3, and its relationship to talin. 3)
An Early Stage Investigator will test the hypothesis that genetic inactivation of Krit1 or
Heg1 in adult mice will protect against experimental inflammation or thrombosis. In
collaboration with a structural biologist, he will extend studies to test the feasibility of
pharmacologically disrupting the HEG1-KRIT1 complex to mimic the effects of genetic
inactivation of these genes. 4) To assess the role of SHARPIN and associated
components of the LUBAC linear ubiquitination complex in the functions of platelets and
endothelial cells in inflammation, hemostasis, and thrombosis. This project will test the
hypothesis that this newly-identified regulator of platelet and endothelial cell functions
contributes to inflammation, hemostasis, and thrombosis. A scientific core unit, led by a
world leader in murine models of inflammation, hemostasis, and thrombosis, will provide
the individual projects with in vivo models and expertise required to establish the patho-
physiological relevance of these novel molecular mechanisms."
10834105,"OVERALL - PROJECT SUMMARY
The mission of the National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB) is to advance the science of biological
networks by creating leading-edge bioinformatic methods, software tools and infrastructure, and by engaging
the scientific community in a portfolio of collaboration and training opportunities. Much of biomedical research
is dependent on knowledge of biological networks of multiple types and scales, including molecular interactions
among genes, proteins, metabolites and drugs; cell communication systems; relationships among genotypes
and biological and clinical phenotypes; and patient and social networks. NRNB-supported platforms like
Cytoscape are among the most widely used software tools in biology, with tens of thousands of active users,
enabling researchers to apply network concepts and data to understand biological systems and how they are
reprogrammed in disease.
 NRNB’s three Technology Research and Development projects introduce innovative concepts with the
potential to transform network biology, transitioning it from a static to a dynamic science (TR&D 1); from flat
network diagrams to multi-scale hierarchies of biological structure and function (TR&D 2); and from descriptive
interaction maps to predictive and interpretable machine learning models (TR&D 3). In previous funding
periods our technology projects have produced novel and highly cited approaches, including network-based
biomarkers for stratification of disease, data-driven gene ontologies assembled completely from network data,
and deep learning models of cell structure and function built using biological networks as a scaffold.
 During the next period of support, we introduce dynamic regulatory networks formulated from single-cell
transcriptomics and advanced proteomics data (TR&D 1); substantially improved methodology for the study of
hierarchical structure and pleiotropy in biological networks (TR&D 2); and procedures for using networks to
seed machine learning models of drug response that are both mechanistically interpretable and transferable
across biomedical contexts (TR&D 3). These efforts are developed and applied in close collaboration with
outside investigators from 19 Driving Biomedical Projects who specialize in experimental generation of network
data, disease biology (cancer, neuropsychiatric disorders, diabetes), single-cell developmental biology, and
clinical trials. TR&Ds are also bolstered by 7 Technology Partnerships in which NRNB scientists coordinate
technology development with leading resource-development groups in gene function prediction, mathematics
and algorithm development, and biomedical databases. Beyond these driving collaborations, we continually
support a broader portfolio of transient (non-driving) research collaborations; organize and lead international
meetings including the popular Network Biology track of the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology
conference; and deliver a rich set of training opportunities and network analysis protocols."
10878851,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 As the aging pyramid squares, healthcare systems face unprecedented numbers of older adults living with
serious chronic illness, escalating costs, and reductions in available caregivers. These challenges are greatly
magnified in the setting of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). Living with ADRD is
characterized by physical and psychosocial suffering, mismatches between patient goals of care and
treatments received; high physical, psychological, and financial burdens on families and the health system.
This program project, Deploying High Value Longitudinal Population-based data in Dementia Research
(DEVELOP AD RESEARCH), breaks new ground by employing rich population-based data to develop a
comprehensive longitudinal understanding of dementia that will better inform clinical and policy interventions
and improve healthcare for persons with dementia and their families.
 Methodological constraints have limited the ability to examine the complex longitudinal interplay of medical,
social, and system factors known to influence health, healthcare, and quality of life and death for persons with
dementia. The need to enroll samples large enough to account for the population’s heterogeneity, the
necessity of gathering data from patients and caregivers across diverse care settings, difficulties collecting
social determinants of health data due to budgetary and primary data collection effort constraints, and a
duration of illness that exceeds standard 5-year grant funding periods have limited the ability to answer
important questions.
 The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) are
ongoing NIA funded population-based studies that contain rich longitudinal patient and family health, social,
and economic data and, through their linkages to CMS claims, comprehensive information on health service
utilization and costs. Due to their maturity, numbers of participants, retention rates, sampling frames, and
validated algorithms for identifying dementia, both datasets are now able to provide sufficient sample sizes,
variables, and longitudinal follow-up to begin to address existing gaps in dementia research. Marshalling pre-
existing resources and highly productive collaborations among project investigators, we break new ground by
proposing integrated research that examines the complex longitudinal interplay of medical, social, and system
factors known to influence health, healthcare, and quality of life and death for persons with dementia. Our five
research projects address major questions in dementia science whose answers demand the use of the
population-based data now available through NHATS and/or HRS. Our two resource cores support the
complex analytics required of each research project, integrate and coordinate research activities, disseminate
findings and data resources including programming code and data dictionaries, create a platform of research to
support early-stage investigators, and identify future directions and research collaborations."
10873704,"Overall Project Summary/Abstract
North Dakota is a large land mass, low population, agricultural state with only 755,393 citizens
occupying over 68,976 square miles. Thirty-six (36) of North Dakota’s 53 counties retain a Federal
designation as “Frontier Counties” since they contain less than 6 people per square mile.
A result of this environment was that the system of higher education offered very limited opportunity
for undergraduates to participate in biomedical research. The ND INBRE addressed this problem starting
in 2005 and has now successfully established undergraduate research at primarily undergraduate
institutions (PUIs), tribal colleges (TCUs), and at the University of North Dakota, a research intensive
university (RIU) and academic home of the ND INBRE. To date, over 1,000 students have participated in
undergraduate research, including 189 American Indian students. Over 85 M.D.’s and 77 Ph.D.’s are in
training or postgraduate service, including 8 American Indian M.D.’s and 5 American Indian Ph.D.’s.
Over 120 other graduates have entered the healthcare workforce. The undergraduate researchers have
produced and presented over 775 posters. The PUIs and TCUs have year-round research on their own
campuses. The ND INBRE has also provided over $5,000,000 in infrastructure to the PUI, TCU, and RIU
partners over the last 5 years. The ND INBRE has also promoted STEM in the middle and high schools of
ND by providing registration fees for students and their schools to compete in the Science and
Engineering Fair. To date, over 3,000 middle and high school students have taken advantage of this
support. In 2018, one student was awarded a scholarship valued at $250,000. These efforts clearly
fulfill the 4 primary goals of the INBRE program; 1) to provide research opportunities for students from
PUIs, CCs and TCUs and to serve as a ""pipeline"" for these students to pursue health research careers; 2)
to enhance science and technology knowledge of the state's workforce; and, 3/4) to build and increase
the research base and capacity to faculty, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students at participating
institutions. The ND INBRE intends to continue to build upon this firm foundation of success."

Overall
This application is to renew the NBER Center for Aging and Health Research for the next five years, continuing
its impactful role in advancing research on health and aging issues across a large multi-university consortium of
economics scholars. The Center has two primary aims. The first is to integrate into a unified programmatic
structure an extensive collection of ongoing research projects and related NBER activities on health at older
ages, most of which are supported by NIA through this and other grants. The second is to stimulate research
development on new topics in health and aging, systematically advancing the science toward the most pressing
questions of the day.
The themes of Center research are: (1) health trends and inequalities, (2) data analytics, information technology
and health care decision-making, (3) the economics of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, (4) the
dynamics of the health care ecosystem, and (5) medical innovation and the value of health care. Some of these
themes represent new priorities for research development at the Center, where the synergistic brainstorming of
collaborative networks can be harnessed, and pilot projects focused. Other themes have an established base of
ongoing work, making the Center’s role more integrative, stimulating interaction and collaboration across
research projects that are ongoing, and where their collective impact can be leveraged.
The administrative and research support core (Core A) provides intellectual leadership to the study of aging and
health issues, coordinates activities into an integrated programmatic effort, arranges meetings and conferences
that bring people together, manages a library of health-related databases, and administratively supports all
Center activities. The program development core (Core B) is composed of exploratory research on topics related
to the ongoing themes of the Center, or which lay the foundation for larger-scale projects under development.
The external innovative network core (Core C) creates opportunities and encouragement for investigators
working on similar research themes at different universities to meet, share ideas and findings, brainstorm,
collaborate and plan for the continuing development of their collective research agenda. The external research
resources and dissemination core (Core D) communicates the findings of Center research to a broad audience
through the NBER working paper series, non-technical articles and reports, the website and social media."
10868748,"Project Summary/Abstract
The Life Course Center (LCC) at the University of Minnesota is an emerging incubator for innovative research
on the demography and economics of aging. As an NIA-supported University-wide cooperative, LCC will recruit
and foster connections among researchers across disciplines; develop leading-edge collaborative pilot studies
on aging contexts, trends, dynamics, and disparities; provide technical and administrative support for research
development; and develop a research network to leverage large-scale population data to advance
interdisciplinary scholarship on social determinants and contexts of aging and health. Over the next five years,
we will focus on three research themes that are crucial to understanding the demography and economics of our
aging society. These themes leverage our intellectual strengths and unique resources: (1) Later Life-Course
Population Trends in Context: Determinants within and across space, time, and social location of population
trends at older ages in physical and cognitive functioning (including AD/ADRD), disability, morbidity, mortality,
health and well-being.
(2) Life-Course Dynamics as Disparity Mechanisms: How life-course pathways foster
disparities in healthy aging, including protective factors (e.g., social engagement and support, income adequacy,
positive early determinants, and health behaviors).
(3) Interrelationships of Work, Family, Community
Participation, and Health: Consequences of later life work, family and community participation for health
outcomes of older workers and retirees. We will establish three infrastructure cores to overcome key barriers to
path-breaking research: Core A: Administrative and Research Support Core. This Core will provide leadership
and vision, as well as logistical support and oversight for the activities of the other two Cores. This Core will also
be responsible for meeting all reporting requirements to the Coordinating Center. Core B: Program Development
Core. LCC will support small-scale, innovative interdisciplinary research projects. The Core will annually fund
four to six outstanding pilot projects proposed by LCC members and from members of the External Innovative
Network Core. The proposed pilot program will prioritize support of early career investigators as well as
investigators from historically underrepresented groups. Core C: External Innovative Network Core. The Network
will foster an interdisciplinary community of researchers focusing on the demography and economics of aging
who will share knowledge and resources for using big population data and for applying a life-course perspective
to aging research. The Network Core will address challenges associated with big population data, prospective
longitudinal data based on record linkage, and restricted access data."
11041209,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Although many evidence-based interventions have been identified to address the consequences of the
opioid epidemic in the United States, much less progress has made been toward preventing the initiation of
opioid misuse and the development of opioid use disorder (OUD). Recognizing the urgent need to fill this
gap in knowledge, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) is launching the HEAL Preventing Opioid
Misuse and Opioid Use Disorder in Older Adolescents and Young Adults Initiative. Ten research projects
(RPs), one coordinating center (CC), the steering committee (SC), and NIDA and other federal staff will
collaborate to evaluate evidence-based prevention and intervention services for older adolescents and
young adults across diverse settings and populations. We recognize that this important and complex
endeavor requires exceptional coordination across a range of activities inherent to multi-site consortia.
 We propose a CC to facilitate cross-site activities and provide centralized support for the HEAL
Prevention Collaborative (HPC). Our CC has five Specific Aims. We will provide centralized operational,
administrative, and logistical infrastructure to facilitate consortium coordination and communication (Aim 1).
We will provide implementation science expertise to understand the delivery and adaptation of evidence-
based interventions within different programmatic settings (Aim 2). We will establish an infrastructure for
cross-site data collection, management, harmonization, and data sharing (Aim 3). We will provide expert
methodological and statistical consultation (Aim 4). We will conduct rigorous economic evaluation to guide
decisionmakers in choosing prevention strategies that produce the greatest impact (Aim 5).
 Our CC team is led by multiple Principal Investigators—Drs. Phillip Graham and Kevin Conway—who are
experienced leaders of multi-site studies and experts in consensus building, data harmonization, program
evaluation, and addiction etiology. The broader team of Core leaders, key staff, and consultants brings
robust scientific and implementation science skills interwoven with a deep understanding of the opioid crisis,
prevention science, and the economics of opioid misuse and addiction. We offer proven computational
infrastructure and statistical expertise to support all the required data management and analysis needs for
the consortium. We are backed by RTI's unsurpassed experience and proficiency—born from successful
leadership of over 40 other CCs—to ensure that we support and accomplish the aims. Collectively, we are
well-prepared to apply prevention science concepts to the Nation's approach to the opioid crisis."

The overarching goal of the Oregon Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (OADRC) is twofold: (1) to focus on
early detection of change in order to define mechanisms supporting healthy brain aging and the transition to
MCI and early dementia, and (2) to facilitate developing effective therapies to prevent or limit these transitions.
To achieve these objectives, eight cores and a Research Education Component are organized to catalyze and
sustain innovative research and discovery in Alzheimer Disease and related dementias (ADRD) through an
organizational infrastructure that supports a rich collaborative environment composed of leading edge
technologies and methods, multi-disciplinary scientists, empowered research volunteers, and an inspired
community of lay and professional stakeholders. The OADC provides the necessary materials to support
research through well-characterized research participants, biological specimens, brain tissue, data provision
and analytics. The OADRC focuses on specific areas of emphasis: 1) Preclinical dementia and activity of
disease emphasizing the oldest old; 2) Markers of meaningful change captured through studies of peripheral
biomarkers, neuroimaging and continuous in-home behavioral monitoring; 3) Neuropathology of brain aging
and late life dementia; 4) Novel testing of novel treatments, and 5) Improving education and sharing knowledge

10873138,"The advent of next generation DNA sequencing has revolutionized gene discovery in human diseases, including epilepsy. Hundreds of genes have been implicated in epilepsy in the last decade, revealing the diversity of biological mechanisms that can go awry in this disorder. However, the rate at which we are identifying new genes involved in epilepsy is now outpacing our ability to study disease mechanisms. Moreover, clinical gene panel or exome sequencing has become standard practice for patients with early-onset, familial, and refractory epilepsies. This rapid assimilation of genetic testing into clinical care has led to a surge in the number of genetic variants of uncertain significance (VUS), particularly the occurrence of missense VUS. These VUS are assigned to an indeterminate spectrum between pathogenic and benign, which complicate interpretation for genetic counselors, clinicians, patients and families, as well as assessment of the need for further testing. Here we propose a Center without Walls, entitled Epilepsy Multiplatform Variant Prediction (EpiMVP), spanning 5 institutions and incorporating expertise from geneticists, clinicians, computational biologists, neuroscientists, stem cell biologists, pharmacologists and electrophysiologists who have a proven track record of collaborative publications and grants, as well as stature as leaders of national and international epilepsy organizations. EpiMVP will develop a modular, highly integrated platform approach to accelerate determination of the functional, pharmacological, neuronal network and whole animal consequences of genetic variants implicated in a range of clinical epilepsy types. We will study non-ion-channel, non-receptor genes commonly implicated in epilepsy, and that are involved in diverse biological processes. Our ultimate goals are to devise an effective experimental platform for testing the pathogenicity of VUS in genes implicated in epilepsy and to generate a computational model (EpiPred) that predicts the likelihood that a variant is pathogenic or benign. This work is crucial in the pursuit of novel therapeutics and the promise of personalized medicine. The overall milestones of the Center are: 1. Evaluate genes associated with epilepsy and select candidates for analysis, model data for, and analyze all project data for development of EpiPred an iterative machine learning model to classify variants in genes implicated in epilepsy. 2. Test selected VUS using medium throughput, in vitro approaches. 3. Test selected VUS in human cortical neurons or human brain organoids using induced pluripotent stem cell approaches. 4. Test selected VUS in pre-clinical, in vivo models. The expected outcomes are: 1. Provide a freely available prediction tool for clinicians to differentiate between pathogenic and benign variants for genes implicated in epilepsy; 2. Provide experimental models to study the functional consequences of specific variants; 3. Provide a reclassification of VUS in ClinVar/ClinGen and to develop new guidelines for incorporating functional readouts into the ACMG criteria; 4. Inform the future development of novel therapeutics to treat epilepsy."

Project Summary/Abstract
The central theme of the University of California, Irvine Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (UCI ADRC) is
to identify, quantify, and validate factors that influence the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) across the lifespan.
Given its diverse and multifactorial nature, it is critical to understand the etiology and progression of this
insidious brain disorder at multiple dimensions, including clinically and neuropathologically, and to employ
novel scientific approaches so that we can advance knowledge and better diagnose, prevent and cure the
disease. The UCI ADRC has a strong history of integrating basic, clinical, and translational science to gain
insights into AD pathogenesis and to help meet some of the goals of the National Alzheimer's Project Act.
First, our Center has a distinguished record of studying the disease in diverse patient cohorts: Uniform Data
Set (UDS) Cohort, which includes cognitively normal individuals and individuals with mild cognitive impairment
(prodromal AD); adults with Down syndrome, representing the largest genetically at-risk population for AD; and
90+, which show great disparity between AD pathology and cognitive loss and are among the oldest group of
individuals to develop AD. Together, these cohorts enable interrogation of important novel questions related to
age, susceptibility and resilience, using innovative outcomes ranging from in vivo biomarker characterization to
modern pathological outcomes such as post-mortem imaging and microglial staining. Second, the UCI ADRC
has a history of innovation that has helped advance the field; the development of the nation's first induced
pluripotent stem cell bank for AD as part of the ADRC network and our recently established Consent-to-
Contact recruitment registry are recent examples of this innovation. Third, our Center continues to evolve.
Given the expertise, productivity, and resources devoted the study of special populations at UCI, we have
initiated two Special Populations Cores, one focused on Down syndrome and one focused on the oldest old
(90+). These Cores will interact with the other cores of the ADRC to produce novel data and resources
available to ADRC investigators, including through our newly established Biomarker Core. Finally, we have
established a new Research and Education Component in this proposal, which harnesses the long-standing
passionate commitment to training the next generation of clinicians and scientists at UCI. In sum, the UCI
ADRC brings energetic and innovative multi-dimensional and multidisciplinary approaches toward addressing
the national epidemic of AD."

The University of Texas at Austin requests P30 funding to establish a new Center on the Demography and
Economics of Aging—The Center on Aging and Population Sciences (CAPS). The new Center’s
overarching mission is to galvanize novel research that illuminates how biosocial and environmental factors
intersect, compound, and cascade throughout the life course to shape health and well-being at older ages.
CAPS will provide specialized programming and leadership to foster innovative demographic and population-
based research on aging. The Center will leverage substantial faculty strengths and new institutional
commitments to greatly amplify the impact of NIA P30 support. CAPS will share administrative resources with
the highly successful Population Research Center (PRC) at UT Austin. The extensive experience and expertise
of PRC administrators and staff will multiply the impact of CAPS activities to promote exceptional population-based
research on aging. The Center’s specific aims are: 1) Expand and promote collaborations among scholars to
address complex aging and population health issues, create a lively and supportive interdisciplinary community
wherein exchange of ideas is encouraged and common, and grow the number and diversity of researchers in
the field at all career stages, 2) Promote and sustain infrastructure development needed to provide high-quality
services and resources to foster outstanding population-based research on aging, and 3) Oversee a project
development and pilot program to seed new lines of population-based research on aging.
Over the next 5 years, CAPS will address critical research questions regarding dynamic and intersecting
factors throughout the life course that shape diversity in aging and health within three overarching research
themes: 1) Life course precursors of advantage and disadvantage at older ages, 2) Family demography, social
engagement, and social isolation, and 3) Place, aging, and health. Funding is requested for two infrastructure
cores. The Administrative and Research Suppoert Core will set programmatic and service priorities; build an
interdisciplinary community of population scientists at the University; provide outstanding services that facilitate
the development of large-scale population research; ensure coordination between cores, and serve as the
communications hub between CAPS, NIA, and the Coordinating Center. The Program Development and Pilot
Core will generate novel scientific projects of well-established scientists as well as early-stage and new-to-
aging scholars to significantly advance population-based research on aging; build CAPS research portfolio via
the Center’s pilot project program, and foster evolution of nascent ideas into proposals for extramural funding.
CAPS will prioritize pilot projects that are most likely to advance knowledge, address NIA priorities, shift
conceptual paradigms, develop novel sources of data, and lead to major NIA funding within CAPS themes."

We propose the Carolina Center for Population Aging and Health (CCPAH), which will provide
resources and organization to support a productive group of scholars as they increase the pace
and focus of their research on topics related to the demography and economics of aging. The
potential for CCPAH to make important contributions to aging research lies in the combination of
people, their analytical skills and ability to combine different sources of data in innovative ways,
and the array of data sets with information on mid-life and older individuals that have been
designed and collected by faculty associated with the proposed center. Our faculty have
developed and fielded a number of long-running population-based longitudinal surveys that
provide rich data for analysis of questions related to aging across a wide array of diverse
settings. CCPAH will provide important resources to the field of aging research by continuing to
innovate on measurement in these surveys and in new ones and on linkage of these surveys to
other administrative and contextual data, ensuring that the content of these surveys is state-of-
the-art. Resources from a P30 will support three Cores. An Administrative and Research Core
will create an environment that fosters collaboration and provides faculty with administrative and
research support so that they can focus on the science. A Project Development Pilot Core will
support pilot projects and assist with the development of proposals to NIH. A Remote Data
Enclave Core will build infrastructure to provide access to data in a secure but convenient way.
In combination these three cores will help CCPAH faculty produce cutting edge research in the
areas of our themes: aging in diverse contexts, relationships between economic and social
productivity and health, and measurement and methods. Each core supports each of the
themes. Over the course of the grant CCPAH faculty will design primary data collection efforts,
continue and begin new analyses of secondary data, as well as data they have collected, and
oversee the production and dissemination of data products through a P30-supported Remote
Data Enclave. These public goods will enrich the data to which researchers around the world
have access to advance science on aging."

 This proposal will continue to pursue the primary goals of the Arkansas IDeA Network for Biomedical
Research Excellence (INBRE) to expand biomedical research capacity in Arkansas. Building upon
infrastructure developed during the earlier BRIN/INBRE phases, two research-intensive, lead institutions in the
state—the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) and the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville
(UAF) will provide scientific leadership. The focus of the Developmental Research Project Program will be to
expand the number of faculty at primarily undergraduate institutions (PUI) engaged in biomedical research.
This will be accomplished by assisting PUIs with faculty recruitments, providing research funding, and
supporting the career development of PUI faculty. Arkansas INBRE-supported research led by PUI faculty will
be carried out in collaboration with their mentors at the lead institutions under the overall theme of Cellular
Signaling, Growth, and Differentiation. The Administrative Core will provide operational support and coordinate
all Arkansas INBRE activities, and the Outreach Core will broaden opportunities for undergraduate student
participation in research. The accomplishments of undergraduate researchers across the state will be
showcased at an annual conference attended by all Arkansas INBRE faculty and students. The Arkansas
INBRE will continue its commitment to expand opportunities for underrepresented groups, partnering with the
UAMS Center for Diversity Affairs and NIH-funded Initiative for Maximizing Student Development Program to
increase the numbers of underrepresented students completing graduate degrees in the biomedical sciences.
Communication among INBRE participants will be facilitated by a teleconferencing network and a Social Media
Hub. The Bioinformatics Core will be a statewide research and educational resource to give undergraduate
faculty and students access to the computational tools needed for multidisciplinary biomedical research and
will continue to play a central role in training the next generation of bioinformaticians. The Arkansas INBRE will
support a Research Technology Core that will provide PUI investigators access to sophisticated
instrumentation and technical expertise difficult to establish at small institutions. In collaboration with the
Oklahoma INBRE, the IDeA National Resource for Proteomics will provide IDeA investigators with proteomics
data and access to core personnel for data interpretation and analysis, and it will offer annual workshops
focused on training with cutting-edge proteomics techniques. Through further enhancement of research
infrastructure, particularly at undergraduate institutions, the Arkansas INBRE will continue to improve the ability
of academic researchers to make discoveries that improve human health, increase the number of
undergraduate students who choose careers in biomedical research, and stimulate the growth of biotechnical
industries in Arkansas."

Core (CRI), a Science, Technology, Competency and Education Core (STCE), and a Developmental Research
Projects Program (DRPP). The PR-INBRE network has made great strides in the development of the research
enterprise at several network institutions during the current funding period (2015-2020). In the next cycle, we
will continue to enhance professional growth of PUI early career stage faculty and we will place greater
emphasis on training of postdoctoral associates through not only financial support of meritorious research
proposals from this group but also increased professional exposure and networking opportunities outside of
Puerto Rico. This would be accomplished through seminar presentations co-sponsored by other INBREs, and
improvement of the quality of their research proposals through sustained grant-writing workshops for R15 and
R21 proposals and editorial support. Scientific infrastructure and instrumentation at PUIs will also continue to
be upgraded every year through a PR-INBRE small instrumentation program for teaching and research labs. In
the next cycle, student support will continue to be a top priority of the PR-INBRE through research experiences
in funded laboratories and mentoring with the goal of directing them to seek graduate studies and Postdoctoral
positions in biomedicine. Overall, the improvements to the institutional environment of the network PUIs to date
can be associated with increased research capacity as measured by the number of successful high-quality
research proposals submitted to external federal and non-federal funding sources, and published manuscripts
in peer-reviewed journals by the PR-INBRE PUI investigators. Continuation of this valuable and essential
support for the next cycle is well justified to sustain the continuous growth and maturation of this thriving
INBRE network in Puerto Rico."
10788389,"Overall: Summary/Abstract:
The University of Pittsburgh Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (PITT-
ADRC) has shown a clear scientific evolution over the past three decades. Since our inception, we have
advanced the areas of AD neuropsychiatry, genetics, natural history of AD, validation of clinical criteria, and
clinico-pathological correlations, and have pioneered the development of PET amyloid tracers, which have
transformed AD research. We have used a multidisciplinary approach to better understand the transition from
normal cognition to dementia, have explored the biology of more aggressive forms of AD characterized by
psychosis, and have made and contributed to new insights in genetics. This solid scientific background and
investment in junior investigators has allowed the PITT-ADRC to develop areas of excellence, which form the
foundation of our Center going forward. These are reflected in the Center’s cores, and most notably in the
large number of studies we support in these areas in Pittsburgh and at national and international level.
 The PITT-ADRC is committed to remain at the forefront of the scientific efforts to understand the
pathological processes involved in the etiology of AD. Along with the high level of research conducted by the
PITT-ADRC, we are also dedicated to developing strong training programs to promote the careers of young
investigators, consolidate the career of midlevel investigators, and to create strong ties with the community
through educational and support programs.
 The PITT-ADRC is highly committed to leverage the strengths of the network of Centers to provide large
numbers of samples and standardized clinical data collection from our participants. The PITT-ADRC has
designed novel methodology that improves the accessibility of its database to local and national researchers,
and it has been a key player in multiple studies that advanced the understanding of AD pathology and its
possible implications for the development of novel treatments and other symptoms. Therefore, we provide an
excellent environment that enhances cutting-edge research by bringing together a multidisciplinary team of
investigators to study AD and other dementias, and to improve health care delivery.
 The methodology proposed in this application will lead us to the creation of a unique and well-characterized
cohort of patients and normal control subjects assessed with state of the art clinical and biomarker methods.
This will allow us to test multiple scientific hypotheses and to examine the short- and long-term public health
outcomes of the pathophysiology of cognitive disorders in the adult.
 We believe that the PITT -ADRC will be at the center of the new era of AD research that will require a
wealth of clinical and biological data, highly sophisticated biomarker methodologies, close inter-relationship
among centers and institutions, creation and optimization of human resources, and enhanced communication
with patients and families."
10886683,"Project Summary (Overall)
The Duke Center for Population Health and Aging (CPHA) will continue to support an
interdisciplinary environment to develop faculty in aging research and to foster important
scientific breakthroughs, particularly in the overlapping areas of biodemography (i.e. biological
and biomedical demography of aging), life course studies of health and well-being across the
lifespan, and intergenerational studies including the transmission of health and longevity. These
activities will be supported by an infrastructure consisting of four integrated cores: (i) a strong
Administrative and Research Support Core (Core A) that provides central cohesive clerical,
technical, event planning and research support services including pre-award and post-award
grants and project management; (ii) programming in a Development Core (Core B) that
sponsors peer-reviewed pilot research initiatives and interactions with invited experts from
around the world; (iii) innovative inter-institutional networks of collaboration in research and
training both in the region and beyond focused on comparative animal models of aging in an
External Networks Core (Core C); and (iv) the rapid design and testing of methods aimed at
accelerating transfer of research to practice to create cost efficiencies in Core D."
10886759,"Project Abstract (Overall)
The population with Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) globally is expected to nearly
triple by 2050. With few effective treatments either to prevent the disease or slow its progression, we are
currently limited to managing established disease and minimizing further negative outcomes, at a cost of $200
billion per year. The National Alzheimer’s Project Act (NAPA) was passed with the goal of reducing the burden
of AD/ADRD, not just for persons with dementia but also for the society at large, including the social,
economic, and health system effects. There are large gaps in our knowledge about how policy-makers, public
health planners and healthcare organizations can best prepare for and respond to the broad population effects
of AD/ADRD as we await a cure. The proposed Center to Accelerate Population Research in Alzheimer’s
(CAPRA) at the University of Michigan will be focused on science that informs government and healthcare
organization actions to address the negative impacts of dementia on the health and financial well-being of
individuals and the population. Our focus on public policy and healthcare for persons with dementia falls into
four inter-related themes: 1) healthcare delivery and policy impact on outcomes and quality of care, 2) diffusion
of new technologies, 3) disparities in quality and access to care, and 4) innovative applications of population
data that inform allocation of resources and program development. The CAPRA leadership team is uniquely
positioned to leverage its own expertise across these themes and the depth of institutional expertise at the
University of Michigan across health services, economic, and population research to accelerate and expand
population-based observational AD/ADRD research. The overarching goal for CAPRA is that it will serve as a
national resource to enable and expand research by current and future leaders in the study of healthcare
delivery, economics, and policies to reduce the burden of AD/ADRD locally, nationally, and internationally. To
do so, the Center will act as an “on-ramp” to fast-track junior and established investigators transitioning into
AD/ADRD research by funding pilot studies, providing research training and tools, giving access to unique
secondary data relevant to AD/ADRD, and developing networks of experts with whom to consult and
collaborate. CAPRA seeks to become the leading national resource to promote and accelerate studies that aim
to reduce the social, economic, and health burden of AD/ADRD on the population. The research that emanates
from this new Center will have real-world implications for health systems, payers, and policymakers as they
struggle with designing effective policies to improve outcomes for the growing population with or at risk for
AD/ADRD."
10867513,"Project Summary/Abstract for the Center for Aging and Policy Studies (CAPS)
The overarching goal of the Center for Aging and Policy Studies (CAPS) is to improve the health, well-being,
and independence of older adults by directly addressing some of today’s most pressing issues facing middle-
age and older adults and the families that care for them. Scientific research at CAPS focuses on two signature
themes of health and well-being and family and intergenerational supports and three cross-cutting themes
of policy, place, and specific populations. These signature themes are long-standing and essential areas of
study, while the cross-cutting themes have emerged as critical determinants of older adult health, well-being,
and independence. Significantly, by emphasizing policy and place as cross-cutting themes, CAPS brings a
distinctive and vital dimension to the NIA Centers on the Demography and Economics of Aging program. The
innovative organizational approach of CAPS provides a firm foundation for achieving its overarching goal. First,
CAPS will use a hub-and-spoke operational model encompassing three R1 institutions in Upstate New York with
a long history of collaboration on the demography and economics of aging. Syracuse University will serve as the
hub, with nearby Cornell University and the University at Albany–State University of New York as the spokes.
Guided by state-of-the-art principles of collaborative management, this model combines the benefits of both a
brick-and-mortar Center and a virtual network that is nimble, cost-effective, and wide-reaching. Second, CAPS
will have a strong, multi-disciplinary, five-person leadership team comprised of scientific leaders experienced in
directing NIH-funded Centers and cross-site programs. Third, CAPS will offer a strategically selected and tightly
coordinated set of activities across its Administrative Core, Pilot Core, and Dissemination Core. CAPS will
achieve its goal through three overall specific aims. Aim 1 is to foster innovative and interdisciplinary research
on CAPS signature and cross-cutting themes. CAPS will achieve this aim through multiple dynamic activities,
including its integrated pilot project program; teaming program featuring a research incubator; and visiting
scholars program. Aim 2 is to enhance human capital in population-based aging research among emerging,
underrepresented, and established scholars. CAPS will provide numerous opportunities for scientific
development among CAPS affiliates and non-affiliates, including an onsite-online colloquium series, grant writing
workshops, and workshops on new methods related to CAPS thematic areas. Aim 3 is to advance understanding
of the latest population-based aging research by disseminating findings and data resources to scientists,
practitioners, decision makers, and the public. CAPS will draw on the communications expertise at its three sites,
and their extensive social media reach, to disseminate information that is timely and broadly accessible.
Contributing to the greater scientific enterprise, CAPS will promote the use of its primary data collection through
data user sessions at national conferences and by coordinating with other NIA-funded Centers to link CAPS
place-based data to existing survey data on older adults."

The Johns Hopkins Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (JHADRC) is an integrated program of investigators
whose overarching goal is to improve understanding of the earliest phases of AD and to expand therapeutic
approaches. The overall scientific focus of the JHADRC is on the earliest stages of AD and related disorders in
humans and in model systems, through characterizing the earliest clinical and pathophysiological processes,
and by identifying cellular and molecular events that contribute to the abnormalities in model systems that
capture aspects of the human disorders. We also focus efforts on improving care of patients in the
symptomatic phases of disease. We have made substantial progress with these research goals during the
current funding cycle, supported by a P50 center grant, and propose to continue and expand this work in the
next funding cycle, through a P30 grant mechanism. The proposed Center consists of 6 Cores and one
component : (1) the Administrative Core (Core A), (2) the Clinical Core (Core B), (3) the Data Management and
Biostatistics Core (Core C), (4) the Neuropathology Core (Core D), (5) the Outreach, Recruitment and
Engagement Core (Core E), (6) the Biomarker Core (Core F) and (7) the Research Education Component
(REC). In this application we are also including funds for 3 Developmental Projects; we anticipate funding one
developmental project for 2 years and two developmental projects for 3 years each."
10829922,"Since its inception in 1990, the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) at New York University Langone
Health has facilitated pioneering research to define transitions from normal aging to the subjective cognitive
decline (SCD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and early dementia stages of AD; as well as AD biomarker
development. Here we propose to continue this long-standing successful research direction with a focus on
understanding disease heterogeneity and delineating biomarkers and their role in these transitions, with
the long-term goal of helping to develop novel interventions that will delay or prevent cognitive decline.
The NYU ADRC has built an infrastructure that supports innovative research on AD and related dementias
(ADRD) to help achieve the NAPA goal of a cure by 2025. This will be facilitated by our nine highly successful
and interactive Cores (Admin; Clinical; Data Management & Statistical [DMS]; Neuropathology; Outreach,
Education & Engagement [ORE]; Neuroimaging; Biomarker; Psychosocial; and Research Education Component
[REC]). Together, our highly integrated cores will achieve the following aims: Aim 1. Enhance the performance
of innovative research in ADRC by maintaining nine cores that focus on delineating biomarkers of the transitions
from normal aging to SCD, MCI, and early dementia, and determining their roles to help develop novel
interventions that delay or prevent these transitions. We will also facilitate training in this area. Aim 2. Contribute
to the national network of ADRCs by providing clinical data, autopsy diagnoses, neuroimaging and biosamples
to NACC and NCRAD, as well as to other research community collaborative efforts in ADRD. Aim 3. Recruit and
retain a diverse subject population from clinical and community settings, via the ORE and Psychosocial Cores,
with concomitant engagement of the local scientific and lay community in ADRD with seminars, poster sessions
and the developmental projects via the Admin, ORE, and REC Cores. Aim 4. Foster the development of novel
avenues of investigation with methodological developments by the cores (via innovative cognitive assessments,
neuroimaging techniques, biomarkers and proteomic approaches), and encourage, recruit, and select
developmental projects. Aim 5. Accelerate translational research across the ADRD spectrum by using
biomarkers to better define the underlying disease heterogeneity and foster the development of novel therapeutic
interventions that consider this heterogeneity. Aim 6. Facilitate the education and training of a diverse ADRD
workforce. Our Center will enhance the scientific community's understanding of ADRD and expand the next
generation of diverse ADRD scientists, via combined efforts of the Admin, ORE, and REC Cores. In summary,
the NYU ADRD has facilitated pioneering research that defined the stage transitions from normal aging to
dementia, and contributed to AD biomarker development from its inception. In the next five years of funding, this
focus will be expanded by: 1) improving our understanding of disease heterogeneity; 2) identifying new biomarkers
that will allow early detection; and 3) fostering research that will develop effective therapeutic interventions."

This application for renewal of the grant supporting the New Hampshire IDeA Network of Biological
Research Excellence (NH-INBRE) proposes to 1) Improve the biomedical research capacity of the NH-INBRE
Network and moreover the State of NH through collaborative partnership; 2) Increase hands-on, experiential
research opportunities, and professional and research related training for undergraduate (and graduate)
students, postdocs, faculty, and research core staff; 3) Expand our focus on Workforce Development to provide
the necessary robust early entry of trainees to develop the pipeline for the specialized, diverse, research-related
skill sets increasingly needed for biomedical team science; and 4) Leverage NH-INBRE programs in NH and
regionally/nationally by collaboration with both other IDeA grants and non-IDeA funded programs. The
components and organization of the Network are described as is the progress made during the first 9
years.
The proposed Lead institution will continue to be the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, which will
house the NH-INBRE Administrative Core. The University of New Hampshire at Durham will continue to be
the Co-Lead institution. The proposed Partner institutions include 7 four-year primarily undergraduate
institutions and the Community College System of New Hampshire. The themes of the NH-INBRE will be
Microbial Pathogenesis, Cellular and Molecular Biology, Neurobiology and Behavior, and Human Health.
NH-INBRE will continue to be directed by a team of accomplished faculty, all of whom direct active,
federally-funded research laboratories themselves. This team constitutes the Administrative Core (AC) of
NH-INBRE and will be led by Principal Investigator Dr. William R. Green. This team concept, as opposed
to placing the entire administrative functions in the hands of only the Principal Investigator and Program
Coordinator, has proven very effective in establishing NH-INBRE and initiating diverse programs. Different
components of NH-INBRE (Cores and the Developmental Research Projects Program) will work
collaboratively to accomplish the goals of NH-INBRE and to evaluate all NH-INBRE programs. A wide
variety of metrics will continue to be utilized for ongoing evaluation and improvement of the NH-INBRE.
The NH-INBRE plan is organized around the related ideas that original scientific research is a vital part of
scientific training for college students, and expanding the participation of students and faculty at our
Partner institutions in original scientific research on their campuses is essential for instilling a culture of
biomedical research within New Hampshire’s institutions of higher education and the state overall."

The USC/UCLA Center on Biodemography and Population Health (CBPH) represents a unique and highly
successful collaboration between the Davis School of Gerontology of the University of Southern California
(USC) and the Multi-campus Program in Geriatric Medicine and Gerontology in the Geffen School of Medicine
at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), each of which focuses exclusively on research and
teaching on aging. The CBPH has a longstanding role as a leader in efforts to promote theory-based
integration of biological measurement into population-based studies, on-going development and validation of
biological measurement protocols, and theoretically motivated research on the biological mechanisms by which
social, economic, psychological, medical and environmental factors “get under the skin” to influence the
process of health change with age. The CBPH has developed unique clinical and laboratory infrastructure and
pilot projects to improve understanding and use of biodemographic indicators, increase indicators available to
population studies, support more reliable and valid collection of data across a large number of national and
international surveys, and made advances in measurement and validation that allow population surveys to
keep pace with scientific advances in the science of aging. This application proposes a set of activities
designed to (i) expand and enhance theoretical development of the field of biodemography so that we focus on
a new generation of biomarkers reflecting molecular and cellular processes that reflect the basic mechanisms
of aging, (ii) continue efforts to attract new and promising researchers to the field, and (iii) enhance our
Center’s unique role in supporting development, validation, implementation and dissemination of new and
better biodemographic measurement protocols. The specific aims of the CBPH will be to: (1) support and
foster biodemographic research to understand the multiple and interacting factors that affect population health
(with a particular focus on expanding and deepening our understanding of the biological pathways through
which experiences and exposures over the life-course impact trajectories of health and how such influences
may vary across subgroups and settings); (2) further develop an active biodemographic research community
by engaging established and promising junior researchers in a network of scholars who can help advance
biodemographic research; (3) offer funding for pilot projects to support cutting-edge biodemographic research;
(4) support development and dissemination of new research technologies, methodologies and data through our
Research Resource & Dissemination Core and dissemination activities of Administrative Core. Such advances
are needed to support development of models of population health that provide much needed evidence for
policy planners regarding the most effective points of intervention to improve population health and reduce
health disparities. The CBPH has developed the infrastructure, resources and expertise to accomplish its
goals and continue its significant leadership role in advancing biodemographic research on aging.

The South Carolina IDeA Networks of Biomedical Research Excellence (SC INBRE) is a state-wide network
comprised of three Comprehensive Research Universities (CRUs) and ten Primarily Undergraduate Institutions
(PUIs) whose goals are to enhance the biomedical research infrastructure and promote undergraduate
research training in South Carolina while increasing access to research opportunities and careers in
biomedicine for underrepresented minorities and economically disadvantaged students. The scientific themes
in SC INBRE emerge from the research expertise in South Carolina and include Biochemistry and
Cell/Molecular Biology, Bioengineering, Biomedical Engineering, Regenerative Medicine, and Neuroscience.
With the rise of “big data” and a move towards personalized medicine, the need for research and training in
Bioinformatics has increased. To meet this demand, the Bioinformatics Core of SC INBRE provides workshops
and hands-on training opportunities for faculty and students seeking to apply bioinformatics tools to their
research. During the current funding cycle, SC INBRE made significant progress in addressing these goals.
From 2015-2019, 415 students were trained in biomedical research labs in the SC INBRE network. Of these
students, 39% were male, 61% female and overall 29% were underrepresented minorities. For the students
who completed their undergraduate education during this funding period, 44% enrolled in graduate school,
17% went to medical/health professional school, and 39% obtained a job industry. SC INBRE faculty and
students produced over 100 publications and gave over 600 presentations during this funding cycle. Their work
led to over $9 million dollars in extramural funding from a variety of federal and non-federal sources. Fostering
inter-institutional collaborations and promoting a research culture at PUIs, SC INBRE contributed to a
collaborative U54 award which brings $12.5 million in research dollars to South Carolina. During the next
phase of SC INBRE, the network’s reach across the state will be expanded to include several new PUIs, with
long-time network members serving a role models for these new institutions. The Developmental Research
Project and Bioinformatics Pilot Project programs will continue to support faculty-driven research and student
training. SC INBRE will continue to promote undergraduate research training at network PUIs through SC
INRBE-sponsored Undergraduate Research Programs and proposes to expand training capacity at five PUIs
through renovation of existing space/facilities. Career and professional development activities will be provided
to SC INBRE faculty and students, as well as opportunities to network and develop collaborations with SC
INBRE colleagues. Outreach programs developed at selected SC INBRE institutions will engage high school
teachers and students, strengthening the pipeline of future college students interested in biomedical research
careers and actively encouraging participation by underrepresented minority students and those from
underserved areas in South Carolina."

the Wyoming Science and Tier One Engineering Initiatives, two state government supported efforts to enhance
Wyoming STEM infrastructure including two new research buildings, new faculty hires, and new student
programs. The Wyoming INBRE Network will continue to be enhanced by continuing to build partnerships
between faculty at UW and community colleges. The approaches for creating collaborations between research
scientists at UW and faculty at community colleges are essential in moving the thematic research areas forward
by increasing opportunities for faculty and students, and the quality and visibility of the research performed
across the state. Finally, by creating opportunities for undergraduates early in their academic careers, a pool of
students is being created that will contribute to the next generation of health professionals, biomedical scientists,
and employees for the biotechnology industries. A significant enhancement for INBRE-4 is Wyoming INBRE has

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major health threat to the nation and the world causing great human pain and
economic loss. While some advances have been made in detection and raising awareness, finding treatments
has remained unsuccessful in spite of decades of research. To date, efforts have focused on defining the disease
by a narrow characterization of end-stage pathology, using restrictive samples and technologies that
systematically exclude the diversity of the disease. This approach has led to multiple failures, resulting in scant
progress on the therapeutic front. With this backdrop, the Mount Sinai Alzheimer's Disease Research Center
(MSADRC), with its history of success in therapeutic development dedicates itself anew to identify and develop
effective approaches to treating AD. Co-located in Manhattan on the Mount Sinai campus and in the Bronx at the
James J Peters Veterans Administration Medical Center, we bring the strength of two premiere institutions to the
mission of finding a treatment for AD. This application builds on these institutional strengths including systems-
based approaches to scientific inquiry, using the computational tools to mine big data and our established
expertise in recruiting diverse populations. We propose as our theme “Understanding disease heterogeneity to
optimize therapeutic approaches to treat and cure Alzheimer's disease” as it aligns our strengths with the
implementation areas and milestones of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA). We propose 7 cores
(Administrative, Clinical, Biomarker, Genetics, Neuropathology, Data, and Outreach) and a Research Education
Component, all of which have outstanding leadership reflecting newly recruited faculty as well investigators with
established histories at the MSADRC. Using the collaborative efforts of the Clinical and Outreach Core, enhanced
by novel methods of patient engagement through the electronic medical records at both locations, we propose to
expand and maintain a cohort of 450 diverse individuals, 40% of whom will be from under-represented minorities,
all receiving annual clinical evaluations, genetic analysis, and blood biomarker collection. The Genetics Core will
collect genetics data on all, generate GWAS, and will obtain plasma samples for established biomarkers and
proteomics on this diverse cohort. Our new Biomarker Core, supported by new philanthropy and existing research
efforts will obtain structural and functional imaging on all patients, and molecular phenotyping with CSF biomarkers
or molecular imaging on at least 50% of the cohort, capturing its full diversity. The Neuropathology Core,
expanding collection beyond brain to other relevant tissues and body fluids obtained at autopsy, will allow the
preparation of relevant brain regions for unbiased systematic sampling (stereology) and autopsy-derived
specimens for iPS, multiomics, microbiome, and exosome studies. The Data Core, enhanced by the addition of the
Senior Associate Dean for Scientific Computing and Data Science as Core Co-Leader, will expand the capacity to
integrate and share the Core's resources to facilitate interdisciplinary collaborations and create an environment
that fosters innovative approaches to finding treatments and cures."

The National Alzheimer's Project Act establishes an integrated national plan to overcome Alzheimer's disease
(AD); develop treatments to prevent, halt, or reverse the course of AD; improve the early diagnosis of AD; and
decrease disparities in AD for ethnic and racial minority populations at higher risk for AD. In this context, AD is
intended to encompass AD-related dementias, including dementia with Lewy bodies. In support of the goals
and research milestones of the National Alzheimer's Project Act, the mission of the Stanford Alzheimer's
Disease Research Center (ADRC) is to serve as a shared resource to facilitate and enhance research on AD
and the spectrum of cognitive impairment associated with Lewy body (LB) pathology. We follow a strategy of
deep phenotyping, believing that critical answers emerge more readily when investigators are able to delve
deeply within and across multiple levels of participant data. Healthy adults without cognitive or motor
impairment serve both as a comparison (control) population and as a preclinical population in which
mechanisms of cognitive aging and clinical transition can be studied. People with Parkinson's disease without
cognitive impairment also serve as comparators and as an at-risk transitional population for the development of
cognitive impairment linked to LB pathology. ADRC resources will provide investigators with unique
opportunities for the parallel study of these two neurodegenerative disorders, enabling insights into
pathogenesis, preclinical diagnosis, transitions, resistance and resilience, and therapeutic approaches. Aims of
the Stanford ADRC are to (1) provide an administrative structure that advances the mission of the center; (2)
develop and maintain human resources for studies of the AD spectrum and the LB spectrum of cognitive
impairment, as well as cognitive aging; (3) make available well-characterized brain tissues, brain-derived
biospecimens, and quantitative molecular data derived from high-content imaging of brain tissues; (4) make
available participant biospecimens and high-content biospecimen data; (5) provide structural, functional, and
molecular neuroimaging biomarkers in support of research on AD-spectrum cognitive impairment, LB-spectrum
cognitive impairment, and cognitive aging; (6) provide for the management of Stanford ADRC data, prepare
research datasets, provide high-level biostatistical consultation for ADRC investigators, and support research
on big data using tools from biostatistics, bioinformatics, and artificial intelligence; (7) with our community
partners, provide respectful, culturally sensitive outreach and provide opportunities for education, training, and
research participation for healthy adults, people with AD-spectrum and LB-spectrum disorders, and their
families. Stanford ADRC outreach and community engagement extends particularly to urban Hispanic/Latino
older adults, an important Bay Area population, which is under-represented in AD-related research; and (8)
support the training of investigators and future leaders in the field of AD and related dementia."
10839774,"PROJECT SUMMARY: OVERALL YALE ADRC
 The Yale Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) seeks to advance our understanding of
Alzheimer’s disease at a cell biological level with the eventual goal of translating laboratory discoveries into
novel effective clinical therapies. Seven Cores (Administrative, Clinical, Data, Biomarker, Neuropathology,
Imaging and Outreach) and a Research Education Component will work together to achieve this goal. Our
unifying theme is a focus on the cell biology of specific neurons, and its disruption in AD, whether measured by
genome/proteome-wide methods in Biofluids, imaged diagnostically, manifested clinically in behavioral
attributes, detected pathologically in brain tissue at autopsy or observed in cultures of induced pluripotent stem
cells. The participation of the seven Cores will accelerate and optimize the ability of individual Research
Projects both within and beyond the Yale ADRC to ask and answer specific pathophysiological questions and
to translate knowledge to therapies. The breadth of the Core support for particular projects will allow
assessments across the heterogeneity of Alzheimer’s disease.
 The Yale ADRC expects to extend its track record of facilitating Research Projects focused on specific
neuronal organelles and specific neuronal subtypes perturbed in disease while making use of human tissue
analysis and human subject imaging to evaluate mechanistic hypotheses. The Biomarker Core will develop
novel, sensitive and high-throughput mass spectrometry assays and genomic methylation profiles to monitor
disease mechanisms. The Imaging Core will develop, integrate and apply novel PET tracers and functional
MRI connectivity maps to subjects of the Clinical Core and multiple separately supported Research Projects. A
key emphasis will be the translational development of research findings into therapeutic benefit. To support
the future strength of Alzheimer’s research, the Yale ADRC will strive to advance the careers of Young
Investigators through mentorship from a distinguished Internal Advisory Committee, and through Development
Project awards coupled with an extensive educational program developed by the Research Education
Component. In addition to collecting clinical data and biospecimens of brain, CSF, DNA, serum, blood cells
and iPSCs for analysis by members of the Yale ADRC research team, the Yale ADRC will support other NIH-
funded research studies on related topics and contribute materials to national NIA-sponsored research
networks. The Outreach Core will connect with the community to provide greater knowledge regarding
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia."
10877923,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The purpose of the proposed University of Chicago (UChicago) Center for Healthy Aging Behaviors and
Longitudinal InvestigationS (CHABLIS) is to promote a sustained research and infrastructure development
program that leverages longitudinal data, from both observational and interventional studies, to examine how
demographic and economic factors facilitate or suppress individual healthy aging behaviors (HABs) and, in
turn, influence outcomes among older adults over the life course. Spanning five divisions and schools, and
partnering with the National Opinion Research Center (NORC), CHABLIS will bring many areas of expertise
and multiple methodologies to bear on the demography and economics of aging. The central thesis of this
proposal is that CHABLIS connects schools, disciplines (e.g., economics, sociology, medicine), and people.
We aim to: 1) enhance and lead innovation in the demography and economics of aging; and 2) cultivate the
next generation of leaders in social science approaches to aging research with attention to demographic
methods and approaches. The Program Development Core focuses on providing research and career
development support to early-career faculty and supporting pilot projects that span the demography and
economics of aging in both medical and social science realms. Our External Innovative Network Core draws on
the infrastructure of the National Social Life, Health and Aging Project (NSHAP), and our local Comprehensive
Care Physician (CCP) Program, to create opportunities for exchange and research synergies between these
two different forms of data collection and research. The External Research Resources Support and
Dissemination Core is a joint effort with the Duke Center for Population Health and Aging (CPHA). Its goal is to
identify, design, conduct and assess innovations in data collection and measurement for use in current and
future data-focused studies of aging, and share those findings immediately. The emphasis in that Core, and
throughout our proposal, is that longitudinal data collection efforts are central to research on aging, whether
they be local (e.g., CCP) or national (e.g., NSHAP); data collection processes must be continually advanced to
ensure that these data are relevant, and used. Our Administrative and Research Support Core lays out our
move, both physically and administratively, to the Center for Health and the Social Sciences (CHeSS). This
Core will manage all aspects of the enterprise and will conduct expanded evaluation activities. CHABLIS
enjoys the strengths of a productive and influential set of senior scholars who will effectively mentor its twelve
early-career faculty members."
10861014,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - OVERALL
 The Inter-collaborative Radiation Countermeasures (INTERACT) Consortium was assembled for the overall
goal of developing safe and effective medical countermeasures (MCM) to mitigate and/or treat the acute,
delayed, and long-term consequences of radiation exposure for all subsets of the civilian population in the event
of a radiological or nuclear (RadNuc) public health emergency. The biological complexity of multiorgan injury
(MOI) and failure associated with acute radiation sickness (ARS) and delayed effects of acute radiation exposure
(DEARE) requires a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to efficiently identify new targets for therapeutic
intervention and to move promising MCMs from the research laboratory to advanced pharmaceutical
development and approval under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Animal Rule (AR) regulatory
pathway. INTERACT, a newly formed University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM)-based Center for
Medical Countermeasures against Radiation (CMCR), is a partnership of internationally-recognized investigators
from four U.S.-based universities who possess a broad depth of expertise in MCM development, a unique set of
animal model platforms, and a common goal of sharing ideas and quality practices to advance the cutting-edge
scientific discovery and translational development of MCMs.
 INTERACT projects are broadly designed around a common theme to promote tissue regeneration through
targeting the biological processes involved in cellular degeneration that contribute to the clinical manifestation of
ARS/DEARE after prompt exposure to high-doses of total body irradiation (TBI). Candidate MCMs under
investigation target key biological mechanisms associated with a radiation-induced accelerated aging process
including genomic instability, mitochondrial damage, cellular senescence, and inflammation that leads to the
hematopoietic (Project 1) and gastrointestinal subsyndromes of ARS (Projects 2, 3), cutaneous radiation injury
(Project 3), and DEARE (Projects 1 and 4). Preliminary datum for each of the MCMs under investigation in
Projects 1-4 have shown a significant improvement in survival when administered at least 24 hours post-
exposure and strong safety profiles in preclinical, and in some cases clinical trials. To advance MCM
development within the framework of the AR regulatory pathway for all subsets of the population, projects are
supported by two service cores (Core A- Administrative, Core B- Multispecies Efficacy and Pharmacometric
Modeling Core) and two consortium cores (Coordinating Center Core, and the Opportunities Fund
Management Core). Core B offers one of, if not the most, comprehensive animal model platforms available for
MCM testing within the broader CMCR consortia, and includes rabbit, minipig, and non-human primate models
of ARS and/or DEARE.
 INTERACT is synergistic with other potential Centers by offering capabilities and resources currently
unavailable to other sites through data and resource sharing and technology transfer to advance and strengthen
the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)/National Institute of Health (NIH)’s mission to
ensure the nation’s preparedness to respond to a radiological or nuclear incident."
10896946,"Abstract
The UW ADRC's driving scientific focus is investigating the biological heterogeneity of ADRD – the mechanistic
and biological underpinnings of the pathophysiology of disease as well as the factors countering degeneration
and dementia. Our Center was one of the first to recognize etiologic heterogeneity in Alzheimer's disease2 and
this focus is still urgently needed. New technologies and paradigms have emerged to analyze biological
mechanisms of ADRD, and require well characterized human subjects and well-curated biospecimens.
 The proposed organizing framework for our core research resources is multi-disciplinary ADRD
phenotyping. The four key disciplines to integrate are genetic, cognitive, topographic/anatomic, and
neuropathologic. In this framework, the brain space is the point of integration of the other biomarkers of AD, as
the magnitude and location of the different pathologies are the most tangible and objective manifestation of the
outcome of different pathophysiological pathways. Thus a key aspect of our work will include integrating
biomarkers extended over the cerebral cortex, as derived from imaging and neuropathology, with fluid
biomarkers, cognitive and genetic information. An important goal is to support better stratification of AD
phenotypes to advance investigation of candidate AD mechanisms.
 The UW ADRC is uniquely poised to undertake this work, which incorporates the historical strengths of
the Center and research resources of the UW, leverages the collective expertise of the Core Leads and the
Director, and benefits from new technical abilities that enable us to implement this program. New components
are being proposed to bring expertise dedicated to bridging disciplines by innovations in techniques, methods,
and informatics. These include Stem Cell and Precision -omics components in the Precision Neuropathology
Core, Psychometrics component in the Clinical Core, Informatics expertise in the new Imaging and Biomarker
Core and an Open Neuroscience workshop in the Research Education Component.
 Our Center's philosophy is to view ADRD not only through the lens of what is lost, but also through
what is spared, and the associated retained strengths. This perspective permeates our Center, from motivating
our interest in the biological and mechanistic basis of resilience and anatomic sparing, to the outreach efforts
of the ADRC and its associated Memory and Brain Wellness Center.
 Another important theme of our Center is ADRD in American Indians and Alaska Natives. Building on
our successful efforts in the last 5 years, we plan to extend our outreach efforts to Native tribes and
organizations in Washington State, to improve their readiness for ADRD research, and to make a focused
effort to understand and develop models to overcome the barriers to biospecimen collection and data sharing
in this population."

 The Mission of the Vermont Genetics Network (VGN) is to build the biomedical research infrastructure in Vermont.
Our focus is on human health and behavior as broadly defined. The goal is to build and sustain a culture of research
throughout the State of Vermont by facilitating the research capacity of faculty members and the education of
undergraduates at our baccalaureate partner institutions.
 We have created state-of-the-art facilities at the University of Vermont (UVM), the lead institution, to serve the
network; promoted faculty and student research at VGN Baccalaureate Partner Institutions (BPIs) with research awards
and mentoring; and provided BPIs and other colleges with internship experiences and class modules for students to have
hands-on experience with research protocols and use VGN’s facilities. Assessments show that VGN-funded faculty at
BPIs and UVM are publishing and becoming competitive. Our efforts in the first 3 ½ years of INBRE 3 have resulted in
114 publications (BPI faculty = 31; Bioinformatics = 21; Proteomics = 50; Microarray = 12), 67 extramural grants (past
and current BPI faculty funded in INBRE 3 = 21; Bioinformatics = 8; Proteomics = 38) funded to VGN faculty or facilitated
by VGN, and 146 students serving as interns in the STEM fields with 89% of those tracked working in or pursuing
graduate work in a STEM field. Our efforts promote a culture of research and provide the facilities to promote faculty
research and student training.
 Four new specific aims in INBRE 4 build upon successes and bring innovation to VGN: 1. Enhance advising of faculty
to facilitate grants and articles funded/accepted for publications; 2. Build interdisciplinary thematic groups of faculty
scholars to encourage collaboration and enhance the quality of research inquiries; 3. Enhance educational experiences
and continue diversification of undergraduates; and 4. Continue to enhance sharing of research resources through our
Bioinformatics Core, Proteomics Core, Core Marketplace, and collaboration with other INBREs and UVM COBREs. The
Professional Development and Education Core will implement Aims 1, 2, and 3. The Bioinformatics Core will implement
Aim 4 (as well as Aims 1 and 3) by providing critical data analysis support for the VGN facilities; giving assistance to
network faculty for research and incorporation of research into classes; and supporting cyber infrastructure for network
communication and data management. The Proteomics Facility will implement Aim 4 (as well as Aims 1 and 3) by
conducting proteomic analyses (our Facility is the only full service one in Vermont, facilitating publication of findings,
and providing educational opportunities for students. The Administrative Core will provide logistical, financial,
compliance oversight, and external evaluation to ensure that VGN is sensitive to changing needs and evolving strengths
of the network institutions. The Administrative Core arranges mentoring and undergraduate intern programs to
increase the biomedical workforce size and diversity through the PDE Core. Our focus on Human Health and Behavior
allows for greater participation at BPIs than our earlier focus on genetics. VGN has strong support and commitments
from all network institutions and collaborations among regional INBREs and COBREs."
10839377,"With ~560,000 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients and >4 million residents >65 years old, Florida is, and will
continue to be, an epicenter of the AD epidemic in the United States. The 1Florida ADRC is a collaboration
between Florida institutions, including the University of Florida (UF), Mt. Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach
(MSMC), University of Miami (UM), Florida International University (FIU), and Florida Atlantic University (FAU).
The 1Florida ADRC’s global mission is to work with other ADRCs and stakeholders in the AD field to help change
the understanding of AD and related dementias (ADRDs) to a new reality in which ADRDs are more facilely and
accurately diagnosed, more effectively treated, and ultimately preventable or curable. Much of what we know
about the natural history of AD, risk factors for cognitive decline, and response to interventions has come from
study of Caucasian populations, largely of European descent. Multiple studies suggest a higher incidence of
dementia among Hispanics and other underrepresented minority populations (URM), but whether these findings
are broadly generalizable is unclear. Our successful recruitment and evaluation of a majority Hispanic cohort
has enabled us to begin to evaluate whether there are differences in ADRDs between Hispanics and non-
Hispanics in South Florida. Enhancing our understanding of dementia in ethnically and racially diverse
populations is a major theme of our ADRC that will be expanded to include African Americans. As we transition
towards an ADRC potentially funded as a P30, we will leverage our successful institutional and investigator
partnerships to further expand our recruitment and longitudinal follow up of participants with ethnic, linguistic,
cultural, and genetic diversity, as well as comorbidities associated with AD (e.g., vascular disease, Lewy Body
Dementia (LBD)). Our overall specific aims are to: 1) Elucidate novel markers for the earliest prodromal stages
of cognitive impairment and identify predictors of decline in our ethnically and racially diverse participants, who
present with no or varied comorbidities. These longitudinal cohort studies, biomarker studies, and
neuropathological studies will help the field to better understand AD, comorbidities, and disease heterogeneity.
2) Enhance our institutional research environments and provide resources to foster a) unique training
opportunities; b) career development; and c) novel and innovative research in ADRDs with a growing emphasis
on cross-disciplinary team science and advanced data analysis approaches. 3) Provide data, research tools and
biospecimens to, and interact with, a wide variety of stakeholders within and outside (e.g., NACC, NCRAD) of
our collaborating institutional network. 4) Provide educational activities relevant to ADRDs to health
professionals, those in training, and to lay community members, with the goals of improving knowledge,
developing skills, and building stronger coalitions to deliver better diagnoses and care to patients and their
families."

environmental health sciences (EHS) along the continuum from genes to populations by building on NC State’s
unique research strengths and resources in quantitative biology, -omics and analytical technologies, and
diverse model organisms, as well as its emerging strength in human population science. Through the
purposeful interfacing of different disciplines and a systems biology framework integrating all levels of
biological organization - biomolecule, pathway, cell, tissue, organ, model organism, human, and human
population - CHHE will elucidate fundamental mechanisms through which environmental stressors interface
with pathways, the genome, and epigenome to influence human health outcomes. CHHE has made
outstanding progress in the first funding cycle. CHHE has significantly: (1) advanced innovative multi-
disciplinary EHS team research; (2) expanded its NIEHS grant base; (3) increased EHS capacity at its partner
institutions, East Carolina University and North Carolina Central University; (4) cultivated the next generation of
EHS leaders; and (5) developed multi-directional engagement with communities affected by exposure to toxic
metals and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. During our first funding cycle, four Research Interest Groups
(RIGs) evolved organically and the Emerging Contaminants, Environmental Epigenetics and Genetics,
Pulmonary Health, and Behavior and Neuroscience RIGs now represent CHHE thematic areas. In the coming
cycle, we have enhanced our three facility cores to increase the impact and the basic science and translational
capacity of our membership. The Systems Technologies Core provides cutting-edge technologies involving
genomics, metabolomics, metallomics, and proteomics. The Comparative Pathology Core provides pathologic
phenotypic assessment of the many model organisms used by members and imaging support with links back
to omics technologies. The Integrative Health Science Facility Core facilitates bidirectional translation between
basic science and public health outcomes by providing data science analysis and visualization support for
analysis of human population and multi-omic studies as well as population-based study expertise. As a land-
grant university, NC State has a dedicated community engagement philosophy that augments CHHE’s
Community Engagement Core and fosters relationships between CHHE and affected communities in NC which
leads to collaborative interaction among researchers, educators, and citizens to enhance EHS knowledge,
literacy, and health. A strong Career Development Program for early- and mid-career investigators is
coordinated with a robust Pilot Project Program that supports collaborative and multidisciplinary EHS projects
to enhance the research success of our members. Our CHHE mission is to continue to evolve as a premier
NIEHS EHS Core Center and serve as the nexus of EHS research at NC State by providing focus, resources,

This is an application from the Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics and the Renal, Electrolyte and
Hypertension Division, the Department of Neurology, and the Department of Psychiatry at the University of
Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine to serve as the Scientific and Data Research Center (SDRC) for
the Hemodialysis Opioid Prescription Effort (HOPE) Consortium. Through this HEAL / NIDDK initiative, the
HOPE Consortium will collaboratively design and conduct a multicenter clinical trial evaluating interventions to
address the challenging problems of chronic pain and opioid use in individuals receiving treatment with
maintenance hemodialysis. We anticipate that the HOPE Consortium investigators will consider behavioral,
complementary, and pharmacologic interventions, personalized treatments based on psychosocial profiles,
adaptive designs to maximize efficiency, and approaches to the delivery of the interventions and acquisition of
data that minimize burden for patients by “bringing the trial to the participant”. Specifically, the SDRC will:
1) provide scientific leadership for the design, implementation, and analysis of the HOPE Consortium clinical
trial; 2) provide comprehensive operational support to the Clinical Centers for implementing the collaboratively
designed trial protocol using standardized processes and tools for training, recruitment, and data management;
3) develop and lead a Stakeholder Engagement Working Group that includes a Patient Advisory Panel and a
Dialysis Provider Advisory Panel to ensure that perspectives across multiple stakeholders are incorporated into
the trial design and implementation approach; 4) integrate and analyze data from the electronic health records
of the participating Clinical Centers to supplement trial-acquired data and enable identification of predictors of
response to the trial interventions; 5) establish, promote, and maintain consortium-wide high standards for
quality assurance and practices; 6) initiate and oversee contracts with industry partners including dialysis
provider organizations, pharmaceutical companies, and device manufacturers; 7) prepare reports for the Data
and Safety Monitoring Board, and support the preparation of Consortium reports of scientific findings;
8) prepare, document, and transfer Consortium data and biosamples to the NIDDK Central Repository for use
by the broader community; and 9) develop approaches for disseminating the trial findings to diverse
stakeholders to facilitate post-trial uptake of interventions found to be beneficial. The University of
Pennsylvania SDRC team has the expertise, experience, established working relationships, resources, and
infrastructure to accomplish each of these aims and fulfill all of the requirements specified in the RFA."

Project Summary
The mission of the Nebraska IDeA Networks of Biomedical Research Excellence (NE-INBRE) is to stimulate and
develop biomedical research capacity at institutions of higher education in Nebraska. The NE-INBRE is
structured around two major components: primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) and PhD granting research
institutions (RIs). Support for each PUI consists of: 1) campus research capacity development through support
for faculty research and infrastructure enhancement, and 2) development of the undergraduate research pipeline
of students through the NE-INBRE Scholars Program. Expanding research capacity at the RIs includes providing
significant support to multi-user core facilities in order to allow investigators from PUIs and RIs access to cutting-
edge technology. The nine participating PUIs in the NE-INBRE research network include two publically supported
State Colleges, three campuses of the University of Nebraska system, and four private institutions. The three
participating RIs in the research network include two campuses of the University of Nebraska system and one
privately supported medical center. Cutting-edge multiuser core facilities include cores in genomics,
bioinformatics, and advanced microscopy. The three themes reflect the scientific foci of the NE-INBRE, infectious
diseases, cancer biology, and cell signalling. These themes serve to link faculty and students at the separate
institutions into productive networks based on their areas of expertise and interest. Throughout the tenure of the
NE-INBRE, its primary objective at the undergraduate level has been to provide and expand research
opportunities for students and create a pipeline of students to enter into biomedical research and other health
professions. NE-INBRE investments in faculty research projects and infrastructure at the PUIs have created
opportunities for both NE-INBRE Scholars and other undergraduate students to become involved in advanced
biomedical research."
11136202,"The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) provides clinical trial sites to the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials Group (IMPAACT). The IMPAACT network and its leadership group oversee the creation of all their studies, protocols, and clinical trials. These activities are funded through Grants/Cooperative agreements sponsored by NIAID. The IMPAACT Network is a cooperative group of institutions, investigators, and other collaborators mainly focused on evaluating potential therapies for HIV infection and its related symptoms and co-infections in infants, children, adolescents and pregnant women. This includes clinical trials of HIV/AIDS interventions for the prevention of mother to child transmission.

The IMPAACT Network goal is to conduct high quality clinical trials and/or protocols that will advance the prevention and treatment of HIV and its complications for infants, children, adolescents, and pregnant/ postpartum women globally. The IMPAACT research agenda in this task order includes four scientific specific aims, which reflect the key areas of work. Those areas are HIV Treatment, HIV Prevention, HIV Cure, and HIV Complications. For each area, a Scientific Committee composed of experts in the specific field, site investigators, community representatives, and representatives of the central network resources, continually reassesses the research priorities in light of emerging science as well as new ideas and opportunities; it seeks collaboration with other trials networks and research entities; oversees the formulation and review of study concept plans based on the scientific priorities; and monitors the development and implementation of approved network studies in the specific research area.

In 1990 the NICHD began collaborating with the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) to  expand clinical trial availability at NICHD clinical trial centers/sites. This collaboration made possible to conduct clinical trials by the IMPAACT Network to further evaluate antiretroviral therapeutic  agents,  other therapies targeted at opportunistic infections, and interventions to prevent perinatal  HIV transmission. In recent years, the collaboration is expanding to evaluate potential HIV  cure approaches  and vaccines.

The purpose of this task order is to recruit, follow and complete the IMPAACT Related protocols listed below. The integration of the results of these 8 protocols, which will be presented in a final report, will provide data to advance the prevention, treatment and remission of HIV, its most common complications and related infectious diseases in maternal, adolescent and pediatric populations.

For the last 35 years NICHD/NIAID as part of the scientific community have been conducting intense HIV research. During this time, it became clear that to be successful in the attempt to curve the HIV infection rates of the epidemic, and appropriately treat the individual infectious process, an integrated and comprehensive approach to HIV research is required. Furthermore, NICHD/NIAID and others in the scientific community found in the mid-90s that one or even two different anti-retroviral drugs (ARVs) are not sufficient to appropriately treat an individual HIV infection. Therefore, the synergy of three or more drugs (ARVs) is required to effectively treat and keep at bay an individual HIV infection. For that reason, the development and testing of multiple ARVs in different trials is essential. This requires the development and testing of multiple ARVs in different trials. At the same time, as soon as a drug was developed and approved, multiple other trials were needed to discern the potential synergy between them.

It is now known to the scientific community, that the initial attempts to achieve an HIV Cure (remission) might require the interaction of multiple ARVs, in addition to an early start in the treatment after infection (clinical protocols in this task order) plus the potential use of passive immunotherapy plus long term acting antiretroviral therapy (under study in a task order protocol) and possibly even therapeutic vaccines.
 
Therefore, it is evident that although all individual trials (protocols) can provide very useful information, the integration of this acquired knowledge from some of the different protocols will provide a more comprehensive data analysis that will lead to a better scientific assessment to determine the best approach for prevention and treatment of HIV and its complications and comorbidities in the maternal, adolescent and pediatric populations.

While the individual protocols are important, completion of the 8 protocols in this task order and receipt of the final report, which includes the integrated data from all these protocols, is necessary because if not NICHD and the IMPAACT Network may lose part of the comprehensive nature of these studies. It is also evident that combined results could eventually help in the process of achieving a better and sustained HIV remission, and a more effective prevention and treatment for HIV and other related infectious diseases in pediatric, adolescent, and maternal patient populations."

HEADS Center will accomplish its Aims through an infrastructure of four Cores. Core A, the Administrative
and Research Support Core will develop and execute the Center’s strategic vision by coordinating and
managing research, methods, data, community-building, and dissemination resources across Cores. Core B,
the Program Development Core will provide funding, interdisciplinary research mentorship, and regulatory
monitoring for novel pilot studies that can advance research within our themes, develop the careers of
researchers addressing these themes, and attract investigators to the field. Core D, the External Research
Resources Support and Dissemination Core, will build the community of scientists engaged in research
related to HEADS themes, facilitate rigorous use of research resources, disseminate scientific evidence
developed within our themes, and nurture partnerships with key stakeholders and advocacy organizations to
translate findings into policy and practice. Core E, the Remote Data Enclave Core will create and sustain a
high-capacity, secure computing environment, that can generate new investigations and investigators
pursuing projects within our themes that leverage unique linkages between ADRD related data, many with
strict security requirements. The HEADS Center will leverage unique strengths at Johns Hopkins University
(Hopkins) to build a cross-school, interdisciplinary, and diverse environment for developing and executing
innovative research to advance population-based science that addresses ADRD care and its economic
consequences."
10910004,"Summary
Concerns about global nuclear war, less likely than in the past, have been replaced by the real potential of a
terrorist strike using radiological weapons. The threat of such attacks has grown in recent years, with the
increased activity of global terrorist organizations and a rise in illicit trafficking of radioactive materials.
Unfortunately, very few medical products exist to counter the variety of acute and long-term toxicities that can
result from nuclear or radiological attacks. There remains a great need to expand the medical options available
to prevent or treat radiation-induced injury. We have formed a consortium termed Radiation Countermeasures
Centers of Research Excellence (RadCCORE) to collectively and collaboratively increase possible agents to
detect, mitigate and treat those people exposed to deterministic doses of radiation (www.radccore.org/).
Leading scientists in the area of radiation biology, health physics, stem cell biology/transplantation and
immunology have come together to form one of the most comprehensive, inclusive, inter-institutional, and
interdisciplinary Center for Medical Countermeasures Against Radiation (CMCR). RadCCORE is a network of
academic medical centers: Duke University, University of North Carolina, and Wake Forest University and will
consist of four research projects and four support cores. A major benefit of this group of investigators has
been the dedication and strength of the individuals in the areas of normal tissue injury, radiation biology,
physics, training and education. Given that most of our lead compounds have progressed through the
development pipeline and are now externally funded, we have selected a new set of promising
countermeasures. This arrangement brings novel investigators, increased basic and translational science
knowledge and novel mitigators to our center. This network addresses broad areas of research and has made
great strides in the development of new therapeutic products to prevent short- and long-term toxicities."

This is a proposal for continuing support of the Center for Demography of Health and Aging (CDHA) at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison. The overall goal of CDHA is to sustain and improve a major research and
training program in the demography of health and aging. The institutional architecture of CDHA is
designed to create links between social demography, economics, biomedical and epidemiological research
on health and aging. Major themes of ongoing and developmental research activities within CDHA include
1) Aging and the Life Course; (2) Biodemography, including data collection and analytical work with
biomarkers, gene-environment interactions and the microbiome; (3) Determinants of sociodemographic
disparities of aging trajectories; (4) Assessing the organization, technology, policy, and delivery of care; and
(5) Place-based impacts on health and aging. CDHA is an autonomous research unit within the College of
Letters and Science where it coexists with the Center for Demography and Ecology. It thus shares and
extends a well-developed research infrastructure in administration, computing facilities and data library,
and dissemination capacity. CDHA’s Administrative Core (A) provides leadership and administrative
support for the Center as a whole, particularly for activities of Core B. The Program Development Core (B)
supports faculty, staff, and research assistants engaged in innovative, high-risk pilot research projects that
are likely to lead to major NIA support. The External Innovative Network Core (C) will continue a highly
successful and popular, networked current awareness service for research in the demography of health and
aging and support regular workshops, conferences, and visits. The External Research Resources Core (D)
supports the analysis of large-scale public and restricted-use data resources in the demography of health
and aging and disseminates important research findings. The Remote Data Enclave (E) supports the
analysis of sensitive data under secure conditions and integrates with a state-of-the art Federal Statistical
Research Data Center facility on the UW-Madison campus."
10891553,"This Program represents a cohesive approach motivated by the practical needs of very high-throughput
biodosimetry in a variety of different large-scale exposure scenarios, to predict both individual dose and also
individual sensitivity to future injury. A central characteristic remains our focus on 3 different high-throughput
approaches: fully automated cytogenetics (Project 1), gene expression (Project 2), and metabolomics (Project
3). These have different balances of capabilities in terms of throughput, time-to-result, dose reconstruction,
exposure scenario identification and individual radiosensitivity prediction, and the final goal is to quantify their
optimal integrated usage in different large-scale exposure scenarios. The Projects share four common themes:
1: “Beyond Simple Exposures”: Towards High-Throughput Biodosimetry for Complex Exposures: After
an IND there will be a wide variety of exposure scenarios including very high dose rate, neutron exposure,
partial-body exposure (all from the initial prompt radiation), and varying dose rate and low dose rate (from
external fallout and internal exposure). The goals are to 1) understand how these different exposure scenarios
modulate the response of the predictive biomarkers that we have developed, and 2) optimally use these
biomarkers to identify / characterize these different exposure scenarios to which individuals may be exposed.
2: “Beyond Dose”: Towards High-Throughput Individualized Predictors of Photon and Neutron-
Induced Radiosensitivity and Late Radiation Injury: Gene expression and metabolomics each have utility
for predicting individualized onset of late radiation-induced lung disease, and for predicting which irradiated
animals will die from the disease. This work will be extended to neutron-induced late effects, whilst also
assessing the significance of senescent cells for late disease development and for our lung disease signatures.
3: “Beyond Model Systems”: Probing the Applications of Experimentally-Generated Photon and
Neutron Biomarkers to In-Vivo Human Exposure Scenarios: The goal is to assess in-vivo human
exposures, but biodosimetric assay development is typically performed either with ex-vivo irradiated human
blood or in-vivo in animals. For both photons and neutrons, ex-vivo vs. in-vivo generated biomarkers will be
compared, and ex-vivo generated biomarkers from different species will be characterized and compared.
4: Optimized Biomarker Integration: The three different biomarker systems reflect different balances of
capabilities in terms of, for example, throughput, time-to-result, signal lifetime, dose reconstruction, exposure
scenario identification and individual radiosensitivity prediction. The goal here is to identify their optimal
integrated usage in each of a variety of very different possible large-scale exposure scenarios.
 Three scientific cores (Animal, Irradiation & Dosimetry, and Biostatistics) bring together key support
technologies, with each Core supporting each of the Research Projects. Because of the integrated nature of
the research, this results in major gains in efficiency."

research to reduce the burden of digestive diseases. The Center achieves this mission through the following:
1) Core facilities that provide new technologies, expertise, training, technical assistance, laboratory animals,
biostatistical and clinical research support. 2) A pilot/feasibility program that provides startup funds to
promising investigators. 3) A scientific enrichment program consisting of seminars, special lectures, workshops
and competitions for trainees that improve the intellectual climate for gastrointestinal biological research. 4) A
professional development and training program that fosters the careers of junior faculty and trainees. Members
of the CGIBD are basic and clinical scientists from diverse disciplines dedicated to advancing our
understanding of the biology, physiology and epidemiology of digestive diseases. The overarching theme for
the Center is Homeostasis, Injury and Repair, a theme that encompasses the wide range of digestive disease
research conducted by the membership. Within the theme, members cluster into three areas of research focus:
microbiome, clinical/translational research, regenerative medicine/repair. The research base includes 47 full
members and 9 associate members from 22 departments. The annual direct costs for digestive disease-related
grants to members total $27.9 million. To support the research of members, the Center proposes an
Administrative Core to organize the activities of the Center and the following scientific cores: 1) Advanced

opportunities. The cores improve efficiency, lower cost, and provide services that would not otherwise be
available to investigators. Through all of its activities, the Center improves communication, promotes
collaboration, develops careers, and generally enriches the environment for digestive disease research."
10827948,"ABSTRACT – Overall
Nearly 600,000 new HIV infections occur yearly in adolescents/young adults (ages 15-24 years), the only
population in which HIV infections continue to rise. The end of the HIV/AIDS epidemic will be achievable only
when an effective vaccine regimen can elicit long-term protective immunity in preadolescence, prior to sexual
debut. Yet, even the most promising HIV envelope (Env) vaccine platforms have failed to induce highly-
protective immunity in adults in preclinical and clinical studies. Interestingly, recent studies indicate that
durable, polyfunctional, and broad neutralizing antibody (bnAb) responses following HIV infection occur more
frequently and are equal or more potent in infants compared to that of adults. Yet, there remains a gap in our
understanding of the immunologic mechanisms associated with the rapid induction of HIV bnAb and effector
antibody functions within the infant immune landscape.
The overall goal of this HIVRAD renewal is to harness the unique qualities of the early life immune system for
vaccine elicitation of protective HIV immunity. This work builds on our current HIVRAD Program focusing on
the development of HIV Env vaccine regimens for prevention of infant HIV acquisition. We defined the optimal
vaccine intervals, adjuvants, and doses to achieve maximal immunogenicity in the infant immune system, and
determined that concurrent passive bnAb-active HIV Env immunization does not impair vaccine-elicited
immune responses. In this renewal HIVRAD Program, we hypothesize that HIV Env vaccine platforms
administered in early life and boosted in preadolescence will achieve more durable, broad, and polyfunctional
immune responses and be more efficacious at prevention of sexual transmission than initiation of immunization
in preadolescence. We will compare vaccine responses to two of the most promising HIV Env vaccine
candidates, bnAb germline-targeting SOSIP trimers (Project 1) and lipid nanoparticle mRNA vaccines (Project
2) initiated in infancy with boosting throughout childhood to that of initiation of vaccination in preadolescence in
the rhesus model (Nonhuman Primate (NHP) Core), and test their efficacy against intrarectal homologous
and heterologous SHIV challenge in adolescence. We will apply systems immunology to define the
immunologic, transcriptomic, and microbiologic signatures associated with the HIV Env vaccine antibody
function and induction of bnAb precursors (Integrated Systems Immunology Core (ISIC)). The
Administrative Core provides the full range of support for scientific, fiscal, and other programmatic
management and oversight. By leveraging the extended window for maturation of vaccine-induced responses
and defining the mechanistic advantages of early life immunization for effective anti-HIV responses, this
Program will inform the target population and design of an HIV Env vaccine that will provide life-long
protection."

Project Summary
We are proposing to establish a national resource at UCLA for the development, training and dissemination of
advanced electron diffraction technologies. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) methods promise new life to
high-throughput macromolecular structure determination. CryoEM overcomes the fundamental barrier to X-ray
diffraction determination of macromolecular complexes: growing X-ray grade crystals. Fortunately, the
emergence of microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) facilitates the determination of new protein structures
at atomic resolution from vanishingly small crystals. MicroED exploits the strong interaction between electrons
and nano-scale three-dimensional crystals and takes advantage of emerging cryoEM instrumentation coupled
to established crystallographic methods. We pioneered MicroED to achieve milestone discoveries, namely we
determined previously unknown protein structures at atomic resolution from crystals smaller than the wavelength
of visible light. These technological advances, coupled with the greater availability of advanced cryoEM
instruments, present an opportunity for further improvement of high-throughput structure determination. The
development of new and more efficient approaches to structure determination by MicroED opens new avenues
for comprehensive exploration of complex macromolecular structures that remain out of reach for standard
methods. These systems include macromolecular complexes that grow small, fragile, or imperfect crystals. Our
proposed innovations to technology development in MicroED are in four categories: (1) improved sample
screening and preparation, (2) novel refinement and phasing methods, (2) demonstrating the applicability of
MicroED to natural products and small molecules, and (4) engineering new hardware for investigating structure
dynamics in real time. The biomedical problems associated with these types of assemblies are broad and impact
biomedicine, both through the basic understanding of disease and through enabling new therapeutic platforms.
Our group of key personnel brings together expertise from all modalities of cryoEM, crystallography,
biochemistry, molecular biology, and computation to help develop the next generation of MicroED tools. This
effort will be informed by projects led by expert groups around the country working on projects that pose
significant structural challenges. Together, we propose a resource that can make nanocrystallography and
MicroED routine methodologies for non-experts. Extensive user training and community engagement will further
disseminate the MicroED technology and bring new structures to light."

The studies proposed in this U19 application titled “The Influence of Dietary Botanical Supplements on
Biological and Behavioral Resilience” represent a cohesive program of integrated and interdisciplinary
research approaches that comprehensively address the objectives and purpose of RFA-OD-19-001. In
particular, the principal objective of this botanical dietary supplement research center (BDSRC) is to provide
valuable insight, through both pre-clinical and clinical lines of investigation that may inform a future clinical trial
designed to determine if dietary polyphenol supplements can provide resilience against stress-induced
psychological impairment. We have shown through rigorous feasibility studies utilizing stress-induced models
of depression that supplementation with BDPP promotes resilience to depression-like behaviors. We have
identified biomolecular systems associated with immune function and neuronal activity that specific
bioavailable metabolites of BDPP influence to promote resilience to stress. We note that bioavailable
metabolites suppressed production of peripheral leukocytes derived inflammatory cytokines, in particular IL-6,
which is important to consider given studies that find production of IL-6 is a critical response that confers
susceptibility to stress. Whether or not metabolites of BDPP suppress the downstream pathophysiological
effects of stress-induced IL-6 that directly affect neuron function and behavior has yet to be established.
Therefore, Project 1 of this BDSRC will characterize if our botanical supplement provides resilience against
physiological pathways elicited by stress that are associated with increased IL-6 activity and that confer
susceptibility to the onset of depressive-like behavior. Project 1 will also identify biological targets in microglia,
interneurons, and blood brain barrier cells influenced by BDPP metabolites by state-of-the-art cell-specific
RNA-sequencing and imaging techniques. Project 2 will directly synergize with Project 1 by first providing an
assessment of the clinical properties of BDPP, and whether they parallel those observed in rodents. We will
conduct a pharmacokinetic and steady-state profile to define bioavailable metabolites found in human plasma,
and to confirm the presence of metabolites that exert biological effects against IL-6 production. Project 2 will
also utilize a multivariate adaptive regression splines model to identify specific metabolites or combinations of
BDPP metabolites responsible for modulating IL-6 expression. In addition, Project 2 will validate plasma IL-6
as a marker of biological resilience in response to BDPP treatment by testing if BDPP promotes resilience
against upregulation of plasma IL-6 in response to the Trier Social Stress Test in humans. The proposed
Projects are designed and optimized to synergize with each other, and to integrate seamlessly with the two
Scientific Cores. Together, this proposal offers to provide critical information of the mechanism of action and the
clinical properties of BDPP and its metabolites that ﬁll the most critical gaps in the existing body of data needed
to optimally design a future clinical trial to test resilient properties of BDPP in response to stress."

promising treatments emerging from animal studies fail to demonstrate efficacy in human trials.
There are many reasons for these phenomena and one of the key steps to improve this

of taking on scientific tasks and getting projects done with excellent performance. Our strengths
in doing “team science” are perhaps what stands out the most in this proposal. We will establish

10810662,"PROJECT SUMMARY: OVERALL
To respond adaptively to the environment, the brain must process information to develop accurate and stable
representations of the current state of the environment (“state representation”). This requires precise neural
activity timing synchrony between prefrontal and sensory systems and within prefrontal networks.
Our Center focuses on the unifying hypothesis that processes underlying state representation dysfunction are
relevant to psychosis, providing a window into pathophysiologic heterogeneity and precision treatment. Four
Projects span three species (nonhuman primates, mice, and humans) and eight methodologies (genetic
manipulations, slice physiology, ensemble recordings, LFP, behavior, EEG, fMRI, cognitive training). We use a
central computational perspective to translate and integrate across species and methodologies: Changes in
neural information processing affect parameters underlying attractor dynamics and influence state
representation processes. Such changes create observable effects in behavior and neurophysiology, which we
can study through the lens of attractor network models to inform our understanding of pathophysiologic
heterogeneity, clinical trajectories, and precision treatment.
Each Project: 1) Uses the same behavioral tasks to probe components of state representation across species
and experiments; 2) Accesses parallel neurophysiologic metrics, with a focus on neural system activity timing,
excitatory-inhibitory balance, and noise; 3) Uses advanced data-driven causal discovery analyses to facilitate
cross-paradigm integration and novel hypothesis generation. The Projects are supported by a Translational
Neurophysiology Core, a Computational Core, and an Administrative Core.
Aim 1 investigates behavior and neurophysiology of state representation dysfunctions characteristic of
psychosis in a nonhuman primate model of prefrontal network failure in psychosis mediated through NMDA-R
signaling (PROJECT 1); in mice with cell type-specific ablation of NMDA-R function and carrying psychosis-
associated genetic variants (PROJECT 2); and from an EEG-fMRI study of healthy controls and people with
early psychosis (PROJECT 3). Aim 2 develops attractor network models of state representation at multiple
levels of detail, incorporating behavioral, synaptic, and cellular microcircuit data from animal neurophysiology
studies (PROJECTS 1 & 2) to identify parameters that account for state representation dysfunctions
characteristic of psychosis and the behavioral and neurophysiological observations made in humans
(PROJECTS 3 & 4). Aims 3 and 4 focus on reliability and predictive significance of state representation
dysfunctions in early psychosis, and precision treatment approaches targeting specific dysfunctions."
10875566,"PROJECT SUMMARY_OVERALL
 Aging- related challenges, including alterations in mood, sleep disturbances and cognitive decline, have
detrimental effects on quality of life for the elderly. Many botanical agents are purported to improve resilience
to these changes, yet few have been evaluated in well-designed clinical trials. An ideal clinical trial would use
a product optimized for its active constituents, and investigate the botanical for appropriate measures of
efficacy in a relevant target population. Sound preclinical research is therefore needed to identify the functional
effects of a botanical, mechanisms underlying these effects, and the phytochemical constituents modulating
these processes. Studies should also identify interactions between different constituents of botanical, in vivo
biomarkers of target engagement by the botanical, distribution of the compounds in the body, and variability of
response in different populations e.g. age or gender groups. The proposed Botanical Dietary Supplement
Research Center (BDSRC) will establish a pipeline of experimental approaches and techniques required to
deliver answers to these critical issues, with a focus on “Botanicals enhancing neurological and functional
resilience in aging”. This research platform will be used to consolidate and expand our extensive preliminary
studies on Centella asiatica (CA; “gotu kola”), in preparation for a clinical trial in aging participants. A second
botanical, Withania somnifera (WS; “ashwagandha”), with compelling reports of similar biological effects to CA
will be examined in earlier stages of the research pipeline. The specific aims of the Center are to (1) to ensure
a reliable supply of CA and WS and develop methods for targeted and untargeted analysis of their
constituents in plant extracts, plasma and brain tissue; (2) to investigate the in vivo effects of CA and currently
known active compounds on cognition, sleep disturbance and mood in mice, and identify in vivo biomarkers
relating to these effects; (3) to explore mechanisms and active compounds of CA and WS extracts through
targeted and untargeted approaches including biochemometric correlations of composition with biological
activity, and metabolomics or transcriptomics of treated target tissues. These goals will be achieved by the
synergistic interaction of a Botanical Core, Research Project 1 examining in vivo effects of CA on cognition,
sleep deprivation and mood and Research Project 2 exploring mechanisms and active compounds of CA and
WS using mouse primary neurons in vitro, mouse brain slices ex vivo and Drosophila melanogaster in vivo. An
Administrative Core will co-ordinate, guide and disseminate the research activities of the BDSRC, and provide
data management and statistical support. It will also coordinate aim (4) which is to provide research training
and career development opportunities to graduate students and postdoctoral scientists. The BDSRC’s pipeline
will, in future, include clinical trials performed at the NIH/Layton Aging and Alzheimer’s Center at OHSU."
10831434,"Koch PPG – Overall Program
SUMMARY
Heart Failure (HF), a syndrome that results from cardiac injury/stress, is a major world-wide health burden and
improvements in therapy are needed, which allow for novel and innovative research opportunities. This new
Program Project Grant (PPG) proposes novel concepts with specific inter-related basic research areas of cardiac
injury and repair that can truly provide translational impact. The investigators of this PPG have a mutual interest
in HF and post-cardiac injury research and are focused on identifying signaling pathways and molecular
mechanisms of HF and this includes development of novel mouse models to test various hypotheses. We are
also interested in how the failing heart can communicate to distant organs, such as the kidney, where cardiorenal
syndrome is a critical, yet understudied, clinical issue. We all are committed through our distinct, but
complementary and synergistic, research directions to uncover pathways involved in cardiac
injury/stress that can be targeted therapeutically. This represents the overall theme of our PPG application
and the overarching hypothesis is that novel therapeutic strategies can be identified based on the molecular
mechanisms we uncover in our individual projects. This supports the innovation of our P01, as improved
therapies are desperately needed for HF, cardiorenal syndrome and post-ischemic myocardial injury, since these
conditions continue to rise and lack effective therapies to reverse disease. Importantly, this PPG will address
sex differences in our models of cardiac injury and repair, which is a priority within the cardiovascular community.
Overall, we have designed this PPG to include inter-related but independent projects that will be strengthened
by existing collaborations, assets and synergy. Project 1 (Koch) examines the role of G protein-coupled receptor
kinase 5 (GRK5) in the pathophysiology of the heart with a focus on the non-canonical actions of this kinase in
the nucleus of myocytes. Project 2 (Kishore) will examine how gender influences the functionality of stem cell
properties for ischemic myocardial repair, particularly epigenetic basis of gender differences in stem cell function.
Project 3 (Tilley) is focused on leukocyte-mediated regulation of renal fibrosis, dysfunction and progression of
cardiorenal syndrome during the development of HF. Project 4 (Elrod) focuses on mitochondrial calcium
regulation in heart failure and how components of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter are involved. Studies in
these Projects range from cellular to whole heart to inter-organ regulation in order to test our guiding hypothesis
and theme. All four Projects will be supported by one administrative and two scientific Cores that offer murine
surgical and physiological support (Core B-Gao) and myocyte and viral vector support (Core C- Rajan). A PPG
is an appropriate mechanism for these collaborative studies to uncover novel data concerning cardiac injury and
repair and working together will significantly accelerate discovery and interaction to foster scientific inquiries
beyond those outlined here."

 The University of Mississippi (UM) Botanical Dietary Supplements Research Center (BDSRC) is focused
on filling in knowledge gaps related to the potential for the Spirulina-based product, ImmulinaTM, to promote
resilience against and/or recovery from influenza and, by extension, other respiratory viral infections.
ImmulinaTM is a patented bioassay-standardized extract that concentrates the active immunostimulatory
compounds in Spirulina, i.e., Braun-type lipoproteins. Researchers affiliated with the UM BDSRC have
generated evidence that supports reproducible and mechanistically plausible effects of ImmulinaTM for
enhancing host responses that may promote resilience against respiratory viral infections such as influenza.
Last year in the U.S. alone, influenza resulted in 959,000 patient hospitalizations and 79,400 deaths.
 Under the direction of Ikhlas Khan, PhD and Nirmal Pugh, PhD, the UM BDSRC includes a well-
established collaborative team of multi-disciplinary investigators with expertise in natural products, animal
models of human diseases, pharmaceutics, immunology, and human subject research. The UM BDSRC will be
composed of an Administration Core, a Botanical Core, and two research projects: (1) Unraveling Immune
Enhancement by ImmulinaTM, and (2) Evaluation of ImmulinaTM Oral Supplement for Host Resistance to
Influenza Virus Infection.
 The overall specific aims are to: (1) maximize coordination of effort, communication among researchers,
training opportunities for career development, and dissemination of knowledge through a well-managed and
effective Administrative Core; (2) ensure product integrity of the ImmulinaTM extract through a combination of
bioassay- and chemical-based approaches for standardization within the Botanical Core; (3) determine the
molecular mechanism of immune enhancement of ImmulinaTM and optimal formulation and dosing in Project
1’s mouse study that can be utilized by the UM BDSRC’s other studies; and (4) using both a mouse and
subsequently a biomarker-based human model, establish the impact of ImmulinaTM supplementation on
increasing host resilience against the pathogenic effects of influenza virus infection with Project 2.
 The Administrative Core, guided by an External Advisory Committee and an Internal Steering Committee,
will oversee all aspects of the UM BDSRC, including progress towards meeting its milestones, efficient
allocation of resources, collaborations with researchers outside the UM BDSRC, oversight of its graduate
students and post-doctoral fellows, and maintenance of its website. Members of the Botanical Core will work
closely with researchers from the UM BDSRC to provide sufficient quantities of standardized ImmulinaTM
extract and to collaborate with other units of CARBON on future efficacy studies of ImmulinaTM. The results
from Projects 1 and 2 will help establish the optimal regimen for future clinical efficacy trials."

Alcohol misuse impacts the depth and breadth of the HIV epidemic, both domestically and globally, through
multiple pathways—increasing sexual risk behaviors, reducing adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and
increasing the risk for HIV-associated comorbidities and mortality. To reduce the incidence of HIV, approaches
must be developed that concurrently address alcohol misuse in the context of HIV testing and behavioral and
biomedical prevention approaches. Likewise, to increase rates of HIV viral suppression and reduce HIV-related
comorbidities, alcohol misuse must be addressed effectively in diverse populations across a spectrum of HIV
care settings. The Brown University Alcohol Research Center on HIV (ARCH) has been supporting
collaborative research to develop scalable alcohol-HIV interventions, including video counseling, telehealth,
and web-enabled applications, that can be delivered broadly and efficiently using centralized personnel and
technological resources. This application to renew the Brown ARCH is organized around the central theme that
in order to achieve population impact, interventions addressing alcohol misuse in HIV prevention and care
need to be evaluated with an emphasis on real-world effectiveness, scalability, and sustainability, according to
the principles of implementation science. Specifically, we propose three projects that leverage our unique
strengths in (a) training professionals in alcohol misuse interventions, (b) utilizing video counseling and
telehealth as scalable means of reaching populations and providing continuing care, and (c) utilizing behavioral
intervention technologies to provide alcohol interventions and ongoing support for change. Research
Component 1 (MPI: Wray and Monti) extends our work on the role of alcohol use in HIV transmission among
men who have sex with men (MSM) by testing the effectiveness of a web-based intervention that addresses
both alcohol use and sex risk in MSM completing HIV self-testing. Research Component 2 (PI: Kahler) extends
our work on behavioral telehealth interventions to reduce alcohol misuse in HIV-infected MSM by testing our
previously developed video counseling and text messaging interventions in a diverse sample of patients in HIV
care at four large, urban federally-qualified health centers. Research Components 1 and 2 share a Hybrid Type
1 effectiveness-implementation trial design, providing data on real-world effectiveness while gathering data
related to implementation to inform future studies. Research Component 3 (MPI: Becker and Kuo)
complements these projects by conducting an implementation trial that evaluates a cascading training model to
promote alcohol screening and brief intervention across HIV care settings in South Africa. Together, these
projects—supported by an Administrative Core, Research Methods Core, and Program Advisory Committee
and complemented by an outstanding training program in alcohol-HIV research with robust pilot funding
opportunities—will make a substantial impact in translating basic and applied knowledge on alcohol and HIV
into scalable approaches to reducing the negative impact of alcohol misuse on HIV prevention and care."
10759428,"Summary – Overall Component
Cellular communication between diverse cells is now recognized to heavily influence both cancer initiation and
progression. Recently, several new forms of intercellular communication have been recognized, including
exchange of proteins and RNAs via extracellular vesicles (EVs) and other carriers. Extracellular RNA (ExRNA)
is particularly interesting, as it has the potential to influence gene expression and potentially epigenetic states.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) in particular have been shown to be transferred from one cell type to another to
influence gene expression; however, it is clear that many kinds of exRNAs are selectively secreted from cells.
What is less clear is how those exRNAs (including miRNAs) are packaged into EVs and other carriers. In
addition, the overall impact of these exRNAs on cells and tissues is not yet understood. In this program, we
propose to elucidate the “rules of the game” for extracellular RNA communication, using colorectal carcinoma
(CRC) as a model system. Our Program will be highly synergistic, because each Project focuses on a different
aspect of this problem. Thus, Project 1 will determine how subcellular contacts between organelles drive RNA
and RNA-binding protein (RBP) transfer to EVs in CRC. Project 2 will identify RNA modifications and
sequences that drive molecular selection of RNAs for transfer into EVs in CRC. Project 3 will identify how EVs
and exomeres mediate EGFR-Wnt crosstalk in CRC. All Projects use common experimental systems, including
CRC isogenic cell models, and have common biological focus (e.g. how miR-100 and miR-125b are trafficked
and influence recipient cell function in CRC). Integration, synergy, and progress of the Projects will be highly
enhanced by the proposed Administrative and Shared Resource Cores. Together this Program will make a
major impact in the areas of CRC, tumor microenvironment, exRNA, EVs, and RNA biology."
10883711,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cardiovascular disease is the #1 cause of mortality in the United States and stroke is the #5 cause. Stroke is
also the #1 cause of disability, and it, along with covert neurovascular disease including small vessel disease
of the brain, leads to Vascular Cognitive Impairment and Dementia (VCID). Each year 800,000 Americans have
a stroke and 720,000 Americans have myocardial infarction. There will be 75 million people with dementia by
2030 and 131 million by 2050. Direct annual costs of cardiovascular disease and stroke are $318 billion and
dementia $277 billion. The American Heart Association issued a Presidential Advisory in 2017 highlighting the
central role of cardiovascular health to brain health and cognitive function. Much of VCID is driven by increases
in covert stroke and small vessel disease of the brain, research areas of expertise for the PIs of this
application. To address these issues, this University of Vermont (UVM) Center on Cardiovascular and Brain
Health (VCCBH) will leverage NIH funding and institutional commitment to convene multidisciplinary
researchers across career stages to determine causes and suggest optimal treatments for cardiovascular and
neurovascular disease, including stroke and VCID. We have selected four junior faculty (Project Directors,
PDs), from three departments and two UVM colleges, through a rigorous selection process. The VCCBH will
support the PDs' transition to independence using a Strategic Mentoring Initiative (SMI), Faculty Development
Program (FDP), and assistance and education from two new Core facilities. The SMI will employ
multidisciplinary Mentor Teams, including Peer Mentors. The FDP will comprise several educational programs
highlighted by an annual 2-Day Research Symposium, and an impactful Pilot Grant program (supported by
institutional commitments) that will provide $200,000 to four interdisciplinary research teams of junior faculty.
We will establish two new Core facilities: Study Design and Molecular Epidemiology, and Customized
Physiology and Imaging. A pipeline of new project directors will be developed from a pool of 19 current
candidates and five new junior faculty, who will be recruited with committed institutional support. Capstones of
the Center will include continual quality evaluation, clear communication and commitment to diversity. By the
completion of Phase I of funding, the Center will be on a strong path to sustainability in research excellence."
11092957,"Project Summary/Abstract
Opioid use disorders, co-occurring with either depression or PTSD, are prevalent, burdensome, and too often
left untreated. In 2015-16, there were over two million adults with a current OUD; 62% had a co-occurring
mental illness and 24% had a co-occurring serious mental illness. However, despite the effectiveness of
treatment, many individuals never receive treatment; and, when treatment is provided, quality is low. This is a
critical treatment and quality gap in a vulnerable and stigmatized population.
Collaborative care (CC) aims to address these gaps, and ground-breaking studies conducted by our team have
shown that CC improves access, quality and outcomes in primary care patients with common mental health
conditions, including addiction. However, CC has never been tested with co-occurring disorders (COD),
despite research by our team suggesting it may be effective. CC consists of a team of providers that includes a
care manager (CM), a primary care provider (PCP) and a behavioral health consultant (BHC), who provide
evidence- and measurement-based care to a panel of patients using a clinical registry. In our CC model for
COD (CC-COD), the CC team also includes a behavioral health psychotherapist (BHP); the evidence-based
treatments supported include medications for OUD (MOUD), pharmacotherapy for depression and PTSD,
motivational interviewing (MI), problem solving therapy (PST) and Seeking Safety (SS). We build upon our
prior research by emphasizing patient engagement and using a collaborative planning and development
process to adapt the intervention for a setting that is resource-poor with few medical and behavioral health
providers, and a highly stigmatized patient population with multiple interacting complex disorders.
We propose a multi-site, randomized pragmatic trial in 11 rural and urban primary care clinics located in Health
Professional Shortage Areas (HPSA) of New Mexico to adapt, harmonize and then test whether CC-COD
improves access, quality and outcomes for primary care patients with co-morbid OUD and depression and/or
PTSD. New Mexico has one of the highest opioid overdose death rates, and the CDC projects it will have the
highest rates of death from drugs, alcohol and suicide in the nation by 2025. A primarily rural state, it is
majority Hispanic. We will collaborate with the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, First Choice
Health Care system, UNM’s North Valley Health Center, and Hidalgo Medical Services to conduct the study.
We will randomize 1,000 patients with co-occurring OUD and and/or depression/PTSD to receive either CC-
COD or enhanced usual care (EUC). Our primary outcomes are rates of MOUD initiation (access), quality of
care for OUD, depression and PTSD (quality), self-reported physical and MH and wellbeing, and abstinence
from opioids (outcomes). We will also examine mediators and moderators of treatment quality and outcomes,
and assess contextual factors affecting implementation and sustainability."
11081913,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The NIH's HEAL Initiative aims to support collaboration between clinical research experts in academia and
industry to accelerate the development of highly efficacious, non-addictive analgesics for well-defined chronic
pain syndromes. The University of Rochester (UR), and its proposed leadership for the UR Hub and Spokes
within Early Phase Pain Investigation Clinical Network (EPPIC-Net), have extensive expertise in designing and
conducting analgesic trials of small molecule drugs, devices, and biologics. These trials have included both
investigator-initiated phase 2 trials and participation multi-site industry-sponsored clinical trials with a main
focus on well-phenotyped chronic low back pain (CLBP) syndromes, which is one of the top priorities for the
NIH's proposed EPPIC-Net. Currently, there are thirteen committed potential protocol PIs at the UR Hub and
four Spokes. Together these PIs have the ability to recruit subjects with a broad range of pain conditions from
the following subspecialties: anesthesiology, dentistry, emergency medicine, gastroenterology, gynecology,
neurology, neurosurgery, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, rheumatology, and urology. Each of these
committed potential PIs has extensive clinical trial experience and existing infrastructure to support patient
recruitment and retention, timely and accurate data entry, and regulatory documentation. In addition, the
proposed UR-EPPIC-Net Collaboration Core is well equipped to recruit additional Spoke sites using the
members' broad, regional and national network of analgesic researchers. UR has multiple resources to
promote efficient subject recruitment and trial quality, including (1) the UR Clinical and Translational Science
Institute's Trial Hub Liaison Team and Recruitment Unit, Community Engagement Studios, and Clinical
Research Center; (2) the Practice-Based Research Network of regional primary care practices; and (3) the
Office for Human Subject Protection – Quality improvement division. The UR also has multiple resources to
support deep phenotyping of chronic pain patients, including (1) the Neuroimaging Core, (2) the
Neuromuscular Pathology Laboratory, (3) quantitative sensory testing expertise, and (4) the Physical Exercise
Activity Kinesiology Laboratory. This proposal outlines a leadership and oversight infrastructure to allow for the
nimble, efficient, and high integrity implementation of EPPIC-Net clinical trials. Institutional leadership
commitments include the use of a central Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the adoption and
implementation of master trial agreements templates. As a result, the proposed UR-EPPIC-Net Hub and
Spokes are well positioned to work with the EPPIC-Net Data and Clinical Coordination Centers to design and
rapidly conduct phase II therapeutic trials across a broad range of pain conditions, and to set new standards
for conception, implementation, and dissemination of pain research."
10766719,"OVERALL SUMMARY. Major depressive disorder (MDD) topped heart disease as the number one cause of
disability worldwide, and women have twice the risk of men. MDD is associated with abnormalities in the stress
response circuitry, areas that are among the most sexually dimorphic in the brain. These areas are dense in
sex steroid and glucocorticoid receptors coupled with cytokine receptors. Further, activity in these areas has
been associated with cortisol response, autonomic dysfunction, and immune responses, which we showed
differed by sex. This is important since autonomic dysregulation is significantly associated with cardiovascular
disease. In fact, women are at twice the risk for the co-occurrence of MDD, autonomic dysregulation and heart
disease, leading to a 3-5-fold risk of death in women from heart disease, often with unrecognized and
untreated MDD. Thus, understanding early biomarkers for sex differences in MDD and autonomic
dysregulation will provide knowledge for early intervention, attenuating later life disability, in particular for
women who are at higher risk. The scientific mission of this SCORE is to identify stress-immune pathway
abnormalities, beginning in fetal development, that have shared consequences for sex differences in brain
circuitry regulating mood and lifelong recurrent MDD and dysregulation of hormone and immune responses to
stress, and autonomic and neurovascular dysfunction in early midlife. We aim to facilitate transdisciplinary,
translational collaboration among basic and clinical investigators to enhance our understanding of the impact of
sex on MDD and central and peripheral autonomic function and provide the groundwork for translating this
knowledge into sex-selective therapeutics. Further, we aim to serve as an interdisciplinary resource to train
and disseminate findings about sex differences in MDD and autonomic dysregulation to the scientific and
medical communities, policy makers, and the public. To accomplish this, three integrated studies are proposed:
1) a clinical population neuroscience study relating prenatal risk biomarkers to sex differences in brain circuitry
and physiologic deficits in response to stress in MDD in early midlife; 2) clinical study using direct
transcutaneous neuromodulatory stimulation of the vagus nerve, auricular branch (or taVNS) to target the
circuitry associated with stress-immune function and map its neuroanatomic, physiologic and clinical effects in
MDD by sex, in the same subjects as in project 1; and 3) rodent model studies that will map out the central
mechanistic pathways involved in projects 1 and 2. In addition, three cores will contribute to the success of this
SCORE: 1) Leadership Administration Core to administer and oversee the administrative integration of the
studies and cores; 2) Resources Core to provide shared technical expertise across studies; and 3) Career
Enhancement Core, to supplement the training of junior faculty and others on the topic of our SCORE, and
become pedagogical ambassadors to the scientific, medical and public communities about sex differences in
depression and comorbidities with general medicine, a topic with global public health implications."
10796810,"Project Summary:
The overall goal of this new center is to facilitate the growth of young intellectual talent and build the scientific
infrastructure that will promote biomedical research discoveries that will enhance our understanding of the
metabolic aspects of different diseases. Specifically, we have identified four junior faculty with research interests
in different, but complementary aspects of disease research. Each Research Project focuses on the metabolic
aspect of a disease (anxiety/food intake, diabetes, cancer, and preeclampsia). Despite the diversity in tissues
and diseases of interest, each project strongly fits into Pennington Biomedical’s general mission, to discover the
triggers of chronic diseases through innovative research that improves human health across the lifespan.
Within this Metabolic Basis of Disease (MBD) COBRE proposal, we are developing two new scientific cores. The
first is a Preclinical Research Core, which brings together strengths of our current Comparative Biology Core,
Animal Models and Behavior Core, and Transgenics Mouse Core. The second new core is a Molecular
Mechanisms core that will integrate aspects of our Genomic Cores and Cell Biology Bioimaging Core to provide
mentoring and technical support for the Research Project PIs and PBRC faculty."
11084580,"Transcriptional elongation and mRNA processing occur simultaneously and are highly coupled to increase the
efficiency and accuracy of mRNA maturation. Splicing is a step of mRNA processing where intronic regions are
removed by spliceosome complexes that bind pre-mRNA. Most human genes with multiple exons are
alternatively spliced generating numerous proteins with diverse functions derived from a single gene. Defects in
RNA polymerase that alter the transcription elongation rate cause pervasive changes in alternative splicing.
Mutations in transcriptional processing cause a variety of human diseases including retina degeneration, which
is characterized by photoreceptor cell loss and visual dysfunction that can lead to blindness. Notably, the human
retina harbors an astonishing splicing diversity and several retina-specific mRNA isoforms and ubiquitously
expressed splicing factors are associated with retinal disease. Retinal photoreceptors, cones and rod cells,
constitute over 70% of cells in the retina and initiate the transmission of visual stimuli to the brain by detecting
light photons through a molecular pathway known as phototransduction. Many retinal mutations occur in
phototransduction genes including rhodopsin, the only photopigment and highest expressed gene in rods. To
date, the mechanisms that regulate the precise temporal and quantitative expression of rhodopsin and other
phototransduction genes are poorly understood. My preliminary data suggest that the rod-specific transcription
factor NRL physically interacts with splicing proteins. I hypothesize that qualitatively and quantitatively precise
expression of phototransduction genes are controlled stringently by molecular interactions between the splicing
and transcriptional machineries. In this proposal, genetic, biochemical and genomic approaches in combination
with high throughput technologies, will be used to identify protein interactions between the transcriptional and
splicing machineries. In addition, the role of these interactions will be studied in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore,
genomic regions of phototransduction genes associated with RNA polymerase regulation and splicing factor
binding will be identified. This grant will expose me to new technologies and computational analysis that will
allow me to comprehensively study mechanisms of gene regulation and retinal homeostasis. Overall, this funding
opportunity will help me become a well-rounded scientist and achieve research independence in the area of
molecular genetics and vision research."
10746432,"Abstract LSUHSC CARC Overall
The Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center New Orleans (LSUHSC-NO) Comprehensive Alcohol-
HIV/AIDS Research Center (CARC) is a multi-institutional, multidisciplinary team of scientists from LSUHSC and
the Tulane National Primate Research Center (TNPRC) and School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine
(TSPHTM) with a research focus on the interaction of alcohol use disorder (AUD), human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV), and antiretroviral therapy (ART). The translational focus is the impact of at-risk alcohol consumption
on risk for comorbidities in a longitudinal cohort of in-care virally-suppressed persons living with HIV (PLWH).
We have demonstrated the relevance of the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) nonhuman primate (NHP)
model to the clinical setting, revealed the deleterious impact of alcohol despite viremic control in in-care PLWH,
and identified environmental (neighborhood) and behavioral (diet) factors that affect disease course and severity.
The proposed studies evolve, expand, and refine our research strategy to a mechanistic bidirectional (NHP‒
PLWH‒NHP) translational investigation of the impact of AUD, HIV, and ART on comorbid conditions in an
underserved cohort of PLWH. The scientific premise of the proposed studies is the observation that intestinal
mucosa is an early site of alcohol-induced immunopathogenic changes in the alcohol-consuming, HIV/SIV-
infected host that culminates in loss of mucosal barrier function and gut leak that promotes chronic immune
activation, inflammation, and senescence, which we hypothesize increases risk for comorbidities in PLWH. An
Administrative Core provides oversight, supports data management and analysis, and funds pilot projects to
promote novel research investigations. Four Research Components (RCs) study in-care underserved PLWH
and a sex- and age-matched HIV- control group, complemented by mechanistic studies in SIV+ and SIV- NHPs.
RC1 investigates the impact of community and interpersonal stress on behavioral and chronic comorbidities
among PLWH and the unique role that alcohol consumption plays in the pathways. RC2 and RC3 elucidate
pathophysiological mechanisms of two comorbidities: metabolic dysregulation and neurological deficits. RC4
investigates the immunological mechanisms driving the balance between immune activation and activation-
induced cell death that contribute to cell senescence and tissue injury with alcohol exposure. An Experimental
and Analytical Resource Core provides support for all proposed studies. An Information Dissemination Core
promotes training and accelerates the translation and dissemination of research findings to the scientific, health
care, and lay communities. The CARC will continue to leverage and synergize with existing institutional
resources. Access to a unique HIV+ population in a southeast urban region, the established expertise of CARC
investigators in biomedical and behavioral research, state-of-the-art research facilities, outstanding scientific
environment, and strong institutional support will ensure that the proposed CARC projects will continue to
advance our understanding of the comorbid consequences of AUD, HIV/SIV, and ART in PLWH."
10862770,"Project Summary/Abstract
It is well understood that rural populations, especially rural children, suffer disproportionately from several
chronic diseases and risk factors that adversely impact quality of life. For example, rurality is associated with
higher infant mortality, increased rates of lower respiratory tract infection hospitalization among infants and
young children and lower rates of early childhood vaccinations for preventable disease. Resources and studies
targeting rural heath have primarily focused on addressing problems of access to healthcare services and
healthcare professionals, but improving overall health and reducing risks among rural children also requires a
more comprehensive understanding of how prevention strategies can be developed for, adapted to, and tested
in rural communities. Our overall goal is to build a sustainable Center for Prevention Research (CPR). The
CPR is designed to support researchers in advancing across the prevention research continuum from state-of-
the-art epidemiological and modeling CPR projects to R01-funded intervention research that is informed and
developed through CPR support. Several key barriers limit the potential for developing a rural-oriented center
focused on prevention research for children’s health, including (1) limited access to electronic health records;
(2) modeling resources and methods that are primarily oriented to urban settings; (3) evidenced based
intervention strategies that have been primarily developed for, and tested within, urban communities but few
solutions that have been designed with input from rural-based stakeholders; and (4) challenges to establishing
a critical mass of scientifically competitive investigators. The CPR is specifically designed to address these
barriers and will achieve its overall goal through three specific aims. First, CPR will support, develop and
expand a critical mass of researchers in Montana addressing rural children’s health issues. The Administrative
Core will actively recruit new prevention researchers to the CPR through a variety of mechanisms including
new hires, pilot projects and collaborations with other Montana campuses. Second, CPR will establish
research cores that provide Center investigators with state-of-the-art technical tools and expertise to conduct
epidemiological and modeling and transition to development and testing of intervention strategies to protect
children’s health. The Data and Modeling Core will provide CPR researchers with a centralized resource that
houses state-of-the-art data acquisition and management of sensitive data; biostatistics and modeling
expertise; and high performance computational resources. The Stakeholder Engagement and Intervention
Support Core will provide CPR researchers with survey and qualitative methods support to inform rural and
stakeholder informed interventions Third, and ultimately, CPR will create a sustainable Center-based culture
that fosters multidisciplinary success around prevention research for rural children’s health through mentoring,
collaborative exchange and support for scholarly productivity and achievement."
10870121,"Older women experience dramatic changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis and female
reproductive hormones, producing vasomotor symptoms (VMS), sleep problems, cognitive changes, and
cardiometabolic risks, which increase susceptibility to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and dementia. VMS occur
in 85% of women and persist in one-third for 10+ years after menopause, potentially leading to prolonged
disruption of quality of life, sleep disturbance, cardiometabolic risk, and extended VMS treatment, conferring
further risk for CVD and dementia. Such health outcomes may also be influenced by stress exposures across
the lifespan and during pregnancy, which may exert their effects through neural mechanisms. Brigham and
Women’s Hospital (BWH) and Harvard Medical School (HMS) seek to establish a SCORE to advance our
understanding of stress exposures and neural regulation of reproductive aging health outcomes, and to
catalyze growth of translational women’s health and sex-differences research in aging women. We will pursue
novel translational science through three Projects: Project 1 (Joffe/Mahon; clinical science) will define evoked
stress responsivity, stress-related activation of neural networks on functional brain imaging, and GABA
concentrations as markers of VMS occurrence and persistence, including compounding effects of poor sleep
and stress exposures. Project 2 (Oken/Chavarro; population science) will determine whether perimenopausal
women with higher exposure to social stressors across the lifespan and physiological stressors across
pregnancy have greater cardiometabolic risk, sleep, cognitive, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Project 3
(Kaiser/Navarro; basic science) will characterize the role of kisspeptin, neurokinin, and dynorphin (KNDy)
neurons and upstream GABAergic neurons in mediating the effects of stress and corticosteroids on the HPG
axis, VMS, and sleep disturbances in a rodent model. These scientific efforts will receive critical support from
our Cores: The Sleep Resource Core (Klerman) will extend our scientific impact by investigating sleep
outcomes in humans and rodents. The Career Enhancement Core (Rexrode/Rich-Edwards) will promote early-
career and new sex-differences investigators by supporting Scholars, Pilot Projects, Travel Exchange
Fellowships, and a robust educational program. The Leadership Administrative Core (Joffe/Manson) will
provide scientific and administrative oversight and engage with the SCORE Consortium. Building on existing,
fruitful collaborations, our outstanding interdisciplinary team of investigators—leaders in women’s health, sleep
medicine, neuroimaging, neuroendocrinology, stress science, cognition, cardiometabolic, and reproductive
epidemiology—will leverage robust resources at the Connors Center for Women’s Health and Gender Biology
and across synergistic women’s health and sleep programs at BWH. This SCORE will produce a significant
public health impact by advancing our understanding of the role and mechanisms of stress in producing
reproductive aging health outcomes that are linked with CVD and dementia susceptibility in aging women."
10804628,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - OVERALL
We propose to establish a Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) in Pharmaceutical Research
and Innovation at the University of Kentucky (UK). CPRI will serve as a comprehensive multidisciplinary center
focused on translational chemical biology [the nexus of chemical biology (the application of chemical biology
principles to develop validated probe/models to advance our understanding of biology) and pharmaceutical
science (the application of pharmaceutical principles to advance leads/materials/devices that address unmet
clinical needs)]. The COBRE will leverage and develop unique translational chemical biology research support
infrastructure/expertise to facilitate junior faculty mentorship and career development, innovative biomedical
research probe/tool/model/materials development and validation, and the early advancement of potential
‘translatable’ assets. Key COBRE infrastructure to be developed and implemented in Phase I includes the CPRI
Administrative Core and two research support cores (the Translational Core and the Computational Core) and
the COBRE will also further develop and leverage the COBRE for Molecular Medicine’s Organic Synthesis Core
to support CPRI junior faculty projects/pilots. CPRI will initially support four outstanding junior investigators
working in three therapeutic areas (cancer, infectious disease and cardiovascular disease).
 Our overarching hypothesis is that CPRI’s translational chemical biology focus presents a distinctly unique
UK platform to: i) engage, integrate and mentor junior faculty from a broad range of fundamental, applied and
clinical disciplines; ii) facilitate the development of new impactful probes/tools/models and advance innovative
transdisciplinary research; and iii) bridge the gap between basic academic research discoveries and
commercial/clinical application via education, mentorship and key support infrastructure. CPRI’s distinct focus
on translational chemical biology and early translation fills a notable preclinical research gap for many of UK’s
exceptional research centers strategically focused on understanding, treating and preventing the major diseases
that contribute to Kentucky’s disproportionate health challenges. Anticipated COBRE outcomes include an
increase in the number and diversity of UK junior faculty engaged in translational chemical biology research and
better-prepared to develop and employ innovative biomedical probes/tools/models/materials, new sustainable
UK translational chemical biology research support infrastructure and capabilities, an increase in the number of
UK junior faculty with independent research funding, and a boost in the number potentially ‘translatable’ UK
preclinical assets."
11098981,"SUMMARY
Background: The US is in the midst of an opioid epidemic and evidence-based treatment for opioid use
disorders (OUD) requires medications. Two medications for OUD (MOUD)—buprenorphine and injectable
naltrexone—can be provided in primary care (PC). Systems of team-based PC show promise for improving
access and retention in OUD treatment. One such model, collaborative care (CC), includes a care manager,
supervised by experts, who supports PC teams in providing evidence-based high-quality OUD care for OUD.
However, many patients with OUDs have mental health and other substance use (MH/SU) disorders and
chronic pain, which complicate OUD engagement and retention. While CC improves outcomes of depression,
other MH/SU conditions and pain, it is unknown how to optimally integrate CC for OUD with CC for other
MH/SU disorders. Objective: This pragmatic trial tests whether an innovative, scalable, telephonic model of CC
for OUD and comorbid conditions increases engagement in MOUD treatment and improve depression
symptoms in PC patients with OUD and depression. Study team: Senior investigators with expertise leading
pragmatic PC trials of CC for OUD, depression, anxiety, PTSD, alcohol use disorders, and chronic pain, have
partnered with clinical experts in PC management of OUD and comorbid conditions, to design and test a novel,
scalable, telephonic model of CC. Intervention: This telephonic CC model includes the 6 key elements of CC,
as well as shared decision-making regarding comorbid conditions of concern to patients, and will be refined in
a developmental phase in year 1. Pragmatic trial sample and design: Years 2-4, the proposed effectiveness
trial will test our CC model in at least 800 PC patients with OUD and depression, followed over 12 months (at
least 400 each from Kaiser Permanente Washington and University of New Mexico PC clinics). Innovative
pragmatic elements of this trial include: inclusion of all eligible patients with OUD and active depression (PHQ-
9 ≥ 10) seen in participating PC clinics during trial enrollment (both sites routinely screen for depression with
the PHQ-9); 50% of the sample will be randomly recruited for and consented for the CC intervention; and main
outcomes will be measured in the entire eligible sample using only secondary data from electronic health
records, insurance claims, and state-wide prescription monitoring program and emergency department
information exchanges. These pragmatic elements avoid studying only motivated (recruited) patients and
avoids activating patients randomized to usual care. Main outcomes include 1) 6 months of sustained MOUD
during 12-months follow-up (primary) and 2) resolution of depression symptoms based on the PHQ-9. A
secondary outcome, any major adverse events, includes: suicide attempt, self-harm, overdose, hospitalization
or death. Analyses compare the 50% of eligible patients offered the CC intervention (irrespective of enrollment
or engagement) to those who are not, in an intention to treat analysis. Public Health Impact: As part of the
project's deployment-focused approach, the investigative team will evaluate implementation processes and
actively disseminate trial findings to improve outcomes of patients with OUD seen in PC nationwide."

 This is a new application for a P30 ADRC at Columbia University, continuing the tradition of our previous
P50 ADRC that has existed at Columbia since 1989. Building off our prior accomplishments, the overall objective
of the new ADRC is to support and promote cutting-edge research on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related
disorders, both locally in our extensive campus and more globally with other institutions and national consortia.
Subsumed within this objective the Center will have a more focused theme. The theme, focusing on ‘biological
pathways’ implicated in AD pathogenesis, was decided on after internal deliberations, discussions with our
External Advisory Committee members, and with NIH project officers. As reviewed throughout the proposal, we
believe that this broad theme has many advantages. It will strengthen the overall objective by better serving our
local community of basic, translational, and clinical investigators; and will generate new tools and resources that
we will share with other institutions, consortia, and organizations. Additionally, the theme will allow each core to
have both general aims that harmonize with other ADRCs and consortia, and theme-guided aims that emerge
from our local strengths. As reviewed below, the theme will allow cores to synergize and work together in
creating a research infrastructure that relate to the clinical phenomenology, neuropathology, neuroimaging, and
genomics of AD.
 Since its inception 30 years ago, the ADRC at Columbia has established an elaborate infrastructure for
research, fostered interdisciplinary collaborations, established a rich training environment, and promoted
outreach and patient recruitment. At the same time the Center has become an active participant in a more global
network comprised of other institutions, national consortia, and community organizations. During the many
cycles of the P50 ADRC, the Center has attained most of its goals, as evidenced, for example, by the breadth of
its scientific findings and by its high ranking of enrolled and active patients.
 In this proposal for a new P30 ADRC we will build off of these prior accomplishments moving forward, and
will be motivated by two general goals. The first goal is to continue, as in previous cycles, to foster all research
on AD and related disorders, while the second goal is to support the theme. We propose to achieve these goals
through our well-integrated cores, which collectively establishes an infrastructure that generates a rich array of
resources, biospecimens, and expertise. Besides the Administrative Core, these cores include a Clinical Core
led by Dr. Lawrence Honig, a ‘Data Management and Statistical’ Core led by Dr. Howard Andrews, a
Neuropathology Core led by Dr. Andrew Teich, a Biomarker Core led by Dr. Adam Brickman, a Genetics Core
led by Dr. Christiane Reitz, a Neuroimmunology Core led by Dr. Phillip De Jager, an ‘Outreach, Retention, and
Engagement’ Core led by Dr. William (Ted) Huey, and a ‘Research Education’ Module led by Dr. James Noble."
10792929,"Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major, growing global public health problem. This is a daunting scientific
challenge and solutions will come only from innovative research. We have brought together a unique
interdisciplinary team of investigators with the goal of bridging the divide between state-of-the-art technologies
and translational applications.
To monitor AD disease progression or response to treatment, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) represents the
preferred fluid to reflect brain pathophysiology. The brain interstitial fluid is in direct contact with the CSF by
unrestricted bidirectional flow of proteins and the CSF is protected from the peripheral system because of the
 𝛽
restricted transportation of molecules and proteins by the blood-brain barrier. Known CSF biomarkers have
been demonstrated to reflect the three main pathological changes that occur in the AD brain -- amyloid-
deposition, neurofibrillary degeneration, and neuronal injury. Therefore, analysis of molecules and particles in
CSF holds the greatest potential to improve our diagnosis and characterization of neurodegenerative diseases
in vivo.
We propose to enable precision medicine for AD by developing a cooperative research program that will unite
a unique research team with the specific goal of vastly improving the molecular characterization of CSF as
predictors of cognitive decline and AD pathophysiology. The efforts of this program will complement existing
efforts to accelerate the identification and validation of clinically relevant therapeutic targets. We will work in
parallel with programs like Accelerating Medicines Partnership (AMP) and the AD Centers Program, to provide
unique diagnostic capabilities in support of the process of bringing new medicines to patients.
Our U19 research program will consist of four projects and four cores that are synergistic to our mission.
Moreover, our research team is uniquely suited to the development, validation and translational application of
new biomolecular assays to reflect AD pathophysiology. This U19 will harness the collective expertise of
multiple fields, combined with the financial resources sufficient to extend and apply next generation proteomics
technologies to clinical specimens that have been extensively annotated with longitudinal, consensus clinical
diagnostic and neuropsychological test data. We will create new assays with the goal of deployment to the
clinical lab. We will create unique and sustainable reagents that will facilitate dissemination and deployment of
these methods worldwide. Our program will expand existing infrastructure, developed by our labs, for sharing
and disseminating these data and protocols. The application of new technologies, development of novel
reagents, creation of new clinical assays, and dissemination of data and protocols will accelerate neuroscience
in a way not feasible under traditional NIH mechanisms."

The overall goal of the Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) in Digestive & Liver Diseases
(CDLD) is to enable outstanding multidisciplinary collaborative research in digestive and liver diseases at the
Medical University of South Carolina. These diseases are of importance to the state of South Carolina because
of the tremendous, disproportionate burden they have upon the state’s citizens. The specific aims are to: 1)
Mentor, train, recruit and retain a cadre of early career scientists to become independently funded investigators
in digestive and liver diseases research; 2) Develop sustainable scientific core resources to support digestive
and liver disease studies while leveraging institutional investments; and 3) Promote the long-term viability and
success of the CDLD through development of multidisciplinary basic science research programs, rigorous
evaluation, ongoing improvement strategies, and mission alignment with other centers at MUSC. The Center is
led by a multidisciplinary team of two department chairs within the MUSC College of Medicine, coalescing
resources to achieve their overarching objective of building a critical mass of funded investigators that will allow
MUSC to compete for future external peer-reviewed programmatic grant support. This application highlights four
of our most outstanding Junior Investigators (JIs) who will benefit from an innovative multiple source mentoring
plan which features both internal and external mentors. We anticipate each of these JIs to transition to
independent NIH funding within the first three years of the project. The CDLD also includes three Cores that will
support not only the JIs but also digestive and liver disease investigators throughout the medical center.
Scientific cores include the: 1) Cell Models Core, which will generate advanced cell models of digestive and liver
diseases; 2) Animal Models of Digestive Disease Core, which will provide access to and training in essential
animal models; and 3) Advanced Imaging Core, delivering sophisticated equipment, technologies and expertise
required for successful, state-of-the-art cell and tissue-based imaging and analysis. Additionally, the CDLD will
foster collaborations among digestive and liver disease researchers by promoting interdisciplinary scientific
exchange through our enrichment activities and build research capabilities through our Pilot Project Program.
With NIH and institutional support, the CDLD will attain our long-term goal of integratin basic, translational and
clinical research as a sustainable, multidisciplinary, programmatic center."
10897844,"Summary - Overall
Patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may have hundreds of cycles over the night of loss of airway
dilator motor tone and airway obstruction, followed by apnea, which is ended by an arousal, in which there is
EEG desynchronization accompanied by return of airway dilator muscle tone, opening of the airway, and re-
established ventilation. The EEG arousals cause sleep fragmentation and sleep loss, resulting in cognitive
impairment, and metabolic and cardiovascular consequences. We hypothesize that by augmenting brain
circuits that keep the airway open while suppressing the EEG arousals, we can prevent these outcomes. We
have found that the EEG arousal depends on two circuits, the CGRP-expressing neurons in the parabrachial
nucleus (PBCGRP cells), and the dorsal raphe serotonin neurons that provide input to them. The increase in
airway dilator tone, in part through genioglossus muscle (GG) tone, allows breathing to restart in OSA, and
relies on two different circuits: FoxP2 neurons in the PB (PBFoxP2 neurons) and medullary serotonin neurons
that innervate the medulllary respiratory control system. Project 1 will examine the effects on ventilation and
GG-EMG of activating or inhibiting the PBFoxp2 neurons optogenetically and the firing of PBFoxP2 neurons in real
time with calcium imaging,.at baseline and during CO2 exposure. It will then use chemogenetics to enhance
the firing of the PBFoxP2 neurons and ventilator (tidal volume, respiratory rate) and GG-EMG response, while
inhibiting the PBCGRP neurons and EEG arousal during CO2 exposure. Project 2 and 3 will run in parallel to
identify the forebrain inputs to the PBCGRP and PBFoxP2 neurons that activate them during EEG arousal. Their
shared strategy is to identify druggable receptors on the PB cells that respond to CO2, to suggest therapies
that can be used to augment firing of PBFoxP2 neurons and suppress PBCGRP neurons during CO2 exposure.
They will use single cell RNA-Seq to identify the receptors on these neurons, and rabies virus tracing
combined with channelrhodopsin-assisted circuit mapping to determine their inputs, and then GCaMP6 fiber
photometry to determine which of these inputs is activated during the EEG arousal that accompanies CO2
exposure. Project 4 examines the inputs to the respiratory control system from the medullary serotonin
neurons that are required to produce the ventilatory and GG-EMG response to CO2. It takes advantage of
identifying genetically distinct subsets of medullary serotonin neurons that innervate the sensory and motor
components of the respiratory control system. It will then identify the forebrain inputs to these different
serotonin neurons, to determine which ones activate them, and with what receptor types, during CO2
exposure. Finally, Project 5 will use information from Projects 1-4 that identifies druggable receptors that
increase airway dilator tone, while suppressing EEG arousals during sleep apnea. We expect with refinement
of the receptor types that need to be stimulated or inhibited, we can design drug combinations to keep the
airway open while preventing the EEG arousals that result in the long term deleterious consequences of OSA."

This COBRE application will form a unique research center on Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases
(EZID). Four primary research projects bridge areas of excellence in the Infectious Diseases programs at
Kansas State University (KSU) within the Colleges of Arts and Sciences and Veterinary Medicine. The
projects examine virulence factors and host-pathogen interactions of various pathogens, utilizing both basic and
translational approaches in in vitro systems and in animal models. The overarching goal of the EZID center is to
advance our understanding of emerging and zoonotic infectious diseases in the State of Kansas. Our goals are
also clearly aligned with NIH's strategic plan “Turning Discovery into Health”. Two research core facilities will
support the research projects and programs, an Animal Model/Pathology Core and a Molecular and Cellular
Biology Core, offering unique research infrastructure resources within KSU and the State of Kansas. The
success and growth of EZID will be enabled through various programs: (1) a faculty mentoring program that
will provide outstanding mentoring by nationally/internationally recognized mentors. The mentoring team will
implement individualized development plans, and support all aspects of research programs and grant application
processes to secure R01-level funding by the project leaders; (2) new faculty recruitment at KSU to ensure
the growth and sustainability of EZID, as well as productive use of core facilities; (3) a pilot and seed grant
program that will promote center growth by funding projects at universities within the State of Kansas; and (4)
a regional scientific network (RSN) that will provide inter-disciplinary and inter-institutional collaborations,
increased usage of core facilities, and access to additional core facilities and training opportunities. Initial
partners of the RSN include several COBREs within the State of Kansas and Nebraska, as well as the K-INBRE
center at the University of Kansas Medical School. The RSN will grow and expand both to other universities in
the region and to national COBRE centers working in the same mission space, thereby providing opportunities
for the rapid growth of research programs. These EZID programs will be the basis by which research productivity
is enabled and supported, helping to advance the overall success and reputation of the COBRE core projects,
pilot projects, post-doctoral and graduate student trainees, and associated EZID faculty. The EZID center will
host annual research symposia that will include participants from EZID projects and RSN members to showcase
and share research with investigators from inside and outside of the network, promoting the national and
international reputation of EZID."
10838580,"Project Summary/Abstract
The University of Mississippi proposes to establish the Glycoscience Center of Research Excellence
(GlyCORE), a Phase I Center of Biomedical Research Excellence. Glycoscience is an essential and rapidly
emerging field of biomedical science, and the challenging nature of glycoscience research requires tools and
expertise that are not commonly found in the biomedical research community. Moreover, the biomedical
community is rapidly growing to appreciate the essential role of carbohydrates, with researchers outside of the
self-identified “glycoscience” community finding themselves faced with addressing challenging questions in
glycoscience as part of the course of their biomedical researchers. GlyCORE will develop and provide
resources and expertise in glycoscience to both core glycoscience researchers as well as researchers who
encounter questions in glycoscience in the course of their biomedical research programs. GlyCORE will serve
researchers at both the University of Mississippi and the Mid-South community through three mechanisms: a
Faculty Development program, the establishment of three Research Cores to support glycoscience research,
and the establishment of local and regional meetings focusing on questions in glycoscience. GlyCORE's
Faculty Development program includes the support of four Junior Investigators establishing their careers in
various disciplines in glycoscience. This program includes financial support of the investigators' research
efforts, a formal mentoring program, and priority subsidized access to University of Mississippi core facilities.
GlyCORE will also support smaller developmental projects through a Pilot Project Program, including financial
support and prioritized access to core facilities. GlyCORE's Faculty Development program will also promote
recruitment of glycoscience faculty to the University of Mississippi, including the recruitment of a mid-career
carbohydrate synthetic chemist to help support expanded services in GlyCORE during Phase II. GlyCORE's
Research Cores will establish three new core capabilities at the University of Mississippi that are essential for
modern glycoscience: an Analytical and Biophysical Core supporting high resolution chromatography and
mass spectrometry analyses; an Imaging Core supporting confocal microscopy with lectin-based and anti-
carbohydrate immunohistochemistry imaging; and a Computational and Bioinformatics Core supporting
simulations and bioinformatics data analysis to support glycoscience and structural glycobiology. Finally,
GlyCORE will establish the University of Mississippi as a regional center for glycoscience in the Mid-South.
GlyCORE will host an annual Mid-South Glycoscience Meeting with subsidized access to regional participants,
and will host both an annual UM Glycoscience Symposium and monthly glycoscience meetings to highlight the
role of glycoscience at the University of Mississippi. Together, these efforts will establish a core of experienced
and nationally competitive young faculty in glycoscience, supported by modern research infrastructure and
promoted to the glycoscience community as the glycoscience destination in the Mid-South."
10771211,"The objective of this program is to establish a thematic multidisciplinary research center of excellence at the
University of Louisville (UofL) named the Center for Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy (CCII). The
mission of the CCII is to conduct outstanding biomedical research that works towards harnessing the power of
the immune system to eradicate cancer. There is currently a great deal of optimism about the prospects for
cancer immunotherapies given the recent clinical successes of immune checkpoint inhibitors, oncolytic viruses,
and adoptive cell transfer therapies. Immunotherapies have the potential to be used to treat all types of cancer
and to induce long-lasting remissions or cures. However, more research and development is needed for
cancer immunotherapy to reach its full potential. The University of Louisville is exceptionally qualified to be the
home of the CCII for many reasons including our 10-year track record of conducting clinical trials of
immunotherapeutic agents, unique resources that include access to human specimens from these trials, our
senior investigators’ expertise in cancer immunology, our focus on translational research, and the impact that
this COBRE would have in a state with the highest cancer death rates in the nation. Importantly, the University
of Louisville is highly invested in making this proposed center a success as best evidenced by more than
$16.8M in institutional commitments over five years. The two PIs of the CCII program are highly regarded
experts in the field who have made seminal contributions spanning from basic cancer immunology to pivotal
clinical trials of cancer immunotherapies. Senior mentors with expertise in the thematic area and a strong
history of funding, publications, mentoring, and study section service will support the CCII’s mentoring mission,
as will a team of co-investigators with essential expertise (in administration, biostatistics, and bioinformatics)
and Internal and External Advisory Committees. A Functional Immunomics Core will provide important new
infrastructure and leverage existing resources (including other IDeA programs) to provide outstanding support
to the four promising junior investigators who have been selected as the first cohort of CCII Project PIs. The
four overall specific aims of the CCII are to: (1) Establish the administrative and mentoring infrastructure for the
CCII; (2) Create a research core that provides new capabilities while leveraging existing facilities; (3) Support
the research and career development of junior PIs in the thematic area; and (4) Develop and initiate a plan for
long-term sustainability and growth of the CCII. We are confident that this new COBRE center will lead to the
awarding of innovative R01 grants for 4-6 CCII junior investigators in the first five years and that many of these
graduates will remain key members of this new COBRE to further build the center in the future. Most
importantly, our combination of rigorous basic science with highly translational animal and human specimen
studies should ultimately contribute to the development of new treatment strategies that will help to improve the
outlook for the more than 17 million people worldwide who are diagnosed with cancer each year."
10883581,"Inorganic metals have long been a focus of biomedical research in New Mexico, due to the high prevalence of
mining-related metal contaminants in the region. At the University of New Mexico Center for Metals in Biology
and Medicine (UNM CMBM) our main focus will be on both studying adverse health outcomes (including
cancer, pulmonary, neurologic, and other disorders) of metal contaminants as well as on harnessing the
chemical properties of metals for therapeutic and nutritional purposes. Detailed knowledge of molecular
interactions between metallic species and biomolecules can lead to clinical and population-level interventions
to improve public health. While heavy and transition metals exhibit both medical and toxicological
characteristics, the molecular and cellular interactions are often inadequately understood. The UNM CMBM
will combine expertise in inorganic chemistry, analytical chemistry, and metal mixtures toxicology to add
sophistication and translational value to the research of mentored principal investigators (mPIs). Recent
discoveries from members of the mentorship team and mPIs highlight the need for greater depth of molecular
inquiry in studying metal interactions with biomolecular targets, as such detailed understanding permits
improvements in receptor targeting (in the case of medicines) or innovative interventions (in the case of
environmental hazards). By providing intellectual expertise and advanced instrumentation to aid the mPIs'
research endeavors, we will enhance their funding opportunities and career progression to full independence.
The mentors in our program have a strong history of successful junior faculty career development, which we
will further enhance within the framework of this P20 Center by promoting the key concepts of multidisciplinary
team science and translational research approaches. Our long-term goal is to establish a nationally
recognized program of well-funded researchers conducting innovative research on metals toxicology and
biomedicine that has positive impacts on New Mexican and Southwestern communities. We will achieve this
goal through the following three specific aims: Aim 1. Create a strong community of independent investigators
with common research goals related to metals in medicine and biology. Aim 2. Establish centralized research
Integrative Molecular Analysis Core Facility by integrating existing UNM-Health Science Center (HSC)
scientific resources and building innovative facilities to improve bioanalytical chemistry research training and
productivity for mPIs, as well as to bolster research quality and depth for our institute. Aim 3. Create a unique
“Metals in Biology and Medicine” program that has clear T0-T4 translational value. The successful
implementation of this Center will lead to growth in independent research funding at UNM, especially among
junior investigators achieving independent career goals. The outcomes of our program have clear clinical and
public health benefit to populations and communities in the southwest, including the numerous Native
American populations disproportionately impacted by legacy waste from mining operations.

The mission of The Jackson Laboratory Cancer Center (JAXCC) is to discover precise genomic solutions for
cancer by making basic discoveries with human impact. Committed to our role as a basic research Cancer
Center, we harness our transdisciplinary strengths in complex genetics and functional genomics to achieve this
goal. Organized in a single research program, Genetic models for precision cancer medicine, the 53 full members
combine the JAXCC's unique capabilities to model human cancers in mice with innovations in genomic and
computational analytics of human cancers to attack this broad problem. From RNA biology to chromatin
dynamics, from organismal to in silico models of cancer, from panels of genetically diverse strains to humanized
mice, from single cell genomics to Patient Derived Xenografts, from genomic engineering technologies to
genomic diagnostics—The JAXCC brings advanced technologies to bear on persistent cancer problems through
collaborative partnerships with clinical investigators. Since 2013, we achieved unprecedented growth with 22
new members with expertise in immunology, computational biology, genomic technologies, epigenetics,
microbiome, tumor microenvironment, and clinical genomics. The Shared Resources (Cancer Model
Development Resource, Computational Sciences, Genetic Engineering Technologies, Genome and Single Cell
Technologies, and Phenotyping Technologies) provide comprehensive support for this wide range of research.
The collaborative environment, access to powerful technologies, and our use of Developmental Funds has
yielded significant advances: in the past 5 years, we have more than doubled our funding from NCI and other
cancer agencies and increased our overall intra-programmatic grant collaborative rate from 21% to 47%. Our
translational impact includes development of therapeutics exploiting genomic instability; our role as a discovery
engine for SWOG and our new community cancer genomic education initiative, the Maine Cancer Genomics
Initiative. In the next five years, the JAXCC will harness the collective energy of our expanded Cancer Center.
We will identify origins and the consequences of complex structural genomic alterations in cancer; we will craft
genetically complex models of cancer to uncover the systems biology of the disease; we will explore the cellular
dynamics of primary cancer cells in culture to uncover genetic causes of therapeutic insensitivity; and we will
explore tumor-microenvironment interactions through in vivo and in vitro tissue reconstructions. Our goal in the
next grant cycle is to bring several diagnostics and therapeutics to clinical development. In addition, we will
establish a Cancer Education and Career Enhancement core that supports a continuum of learning for students,
trainees, early career investigators and the Maine community oncology care providers. Our focus on complex
genetics and functional genomics, the scale of our model creation and experimentation, and the integration of
our diverse talents make the JAXCC a unique enterprise."

The program project grant’s (PPG’s) overarching goal is to make allogeneic hematopoietic cell
transplantation (allo-HCT) safer and more efficacious for patients with non-malignant and malignant blood
diseases. Towards this end, it will address importance of microbiome in mitigating the severity of graft-
versus-host disease (GVHD), the most significant complication of allo-HCT and improving outcomes after
allo-HCT. The proposal has a unifying central theme, specifically to understand the role of intestinal
microbial metabolite interactions with host metabolism and impact on intestinal GVHD. The proposed
projects in the PPG are independent and yet synergistic. It will integrate big data (cutting edge
technologies high throughput sequencing of genomes of microbial communities complemented by
metabolomes), mechanistic studies of fundamental microbial and mammalian biology in well-defined
HCT model systems and in humans, and, also importantly an IRB approved bench to bedside translation
of these into proof of concept prospective human clinical trial under an IND from FDA. The PPG brings
together investigators who are leaders from diverse fields into a cohesive group that has worked,
published together and bring their varied expertise to improve outcomes of allo-HCT for blood diseases.
The PPG being proposed will have four projects and four cores. All projects germinated from the common
unified preliminary datasets that were generated by project leaders over last several years. Project 1 will
explore the role of crosstalk between host intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) mitochondria and microbial
metabolites, specifically the short chain fatty acid (butyrate) in murine models of GVHD. In synergistic,
yet distinct line if investigation, project 2 will explore the role of host-microbiome interaction dependent
metabolites, secondary bile acids (SBAs), on IEC homeostasis and GVHD in murine models. Project 3
will delineate the critical microbes and the mechanisms employed by them in breaking down specific host
diet (resistant starch) to generate butyrate and SBAs. The role of dietary resistant starch on host
microbiome and metabolome and its impact on clinical GVHD will be explored in a proof of concept
clinical trial in project 4. These projects will be facilitated by state of the art Cores that include
Metabolomics, Gnotobiotics mice and bacterial phenotyping, Bioinformatics, Biostatistics and supported
by the Administrative Core. All of the investigators are from University of Michigan (a single institution)."
10756522,"PROJECT SUMMARY: OVERALL
The Fred Hutchinson/University of Washington Cancer Consortium (“the Consortium”) brings together more
than 600 members with research interests in basic, clinical and public health sciences related to cancer. The
goal of the Consortium is the elimination of cancer as a cause of suffering and death through more effective
prevention, diagnostics, and treatment, deriving from fundamental insights into the biology of the disease. The
extensive interdisciplinary collaboration among the partner institutions in the cancer research disciplines of
basic, clinical, and public health sciences affords new opportunities to reduce suffering and mortality from
cancer.
The Consortium was established in 2002 to build upon the complementary strengths and resources of three
partner institutions: the Fred Hutch, which has been an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center since
1976; the University of Washington, which has significant strength in cancer research, clinical care, and
teaching; and Seattle Children’s, the major pediatric academic center in the region. In 2008, the Seattle Cancer
Care Alliance, the cancer treatment center founded and equally co-owned by the three founding institutions,
was formally added to the cancer center designation.
The Consortium’s total funding base (direct dollars) is $242M, of which $117M is peer-reviewed, including
$50M from the NCI. During the last grant period, over 170 new faculty members joined the Consortium, adding
breadth and depth to our research and clinical capabilities. In the most recent year, we enrolled 1,338 patients
onto interventional treatment trials, of which more than 50% were investigator-initiated. The ratio of accruals to
newly registered patients was 28%.
The Consortium serves a catchment area of 13 counties in western Washington. This equates to the region in
which 83 percent of our patients reside. As the only NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center in a five-
state region (Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho), we not only seek to serve the health needs
of the catchment area through research, training, and outreach, but also to ensure high impact throughout the
larger region.
The Consortium continues to build upon historic strengths in basic cancer biology, immunology and
transplantation, pathogen associated malignancies, tumor specific translational research, computational
biology and studies of cancer etiology, prevention, and outcomes. The Consortium is well poised to continue its
exceptional level of research in these areas. The CCSG continues to have a high impact on the Consortium,
fostering new inter-institutional collaborations, strengthening the translational research platform, and
intensifying research efforts on problems of the catchment area. Partner institutions contributed nearly $1.2
billion in institutional support during the last project period, including investments in our laboratory and clinical
research infrastructure as well as in faculty recruitment and trainee support."
10796979,"Our proposed Yale-Specialized Center of Research Excellence (SCORE) on sex differences in alcohol use
disorder (AUD) brings together a team of leading basic and clinical science experts to pursue an
interdisciplinary, translational, cross-species program of research aimed at identifying novel therapeutics to
address the recent surge in rates of AUD in women. Over the past 10 years, rates of AUD in women have
increased by 84%, translating to 10.5 million women across the United States. Alcohol use is the third leading
cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the United States and women drinkers experience exacerbated
health risks associated with alcohol consumption when compared to men. FDA-approved medications for AUD
have relatively low efficacy, all were developed with samples of men, and none target factors that differentially
maintain drinking in women. A considerable body of data identifies that women are more likely to drink to
regulate negative affect and stress, while men are more likely to drink for alcohol-related positive
reinforcement. Koob & Volkow194 have developed a heuristic framework of the addiction cycle, where the
‘withdrawal/negative affect stage’ involves drinking motivated by stress and other negative affect states, also
termed ‘the dark side of addiction’. Neuroadaptations during this stage identify reward deficits and stress
surfeits, which drive compulsive drinking. Using this negative reinforcement model to guide our research, we
plan to target key brain structures, neurochemical systems, HPA-axis activity, neuroimmune function, alcohol
metabolism, and sex steroid hormones, which are hypothesized to differentially motivate alcohol consumption
in women. To date, there has not been a concerted effort to incorporate sex as a biological variable (SABV)
into AUD medication development. Consequently, the focus of our Yale-SCORE represents a high research
priority topic for both NIAAA and ORWH. We propose three Projects that will have inter-related and shared
goals, with each providing unique contributions to inform and expedite the development of AUD therapeutics
for women with AUD. The Projects will be supported by three Cores and an institutional environment with
exceptional resources and infrastructure to support translational science. Our specific aims and objectives of
the Yale-SCORE are to: AIM 1: Use a neurobiologically-informed approach focusing on the ‘dark side of
addiction’ to inform and expedite the development of sex-appropriate therapeutics targeting stress and
negative affect, which differentially maintain drinking in women. AIM 2: Mentor SCORE-Early Investigators to
become the next generation of biomedical and behavioral researchers focused on alcohol and women’s health
spanning the T1 to T4 translational spectrum. AIM 3: Be an institutional, regional, and national resource
galvanizing the study of sex differences in relation to alcohol use across T1 to T4 translation by providing
expert consultation, supporting faculty training awards, leveraging national data on sex and alcohol use to
inform treatment and policy, and providing a program of outreach and dissemination."

The Biology and Personalized Treatment of Primary and Metastatic Lung Cancer: The YSILC unites
translational scientists spanning diverse areas of cancer research to converge on addressing the challenge of
lung cancer. The goal of the YSILC is to reduce mortality from lung cancer through development of novel
therapeutics and treatment approaches that are based on an understanding of targetable biochemical and
immunological pathways involved in progression of lung cancer, acquisition of resistance, and development of
metastasis The YSILC translational research team will accomplish this objective through three projects:
Project 1: Test the hypotheses that Siglec-15 (S15) is a major immune suppressor in PD-L1/B7-H1-negative
lung cancer and that blockade of S15 can be efficacious for a subset of lung cancer patients; Project 2:
Evaluate mechanism-based approaches to counter tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance in EGFR-mutant lung
cancer; Project 3: Targeting lung cancer metastasis and drug resistance in the central nervous system. There
are three Cores (Administrative; Biostatistics and Bioinformatics; and Biospecimen, Pathology, and Genomics)
to support the projects and their clinical aims, mechanistic studies, and evaluation of biomarkers for clinical
application. Strong Developmental Research and Career Enhancement Programs (DRP, CEP) with a
history of choosing diverse and productive projects with good outcomes are also proposed. The highly
coordinated YSILC projects, cores, and programs are focused on developing novel lung cancer therapies, with
analysis of patient samples, cell-based assays, production of human cell lines and animal models of disease
as a guide to design prospective trials that translate these innovative targeted approaches to clinical therapies.
Each of these projects has a clinical trial (either investigator-initiated or NCI-based) designed to test the
sensitivity and resistance of the new therapy with molecular correlates. The expected translational outcomes of
the program include: (1) a highly coordinated and focused development of a novel immune agent discovered
during our current SPORE research; (2) an improved understanding of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of
resistance to EGFR therapies and how to combat it; (3) an understanding of the mechanism underlying brain
metastasis; (4) expanding the breadth of lung cancer research by developing the next generation of
investigators and encouraging established investigators in other fields to pursue studies on lung cancer
through our CEP and DRP programs."
10800648,"Abstract
The goal of this Phase-1 COBRE program is to develop and enhance the research
infrastructure, mentoring, and collaborative environment to support five Junior Investigators in
the multi-disciplinary fields of microbial pathogenesis and immunity. To achieve this goal, The
Oklahoma Center for Microbial Pathogenesis and Immunity (OCMP&I) COBRE will be
established and fostered as a center of excellence focused on advancing the careers of Junior
Investigators studying life-threatening infectious microbes and the ways in which the immune
system responds to infection. The OCMP&I COBRE will be centrally located at the University of
Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, the flagship academic institution for biomedical research in
Oklahoma. The OCMP&I COBRE will initially include 17 scientists engaged in microbial
pathogenesis and immunity research at research-intensive institutions in Oklahoma and this
network will be expanded during the Phase-1 period as the center takes form and grows.
Among these 17 scientists are five outstanding and promising Junior Investigators who study
fungal pathogenesis, inflammation, regulation of biofilms, and necrotizing enterocolitis. The
OCMP&I and its consortium of successful senior researcher scientists will provide the
intellectual input and expertise to mentor each Junior Investigator to research independence. In
addition to outstanding mentoring, The OCMP&I COBRE will provide the funding and research
core support needed for Junior Investigators to succeed and become long-term contributors to
the microbial pathogenesis and immunity research community in Oklahoma. Intertwined with
the Junior Investigator support, will be the OCMP&I COBRE's mission to address gaps in
infrastructure and resources that have limited the opportunities for cutting-edge research in our
state. To achieve these objectives, the OCMP&I COBRE will be guided by four overall specific
aims. Specific Aim 1: Establish a thematic center to enhance research, mentoring, and
infrastructure support for microbial pathogenesis and immunity research in Oklahoma, Specific
Aim 2: Select and support outstanding Junior Investigators, Specific Aim 3: Expand and
enhance infrastructure to support innovative and collaborative research in microbial
pathogenesis and immunity in Oklahoma. Specific Aim 4: Foster a culture of collaboration and
team-science by providing opportunities for frequent scholarly interactions and outreach through
seminars, symposiums, workshops, and pilot projects. Key elements for the success of the
center include 1) the establishment of a single, but highly facile research core, that can
immediately support the first group of Junior Investigator projects and expand to meet ever-
changing research needs of investigators in microbial pathogenesis and immunity, 2) up date
and modernize research laboratory space where Junior Investigators can work with established
investigators and benefit from daily interactions, 3) Develop a pipeline of future Junior
Investigators through targeted hires and through collaboration with a network of departmental
leaders on multiple campuses, 4) Utilize and capitalize on current IDeA program resources in
Oklahoma, and 5) Utilize an ongoing seminar program, sponsor a new annual symposium, and
support a grant-writing workshop to encourage collaborative interactions and exchange of ideas
among investigators in this multi-disciplinary area of research. Collectively, this five-year
Phase-1 COBRE program will establish the first center of research excellence in Oklahoma
focused on microbial pathogenesis and immunity and become the central entity that accelerates
research by all investigators in these fields and provides a highly-supportive path to
independence for our most promising Junior Investigators."

The Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center was founded as a matrix center within the Duke University School of
Medicine in 1972 and the Duke Cancer Institute (DCI) was created as a new administrative entity within Duke
Health in October 2010, with authority and responsibility for all cancer-related activities at Duke University and
in the Duke University Health System. The DCI was started with significant investments from Duke Health,
including a new $243M clinical care outpatient facility, over $60 million of new funds available to support new
initiatives, and a commitment for ongoing annual investment by the Duke Health System. DCI faculty include
well-established and funded experts spanning the full spectrum of cancer research fields, from intracellular
signaling to cancer genomics to therapeutic development and testing to population science. DCI programmatic
activities support the career development of the next generation of cancer experts and provide platforms for
multi-disciplinary scientific teams to develop and test new hypotheses. During the most recent funding period,
the DCI structure has continued to evolve and mature, currently consisting of 304 members from 34 departments
within 7 schools at Duke University (Medicine, Nursing, Arts and Sciences, Engineering, Public Policy,
Environment, and Business) and organized as 8 multi-disciplinary research programs (2 basic discovery, 1
population science, and 5 translational/clinical) whose work is supported by 14 Shared Resources (8 lab-based
and 6 supporting translational/clinical/population research activities). In addition to Program and Shared
Resource leaders, DCI senior leadership, which includes an Executive Director, Deputy Director, 7 Associate
Directors, and 8 other key leaders, provides oversight and direction of DCI initiatives. DCI members are currently
supported by over $111M of external cancer-related grant support (direct costs), over $63M of which is peer-
reviewed, including 32 peer-reviewed, multi-investigator grants (involving 81 subprojects/cores) and 61 training
and fellowship awards. DCI members published over 5,750 cancer-focused papers during the past funding
period, ~40% of which represent collaborative efforts between DCI investigators. On average, ~7,000 new
cancer patients are seen each year at the Duke University Hospital. In 2018, DCI Programs enrolled over 4,000
patients on clinical trials, including nearly 2,000 interventional accruals and 770 therapeutic accruals. DCI is
heavily engaged in both community outreach/engagement and educating the next generation of cancer clinicians
and scientists. Duke Health support of the DCI included a total of over $65M of additional investment in the most
recent funding period, including support for recruitment, retention, and protected academic time for DCI faculty.
The DCI completed an extensive 5-year Strategic Planning process, identifying strategic goals and priorities that
enable the DCI mission to “Discover, Develop, and Deliver the future of cancer care…now”, resulting in a series
of discrete recommendations that are serving as a guide for determining current and future resource allocation,
recruiting priorities, and infrastructure changes required to achieve DCI goals."
10903897,"ABSTRACT
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic normal transit constipation (CC) are prevalent intestinal disorders
which are more common in women. In addition, female IBS patients experience more pain during low estrogen
states, e.g. during the luteal phase of the menstrual period and post menopause. Until recently, there was no
consensus about the pathophysiology of these disorders, no satisfactory long term treatments, and no reliable
biomarkers for guiding treatment decisions. However, there is increasing evidence that disturbances at
different levels of the brain-gut microbiome (BGM) axis play a central role in the pathophysiology of IBS and
possibly CC. This proposal is based on the general hypothesis that female sex hormones and gut microbial
metabolites play an important modulatory role on brain gut microbiome interactions, and that ascending
arousal systems originating in the brainstem may in part responsible for the altered cognitive, affective and
sensory processing function resulting in increased perception of visceral and other sensory signals,
maladaptive coping, and comorbid anxiety characteristic for patient with functional GI disorders. Therefore, the
overall goal of this proposal is to identify the sex-specific effect of gut microbial metabolites, and estrogen
levels on ascending arousal pathways originating in distinct brainstem nuclei to change the activity and
connectivity of brain networks involved in symptom generation. Using advanced brain imaging methods, gut
microbiome analyses, and detailed clinical phenotyping, as well as state of the art statistical and bioinformatics
tools, this proposal is addressing the hypothesis in 3 synergistic and closely related Projects, assisted by a
Leadership Administrative Core and a Data Processing and Analysis Core. Project 1 aims to study the
influence of natural low estrogen states and microbial metabolites on BGM interactions in female IBS patients
with IBS and CC in the luteal phase, and after menopause. Project 2 aims to clearly identify the brainstem
nuclei giving rise to ascending noradrenergic and serotonergic projections to limbic and cortical brain regions,
determine the influence of gut microbial metabolites on these arousal systems and determine differences in
these effects between male and female patients. Project 3 aims to evaluate the biological mechanisms within
the BGM axis that mediate the clinical effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in male and female
IBS patients, and identify possible predictors and mediators of outcome.The information garnered from this
study could reveal novel insight into the involvement of different levels of the brain gut microbiome axis in IBS
pathophysiology, and provide a powerful clinical tool for identifying the most effective therapeutic strategies for
women and men with functional GI disorders."
10868504,"OVERALL PROGRAM SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In this P01 proposal entitled: “Novel Approaches to Understand the Pathogenesis and Treat Alzheimer’s
Disease”, we seek to gain a better understanding of the heterogeneous pathogenesis of AD and how it is
influenced by apolipoprotein (apo) E isotypes. The apoE4 allele is the major genetic risk factor for late-onset
AD and has been strongly associated with increased amyloid plaques deposition in brain parenchyma and
advanced vascular amyloid pathology; as well as, enhanced Aβ oligomerization. ApoE is also involved in
synaptic plasticity, glucose metabolism, mitochondrial function, and vascular integrity. Currently, there is no
consensus on how different apoE genotypes contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. The interrelated studies
proposed in the three projects of this P01 will help elucidate this complex role of apoE in AD. Hence this P01 is
addressing an issue of great significance. We propose an integrated, multidisciplinary research endeavor that
brings together investigators with an extensive history of successful collaboration, who have expertise in
diverse areas including proteomics, bioinformatics, neuropathology, AD mouse models, immunology, µMRI,
µPET, medicinal chemistry and biomarker studies. Across all projects we will apply our innovative proteomic
methods (with the assistance of the proteomics/neuropathology Core B) and use of common AD models and
behavioral assessments (with the assistance of the transgenic/behavioral Core C), along with state-of-the-art
biomarker technology using SIMOA and P01 investigator developed µMRI methodologies, to ensure synergism
across all P01 studies. Scientific rigor of the P01 will be ensure by the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core
(Core D). The three projects of this P01 are focused on the differential role apolipoprotein E (apoE) isoforms
play in: 1) AD plaque and vessel amyloid development as assessed by unbiased proteomics across the full
spectrum of AD pathology (Project 1); 2) innovative therapeutic approaches that target the Aβ/apoE interaction
(Project 2); and 3) responses to our novel therapeutic immunomodulation that targets abnormal conformation
(Project 3). Combined our efforts are anticipated to enhance our understanding of the differential effects of
apoE isotypes on AD pathogenesis and accelerate the discovery of effective therapeutic approaches that
address these diverse roles."
10213836,"Background. The suicide rate among women Veterans has increased substantially in recent years,
particularly among younger women and those with limited or no engagement in Veterans Health Administration
(VHA) care. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has invested extensive resources toward preventing
suicide among Veterans, including through the Veterans Crisis Line (VCL). Prior research on Veteran suicide
prevention and VCL use has focused largely on male Veterans. However, research has identified potentially
unique characteristics associated with suicide risk among women Veterans and a need for further investigation
into how to best meet the suicide prevention needs of this population.
Significance/Impact. The objective of this research is to understand and develop recommendations to better
address the suicide prevention needs of women Veterans who utilize the Veterans Crisis Line (VCL). Findings
from this study will inform recommendations for strengthening crisis intervention services to prevent suicide
among women Veterans.
Innovation. The proposed multi-method study will focus on the understudied and vulnerable population of
women Veterans who contact the VCL. We will analyze the rich yet largely unexamined data collected by the
VCL on user and call characteristics, merge VCL data with VHA medical record data for callers who also
access VHA services, and conduct in-depth interviews with women Veteran VCL users to obtain more detailed
understanding of their experiences and perspectives. Findings will inform efforts to better tailor VCL services
to, and increase engagement of, high-risk women Veterans.
Specific Aims. The specific aims are to: (1) describe and compare the demographic and VCL contact
characteristics (reason for call, call outcome, and VCL risk rating) among female and male Veteran VCL users;
(2) examine the relationship between VCL contact characteristics (risk rating, referral, identified needs) and
subsequent fatal and non-fatal suicidal self-directed violence (S-SDV), assessing for variation by Veteran
gender, among female and male Veteran VCL users who use VHA services; (3) understand women Veterans’
experiences with and recommendations regarding VCL services, including the use of VCL as a resource for
both acute and more upstream suicide prevention.
Methodology. This mixed-methods study will utilize (a) administrative data from the VCL, VHA, and Suicide
Data Repository (SDR); and (b) semi-structured interviews with women Veterans who have utilized the VCL.
To address Aim 1, we will conduct statistical analysis of VCL data for prior-year Veteran users with identified
gender (approximately 330,000 contacts per year), comparing demographic and VCL contact characteristics
(reason for contact, severity rating, and contact resolution/referral) by gender. For Aim 2, we will merge VCL
data with VHA health records and SDR data to assess relationships between VCL risk rating and suicidal
ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide, with consideration of other health and service utilization characteristics.
For Aim 3, we will conduct semi-structured telephone interviews with a sample (n = 40) of women Veteran VHA
patients who have used the VCL, and assess: their reasons for contacting the VCL, expectations of VCL,
experience with VCL service and connection with follow-up services, and recommendations for improvements
in suicide prevention services. We will integrate our findings with input from a study-specific stakeholder
advisory board composed of Veterans and clinical and operations partners, to develop recommendations for
enhancing VA’s crisis intervention and broader suicide prevention efforts for women Veterans.
Implementation/Next Steps. In collaboration with partners and Veteran stakeholders, findings will be used to
develop a set of recommendations for clinical enhancement that operations partners can then implement into
policy and practice. Future research will examine the impact of these clinical innovations."
11081925,"Abstract
The complex nature of the subjective experience of pain and lack of effective treatments for chronic pain has
led to the ongoing “opioid epidemic” (CITE). Converging lines of evidence suggest that the ongoing chronic
pain and opioid crisis will be addressed by discovering novel, multimodal therapeutic approaches employing a
solid research network to promote and conduct high quality, efficient clinical trials. In this proposal, we outline
a Hub-spoke complex (California Clinical and Translational Pain Research Consortium (CCTPRC))
consisting of four University of California academic medical centers. These centers have considerable
experience in pain management clinical trials, phenotyping and biomarker validation. Our network will leverage
solid existing CTSA resources to make clinical trial execution efficient and rapid. The Hub will be located at the
University of California San Diego with spokes located on the other three campuses to provide maximum
flexibility, ready to accommodate studies in a variety of pain conditions and provide successful recruitment and
high-quality data collection."
10852870,"OVERALL ABSTRACT
The common occurrence, marked debilitation and subsequent lethality of prostate cancer (PCa)
skeletal metastases has made it a major health concern. In the first fourteen years of this
program, we have addressed this important issue, resulting in a major impact on the field of
skeletal metastasis research, including promoting concepts such as crosstalk between tumor
and bone and the importance of therapeutically targeting the microenvironment, in addition to
tumor. This program has resulted in over 220-grant-related publications and set groundwork for
several clinical trials. In the current competitive renewal, we further attack this problem by
combining leading expertise in PCa research and bone biology. The central theme of this
Program is that there is crosstalk between PCa cells and the bone microenvironment that
fosters the development and progression of PCa metastasis. This crosstalk promotes the ability
of PCa cells to alter the bone microenvironment and render it fertile for tumor growth and
chemotherapeutic resistance. To expand on this theme the Program encompasses closely
interrelated hypotheses of four scientific projects supported by three cores. Project 1 explores
the novel finding that chemotherapy induces fusion of PCa cells to form multinuclear polyploid
giant cancer cells (PGCCs) that confer chemoresistance in the bone microenvironment; Project
2 examines the exciting idea that abscisic acid (ABA) induces PCa cells to adopt a phenotype
capable of existing in a dormant and chemoresistant state, with the capacity for long-term
survival and potential to develop into overt bone metastases; Project 3 explores the surprising
role that osteocytes (OCys) play in promoting PCa bone metastasis through activation of a
novel growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF15) receptor, GDFN family receptor alpha-like
precursor (GFRAL), that subsequently promotes PCa metastatic invasion and growth; Project 4
investigates the novel hypothesis that macrophage efferocytosis (engulfment) of apoptotic PCa
cells induces immunosuppressive signaling in the bone microenvironment that subsequently
enhances metastatic growth. These projects will be supported by three integral cores: Core A
(Administration) that will coordinate reporting, evaluation of progress, advisory board activities,
facilitate interactions among the projects and provide biostatistical support; Core B (Animal) will
provide mouse models and imaging and assistance with their use and Core C (Bone) will
provide expertise with bone histology processing, interpretation, and procurement of human
blood and bone marrow samples. This combination of investigators, projects and cores
provides a highly synergistic Program that is greater than the sum of its parts and will continue
to provide cutting-edge research and leadership in the field of PCa skeletal metastases."
10242628,"The primary goal of the proposed study is to conduct a longitudinal, multimodal assessment of Veteran
sleep and suicide during the period following psychiatric hospitalization. Veterans and military personnel
account for 18% of all known suicides in the United States, with 20 Veterans dying each day of suicide and 900
attempting suicide monthly. While multiple risk factors have been implicated in suicide behavior, insufficient
sleep is consistently associated with elevated suicide risk. Since sleep difficulties often drive Veterans into
treatment, sleep problems may be an optimal target for suicide prevention. Unfortunately the exact link
between inadequate sleep and suicide risk is unclear and research is mixed regarding which specific types of
sleep problems are associated with suicide and which mechanisms are driving the sleep-suicide link.
 The goal of this study is to examine the link between sleep and suicide ideation and related behaviors
in a sample of high risk Veterans. One hundred and forty Veterans will be recruited during inpatient
hospitalization and followed over 6 months following hospital discharge. Sleep and suicide will be assessed
using a combination of actigraphy and Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). EMA will assess
mechanisms hypothesized to drive the relationship between sleep and suicide including emotional reactivity
and impulsivity. EMA devices will be able to capture daily changes in the hypothesized mechanisms, sleep
parameters, and suicide thoughts and behaviors. The primary objective will be to examine how sleep impacts
suicidal ideation and behavior and to determine which specific sleep parameters influence suicide thoughts
and behaviors."

10472511,"Background: VA implemented the Life Sustaining Treatment Decisions Initiative (LSTDI) to elicit, document,
and honor the values, goals, and preferences of Veterans with serious illness. The National Academy of
Medicine recommends, and patients and families prefer goals of care conversations (the foundation of the
LSTDI) occur when they are not acutely ill in the outpatient setting. However, across VA nationally, most goals
of care conversations occur in the inpatient setting close to death; only 39% occur in the outpatient setting.
Significance/Impact: This study will identify strategies to improve LSTDI implementation in the outpatient
setting. This is significant to Veterans because it ensures they can express their goals and preferences for life
sustaining treatments and have them honored. Two VA Secretary priorities are addressed: (1) the goal to
provide “clear information to make informed decisions” about life-sustaining treatments, and (2) the goal for
Veterans to receive “care and support… that emphasizes their well-being and independence throughout their
life journey.” This proposal addresses the R&D goal to increase real-world impact of VA research by
understanding how to improve implementation of a national VA policy. Alignment with HSR&D priorities is
described in the proposal.
Innovation: The proposal uses an innovative study design, a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial
(SMART). The combination of patient-facing and provider-facing implementation strategies, deemed important
in our preliminary studies, is also innovative. Finally, we take a population-based approach to understand the
implementation of goals of care conversations in seriously ill Veterans with serious non-cancer illnesses
including heart failure and chronic pulmonary, renal, and kidney diseases.
Specific Aims. Aim 1. Use a clinician-level SMART in three VA health systems to determine the effectiveness
of clinician and patient implementation strategies to improve the occurrence of documented goals of care
conversations in Veterans with serious medical illness. Aim 2a. Identify the sequence of implementation
strategies that leads to the overall greatest increase in documentation of goals of care conversations. Aim 2b
(exploratory). Identify patient and clinician characteristics that modify the effect of sequences of implementation
strategies on documentation of goals of care conversations. Aim 3. Understand clinician and patient
implementation strategy success or failure using a mixed method evaluation involving clinicians, leaders,
patients, and caregivers.
Methodology: Study sites include the VA Eastern Colorado, Greater Los Angeles, and Palo Alto Health Care
Systems. We will target clinicians with low rates of goals of care conversations among Veterans with medical
illness in the top 10th percentile of risk of hospitalization or death. We will first test less resource intensive
strategies, and subsequently randomize PACT teams with continued low rates of conversations to either an
increased intensity of the current strategy or more time with the current strategy. Data will be collected from
the VA Corporate Data Warehouse (Aims 1 and 2) and patient, caregiver, and clinician interviews or surveys
(Aims 2 and 3). Data will be analyzed using qualitative and quantitative methods.
Next Steps/Implementation: Study findings will be disseminated in collaboration with our operations partners
(National Center for Ethics in Health Care, Primary Care, Palliative Care). Our partners can implement policies
based on study findings to increase early, outpatient implementation of the LSTDI."
10379094,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has had cascading impacts for families and
communities. Concerns have been raised for potential negative physical and mental health
consequences due to the immediate risk of COVID-19 and the secondary social and economic
effects. Family caregivers may be especially vulnerable to short- and long-term impacts.
• Significance/Impact: Informal caregivers provide the majority of home and community-based
long-term care. A majority of functionally impaired Veterans rely on informal care for daily
support and condition management. Negative impacts from the pandemic have the potential to
reduce the capacity of informal caregivers to support Veterans choosing to remain at home.
• Innovation: There are no known studies of how the pandemic has impacted Veteran
caregivers. This study provides a unique opportunity to learn about an essential ally in the care
of Veterans, and the ways in which the VA system can enhance their support for Veterans
experiencing functional and clinical impairment. We uniquely combine an ecological systems
framework and the concept of “cascading effects” from disaster research to help us frame and
understand the different complex short- and long-term effects caregivers may experience.
• Specific Aims:
Aim 1. To describe both positive and negative caregiver experiences during the COVID-19
pandemic and to identify threats to long-term caregiver resiliency. We will conduct surveys with
Veteran caregivers from each of our 5 sites (San Antonio, Palo Alto, Miami, Salt Lake City,
Durham), to describe variability of impacts and to purposively sample caregivers for in-depth,
semi-structured interviews. We will triangulate findings from interviews with local VA caregiver
stakeholders.
Aim 2. To feedback preliminary data and debrief with VISN and national level VA stakeholders
to understand how these issues are perceived and responded to at a regional and national
level, and their priorities for caregiver services and research.
Aim 3. To engage Veteran caregivers in a participatory, deliberative process to identify top
priorities for future research and intervention.
• Methodology: We will conduct a 15-month, multi-sited, mixed methods study, utilizing a brief
Veteran caregiver survey, semi-structured interviews with caregivers and VA stakeholders, and
virtual focus groups with caregivers. We will focus on how caregivers have been impacted and
responded, VA organizational responses, and identifying priority areas for future research and
intervention.
Implementation/Next Steps: This pilot is a first step toward developing a long term
understanding of how Veteran caregivers and their capacity for caregiving have been and will
be impacted by the pandemic. It is an entry point for developing more tailored and sensitive
(e.g., to inequities) VA Veteran caregiver system supports. Our design includes feedback loops
to VA stakeholders and partners so that our findings may be actionable and inform ongoing
research and caregiver-centered, operations work."
10698181,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This U19 application, referred to as SWAN-Aging, is designed to determine the extent to which midlife health,
and specifically the menopause transition (MT), affects successful aging in women. This proposal capitalizes
on the rich resources of the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN), a longitudinal cohort study
initiated in 1994 to characterize the physiological and psychosocial changes that occur during the MT. A total
of 3302 Black, Chinese, Japanese, Hispanic and White women were enrolled at seven sites, with 74% of still-
living women completing up to 16 visits spanning the pre-menopause to post-menopause. SWAN has
described the natural history of the MT -- its timing, patterns of hormonal changes, and symptoms – and their
relation to midlife health indicators. In SWAN-Aging, we will extend follow-up of the SWAN cohort into early old
age (66-75 years) and will prospectively link comprehensive longitudinal characterization of both the MT and
midlife health indicators to functioning and health across multiple domains in early old age, a pivotal time of
transition into old age when adverse changes in health and functioning begin to accumulate. The global
specific aims of this U19 application are to: 1) determine the impact of MT characteristics and trajectories of
midlife health indicators on the preservation of cognitive, physical, genitourinary, sexual, and psychosocial
function and sleep in early old age; 2) determine the impact of MT characteristics and trajectories of midlife
health indicators on risk of adverse health outcomes, including falls, osteoporosis and fractures, poor
cardiometabolic function, cardiovascular events and early mortality; 3) determine if racial/ethnic disparities in
health and functioning in early old age are attributable to midlife racial/ethnic differences in MT characteristics
and midlife health indicators; and 4) translate the SWAN and SWAN-Aging findings for women and their health
care providers. These aims will be achieved through three integrated scientific Projects that are organized
around key health domains (functioning, cardiometabolic health and musculoskeletal health) and linked by a
common focus on MT characteristics and midlife changes in health indicators as key exposures. The three
Projects will be supported by three Cores which will a) provide the necessary organizational infrastructure to
conduct this study and to disseminate results to the research and medical communities; b) conduct accurate,
high volume assays, adopting new methods as needed to provide state-of-the-art laboratory data, and c)
oversee the design and conduct of the core clinic visit, data collection and data management, and the creation
of the analytic datasets. SWAN-Aging will include one clinic visit and a National Death Index search to ensure
complete mortality ascertainment for the cohort. SWAN-Aging is uniquely positioned to fill important scientific
gaps in understanding of the impact of the MT and midlife indicators on women's health and functioning in
early old age and to facilitate the application of new knowledge to clinical practice. This study will provide
valuable insights into modifiable factors relevant to the design of future prevention and treatment programs."
10308667,"ABSTRACT
The polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is recurrently disrupted in brain cancer; a complex required for
depositing the repressive histone modification, H3K27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3). Maintenance of PRC2
function is important for repression of genes and repetitive elements, providing a safe-guard against aberrant
transcription. PRC2 is essential for proper embryonic cell maintenance, neural stem cell differentiation, and
overall brain development. How PRC2 dysfunction and aberrant H3K27me3 levels contributes to brain
tumorigenesis is unclear. As a model of PRC2 dysfunction in brain tumors, our lab investigates midline high
grade gliomas (HGG) that harbor frequent histone H3 lysine 27 to methionine mutations (denoted H3K27M).
Expression of H3K27M impairs PRC2 function and results in a global loss of H3K27me3; a defining feature of
these brain tumors. Using isogenic glioma models in which H3K27M is deleted, we found that the H3K27M
results in a global increase in a mark of active transcription, H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) (Krug et al., Cancer
Cell, 2019). Surprisingly, global H3K27ac has minimal effects on gene transcription. Instead, we discovered a
novel mechanism of H3K27ac associated transcription of repetitive DNA elements, namely Type-H human
endogenous retroviral (HERV) sequences. We hypothesize that: 1) HERV activation plays a functional role in
the biology of H3K27M-driven glioma, and 2) Amplification of HERV expression represents a novel anti-cancer
strategy against tumors with global loss of H3K27me3. To test this hypothesis we propose three specific aims
to: 1) Decipher the mechanisms of HERV transcriptional activation in H3K27M-driven glioma, 2) Determine the
impact of HERV expression on H3K27M-glioma cell identity and tumor formation, and 3) Delineate the
mechanisms of HERV detection and response in H3K27M-glioma. Collectively these experiments will reveal
mechanistic insight into the role of HERV expression in high-grade glioma and cellular vulnerabilities created by
H3K27M mutations."

The concurrent public health crises of opioid misuse with associated overdose death epidemic and inadequate options for pain management require innovative, far-reaching, safe and effective solutions. The Help End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative's Early Phase Pain Investigation Clinical Network (EPPIC-Net) is a unique opportunity to impact the management of pain, through expeditious discovery and validation of biomarkers and analgesic therapies, and in-depth phenotyping. The University of Washington's (UW) Division of Pain Medicine (UW Pain) is well poised to become a Specialized Clinical Center within EPPIC-Net, representing the Pacific Northwest region and beyond. UW Pain (""hub"") includes four core clinical sites: UW Medical Center, Harborview Medical Center, Seattle Children's Hospital, and Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. The hub will be driven by an experienced core team to leverage existing infrastructure and resources and has identified a flexible, diverse, and robust network of spoke sites to meet the broad needs of EPPIC-Net. Our team of principal investigators has extensive relevant experience in conducting multi-site clinical trials across all phases and in deep phenotyping, such as behavioral and psychological profiling, quantitative sensory testing, neuroimaging, and biomarker research. Our Co-Investigators are scientists with experience in clinical trial conduct and multidimensional phenotyping across varied clinical populations. A diverse interprofessional team of seasoned clinical researchers will serve on our Advisory Board to strategize efforts to optimize our hub and spoke network, while Clinical Site Chiefs will facilitate access to patient at their respective clinical site. The team will be further supported by research coordinators and will work closely with UW's Institute for Translational Health Sciences (ITHS), the site of UW's Clinical and Translational Science Award. Relevant UW departments will afford access to disease-specific expertise and patient populations, Committed spokes include specialty care clinics, primary care clinics, external academic medical centers and health systems. Our network spans multiple states and specialties, allowing access to geographically and demographically diverse (including underrepresented and underserved) patient populations and a broad range of medical and surgical disorders for which pain is a clinically significant component. To achieve the goals of the HEAL initiative's EPPIC-Net, we will: (1) Establish UW EPPIC-Net Hub and Spokes infrastructure, provide scientific leadership and administrative oversight, and apply our expertise in design and conduct of high-quality multidisciplinary Phase 2 clinical trials and biomarker validation studies; (2) Develop policies and procedures for rapid design, initiation, recruitment, conduct, and closure of high quality multidisciplinary Phase 2 clinical trials and biomarker validation studies for specific pain conditions at UW Pain EPPIC-Net Hub and Spokes, and; (3) Establish mechanisms for communication, education and training, and performance assessment of the UW-EPPIC-Net Hub and Spokes, to assure efficient and timely utilization of resources to most effectively recruit."
10237114,"Background: A growing number of Veterans are presenting to the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) for the
treatment of Bipolar disorder (BP) and co-occurring substance use disorders (SUDs), with prevalence of SUDs
in patients with BP up to 60%. This comorbidity is associated with increased symptom severity, poorer treatment
outcomes, and greater use of costly health services such as psychiatric hospitalization. Significance/Impact:
Veterans who transition from psychiatric hospitalization to outpatient care are at heightened risk for treatment
nonadherence, mood/substance relapse, deaths due to opioid overdose, and suicide. Nonadherence to
treatment is a significant problem among patients with BP, which is further magnified among those with SUDs.
Nonadherence leads to increased need for psychiatric readmission, with BP patients recently discharged from
inpatient care particularly likely to discontinue pharmacotherapy, relapse to substances, and attempt suicide. Of
particular concern are disproportionately greater rates of suicide in Veterans with BP relative to those with other
mental health conditions. Veterans with BP who use substances, particularly alcohol and opioids, have the
highest suicidality and mortality rates. To date, there is little research on effective and feasible behavioral
aftercare interventions designed to improve treatment adherence in this high-risk, comorbid population at the
critical period following hospital discharge. Innovation: Empirical work suggests that the “Integrated Treatment
Adherence Program” (ITAP) may be an ideal therapeutic approach to improve treatment adherence and clinical
outcomes in Veterans at the critical period of transition to outpatient care following hospitalization. ITAP is an
innovative psychosocial intervention developed by our team designed to improve treatment adherence and
reduce suicidality, bipolar symptoms, and substance abuse among high-risk patients, addressing HSR&D major
research priorities. ITAP combines in-person engagement sessions with follow-up phone contacts and significant
other involvement as an adjunct to treatment as usual over 6 months post-hospitalization. Methodology: The
proposed Hybrid Type 1 Effectiveness-Implementation Trial will evaluate the effectiveness of ITAP in a sample
of 140 Veterans with BP-SUD, randomized to receive either the ITAP intervention or a Safety Assessment and
Follow-up Evaluation (SAFE) comparison condition, both delivered as adjuncts to VHA treatment as usual.
Veterans will be recruited from the Providence VAMC inpatient psychiatric unit and assessed at baseline and at
3 (mid-treatment), 6 (post-treatment), and 9-month follow-up. The Primary Aim is to test the hypotheses that
participants randomized to receive ITAP, relative to SAFE, will evidence improved treatment outcomes at post-
treatment, maintained through follow-up. Primary outcomes are: 1) greater treatment adherence defined by (a)
percent missed medications doses/month (based on electronic monitoring) and (b) percent missed VHA mental
health appointments/month. Secondary outcomes are: (2) reduced suicidality and number of psychiatric
hospitalizations/ER visits; and (3) lower depressive and manic symptoms, lower percentage of alcohol and drug
use days, and improved overall psychosocial functioning. The Secondary Aims are to identify the mechanisms
of action targeted by ITAP, moderators of treatment effects, and perceptions of key stakeholders and contextual
factors that may reduce barriers and increase organizational readiness for implementation of ITAP in the VHA.
Next Steps/Implementation: If shown effective and in cooperation with our operational partners, the next steps
for ITAP would be to conduct a Hybrid Type 3 Implementation Trial to test specific implementation strategies
within a multi-site study and to develop an implementation blueprint for ITAP-based standard of care within the
VHA. Determining whether ITAP is an effective adjunctive treatment directly addresses the need for improved
adherence to evidence-based mental health and substance use treatments and the need for effective suicide
prevention interventions in Veterans. Should ITAP prove effective, we will work with our operational partners to
prioritize ITAP’s ultimate dissemination and implementation within VHA."
10767887,"SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Health concerns of aging—especially cognitive decline and memory loss in older age—have huge public health
implications as the United States and world populations are shifting in distribution toward older ages. While a
variety of toxicants contribute to cognitive aging, we are focused on heavy metals (Pb, As, Mn, Cd, Cr, and Se)
and metal mixtures because, despite years of regulation, clean-up, and remediation efforts, metal
contamination in many Superfund sites persists and continues to threaten public health. To our knowledge,
there is no current Superfund Research Center (SRC) that specifically addresses the health effects, risk, and
remediation of metal contaminants in relation to their effects on cognitive health in older age. To fill this critical
gap and to address the pressing public health problems posed by environmental metal contaminants on
cognitive aging, we propose a new SRC entitled Metals and Metal Mixtures: Cognitive Aging, Remediation and
Exposure Sources (MEMCARE). The overall goal of MEMCARE-SRC is to understand and mitigate effects of
exposure to metals and metal mixtures on late-life cognitive health. To achieve this goal, we have designed a
highly integrated, solution-based program of 4 Research Projects and 4 Cores. Project 1 uses an innovative
approach to assess early-life exposures and late-life cognitive function in a unique population of adults now in
their 60s and 70s who donated baby teeth as children. Project 2 investigates basic biological mechanisms
underlying effects of early-life exposures using both in vitro and in vivo approaches. Project 3 examines the
role of surface and groundwater treatment systems in spatial and temporal patterns of metals in water across
the US, including Superfund sites. Project 4 will develop novel nanostructured adsorbents to remove metals
from water, potentially providing improved remedies for our populations in Project 1 and the Community
Engagement Core (CEC). Our CEC will partner with an urban, industrially-contaminated community in Boston,
MA, and a rural community directly affected by two Superfund sites in Colorado. The Data Management and
Analysis Core (DMAC) will provide data management, biostatistical, and bioinformatics support and ensure
resource sharing and reproducible science for all Projects and Cores. The Administrative Core will provide
oversight and communicate our science to stakeholders. The Research Experience and Training Coordination
Core (RETCC) will embed with all aspects of our Center to provide doctoral and postdoctoral trainees with
relevant experiences in all aspects of work in the SRC."
10400826,"Background: Type 2 Diabetes, a common, complex condition with high comorbidity, affects 24% of Veterans.
Vulnerable Veterans (e.g., African-American, rural, comorbid mental health diagnosis, low-income) are less
likely to have controlled diabetes, and have higher mortality and morbidity compared to other Veterans.
Significance/Impact: Health Care Informatics interventions to support chronic disease self-management
through technology can improve access, health equity, and health outcomes for vulnerable Veterans.
Customizable, interactive self-management support through Annie addresses the VA's priority of improving
access, including via virtual modalities, and providing a tailored experience that incorporates Veteran needs and
preferences (VA Strategic Imperative 2). Research priority areas of access to care, women's health, mental
health, primary care practice, informatics, virtual care, health equity, and patient-centered care are all addressed.
Innovation: By incorporating the needs and preferences of vulnerable Veterans with diabetes in a self-
management texting intervention and testing its effectiveness against a more traditional education-only
intervention, lessons learned can improve the development of text-based support for other complex chronic
conditions. It can also improve future implementation of Annie-based self-management support throughout VA.
Specific Aims: AIM 1: Refine and beta test components of an interactive, tailored self-management texting
protocol (DD-TXT) using a participatory design process incorporating vulnerable Veterans' preferences, VA
clinician input, and evidence on effective texting-enabled self-management programs. The DD-TXT protocol will
consist of: Core Messaging: Customizable core modules on medication management, blood sugar and blood
pressure monitoring, preventive care, problem solving, appointment reminders, administrative messages; and
Optional Messaging: A library of patient-selected modules (e.g. nutrition, physical activity, weight management,
emotional coping, goal setting) designed to motivate and educate.
AIM 2: Conduct a randomized controlled comparative effectiveness trial with 400 Veterans whose diabetes
was uncontrolled (defined as HbA1c over 8.0% for at least 50% of the most recent 6 months) in 2018 in
Gainesville, FL or Chicago, IL. The primary aim will be to assess the comparative effectiveness of DD-TXT
compared to DSE, a diabetes skills education-only texting protocol based on a skills workbook that is currently
given to VA patients with diabetes. The primary outcome will be HbA1c percent time in control. Secondary
outcomes include self-reported adherence to diabetes self-care recommendations (SCI-R), diabetes self-
efficacy, diabetes distress, LDL, and blood pressure control. We hypothesize that DD-TXT will result in better
proximal health outcomes and diabetes self-management behaviors vs an education-only protocol (DSE).
AIM 3: Obtain information to guide future implementation of diabetes self-management support through texting
by (a) gathering and analyzing qualitative feedback from patients engaged in the comparative effectiveness
trial, overall and by subgroup (b) collecting qualitative feedback from providers and key stakeholders on the
barriers/facilitators of future RCT evaluation and implementation of DD-TXT vs DSE, (c) conducting a cost-
identification analysis and safety analysis to identify resources required for larger-scale implementation.
Methodology: We will refine the DD-TXT protocol through a participatory design process, conduct a
randomized controlled comparative effectiveness trial with 400 Veterans with uncontrolled diabetes, and collect
qualitative feedback from patients, providers, and other stakeholders and conduct a cost-identification analysis
to guide future implementation.
Next Steps/Implementation: This project will inform future processes for incorporating Veteran input into
Annie protocol development and lead to a future Type 2 hybrid implementation trial of DD-TXT or DSE (based
on our findings) to determine best implementation strategies for Annie-based self-management support."
10771166,"The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Superfund Research Program (UAB-SRP) will address
environmental airborne pollution with heavy metals, and its impact on respiratory health and environmental
degradation. The 35th Avenue, North Birmingham superfund site has been proposed by the EPA to be put on
the national priorities list. It is located in the heart of downtown Birmingham, Alabama. The Contaminants of
Potential Concern, identified by the EPA include cadmium, arsenic and manganese which will be studied in the
UAB-SRP. The site is home to nearly 20,000 people and is in close proximity to coke furnaces, steel mills and
other industry. The population is predominantly African American; who recall their recent civil rights struggles in
Birmingham, AL and request environmental equity as well as answers to their concerns about their respiratory
health. The prevalence of chronic lung diseases such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD),
Asthma in children and Lower Respiratory Tract Infections (LRTI) is significantly higher in the Affected Area
compared to the neighboring Control Area irrespective of smoking, socioeconomic status or demographics. The
EPA is in the process of remediating the area, removing soil form several homes since they are recognized to
have high arsenic levels. The UAB SRP consists of three biomedical projects and two environmental/
engineering projects that will focus on both human lung health and the health of the environment. All biomedical
projects involve direct study of subjects from the Affected Area with a focus on COPD, Asthma and LRTI. The
environmental projects include the development and use of an “optical nose” to measure toxicants in the field.
Remediation by the use of Nano-Micro hybrid fibrous material for contaminant removal will be studied.
Transparent, bidirectional communication with the community is fostered through the community engagement
and Administrative/Research Translation cores. This innovative, problem based, solution oriented UAB-SRP will
provide a deeper understanding of the health of the environment and directly impact the lung health of the
residents of Birmingham, Alabama."
10832982,"This proposal seeks to continue the development of the regional Einstein-Mount Sinai Diabetes Research
Center (ES-DRC) to support the discovery, application and translation of scientific knowledge for the treatment
and cure of diabetes. Building upon our highly collaborative and successful transdisciplinary interactions
among Einstein and Mount Sinai and other regional investigators, the ES-DRC will serve as a New York
regional nexus to i) enhance diabetes research, education and training; ii) attract, mentor and retain research
investigators; iii) provide state-of-the-art Biomedical Research Core services to maximize research productivity;
iv) foster collaborations locally and regionally, and v) promote the translation of scientific findings from the
bench to the bedside. To accomplish these goals, we have reorganized the ES-DRC with five cutting-edge
cores spanning the basic, pre-clinical, and clinical research ‘translational’ divide: 1) Animal Physiology Core; 2)
Stable Isotope & Metabolomics Core; 3) Human Islet & Adenovirus Core; 4) Immuno-Technology Core; and 5)
Translational Research Core. These Biomedical Research Cores support our larger and collaborative research
base across multiple institutions. For studies directed at the molecular, cellular, tissue, animal based integrated
physiology levels we provide the infrastructure to investigate the basic mechanisms of type 1 and type 2
diabetes. We have also organized a framework by which basic and animal model pre-clinical studies can be
translated into human-based clinical investigation.
 To attain these goals, the Administrative Core manages integration and promotion of research and training
among Einstein, Mount Sinai and other affiliated institutional faculty. The Administrative Core also provides
support for our highly successful Pilot & Feasibility Study Program and coordination with the Einstein and
Mount Sinai Clinical Translational Science Awards (CTSA). This infrastructure has also allowed us to maintain
a strong Enrichment program, promote diabetes research and advocacy, and support our philanthropic efforts,
all pivotal for our ongoing faculty recruitment efforts, and management and development of new initiatives. The
five Biomedical Cores provide robust cutting-edge experimental and data interpretative services directly in-line
with the specific support needs of our highly successful, productive and extramurally funded research base.
The Pilot & Feasibility Program continues to draw new young investigators that develop into exceptional
independent senior research investigators. The ES-DRC has created and maintains a robust academic
environment for our recruitment of new and established investigators into diabetes and metabolism research.
Lastly, the cross-institutional support and regional coordination of diabetes efforts are a direct result of the ES-
DRC leadership teams."
10248294,"Background: Chronic insomnia, one of the most common health problems among Veterans, significantly
impacts health, function, and quality of life. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBTI) is the first line
treatment; however, despite efforts to train hundreds of VA clinicians to deliver CBTI, there are still significant
barriers to providing adequate access to insomnia care. Up to 44% of Veterans seen in Primary Care report
insomnia, making it an optimal clinical setting for improving access to insomnia care. Furthermore, Brief
Behavioral Treatment for Insomnia (BBTI), adapted from CBTI as a briefer, more flexible treatment, is easily
delivered by Primary Care Mental Health Integration (PCMHI) clinicians and can greatly improve access to
care for Veterans with insomnia. Yet, simply training PCMHI clinicians to deliver BBTI is not enough.
Implementation strategies are needed for successful uptake, adoption, and sustainable delivery of care.
Significance/Impact: BBTI is effective, developed for non-specialty care settings, and easier to deliver than
CBTI. If delivered sustainably within Primary Care, BBTI can help increase access to evidence-based insomnia
care and overcome barriers related to accessing CBTI. The proposed study has potential to significantly
impact, and improve, how insomnia care is delivered in VA. It is responsive to VA ORD priorities of expanding
access to high quality clinical trials and increasing the real-world impact of VA research. Also, it targets
HSR&D research, and ORD clinical, priority areas (access to care, mental health, primary care practice, virtual
care/telehealth) using a cross-cutting health services research methodology, implementation science.
Innovativeness: The study design is rigorous, pragmatic, and features innovative methods, notably a stepped-
wedge, hybrid implementation-effectiveness design. This study is unique—a search of VA ORD and NIH
funded studies found there are no studies testing implementation strategies to improve the delivery of BBTI in
Primary Care. Focusing on implementation outcomes and treatment effectiveness will help produce results that
can improve access to care for a prevalent disorder and more rapidly translate results into practice and policy.
Specific Aims: Aim 1 will compare the impact of PCMHI clinicians trained to deliver BBTI vs. the impact of
BBTI training plus 12-months of access to an implementation strategy bundle (BBTI+IS). BBTI+IS vs. BBTI
training alone is expected to result in more Veterans with access to insomnia care in the Primary Care setting.
Aim 2 will identify specific strategies that promote successful implementation of BBTI in PCMHI through the
use of qualitative interviews and surveys with clinical stakeholders at each study site.
Methodology: This stepped-wedge, hybrid III implementation-effectiveness trial involves four VA Medical
Centers/Health Care Systems: Baltimore, Durham, Minneapolis, and Philadelphia. The stepped-wedge design
allows for fewer sites to achieve adequate power as all sites are exposed to BBTI training and BBTI+IS. The
hybrid design allows for testing of implementation and treatment effectiveness, guided by the Reach,
Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. The target sample are
PCMHI clinicians and the impact of a bundle of strategies on the success of sustainably delivering BBTI in
Primary Care. Retrospective data collected from VA electronic health records will be used to obtain variables of
interest related to Veteran treatment outcomes and data related to how PCMHI clinicians deliver BBTI.
Implementation/Next Steps: Findings will be used to better understand specific implementation strategies
that can help increase uptake and sustainable delivery of BBTI in PCMHI through research and quality
improvement efforts on a larger scale. Through collaborations with operations partners in the Office of Mental
Health and Suicide Prevention, the study team will work towards the development of products to educate VA
stakeholders (local, VISN, VACO) and methods to widely disseminate BBTI training for PCMHI clinicians,
efforts that will further contribute towards the improvement of insomnia care and Veteran health overall."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The University of Colorado Denver (UC Denver) is world renowned for basic, translational, and clinical diabetes
research and treatment of both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes (T1D and T2D), and their related complications. The
proposed University of Colorado Diabetes Research Center (UC Denver DRC) will strengthen diabetes research
in Colorado by providing: 1) state-of-the-art research technologies and specialized resources to maximize
effective and innovative research; 2) access to patient samples and data; 3) enrichment programs, education
and seminar series to the diabetes community; and 4) by attracting new scientists into the diabetes field through
the Pilot and Feasibility program. These objectives will be realized by providing improved infrastructure and
access to specialized reagents and resources, and an environment that promotes scientific interactions, research
discoveries, and progress towards diabetes treatment and cures. The UC Denver DRC will be primarily located
on the rapidly growing Anschutz Medical Campus (AMC) in Aurora, Colorado where the majority of the UC
Denver clinical and research departments are located. This unique multi-hospital and academic campus
configuration allows for a broad diabetes research base, which currently includes 88 basic, translational, and
clinical scientific investigators across 17 departments and divisions at UC AMC who currently bring
diabetes/diabetes-related direct cost grant support totaling > $65 million in individual grants and >$14
million in center and training grants. Drs. Lori Sussel, PhD. and Jane Reusch, MD bring together
complementary areas of scientific backgrounds and expertise to oversee the organization and scientific focus of
the UC Denver DRC. We will implement four Biomedical Research Cores to provide cutting-edge technologies
in Clinical Resources (fully integrated databases for tracking of study participants, bio-samples and data),
Tissue Procurement and Processing (rodent tissue and islet isolation, human islet and tissue procurement,
histology services, cell culture bank), Diabetes Modeling (human stem cell-derived in vitro cell and organoid
models, gene editing), and Cell and Tissue Analysis (advanced microscopy, flow cytometry, specialized
CyTOF and MIBI reagents for the diabetes community). The UC Denver DRC will also establish a Pilot and
Feasibility Program to recruit young faculty into diabetes and diabetes-related research, and encourage
established investigators from other fields to enter the diabetes field. The Dean of the UC Denver School of
Medicine has pledged to supplement the P&F budget by $100,000 each year to promote an increased diabetes
research presence on campus. Finally, the UC Denver DRC Enrichment Program will promote the interaction
between diabetes researchers at UC AMC by providing seminar forums for exchange of research findings,
providing opportunities to form collaborative relationships, and encouraging cross-pollination between the
diverse diabetes communities."
10909250,"The overall mission of the UCSD/UCLA DRC centers on supporting research in the prevention and treatment
of diabetes and its complications to ultimately improve the lives of patients. For the past 17 years, our DRC has
been unique in linking together the diabetes/metabolism research activities of two major universities within the
UC system and their affiliated institutions in Southern California. This effort has fostered new collaborations
and interactions between outstanding scientists within and across these institutions. Our research base is
comprised of the following focus areas: Nuclear Receptors, Cell Signaling, Metabolism, Diabetes
Complications, and Islet/Beta Cell Biology. Each of these areas has outstanding leaders who facilitate
interactions and sharing of resources. The DRC has played an important role in promoting the careers of
young scientists as they move on to the status of independent investigators by awarding pilot and feasibility
grants. As an acknowledgement of our success in this effort, UCSD and UCLA have agreed to provide over
$100,000/year in additional unrestricted funds to augment our P&F program. The DRC will continue to advance
scientific and intellectual interactions by organizing and facilitating meetings, lectures, and mentoring efforts
that are part of our Enrichment Program. We will further accelerate diabetes research at the DRC Institutions
by providing state-of-the-art services through five cutting edge cores: A) The Transgenic and Knockout Mouse
Core, B) Metabolic and Molecular Physiology Core, C) Epigenetics and Genomics Core, D) Human Genetics
Core, and E) Targeted Pathway Analysis Core. All of our research cores have been updated with new services
and latest technologies in the upcoming project period to reflect the needs of our faculty, and the many
advances in this field as they relate to diabetes and metabolism research. Our efforts to support the cores and
facilitate collaboration have been successful, as can be judged by the numerous collaborative publications in
high impact journals and the substantial peer review grant support our faculty have accrued. The current
competitive renewal application includes many new scientific and technological advancements, including the
incorporation of novel genomic, proteomic, and metabolomics services that are now available to our members
in a streamlined and seamless fashion. Our future plans include the continued seamless integration of
research at all participating institutions to enhance technology and research capability within the DRC, to
promote the careers of promising young investigators through our successful P&F Program, and to accelerate
translational research activity and collaborations through interactions with the CTSA programs at both
institutions."
10827451,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – CENTER OVERVIEW
This proposal seeks to create and support an interactive regional diabetes research community (184 members)
across four premiere research institutions in North Carolina, who currently garner over $70 million annually for
support of their diabetes research: Duke University (Duke) The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC),
Wake Forest School of Medicine (WF), and North Carolina A&T (NC A&T). The North Carolina Diabetes
Research Center (NCDRC) will support Research Cores that represent unique strengths at each institution.
These Cores will support studies of the current Research Base at each respective institution, but will also be
made available to the other NCDRC institutions, where their use has been hampered by less easy access. An
expanded Pilot and Feasibility Program will encourage use of these now regional Cores, bring to the field new
investigators and young scientists, and draw those not previously working in the field. We will leverage the
existing infrastructure at each institution’s NIH Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) site, to guide
investigators to other resources that enhance their scientific productivity and efficiency. The goal of this new
Center is to create connectivity in the diabetes research community, thereby fostering new advances in basic
and translational diabetes research. We will take advantage of the substantial pre-existing resources and
capabilities at each institution, and connect investigators to resources unique to each campus, to maximize the
ability of member investigators – whether new investigators or scientists new to diabetes research – to answer
important questions across the spectrum of translational approaches. There is a history of collaboration in
diabetes research among the four institutions. Most importantly for this application, however, are the unique
strengths that can be shared among our campuses, and the enormous potential for a large and cohesive
community of investigators to advance diabetes research further. Regional Core Resources to be directly
supported by the NCDRC will include a Genomics and Proteomics Core, and a world-renowned Metabolomics
Core, including not only a range of state-of-the-art analyses but equally importantly, interpretive services that
are often a bottleneck for such resources. Expertise in the Advanced Clinical Sciences Methods Core will be
focused on driving translation of discovery to clinical care of diabetes, emphasizing state-of-the-art methods.
Each Core will offer specialized Research Navigators to guide diabetes-focused investigators. Finally, an
Enrichment Program will plan and sponsor an annual symposium, reaching out to investigators whose work and
techniques could inform diabetes research. Fellows supported on T32 or T35 training programs at Duke, UNC,
and WF, whose work is evolving in a diabetes-relevant direction, will be a special focus for outreach."
11078376,"Pain associated with surgery is experienced by millions of patients every year. Post-surgical
pain usually resolves as the surgical site heals. However, up to half of the patients develop
chronic pain after surgery. Crucially, little is known about the mechanisms that aid in the
resolution of postoperative pain. Moreover, opioids remain the mainstay treatment for post-
surgical pain which are fraught with serious side-effects and crucially - abuse liabilities. The goal
of our research is to validate an endogenous mechanism that leads to the resolution of post-
surgical pain. Metabolism is inextricably linked to every aspect of cellular function. However,
the specific effects surgery has on the metabolism of sensory neurons and how these changes
influence the resolution of post-surgical pain are not known. Hence, we determined that surgical
trauma suppresses pyruvate oxidation while increase glutamine catabolism was associated with
the resolution of post-surgical pain. The selective increase of glutamine oxidation was in part
mediated by the glutamine transporter ASCT2 which replenished the Krebs cycle metabolic
intermediates that have been depleted due to reduced pyruvate oxidation. This process is
known as anaplerosis. Moreover, disruption of ASCT2 expression prevented the resolution of
postoperative pain. Hence, we aim to validate that ASCT2 is critical for the resolution of post-
surgical pain and can be manipulated for the resolution of postoperative pain. Using molecular,
biochemical, metabolic assays and innovative multiband fluorescence imaging method of intact
DRGs, we aim to achieve our objective. Moreover, we propose to validate an innovative RNA-
based strategy that enhances ASCT2 expression. Validation of endogenous targets that resolve
postoperative pain can have broad impact in advancing our knowledge of the transition of acute
pain to chronic and lead to urgently needed public health advancements."

The mission of the Indiana Diabetes Research Center (IDRC) is to foster knowledge, support training, and
promote basic and translational research in diabetes and related metabolic disorders, and their complications.
A major focus of the IDRC has been the training and development of the “next generation” of diabetes
researcher. This focus has involved a state-wide effort led by the IDRC that has included resource provision
(through the Research Cores), financial support and mentoring (through the Pilot and Feasibility Program and
institutional funds), and creation of a collaborative diabetes ecosystem (through the Enrichment Program) for a
burgeoning pool of investigators at Indiana University School of Medicine and its affiliated research institutions
in Indiana (Purdue University, Indiana University-Purdue University in Indianapolis, Indiana University
Bloomington, and the Indiana Biosciences Research Institute). The IDRC has been the catalyst for the growth
of the Diabetes Research Base by 47% since the funding of this award in 2015. The IDRC consists of a
Research Base of 94 highly collaborative investigators who represent 4 research themes: Cellular & Molecular
Metabolism; Complications of Diabetes & Obesity; Islet Function & Survival; Nutrition & Physiology of Diabetes
and Obesity. Collectively, this group of investigators brings in $46.7M in annual directs from the NIH, of which
50% ($23M) is from NIDDK. The research programs of these investigators is be augmented by 5 state-of-the-

 (4) Build and strengthen the diabetes research base, support infrastructure to ensure ongoing growth
and innovation, and engage with the local community to raise diabetes awareness and involvement."
10875702,"ABSTRACT
The concept of the “microbiota-gut-brain axis”, which originated from behavioral studies in microbiome-
reconstituted mice, has advanced to current research that supports the microbiome may be responsible for some
of the most devastating neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Recent studies have
interrogated this connection among the intestinal microbiome and identified significant changes in the abundance
of certain taxa in AD patients. Thus, one current theory is that AD pathogenesis is closely related to the imbalance
of the gut microbiome and may originate in the gut. Our group has recently published findings among a cohort
of nursing home elders demonstrating a dysbiotic pattern in AD elders that is hallmarked by a reduction in the
prevalence of bacteria with anti-inflammatory properties, as well as an acquisition of taxa that are known to cause
pro-inflammatory states. In this proposal we will: 1) leverage our current nursing home experience to enroll elders
assessing cognitive decline; 2) advance our work within the local Senior Centers' elder groups to enroll a
comparative community-dwelling cohort; 3) determine both microbiota taxonomy and gene function among these
elders; 4) utilize stool samples to determine how the microbiome can induced intestinal inflammation and how
this correlates back to observed systemic inflammation; and 5) study the microbiome metabolic product
differences and explain how these products can influence microglia functioning. We hypothesize that there is a
characteristic dysbiotic microbiome among AD elders, regardless of living environment, and that the level of
inflammation-type dysbiosis positively correlates with both local and systemic inflammation and eventually
cognitive decline. We further hypothesize that the AD microbiome metabolites negatively impact microglial
functioning. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will assess characteristics of the AD elder's microbiome from different
environments in comparison to elders without dementia and longitudinally assess the microbiome composition
and correlate it to changes in cognition. In Aim 2 we will determine the extent of microbiome dysbiosis among
AD elders, correlate this with the level of induce (in vivo/vitro) epithelial dysfunction, and then back to elder
cytokine markers of inflammation and T cell population markers of immunosenescence. Finally, in Aim 3 we will
perform metabolomics to identify metabolite profile differences between AD elders and those without dementia
and use the identified metabolites in our in vivo/vitro assays to describe its effects on microglial functioning. This
work takes a critical step forward to bridge microbiome associations with AD to causality by showing how the AD
elder's microbiome dysbiosis observed can adversely affect intestinal epithelial homeostasis leading to systemic
inflammation, inflammation-causing immunosenescence, and ultimately cognitive dysfunction. It will also
describe the microbial metabolic product differences and how these metabolites influence microglial functioning.
Understanding how this crucial “microbiota-gut-brain axis” impacts AD development and progression will provide
novel therapeutic targets and enable future trials aimed at intervening upon these pathways."
10795695,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chronic pain and the addictive effects of opioids used to control pain are major health problems affecting
millions of Americans. Validation of novel targets for the safe treatment of chronic pain is urgently needed. We
identified peptidase inhibitor 16 (PI16) as a novel regulator of chronic pain in an unbiased RNA seq screen.
PI16 is a putative peptidase inhibitor that has not been studied in the context of pain. We showed that male and
female Pi16-/- mice are protected against mechanical allodynia in the spared nerve injury (SNI) and paclitaxel
models of neuropathic pain. Along the neuraxis, PI16 is only detectable in fibroblasts around peripheral nerves
(perineurium), and in the meninges of dorsal root ganglia (DRG), spinal cord, and brain, but not in neurons,
glia or leukocytes. . PI16 levels in perineurial and DRG meningeal fibroblasts increase during neuropathic pain.
The overall objective of this project is to validate PI16 as a novel target for the treatment of chronic pain
using mouse models and human tissues of neuropathy patients and controls and to identify the underlying
mechanisms. Our central hypothesis is that increased PI16 secretion by DRG meningeal and perineurial
fibroblasts promotes chronic pain by increasing blood nerve barrier (BNB) permeability and leukocyte
trafficking into nerve and DRG. The significance is in the validation of PI16 as a novel, potentially
druggable, regulator of chronic pain and the discovery of fibroblasts as key regulators of chronic pain.
We propose the following three specific aims: 1. Validate the key role of PI16 in chronic pain. In two
independent laboratories, we will test the hypothesis that genetic deletion of Pi16 in male and female mice
protects against chronic pain in well-established models of chronic pain. 2. Investigate expression and
regulation of PI16 in fibroblasts around mouse DRG and mouse and human peripheral nerves.
The hypothesis is that PI16 production by fibroblasts in DRG meninges and perineurium is increased via a
TGFβ− and Epac1-mediated pathway to promote chronic pain. We will use tissues from the neuraxis in mouse
pain model and nerves from humans with neuropathic pain. 3. Determine the contribution of PI16 to
blood nerve barrier integrity in mouse pain models and in a human in vitro model. Using a model
of the human BNB, we will test the hypothesis that PI16 increases BNB permeability and leukocyte
transmigration. Using co-immuno-precipitation and mass spectrometry we will identify novel PI16 targets.
This proposal is conceptually innovative because successful completion will validate PI16 as a novel key
regulator of neuropathic and inflammatory pain and establish a novel role of perineurial fibroblasts in
regulating BNB function with major consequences for chronic pain. The expected findings are significant
because they will advance our fundamental understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms that
contribute to chronic pain and will identify a novel target for treatment of pain that is not expressed in the
brain, and therefore is unlikely to lead to addiction."

term goal is to reveal mechanisms of pain/nociceptive signaling and define drug targets. G protein-coupled
receptors (GPCRs) control most patho-physiological processes, including pain, and are the target of 34% of
therapeutic drugs. GPCRs are considered to function solely at the plasma membrane, where they interact with
extracellular ligands and couple to intracellular G proteins. However, agonists released from injured and
diseased tissues evoke redistribution of GPCRs to endosomes in neurons. These endosomal GPCRs
(eGPCRs) generate sustained signals in subcellular compartments that control the ion channel activity that
underlies chronic pain. The central hypothesis is that activation of pronociceptive eGPCRs produces
nociceptive signaling and most forms of chronic pain; antagonists of eGPCRs block nociceptive signaling and
are anti-nociceptive. The rationale for this proposal is that discovery of eGPCR pain mechanisms will facilitate
development of drugs that selectively antagonize eGPCRs in neurons and provide superior pain relief with
fewer side effects. The overall objectives are to discover mechanisms underlying chronic pain and validate a
therapeutic target. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Discover the
mechanisms of eGPCR signaling in subcellular compartments of neurons; biophysical and imaging
approaches will be used; nanoparticles (NPs) will be designed with components that target neurons, promote
endocytosis and release eGPCR ligands in the acidic endosome; 2) Discover the mechanisms by which
eGPCRs regulate ion channels that control neuron activity; ion channel activity and excitability of neurons will
be studied with electrophysiology. NP-encapsulated drug probes will define the role of eGPCRs in neuronal
excitation; 3) Validate eGPCRs as a therapeutic target for chronic inflammatory, neuropathic and cancer pain;
NP-encapsulated eGPCR ligands will be compared to conventional therapy in three pain models. The
proposed pain mechanism is a novel explanation that resolves the enigma of widespread clinical trial failures of
GPCR-targeted drugs. Innovation in the proposal extends to the NP approach to probe the mechanism and
validate the target. The proposal is clinically significant because it validates an eGPCR-target that offers
superior pain relief with fewer side-effects and is applicable to most patients with intractable chronic pain."
11082537,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 A major recent advancement for the field of pain research is the recognition of immune system
dysregulation as a contributor to the most serious adverse consequences of injury. Accumulating data from
clinical and laboratory studies place the activation of B lymphocytes at the center of much of this work,
particularly with respect to chronic pain and disability-related outcomes. Validation of this B cell hypothesis
could lead directly to trials testing the efficacy of novel or existing immunomodulating agents on
posttraumatic pain. Key goals and outcomes of peritraumatic B cell modulation reflected in our experimental
design include enhancing the rate and improving the quality of recovery while reducing chronic pain,
functional loss and neuropsychiatric consequences such as anxiety and cognitive decline. To achieve our
goals a well-validated core mouse model of limb fracture will be employed with additional studies to be
conducted in incisional and nerve injury models to broaden our assessment of B cell mediated effects. Age
and sex will be included as variables to enhance rigor. Often discussed but seldom achieved translation of
the studies to a larger species (dogs) and finally to humans will be achieved in this innovative project.
 In the project's first aim we rigorously address the role of B cell activation and autoantibody formation in
pain, functional and neuropsychiatric outcomes after fracture injury in mice. The tools used directly (anti-
CD20) and indirectly (sympatholysis, anti-IL-6) modulate B cell function to mimic potential therapeutic
approaches. The outcomes selected are highly robust and quantify behavioral, cellular and biochemical
features of recovery from trauma.
 In the second aim we assess the contributions of B cell activation and autoantibody formation on pain,
function and neuropsychiatric outcomes in models of soft tissue injury (incision) and nerve damage
(selective ligation). These experiments will help us define the breadth of B cell effects by examining specific
contributors to trauma-related pain.
 In the project's final aim, we make the critical transition to examination of autoantibody formation in dogs
undergoing tibial surgery and in humans undergoing knee replacement involving two unique collaborations.
Both are common surgeries with substantial rates of persistent pain and disability. Preliminary evidence
suggests that pain-promoting and function-limiting antibodies are formed in 40-50 percent of these cases.
 Chronic pain syndromes after injuries and surgery have substantial functional, neuropsychiatric and
financial consequences. We do not have effective non-addictive therapies to prevent or treat posttraumatic
pain in disease-modifying fashion. If this B lymphocyte target validation effort is successful, the door will be
open to the design of definitive clinical trials using novel or existing immunomodulating tools."
10263632,"Chronic overlapping pain conditions (COPCs) are idiopathic pain conditions that have minimal identifiable
origins in organic disease and represent a highly significant pain management challenge for physician and
patient. They occur in tens of millions of Americans with annual costs exceeding $100 billion. Epidemiological
data indicate many of these conditions overlap in presentation in the same patient, with odds of presenting 2 or
more conditions exceeding 50%. Often spatially separate areas of the body are affected (e.g.,
temporomandibular disorder (TMD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)), which strongly suggests the
involvement of central nervous system mechanisms. Additionally, stress triggers or exacerbates many of these
conditions, which occur more frequently or exclusively in women. The convergence of pain from different
peripheral tissues and perceived stress most likely occurs in the brain. We propose an innovative
multidisciplinary discovery-driven approach to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention to treat these
chronic pain conditions. We will use a recently reported rat model of comorbid pain hypersensitivity: masseter
muscle inflammation followed by stress inducing de novo chronic visceral hypersensitivity, a defining
characteristic of IBS. Combining visceral and orofacial pain measurement in awake animals, functional
magnetic resonance imaging, mass spectrometry imaging of brain sections, and genetic and molecular
approaches will allow identification of specific lipids and their metabolic pathways that change expression in
the brain during the transition from acute to chronic overlapping pain. A longitudinal design will allow changes
in brain activity in individual animals to be followed over weeks to months. In addition, areas of the brain that
contribute to known sex differences in the magnitude and duration of the stress-induced and comorbid
hypersensitivity should be identified. In three specific aims we will: 1) Identify changes in structure/function of
brain regions in response to stress alone and pain plus stress which correlate with changes in visceral
sensitivity and orofacial mechanosensitivity in male and female rats. Further, we will identify lipid moieties and
the underlying metabolic pathways that change between baseline, acute and chronic pain conditions; 2)
determine the effect of genetic knockdown of identified metabolic pathways in rat models of stress-induced and
comorbid pain hypersensitivity. siRNA microinjected into brain regions identified in Aim 1 will be used to
knockdown expression of enzymes that mediate the changes in lipid expression in the rat models. The effects
of siRNA on the sensory and affective components of pain will be examined to help identify “drugable targets”
for therapeutic intervention; and 3) Use pharmacological tools to test identified targets in order to confirm the
clinical utility in reversing these conditions. The proposed studies will significantly advance understanding of
chronic overlapping pain conditions and identify novel treatment targets."
11160833,"Chemotherapy-induced painful peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is the most common toxicity
associated with widely used chemotherapeutics. CIPN is the major cause of dose reduction or
discontinuation of otherwise life-saving treatment. Unfortunately, CIPN can persist in cancer-
survivors which adversely affects their quality of life. Moreover, available treatments are vastly
inadequate which necessitates the development of novel mechanism-based therapies that can
either prevent or treat CIPN. Recently, HIF1A, PDHK1, and LDHA have been demonstrated to be
the key molecular mediators that initiate and maintain bortezomib-induced neuropathic pain.
However, those studies were carried out in tumor-free mice. Moreover, our preliminary results
also implicate those molecular targets in paclitaxel and oxaliplatin-induced neuropathic pain.
Hence, the objective of this proposal is to validate that HIF1A, PDHK1 and LDHA are shared
mediators that lead to the development and maintenance of bortezomib, paclitaxel and oxaliplatin-
induced neuropathic pain in tumor-bearing mice. Using biochemical, metabolic, behavioral and
innovative imaging method of intact DRGs this application aims to systematically validate these
targets for the prevention and treatment of CIPN. Successful completion of this project promises
to lower the risk of adopting these targets in translational projects to develop novel non-addictive
therapeutics for chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain."
10883778,"Improving health care for the medically underserved, including our Hispanic population, afflicted by
prevalent diseases, such as cancer, cardio-metabolic and infectious diseases, remains a major challenge.
The current application is to support the development of Hispanic Alliance for Clinical & Translational Research
in Puerto Rico (Alliance), which aims to build on the existing infrastructure of the Puerto Rico Clinical and
Translational Research Consortia (PR-CTRC an RCMI-CTR) and the unique expertise on emerging infectious
diseases and the study of disaster-related conditions and their impact on Health. The objective of the Alliance
is to serve as the catalytic center to enhance the competitiveness of investigators to conduct research and
obtain additional funding for clinical and translational research addressing highly prevalent diseases and
those that affect the medically underserved in Puerto Rico. The long-term goal of the Alliance is to
transform clinical and translational research in Hispanic populations in the Mainland and in Puerto Rico by
promoting inter-disciplinary collaboration and leverage of resources to address diseases affecting
Hispanic communities.
 Successful implementation of the Alliance will advance our fundamental knowledge of Hispanic health
in this ethnic subgroup, which is increasingly represented in the U.S. mainland population. The Alliance is
innovative because it will: (1) create a Hispanic-centered research hub integrating resources to support
researchers in PR and national partners; (2) implement the Hispanic Real World clinical research data
warehouse; and (3) establish a Community Health & Research Council comprised of diverse community
partners emphasizing a community-centered, bi-directional research focus to impact health policy and
ultimately improving health outcomes in our Hispanic community. The Alliance overall aims are specified
below.
Specific Aim 1: Enhance an island-wide infrastructure and human resource network and synergize with local
and national partners to conduct clinical and translational research in Puerto Rico.
Specific Aim 2: Provide professional development activities to enhance the ability of investigators to develop
competitive clinical and translational research programs with emphasis on Hispanic health needs.
Specific Aim 3: Facilitate the generation and dissemination of knowledge to and from the bench and the
community to improve health outcomes that affect Hispanic communities in Puerto Rico and across United
States.
Specific Aim 4: Catalyze and sustain the integration of trans/multi/inter disciplinary collaborations to conduct
clinical and translational research within and across institutions, organizations, community networks and health
programs in Puerto Rico and other IDeA states."
10929359,"The primary goal of the GM/CA@APS Resource is to provide user access to cutting-edge
macromolecular crystallography beamlines to determine 3-D atomic structures of forefront problems in
structural biology. The Resource was founded in 1999 and has been in operation as a national user
facility since 2004, providing a full array of cutting-edge technologies for macromolecular crystallography
in Sector 23 at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory. GM/CA is led by
Robert Fischetti (Argonne National Laboratory, contact PI) and Janet Smith (University of Michigan, PI)
with an effective administrative structure to operate, maintain, and upgrade the beamlines, and run a
high-impact user program. The GM/CA macromolecular crystallography core provides a modern,
powerful environment with sophisticated tools for sample screening, interrogation and data collection in
fixed-energy, SAD and MAD modes through operation of two insertion-device X-ray beamlines, 23ID-B
and 23ID-D, from canted-undulator sources. The beamlines are independently tunable over a wide
energy range and are built to deliver a brilliant X-ray beam with exceptionally stable position and intensity.
The exceptional stability makes GM/CA an ideal facility for anomalous scattering, and users can quickly
(few minutes) change energy at will within the 5.0-20 keV range (λ = 2.48 Å - 0.62 Å). The stable beam
enables a powerful microcrystallography capability. Small beams for microcrystallography are created by
a quad mini-beam collimator with user-selectable beam sizes of 5-, 10- and 20-micron diameter in
addition to the full beam. Users can rapidly (within seconds) change beam size for any sample at any
time without beam realignment. The beamlines are equipped with fast, low-noise pixel-array detectors,
an Eiger 16M on 23ID-B and a Pilatus3 6M on 23ID-D. Cryo-protected samples are robotically mounted
from a 288-sample Dewar and can be visualized and manipulated in the beam with micron precision.
Users control the beamlines and samples with the intuitive and biologist-friendly JBluIce graphical user
interface. JBluIce includes GUI-based functions for beamline control, sample centering, sample
screening, data collection, X-ray fluorescence energy scan, raster scan of the sample, and data analysis.
The powerful raster feature is used to scan fields of micro-crystals or to find the best diffracting region of
a larger crystal. Information from raster scans can be shared with the data collection routine for a variety
of data collection options. The data analysis routines provide unit cell and resolution estimates to
formulate a strategy for data collection, which is automatically coupled to three data processing pipelines,
providing users with feedback in near realtime. During the 2016-2018 period, a total of 857 unique
individuals from 157 unique groups used GM/CA beamlines, and annually interrogated 35,000 samples,
deposited 225 structures in the PDB, and published 130 papers (12% in Nature, Science, and Cell).
Serial crystallography methodologies are implemented and integrated into the JBluIce automated data
collection and processing pipelines for both viscous injector and fixed-target sample delivery
technologies. A computing cluster and storage array network provides high-speed data storage, retrieval,
backup, and realtime data processing. Users receive training from an expert staff, and can collect data
on-site or remotely. The staff also contribute to a variety of community outreach activities including the
annual CCP4/APS Crystallography School. A biochemistry lab provides essential capabilities for sample
preparation and characterization adjacent to the beamlines. A proactive maintenance plan ensures the
high level of performance and minimizes downtown. A major upgrade of beamline optics, endstation, and
computing resources will prepare GM/CA for the planned 2023 arrival of a new storage ring source known
as APS-U. The new optics will enable a focused, 1-micron beam, and the new source will increase
brightness by 100-fold compared to the current APS. Outreach activities, user workshops, and new user
training materials will prepare the user community for the opportunities and challenges of APS-U."
10763849,"The mission of the Biophysics Collaborative Access Team (BioCAT) is to provide user access to a state-of-the-
art synchrotron beamline (18ID) for diffraction and scattering of non-crystalline biological materials at the
Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Lab. Continued evolution of the beamline since first light in 1997
has resulted in a unique in the USA fiber diffraction program, and a world-class Bio-SAXS program with unique
capabilities both in the equilibrium and time-resolved realms. The use of size exclusion chromatography in line
with the SAXS camera has ensured unprecedentedly high data quality even with biochemically challenging
samples otherwise thought to be intractable for SAXS. The recent incorporation of MALS and DLS in line with
SEC allows additional biophysical characterization that can be invaluable in interpreting SAXS data from
difficult systems. Our new coflow sheath flow sample cell has revolutionized SAXS data acquisition by
preventing radiation damage, enhancing efficiency accompanied by significant increases in signal to noise.
BioCAT maintains specialized apparatuses for combined time-resolved X-ray diffraction and physiological
studies of cardiac and skeletal muscle. These studies have extended in scope from basic biophysical problems
to address new disease models including cardiomyopathies. A traditional strength is fiber diffraction of general
fibrous protein systems that has recently expanded into scanning diffraction imaging of fibrous protein
structures in complex tissue samples. A major strength of the resource is the experienced and dedicated
scientific staff who assist users seven days a week in data acquisition, processing, analysis and interpretation.
BioCAT is directed by Dr. Thomas Irving, who has more than 20 years of experience overseeing synchrotron
facilities for non-crystalline diffraction and scattering. Dr. Jesse Hopkins oversaw installation of the new coflow
SAXS sample cell, established new user-friendly GUI based data acquisition interfaces, and provide advanced
tools to interpret SEC-SAXS data. Dr. Hopkins develops and maintains the BioXTAS RAW SAXS data
processing and analysis software package and will extend it to allow increased automation to optimize
productivity while minimizing on-site effort for users. Dr. Srinivas Chakravarthy BioCAT’s resident biochemist
coordinates the SAXS user program, assists users with conducting experiments on site, and also maintains the
biochemical infrastructure. Dr. Weikang Ma is an expert in fiber diffraction of muscle and is responsible for
providing comprehensive support to all our fiber diffraction users. All four of these individuals are involved in
training and dissemination activities, including scientific publications, presentations at conferences,
organization of BioCAT workshops and participating in community organized workshops. BioCAT has an
updated website with a comprehensive set of instructions for all aspects of the resource that are sufficient for a
user to plan and execute successful experiments at the beamline. Together the SAXS and Fiber Diffraction
user programs host 70-90 user groups per year and consistently produce 30-40 publications per year."
10911054,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) afflicts patients of both sexes and across a broad age range and is highly
lethal, if not promptly diagnosed and appropriately treated. Despite advances in the understanding of its
pathogenesis and the development of 14 therapies approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) over the past 2-3 decades, it continues to be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The
fundamental premise in this PPG is that PAH is highly heterogeneous regarding clinical parameters including
initiating factors, clinical presentation, rate of progression, and response to therapy. Importantly, patient-to-
patient heterogeneity, involving the types of pulmonary vascular lesions and the corresponding endotypes (i.e.,
underlying molecular processes driving the specific disease presentation), has been uncovered by our group
and underlies the high complexity of disease pathogenesis. The paucity of investigations of these broader
aspects of heterogeneity has resulted in a lack of understanding of specific factors contributing to particular sub-
phenotypes of PAH – negatively impacting the development of more targeted (and individualized) therapies.
These limitations manifest in the fact that some patients live many years on currently available treatments –
however without cure of their disease -, while others progress rapidly and inexorably from onset to transplantation
or death. This proposal seeks to uncover novel pathogenetic processes linking pulmonary vascular inflammation,
remodeling, and molecular underpinnings of pulmonary vascular lesions in PH, while recognizing the key
pathological and pathobiological heterogeneity of the disease. The central premise to be tested in this
proposal is that early and persistent local, pulmonary vascular-specific activation of complement leads
to persistent perivascular inflammation and extracellular matrix changes, thus shaping a feed-forward
loop of pro- inflammatory/pro-remodeling perivascular microenvironment, leading to development of
PH. This application represents a major step towards identifying new biomarkers and more effective
individualized treatments, which are critically needed."
10917387,"Project Summary (Overall)
The chromatin landscape impacts fundamental cellular processes including gene expression, DNA damage
repair, and cell fate and differentiation, all of which are extensively dysregulated in cancer. The collective number
of oncogenic mutations in chromatin regulators has led to the emerging view of driver mutations underlying
cancer epigenomes. In keeping with theme, over the past several years our current collaborative program
members have been critical to the discovery and characterization of ‘classical’ oncohistone mutations in the
histone H3.3 N-terminal tail. These mutations globally alter chromatin by inhibiting the activity of chromatin
modifying enzymes. While much progress has been made to understand these effects, important questions
remain including the nature of the dysregulation of chromatin modifying enzymes by these mutations and how
these mutations lead to cancer. In addition, Program members have recently identified an expanded number of
cancer-associated somatic histone mutations that occur in as many as 4 % of human cancers and involve both
globular and tail domains of all four core histones. These findings generate additional important questions such
as if the newly observed histone mutations have functional effects on chromatin and through what mechanisms
they rely on. Given that some of the most prevalent mutations are in the globular domains of histones, we
hypothesize that these mutations affect nucleosome structure and/or integrity. Lastly, we and others have also
identified a novel function of the EZHIP protein, which is overexpressed in posterior fossa A ependymomas, and
acts as an oncohistone mimic to directly inhibit the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) function. The single
goal of our Program is to illuminate the molecular mechanisms underlying classical and novel “oncohistone”
mutations and oncohistone mimics to advance the diagnosis and exploration of therapeutic avenues for the
cancers. Specifically, we will: i) develop and employ novel patient sample-, cell culture- and animal model-based
systems to recapitulate oncohistone-associated cancers and investigate the underlying pathogenic mechanisms;
ii) evaluate the activity of a comprehensive set of novel cancer-associated histone mutations using a
multidisciplinary approach that includes genetics (barcoded oncohistone libraries, mouse models, barcoded-cell
lines), epigenetics (ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, DNA-methylation profiling), transcriptomics (RNA-seq), and chemical
biology (“designer chromatin”, small molecule inhibitors); iii) define the mechanisms by which oncohistones, and
oncohistone-mimics, dysregulate the Polycomb Repressive Complexes (PRC1 and PRC2) activity to promote
gliomas and bone tumors; and iv) identify which of novel histone mutations perturb chromatin states (and by
what mechanisms) to subsequently cause cellular phenotype using newly developed high-throughput
biochemical and yeast genetic screening tools. These studies will inform future work towards the development
of therapeutic strategies designed to ameliorate the pathogenic effects of histone mutations and oncohistone
mimics in cancer."

This Program Project grant will establish the fully integrated interdisciplinary programs of research and core
facilities that are necessary to develop a fundamental understanding of the complex interplay between two
rapidly emerging fields in cancer therapy: 1) targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT) and 2) immunotherapy. Our
overarching objectives are to develop a detailed mechanistic understanding of the immunomodulatory capacity
of TRT agents and to evaluate and compare the ability of these agents to elicit cooperative therapeutic
interactions in combination with immunotherapies. To achieve this, we will employ a representative variety of
TRT agents to deliver radiation in vivo using clinically relevant murine tumor models and companion canines that
have spontaneously developed cancers. We will determine the precise dosimetry for each radionuclide-, TRT
vector-, and tumor model. This will facilitate studies of dose-, dose-rate-, and dose-range-dependent effects on
the host immune system, tumor infiltrating immune cells, cytokine expression in the tumor microenvironment,
immune susceptibility of tumor cells, mechanisms of immune suppression, and the development of antigen-
specific adaptive immunity. We will determine the functional consequences of these effects by testing the broad
hypothesis that, by modulating tumor immune tolerance and functional immunogenicity at all tumor sites, TRT
will increase response to certain cancer immunotherapies. We will test this in the following Program Projects:
 Project 1: Novel TRTs for Dosimetry-Guided Immunomodulation
Project 2: TRT to enhance tumor cell immune susceptibility and response to immune checkpoint inhibitors
Project 3: Combining TRT with a localized in situ vaccine to overcome immune suppression in the tumor
 microenvironment and augment T cell responses
Project 4: TRT with tumor-specific vaccine to stimulate and expand T-cell activation
These highly integrated projects will not only benefit from the methods and findings generated in one another,
but they also will directly benefit from the expertise and service of four essential Core Facilities: 1) Advanced
imaging and dosimetry core (AIDC), 2) Radiopharmaceutical and radiochemistry core (RPRC), 3) Biostatistics
and bioinformatics core (BBC), and 4) Administrative core. Complementing these are robust institutional facilities
that will enable successful completion of our proposed studies. Our multidisciplinary team brings together the
broad expertise needed to mobilize these resources in pursuit of our proposed objectives. These efforts will
further benefit from robust institutional matching support, leadership of a strong Internal Advisory Committee,
invaluable Industry collaborations, and expertise of an External Advisory Board. Because of the immediate and
broad potential for clinical translation of our results, these studies portend an opportunity to improve the treatment
of any oncology patient, regardless of cancer type, tumor location, burden of disease, or patient age."

10909059,"Biomedical problems are innately complex, and their solutions require input from many fields. Many centers
focus on a single disease or organ system. By contrast, the Center for Modeling Complex Interactions focuses
on an approach that can address many biomedical problems: team-based, interdisciplinary research centered
around modeling. Our goal is to support and facilitate biomedical discovery by integrating modeling into
interdisciplinary research. Modeling improves research at all stages—hypothesis formulation, experimental
design, analysis, and interpretation. It provides a unifying language by which exchange of ideas can highlight
commonalities and uncover unforeseen connections between problems. Formalization of ideas into this
unifying language also improves rigor and reproducibility. We define modeling broadly to include everything
from deterministic and stochastic mathematical approaches, to physical and computational models of three-
dimensional objects, to agent-based and machine learning approaches where exact solutions are not possible.
We seek to support modelers by increasing their numbers, and by giving them opportunities to play on
interdisciplinary teams. We seek to support empiricists by giving them access to relevant modeling expertise,
and by creating a community and a culture to facilitate interdisciplinary research. In Phase I, the Center for
Modeling Complex Interactions created the intellectual, cultural, and physical environment to promote team-
based, interdisciplinary research. In Phase II, we will build on that foundation by maintaining a strong
interdisciplinary culture to foster collaboration among people who might otherwise never connect, and by
adding additional faculty to expand our modeling expertise. We have four Aims: 1) Support faculty to carry out
model-based, interdisciplinary biomedical research and increase their competitiveness for external funding.
Research in the Center is carried out in the context of Working Groups—zero-barrier, interdisciplinary, goal-
focused teams that meet regularly to get work done. Supported research includes three Research Projects,
Pilot Projects, Modeling Access Grants, and ad hoc teams. Our comprehensive plan for proposal preparation
improves grantsmanship, and our staff assists with submission and grant management. 2) Increase University
of Idaho’s faculty participation in biomedical research. We will add six new faculty as a commitment to this
Phase II COBRE and attract broader participation from across the University. 3) Extend the reach of the
Modeling Core into new areas of modeling to capitalize on emerging opportunities. The Modeling Core
accelerates interdisciplinary research by placing Core Fellows at the hub of the research community. We have
added new Core Initiatives in machine learning and geospatial modeling to stimulate research in these areas
with high potential for future growth. 4) Establish a path to long-term sustainability under the umbrella of the
Institute for Modeling Collaboration & Innovation. The major hurdle for sustainability is to maintain a robust
Modeling Core. We have developed a business plan that calls for us to diversify our funding sources to include
institutional, state, and private support to supplement federal grants."
10844401,"The University of Louisville (UofL) Hepatobiology and Toxicology (H&T) COBRE is a unique thematic
center focused on liver research. The UofL H&T COBRE concentrates on the mechanisms and therapeutic
strategies for multiple forms of liver disease/injury, including: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease/non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis—the most common liver disease in the US/worldwide, and is highly linked to the metabolic
syndrome; Alcoholic Liver Disease—a common problem among those who drink; Environmental Toxicant
Induced Liver Injury—an increasingly recognized problem, and Louisville has been a leader in this area;
Hepatitis B and C—important causes of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide; Personalized
Medicine—an increasingly important factor in medication efficacy, and most drugs are metabolized in the liver;
and Drug-Induced Liver Injury—the most common reason drugs are removed from the market and an
important cause of liver failure. This COBRE brings together experienced senior mentors/investigators and
promising junior investigators to perform cross-cutting research on the unique topics of Hepatobiology and
Toxicology. We address critical barriers in our understanding of the development/ progression of liver disease
and we define targets for prevention/treatment that could transform clinical practice.
 Specific Aims of the Hepatobiology and Toxicology COBRE are to:
1. Expand and strengthen a thematically-focused program in Hepatobiology and Toxicology that helps build
and sustain the overall research infrastructure at UofL.
2. Expand and strengthen the multidisciplinary program in research education, mentoring and career
development in Hepatobiology and Toxicology, and systematically track and evaluate the progress.
3. Provide the necessary research resources and translational science/basic technologies to support state-of-
the-art research in Hepatobiology and Toxicology and to ensure sustainability of the program.
4. Discover new mechanisms/molecular targets and effective means for preventing and/or treating liver
diseases/toxicant exposures and communicate our findings to the public.
 In summary, Phase I strengthened UofL’s biomedical research infrastructure through the establishment of
a thematic multidisciplinary center in hepatobiology and toxicology to enhance the ability of investigators to
compete for independent funding. In Phase I, we met or exceeded our metrics, including 1) four of our
investigators transitioning to independent research funding; 2) 91 mentee and 162 total publications; 3) new
renovated laboratory space; 4) numerous presentations; 5) establishing new collaborations; and 6) >$75
million in total new grant funding by H&T members. This Phase II proposal builds on our Phase I success,
extends and strengthens the scope of the program, and provides a roadmap for sustainability."

The University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center
(OAIC) has been funded since 2000. It is the home of a diverse multidisciplinary team of investigators with
complementary research interests in aging. We have discovered mechanisms of sarcopenia in cells, animal
models and humans; identified trajectories of functional loss and disability in diverse populations; developed
and tested interventions to improve functional recovery and independence. We have trained 31 Scholars (45%
women, 26% minority), and published more than 640 papers.
In the next cycle, we will build on our established infrastructure and accomplishments to support innovative
multidisciplinary research and train the next generation of leaders in gerontology and geriatrics. The UTMB
OAIC’s guiding theme is “Translate Pathways of Function Loss and Gain into Interventions to Optimize
Functional Recovery in Diverse Geriatric Populations”.
Our program’s aims are:
 1. Discover mechanisms and define trajectories of age-related functional loss and gain.
 2. Develop and test innovative interventions to optimize functional recovery.
 3. Translate interventions to the clinical setting in diverse populations.
 4. Train the future leaders in gerontology and geriatric research.
We will use an integrative approach to translate basic discoveries into interventions for functional recovery and
improve the trajectories of functional loss and disability in older adults. By leveraging partnerships with other

The UPMC Hillman Cancer Center (HCC) at University of Pittsburgh is a matrix cancer center, currently led by
Robert L. Ferris, MD, PhD, who has served as Director of HCC since 2017. With funding from the National
Cancer Institute and other peer- and non-peer-reviewed sources, HCC conducts impactful basic,
clinical/translational, and population science research that is changing the way we detect, diagnose, and treat
cancer. Through our research and community outreach efforts, we address the needs and disparities of cancer
patients and those who are at risk of developing cancer in our 29-county western Pennsylvania catchment
area, and through our strong efforts in educating and training new cancer researchers and clinicians, we are
ensuring that those needs will continue to be met in the years to come.
HCC integrates the expertise and resources of the University of Pittsburgh, a top-5 institution in NIH funding,
and UPMC, one of our nation’s largest health care systems, to provide our 280 members with state-of-the-art
facilities and equipment, and numerous opportunities for interaction and collaboration. Organized into 7
research programs focused on Cancer Biology, Genome Stability, Cancer Virology, Cancer Immunology and
Immunotherapy, Cancer Therapeutics, Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention, and Biobehavioral Cancer
Control, our members published over 4,000 articles and enrolled more than 12,700 adult and pediatric patients
onto interventional clinical trials from 2014-2018. These efforts were enabled by our 10 shared resources and
extensive infrastructure for supporting clinical research at central academic and community network sites.
HCC is guided by an experienced Senior Leadership Team of Deputy and Associate Directors who join Dr.
Ferris in overseeing our science and operations. With input from the leaders of our research programs and
other key HCC members, this team sets the vision and develops the strategic plan for our future development,
which includes a new HCC-wide Administrative Core for supporting team science. Over the next 5 years, HCC
aims to: 1) expand upon our existing scientific strengths; 2) augment our shared resources; 3) develop and
implement strategies for reducing cancer-related health problems in our catchment area population; 4)
increase transdisciplinary research in topics that include tumor genomics and precision medicine, translational
cancer immunotherapy, and environmental factors that impact cancers in our catchment area, and cancer and
aging; 5) increase focus on education and learning at all levels of training; 6) implement precision medicine; 7)
seek institutional and philanthropic funding to support faculty recruitment and retention, and the facilities and
shared resources needed to advance our research initiatives; and 8) continue to engage in the dynamic
planning and decision-making process that was instituted by our new Director."

OVERALL - PROJECT SUMMARY
This is the 3nd CCSG competitive renewal application of the Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center
(DLDCCC) at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) in Houston, Texas. Houston is the 4th largest city in the
United States with a very diverse population and Harris County is one of the most rapidly growing in the
country. The DLDCCC Catchment Area has expanded from the core of Harris county to include the 8
surrounding counties which comprise the Houston Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), representing a
diverse population of more than 7 million individuals (this population is greater than 35 states). The
DLDCCC is a matrix center with BCM as the lead partner with 4 hospital affiliates, Texas Children’s, the
DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Ben Taub Hospital, and the new Baylor St. Luke’s Medical Center
as formal affiliates. The DLDCCC received NCI designation in 2007 and comprehensive designation in 2014
and through our evaluation and planning process and recommendations from our EAC and internal
committees, we have since made significant progress strengthening our scientific programs. 53 new cancer
faculty have been recruited to the DLDCCC which now has 192 Research members, 78 Clinical members and
18 Adjunct members. Our cancer-relevant peer reviewed research funding now exceeds $169 million, with
more than $49 million ($34M direct) coming from the NCI. Several important scientific accomplishments have
been made that have an impact in our Catchment Area and globally. The DLDCCC comprises 7 research
programs: Cell Signaling and Metabolism, Mechanism of Cancer Evolution, Nuclear Receptor, Transcription
and Chromatin Biology, Breast Cancer, Cancer Cell and Gene Therapy, Cancer Prevention and Population
Science, and Pediatric Cancer. Significant investments have strengthened the 10 Shared Resources, which
offer leading technologies. A new shared resource in Advanced In Vivo Cancer Models further enhances our
capabilities. The Clinical Protocol and Data Management Core has been significantly enhanced and accruals
to clinical trials have increased. Accrual of racial and ethnic minorities is outstanding. The Office of Outreach
and Health Disparities which drives COE disseminates new information and services to the community,
especially the underserved. Training and education have been integrated into our Programs through the CRCE
core. In this renewal, we ask for increased funding for our 10 Shared Resources and other expanded activities
important to our mission and goals."
10864014,"We propose to continuously improve the Yale/NIDA Neuroproteomics Center that brings exceptionally
strong Yale programs in proteomics and signal transduction in the brain together with neuroscientists from 8
other institutions across the U.S. to create a national resource that will collaborate to identify adaptive changes
in protein signaling that occur in response to substances of abuse. Twenty-three faculty with established
records of highly innovative research into the molecular actions of psychoactive addictive drugs, as well as of
other basic aspects of neurobiology, will work together in a unique synergy with the Keck Foundation
Biotechnology Laboratory to create the Center, whose theme is “Proteomics of Altered Signaling in Addiction”.
The Center will use cutting edge proteomic technologies to analyze neuronal signal transduction mechanisms
and the adaptive changes in these processes that occur in response to drugs of abuse. With Co-Directors
Angus Nairn (Psychiatry) and Kenneth Williams (Mol. Biophys. & Biochem.) in the Administrative Core, the
Center includes Discovery Proteomics (DPC) and Targeted Proteomics (TPC) Cores. Biophysical technologies
from the DPC will extend protein profiling analyses into the functional domain while lipid analyses from the
DPC will leverage proteome level analyses to provide an increasingly biological systems level approach. A
Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core (BBC) that includes high performance computing and the Bioinformatics
Support Program in the Yale Medical Library will provide essential support that will leverage the value of each
of the proteomic technology cores. A Pilot Research Project Core is a cornerstone in our efforts to encourage
strong mentoring relationships that will help attract and train future outstanding scientists.
 Behavioral adaptations that accompany drug addiction are believed to result from both short and long-term
adaptive changes in brain reward centers. Thus, exposure to drugs of abuse regulates intracellular signaling
processes that alter gene expression, protein translation, and protein post-translational modifications.
Repeated exposure to drugs of abuse leads to stable alterations in these signaling systems that are critical for
the changes in brain chemistry and structure of the addicted brain. The Center's research goals include
analysis of the actions of cannabis, cocaine, nicotine, and opioids on these intracellular signaling pathways in
brain reward areas and development of methods that enable proteomic analysis of the single types of neurons
that define the circuits that underlie the actions and addictive properties of drugs of abuse. Targeted and data-
independent MS analyses of signaling proteins implicated in the actions of drugs of abuse will be used to
analyze the impact of substance abuse on the neuroproteome with motif-based, “Middle-down” MS/MS, and
other novel approaches being used to study protein post-translational modifications and to uncover the
interactomes of key proteins. A major initiative of the BBC will be to develop novel methods for deep
integration of genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data with brain region, cell type and allele-specificity."
10872281,"SUMMARY
Survivors of brain injuries such as stroke and trauma often endure life-long disabilities, which span a
spectrum of deficits and are associated with enormous individual and societal costs. There is an urgent
need to develop effective interventions that can improve cognitive and motor outcomes, especially
individualized approaches that target specific disruptions of brain physiology or circuits. The Center for
Brain Recovery and Repair was established in Phase I as an interdisciplinary community of investigators to
address these issues. A cohort of junior faculty successfully launched new independent research programs
and have remained centrally active within the Center. Together with core leadership and other established
investigators from diverse departments and programs across campus, we have established a highly
interactive nucleus, working closely together in a physical home in Domenici Hall. Phase II activities build
on this progress, by adding additional layers of mentored faculty, projects and resources required to ensure
a self-sustaining, high impact Center. The Center will maintain its successful focus on moving laboratory
discoveries about brain injury mechanisms into clinical application, and will therefore continue to emphasize
a structure that promotes extensive mentoring and interaction between preclinical and clinical investigators.
The physical home in Domenici Hall will be enhanced, to strengthen state-of-the-art facilities for both rodent
studies and clinical interventions and assessment. Recordings from brain-injured patients in the neuro
intensive care unit will also be studied in our Domenici Hall core facilities in Phase II, to address novel,
actionable mechanisms earlier in the progression of brain injury. Innovative combinations of
electrophysiology, imaging and cognitive assessment will be led by both the clinical and preclinical cores,
with extensive cross-fertilization of ideas and approaches. An exciting set of projects using these cores will
be led by junior faculty from different departments, addressing different severities and consequences of
traumatic brain injury. An expanded pilot program, together with new partnerships and tenure-track hires
will further increase the critical mass of investigators in the Center, supporting fiscal sustainability and
increasing competitiveness for center-level support with additional extramural grants. The Center will
leverage existing facilities and trainings at UNM, and expand valuable collaborations with regional IDeA
programs for pipeline development and resource sharing. The significantly enhanced research capabilities
will thus be available for a larger constituency of brain and behavioral health investigators in New Mexico, and
investigators in other IDeA states. Such outcomes are expected to have an important positive impact, as they
will greatly accelerate the discovery and adoption of interventions that are urgently needed for large numbers
of individuals in IDeA communities living with the devastating consequences of brain injury."

Targeting Lung Cancer Vulnerabilities. The University of Texas SPORE in Lung Cancer represents a unique
collaboration between the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) and the University of Texas
MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC), both of which have outstanding strengths in lung cancer translational
and clinical research. The overarching goal of the SPORE is to develop new therapeutic paradigms based on
recently identified “vulnerabilities” acquired during lung cancer pathogenesis, including a molecular
understanding of lung cancers in individual patients, and using this information to “personalize” therapy for each
lung cancer patient. Thus, our strategy is to identify lung cancer “therapeutic quartets” which include: 1. a
specific vulnerability; 2. the mechanism of action thus defining therapeutic target(s) for the vulnerability; 3. a
deliverable treatment for the target(s); and 4. tumor molecular biomarkers for the vulnerability predicting specific
therapies for each patient. The UT Lung Cancer SPORE builds on a 20-year productive history, incorporating
recent advances made by our SPORE investigators and the rest of the lung cancer translational research
community in the molecular and mechanistic understanding of tumor autonomous and microenvironment
changes, acquired vulnerabilities, and important immuno-oncology effects. These advances include novel
approaches to identifying and molecularly classifying vulnerabilities in lung cancer metabolomic changes,
cancers immunologically “inert” to PD1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockade, the lung cancer fibrotic stroma
(microenvironment), and tumorigenesis-induced replication stress. Our contributions also include preclinical
human and mouse model systems for testing the different vulnerabilities, as well as large legacy molecular and
clinically annotated preclinical model and clinical specimen datasets. The SPORE is composed of 4 projects,
all of which have Human Endpoints: 1. Targeting metabolic vulnerabilities in lung cancer; 2. Targeting
vulnerabilities in immunologically-inert lung cancer; 3. Targeting vulnerabilities in the fibrotic extracellular matrix
(ECM) of lung cancers; and 4. Therapeutic targeting of oncogene-induced replication stress for tumor cell killing
and anti-tumor immunity in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (which includes a clinical trial targeting replication
stress combined with immune checkpoint inhibtion. There are three cores: A. Administrative (including patient
advocates); B. Molecular Pathology and Tissue Resources; and C. Data Sciences, as well as strong
Developmental Research and Career Enhancement Programs (DRP, CEP). Our SPORE features leading
lung cancer multi-disciplinary clinical and laboratory scientists, a cadre of experienced patient advocates, and
an outstanding publication record. Moving forward, this SPORE will provide information on newly identified lung
cancer acquired vulnerabilities, biomarkers for personalizing individual patient therapy, and important preclinical
and information to facilitate clinical translation that has the possibility of changing the face of lung cancer therapy."

PROJECT SUMMARY
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common life-shortening genetic disease that causes progressive lung failure due
to recurrent infections and airway obstruction. While our knowledge of CFTR function has advanced
greatly in the 30 years since the discovery of the gene, treatments for the disease remain suboptimal and
CF remains progressive and fatal. Advances with small molecule CFTR modulator therapies have
helped restore protein function for many mutations, but approximately 10% of people with CF have not
benefited from these strategies, including people with nonsense and splicing mutations. The central
theme of this proposal is developing new molecular therapies to prevent or treat CF lung disease.
The goal of our three projects and four cores is to exploit the power of our in vitro and animal models to
address questions fundamental to lung disease pathogenesis and to use this knowledge to inform new
therapeutic strategies to complement CF defects, including gene repair and the addition of a small
molecule that forms anion channels. The three closely interrelated Projects will work together to
accomplish the following goals: 1) To restore CFTR function using targeted single nucleotide
editing. We hypothesize that cells in the surface airway epithelium, including those with progenitor
capacity, can be targeted to repair CFTR mutations using base editing. 2) To understand the
mechanisms of amphotericin B (AmB)-induced anion secretion in airway epithelia and to test the
hypothesis that AmB can restore CF host defenses in vivo. AmB is a small molecule that forms
anion channels. 3) To determine how CFTR expression in pulmonary ionocytes and ciliated cells
regulates properties of the airway surface liquid that are crucial for clearance and innate
immunity. The development of effective gene therapies for cystic fibrosis lung disease must be guided
by a clear understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms of disease and the relevant cellular targets for
CFTR gene replacement or editing.
The Project Leaders and their teams have outstanding track records of collaborative CF research, and
here they sharpen their focus to a common goal. Their highly creative research is supported by four
cores that provide innovative infrastructure and services. Through these studies we hope to accelerate
the development of new therapeutics for CF lung disease.

This Core Support Center Grant (P30) application requests continued support for an analytical chemistry
laboratory and administrative shared core infrastructure, and support for a pilot project core. The participating,
currently funded, constituent projects continue research programs with human laboratory and treatment clinic
studies of the clinical pharmacology of abused drugs, pharmacotherapies and other treatment strategies to
treat drug abuse and addictions, and studies of the underlying causes and health consequences of drug
addiction with the goal of improving therapies, reducing harm, and guiding public policy. Disciplines
represented by the participating projects and investigators include psychiatry, psychology, internal medicine,
cardiology, occupational medicine, pulmonary medicine, pediatrics, toxicology, environmental public health,
dentistry, and chemistry. Currently, most of the supported projects involve the problems associated with
tobacco addiction, but some are studies of cannabis and these are increasing with grant proposals submitted
or in preparation. We are prepared to support studies of other abused drugs as well, with validated methods
used in past studies, as well as the capability to develop new methods. Projects supported by the Pilot Project
Core will likely involve other drugs of abuse, facilitated by encouraging scholars in UCSF's Learning for Early
Careers in Addiction & Diversity (LEAD) Program whose studies involve a variety of abused substances, to
apply for pilot project funding. Our aims are: (1) To provide a state-of-the-art, well equipped and staffed,
analytical chemistry laboratory resource for the participating projects of drug abuse researchers at UCSF and
at other institutions. (2) A Pilot Project Core with the overarching goal of building a pipeline of investigators
with the skills and experience to conduct high quality, cutting edge, and/or rapid response research in
substance abuse and prevention. (3) To provide administrative support for manuscript preparation, IRB and
related regulatory documents, grants management, and other research administrative services of value
participating projects. (4) To provide statistical consulting services regarding study design and data analysis
strategies, particularly optimal pharmacokinetic analysis to participating projects. The overall objective is to
provide sophisticated analytical laboratory resources with stability of support together with adequate
administrative support responsive to the needs of individual funded constituent scientific projects as those
projects change and evolve. This facility is a cost-effective shared laboratory resource that enhances and
extends research possibilities of investigators currently funded by NIH or other federal or nonfederal agencies
to further our understanding of human psychoactive drug use, abuse and addiction, its health consequences
and its treatment management."

mHealth Center for Discovery, Optimization & Translation
of Temporally-Precise Interventions (mDOT) – Overall
Abstract: Providing care for patients with chronic diseases is one of the biggest drivers of the nation’s rising
healthcare spending. Many of these diseases are inextricably linked to mutable health behaviors such as poor
diet, lack of physical activity, and smoking. A key strategy for making self-care and preventive health behaviors
more achievable has been the integration of passive monitoring into everyday life via mobile sensors and
providing personalized information and guidance to patients. But, to have the maximum long-term efficacy, such
mHealth interventions must be delivered at the most opportune moment and its content must be dynamically
personalized to the individual, their current context, and changing preferences.
Our proposed mHealth Center for Discovery, Optimization & Translation of Temporally-Precise Interventions
(the mDOT Center) will provide the methods, tools, and infrastructure for researchers to discover, optimize and
deploy temporally-precise mHealth interventions. Organized around three Technology Research & Development
(TR&D) projects, mDOT represents a unique national resource that will develop multiple methodological and
technological innovations, including easily deployable wearables, apps for wearables and smartphones, and a
companion mHealth cloud system, all open-source. TR&D1 will develop, evaluate and disseminate methods to
analyze population-scale multi-modal time series of mHealth biomarkers to identify the momentary risk factors
and risk dynamics that drive adverse health outcomes, while accounting for the uncertainty and missingness
inherent in these data sources. TR&D2 will develop new reinforcement learning methods to personalize the
selection and delivery of mHealth interventions to individuals at their own optimal times and locations so as to
maintain user engagement and provide precise and maximal health benefits. TR&D3 will develop, validate and
disseminate algorithms, tools and software/hardware designs that will enable large-scale deployment of
resource-efficient, real-time, low-latency and privacy-aware digital biomarkers. Together, these mDOT
deliverables will transform the ability of researchers and innovators to exploit the exploding range of sensors and
mobile technologies to develop and deliver dynamically personalized and temporally-precise mHealth
interventions to individuals. The iterative “push-pull” interaction with collaborative projects (CP) and direct
dissemination to service projects (SP’s) will ensure that the technologies developed by our TR&Ds’ solve real-
world problems, are usable by other researchers, and will have the broadest impact.
The mDOT Center’s training and dissemination (T&D) activities will seek to maximize the societal impact of our
technologies by promoting broad distribution and uptake of mDOT technologies and resulting software beyond
mDOT affiliates. Finally, a unifying mDOT administrative core and optimized operating procedures will facilitate
interactions among TR&D researchers and their associated CPs and SPs; assess the productivity and impact of
Center activities; and provide ongoing management, oversight, and planning.

The overall goals of the Pittsburgh Claude D. Pepper Older American Independence Center (OAIC), funded
since 2004, are to address the critical need to improve mobility, balance and falls risk, both through improved
understanding of their causes and through development of preventive and therapeutic interventions. With this
renewal we also will extend our work into new and high potential areas and bring several innovations to our
activities and Cores.
Specific aims for the next 5 years are to:
1) Promote multidisciplinary research that will elucidate the causes, consequences and management of age-
related changes in mobility and balance.
2) Further extend our work into two high potential areas: a) translational investigations to examine interactions
between multiple systems at the level of molecules, signaling systems, cells and their organelles, and tissues,
as they impact mobility and balance in living organisms, and b) impact on individual older adults of health
system, community and long-term care interventions to enhance mobility and balance.
3) Train young investigators from multiple disciplines to become national leaders in age-related mobility and
balance problems in a vibrant, collaborative environment and build a translational sciences workforce through
collaborative basic and clinical sciences team mentoring.
4) Serve as a champion and invaluable resource for investigators, research programs, institutions, OAICs and
the public in the area of mobility and balance in older adults.
Our accomplishments and plans build on our fundamental values: 1) a cohesive theme that accommodates
multiple approaches and opportunities to address critical gaps in knowledge, 2) a commitment to
multidisciplinary research, 3) a stable organization that grows and evolves, and 4) rigorous preparation of
future investigators and leaders.
To accomplish these aims, our OAIC is built around 7 cores. In addition to the Leadership and Administrative

This is the A1 re-submission of a new Program Project Grant (PPG) focused on studying how advanced
melanoma resists targeted therapies and immunotherapies, either upfront or after a period of response, and
this information is aimed at defining the vulnerabilities that provide new therapeutic opportunities. Project 1
(Roger Lo) focuses on the study of resistance of NRASMUT melanomas to targeted therapies and
immunotherapies. Studies will focus on discovering and co-targeting genomic, epigenomic and/or signaling
alterations causative of MEK inhibitor (MEKi) resistance; exploiting MEKi-addiction of MEKi-resistant clones;
and identifying immune targets to augment MEKi efficacy and suppress MEKi resistance in vivo in NRASMUT
melanomas. Project 2 (Thomas Graeber) focuses on studying molecular mechanisms and targeting of the
ferroptosis sensitivity of dedifferentiated melanomas in preclinical models. In addition, this project will also
define and target master regulatory programs underlying melanoma dedifferentiation. Project 3 (Antoni Ribas)
focuses on studying primary and acquired resistance to PD-1 blockade immunotherapy, especially defining
mutations in the interferon gamma and antigen presentation pathways, as well as reversing T cell exclusion
from cancers. The understanding of these resistance mechanisms will rationalize combinatorial therapies to be
tested in preclinical mouse models. The three projects are supported by three cores, the Administrative and
Statistics Core (Antoni Ribas), the Biospecimen Core (Begonya Comin-Anduix) and the Patient-Derived
Xenograft (PDX)/Syngeneic Mouse Core (Gatien Moriceau).
The proposed research addresses scientific problems that require integrated and collaborative teamwork. In
Project 1, the study of MAPK inhibitor addiction, resulting in sensitivity to drugs that induce parthanatos (a
caspase-independent mode of cell death), can be applied to the melanoma dedifferentiation states studied in
Project 2 and will synergize with immunotherapies studied in Project 3. Similarly, in Project 2, the
dedifferentiated melanoma phenotype, which is a resistance mechanism to MAPK inhibitors and also induced
by T cell-released cytokines, leads to sensitivity to ferroptosis- (an iron-dependent form of nonapoptotic cell
death) inducing agents. This resistance mechanism will be explored in NRAS mutant melanoma in Project 1
and across melanoma with resistance to anti-PD1 in Project 3. Reciprocally, Project 3 will seek to integrate
the new concepts and models from Projects 1 and 2, given the likely immune effects of inducing these new
forms of cell death. This collaborative research will require sharing the patient-derived tissues, model systems,
and therapeutic regiments acquired and developed in each Project, facilitated by Cores B and C, and
statistical design and support from Core A.

Abstract: Neuropsychiatric lupus (NPSLE) is a common and debilitating manifestation of
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). For over a decade, we have been studying the
contribution of a subset of anti-DNA antibodies that cross reacts with the N-methyl D-aspartate
receptor, termed DNRAb, to cognitive impairment in NPSLE, and to impairments in fetal health
of DNRAb+ mothers. We have developed a mouse model in which we have now shown that
DNRAb, when they penetrate the hippocampus, cause acute neuronal death subsequently
leading to persistent microglial activation, neuronal dendritic loss, and cognitive impairments.
Suppression of microglial activation by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors leads to
a restoration of neuronal integrity and cognitive function. Using the same model, we have
demonstrated that maternal DNRAb cause death of female fetuses and cognitive impairment in
male offspring through transplacental transport. We have demonstrated in subjects with SLE
that memory impairment is associated with increased titers of DNRAb and that a reduced
microstructural integrity of parahippocampal fibers also associates with DNRAb. We proposed
to continue to study both the mouse model and SLE patients, to understand the mechanisms of
microglial activation and how ACE inhibitors restore neuronal integrity. We will determine how
DNAbs alter male and female fetal brain development. We will assess microglial activation and
loss of blood brain barrier integrity in SLE patients and the association of these abnormalities
with elevated titers of DNRAb.
These studies have already led to a funded clinical trial of ACE inhibitors in non-focal central
nervous system manifestations of NPSLE, and have the potential to reveal additional potential
therapeutic strategies."

Aging is associated with a myriad of deleterious physical consequences. Among them, we as a group have
recently focused our work on the decreased ability to respond to stress whether it is endogenous, e.g., sex
steroid deprivation or exogenous through bacterial infections or various stressors. This is why the focus of this
P01 application is to characterize the role of bone as an endocrine organ in sensing and responding to stress.
This work is largely motivated by the fact that we have in the past 2 years accumulated in vivo and through the
study of gain and loss of functions animal models, numerous experimental evidence that the two molecules
that this group of investigators characterized as bone-derived hormones, osteocalcin, and lipocalin 2, are
involved in allowing the body to respond to stressors of various kinds. In pursuing this line of investigation, we
have also identified one molecule glutamate, as a regulator of both osteocalcin and lipocalin 2 release during a
stress reaction. At the same time, this work was unfolding another member of the original group of
investigators that worked together in this PO1 application has gathered numerous preliminary evidence that an
endogenous stressor such as estrogen deprivation affects β cell number and biology in an osteocalcin-
dependent manner. Lastly, a new member of our group Dr. Lori Zeltser, an accomplished neuroscientist and
an expert in the biology of appetite and thermogenesis, is revisiting at the most fundamental mechanistic level
an observation two project leaders in the PO1 application, Drs. Ducy and Karsenty had made over 13 years
ago. This observation is that osteocalcin favors energy expenditure and as a result the ability to protect from
another stressor, diet-induced obesity. These broad arrays of preliminary results obtained over the course of
13 years converge on asking the following fundamental and novel question that we propose to address in this
application. Is bone as a sensor and responder to stress throughout life? To address as many aspects as
possible of this question, we intend to blend in this application the bone biology endocrinology and
neuroscience expertise of its four PI’s. Therefore, to address the broad questions we are asking, we propose
to test the following Specific Aims: To determine whether the regulation of the release of osteocalcin can be
harnessed to prevent or rescue manifestations of aging (Project#1) To determine whether bone is an acute
inflammation-sensing organ that mounts lifesaving anti-inflammatory responder through lipocalin 2 secretion by
osteoblasts (Project#2). To determine whether estrogen deprivation at menopause enhances the production of
osteocalcin and as a result may affect β cell biology and glucose homeostasis (Project#3). To investigate
mechanistically whether the decrease in circulating osteocalcin during aging is, a least in part, responsible for
the dysregulation of thermogenesis seen during aging (Project#4)."

 The Overall section of this Ovarian Cancer SPORE application describes the Background,
Specific Aims, Innovation, and Research Plan of the three projects and four cores. We emphasize intra-
SPORE collaborations and development of clinical trials with companion biomarkers. Through this SPORE
application, we have tried to address several of the most urgent questions in ovarian cancer therapy. First,
PARP inhibitors are a new and essential feature of high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) therapy, but
many patients eventually have cancer progression on these agents. Accordingly, in Project 1, we have
designed clinical trials with drug combinations and correlative studies which will allow us to systematically
extend the use of PARP inhibitors. Second, we recognize the emerging impact of immunotherapy on solid
tumor treatment. Thus, in Project 2, we have designed a novel vaccine trial for ovarian cancer patients. Third,
HGSC patients with primary refractory disease or those patients with recurrence whose cancer harbor
underlying RAS mutations such as low grade serous or mucinous cancers pose a particularly difficult clinical
problem. Accordingly, in Project 3, we will explore novel non-platinum drug combinations, such as the
combination of a BCL inhibitor and a MEK inhibitor, and will examine predictive biomarkers and tumor
responses evident in the extracellular activity. The Specific Aims of this DF/HCC ovarian cancer SPORE are as
follows: Aim 1 (Project 1): ATR inhibitor-mediated reversal of PARP inhibitor resistance in high-grade serous
ovarian cancer (HGSOC); Aim 2 (Project 2): Combined personal neoantigen-targeting cancer vaccines with

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This is the fifth competing renewal of the Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) at Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer
Center (VICC). VICC is a matrix center within Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Vanderbilt University
that integrates the cancer-related expertise and resources of the Schools of Medicine, Nursing, Arts and
Sciences and Engineering, the Peabody School of Education and the fully integrated Veterans Administration
Medical Center. The major clinical facilities and the majority of research facilities are located on one campus,
which promotes informal interactions, sharing of resources and productive collaborations. Established in 1993,
VICC functions as an organizational unit with a supra-departmental status. VICC-specific responsibilities and
aims are 1) to conduct, support and enhance state-of-the-art, multidisciplinary basic, clinical and population-
based research; 2) to coordinate and integrate cancer-related activities across Vanderbilt and to collaborate with
our local, regional, national and global partners; 3) to train and develop the next generation of cancer
investigators, cancer leaders and the continuum of cancer care providers; and 4) to assess and prioritize
community needs and to leverage partnerships to address those needs through cancer research, care and
control activities. The research, training, and community outreach and engagement objectives are accomplished
through CCSG and institutionally supported organizational capabilities, planning and evaluation, and eight
research programs. The VICC Research Programs are Signal Transduction and Cell Proliferation, Genome
Maintenance, Host-Tumor Interactions, Gastrointestinal Cancer, Translational Research and Interventional
Oncology, Breast Cancer, Cancer Epidemiology, and Cancer Health Outcomes and Control. Eleven shared
resources are proposed, all previously supported. Remarkable VICC growth and scientific discovery over the
past project period has led to 22 new multi-investigator grants for a total of 71, and 8 new training grants for a
total of 26. In addition, two NCI SPOREs were successfully renewed. With these and many other NCI grants,
peer-reviewed funding increased 35%. Significant accomplishments have been made in precision oncology,
cancer epidemiology, health outcomes and control, genomics, cancer drug discovery, early detection and
prevention, and cancer disparities research. Increased VICC space and facilities, along with philanthropic and
institutional funds, supported the recruitment of 67 new faculty, who join a dedicated team carrying out the VICC
mission: to alleviate cancer death and suffering through pioneering research; innovative patient-centered care;
and evidence-based prevention, education and community initiatives. VICC senior leadership provides effective
oversight and catalyzes innovative and paradigm-shifting science that translates to benefit for our patients and
the community we serve in our catchment and reduces the burden of cancer nationally and globally."
10929319,"The past decade has seen rapid growth of gene discovery for primary immunodeficiencies. With the advent of
newborn screening for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), coupled with new applications for deep
sequencing, genomic analyses, high-throughput cellular screening, and CRISPR gene editing, there is an
unprecedented opportunity to establish, by direct testing, how human genetic sequences control immune cell
development, and ultimately to treat SCID by genome editing of causal mutations. Our comprehensive program
will address the major challenges that must be overcome to capitalize on this transformative opportunity, by
integrating clinical data from T cell insufficient patients with basic investigations drawing on the expertise of
leaders in immunology, bioinformatics, target validation, and genome editing. The SCID newborn screening
assay, pioneered by Dr. Puck and implemented in all 50 states in the USA and an increasing number of countries,
employs DNA from infant blood spots to enumerate T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs), a surrogate for
thymic output of new T cells. It is highly effective for identifying infants with T cell insufficiency, whose molecular
etiologies are often revealed by immune phenotyping and sequencing a panel of known SCID genes. Importantly,
however, this unbiased, population-based screening also reveals infants with SCID who lack readily discernable,
deleterious causative mutations, as well as other infants belonging to a previously unrecognized group with non-
SCID T cell lymphopenia (TCL). We and others have applied whole exome sequencing (WES) to enigmatic
cases of SCID and TCL, revealing unanticipated and exciting gene variants that have directly impacted medical
care, while revealing new insights into immune mechanisms. Importantly, however, WES fails to identify disease-
causing mutations in 60% of these enigmatic cases. This may result from incomplete exome capture, poorly
covered exons, or the fact that a disease-causing variant may lie in a non-coding genomic element. This Program
will overcome these limitations by combining variant discovery using whole genome sequencing (WGS), T cell
RNASeq in patients and parents, and robust high-throughput functional assays to solve these difficult cases. Our
work will ultimately usher in an era of novel treatments employing genome editing of autologous hematopoietic
progenitors. To identify the mutation(s) responsible for T cell insufficiency from among candidate variants, we
will perform functional screening in zebrafish, primary human CD34+ cells and human pluripotent stem cell-
derived CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells differentiated in vitro on novel Notch-ligand microbeads.
Moreover, we will use Perturb-seq, a method for single cell transcriptome comparisons and epistatic analysis to
unravel relationships among causal variants and construct a molecular map of human T cell development. Our
combined capabilities, encompassing clinical expertise, genomic analysis, gene editing, high-throughput cellular
screening, zebrafish and functional immunology, have the power to revolutionize our understanding of how
immune cells develop and function while yielding important progress toward new treatment approaches."

(Overall Component)
The three Projects vigorously pursue an understanding of antiviral CD4 and CD8 T cells, linked by the theme:
what transcription factors regulate these cells and how do they do so? T cell differentiation into various effector
cells, and the capacity to differentiate into memory cells, are important parts of adaptive immunity to pathogens
and cancers. Transcription factors (TFs) are central regulators of these differentiation processes. The
identification of key TFs regulating different pathways of CD4 and CD8 T cell differentiation have been central
to understanding the biology of these cells. However, it is abundantly clear that TFs do not act in isolation and
many TFs may be important inducers or repressors of a T cell differentiation pathway. The biggest challenge to
studying TF network biology is that experimental manipulation of more than 1 factor at a time under controlled
conditions has not been generally feasible, particularly in primary cells in vivo. Therefore, the focus on 1 gene
at a time has been an experimental necessity for decades; the generation of double and triple knockout mice is
excessively time consuming. Therefore, our approach as a group to this serious problem has been focused on
experimental approaches whereby we can modulate and test many genes in parallel for their roles in antiviral T
cell responses in vivo, using custom shRNAmir vector-based approaches. We have established these
systems, and are able to perform genetic screens, in vivo, in primary CD4 or CD8 T cells, probing
differentiation and function. Our projects propose a highly integrated approach to revealing the biology of
regulation and differentiation of T follicular helper (Tfh) CD4 T cells, memory CD4 T cells, CTL CD8 T cells,
circulating memory CD8 T cells, and tissue-resident CD8 and CD4 T cells (Trm). The three PIs have worked
intensively together over the past 5 years to develop important insights into TF biology in T cells. The
interactions are not simply via shared cores, they involve extensive shared experiments and ideas regarding
TFs, CRs, epigenetics, and gene regulation networks. This is most clearly seen in our 2017 Nature paper on
Trm and Runx3. That work is connected to our earlier work together predicting TF regulators of gene
expression in T cells, and our most recent paper together, defining the dominant pioneer factor role of Runx3 in
the earliest steps of effector CD8 T cell differentiation and defining how Runx3 interacts with other TFs that we
have studied, including T-bet, Blimp-1, IRF4, TCF1, and Id2. Our collective experience is that our screens
identify multiple critical factors, more than can be comprehensively studied in the context of a single project.
Therefore, the equally important challenge—and where our Program’s synergy stands out—is narrowing down
the candidate molecules to particular ‘high value’ TFs and CRs that have a major influence on T cell
programming. Our three Projects acquire such data in the orthogonal screens and epistasis experiments
proposed by each Project, which allow us to converge quickly on important targets to study in detail."

We propose an Older Americans Independence Center (OAIC) at Northwestern University. Its mission will be to:
Generate innovative research that will enhance primary care for medically complex, older adults with
multiple chronic conditions (MCC) to achieve optimal health, function, independence and quality of life.
The Northwestern OAIC will catalyze research on: i) identifying modifiable clinical, healthcare system, and
social environmental determinants of chronic disease outcomes, physical and mental health, and quality of life
for older adults with MCC - especially those with frailty; ii) developing novel, practical, and scalable primary care
management strategies that align with patient priorities, improve health outcomes and maintain independence
for this vulnerable, at-risk, older adult population. The specific aims of the Northwestern OAIC are to:
Aim 1 Formalize a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, aging research program dedicated to improving
 healthcare, functional independence, and quality of life for older adults with MCC.
Aim 2 Expand Northwestern training and mentoring activities to develop future leaders in geriatrics and aging
 research who will transform healthcare to meet the needs of older adults with MCC.
Aim 3 Stimulate applied research on the innovative design of primary care models that align with the priorities
 of older adults with MCC through aging-specific research resources and expertise in healthcare system
 & technology design (`Design Core'), patient-reported outcomes measurement (`Measurement Core')
 and quantitative & qualitative data analytics (`Analytics Core').
With strong institutional support and established infrastructure, we will organize internationally-recognized aging
research faculty at Northwestern and establish a formal presence as a collaborative center on aging. Junior
faculty with aging and MCC-related research interests will participate as mentored scientists; our OAIC will help
them establish a successful career trajectory as independent investigators. Three essential Resource Cores
(Design, Measurement, Analytics) will generate new methodological approaches for addressing MCC in primary
care and facilitate designing and testing health system interventions via pilot and developmental projects, and
through the use of an extensive portfolio of ongoing external studies. An Information Dissemination Core will
leverage broad regional and national primary care networks to share findings, proactively seek collaborations,
and find economies of scale in research and training activities among other OAICs and NIA centers.
The Northwestern OAIC will introduce a timely and highly complementary area of focus, while bringing
the greater Chicago community and Illinois into the national Pepper Center network."
10894671,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Mount Sinai OAIC's innovative mission is to stimulate, develop, and fund research directed
at improving the quality of life and independence of older adults with serious illness, their
families, and other caregivers. Over the past 9 years of existence, the OAIC has emerged as a
key contributor in the movement to improve quality of care for the sickest patients in our nation's
healthcare system. We have: 1) created a new generation of geriatric palliative care researchers
who are addressing the most pressing problems of our most vulnerable patients; 2) enhanced
the evidence base for improving quality of life and independence in seriously ill older adults and
their caregivers through innovative and cutting edge research; and 3) created a national network
of geriatric palliative care researchers. The objective of this renewal application is 1) to expand
a comprehensive transdisciplinary research program focused on improving quality of life,
independence, and function and on developing and testing models of improving care for older
adults living with serious illness; 2) to identify, recruit, and train leaders in aging and palliative
care research; 3) to expand a research infrastructure that will support new and ongoing
research in the care of seriously ill older adults; and 4) to develop a research center that bridges
the transdisciplinary specialties of geriatrics and palliative care and that will serve as a model for
research that has not been well addressed by these two specialties.
 We approach the work of advancing research in geriatric palliative care and its translation by
considering the full range of translational research and through a comprehensive framework of
connected and coordinated activities that starts with creating a pipeline of trainees, supporting
their research development, providing infrastructure and resources for research, nurturing and
facilitating collaborative research, and ends with targeted efforts to disseminate the work to
improve the life of older persons and their families. We bring together research resources at
Mount Sinai, engage other experts in the region, and leverage a national network of experts and
trainees through the National Palliative Care Research Center. To amplify the OAIC's impact,
we also propose new innovative initiatives, including the formation of a new Pepper Center
Palliative Care Network and two cross-cutting themes focused on dementia and the often-
neglected and final step of translational research—the adoption of the findings of research into
practice. By strategically leveraging local and national resources and building on other
successful programs, the OAIC proposes to maximize its impact by creating a Center that is
comprehensive in scope, significant in its local impact, and national in its reach."
10900712,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The objectives of the Center for Studies of Host Response to Cancer Therapy are to (1) form a self-sustaining
multidisciplinary research center within the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) to increase the
understanding of mechanisms of side effects of cancer therapy, identify methods for early detection, and develop
strategies to prevent or treat such side effects and (2) help junior investigators with research programs in this
common theme establish themselves as independent scientists. Achieving these goals will create a vibrant,
multidisciplinary yet synergistic research environment. To our knowledge, few research centers focus on cancer
survivorship, and none take the paradigm-shifting approach of proactively addressing treatment-related toxicities
to improve overall cancer treatment outcomes. Specifically, this Center will provide an environment for young
investigators to succeed as independent scientists (Aim 1); strengthen the overall research infrastructure at
UAMS and the Winthrop P. Rockefeller Cancer Institute (Aim 2); and ensure that the Center becomes self-
sustaining (Aim 3). All 6 project leaders recruited to the Center in Phase 1 have built well-funded, productive
research programs and close collaborations with each other and several of the pilot project grantees. In
preparation for Phase 2, we have recruited 4 promising new/early-stage independent investigators. During Phase
1, the Center focused heavily on radiation therapy. To increase the impact and scope of the Center while
retaining its overall theme, project leaders recruited for Phase 2 have a research focus on both radiation and
chemotherapy. To increase the likelihood that project leaders will successfully secure independent extramural
research funding, individualized mentoring and faculty-development plans will be implemented, and support from
an administrative core and 2 research service cores will be integral. To replace project leaders who achieve
independence and graduate from COBRE support, a pipeline of new project leaders is ensured through
institutional support for recruiting junior faculty combined with a structured pilot project program. Strengthening
our interactions with the 5 other COBRE Centers and additional NIH-supported programs that enhance
biomedical research on the UAMS and affiliated campuses will also contribute to establishing the Center as a
self-sustaining research program that is well-integrated in the institution. The Center's progress will be guided
by highly qualified External and Internal Advisory Committees. Strong institutional support combined with active
interest from funding agencies in improving uncomplicated cancer cure rates and the quality of life of cancer
survivors ensures a high likelihood of success for the Center for Studies of Host Response to Cancer Therapy."
10848225,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Overall
Addiction is a chronic relapsing brain disorder resulting from perturbations in neural circuits. Delineating these
circuit perturbations should provide a host of opportunities to develop new therapies for addiction prevention and
treatment. New technologies in neuroscience are revolutionizing our ability to measure and intervene in specified
neural circuits. To take advantage, these technologies should be broadly distributed. We propose to create a
NIDA Center for Neural Circuits in Addiction at the University of Minnesota (UMN) to further develop and
disseminate these new techniques to produce groundbreaking work in addiction neuroscience. Based on our
collective expertise, our strong base of collaborative addiction research and the support provided by our
institution, our group at the UMN is in an excellent position to form this Center. It would comprise four new
Research Cores: 1) The Viral Innovation Core (VIC) will assist investigators in applying state-of-the-art viral
manipulation approaches to their studies of the anatomical, molecular and neural circuit bases of addiction. This
Core will provide expertise for design of custom vectors, including guidance on combinations of AAV serotype,
promoters, and fluorescent tags; 2) The Structural Circuits Core (SCC) will offer state-of-the-art anatomical
mapping of neural circuits involved in addiction. Integrated with the University Imaging Center and UMN
Informatics Institute, SCC will provide automated use of brain clearing technology paired with meso- and micro-
scale imaging of the CNS; 3) The Imaging Cells during Behavior Core (ICBC) will offer a range of imaging
modalities to monitor brain activity in behaving animals across a range of spatial and temporal scales. These
modalities include fiber photometry, head-mounted miniature microscopes (“miniscopes”) and novel wide field-
of-view optical imaging during behavior at both the mesoscopic and cellular levels. 4) The Addiction
Connectome Core (ACC) will create a computational platform to integrate multimodal functional and structural
data to test relationships between exposure to addictive drugs and neural connectivity. Availability of this platform
should enable outside scholars from anywhere in the world to delineate drug-modified connectivity patterns and
addiction-relevant biological variables, facilitating the identification of biomarkers for mental function and
dysfunction. Our Center would provide to the research community: a) Education and training in new technologies;
b) Access to tools, reagents and expertise for data collection and analysis; c) Further development and adoption
of new technologies; d) Catalysis of new collaborations among users; and e) Dissemination of resulting research
and new technologies to the wider addiction research community. The Pilot Project Core will facilitate use of the
Cores for innovative pilot studies and push the envelope in neural circuit research. Under the Center Director’s
leadership, the Administrative Core, with a panel of expert scientific advisors, would coordinate and support the
efforts of the individual Cores. Our goal is for the Center to be a national resource for neural circuit research
technologies that fuels high-impact, collaborative research to address critical knowledge gaps in our field."
10894771,"PPG SUMMARY
The inhibitory receptors PD1 and LAG3 synergize in the regulation of immune tolerance and prevention of
autoimmunity. However, they also limit tumor clearance and sterilizing immunity to chronic viral infections.
PD1/LAG3 mediate T cell intrinsic control, but also modulate the development, homeostasis and function of
regulatory T cells (Tregs). Thus, inhibitory receptors are critical for maintaining immune control but also represent
a major barrier to effective anti-tumor and anti-viral immunity. Our recent studies have highlighted the synergistic
utilization of PD1 and LAG3, in a variety of disease settings including autoimmunity, tumors and chronic viral
infections. Whereas mice lacking either PD1 or LAG3 alone exhibit minimal immunopathology, mice lacking both
PD1 and LAG3 develop lethal systemic autoimmune disease. We have also shown that combinatorial blockade
of PD1 and LAG3 can reinvigorate exhausted T cells in mice with chronic viral infections and induce complete
remission in mice with pre-existing tumors. The primary goal and long-term objective of this PPG is to determine
the relative contribution of, and synergistic interaction between, inhibitory receptors in critical immune
populations. The scope of the program project will focus on the interplay between PD1 and LAG3 in regulating
CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and Tregs in the modulation of tolerance and autoimmunity (Project 1), tumor
immunity (Project 2) and chronic viral infection (Project 3). Our central hypothesis is that “PD1 and LAG3
pathways synergize through cellular and molecular crosstalk leading to both overlapping and unique
mechanisms that collectively regulate CD4+ T conv cell, CD8+ T cell and Treg function in autoimmunity, cancer
and chronic viral infections”. Given that PD1/LAG3 are expressed by all T cell subsets, it is not clear what impact
the loss of PD1/LAG3 has on a particular cell type in a particular disease setting. A major strength of this PPG
is the available of unique tools that will facilitate the ‘surgical’ deletion of PD1 and/or LAG3 from specific T cell
subpopulations constitutively or in a temporally controlled manner. This PPG will be supported by four cores;
Administrative (Core A), Mutant Mouse (Core B), Functional Genomics and Computational Biology (Core C),
and Immunopathology Cores (Core D)."

Dynamics of Colonization and Infection by Multidrug-Resistant Pathogens in Immunocompromised
 and Critically Ill Patients (DYNAMITE) Program.
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in community and hospital-associated pathogens has been named one of the
most pressing public health priorities by the United Nations. Among the most relevant multidrug-resistant
(MDR) bacteria, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), extended spectrum β-lactamase
producing/carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E/CRE) and Clostridiodes difficile are
considered high priority inasmuch as these organisms commonly infect severely ill and immunocompromised
patients, and there is a paucity of therapeutic options to treat infections caused by these bacteria. For each of
these key pathogens, the intestines are the site of initial colonization and, under the influence of broad-
spectrum antimicrobial therapies, these organisms can “dominate” the gastrointestinal tract increasing the risk
of clinical disease. Importantly, it is becoming progressively clear that colonization of the intestines by either
VRE, ESBL-E/CRE, or C. difficile is markedly associated with subsequent colonization by other members of
this group, but whether pathogen-to-pathogen signaling plays a role is not known. Further, data generated from
microbiome-based studies to date has not allowed for clinically impactful interventions due to the imprecise
identification of high-risk patients and it is currently unclear why only a subset of patients, under apparently
similar conditions, develop colonization/disease. Our overarching hypothesis is that patient susceptibility to
gut-derived nosocomial colonization and subsequent infection is critically dependent on functional microbiota-
pathogen interactions that can be detected via a holistic combination of pathogen, host, and commensal
microbiota analyses. The DYNAMITE program (Dynamics of Colonization and Infection by Multidrug-Resistant
Pathogens in Immunocompromised and Critically Ill Patients) seeks to fill these important gaps in knowledge.
Indeed, we have identified keystone microbiota features that are broadly protective against gut-derived
pathogens via previously unappreciated antimicrobial mechanisms suggesting that lack of such organisms may
be a critical factor in determining pathogen colonization and infection. The aims of the program are, i) dissect
the main microbial, clinical and antimicrobial resistance determinants that impact colonization and infection by
VRE, ESBL-E/CRE and C. difficile, ii) evaluate the role of the commensal microbiota in VRE, ESBL-E/CRE
and C. difficile colonization, and iii) define the functional aspects of keystone microbiota and mechanisms of
protection against colonization/infection. Our strong history of multi-institutional collaboration on AMR and
microbiome science with centralized state-of-the art facilities, administrative resources, and access to two
major cohorts of critically ill and immunocompromised patients in the Texas Medical Center, place our team in
a unique and ideal position to achieve the goals. We expect that the findings of our high impact,
complementary projects will provide critical platforms for the development of novel diagnostic, preventive, and
therapeutic approaches to combat gut-derived AMR organisms affecting critically ill individuals."
10869907,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Lung transplantation remains the only available treatment for many patients, who suffer from end-
stage pulmonary disease. Outcomes after lung transplantation, however, continue to be far worse
compared to those after transplantation of other organs. Current immunosuppression for lung
transplant patients are based on protocols that have been developed for patients receiving other
organs. However, such approaches do not take unique immunological features of lungs into
consideration that differ substantially from other commonly transplanted organs. Utilizing new
clinically relevant mouse models of lung transplantation we have uncovered that induction and
maintenance of tolerance to pulmonary grafts is regulated locally through interactions of immune
cells within the graft. Tolerant lung grafts develop tertiary lymphoid organs that are enriched in
immunoregulatory cell populations that maintain a quiescent state. This proposal explores
mechanisms how tolerance is regulated after pulmonary transplantation. We examine pathways
that result in graft failure when the tolerant state is disrupted. Insights gained from this application
will allow for the development of new therapeutic strategies for lung transplant patients."
10861063,"OVERALL PROGRAM PROJECT: ABSTRACT
Cell death pathways have historically been characterized by the proteases that become
activated during cell fate decisions. Apoptosis has been defined by initiator and effector caspase
activation and, largely due to the reagents available; cell death decisions were initially thought to
be binary – caspase-dependent (apoptosis) or caspase-independent (all others). Much like
other binary distinctions – like Th1 versus Th2 T cells or M1 versus M2 macrophages, which
have undergone substantial expansion in the past decade, cell death decisions and their
consequences are now recognized to be much more variables. In fact, even the mechanisms of
cell death have been refined. They are no longer categorized by the proteases which activate
the cascades but rather, by the effector mechanism. Necroptotic cell death is caused by
activation of the pore-forming protein, MLKL. Secondary necrosis is caused by activation of the
pore-forming protein, DFNA5 (Gasdermin E/GSDME), and pyroptosis is caused by activation of
the pore-forming protein, Gasdermin D (GSDMD) This last category of cell death - pyroptosis -
is one of the most immunologically important forms of cell death. Not only does pyroptosis kill
the cell, but also GSDMD activation allows the release of IL-1β. This cytokine is among the most
important in acute and chronic inflammation. Its secretion is implicated in rare genetic
inflammatory diseases such as Familial Mediterranean Fever as well as more common diseases
such as myocardial infarction, Alzheimer's disease, Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis,
Multiple Sclerosis and many others. With the discovery of the inflammasome in 2002 and its
subsequent study, it became clear that the amyloid-like activation of these inflammasome
complexes drove pro-IL-1β cleavage and IL-1β release from the cell, but also pyroptosis.
Missing from this biochemistry, though, was the cell biology underlying IL-1β release. How is IL-
1β recognized by caspases and other proteases? If IL-1β is not released through a secretory
ER-Golgi mechanism, how is trafficked out of the cell? How is this release coordinated with
pyroptosis and other regulated cell death pathways that are operative in different populations of
immune effector cells. This Program Project aims to utilize cell physiology, biochemistry,
structural biology, and mouse and human disease models to unravel these important questions."

This application represents a resubmission of a competing renewal application for a Specialized Program of
Research Excellence (SPORE) in Kidney Cancer from the Kidney Cancer Program of Dana-Farber/Harvard
Cancer Center (DF/HCC). The DF/HCC Kidney Cancer SPORE has been funded for two cycles since 2003.
DF/HCC is comprised of the following institutions: Beth Israel-Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC); Dana-
Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI); Harvard Medical School; Harvard School of Public Health; Brigham and
Women’s Hospital; Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH); and Children’s Hospital of Boston. In addition to
the institutions in the DF/HCC, the Georgetown-Lombardi Cancer Center (GLCC) is collaborating institutions
in this grant. The DF/HCC Kidney Cancer SPORE has its administrative base at the BIDMC. Dr. David
McDermott, who has led the DF/HCC Kidney Cancer Program and SPORE since 2012 is joined as SPORE
Director by Dr. William Kaelin, a laboratory scientist at DFCI and has served with Dr. McDermott as Director
of the SPORE since early 2014. Dr. Kaelin is a world renowned basic and translational investigator with
longstanding interest in renal cancer and a leader within the DF/HCC community. Drs. McDermott and Kaelin
report directly to Dr. Laurie Glimcher, Director of DF/HCC and President of DFCI. The DF/HCC Kidney
Cancer SPORE has a broad and deep talent base and there is extensive institutional commitment. We take
advantage of a large patient population and cutting edge technologies that are available to us as part of
DF/HCC. We propose 3 Projects which address critical problems in kidney cancer and have translational
components. They focus on identifying effective strategies for targeting: HIF2α, the dominant oncogenic
driver of clear-cell RCC (Project 1), resistance mechanisms of standard therapies (Projects 2-3, DRP 17),
novel immune checkpoint pathways (Project 3) and rare kidney tumor types (e.g. NF2 mutated and
translocation RCC, DRP 18 and 17). The projects are supported by three Cores - an Administrative Core, a
Biostatistics and Computational Biology Core, and a Tissue Acquisition, Pathology and Clinical Data Core.
We also have a highly successful Career Development Program that selects talented physician scientists and
mentors them to independence as well as a Developmental Projects Program that generates new ideas for
the SPORE in the future. The existence of the SPORE has provided opportunities and incentives to extend
basic science and clinical research ideas into the translational realm and facilitated the entry of young, as well
as some seasoned, investigators into the kidney cancer field where they have made major contributions."
10867523,"The Overall Objective of the WVU Stroke CoBRE is to decrease morbidity and mortality related
to stroke through improved understanding of pathophysiological mechanism(s) of stroke. We will
accomplish this overall goal by conducting high-quality basic and translational research
addressing the modifiable risk factors, biomarkers, mechanism(s), preventative strategies, acute
and chronic treatments and rehabilitation of stroke. This objective would be met by achieving the
following three Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. Expand the critical mass of funded investigators
conducting stroke recovery research. In Phase II we propose to solidify the commitment of
investigators to stroke research, in part, by providing cutting-edge stroke research core facilities
and services (See Specific Aim 2), generating meaningful preliminary data in support of their grant
applications through funding of five Junior Investigator projects, providing grantsmanship
workshops/activities to improve their grant applications, and expanding the intensive mentoring
program initiated in Phase I of the WVU Stroke CoBRE. Specific Aim 2. Strengthen innovative
scientific cores that support and advance basic and translational stroke research. We propose to
expand the scope and capacity, as well as the user-base of these vital cores. This will be
accomplished by the introduction of new services (e.g., new stroke models; additional behavioral
tests), and provide training sessions for research cores. In addition to the Experimental Stroke
Core (ESC) and the Rodent Behavior Core (RBC), which are proposed for CoBRE funding, we
will develop two additional cores, the Mitochondrial Functional Assessment Core (MFAC) and the
Stroke Tissue Bank. Specific Aim 3. Advance the ongoing development of an independent,
sustainable, multidisciplinary thematic program of research on stroke. The goal of achieving
independences (of CoBRE funding) of the WVU Stroke CoBRE has begun and will continue in
Phase II by the transition to a user-fee based funding of research core services, the independent
funding of research grants that include funding for these core services and support from the WVU
HSC. At the conclusion of Phase II of the WVU Stroke CoBRE, mentored training will have
been provided to engage additional JIs in stroke-related research. We will have addressed the
need for basic and translational research into the causes, acute and subacute treatments and
recovery from stroke by (1) increasing the number of independently funded WVU stroke
researchers, (2) expanding stroke research core services and user numbers, and (3) continuing
the transition to sustain these resources through a user-based funding model for services at WVU."

In this competitive renewal application, the University of Michigan Claude D. Pepper Older Americans
Independence Center (UM Pepper Center), established in 1989, seeks to provide scientific leadership and
innovation for aging research to address the central hypothesis that targeting metabolic and inflammatory
factors as critical mediators of geriatric conditions and outcomes improves physical and cognitive functions of
older adults.
The overarching goal of the UM Pepper Center is to create, enhance and maintain a cohesive intellectual,
technological, and administrative environment to maximize geriatrics research that will promote health and
functional independence in older adults. The UM Pepper Center will pursue its objectives in five Aims. Aim 1)
To support research that addresses the Center’s focus to improve understanding of how metabolic factors and
inflammation determine key health outcomes related to mobility and functional status. Aim 2) To support
translational research on the interaction of metabolic factors and inflammation with age-related diseases and
comorbidities to improve health outcomes related to mobility and functional status. To achieve the aim, the UM
Pepper Center will work closely with other UM programs including the Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health
Research (MICHR), the home of the UM’s Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA). Aim 3) To
provide Resource Cores that support and assist investigator-initiated projects related to the UM Pepper
Center’s research focus. Aim 4) Through its Research Education Core (REC), to strengthen the UM
environment for training of future academic leaders in geriatrics and aging who can conduct research related to
the UM Pepper Center’s research focus. Aim 5) Through its Pilot and Exploratory Studies Core (PESC), to
attract UM faculty to develop new research projects related to the UM Pepper Center’s research focus.
The UM Pepper Center has in place a well-established leadership and administrative structure, a REC, a
PESC, and four RCs: the Human Subjects and Assessment Core (HSAC); the Biomechanics Core (BC); the
Design, Data and Biostatistics Core (DDBC); and the Core Facility for Aged Rodents (CFAR). The REC
features three central elements: 1) a competitive program to select 2 promising UM junior faculty per year to
conduct research relevant to the UM Pepper Center’s research and guarantee 50% effort for research career
development; 2) a nationally recognized research training program for junior faculty engaged in such research,
and 3) a Mentorship Program that enhances opportunities for junior faculty members to work closely with one
or more UM senior investigators. The PESC will fund 5 or more pilot projects per year by leveraging OAIC
funding with multiple other UM institutional resources. The RC’s will support multiple externally funded projects,

10876431,"Project Summary
The goal of this Center of Biomedical Research Excellence is to continue our efforts to develop molecular
approaches for probing biology, to discover and apply new chemical biology tools for the study of biological
pathways associated with disease, and to develop computational approaches for understanding small
molecule interactions with complex macromolecular targets. With core strengths in synthesis, biochemistry,
engineering and biology, our scientific team will develop new chemical biology tools for understanding the
cellular and molecular mechanisms that bacterial pathogens use to survive and replicate inside host cells, new
chemical tools and nucleotide analogs to understand the regulation of mRNA demethylation by a ‘methyl
eraser’ enzyme and its dysregulation in human cancer, molecularly-defined nanoparticle adjuvants that yield
specific immune responses in the lung to advance inhalable vaccine development, and computational
approaches to elucidate the mechanisms by which small molecules regulate the structure and function of virus
capsids.
COBRE funding will be used to recruit two new faculty members who will complement the existing strengths of
our center, which will be expanded through competitive pilot grants. In years 4 and 5 of the COBRE, five two-
year replacement projects will be funded. Collaboration and resource sharing in the Delaware and national
IDeA network will be critical for maximizing our research capacity, core facilities and mentoring network. In
Phase II, this COBRE continue to develop unique core facilities that facilitates high throughput synthesis,
purification, screening and analysis of chemical probes. Building on the infrastructure established in Phase I,
we will support a core facility in Analytical Chemistry, which will provide support for critical core facilities in
mass spectrometry, solution NMR and kinetic analysis. The center will also support a Synthesis and Discovery
core facility, which will provide custom synthesis services and instrumentation and infrastructure for small
molecule synthesis, high throughput catalyst discovery, parallel synthesis, computation and microscopy."
10898677,"A core tenet of the geroscience concept is that multiple human diseases arise from aging itself. Thus, the
central theme of the San Antonio (SA) Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center (OAIC)
is translational geroscience – moving research on the basic biology of aging from the laboratory bench to the
clinic, with the overarching goal of promoting healthy aging and developing desperately needed treatments,
mainly pharmacological, for aging-related diseases. This goal is achieved through the following Aims:
 1) Expand the knowledge base in translational geroscience by catalyzing transformative research; 2) Create
a cadre of multidisciplinary early-stage investigators with customized expertise in translational geroscience; 3)
Serve as a resource and partner to investigators from other OAICs and institutions; and 4) Provide intellectual
leadership, disseminate knowledge, and stimulate discussion on translational geroscience-related themes.
 The SA OAIC achieves these Aims through a Leadership and Administrative Core (LAC) that directs
operations and sponsors several enrichment and dissemination activities; a Pilot and Exploratory Studies Core
(PESC) that provides merit-based support for rigorously designed studies; a Research Education Component
(REC) that expands a greatly needed cadre of uniquely qualified scientists cross-trained in aging biology and
translational geroscience; a Pre-Clinical Research Core (RC1) which supports research in marmoset monkeys;
a Clinical Research and Pharmacology Core (RC2) that delivers comprehensive trial support for
recruitment/retention, assessments, pharmacology, and data management; and a Trial Design and Integrative
Informatics Core (RC3) that provides comprehensive study design, biostatistics and informatics services.
 During the ~4 years since its funding, the SA OAIC supported 46 PIs, performing transformative translational
geroscience-focused research in essentially all pillars/hallmarks of aging. For example, RC1 is conducting the
only known lifespan and healthspan study on mTOR inhibitors in nonhuman primates. RC2 and RC3 carried out
the first trial on rapamycin to examine immune and cognitive effects in healthy older adults and performed the
first-in-man studies on senolytics. The OAIC supported 10 Scholars who are making transformative discoveries
(e.g. first demonstration of cellular senescence as a key mediator of Alzheimer's pathology) and receiving highly
competitive career development awards from the NIA/AFAR (Beeson, Irene Diamond) and the VA.
 The SA OAIC is built on a unique foundation provided by UTHSCSA's exceptional and tightly integrated
resources: a Nathan Shock Center, a site of the Interventions Testing Program (ITP), a GRECC, a T32 Training
Grant on Geroscience, and a robust Barshop Institute that unites aging research at UTHSCSA. We are the only
OAIC with all of these synergistic components available. In addition, the SA OAIC receives unparalleled
institutional commitment (~$600,000/year), including a new ~$100M 109,000 sq. ft. building – specific for the
Barshop Institute – that will house the OAIC, Shock Center, and the ITP in a centrally located facility."

Despite the availability of therapy, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the major infectious killer of adults.
Finding more effective therapeutic strategies will require a better understanding of the fundamental biology of
bacterial growth, metabolism and interaction with the host. This program proposes to understand key pathways
in Mtb biology using advanced genetic and biochemical methods, with a particular focus on complex
pathways important in adaptation to disease-relevant stressors. “Pathways” is defined broadly, including
biochemical, structural and genetic interactions. In many cases, traditional genetic approaches to discover and
understand these pathways are limited, but many of the most critical aspects of Mtb biology are mediated by
such complex genetic mechanisms. This program will leverage new methodology and resources that the
collaborators have developed in the last few years, to discover the constituents of key pathways, attribute
functions to new pathways, and understand the mechanisms which underlie the ability of bacteria to survive and
grow under a variety of conditions, focusing on those encountered during infection. They will also take advantage
of the close collaborations among the investigators who have worked well together for several years. The work
will be organized into four projects and four cores, but considerable crossover is expected, which will enrich each
component.
Project 1. Metabolic adaptations required for growth and virulence of Mtb at acidic pH.
Project 2. Acquisition, synthesis and importance of biotin in Mtb.
Project 3. Defining the RNA processing and degradation pathways of Mtb.
Project 4. Defining cell division pathways in Mtb.
Core A. Metabolomics and lipidomics.
Core B. Biochemistry and enzymology.
Core C. Bioinformatics and data sharing.
Core D. Administration.
All of this work will be facilitated by a highly collaborative group of investigators, almost all of whom have worked
together for many years on a large variety of projects. Both project and core investigators will serve as full-
fledged intellectual contributors, enabling the team to bring a variety of approaches and thinking to bear on
complex biological systems."
10868755,"OVERALL – SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Organ transplantation remains a mainstay therapeutic strategy for patients with end organ diseases. One of
the highest unmet needs to improve long-term transplant outcomes is devising more effective immune
modulation. This requires innovative mechanistic studies of transplant alloimmunity. The lymph node (LN) is
the quintessential organ of alloimmunity. While the recognition of alloantigens in the LN is fundamental to the
generation of alloreactive T cells, our groups also have shown that the LN plays an important role in
alloimmune-regulation and Treg-mediated tolerance. These multifaceted functions rest on the nature of LNs as
extremely specialized organs with unique microvasculature, stromal fibers, and stromal cells (referred to as
fibroblastic reticular cells [FRCs]). Our overarching hypothesis is that manipulating the microenvironment of
LNs will provide a unique opportunity to direct the alloimmune reaction towards an anti-inflammatory tolerance
response. Our major goals are to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern the
microanatomical adaptation of the LN during immune activation or tolerance induction, and to develop highly
innovative therapeutic strategies that promote a regulatory LN microenvironment and result in immune
tolerance. This PPG sets forth a platform for connecting two teams (Drs. Abdi and Bromberg) with
complementary skills and expertise in LN alloimmune-biology. Project 1 will test the hypothesis that
sustained activation of FRCs of the LN during alloimmunity will result in FRC transformation to proinflammatory
myofibroblasts creating an inflammatory milieu within the LN, which would further promote alloimmunity. Our
corollary hypothesis is that restoration of the function of FRCs and microanatomy of the LNs will enhance
their immunoregulatory function and promote tolerance. Aim 1 will examine the role of the HVEM/LIGHT
pathway in the differentiation of FRCs into proinflammatory myofibroblasts, thereby creating an inflammatory
milieu within the LN microenvironment and promoting transplant immunity. Aim 2 will investigate the
mechanisms by which fibrotic FRCs promote a pro-inflammatory response in the LN. Aim 3 will reprogram the
stroma of LNs via FRC delivery or LN-targeted delivery of senescence inhibitors to further promote alloimmune
tolerance. Project 2 will test the hypothesis that FRCs regulate the LN laminin α4:α5 (LAMA4/LAMA5) ratio
and control the fate of the immune response. Aim 1 will define the role of stromal cells in controlling the
balance of LAMA4 and LAMA5. Aim 2 will define the role of LTβR as a key pathway in regulating the formation
of LAMA5. Aim 3 will use targeted delivery of anti-CD40L and anti-LAMA5 mAbs to the LN to promote
tolerance. An Administrative Core (Core A) and Nanoparticle and FRC Core (Core B) will provide the
infrastructure and resources to support these two projects. The ultimate goal of these well-integrated and
highly synergistic Projects and Cores is to generate transformative mechanistic data, which will lay the
groundwork for developing highly targeted and innovative therapeutic strategies for transplantation."

 The integrated hypothesis of this Program proposal is that age-associated cellular and molecular features
of the mouse thymus microenvironment, mirrored by similar features in the human thymus, play a major role in
shaping the distinct functional potential of T cells that emigrate from the thymus during the perinatal versus
juvenile periods. Currently, there is little information in mice, and even less in humans, on changes in the
composition and function of thymic epithelial cells (TECs), hematopoietic antigen presenting cells (HAPCs), and
other stromal cell subsets during this transition. Given that T cells with effector and regulatory functions are vital
for newborn health, the Program research objectives are to: 1) identify changes in the composition and
organization of TECs, HAPCs and other thymus stromal cells over the perinatal to juvenile transition in both mice
and humans; 2) map transcriptional changes in these cellular subsets that regulate their proliferation,
differentiation, function and cross-talk; and 3) determine how such changes impact the ability of the perinatal
thymic environment to generate T cells with distinct functional capabilities.
 The Program is structured to use scRNA-seq and multiplex imaging to collaboratively identify candidate cell
populations and molecular mechanisms underlying functionally significant changes in mouse and human thymus
microenvironments across the perinatal to juvenile transition. In the discovery phase, RPs will generate scRNA-
seq datasets of TECs (RP1), stromal cells (RP2) and HAPCs (RP3) from mouse and human (Core C) thymus.
These datasets will be analyzed by Core B to identify cellular and molecular candidates. In the prioritization
phase, RPs will determine which candidates are conserved across species with Core B. RPs will then collaborate
to use multiplex imaging to visualize changes in location and/or interactions of these candidates during the
transition that may mediate important biological functions. Both species conservation and imaging results will
provide a rationale to prioritize cell subsets and molecular pathways for functional testing. In the testing phase,
each RP will assess novel, as well as previously identified candidates, for functional significance according to
Project specific goals. Collectively, these parallel scRNA-seq and imaging experiments in the three RPs will
synergize to: 1) identify changes in the transcriptional profiles, cellular composition and organization of the
thymus microenvironment over the perinatal to juvenile transition in both mice and humans; and 2) enable us to
test which changes regulate proliferation, differentiation, and function of these subsets across the transition with
downstream consequences for perinatal immune function. Program components are:
RP1 (Richie): Molecular mechanisms controlling TEC dynamics and lineage hierarchies in the perinatal thymus
RP2 (Manley): The role of Foxn1 in controlling the transition from thymus expansion to homeostasis
RP3 (Ehrlich): Differential contribution of thymic APCs to central tolerance during the perinatal to adult transition

10881796,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common primary malignant brain tumor, remains uniformly lethal despite
aggressive therapies. Epidemiological data demonstrate an increased incidence of cancer in males across
many tumors including GBM, genomic analyses have identified sex-specific molecular alterations, and recent
reports demonstrate that women with GBM experience longer survival. Due in part to a lack mechanistic
understanding behind these outcomes, differences between sexes are not accounted for in the majority of
experimental studies, are not considered in the treatment of GBM, and are not accommodated in
clinical trial design. To fill this knowledge gap, we propose this Program Project Grant (P01) with the long-
term goal of delineating actionable sex-based differences in GBM. This P01 integrates analyses at the
molecular and cellular levels to identify and exploit sex-specific molecular mechanisms that underlie the
increased incidence of GBM for males and better prognosis for females. This multi-disciplinary project involves
established investigators with complementary expertise and a strong collaborative history. Our published
observations of differences between males and females in incidence and outcome, genetic risk, and oncogenic
pathways have now coalesced to build this P01 and uniquely position us to reveal sex-specific mechanisms
that inform GBM patient prognosis and serve as the foundation for sex-specific therapies. We will test the
central hypothesis that the confluence of sex differences in tumor cells (intrinsic) and the
microenvironment (extrinsic) emerging from oncogenic events (genetic) and normal sexual
differentiation (epigenetic) underlies mechanistic differences in gliomagenesis and disease outcome.
This hypothesis will be addressed via three synergistic projects and supported by three enabling cores.
Project 1, led by Dr. Joshua Rubin, will interrogate distinct male and female epigenetic mechanisms that
impact transformation and treatment response. Project 2, led by Dr. James Connor, will interrogate the
mechanisms by which sex-specific microenvironmental interactions, including differences in iron metabolism
(tumor and host), microglia, and macrophages, alter the dynamics of GBM growth. Project 3, led by Dr. Justin
Lathia, will interrogate sex-specific mechanisms of microglia activation and their impact on GBM growth.
These projects will be supported by three integrated cores offering: i) administrative, ii)
biostatistical/bioinformatics assistance, and iii) state-of-the-art mouse and human GBM models led by Drs. Jill
Barnholtz-Sloan, Michael Berens, and Justin Lathia. This P01 is part of our long-term goal to identify sex-
specific mechanisms that drive GBM and can be leveraged for future therapies that move beyond using the
same treatments for all GBM patients to tailoring treatments to the unique vulnerabilities of male versus female
patients with GBM."
10876966,"Project Summary/Abstract
This Proposal describes the existing and proposed future activities of a consortium of three research groups in
the Boston, MA area whose research has been focused over the past two decades on the pathogenesis of
human breast cancer. All three current Project Leaders and the Pathology Core have worked together in a prior
P01 led by Dr. Robert Weinberg (Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA) for 21 years.
As such, the proposed Team has a long history of productive collaborative projects and well-established
mechanisms in place to facilitate interactions. The primary focus of the three research groups is to improve our
understanding of mechanisms of resistance to currently used therapies and to identify and characterize new
therapeutic targets and combination therapies with the goal of clinical translation of the Program's preclinical
findings; indeed, some of our findings have already inspired the design of FDA-approved therapeutics with
several clinical trials in progress. The interactions between the Leaders and trainees of the component Groups
is driven by convening monthly research meetings throughout the academic year and a single research retreat
in Western Massachusetts, during which trainees in the participating laboratories meet and present the details
of their respective research findings. The productivity of this consortium depends on the complementary research
interests and experimental approaches of the component Groups. The participating Groups address therapeutic
resistance and novel vulnerabilities in breast cancer from various perspectives, beginning with the defining
molecular mechanisms underlying heterogeneity in cellular responses to growth regulatory signals and
dissecting epigenetic and transcriptomic heterogeneity in therapeutic resistance and in driving the outgrowth of
distant metastases. The respective research emphases of the participating Project Groups are highly
complementary and integrated. This complementarity is manifested through repeated cross-fertilization at the
conceptual level, the sharing of reagents generated by one Project with others, complementary technologies,
and successful joint publications."
10880420,"Overall Abstract
Our Program Project focuses on mechanistic understanding of the beneficial and harmful effects of red blood
cell (RBC) transfusions in patients with hemoglobinopathies. Increasing evidence suggest that free hemoglobin
and heme play central roles in many aspects of the pathophysiology of hemolytic anemias, especially in SCD,
causing vascular endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Our Team has shown that innate
and key humoral immune cells and hematopoietic niche cells are sensitive to the effects hemolysis and that
heme-sensing mechanisms are key to the response to transfusions. The overall working hypothesis of this PPG
is that heme overload leads to altered immune system response and a dysregulated bone marrow niche.
We further posit that effectiveness of transfusions in hemolytic disorders depends on their ability to switch the
proinflammatory to an anti-inflammatory environment. Building on highly inter-related and synergistic research
projects led by a group of multidisciplinary local experts, including a highly promising ESI, we will interrogate the
impact of hemolysis and outcome of transfusions on complications associated with SCD, ranging from
alloimmunization (Project 1) and infections of hemoparasites (Project 2) to ACS (Project 3) and potentially
affecting hematopoietic transplant outcomes (Project 4). Specifically, we will probe heme pathways specifically
in B and T cells during transfusions to test the hypothesis that hemolysis directly affects humoral immune
response to transfusions and that altered DOCK8/ROS/HO-1 heme pathways dictate alloimmunization risk and
even bystander hemolysis associated with life-threatening delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (Project 1).
We will examine mechanisms of bystander hemolysis in hemoparasite infections and test the hypothesis that
the switch from anti- to proinflammatory states in response to hemolysis and exacerbation of dysregulated
erythropoiesis may underlie the exaggerated hyperhemolytic state (Project 2). Building on our data on
modulation of innate immune response by hemolysis, we will determine the relevance of heme-induced
inflammatory macrophage in the development of the debilitating sickle acute chest syndrome and whether
transfusion outcomes are dependent on an anti-inflammatory metabolic switch in macrophages (Project 3). We
will also test the hypothesis that the proinflammatory effects of free heme leads to dysfunction of the bone marrow
hematopoietic niche and hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, which can be alleviated by transfusions (Project
4). An Administrative Core will facilitate communication and integrate scientific goals and assure that high
scientific productivity standards are maintained. The Human Subject Core will provide clinically annotated
biological samples as well as clinically based insights to facilitate and enhance the clinical applicability of the
findings emerging from this Program Project. We believe that the proposed Projects are highly interactive and
that advances developed within each will have great value to other Projects. We further believe that through a
PPG mechanism our Program will achieve a comprehensive mechanistic understanding how transfusions impact
key heme pathways in hemoglobinopathies will provide the necessary framework for optimization of transfusion
management and support for these highly vulnerable patient population."
10886076,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Overall Center
The Center for Translational and Prevention Science (CTAPS; P20 MH068666, P30 DA027827) has been
funded continuously since 2003 to advance next-generation basic and preventive investigations of risk,
resilience, and drug use among African American young people living in resource poor communities in the
southeastern US. CTAPS has pioneered research demonstrating how exposures to economic and social
adversity promote drug use through their effects on neurobiological and peripheral systems. Of particular
importance, research sponsored by CTAPS also has demonstrated the promise of family-centered drug use
prevention programming in shielding young people from these neurobiological risks. At present, transformative
progress in the prevention of addictive behavior among populations exposed to chronic stress has been
hampered significantly by the lack of (a) integrative theoretical frameworks that generate hypotheses regarding
the risk and resilience mechanisms that connect social adversity to addictive behavior and cardiometabolic risk,
(b) infrastructures that can collect model driven data on multiple neurocognitive, peripheral biological, and
behavioral systems associated with chronic stress, and (c) transdisciplinary teams that can integrate these data
into the design and evaluation of prevention programs. The theoretical framework of the proposed P50
Research Center of Excellence is a next generation, neuroimmune network (NIN) model that CTAPS scientists
developed to better describe the ways in which exposure to social adversity predispose young people to the
onset and escalation of diverse forms of addictive behaviors. The NIN model specifies stress-induced
alterations in the transactions between peripheral inflammation and neurocognitive systems that subserve
emotion regulation in the development of addictive behavior vulnerability. As a P50 Center, we propose to build
on and expand CTAPS’ pioneering work on (a) the biological and neurocognitive contributors to addictive
behaviors that drive many drug use and health disparities African Americans’ experience and (b) the potential
of family-centered prevention programming to ameliorate the influence of growing up in chronically stressful
contexts. We will leverage an established team of investigators from diverse disciplines and an established
infrastructure for testing transdisciplinary hypotheses. This infrastructure includes efficient, established
pipelines connecting P50 research project (RP) and pilot study investigators to intellectual resources, wet labs,
a state-of-the-science imaging facility, and a world class platform for processing imaging data. We will
implement three innovative, thematically integrated RPs. RPs, innovative pilot projects, an expanded national
resource system, and investigator development activities will be supported through our infrastructure system
composed of a Research Support Core, an Administrative Core, and a Pilot Core. CTAPS activities will have
wide-reaching implications for research, practice, and prevention concerning drug use and cardiometabolic risk
in low-income and ethnic minority communities.

10884172,"Signaling Aberrations and Cerebral Cavernous Malformations Pathogenesis. In the first cycle of this program project our collaborative group has made significant discoveries concerning CCM pathogenesis. In this renewal we will follow up these discoveries towards a scientifically based therapy. Recent data from multiple laboratories in our program converge on a model in which somatically mutated, CCM-deficient endothelial cells poison the peri-lesional environment to recruit non-deficient cells into the growing lesion. We will investigate the molecular and cellular basis for this non-cell autonomous pathological mechanism, including single-cell genomic and transcriptomic analyses in mouse and human lesions and mechanistic studies in mouse models. We have also discovered that endothelial cells within murine and human CCMs express markedly increased levels of thrombomodulin and endothelial protein C receptor which leads to activation of endogenous anti-coagulant protein C. This discovery provides a new target for lesional hemorrhage, the most clinically significant phenotype associated with CCM. Importantly, to enable these and other studies we have generated new, more robust CCM mouse models that exhibit both rapid lesion growth and lesional hemorrhage. We have also identified an unexpected and novel signaling aberration involved in CCM growth – activation of PI3 kinase – a target with existing drugs and with others under development. We will investigate the role of PI3 kinase in CCM lesion growth and its inhibition as a potential therapy. In parallel, we will search for somatic mutations in other genes that might enable repurposing of other existing drugs for CCM therapy. By capitalizing on our successes over the past four years, our renewal is designed to move from discovery, to mechanism, and then on to investigation of therapies for CCM disease."
10903747,"OVERALL PROGRAM SUMMARY
One of the most significant challenges for understanding genetic control of blood pressure (BP) is that the vast
majority of BP-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in humans are located in noncoding
regions of DNA. Many of these noncoding SNPs are located in haplotype regions thousands of base pairs
away from any protein-coding gene and their effects on BP cannot be explained by any currently known coding
or other functional sequence variant, making it nearly impossible to link these noncoding SNPs to genes or
physiological pathways that regulate BP based on genomic sequence. Understanding the effect of intergenic
noncoding SNPs on gene expression and the underlying mechanisms is a major challenge not just for BP and
hypertension research, but for research on nearly all complex traits and common diseases.
 The goal of this PPG proposal is to begin to address this major challenge and test the overall
hypothesis that noncoding SNPs associated with human BP but located far from any protein-coding
gene regulate gene expression in specific BP relevant cell types through epigenetic mechanisms and
these mechanisms can influence BP. We have developed three projects that each address one aspect of
this overall hypothesis. Project 1 will use precision genome editing to identify the effect of specific BP-
associated noncoding SNPs on gene expression in BP-relevant human cell types. Project 2 will test the
hypothesis that BP-associated noncoding SNPs influence the expression of BP-relevant genes through
epigenetic mechanisms including chromatin looping, enhancer function and noncoding RNA in human cells
and tissues. Project 3 will take this line of research to animal models in vivo to test directly the novel
hypothesis that chromatin conformation plays a role in BP regulation. The three projects will interact with, and
inform, each other extensively and, together, will achieve the overall goal of the program. All three projects will
rely on Core A for administrative support and Core B for sequencing coordination and data analysis.
 We have published at least 16 papers in the last few years that provide direct support for key aspects of
the conceptual validity and technical feasibility of this PPG. In addition, we have obtained a large amount of
preliminary data to further support the feasibility of the wide range of sophisticated and new technologies that
we will use and the validity of proposed novel hypotheses. This PPG represents a fundamentally new direction
for hypertension research. It will establish several novel approaches and technologies, generate unique and
extensive datasets, and provide new biological insights, all of which will help to advance genetic and epigenetic
research in hypertension and other disease areas."
10840455,"OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY
This competitive renewal application (P01CA100730) seeks funds to continue our highly integrated studies of
retrovirus models to elucidate cellular mechanisms of lymphocyte transformation and associated
lymphoproliferative disease. Infection of CD4+ T-cells with the human retrovirus, human T-cell leukemia virus
type 1 (HTLV-1), induces their immortalization and enables those cells to accumulate genetic mutations leading
to the malignant cancer, adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). The advantage of the HTLV-1 model to study
leukemogenesis is the rapid induction of T-cell immortalization brought about by the viral infection. This model
of leukemogenesis allows careful examination of the biologic changes and response patterns of virus infected
preneoplastic cells while under the influence of cellular and viral factors that control and perhaps promote
progression to cancer. In the previous funding period, we made substantial advances in our understanding of:
1) how retrovirus accessory proteins contribute to cell immortalization; 2) how retroviruses cause broad cellular
changes that position infected cells to progress to a metastatic cancer; 3) and how ATL cells contribute to
paraneoplastic disease syndromes, and can be targeted for anticancer therapy. In the next funding period, the
overall theme of the Program Project is to continue our studies with HTLV-1 leukemia model with a focus on
discovering how key viral, cellular and microenvironmental factors work in concert to promote T-cell cancer. We
now recognize three interrelated areas of study that are major gaps in our understanding of the pathogenesis of
HTLV-1-associated T-cell leukemogenesis: 1) Mechanism of action of HTLV-1 multifunctional hbz mRNA and
HBZ protein; 2) The effect of HTLV-1 CTCF-BS (11-zinc finger CCCTC factor-binding site) on T-cell
immortalization, hbz expression, establishment of latency and contribution to the transition to ATL, and; 3)
Microenvironmental factors that contribute to the survival and expansion of HTLV-1-infected T-cells and their
progression to ATL."
10977256,"OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY
This competitive renewal application (P01CA100730) seeks funds to continue our highly integrated studies of
retrovirus models to elucidate cellular mechanisms of lymphocyte transformation and associated
lymphoproliferative disease. Infection of CD4+ T-cells with the human retrovirus, human T-cell leukemia virus
type 1 (HTLV-1), induces their immortalization and enables those cells to accumulate genetic mutations leading
to the malignant cancer, adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). The advantage of the HTLV-1 model to study
leukemogenesis is the rapid induction of T-cell immortalization brought about by the viral infection. This model
of leukemogenesis allows careful examination of the biologic changes and response patterns of virus infected
preneoplastic cells while under the influence of cellular and viral factors that control and perhaps promote
progression to cancer. In the previous funding period, we made substantial advances in our understanding of:
1) how retrovirus accessory proteins contribute to cell immortalization; 2) how retroviruses cause broad cellular
changes that position infected cells to progress to a metastatic cancer; 3) and how ATL cells contribute to
paraneoplastic disease syndromes, and can be targeted for anticancer therapy. In the next funding period, the
overall theme of the Program Project is to continue our studies with HTLV-1 leukemia model with a focus on
discovering how key viral, cellular and microenvironmental factors work in concert to promote T-cell cancer. We
now recognize three interrelated areas of study that are major gaps in our understanding of the pathogenesis of
HTLV-1-associated T-cell leukemogenesis: 1) Mechanism of action of HTLV-1 multifunctional hbz mRNA and
HBZ protein; 2) The effect of HTLV-1 CTCF-BS (11-zinc finger CCCTC factor-binding site) on T-cell
immortalization, hbz expression, establishment of latency and contribution to the transition to ATL, and; 3)
Microenvironmental factors that contribute to the survival and expansion of HTLV-1-infected T-cells and their
progression to ATL."

The Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center (HICCC) was designated as a National Cancer Institute (NCI)
Cancer Center in 1972 and gained comprehensive status in 1979. The HICCC is the critical driver of cancer
scientific research, clinical trials, innovative patient care, cancer education and training and community outreach
at Columbia University’s Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH). During
the current project period (2014-present), CUIMC and NYPH committed $415M for the following: (1) new
research initiatives in basic, translational, clinical and population sciences with >50 strategic faculty recruitments;
(2) new and expanded facilities for laboratory research, dry bench research and clinical activities; (3) major
faculty recruitments; and, (4) support of the HICCC’s administrative core. A major aspect was the recruitment
of Anil K. Rustgi, MD as the HICCC Director in late 2018. Rustgi has the unequivocal authority over cancer
research space and cancer care facilities and accompanying substantial resources through the transformative
Irving Family Trust Gift, further reinforced through his dual roles as Associate Dean of Oncology (CUIMC) and
Chief of Cancer Services (NYPH). Over this project period, there was a greater focus upon transdisciplinary
cross-cutting scientific themes that catalyzed the restructuring of the scientific research programs encompassing
175 members from 34 Departments and six Schools: Cancer Genomics and Epigenomics; Tumor Biology and
Microenvironment; Precision Oncology and Systems Biology; and, Cancer Population Science. Importantly,
Rustgi created units dedicated to Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) and Cancer Research Career
Enhancement (CRCE) and enhanced the 12 Shared Resources. The Research Programs engendered impactful
science with 3,399 publications of which 626 were intra-programmatic and 456 were inter-programmatic. Total
NCI funding is $26M and cancer-relevant funding is $92M. The HICCC is requesting CCSG support of $4.1M
per year (total DC) for the next project period."
10892086,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We are proposing a NIDA Research Center of Excellence (P50) entitled, Center for Adolescent Reward,
Rhythms and Sleep (CARRS). Adolescence is a vulnerable time for substance abuse. This risk reflects the
heightened reward system of adolescence, which is found regardless of cultural upbringing or home
environment, relative to both adults and children. In addition, genetic, social and environmental factors influence
the amount of sleep and circadian rhythm misalignment experienced by the adolescent brain. The goal of
CARRS is to integrate human and rodent studies to understand the impact of adolescent sleep and circadian
rhythm changes (both biologically and environmentally induced) on reward circuitry and substance use (SU)-
relevant outcomes. We will use experimental manipulations to further examine how sleep and circadian rhythms
affect reward function and SU-related outcomes, with the ultimate goal of developing novel prevention or
intervention strategies. Late sleep timing, short sleep duration and circadian misalignment are associated with
increased substance use in teenagers and young adults. The central hypothesis of the Center is that adolescent
development acts on underlying sleep and circadian traits to modify homeostatic sleep drive, circadian phase,
and circadian alignment, which in turn impact cortico-limbic functions critical to substance use risk (e.g., reward
and cognitive control). We further hypothesize that specific manipulations of sleep and circadian rhythms during
adolescence will affect reward responsivity and cognitive control in either positive or negative directions. These
manipulations will provide experimental support for our model, and proof of concept for novel clinical
interventions to reduce the risk of substance use disorders. In turn, abuse of drugs will also impact the circadian,
reward and sleep systems, creating a vicious cycle. Interventions that help stabilize the circadian and sleep
systems, or reduce the damage done by these disruptions, may be protective against substance abuse in
vulnerable individuals. The goals of the center are to 1) Determine the role of sleep and circadian rhythms in
reward sensitivity and substance use (SU) in adolescence. 2) Conduct translational research aimed at the
development of interventions to reduce risk in at-risk individuals. 3) Partner with other Centers and the addiction
research community to inform and complement ongoing research. 4) Provide training and education on sleep,
circadian rhythms, and substance use."
10843818,"Overall – PROJECT SUMMARY
Decades of research have generated knowledge and tools with the potential to prevent all new HIV infections,
to ultimately end the HIV epidemic in the United States and worldwide, and to improve the lives of people living
with HIV. To date, reality has fallen short of these goals, in part due to pressing unmet needs. The Tennessee
Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) is located in the Southeastern United States, the region with the greatest
number of new HIV infections, and of persons living with HIV. This CFAR was established in 2015, under the
leadership of Prof. Simon Mallal, as a three-way partnership between a research-intensive medical institution
(Vanderbilt University Medical Center, VUMC), a historically black medical college (Meharry Medical College,
MMC), and an academically engaged state health department (Tennessee Department of Health, TDH). This
partnership has fostered collaborations that would be unimaginable without CFAR. For example, results of an
analysis by VUMC and MMC investigators using TDH surveillance data has affected statewide public policy and
law regarding needle exchange, reducing the likelihood of a potentially devastating HIV outbreak in rural
Tennessee. To end the epidemic, it is becoming increasingly important to pursue community-engaged research,
to include both people living with HIV and those at high risk. Toward this end, this CFAR has newly partnered
with a fourth institution, Nashville CARES, a sophisticated community-based organization with a 25-year
exclusive focus on people living with HIV and those at high risk. Through this four-way partnership, our vision is
to have transformative, local and global translational impact. Guided by this vision, our mission is to coordinate
the complementary institutional and community strengths and resources of VUMC, MMC, TDH and CARES to
most effectively reduce the burden of HIV/AIDS and generalize these benefits nationally and globally. Work of
this CFAR aligns with National Institutes of Health high priorities for NIH/AIDS research. To fulfill our mission,
this CFAR will pursue four specific aims: 1) To support multidisciplinary HIV research that leverages the highly
collaborative local environment to build impactful team science among the four institutions of the CFAR; 2) To
nurture and support career development of junior investigators, so as to grow the number and diversity of the
next generation of HIV researchers; 3) To specifically enable HIV research opportunities for MMC investigators,
to include engagement with investigators and resources across the CFAR, and leveraging team science; and 4)
To continue to grow a broad emphasis on HIV-focused community-engaged research that pervades the CFAR,
and with a focus on ending the epidemic."
10982632,"In the United States, one in ten babies is born prematurely. The earlier in pregnancy a baby is born, the more
likely s/he will have an extended hospital stay, as well as serious health complications such as respiratory
distress syndrome, necrotizing enterocolitis, vision problems and infection. Women who have had a previous
premature birth and women diagnosed with a short cervix in mid pregnancy are at high risk for preterm birth, and
are typically prescribed a progesterone product to reduce this risk. There are currently only two general
progesterone products available to women at risk for pre-term birth, each having drawbacks associated with
variable efficacy and ease of use. Moreover, none of the available progesterone products have received approval
from the Federal Drug Administration for use in pregnant women diagnosed with a short cervix. To improve
treatment options for women having one or both clinical risk factors for a preterm birth, Daré Bioscience is
advancing the development of a novel intravaginal ring, called DARE-FRT1. DARE-FRT1 offers women a
patient-friendly, extended-release progesterone product that delivers a relatively constant level of the drug in
close proximity to the cervix, where progesterone action regulates inflammation, contractility, and other activities
associated with labor. An in vivo preclinical study demonstrated that DARE-FRT1 slowly releases bioidentical
progesterone over at least 14 days. Building on these strong foundational studies we aim to (i) complete IND-
enabling in vitro DARE-FRT1 product stability studies to ensure consistent and product and (ii) evaluate the
comparative pharmacokinetics of different DARE-FRT1 doses in a first-in-human clinical study. Thus, DARE-
FRT1 holds promise to be the first simple, safe, and convenient method to extend the term of gestation in women
at high risk for preterm birth, improving overall health outcomes, and reducing infant mortality."
10709421,"Central sensitivity syndromes (CSS), including Fibromyalgia (FM), are common and difficult to treat disorders.
The diagnosis of FM depends on the presence of chronic widespread pain along with concurrent central
sensitivity symptoms and absence of an alternative diagnosis. The gold standard for identification of this
neurologic disorder is positive affirmation of diagnosis by a rheumatologist. FM makes up a high percentage of
chronic non-malignant pain conditions which are a major burden on U.S. health care resources. In large chronic
pain cohorts, over 40% meet ACR criteria for FM. Thus, individuals affected with FM and other CSS make up a
substantial proportion of the population receiving opioids. Accurate identification of subjects with FM and other
CSS is urgently needed in order to avoid inappropriate administration of opioids and the danger of chronic opioid
treatment in at risk populations. Our proposal is innovative in both its theoretical underpinnings and
methodological approach of examining spectroscopic analyses as a diagnostic adjunct in well characterized FM
patients while utilizing both subjective and objective monitoring. These proposed studies can lead to evidence
based alternative therapy for this population. The scientific premise is based on the knowledge that non-targeted
fingerprinting approaches have been shown to have a role in identifying FM patients relative to other conditions
including Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), Osteoarthritis (OA), Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and normal controls
(NC). We now seek to determine the extent to which vibrational (infrared and Raman) spectroscopy technology
and supervised pattern recognition analysis (“chemometrics”) can be honed to further differentiate FM subsets
and pair this approach with complementary metabolomics by LC-MS/MS to identify pharmacologic targets of
interest for this condition that suffers from a lack of reliable therapeutic options. During the R61 Phase we will
(Aim 1): Determine the clinical reliability of bloodspot-based biomarkers to differentiate subjects with FM from
individuals with OA, CLBP (Chronic Low Back Pain), RA, SLE and NCs by vibrational spectroscopy techniques.
We will use multiple validated assessment instruments to grade disease severity. (R61 Aim 2): Determine the
robustness of bloodspot-based biomarker. (R61 Aim 2b): Investigate the effect of intra- and inter-assay
variability, and storage conditions on biomarker reliability using known independent (not used in developing the
calibration model) data sets of subjects from all groups. (R61 Aim 3): Evaluate the metabolic profile of the
biological samples from our subjects. Chemometric analysis of the unique spectral patterns permits
determination of bands most responsible for differentiating test subjects. During the R33 Phase: (Aim 4):
Distinguish FM activity (flares) relative to quiescent phases of FM. Determine changes in disease activity in
patients between baseline and subsequent follow up visits of each patient. The culmination of these aims will
clarify the diagnosis of FM, the most frequent neuropathic disorder encountered in clinical medicine, will help
alleviate unnecessary medical testing and will serve as a deterrent to opioid prescribing in this at risk population."
10914646,"In cystic fibrosis (CF), mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) unleash a
cascade of clinical disorders, including chronic airway infections, systemic inflammation, microbial virulence,
diabetes, malnutrition and liver disease. Great progress has been made in some areas of disease, and CFTR
modulators provide dramatic benefits to some patients. Still, there is growing evidence of the interconnections
among lung and gut dysbiosis and CF pathogenesis. As patients live longer, formerly rare symptoms are
becoming more common. Thus, there is a pressing need to both understand and systematically treat the
functional relationships between CFTR function, commensal and pathogenic microbes, metabolic states, and
innate and acquired immune responses. Dartmouth has an interactive CF research team of 49 faculty members
with extramural funding of $11.1M/year, studying epithelial biology, CFTR correction, host-microbe interactions,
gut dysbiosis and immunity, as well as airway infections and antimicrobial strategies. The Dartmouth CF
Research Center (DartCF) will build on progress made in the past year. We will deploy P30 and institutional
funds to recruit new CF faculty, strengthen our research base, and foster interdisciplinary discovery. Our aims
are: 1) to catalyze new research in CF basic and translational research in areas of interest to NIDDK; 2) to
develop integrative strategies to understand and address CF pathobiology; 3) to create new research tools and
support CF research through outstanding shared services; and 4) to build research capacity in CF locally,
regionally, and nationally. We will focus P30 resources on 1) pioneering transparency and interoperability for CF
datasets, 2) forging collaborations between CF and data-science researchers to mine these datasets for
systems-level perspectives and 3) building on unique Dartmouth longitudinal patient cohorts to explore microbial
community structure in the gut, host-microbe signaling, the effects of existing therapies, and implications for
whole-body disease. A key theme is that dysbioses are interconnected, and that parallel investigations, coupled
by powerful new data-science strategies can understand this complex underlying biology and reveal new
therapeutic approaches. In parallel, we will leverage our research base to support early-stage preclinical target
development. DartCF supports a variety of mechanisms. First, we fund a Pilot Project Project (P3) to develop
new scientific opportunities in NIDDK-revelant areas and to recruit new faculty members to the Center. Second,
we fund three scientific cores to support studies in CF: a Gastrointestinal Biology Core (GIBC), a Clinical and
Translational Research Core (CTRC), and a CF Bioinformatics & Biostatistics Core (CF-BBC). Finally, we
support an Enrichment and Research Administration Core (ERAC) to foster an interactive scientific community,
sponsor retreats and courses, and track program progress. These efforts will identify new CF therapeutic
opportunities, develop novel interventions, monitor the resulting changes body-wide, and track outcomes.
DartCF will intensify the translation of research into improved CF outcomes at Dartmouth."
10835939,"PROJECT SUMMARY
THIRD COAST CFAR: OVERALL
The broad, long-term mission of the Third Coast Center for AIDS Research (TC CFAR) is to use our
trans-disciplinary collaborations to power transformational advances across the translational spectrum
from discovery to implementation of effective interventions - and end HIV. Many local resources at
Northwestern University (UC), the University of Chicago (UC), and community partners have been, and
will continue to be, brought to bear on this mission. The allowable Funded Research Base (FRB)
increased by 47%, and projects became more trans-disciplinary, from FY14 to FY18. Nimble and
opportunistic strategic planning (by the Administrative Core, AC) and robust growth in seed funding
and mentoring programs (by the Developmental Core, DC) led to those successes, and to choosing
specific, high-priority HIV research topics as foci for a second term. Institutional support has increased.
The Overall scientific aims were also chosen based on each of the 3 scientific Cores having a user
base and expert resources with strengths on each aim. Each of these Cores has also worked to extend
their resources and expertise to researchers outside their own domains, and thereby helped build
collaborations. The following Overall aims build on our solid foundation, and will direct each scientific
Core, in concert with the AC and the DC, to synergistically advance the science needed to end HIV.
Overall Aim 1: To continue and expand collaborative research that will slow, and eventually stop, the
HIV epidemic by improving continuums of HIV prevention and care.
Overall Aim 2: To advance understanding of accelerated aging-related illnesses (non-AIDS
comorbidities) that occur despite suppression of HIV viremia.
Overall Aim 3: To speed discovery and empower development of transformative scientific innovations
that will improve HIV prevention and treatment for persons living with HIV."
11194675,"An Other Transaction Agreement award would establish City of Hope and its principle
investigator, Dr. Joseph Gold, in a leadership role to work with NHLBI to establish this resource over the
next 3 years.
• An initial activity for City of Hope would be the conduct of a needs assessment to ensure an
understanding of the sickle cell community needs as it relates to cell and vector product
manufacturing, along with associated reagents, for curative genetic therapies. This assessment
would include an evaluation of the landscape of manufacturers and their current capacity to
manufacture the identified products at the current study stages ongoing within the community.
Such assessments would be conducted with the assistance of the current Cure SCI infrastructure;
prospective PIs would be surveyed to understand their projected needs. A team of City of Hope
experts with backgrounds in the treatment of SCD, CD34+cell modification, and GMP manufacturing
(Joseph Rosenthal, MD; John Zaia, MD; Angelo Cardoso, MD, PhD; Joseph Gold, PhD; see attached
biosketches) will assess the needs and determine how best to identify facilities with the expertise to
help.
• Following the assessment, in the first year City of Hope would create a strategy and plan for a
consortium approach to the manufacturing resource platform for the CureSC initiative that covers
vector and cell production for SCD, even if City of Hope is not a primary manufacturing site. We will
also address the need for assay development to measure therapeutic efficacy and off‐target editing.
This plan will address short‐term and long‐term goals and can evolve given the desire to build
capacity over time.
• NHLBI, working with through the leadership at City of Hope, would establish a consortium or
network of manufacturers during the first year. This approach would address current demands by
tapping into any excess capacity that may exist among this handful of places while manufacturers
begin to build the capacity that will handle multiple investigators at once and reach the scale that
will be needed to move CureSC science through to clinical trials. Yearly funding would be available
to each consortium member to cover administrative and travel costs. We suggest that the
consortium be comprised of 5 members (including CBG), selected from a number of sites that will
have expressed interest in the consortium as a result of the survey performed by the outside entity.
Members would then be selected based on their experience and capacity to take on SCD projects;
this selection process would include site visits by Dr. Gold and, if needed, additional COH personnel.
o NHLBI and COH will work together to ensure that the consortium is integrated into the
overall infrastructure of the Cure Sickle Cell Initiative structure. It is expected that
consortium members will work collaboratively with other Initiative members as well as
outside entities, including academic, biotech, and other Federal partners (e.g. the US Food
and Drug Administration).
o Members of the consortium will be required to produce semiannual reports summarizing
their activities that are relevant to the Cure SCI program.
o In addition to regular conference calls among the consortium members, COH and NHLBI
staff, we will establish a yearly in person meeting among the participants to review overall
progress and to identify challenges and opportunities for the SCD community.
o The NHLBI would allocate funds for projects estimated at $500,000 (the cost of a typical
lentivirus production at CBG) at each of the 5 consortium members during year 2. In order
to keep the consortium intact, year 3 funds would be allocated for consortium member
administrative costs, with the expectation that NHLBI would allocate additional funding for
new manufacturing projects, depending on the demand. Once established, the consortium
can be kept intact and functional for additional years based on NHLBI’s funding.
• It is anticipated that to provide the leadership and management necessary for this project, that the
Other Transaction Agreement award would support City of Hope to bring on a project manager who
would work closely with Dr. Gold to execute this project.
• As part of an Other Transaction Agreement award, obligated funds will only be available for draw
down by milestones that are collaboratively established with City of Hope and align to a larger work
plan. These milestones can change over time through mutual agreement between NHLBI and City of
Hope."
11015370,"Harnessing Proteins as Drugs—the Protectome of Cancer- and Aging-Prevention Proteins
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a disease of toxic misfolded proteins, which both induce and are induced by poor proteostasis. Improving proteostasis appears to prevent AD in that the only cancers negatively correlated with Alzheimer’s are those that require and overproduce HSP90 protein chaperone. Because proteins maintain DNA, poor proteostasis also provokes DNA damage and mutations that in turn corrupt proteostasis. So increased DNA damage can be both a biomarker and driver of poor proteostasis and Alzheimer’s pathogenesis. This project has three central hypotheses centered on prevention of age-related diseases including Alzheimer’s: first, that cells can be made “better-than-normal” by upregulation of native proteins that shield cellular components from damaging agents, so that they tolerate or prevent genome instability and proteotoxicity. Upregulating these proteins could produce the most benign possible “drugs”—our own proteins—for prevention and treatment of diseases driven by genome instability and proteostasis decay, whether or not the genetic or environmental disease causes are known. However, these “molecular-shield” proteins have remained unknown because no technology was sensitive enough to find them by revealing cells with less DNA damage than in “normal” cells. Moreover, no technology has harnessed native proteins as “drugs,” by upregulation. Second, I hypothesize that natural proteins can be made into “proteoceutical” drugs by upregulating them pharmacologically—that exogenous agents could increase production of specific proteins to protect cells. Finally, I propose a sensitive blood-pressure-like general diagnostic for pre-disease and early detection of AD, cancer, and other age-associated diseases, using DNA-damage markers. This would identify individuals who need the proposed molecular-shield proteoceutical therapies.
The molecular-shield proteins are likely to include, among others, (1) ubiquitous disordered stress-resistance proteins that form functional shields on interaction with diverse macromolecules, allowing them to function in otherwise toxic environments; (2) detoxifying proteins that rid cells of protein-, lipid- and DNA-damaging agents; (3) repressors of pathways that produce toxic byproducts; and (4) protein quality-control proteins. 
The goals of this project are to—(1) identify native molecular-shield proteins in the simple model organism E. coli and in human; and pioneer new technological paradigms for (2) a blood-based general diagnostic, using DNA-damage markers, for early and pre-disease detection of Alzheimer’s, neurodegeneration, cancer and other age-related diseases; and (3) creation of “proteoceutical drugs” from native human molecular-shield proteins, for use against AD and many medical problems. The results may form the basis of understanding a fundamentally new class of natural disease/AD-resistance proteins, detect individuals who may benefit from boosting them, and harness these and other proteins as health-promoting drugs."

the NIH and consortium partners. Specifically, our goals are to further develop and enrich the All of Us experience for new and existing
participants and to build out an intuitive, efficient experience for diverse sets of researchers from across the nation.
In year one, we will advance design research and experience design initiatives that focus on holistic experience strategies for [I]
participants and [II] researchers. This research will move program priorities forward and ensure that we deliver the right experience
to the right people at the right time.
I. Participants
As an extension of your team, we have successfully reached communities underrepresented in biomedical research (UBR) at an
unprecedented rate. Approximately 80% of the program’s over 200,000 registered individuals (over 121,000 core participants) are
UBR. According to Francis Collins, All of Us is “now considered the largest and most diverse cohort of its kind” (“The Future of Health
Begins with All of Us” webcast, March 14, 2019). While expanding to new audiences, we want to build and sustain these relationships.
This is why our top priority for year one is to improve the participant experience—to keep members motivated and engaged beyond
consent, for the long haul.
To do this, a core objective will be designing pathways that center on participant choice. Our marketing and communications initiatives
will ensure that participants, regardless of whether they enter through DV or HPO pathways, have a smooth and engaging experience
through joining, consenting, and staying involved. We will apply this same principle to create a parent/child-centered journey and
related strategies following insights development.
II. Researchers
With the launch of the Researcher Portal in fall 2019, we will begin to engage a broader research community by leveraging ambassador
researchers who are part of our awardee network. This community of first adopters will support pilot projects and reinforce a sense
of validity, quality, and trust for the growing All of Us dataset as a critically important and unprecedented resource for biomedical
research. In addition, we will continue to support the design of the researcher hub, workbench, and other digital tools and help define
the overarching product roadmap and end-to-end experience for researchers. Using design research methods, we will build parallel
experiences that work for researchers in different contexts, especially those outside of academic institutions (i.e. citizen scientists,
community colleges, etc.).
Below is a high-level summary of our primary objectives in year one. In years two to five, we will continue to develop audience and
program insights, ideate, and refine processes and approaches with our partners at the national and local levels to increase enrollment
and retention as well as encourage researchers to engage with the incredible dataset the program is building. In the sections below,
we provide greater detail on the strategies, workstreams, and teams necessary to achieve these objectives."
10700547,"Abstract
White matter (WM) damage has increasingly been recognized as an important contributing factor to
neurodegeneration and dementia, however, little is known of the specific molecular and cellular events
underlying the pathogenesis. Clinically, chronic hypoperfusion is often associated with WM changes in small
vessel disease. We previously demonstrated that mice deficient in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)
spontaneously develop chronic cerebral hypoperfusion in multiple areas that precisely match to the most
vulnerable areas of hypoperfusion in early demented patients, surrounded by elevated ROS and
neuroinflammation, microbleeds, cerebral amyloid angiopathy in middle aged mice, followed by hippocampal
neurodegeneration in older age. Moreover, these mice develop WM changes (e.g., myelin and oligodendrocyte
loss) at middle age, accompanied by marked astrogliosis and selective loss of pyramidal neurons in cortical
layers 2/3 and 5/6. We found upregulated bone morphogenic protein BMP4 in pericytes in these mice at younger
age, preceding myelin loss, and pericytes are the most vulnerable cell type to hypoperfusion among the others
in neurovascular unit. We therefore hypothesize that pericyte degeneration is the earliest pathological event in
WM in eNOS-deficient model, preceding blood-brain-barrier breakdown, astrogliosis, myelin loss and neocortical
neurodegeneration; pericyte-BMP4 is a critical initiating factor to these events. Three Aims are proposed. Aim
1. We will use optical histological approach to image pericytes in whole brain after clearing to determine when
and where pericyte losses occur in eNOS model, and the cell-cell communication in neuro-glial vascular units.
Aim 2. We will profile expressional changes of BMP4 in different cell types using BMP4-CFP reporter mice as
well as validate BMP4 protein upregulation in WM pericytes in human brain cortical samples of a large cohort of
vascular dementia cases. We will also block overactivated BMP4 signaling at early age by Noggin infusion to
CNS and fully characterize gene alteration on microvessels by RNAseq analysis. Positive outcome will identify
novel molecular mechanism and molecules as potential therapeutic targets for WM disease. Aim 3.
Neurophysiological determination of white and gray matter functions in eNOS deficient mice. We will conduct in
vitro electrophysiology (brain slice recording) to detect WM axonal functional abnormalities in corpus callosum
and patch clamping for cortical neuronal abnormalities in intrinsic membrane excitability, action potential
properties and excitatory synaptic circuits in cortical layer 2/3 and 5/6, as well as in vivo electrophysiology-tetrode
spike recording in freely moving mice. Successful completion of these tasks will provide direct evidence for a
causative role and mechanisms of WM and vascular changes in WM and cortical dysfunction and functional loss
in neurodegenerative diseases, a highly under-explored area."
10903998,"Overall: Project Summary
The vision science group at Augusta University/Medical College of Georgia is known collectively as the James
and Jean Culver Vision Discovery Institute (Culver VDI). The mission of the Culver VDI is to engage in high
impact research and discovery for patients suffering from blindness and visual disorders. Within this group of
basic science researchers and ophthalmologists are 22 investigators who direct 15 NEI R01s, 2 NEI R21s and
1 NEI K99. The objective of the center core grant for vision research is (1) to provide crucially needed
expertise and instrumentation to enhance the research programs of these talented investigators and (2) to
promote collaborations within the group and with scientists across the nation. To achieve this mission, we have
organized facilities, services and shared instrumentation into the following three modules: (1) Visual Function
Assessment; (2) Histology and Imaging; (3) Gene Expression/Proteomics. These modules provide research
resources, services and shared instrumentation that are essential to the success of ongoing projects in multiple
laboratories. Support of these modules will boost development of new projects and enhance collaborations
bringing the best of the latest technology to our NEI-funded research. Augusta University is committed to vision
science and to the Culver VDI, which launched in 2008. Since that time, the University has supported
recruitment of 11 vision research faculty with competitive start-up packages and laboratory space across
multiple departments and colleges. The University has sponsored clinically-relevant pilot projects and travel
awards for trainees, assisted with the purchase of sophisticated instrumentation and facilitated
collaboration/communication through the support of a robust seminar series, an annual retreat and monthly
group meetings. Support is requested in the form of this Center Core Grant for Vision Research to achieve the
following aims: Aim 1. To provide support for module personnel who assist and train investigators and their
staff in the use of sophisticated instrumentation and methodology. Aim 2. To provide select services thereby
enhancing productivity of Augusta University vision researchers and avoiding unnecessary duplication of
equipment/effort. Aim 3. To ensure continued productivity of outstanding clinically-relevant vision research by
assisting: a) established and first-time NEI R01-funded investigators, b) established NEI R01-funded
investigators who seek to renew their NEI-funded projects or develop new vision-related projects, c) scientists
from other fields who bring their scientific expertise to the fields of vision research."
10879114,"Project Summary
The OVERALL aims of this Vision Research Core (VRC) are to provide:
• access to resources outside the scope of individual PIs and their R01 awards
• access to technical expertise outside the scope a single laboratory
• staff training to remove barriers to efficient translational research and collaboration
• collaboration initiatives among VRC labs
The research areas supported by the VRC span the analysis and treatments of retinal degenerations,
developmental disorders, glaucoma and other disorders, as well as a range of cutting-edge basic science
initiatives. We have implemented four resource modules that continue the natural evolution of how this
research group works together, serving 17 investigators holding 22 NEI R01 awards.
The Imaging Module provides a range of imaging (TEM, confocal, scanning optical) and computing services
(imaging, database, mathematics) based on strengths of core laboratories and the tradition of excellence of the
UU School of Computing, whose descendants founded Adobe Systems, Silicon Graphics, Netscape and Pixar.
Collaborations among these groups have transformed software tools for TEM and confocal imaging.
The Cell Biology Module derives from the strengths in mouse genetics at the Moran Eye Center and the high
demand for tissue profiling. Almost every JMEC laboratory has need of high quality cryosectioning,
paratoming, mouse genotyping, immunostaining training, immunocytochemistry, quantitative PCR, in-situ
hybridization technologies.
.
The Physiology Module is a powerful set of tools that VRC faculty use for animal model validation and
disease profiling: ERG set-ups (LKC Big Shot and an older LKC setup), multi-focal ERG (Phoenix), in vivo / in

10819489,"Overall Project Summary/Abstract (Center for Gene Therapy of Cystic Fibrosis)
For the past 21 years, this P30 Center for Gene Therapy of Cystic Fibrosis has focused on developing effective
treatments for cystic fibrosis (CF) through an increased understanding of disease pathogenesis, the
identification of relevant cellular targets for gene manipulation, and the development of technologies capable of
effectively delivering or editing the CFTR gene in vivo. The creation of multiple types of CF pig and ferret
models had led to an expansion of CF research over the past 5-year funding period. While during previous
funding cycles CF lung research has been one focus area and within the scope of these P30 CF Centers, we
have also greatly expanded research in other areas directly within the NIDDK mission. These areas of
research will be further expanded in this application through the Center's Research Cores and the focus of
faculty research areas. These areas include research on CF pancreatic disease and its similarities and
differences to other forms of juvenile pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) research, CF
gallbladder disease, and CF intestinal disease. Many of these areas were already strengths during the
previous funding period. Furthermore, the creation of the tools required to interrogate CF disease processes in
organs like the pancreas have been enabled by new genetic engineering approaches in ferrets through the
Center's Animal Models Core. The Center has productively fostered CF research through the following
mechanisms. 1) The Center's Pilot and Feasibility Program, which has sponsored 66 pilots over the previous
21 years of funding, has brought numerous new Members and expertise into the Center, and has fostered the
maturation of talented junior Associate Members to independent tenure-track faculty. 2) The establishment or
expansion of several core facilities (Vector Core, Cell and Tissue Core, Comparative Pathology Core, Animal
Models Core, and Clinical Core) devoted to CF research has provided Center investigators with specialized
vectors, CF model systems (human, pig, ferret and mouse), and approaches that are testing important
hypotheses about CF pathogenesis and developing effective therapies. These resources have also enabled
the Center to serve as a resource for the distribution of viral vectors and CF pig and ferret resources to
numerous outside institutions. 3) Expansion of the number of CF ferret and pig models that develop lung,
pancreatic, gallbladder and intestinal abnormalities like those observed in CF patients has greatly facilitated
research by Center Members. 4) The Center's Enrichment Programs have fostered interdisciplinary
interactions and training. 5) Establishment of formal internal and external mechanisms for review of the Center,
the Cores, and the Pilot and Feasibility projects has ensured a high level of excellence and the most
appropriate utilization of the Center's resources. In summary, the Center has greatly strengthened existing CF
research programs at the University of Iowa, while also serving as a resource for other institutions engaged in
CF research."

10917152,"The UNC CFRTCC has set as its long-term goal the systemic “cure” of the cystic fibrosis (CF) phenotype,
including in the GI tract, pancreas, and lung. There is a broad need on the UNC-CH campus for a Core Research
Center to synergize and accelerate the pace of therapeutics development for CF. Our CF research base is broad
and encompasses groups with expertise in CFTR biogenesis/ion transport, genetics, gene therapy, GI and
airway epithelial cell biology, mucus/mucin biochemistry and biophysics, microbiology/immunology, and clinical
research. This group of investigators with CF therapeutic interests includes presently > 100 faculty. To accelerate
therapeutics development on the UNC-CH campus, there are needs for accurate and efficient in vitro and in vivo
testing of therapeutic agents, access to diverse and sufficient supplies of epithelial cells (GI, airway), access to
new mucus/mucin technologies relevant to CF pathogenesis, and a clinical research network that provides
patient specimens, clinical testing, and advisory services necessary for the therapeutics development process.
In response to these needs, we have proposed a CF RTCC with four service cores that are designed to provide
access to their reagents/technologies for UNC, national, and international investigators. The CF RTCC will
service a broad spectrum of therapies, including new chemical entities (NCEs), gene transfer vectors, and gene
modification approaches. The four service cores include: (1) the Molecular/Functional Measurement Core
(Martina Gentzsch, PI),which will offer state of the art in vitro measures of CFTR function in GI and airway
systems, complemented by novel mutant CFTR, mutant mucin, and βENaC mice, complemented by new CF
rabbit models, for in vivo studies of CF molecular pathogenesis/therapeutics and GI/airway epithelial disease;
(2) the Cell Models Core (Scott Randell, PI),which builds on its world-class experience in providing high-quality
primary, P1, P2, conditionally reprogrammed cells (CRC), and immortalized cells, and robust GI stem cell
techniques for provision of organoid and novel 2D cultures; (3) the Mucus Biochemistry and Biophysics Core
(Brian Button, PI), which will provide access to unparalleled new measures of the key biochemical and
biophysical mucus abnormalities that relate to CF pathogenesis and therapeutics and novel biomarker
development; and (4) The Clinical Translation Core (Scott Donaldson, PI), which will provide the requisite GI
biopsies for epithelial pathogenesis and genotype-specific therapeutic studies, generate sputum repositories,
bring a spectrum of novel imaging technologies (including F19 based MRI ventilation/washout kinetics measures)
into the CF field, and provide advice to the UNC CF and outside communities to with respect to therapeutics
development. These Cores will be supported by an Administrative Core (R. Boucher, PI), which will oversee
budgetary, communication, and program enhancement functions. The UNC CF RTCC is designed to provide a
wide spectrum of services that are critical for CF studies of epithelial pathogenesis and therapeutics development

The principal mission of the Duke Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) is to establish and grow comprehensive
infrastructure support for a research environment that will effectively promote collaboration, coordination, and
innovation throughout the Duke HIV/AIDS research community and across the national CFAR network. As
evidenced by the growth in our NIH-Funded Research Base that now qualifies us as a Tier 2 CFAR, this
competitive renewal application represents an evolution that builds upon our accomplishments and lessons
learned during the previous funding cycles, taking advantage of the synergies established among our Core
components. A solid basis is formed by our highly successful Pilot Grant mechanism, aimed primarily at Early
Stage Investigators, and our equally successful faculty recruitment efforts, both of which have facilitated
greater gender and racial diversity. The driving force behind all of our evolving support services is a highly
active and effective Strategic Planning process, led by our Executive Committee (EC), with valuable input from
both our advisory committees and our intramural Strategic Partners. This highly iterative process has identified
five Specific Aims to guide the CFAR's growth and evolution over the next 5 years: 1) Provide comprehensive
infrastructure support to all intramural HIV/AIDS investigators aimed at expanding the robust program of inter-
disciplinary, collaborative HIV research that addresses NIH Research priorities. 2) Continue development of a
pipeline of next generation HIV/AIDS investigators through strong support of Early Stage Investigators and
engagement of established investigators from outside the field of HIV/AIDS research. 3) Foster critical
synergies through Core-Core interactions and engagement of new and existing Strategic Partnerships. 4)
Expand the relevance, reach, and impact of HIV/AIDS research by implementing and supporting community
engagement and outreach. 5) Further enhance and support collaborative activities throughout the global
network of CFARs. Support services will be enhanced by increased institutional support from Duke's School of
Medicine and Department of Surgery. Through our Strategic Planning process, we have identified eight priority
areas that represent opportunities for further development during the next funding cycle. These include: 1) the
`Southern HIV Epidemic'; 2) HIV Co-Morbidities, Co-Infections, and Complications; 3) Latency and Eradication;
4) Health Disparities; 5) Vaccine Design and Evaluation; 6) Mental Health and Substance Abuse; 7) the HIV
Organ Policy Equity (HOPE) Act; and 8) Emerging Infections. Finally, to ensure the continued high-quality
support for intramural HIV/AIDS investigators, the EC has formulated a Leadership Transition Plan, vetted by
the institution, in which Dr. Georgia Tomaras and Dr. Susanna Naggie will become Director and Co-Director,
respectively. The CFAR looks forward to developing and exploring these timely opportunities within Duke and
across the CFAR network throughout the next funding cycle."
10877939,"OVERALL SUMMARY
 T lymphocytes utilized  T cell receptors (TCRs) to distinguish self versus non-self through recognition
of sparse antigenic peptides bound to MHC molecules (pMHC) arrayed on antigen presenting cells (APC).
Through remarkable specificity and digital sensitivity,  T lymphocytes can destroy host cells altered by viruses,
other infectious pathogens or cancerous transformations while leaving normal cellular counterparts intact. Until
recently, it was unclear how TCR discrimination was achieved, given a lack of somatic mutations of TCR
genes to boost receptor-ligand affinity unlike with B cell receptors. Contrary to conventional ligand associations
exemplified by antigen-antibody interactions, however, it is now evident that physical force plays a crucial role in
non-equilibrium TCR-based T cell activation. Here we investigate the overarching hypothesis that  lineage
receptors that recognize pMHC ligands, namely TCRs and preTCRs, function as mechanosensors, transducing
biomechanical forces to impact thymocyte development as well as T cell antigen recognition and activation. Both
TCRs and preTCRs utilize force to induce different receptor conformers associated with energized and non-
energized states. Project 1 shall elucidate biophysical features driving TCR mechanosensing using paired
single molecule and single cell measurements via optical tweezers (OT) to determine non-equilibrium dynamics
and parameterization of energy landscapes under force. In turn, CD8 T cell responses such as antigen-specific
in vitro triggering sensitivity and in vivo cellular proliferation, effector and memory T cell development will be
assessed using TCR retrogenic mice. RNAseq analysis of various populations and single cells shall define the
connection between force-dependent transcriptomes and physical load on TCR-pMHC bonds. Project 2 shall
perform comparable OT biophysical studies on preTCRs and pMHC interactions using high throughput next
generation sequencing (NGS) of DN3, DN4, DP large and DP small subsets to determine TCR repertoire
changes in MHC-sufficient and MHC-deficient animals in vitro and in vivo. By determining  chain clonotypes
that are selected or disallowed during thymocyte developmental progression upon interaction with specific single-
chain pMHC ligands, coupled RNAseq analysis of thymocytes expressing those preTCRs, OT profiling,
Molecular Dynamics (MD) and NMR and X-ray crystallography structural studies, the rules governing early
thymic selection by pMHC shall be defined. Distinctions among  and TCR lineages with respect to
mechanical force shall be similarly analyzed and compared. Project 3 shall develop cutting-edge NMR methods
to reveal allosteric mechanisms of preTCR and TCR receptors upon pMHC ligation, characterizing major and
minor state structures and kinetics of interconversion aided by the MD Core to enhance atomistic detailing. An
Administrative Core (A), a Protein Production Core (B) and a MD Core (C) will assist all Projects to discern how
force empowers  T lineage recognition of pMHC with basic and translational importance."
10875750,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) is genetically complex and thought to be associated with variants in a
number of different loci, including structural variants (SVs), which could in part explain the additional missing
heritability and genetic background. However, the impact of SVs on LOAD has not been systematically explored,
while findings regarding CNV associations with AD risk have been overall inconsistent. To address this gap in
knowledge, we propose to fully characterize the genetic architecture of SVs in LOAD by leveraging previously
generated large-scale whole genome sequencing data. To this end, we will systematically characterize SVs
across 39,000 samples from multi-ethnic, well-phenotyped individuals sequenced as a part of Alzheimer’s
Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) discovery, extension replication (ADSP-DEP) and follow-up datasets
(ADSP-FUS), as well as in over 1000 multiplex families. Identification of novel SVs associated with LOAD could
implicate previously unknown genes and elucidate biological mechanisms that could be leveraged to generate
novel therapeutics and diagnostic markers."
10875774,"Abstract. A plethora of neuroscience and neuroimaging studies have shown that Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
differentially affects certain regions of the brain and specific cell types. Since AD-related pathological events
often propagate trans-neuronally, the selective vulnerability to neuron loss and structure damage also manifest
in the topological patterns of network alteration. Along with many other studies, the research team has found the
strong evidence that (1) AD preferentially affects hub nodes in the network that are densely connected in the
network, and (2) the propagation of neuropathological burdens such as amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary
tangles exhibit unique topological patterns that are governed by the self-organized harmonic bases. However,
the factors underlying this network vulnerability and the molecular mechanism regulating the selectivity in AD
remain unclear. In this regard, we aim to continue the development of cutting-edge network analysis tools with
a greater methodological understanding of how neuropathological events selectively affect certain harmonic
bases (harmonic-selective network vulnerability) and how brain networks counteract AD pathology (network
resilience). In this context, the backbone of this project is a harmonic factor analysis model that can be used as
a neurobiological basis to accurately characterize the whole-brain mapping of neurodegeneration at a system
level, where each harmonic factor explains how the ubiquitous propagation (wave) pattern of neuropathological
event emerges from the particular structural connectome pathway. In Aim 1, we will leverage the well-studied
biophysics concept of power and energy to identify a set of harmonic-selective vulnerable patterns that account
for network vulnerability between normal aging and AD. Also, we will associatethe identified network vulnerability
with couple factors from diverse research fields which include stochastics of selectivity (statistics), system
criticality (physics), network organization (network neuroscience), and cognitive domains (clinic). After that, we
will seek for the putative harmonic-genetics biomarker based on the discovered association between network
vulnerability and genetics factor in Aim 2 and develop a harmonic-genetic approach to capture network resilience
in Aim 3. In Aim 4, we will apply the computational approaches developed in Aim 1-3 to establish (1) a fine-
grain understanding of network vulnerability and resilience across A (amyloid-PET), T (Tau-PET), and N (FDG-
PET and cortical thickness) biomarkers, and (2) a longitudinal underpinning of the dynamics of network
vulnerability by investigating the longitudinal change of AT[N] biomarkers. The diagnostic power of our novel
harmonic-genetics biomarker and resilience will be evaluated in our current AD diagnostic engines. We will
release the software (both binary program and source code), to facilitate the other AD biomarker projects and
the neuroimaging studies of other neurocognitive disorders associated with brain network dysfunction."
10875700,"Abstract. A devastating class of untreatable, neurodegenerative disorders, which includes progressive
supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), are associated with
accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain. These aggregates are primarily composed of
microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT/tau), which is heavily modified by post-translational modifications
(PTMs). If we understood how neurons normally regulate tau’s PTMs, we might be able to find ways of restoring
its delicate balance. The objective of this project is to understand how the molecular chaperones, heat shock
protein 70 (Hsp70) and heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), direct modifications on tau. Hsp70 and Hsp90 are known
to bind key, aggregation-prone locations in tau. While these interactions improve the solubility of tau, they also
recruit a number of critical PTM enzymes including: (i) the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP, (ii) the cis-trans prolyl
isomerase FKBP51 and (iii) the protein phosphatase PP5. Specifically, each of these enzymes contains a
tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, which has affinity for the conserved EEVD-CO2H motif at the C-termini
of Hsp70 and Hsp90. Thus, we hypothesize that complexes between chaperones and TPR domains ultimately
determines tau’s conformation and whether it is ubiquitinated or de-phosphorylated. Thanks to innovations in
cryo-EM and recent breakthroughs in large-scale peptide libraries and antibody design, we are poised to use
structural and chemical approaches to understand how chaperones coordinate with TPR proteins to modify tau.
In preliminary studies, we have measured binding of the chaperone’s EEVD motifs to a panel of TPR domains,
revealing unexpected selectivity of Hsp70 for PP5 and Hsp90 for FKBP51, as well as a key role for
phosphorylation in tuning these affinities. We have also created a library of ~640,000 peptide sequences and
used it to identify a potent (<10 nM) inhibitor of CHIP’s TPR domain that does not bind closely related TPRs.
Finally, we have validated a structural approach to studying the Hsp70-CHIP-tau ternary complex, a project
which has already uncovered a surprising, essential role for ADP. Guided by these exciting findings and fueled
by a team-based approach, we propose to study how tau interacts with: (SA1) Hsp70/Hsp90-CHIP, (SA2)
Hsp90-FKBP51 and (SA3) Hsp70-PP5. Through this effort, we aim to determine how molecular switches at the
key protein interfaces tune the structure and modifications on tau. We anticipate that these studies could also
revealing new drug targets for treating tauopathies."
10875735,"Project Summary
This proposal addresses the epigenetic mechanisms of systemic microglia activation during ageing and its
contribution to neurodegenerative diseases. Ageing in mice and human is associated with the increased
expression of pro-inflammatory genes in microglia and microglia pro-inflammatory activation is considered one
of the causes of age-associated neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer disease. The age-associated
increase in microglia-driven inflammation is linked to an aberrantly heightened response of microglia to
different inflammatory stimuli. The enhanced state of microglia activation during ageing resembles the state of
trained immunity where initial immune cell exposure to various pro-inflammatory causes quantitate and
qualitative long-lasting changes in cell responses to environmental triggers. We hypothesize that increased
pro-inflammatory activity of microglia reflects the history of microglia exposure to inflammatory signals during
animal or human life. We argue that infectious diseases, many of which can occur early in life, and the
accompanied systemic inflammation exposes microglia to periphery-derived pro-inflammatory signals.
Exposure to pro-inflammatory triggers can leave an epigenetic imprint that drives heightened inflammatory
gene expression in ageing microglia. To test this hypothesis, we will induce transient systemic inflammation in
mice followed by the analysis of gene expression at differed ages. The long-lasting changes in gene
expression that follow innate immune cell activation has been previously linked to the activation of latent
enhancers. We propose to determine the activation state of microglia enhancers after initial activation followed
by the lifelong monitoring of the enhancer activity. We demonstrated that treatment of microglia with
pharmacological inhibitors of BET proteins, that play a prominent role in enhancer activity, leads to the potent
suppression of microglia activation in vitro and in vivo. Most notably, treatment with BET inhibitors has a major
therapeutic impact on mice that suffer from AD. We will address the specific contribution of individual BET
proteins to pro-inflammatory gene expression and enhancer activation during ageing and in
neurodegeneration. This information is highly relevant for our understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms that
govern the systemic age-associated microglial inflammatory state and may lead to the development of novel
approaches for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases."
10611783,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Optimal brain health requires effective cerebrovascular function, adequate perfusion, and highly responsive
blood flow regulation. If any of these, or a combination of these, are compromised, there are implications for
brain health. Previous research demonstrated that cerebral hypoperfusion and inadequate cerebrovascular
responses to vasoactive stimuli may precede the onset of cognitive impairment. Indeed, adults with cognitive
impairment, including vascular dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, exhibit inadequate cerebral perfusion. Yet,
the majority of evidence linking hypoperfusion to cognition comes from preclinical models, and there is minimal
research on how chronic cerebral hypoperfusion may impact cerebrovascular control in humans. Accordingly,
there is a critical need for more research on the pathophysiology of cognitive decline in humans. Our preliminary
data indicate that adults with cerebral anatomical variations demonstrate cerebral hypoperfusion and reduced
cerebrovascular reactivity. This finding is important as it presents our investigative team with a group of
individuals with a cerebral anatomical variant that may naturally model a state of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion.
Our overarching hypothesis is that chronic hypoperfusion, resulting from a specific variation in cerebrovascular
architecture, impacts cerebral blood flow regulation which increases the risk of cognitive impairment. Thus, the
objectives of this application are to investigate chronic models of hypoperfusion in humans, examine
compensatory mechanisms to maintain perfusion, and determine the potential impact on cognitive health. For
each aim, we will recruit participants from a unique, risk-enriched cohort of middle-aged and older adults from
the University of Wisconsin-Madison Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center. This cohort has extensive
longitudinal data on medical health, genetics, and cognitive biomarkers. We will use state-of-the-art imaging
modalities to identify differences in cerebrovascular architecture and quantify cerebral blood flow regulation in
the following specific aims: In Specific Aim 1, we will examine the compensatory responses to a model of acute
hypoperfusion and determine the impact of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion observed in adults with specific
cerebral anatomical variations. In Specific Aim 2, we will utilize aerobic exercise to characterize the
cerebrovascular responses to acute hyperperfusion and determine the impact of cerebral anatomical variations.
In Specific Aim 3 we will determine the impact of cerebral anatomical variations on cerebrovascular control and
establish whether adults with cerebral anatomical variations are at a higher risk of cognitive decline. This project
will be the first systematic investigation of cerebrovascular control mechanisms in acute and chronic cerebral
hypoperfusion in humans, and will address the potential implications of long-term hypoperfusion for cognitive
health. Upon completion, we will understand the impact of cerebral anatomical variations on cerebrovascular
health and the risk of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias."

Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences, the Vision Center Core will achieve three main goals. First, it will provide
NEI-funded researchers (and others directly involved in vision science) with access to state-of-the-art
instrumentation and technical support to enhance their individual research efforts. Second, it will enhance the
environment for vision research at Washington University by fostering collaborations and attracting talented
scientists to the field. Third, the Center Core will support the career development of the next generation of
vision scientists. These goals will be achieved by provision of four Resource Cores, supported by an

 of gene targeting constructs, viral vectors, IVF services, and sperm/embryo cryopreservation.
Provision of these support services and resources will greatly enhance the research capabilities of
investigators at Washington University and facilitate collaboration among new and established vision scientists."
10611807,"Late onset neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), affect more than 7 million
Americans, with the associated healthcare costs currently reaching hundreds of billions of dollars per year (and
constantly rising). It is known that the pathology of AD involves many more cell types than the neurons of the
hippocampus and cortex. The cells that comprise the brain vasculature, including the endothelial cells,
pericytes, astrocytes and smooth muscle cells are critically important in maintaining the balance of health and
disease in the brain. In particular, many properties of the endothelial cells, including their roles in establishing
the blood-brain barrier (BBB), delivering nutrients to the brain, and regulating the proliferation of neural stem
cells, are essential to proper brain function. Studies from our lab and others have demonstrated that brain
vasculature can be restored even after it has been damaged, suggesting new strategies for treating
neurodegenerative disorders via improving the integrity of brain vasculature. In experiments detailed in this
application, we propose to both identify and correct processes within the cells of the brain vasculature that are
known to be affected in Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias. Some of our work is based on the
acknowledgement that aging is the major risk factor for dementia and is also characterized by declining
vasculature. As a step toward obtaining a comprehensive understanding of aging-associated changes in the
brain, our lab recently published a large single-cell RNAseq study comparing young and old mouse brains.
Here, we propose to exploit our knowledge of the gene expression changes that define the aging process to
identify cellular and molecular factors critical to brain blood vessel function and the maintenance of the BBB in
a mouse model of AD. First, we will test several different hypotheses concerning the cellular and molecular
bases for the vascular defects in the AD brain. Surprisingly, recent literature suggests that some of these
changes are mediated by soluble factors and may be reversible. To explore this possibility in greater detail, we
will use our knowledge of the CNS network of cell-cell interactions mediated by secreted factors to identify
potentially correctable changes that occur in AD vasculature. Finally, we will use our lab’s expertise in human
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to employ an in vitro model of the BBB. This in vitro platform will serve
as an important complementary approach to the in vivo mechanistic evaluation of putative aging or
rejuvenation factors in human brain vascular cells. At the same time, we propose modifications of the current in
vitro system that should improve its ability to recapitulate properties of the in vivo BBB. Together, our proposed
studies seek to identify and validate new modulators of brain vasculature and to elucidate how the functions of
these modulators play a role in the maintenance or degradation of the BBB in dementia."

AND FUNCTIONAL STUDIES (PI/PD: David K.C. Cooper)
OVERVIEW OF THE PROGRAM
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Our program has produced genetically-engineered pigs that protect the pig organ from injury by
the primate innate immune response. Organs transplanted from these pigs, together with an effective
(and potentially clinically-applicable) immunosuppressive regimen, have markedly extended pig graft
survival in baboons to months or even years. The current proposal aims to confirm that the combination
of a multi-gene pig and an effective immunosuppressive regimen will allow consistent function of life-
supporting pig kidneys (Project 1) and hearts (Project 3) for 6 months or longer, and of life-supporting
livers for 1 month (to act as a bridge to liver allotransplantation [Project 2]). The work in the 3 Projects
will be supported by 4 Cores.
 Core A (Pig Core) will provide specific multi-gene pigs (to Projects 1-3) that have 8 or more genetic
manipulations that will help overcome the remaining barriers to moving towards clinical trials. Core B
(Immunobiology Core) and Core C (Histopathology Core) will provide evidence of the mechanisms for
the problems being investigated and the therapeutic approaches being explored. Core D (Administrative
Core) will provide an organizational structure to facilitate the success of the proposed Projects.
 Our Aims include (i) exploring methods of preventing or suppressing the adaptive immune
response through either novel pig genetics or pharmacologic interventions, (ii) preventing or reducing the
thrombocytopenia that immediately follows pig liver transplantation in baboons, (iii) preventing or
reducing the rapid growth of pig organs documented early after transplantation into baboons, and (iv)
comprehensively monitoring function of the kidney, liver, and heart after transplantation into baboons in
the presence of a controlled immune response (i.e., in the relative absence of an immune response). The
mechanisms whereby the combination of genetic modification and refinements to the
immunosuppressive regimen prolong graft survival will be investigated by immunological assays and
histopathology techniques.
 Success in Projects 1 and 3 would allow immediate consideration of limited clinical trials of kidney
and/or heart xenotransplantation. Success in Project 2 would allow immediate consideration of a limited
clinical trial in which a pig liver is transplanted as a life-sustaining bridge to allotransplantation. The
overall goal of the 3 projects, therefore, is to advance the science during this 5-year period of funding so
that clinical trials of kidneys and hearts can be initiated as destination therapies (or, in the case of the
heart, possibly initially as a bridging therapy), and of pig livers as bridging to allotransplantation."

This P30 Ophthalmology Core Facility provides ongoing support for NEI-funded Oregon Health and Science
University (OHSU) and Casey Eye Institute vision researchers. The four resource cores are: Bioimaging &
Confocal Microscopy; Gene Expression & Manipulation; Genetic Models of Ocular Disease & Biostatistics; and
Proteomics. These shared resources will provide equipment and personnel otherwise not available to individual
researchers working in a wide range of vision-threatening diseases, including cataracts, glaucoma, macular
degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, uveitis, pediatric eye disease, the physiology of vision and the genetics of
glaucoma, macular degeneration, uveitis and inherited retinal diseases. The Bioimaging & Confocal Microscopy
core will support confocal microscopy studies using state-of-the-art instrumentation for identification and high-
resolution localization of proteins. In addition, this core will continue to support small animal imaging through
maintenance of a Micron IV Retinal Imaging Microscope for in vivo imaging of rodent eyes. The Gene Expression
& Manipulation core will provide instrumentation and technical support for a range of molecular methods to
identify changes in levels of gene expression and proteins, and for methods by which these responses can be
manipulated, such as RNAi silencing, gene overexpression or gene editing by CRISPR/Cas9. The Genetic
Models of Ocular Disease & Biostatistics core (formerly Molecular Genetics & Biostatistics) will continue to
provide DNA isolation services from patient blood samples, saliva and tissue and provide access for NEI
investigators to advanced statistical techniques to ensure use of appropriate methods both in study design and
for data analysis. Biostatistical services include analysis of complex gene expression arrays and RNA-seq
datasets, large proteomics studies, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography studies and
large patient population data sets from bioinformatics and clinical research studies. Two new services will provide
(1) genotyping of cell, tissue and biological samples from human, non-human primate, rat, mouse and pig tissues
and (2) provide assistance in establishing primary cell cultures from ocular tissues, as well as fibroblasts from
patients with ocular disease. Offering these new services will enable functional genotype-phenotype studies for
ocular disease, a critical enhancement in the current age of precision medicine. The Proteomics core will provide
access to advanced, high-throughput techniques for measuring changes in protein abundance and modification
with disease, determining how proteins fold and interact with one another, and how they regulate development.
All four cores are highly complementary and, in combination with new programs designed to encourage
communication between clinicians and basic scientists, will increase discoveries with greater direct benefit to
patients."
10875714,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementia (AD/ADRD) incidence is high in older adults
with stroke. There is a fundamental gap in understanding how vascular risk factors (VRFs) influence risk of
post-stroke AD/ADRD. Poor understanding of the biological factors driving post-stroke AD/ADRD risk is a critical barrier to the design of interventions aimed to protect the brain health of stroke survivors. The long-term
goal is to develop, test, and disseminate VRF interventions that reduce post-stroke AD/ADRD for diverse populations. The study objective is to quantify how VRFs influence post-stroke AD/ADRD risk to inform preventive interventions tailored to stroke survivors and inform clinical care and policies. Post-stroke AD/ADRD is an
excellent model of a serious, chronic illness of aging with high prevalence and costs. High blood pressure (BP),
diabetes, and high cholesterol are ideal biological VRFs because they are common and modifiable with a wide
range of effective therapies for management. Our central hypothesis is that post-stroke VRF levels contribute
to post-stroke AD/ADRD. The rationale for the proposed research is that knowing the impact of VRF levels
and stroke (sub)type on post-stroke AD/ADRD will improve our understanding of vascular biology and translate
into new and innovative approaches for prevention of post-stroke AD/ADRD. Guided by strong preliminary
data, this hypothesis will be tested through 3 specific aims: 1) Quantify the influence of post-stroke VRF levels
on post-stroke cognitive trajectories and AD/ADRD, and explore how sex and race affect these relationships;
2) Clarify the relationships between stroke subtype and post-stroke cognitive trajectories and AD/ADRD, and
explore how VRFs, sex, and race affect these relationships; and 3) Refine and expand an existing AD/ADRD-CVD computer simulation model by adding post-stroke AD/ADRD and results from Aims 1 and 2 to quantify
the subset of stroke events, sample size, and duration of trials that are adequately powered to find clinically
important and plausible effect sizes of VRF lowering on post-stroke AD/ADRD. The results of Aims 1 and 2
will be the identification of both VRF targets for interventions to reduce post-stroke AD/ADRD risk and the sub-groups of stroke survivors most likely to benefit from VRF lowering. The results of Aim 3 will be a new simulation model applicable to stroke survivors that can be used to inform clinical research trials, clinical care, and
policies. This research is innovative because it will ultimately yield a novel simulation model that could provide
new guidance that may change clinical practice and health policy for stroke survivors. The proposed study is
significant because it will generate new knowledge and methods to understand the impact of optimal VRF
treatment intensity on post-stroke AD/ADRD risk and improve the design of VRF lowering trials in stroke survivors. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to inform the development of targeted interventions to improve the prevention of post-stroke AD/ADRD and to reduce AD/ADRD-related disability in older Americans."
11009620,"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an alphavirus that has gained significant attention due to its ability to cause large
epidemics among susceptible populations and to be spread beyond endemic countries by international travelers.
Among a population of approximately 750,000 on the French island of La Reunion, 266,000 people were infected
and over 200 CHIKV-related fatalities occurred during the 2006 outbreak. Likewise, an estimated 1.4 million
people were infected with CHIKV in India during outbreaks that occurred from 2006 to 2007 and recently there
have been more than 1.7 million people infected with CHIKV in the Caribbean and the Americas. At present,
there is no commercial vaccine available for CHIKV. The development of an inactivated CHIKV vaccine suitable
for immunizing the general population as well as vulnerable groups including infants and the elderly represents
an important unmet clinical need. To address this critical unmet need, we have discovered a safe and
immunogenic peroxide-inactivated chikungunya virus vaccine, HydroVax-CHIKV. Importantly, this advanced
vaccine is safe and provides complete protection against infection and CHIKV-associated pathology in a robust
mouse model. Here, we propose a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 1 dose escalation trial
to evaluate the preliminary safety and immunogenicity of HydroVax-CHIKV. Our goal is to eventually provide
vaccine coverage to vulnerable populations and the successful completion of this study will represent a key
milestone in the advancement of a clinically relevant vaccine against chikungunya virus and provide a much-
needed approach to protect the most susceptible members of society including infants, elderly, and those with
potentially compromised immune functions."
10875751,"The Role of RNA Binding Protein Networks in Tauopathy and Related Dementia
Dementias, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and
related diseases, become a leading challenge in our progressively aging society. The presence of
tau protein-containing neurofibrillary tangles is a major neuropathological hallmark of AD and
related dementia. Although RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are emerging as critical players in these
neurodegenerative diseases, little is known about the RBP networks that control the balanced
expression of the human tau gene or other dementia-associated genes (DAGs). Based on
published studies and preliminary data, we propose to test the hypotheses that the RBP-tau
regulatory networks that maintain balanced tau alternative splicing and tau mRNA expression are
disrupted in tauopathies, leading to aberrant tau splicing and contributing to pathological tau
aggregation and neurodegeneration. We plan to leverage the vast RNA-seq and proteomics data
to construct RBP-tau gene regulatory networks and to use the newly developed human Tau knock-
in (hTauKI) mouse model together with patient samples and iPSC neurons to validate key players
contributing to the pathogenesis of dementia and related tauopathies. We will determine RBP
genes and networks affected in dementia by examining candidate AD-associated RBPs in
independent cohorts of patient samples using combined bioinformatics and molecular approaches
(Aim 1). We will characterize RBP-tau RNA interactome using the hTauKI mice and using iPSC-
derived neurons (Aim 2). We will determine the role of RBP-tau regulatory networks in tau
neurotoxicity by dissecting molecular mechanisms of candidate RBPs in regulating tau pre-mRNA
splicing and in tau pathogenesis (Aim 3). Our integrated multi-disciplinary approach combines
bioinformatics with state-of-art molecular/biochemical assays with the brand-new hTauKI mouse
model and iPSC-derived human neurons. This will enable us to construct RBP-tau regulatory
networks critical for normal brain function and for tau pathogenesis. The proposed study will not
only advance our understanding of complex post-transcriptional mechanisms regulating expression
of DAGs and provide mechanistic insights into the function of RBP-tau networks, but also lead to
information useful for developing new diagnostic and therapeutic tools for dementia."
10875765,"Early onset of age-related diseases, such as cardiometabolic disorders, inflammatory syndromes, and
neurodegenerative conditions, exact a large personal, economic, and societal toll and lead to shortened
healthspan and lifespan. Traumatic stress (trauma-related psychiatric symptoms) and genetic factors increase
the risk for an acceleration in the underlying pace of biological aging, as indicated by changes in peripheral
DNA methylation patterns (e.g., estimates of “epigenetic age”), increased inflammation, and metabolic
pathology. Alterations in these processes may hold predictive value for subsequent brain health. The aims of
this project are to examine traumatic stress-related accelerated aging in the periphery as an early predictor of
alterations in the neurochemistry of the brain and in neurocognitive performance over time. The study will also
examine genetic factors that may accentuate these associations. This project will build on two waves of
existing data, which include genotypes, psychological and neuropsychological assessments, and banked
plasma samples, by recruiting 160 participants in late middle age/early old age (all of whom have trauma
exposure and symptoms of traumatic stress) to return for a third assessment that is 5-15 years after baseline.
Participants will undergo cutting-edge magnetic resonance spectroscopy to asses for alterations in prefrontal
neurometabolites (including those relevant to neuroinflammation and neuronal viability, such as myo-inositol
and n-acetyl aspartate, respectively) and to examine neurocognitive performance, including assessment of
mild cognitive impairment. Banked DNA and plasma samples from the initial two time points, and new
peripheral samples from the third time point will be used to examine biomarkers that predict subsequent brain
health. The study will obtain measures of inflammation (e.g., cytokines) and neuropathology (e.g., amyloid
beta and total tau) using state-of-the-art Simoa® technology which yields extremely sensitive and precise
estimates of each analyte. Epigenome-wide DNA methylation will be obtained to examine accelerated
epigenetic age (i.e., when estimates of cellular age from established DNA methylation algorithms exceed
chronological age). Using longitudinal path analyses across the three time points of data, the study will
examine peripheral biomarkers (accelerated epigenetic age, inflammation, metabolic- and neuro-pathology) as
mediators of the association between prior traumatic stress and subsequent neural health. The study will
examine genetic variables, such as genome-wide risk scores for Alzheimer’s disease, cardiometabolic
pathology, and inflammation as well as genotypes relevant to dementia (i.e., in apolipoprotein or APOE) that
may moderate these associations. Ultimately, the study will identify early, peripheral prognostic markers of
subsequent accelerated aging in the brain, delineate the subpopulations at greatest risk by virtue of
psychiatric, genetic, and peripheral biomarker profiles, and substantially advance the science of accelerated
cellular aging across the periphery and brain."

10875709,"Project Summary
 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is typified by amyloid deposition in the brain, which provokes a robust microglial
mediated inflammatory response. Gene expression analysis of microglia in AD mouse models and patients has
revealed acquisition of a disease related gene expression signature that accompanies the morphological and
phenotypic changes exhibited by microglia associated with Aβ-plaques. It has only recently been appreciated
that the plaque associated microglia undergo a fundamental reprogramming of cellular metabolism necessary to
power the manifold phenotypic changes and cellular activities. Homeostatic microglia rely on mitochondrial
oxidative metabolism to generate ATP necessary for normal housekeeping. However, the plaque associated
microglia rapidly shift their metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis, which results in the
rapid (10-100 fold faster) generation of ATP necessary to power the microglia migration, proliferation,
phagocytosis and the envelopment of amyloid plaques exhibited by these cells. Increases in glycolysis are widely
acknowledged to be a hallmark of pro-inflammatory immune cell activation.
 The initial and rate limiting enzyme in glycolysis is hexokinase, however, in the brain only hexokinase 2 (HK2)
is expressed in microglia and are the only cell type in the brain to express this isoform. HK2 expression is directly
correlated with the rate of glycolysis and is induced in response to metabolic demand and subject to sophisticated
regulation. HK2 plays critical roles in inflammation through its actions in driving glycolysis, mediating the rapid
production of ATP necessary to power the immune response. We report that in the AD brain there is a significant
increase in the levels of HK2 selectively within plaque associated microglia and its expression is dependent upon
TREM2.
 We hypothesize that HK2 antagonism will act to sustain expression of the microglial homeostatic phenotype,
and prevent the transition to a neurodegenerative phenotype, attenuating disease progression. A primary goal
of these studies is to establish whether metabolic intervention strategies attenuate disease pathogenesis. The
specific aims are:
 Aim 1. Mechanisms of microglial regulation of HK2 expression and induction of glycolysis.
 We will establish the signaling pathways in microglia that regulate the expression of HK2 and the induction of
glycolysis and the mechanisms through which TREM2 influences HK2
 Aim 2 Conditional Inactivation of microglial HK2 in a murine model of AD
 We will selectively and inducibly inactivate HK2 expression in microglia in the 5XFAD model of AD and
evaluate if inhibition of HK2-dependent glycolysis affects AD pathogenesis and cognitive function.
 Aim 3. Evaluation of the therapeutic utility of a pharmacological inhibitor of HK2 in 5XFAD mice. We
will evaluate the efficacy of the hexokinase inhibitor, lonidamine (LND) on disease progression and behavior."
10875737,"Summary
Growing evidence suggests that extracellular vesicles (EVs), membrane vesicles that can be
secreted by most cell types to mediate intercellular communication, play important roles in the
initiation and or progression of Alzheimer disease (AD). Specifically, it has been demonstrated that
cell-to-cell transfer of amyloid beta (Aβ), tau, and other proteins critically involved in AD
pathogenesis, as well as the prion-like propagation of AD pathology within the central nervous
system (CNS) is mediated at least in part via EVs. Additionally, EVs carrying unique, disease-
specific, and functionally important cargo are detectable in vivo in blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
and other body fluids. More recently, we and others have demonstrated not only that EVs may
cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), though the transportation mechanism remains unclear, but
also that blood-based but CNS-specific EV molecules can be a valuable source of biomarkers for
neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. In this study, we will first use our advanced proteomics
techniques to screen for EV surface markers specific to AD-related neuronal subpopulations or brain
regions to identify more CNS- and AD- specific EV markers, and in parallel adapt our nanoparticle
sorting and single-molecule quantification technologies to enable high-purity isolation of CNS-derived
EVs in plasma and high-precision quantification of proteins in such EVs to address several major
challenges in the current field. Using the currently known (e.g., L1CAM) and more CNS- and AD-
specific, CNS-derived EV surface markers, as well as the existing and further developed EV isolation
and quantification technologies, we will then compare AD-related biomarkers in L1CAM-containing
EVs or those from AD-related neuronal subpopulations in blood plasma from human patients,
focusing on the performance of classic AD proteins and known EV candidates, specifically, Aβ, tau,
α-synuclein, and their various isoforms; additional novel targets may be studied when necessary. For
the verified AD-related EV proteins, we will further examine their longitudinal changes in animal
models and explore the mechanisms by which they are transported from the brain to blood (e.g.,
crossing BBB) in cellular and animal models and potential ways to alter them as novel future AD
treatment targets. The proposed experiments will likely establish the foundation leading to an
inexpensive and widely available test to aid in AD diagnosis and/or disease tracking. Additionally, the
proposed set of studies is an important initial step toward elucidating a novel potential clearance
pathway for potential toxic CNS protein species and ultimately it may provide critical opportunities for
therapeutically addressing the pathology associated with neurodegeneration in AD."
10839979,"Overview of the Proposed Resource – Abstract
The goal of the Center for Mesoscale Mapping is to drive the convergence of microscopic- and macroscopic-
scale evaluation of brain structure and function for human translational neuroscience, by developing and applying
tools to study the spatial distribution and temporal orchestration of mesoscopic events in the human brain. Our
Collaborators will, through a dynamic “push-pull” relationship, provide unique problems which drive the
development of these tools, and in return guide us in the design and optimization of our toolbox for practical use
in a variety of normal and disease settings. While there is still no formal consensus on the definition of
mesoscopic within the neuroscience community, we take as our guide the spatial and temporal scales at which
local groups of neurons act in coherent fashion – in the cortex, this includes the spatial scale of columns and
laminar structures (between ~0.1-1 mm), while in deeper structures includes the myriad of deep brain and
brainstem nuclei. Preliminary data from our own center, and of course others throughout the world, now support
the notion that we are on the threshold of being able to map, measure and perturb the human brain at these
scales, and do so comprehensively across wide swaths of the human brain. Temporally too, recent advances
suggest a convergence between temporal scales addressable with tools like fMRI, which can now investigate
delta frequency coherent phenomena, and advanced electromagnetic tools to measure and perturb coherent
electrophysiological activity at higher frequencies still. With this convergence in mind, the tools we proposed to
develop within the TRDs of the CMM will provide our Collaborative and Service User community with the
important “missing links” between the advances in human cognitive neuroscience at the “system level,” and the
enormous strides in cellular level circuit functional characterization. Our Collaborators will bring their own unique
challenges to help us define and further refine these tools, offering problems requiring distinct measures of
human brain structural and functional properties in a variety of normal and disease settings. Our Service Users
will utilize our tools to better understand human neural systems, and particularly human disease states from
multiple sclerosis to Alzheimer’s, to depression and epilepsy. Finally, our Center will seek to disseminate these
tools, through open-source software and hardware designs, industrial partnerships and “hands-on” teaching
courses for hardware, and to train a new generation of human neuroscientists in the use of our advanced tools
to explore the human brain at this next frontier."

10609966,"Abstract
Vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) is the second leading cause of dementia after Alzheimer’s disease.
Although the causes for VCID are not clear, increasing evidence suggests cerebral hypoperfusion is the dominant pathogenic
process. Cerebral hypoperfusion causes the death of oligodendrocytes, the only myelin (the key component in nerve fiber)
producing cells in CNS, leading to white matter injury (WMI) which is closely related to VCID. Thus, interventions targeted
at WMI—an area that remains poorly understood—may provide a new therapy for both WMI and VCID. We have
successfully reprogrammed reactive astrocytes into oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (iOPCs) by three transcription factors
(named SOA) in ischemic brain. Reprogrammed OPCs can proliferate/differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes, repair
WMI and improve sensorimotor and cognitive function. Thus, we intend to test the therapeutic potential of reprogrammed
oligodendrocytes in WM restoration and in cognitive dysfunction/memory loss in mouse models that mimic common carotid
artery (CCA) hypoperfusion caused by arteriosclerotic CCA stenosis. The central hypothesis is that in situ
reprogramming of activated astrocytes into oligodendrocytes can restore white matter integrity and improve long-
term cognitive recovery in VCID models induced by CCA hypoperfusion. The following three Aims are proposed:
Aim 1 will characterize the maturity of reprogrammed OPCs and their role in WM restoration in CCA hypoperfusion models
in both genders and the underlaying mechanism whether reprogrammed OPCs enhance WM restoration by enhancing axonal
remyelination and stimulating axonal sprouting. Aim 2 will test if iOPCs enhance long-term sensorimotor and cognitive
function as well as axonal function in the needle CCA hypoperfusion model in young and aged mice. Aim 3 will test if ICV
administration of recombinant SOA pool protein can reprogram reactive astrocytes into oligodendrocytes, restore WM
integrity, and improve cognitive recovery in a needle CCA hypoperfusion model. The proposed study is the first to
reprogram astrocytes in situ into viable oligodendrocytes and will provide a novel therapeutic approach for WMI and VCID
as well other CNS diseases that involve WMI."
10875697,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Biologic sex influences Alzheimer's disease (AD) and whether sex chromosomes play a role is unknown. This
grant focuses on X-chromosome-derived mechanisms of sex difference that contribute to AD by integrating
mouse model and human studies. Understanding this largely unstudied area may reveal new X-based pathways
that could ultimately benefit both sexes. Sex differences in AD reveal differing vulnerabilities in men and women.
In brief, male sex is a risk factor for rapid progression to death in AD and other neurodegenerative conditions.
These findings support the fact that many more women have AD, due in part to their longevity and also to their
increased risk or incidence in older age – which together contributes to a higher lifetime risk of AD in women.
One major source of biologic difference between the sexes is that females have two X chromosomes and males
have one. Using genetic models of sex biology that dissect effects of gonadal development, sex chromosomes,
and X and Y chromosome dose, we found that the second X chromosome counters mortality, deficits and
toxicity related to hAPP/Aβ in both male and female mice and primary neurons, without altering levels of Aβ
or co-pathogenic proteins. Since one X inactivates in females, X dose is largely similar between the sexes. This
raises a key question: why would having two X's confer advantage to AD-related measures? While X
chromosome inactivation (XCI) silences one X chromosome in XX cells, a small subset of X-linked genes escape
XCI. Of these, Kdm6a (Utx), a H3K27-demethylase, robustly and consistently escapes in both mice and humans,
causes cognitive deficits in humans with loss of function mutations, and plays a post-developmental role in
synaptic plasticity and cognition. In further studies we identified that a second X chromosome confers
resilience to AD-related deficits, in part, through increasing Kdm6a. Furthermore, the X chromosome
escapee KDM6A may be relevant to human brain health since a genetic variant links to increased expression of
its gene product – and that variant assocaties with slower cognitive decline in a population of individuals
transitioning to AD. We hypothesize that the X chromosome escapee Kdm6a contributes sex difference and
confers resilience to AD and AD-related measures. Specifically, we will test how Kdm6a causes resilience – and
probe its molecular pathways. The complimentary clinical arm of this proposal enables us to examine key
associations of KDM6A in sex differences of human populations of aging and AD with existing cognitive and
biomarker data. Answers to our questions in mice and humans will fundamentally advance mechanistic
understanding of sex-based heterogeneity of AD, and will likely pave X-based paths toward urgently needed
treatments in AD, personalized for men, women, or both."
10875729,"Summary
 In response to PA-17-088, “Secondary Analyses of Existing Cohorts, Data Sets and Stored Biospecimens
to Address Clinical Aging Research Questions (R01)”, we propose integrating existing GWAS summary data of
Alzheimer's disease (AD) with existing proteomic and metabolomic quantitative trait locus (pQTL/mQTL) data to
identify proteins and metabolites putatively causal to AD. The overarching goal is to both boost statistical power
and enhance interpretability for causal inference in the post-GWAS era by leveraging many published large-scale
GWAS summary association datasets and omic data. In an emerging and increasingly inﬂuential approach called
transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), by integrating GWAS summary data with gene expression (or
eQTL) data, one aims to improve over the current practice of GWAS to not only increase statistical power to
identify more genetic variants associated with GWAS traits, but also link the (non-coding) genetic variants to
their target genes, thus gaining insights into the genetic basis of common diseases and complex traits. In practice,
however, TWAS may fail to identify true causal genes while giving false positives due to the violation of its modeling
assumptions (e.g. due to LD or horizontal pleiotropy of SNPs). We ﬁrst propose three new methods to check
possible violations of modeling assumptions in TWAS, then propose two more robust and powerful approaches
that improve over the standard TWAS. Next, we extend TWAS to xWAS to integrate GWAS with proteomic and
metabolomic traits (i.e. pQTL and mQTL), to identify (putatively) causal proteins and metabolites, analogous to
detecting causal genes/transcripts in TWAS. We apply the new (and existing) methods to integrate large-scale
GWAS summary data of AD and atrial ﬁbrillation (AF) with pQTL and mQTL to identify putatively causal proteins
and metabolites for AD and AF respectively, and to investigate whether AF is causal to AD, thus not only advancing
our understanding of the etiology of AD and AF, but also possibly offering modiﬁable targets for interventions on
the two devastating diseases. Finally, we will develop and disseminate publicly available software implementing
the proposed analysis methods, e.g. as R packages, to facilitate the wide use by the scientiﬁc community."
10875707,"A hallmark feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles that are
composed of the microtubule-associated protein Tau. Moreover, aggregates of this protein are found in a variety
of other neurodegenerative diseases, together referred to as Tauopathies, underscoring the central role of this
protein in the pathogenesis of these neurodegenerative diseases. Although originally identified as a microtubule-
binding protein, Tau has now been connected with a variety of functions and accordingly it has also been
localized to various cellular compartments, including the nucleus. In AD patients, Tau can form paired helical
filaments in the nucleus and its function in the nucleus, as in other compartments, seems to be regulated by
phosphorylation. Loss of Tau results in a decrease of heterochromatin and changes in heterochromatin,
chromosomal mis-segregations and aberrations have been described in AD patients. Furthermore, Tau can
protect DNA from damage induced by radiation, radical formation, or stress and again DNA damage is also
observed in AD patients. However, Tau may also actively regulate transcription. In addition to binding to double-
stranded DNA in a sequence-independent way, Tau can bind to single stranded DNA in a sequence-specific
manner, suggesting that it might interact with transcriptional complexes to regulate transcription. However, at
this time it is still widely unknown how disease-associated changes in Tau affect these functions and how this
could contribute to the pathogenesis. Using novel human Tau knock-in Drosophila models, we found that two
Tauopathy-causing mutation in Tau, hTauV337M and TauK369I, lead to increased vulnerability to radiation and age-
induced DNA damage. Furthermore, they increase heterochromatin formation in comparison to knock-in flies
expressing normal human Tau. We therefore propose to use these models to address the hypothesis that the
increased DNA damage triggers cell cycle re-entry of neurons that then results in apoptosis or cellular
senescence, providing a mechanism for the neurodegeneration and behavioral deficits we observed in these
models. In addition, we will perform sequencing experiments to determine how this alters chromatin accessibility
and the neuronal transcriptome. Defining mechanisms and pathways that are affected by changes in the nuclear
functions of disease-associated Tau could provide critical new insight into the underlying causes of Tau
pathologies, which in turn can be used to develop treatment strategies.
Public Heath Relevance: Although it is well-known that Tau plays a crucial role in the pathology of Tauopathies,
the recent findings that Tau is a multifunctional protein with many other functions than microtubule-binding, has
opened a new avenue for identifying mechanism causing or contributing to these diseases. In this proposal, we
are focusing on nuclear functions of Tau and how their disruptions may cause neuronal dysfunctions and changes
in the transcriptome. This may therefore identify novel targets for developing treatment strategies that can prevent
or delay the progression of these diseases."
10847407,"PROGRAM SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The Midwest Consortium for Hazardous Waste Worker Training (MWC) provides model training programs
to workers and residents who may be exposed to hazardous substances. This programming is delivered by 13
training centers in 9 states: Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, Ohio, Tennessee,
and Wisconsin. Eight of the centers are equipment-based centers that focus most strongly on HAZWOPER
and related training for workers at designated hazardous waste sites; treatment, storage, and disposal
facilities; and in a broad range of emergency response roles. The five remaining centers are community-based
centers that focus on helping workers and residents, particularly those from underserved populations, to
recognize and react to hazardous materials in their communities. From 2015-2019, MWC training centers
provided 4,791 programs to 75,354 trainees for 521,407 contact hours, demonstrating the impressive reach of
the Consortium.
 The long-term goal of the MWC is to improve occupational and environmental health and safety throughout
the region it serves. In the shorter-term, the MWC's objective is to build capacity for workers to improve the
workplace and for communities of workers and residents to recognize, prepare for, and recover from
environmental exposures. To achieve this objective, the overall aims for the MWC are to facilitate delivery of
model training programs at MWC centers, enable training of diverse groups of participants who will not
otherwise receive enough training about hazardous substances, and continually evaluate and improve the
delivery of the MWC's worker and community training. Achieving these aims will allow the MWC to continue to
develop and implement innovative training, address emerging topics such as opioids and worker health, and
extend community resilience training to a broader context as needs arise.
 The experienced, creative, and dedicated trainers at MWC centers have successfully trained hundreds of
thousands of workers since 1987, increasing the collective training output over time and demonstrating
impressive impacts. The centers provide training to workers at industrial sites, government agencies, tribal
nations, healthcare systems, and elsewhere and to residents affiliated with faith-based groups, non-profit and
community organizations, and neighborhood associations. Reported impacts of training demonstrate significant
benefits to public health, particularly in the prevention and control of hazards. Participants indicate that they
learn how to act more safely, and return to their workplaces and communities after training with a motivation to
implement new procedures so that fundamental change will occur. From 2020-2025, MWC training centers will
collectively provide 4,864 programs to 82,009 trainees during 703,571 contact hours."

The extensive water networks of the United States maritime industry carry over 65 percent of
the products transported in and around the country. Every United States region has supply lines
to navigable waterways and/or coastal or inland ports that are used to transport these goods. To
date, training for workers within and ancillary to the maritime industry that handle hazardous
materials as well as training related to worker safety, disaster preparedness and response have
been limited. Over nearly a decade, Project South East Area Maritime Industry Safety Training
(SEAMIST), a Hazardous Waste Worker Training Program (HWWTP) and Project Hazardous
Material Maritime Industry Response Training Initiative (HazMIRTSI), a Hazmat Preparedness
Disaster Training Program (HPDTP), funded by a cooperative agreement with the National
Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) has addressed this unmet need.
Specifically, Project SEAMIST provides health and safety training for personnel whose jobs may
bring them into contact with hazardous materials in ports. To date, we have trained
approximately 7,000 participants, logging close to 70,000 contact hours and targeting several
occupational areas in the maritime industry within Florida, Louisiana, Virginia, Alabama,
Mississippi, Texas, Georgia, South Carolina, New York, and California. Building on this, Project
HazMIRTSI trained approximately 1,000 first responders to effectively handle disasters on our
waterways, especially involving hazardous waste, as well as the general population on how to
safely respond and provide clean-up after disasters. Project HazMIRTSI has extended our
presence from the Gulf and Atlantic states to the northern Atlantic states of Massachusetts,
Connecticut, New Jersey, Maine, Delaware, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. Both projects
have been able to reach a nationwide audience and have used innovative training approaches
and state-of-the-art technologies, with flexibility to continuously adapt and evolve the curriculum
to fit the needs of trainees. Going forward, we aim to provide safety and hazardous
preparedness training to over 9,000 maritime workers in both English and Spanish, provide
disaster response training for 3,000 skilled response personnel, provide new disaster
preparedness training for 1,000 community members and continue to revise, optimize and
enhance our training curricula and evaluation protocols. Both projects aim to resolve the lack of
economical and specialized training courses available to the maritime industry. Our safety
training courses reduce and possibly eliminate incidences of injuries and deaths among
maritime workers, the community, and responders during and after disasters."

The purpose of the Yale Cooperative Center of Excellence in Hematology (YCCEH) is to facilitate and
enhance research by investigators engaged in nonmalignant hematology-related research. Our unique
focus is the application of emerging technologies to the study of normal and perturbed hematopoiesis. This
includes understanding stem cell biology, hematopoiesis, including the processes of self renewal,
expansion and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells, through intermediate progenitor and precursor
stages, to mature differentiated and functional blood cells of different lineages. Members of our Research
Base are actively engaged in a wide range of topics in the field of hematology, from the stem cell to the
bone marrow microenvironment, from understanding mechanisms of hematologic disease to development
of novel therapeutic strategies for inherited and acquired disorders, from transfusion of red blood cells and
platelets to study of related complications. In parallel, specific technologies utilized across the YCCEH
reflect this diversity, with techniques from many fields utilized including cell signaling, genomics,
proteomics, RNA biology, molecular biology, advanced imaging and microscopy, to better understand
hematologic processes. The resources and environment of the Yale University School of Medicine have
been and continue to be particularly well suited to the Center because of the interests and expertise of
many of its faculty in the areas of hematology, stem cell biology, genomic analyses and bioinformatics.
The availability of a large range of existing core facilities at Yale that directly interface with the YCCEH’s
cores, such as the Yale Stem Cell Center, the Yale Center for Genome Analysis, the Yale Center for
Clinical Investigation, the Yale Center for Medical Informatics, the Yale Center for High-Performance
Computation in Biomedicine, the Yale Systems Biology Institute and the newly established DeLuca Center
for Research in Hematology further synergize hematology research across the university. Together, these
resources support numerous critical core facilities relevant to hematology investigators. The YCCEH will
continue to serve our Research Base (both at Yale and external) by providing training and expertise
through the Emerging Technology Research Cores, while providing enhanced opportunities for education
and interactions through the Enrichment Core. The Emerging Technology Research Cores will not only
enhance research by providing access to cutting edge technologies, but also improve cost-effectiveness
of supported research. The long term goal of the YCCEH is to play a key role in the integrated program of
hematologic diseases-related research support provided by other NIDDK Cooperative Centers of
Excellence in Hematology by providing opportunities to promote increased collaboration within our
Research Base and with investigators at other institutions, supporting a broad and deep hematologic
diseases research base."
10875712,"Project Summary/ Abstract
The mechanism underlying progressive memory loss and cognitive deterioration in Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
is not fully understood and effective approaches to prevent or reverse memory deficits are unavailable. Here
we show that augmentation of hippocampal neurogenesis in a mouse model of familial Alzheimer’s disease
(FAD) reverses deficits in spatial recognition. Notably, new neurons are recruited into the memory circuit and
serve as part of the engram during memory acquisition and retrieval. The number of new neurons in the
engram of FAD mice is reduced compared to wild type. However, it is significantly increased following
augmentation of neurogenesis. Importantly, new neurons encompass the majority of engram cells during
memory retrieval. Thus, this project will test the hypothesis that new neurons play a major role in the engram and
that increasing hippocampal neurogenesis in FAD restores the engram and rescues learning and memory. By
manipulating levels of neurogenesis in FAD mouse models and using engram labeling techniques,
experiments in Aim 1 will establish the role of new hippocampal neurons in the engram in FAD. Experiments
in Aim 2 will determine the role of neurogenesis in memory retrieval in FAD. Aim 3 will unravel the signaling
pathways underlying impaired hippocampal neurogenesis and engram function in AD. Aim 4 will examine
the association between Alzheimer’s pathological hallmarks and the Engram. This program is designed to
establish the role of hippocampal neurogenesis in cognitive deficits in AD and determine the efficacy of
augmented neurogenesis in rescuing learning and memory in this disorder."
10795700,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
More than 40 million Americans seek emergency care after traumatic stress exposure (TSE) each year. A
substantial proportion of these individuals are at risk for chronic pain development and comorbid opioid
use/misuse. Those at high risk of developing chronic pain can easily be identified (e.g., by severity of acute pain),
creating tens of millions of opportunities each year for the prevention of chronic pain and associated opioid
use/misuse. However, no interventions exist that prevent chronic pain development in those at high risk. In fact,
current medications either have no effect on risk or actually increase risk.
 Therapeutic targets for post-TSE pain have historically focused on tissue injury-related pain generators, but
increasing evidence suggests that physiologic systems involved in the stress response play a critical role in
chronic pain development after TSE, opening up an exciting new landscape of potential therapeutic targets.
Within this landscape, no target appears more promising than FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51), an
intracellular protein known to affect glucocorticoid negative feedback inhibition. The investigators’ data
demonstrate that FKBP51 inhibition reverses hyperalgesia after TSE, and suggest that FKBP51 inhibition after
TSE can prevent enduring stress-induced hyperalgesia (ESIH). The investigators’ data further demonstrate that
the effects of FKBP51 inhibition on ESIH after TSE are time, dosing, and duration-dependent. Available literature
indicate that increased FKBP51 levels are associated not only with chronic pain after TSE, but also with other
post-traumatic neuropsychiatric disorders often comorbid with chronic pain and opioid use/abuse, including
posttraumatic stress, depression, and anxiety. Importantly, preliminary data from the investigative team indicate
that FKBP51 inhibition does not have adverse cardiac effects or other adverse health or behavioral effects.
 Building on these data, the investigative team will perform the next critical steps in evaluating FKBP51 as a
therapeutic target, including (1) evaluating the influence of dose, timing, and duration of FKBP51 inhibition after
TSE on ESIH development, (2) assessing candidate mechanisms mediating the preventive effect of FKBP51
inhibition on chronic pain development, and (3) performing extensive testing of safety and addiction liability. All
experiments will be performed across laboratories, animal models, pain measures, animal species, and animal
sex and age, by a multidisciplinary team of experts in human and animal ESIH, animal behavior and addiction
studies, FKBP51 biology, and FKBP51 inhibition. Completion of these experiments will substantively advance
understanding of a target with exciting potential to prevent chronic pain and opioid use/misuse in millions of
Americans who seek care in the early aftermath of traumatic stress exposures such as motor vehicle collision,
sexual assault, and physical assault each year."
11128119,"Opioid misuse is epidemic in the United States and is associated with alarming rates of overdose and
overdose deaths. Additionally, opioid misuse is associated with innumerable costs to individuals, families,
communities, and society. Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) in combination with psychosocial intervention,
is the most effective treatment for OUDs; however, many individuals are unable to access treatment, are not
sufficiently retained in treatment, or experience barriers that prohibit their participation in substance use
disorder (SUD) treatment. Solutions to the opioid crisis will require an “all hands on deck” approach which
includes the provision of effective pharmacological treatment coupled with formal treatment as well as critical
recovery support services tailored to individual needs. As such, it is critical to 1. develop integrated networks of
care, both formal and informal, to better address the needs of individuals with OUDs, and 2. to measure the
efficacy of these integrated networks for addressing the needs of individuals with OUDs. This proposed project
will bring together a diverse set of OUD treatment system stakeholders that work to build a learning
collaborative to address gaps in knowledge about the delivery, sustainability, and assessment of recovery
service for individuals on MAT and to foster collaboration and communication between these stakeholders and
with the larger community of research and providers interested in improving the delivery of OUD recovery
support services (OUD-RSS)."
10849851,"Overall HWWT and HDP Project Summary The ICWUC seeks to continue its national multi union training
program to protect a range of collateral duty emergency responders and disaster workers and develop a
cadre of worker trainers by offering 496 classes to 7,258 trainees (HWWT) and 246 classes to 3,657 trainees
(HDP). Our goal is to have active, informed workers and trainers on the front lines of handling toxic
substances to recognize the danger of spills, leaks, exposure to highly infectious agents, disasters and
catastrophic releases, protect themselves and improve their workplaces. To accomplish this, we use a range
of adult education principles and techniques that rely on the knowledge and experiences of the participants
to teach key principles in a non-threatening and engaging method that motivates trainees to improve their
worksites.
We will include two new partners, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees
(AFSCME), the largest public sector union and the Association of Occupational and Environmental Clinics
(AOEC), a national network of experienced occupational health professional with a range of expertise in
chemical and biological exposures and health effects. We will launch a major initiative to conduct Spanish
and bilingual classes and develop bilingual worker trainers to deliver training on a range of disaster hazards.
We will continue to develop worker trainers, offer hazmat classes to industrial, health care, government and
school workers. We will continue our Plume Software and exposure to highly infectious disease classes,
authorize trainers and staff in OSHA classes and continue our work with other NIEHS Grantees.
The ICWUC Center will continue to collect pre and 6 months post-training survey data of participants'
attempts to change their workplaces (which has resulting in two published papers). By comparing this paired
data source for the same individuals, this has indicated that the intervention of the ICWU Center's program
motivates, educates and arms these workers with skills to return to their worksite and make improvements
in site safety plans and procedures. Two other papers documented joint labor/management programs to
train all site workers and track improvements. We will explore the role of worker trainers as site experts
outside the classroom."

The Deep South Center for Environmental Justice, Inc. Hazardous Waste Worker Training Center provides
training to hazardous materials and wastes workers who may perform jobs covered by the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response
(HAZWOPER) standards and assist employers in complying with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120.
The Consortium's goal is unique as its emphasis is on underserved populations in its Hazardous Waste
Worker Training Program (HWWTP) and Environmental Careers Worker Training Program (ECWTP); and
populations critical to post-disaster recovery in its Hazmat Disaster Preparedness Training Program (HDPTP).
 The proposed HWWTP is designed to provide model occupational safety and health training for
workers who are or may be engaged in activities related to hazardous waste removal, containment or
chemical response. The emphasis is on servicing workers of entities where health and safety training are
critical to the worker’s wellbeing. These workers include emergency responders and small
municipality city workers and or cities where budgeting restraints or working conditions, greatly reduces
or eliminates the possibility of training. Volunteer fire departments and small county police forces, city
health department employees, port authority workers, mosquito control employees, HBCUs, small
minority and disadvantaged businesses are workers the Consortium has trained.
 The proposed ECWTP component is designed to deliver comprehensive worker training to increase
the number of underrepresented and disadvantaged minority adults employed in the fields of
environmental restoration, hazardous materials and construction. The p r o g r a m goals are: (1) to serve
underrepresented and disadvantaged adults living near hazardous waste and or contaminated property
at risk of exposure to ambient hazards; (2) to provide additional pre-employment services inclusive of
study skills, math, reading, life skills to increase program retention and completion; and (3) to successfully
place trainers in jobs in the environmental restoration and construction fields.
 The proposed HDPTP, as an extension of the HWWTP, is designed to deliver safety and health training
to hazardous materials and chemical workers responding to a disaster. The emphasis is on pre-incident
preparedness and response training critical for workers still in need of training after responding to past disasters
(i.e. Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Sandy and Harvey). In addition, the program delivers training to a population
identified as crucial to the continued recovery of communities including homeowners, volunteers, small
businesses, and church-based organization members and leaders in disaster-affected areas such as New Orleans,
LA (post-Katrina), Houston, TX (post-Harvey) and New York (post-Sandy)."

This is a proposal for a regional health and safety training program to be implemented by The New England
Consortium-Civil Service Employees Association (TNEC-CSEA), a partnership between the University of
Massachusetts Lowell (UML), four New England coalitions for occupational safety and health (COSH groups)
in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New Hampshire, and CSEA, Local 1000 AFSCME, in New
York. Since 1987, TNEC-CSEA has trained 52,477 workers in 3,294 courses, for a total of 597,068 contact
hours with NIEHS grant support. TNEC-CSEA will train workers exposed to hazardous materials; responding
to disasters and post-event cleanups; at risk for workplace injuries and the misuse of opioids; and workers from
underserved populations through high quality training based on evidence-based science and best practices in
worker health and safety (H&S) and adult education. It draws on its strength as a consortium of a university,
non-profit worker advocacy organizations, and a large union of public sector workers to network and build
relationships with a multitude of government, university, business and non-profit stakeholders. TNEC-CSEA
uses proven adult education methods that are hands-on, small-group, learner-centered, and worker
empowerment oriented to maximize its impact on workplace H&S. TNEC-CSEA will train 4,066 workers
annually over five years in the HWWTP and HDPTP projects in New York and the six New England states. Its
target populations are: 200,000 workers in manufacturing, health care, hazardous materials response and
remediation, environmental, construction, and utilities; and 300,000 workers in the public sector, in
transportation, public safety, public works, health care, and environmental jobs, including federal, state,
county, and municipal employees with focuses on underserved immigrant workers, job training, worker centers
and tribal entities in New England. TNEC-CSEA seeks to expand and strengthen its program through new
innovations in blended learning, infectious disease, disaster preparedness, climate change and chemical safety,
and with a focus of training vulnerable/underserved populations and those most at risk for injury and opioid
use disorder. TNEC-CSEA training will continue to prevent injuries, illnesses and fatalities in thousands of
workplaces by linking the best available science for worker protection with stakeholders in its network of
union, safety and governmental professionals, public health and environmental justice organizations, worker
and job training centers, and tribal entities. It will use its advisory boards and highly skilled staff, experienced
in adult education and worker H&S, to translate knowledge about a broad range of H&S problems – from
hazardous materials to opioids to climate change and disasters – and protective and preventive interventions
in the workplace into practice. The Consortium will do this through direct training of workers and trainers,
supporting the worker H&S movement, and linking stakeholders together in creative and fundamental ways."

Background: Veterans Health Administration (VHA) created a Veterans Crisis Line (VCL) as a 24-hour point
of contact for Veterans who are at high-risk for suicide. There is a paucity of research on the potential impact of
VCL interventions and a need to examine the use of emergency dispatches (i.e., 911) because of their life-
saving potential and possible negative consequences.
Significance/Impact: The study examines the potential impact of VCL initiated emergency dispatches on
critical outcomes among VCL callers who are at high risk for suicide. It responds to the President’s Roadmap
to Empower Veterans and End a National Tragedy of Suicide (PREVENTS) and the HSR&D (HX-19-004)
Targeted Solicitation for Health Services Research on Veteran Suicide Prevention.
Innovation: The study will involve the first analyses to link VHA databases to examine the associations of
emergency dispatches with critical outcomes and obtain Veterans’ and responders’ experiences with
emergency dispatches.
Specific Aims:
Aim 1: Determine the association of an emergency dispatch with suicide deaths. Objectives are to 1a)
identify key correlates of receiving an emergency dispatch, 1b) determine the association of emergency
dispatch with treatment engagement within 30-days, and 1c) risk for suicide death over 365 days. We expect
an emergency dispatch to be associated with higher treatment engagement (H1) and lower risk for suicide
deaths (H2).
Aim 2: Determine the association of agreeing to receive an emergency dispatch with combined suicide
deaths and attempts. Objectives are to 2a) identify key correlates of agreeing to the dispatch, 2b) determine
the association of agreement with treatment engagement within 30 days, and 2c) risk for combined suicide
deaths and attempts over 365 days. We expect caller agreement with an emergency dispatch to be associated
with higher treatment engagement (H3) and lower risk for combined suicide deaths and attempts (H4).
Aim 3: Explore the experiences of Veteran VCL callers who receive and responders who initiate
emergency dispatches. Objectives are to 3a) gather data on Veterans’ experiences with the call, emergency
dispatch, and subsequent care, 3b) gather data on responder experiences initiating emergency dispatches,
and 3c) identify potential improvements in emergency dispatch policy and measurement.
Methodology: Quantitative analyses will examine key correlates of emergency dispatches and agreement,
and their prospective associations with treatment engagement and suicide outcomes. Qualitative interviews
with Veteran callers and VCL responders will be used to understand their experiences with emergency
dispatches, evaluate the ecological validity of quantitative findings and inform policy and research.
Implementation/Next Steps: Findings will be presented to Veteran stakeholders and VCL leadership and
responders to identify potential policy changes and variables that should be measured for future research.
They may also contribute to research on implementing new emergency dispatch procedures across VCL sites."
10849813,"Program Summary/Abstract
 The International Union, UAW and its partners propose to address three problems. The first
is the potential for illness and injury directly or indirectly related to hazardous material
exposure. The second is occupational and environmental health disparities, particularly as they
affect the Hispanic/Latino population of Southeast Michigan. The third problem is the opioid
epidemic, an emerging environmental health issue.
 To address the first problem, we will continue development of an ongoing program whose
paramount goal is to prevent illnesses and injuries by providing training on health and safety
topics that are directly or indirectly related to elimination and/or reduction of potential
exposure to hazardous materials. UAW members throughout the United States are exposed to a
wide variety of hazards. Manufacturing workers can face exposure to carcinogens, such as
welding fume and hexavalent chromium and emerging hazards, such as engineered
nanomaterials (ENM). Members employed in casinos are often heavily exposed to carcinogenic
tobacco smoke. In healthcare and academic labs, union members can be exposed to bloodborne
pathogens, sterilants, radioactive isotopes and/or emerging hazards, such as ENM. The UAW
has established a partnership with the University of Puerto Rico to provide training to the
union’s six thousand active members on the island who are still dealing with the aftermath of
Hurricane Maria.
 The second problem is occupational and environmental health disparities in Southeast
Michigan, where the Hispanic/Latino population includes many who are disadvantaged by
environmental injustice, less formal education, limited English proficiency, and/or limited
access to training. The UAW is working with two partners who serve the Hispanic/Latino
communities in Southeast Michigan, Catholic Charities of Southeast Michigan – Hispanic
Outreach Services (CCSEM/HOS) and La Casa Guadalupana. Many in these populations are
exposed to pesticides when doing landscaping or agricultural work, silica and other dust when
working in construction and/or toxic cleaning solvents when working in housekeeping or
childcare. Some work outdoors, where they are exposed to temperature extremes, UV radiation
and/or air pollutants. They may work 6-7 days per week in jobs characterized by seasonal
instability, shifting hours, low pay and physically harmful or dangerous work conditions.
 The third problem is the opioid crisis, which has affected many UAW members, especially in
manufacturing.
 In the first year of the grant, the UAW and its partners together propose to train 2,661
participants in 163 programs for a total of 20,442 contact hours. The five-year totals would be
13,305 participants in 815 programs for a total of 102,210 contact hours. The consortium
proposes to address the potential for illness and injury directly or indirectly related to hazardous
material exposure by conducting training in health and safety. We will address occupational
and environmental health disparities by continuing and expanding collaborative partnerships
with community groups and other NIEHS-WTP grantees for the purpose of delivering health
and safety training to underserved populations. The opioid crisis will be addressed by
developing and delivering population-specific curricula that address treatment and prevention
of opioid addiction, including alternatives for pain management. In addition, we propose to
develop, pilot, evaluate, and scale a peer recovery support program that will help workers seek
services to address opioid addiction.
 All of the above programs will be evaluated to provide feedback for continual improvement of
curricula and delivery methods. This will include monitoring trainee perceptions of quality,
appropriateness, and usefulness as well as assessing new curricula and training delivery
methods; evaluating the long-term impact of training on worker and organizational outcomes
using innovative and conventional quantitative and qualitative evaluation methods. Worker-
evaluators will be incorporated into evaluation when possible."
10850877,"The Sustainable Workplace Alliance (SWA) and its alliance partners will provide model training to better
protect workers, first responders and citizens in underserved communities that have been negatively impacted
by pollution, blight and emergency events. These vulnerable populations are unlikely to know their rights to a
safe workplace, the inherent risks of the work they do, the dangers of misuse of opioids, the hazards created
by pollution or hazardous materials, and the most effective ways to protect themselves from these harms.
Special emphasis will be given to training and placing underserved citizens in jobs that involve cleanup of the
nation’s hazardous waste infrastructure, especially within the communities they live in. Additionally, SWA will
focus on reaching Hispanic workers, the hazards of coal ash exposure and the opioid epidemic and its
negative effect on worker health.
SWA and its alliance partners will focus is on English and Spanish-speaking populations in Florida, Puerto
Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands and the Pacific Island regions including Hawaii, Guam, Saipan, American Samoa and
Palau. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, worker populations in our geographic targets include over
83,600 workers in construction (hazardous materials removal and laborer), and nearly 94,000 workers serving
as first responders, including fire, police and paramedics.
Over five years, SWA will conduct 749 classes, train 7,015 students and cover 119,320 contact hours. Of the
students trained, 200 will be placed in viable environmental or construction related jobs. Additionally, 135 of
these students will receive HAZWOPER train-the-trainer instruction and it is expected that these new trainers
will go back to work and train 1,350 workers, bringing the total number of direct and tier two workers benefitting
from this training program to 8,365.
Students would typically be employed as remediation contractors, site demolition workers, debris removal and
post-emergency cleanup workers; laborers who work with mold, asbestos, and lead-based paint; and
abatement workers performing work at Superfund or brownfield sites. The first responder audience would
include fire (career and volunteer), police and paramedics, with a specific focus on rural responders.
Additionally, we are targeting CERT (Community Emergency Response Teams) members, LEPC (Local
Emergency Planning Committee) members and first receivers at hospitals.
This model training and outreach program is designed to reduce injuries and death has an obvious positive
effect on public health. Secondly, by placing disadvantaged citizens in viable jobs in the environmental and
construction industries, both emotional and economic well-being will improve for the student, their family and
their community."
10875741,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by aggregation of β-amyloid
(Aβ) peptides, neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau, and a progressive loss of cognitive
function. While much is known regarding the biochemical composition and structure of amyloid and tau in AD,
relatively less focus has been placed on the intracellular handling of detrimental protein products, and more
specifically, how upstream deficits in organelle function can accelerate the disease process and directly
contribute to memory impairments. While neurons rely on dedicated organelles to execute specific functions and
sustain health, several in particular have been linked to AD pathophysiology, including the ER, which is important
for protein assembly and intracellular calcium signaling; lysosomes, which are critical for breaking down and
removing the cellular debris and misfolded proteins collected by authophagosomes; and mitochondria, which are
responsible for the bioenergetics of the cell (Mustaly et al., 2018). In the global operations of maintaining
neuronal viability, the functions of these organelles are highly inter-dependent, and they are often physically
coupled to one another. Despite the close coupling, their respective roles in contributing to AD have typically
been studied in isolation. For example, there are compelling studies detailing aspects of ER, lysosome, or
mitochondrial dysfunction in AD, yet substantially less is understood about how altered interactions among these
organelles can lead to pathogenic cascades. This isolationist approach may lead to critical oversights in
understanding key processes in AD and missing potential therapeutic opportunities. Thus, the overall goal of
this study is to identify mechanisms underlying deficiencies in specific organelle functions and examine how this
affects their interactions, characterize how this potentiates AD pathology, and establish the upstream drivers of
this cascade for consideration as a therapeutic target. This will be accomplished through the following Aims: Aim
I: Determine if the AD-associated disruption in ER function disrupts lysosomal dynamics and clearance of
aggregated proteins. Aim II: Determine the mechanism by which excess ER-Ca2+ release disrupts mitochondrial
function and degradation. Aim III: Establish upstream drivers of intracellular pathogenic cascades and determine
if targeting ER-homeostasis will resolve lysosomal and mitochondrial defects. The proposed study will have a
significant impact on the field as it will provide new mechanistic information about how misaggregated proteins
accumulate in AD and are associated with altered ER signaling. Moreover, targeting specific intracellular
organelles may reveal effective new treatment strategies for AD."
10066098,"Project Background: Harassment is a recognized problem in VA facilities. Recent national studies of women
Veterans receiving Veterans Health Administration (VHA) health services found that 25% reported experiencing
harassment at the VA in the past year. Most often, these incidents involved sexual harassment (e.g., catcalls,
being stared at/watched, or sexual/derogatory comments) or sexist harassment (e.g., someone questioning
their identity as a Veteran or their right to care). Women Veterans who experience harassment are significantly
more likely to feel unsafe and unwelcome at the VA; and to delay or underutilize care, which may place them at
risk for poorer health outcomes.
Significance/Impact: Harassment has the potential to negatively impact the dignity, privacy, sense of
security, safety, and health of women Veterans. Recognizing this, VA has launched several initiatives:
Women’s Health Services’ “End Harassment” campaign and, most recently, VHA Executive in Charge, Dr.
Stone’s “Stand Up to Harassment Now!” campaign. However, to date, there are no evidence-based
interventions to address harassment of service users in healthcare setting such as the VA. The current study
attempts to expand the VA’s efforts to address harassment by developing and evaluating a bystander
activation intervention that can be used to increase awareness of gender-based harassment (GBH) and
confidence in and willingness to help/intervene among a range of individuals within the system (e.g. Veterans,
VA staff and leadership). By addressing harassment and the discomfort it creates, this intervention may
reduce disparities in access to and the quality of care of women Veterans.
Innovation: The lack of evidence-based interventions to address harassment in healthcare settings
represents a significant gap in VHA’s ability to provide high-quality, gender-sensitive, comprehensive health
care to women Veterans. The project attempts to address this gap by actively partnering and collaborating with
Veterans and other stakeholders to develop and evaluate a novel, Veteran-informed bystander harassment
intervention that, if effective, has the potential to make VA settings more comfortable, safe and welcoming for
women Veterans.
Specific Aims: The specific aims of this study are 1) to develop a Veteran-informed harassment bystander
activation intervention. 2) to conduct a pilot trial to examine the feasibility, acceptability, potential efficacy, and
information regarding implementation of the intervention with Veterans and VA staff.
Methodology: We will create a bystander activation harassment intervention using participatory action
research (PAR) methods. First, 20 women who have experienced harassment and are receiving services at
the VAMHCS will develop photonarratives using Photovoice PAR methods that convey experiences of
harassment at VA and its impacts. We will also conduct focus groups with male Veterans, female Veterans,
and VA staff to inform the adaptation of existing bystander behavior materials for use in a VA setting. The
intervention will be developed using these materials and refined over several meetings with Veterans and VA
staff/leadership input. Once developed, we will conduct a pilot trial of the intervention with Veterans receiving
VAMHCS services (n=35) and VA staff (n=15). All participants will complete a baseline assessment, a
qualitative interview at immediate post-intervention, and a 2-week post-intervention assessment. Feasibility
and acceptability will be assessed via rates of recruitment, retention, participant reported acceptability.
Outcomes that will be explored include awareness of harassment; recognition of the need to intervene; and
responsibility for, knowledge regarding how, and intent to intervene; and input on implementation collected.
Implementation/Next Steps: Next steps will include using the results of this study to inform a larger
randomized trial to examine the efficacy of the harassment bystander activation intervention."
10875696,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alzheimer disease (AD) and related tauopathies are major diagnostic, therapeutic, and clinical
challenges. Our previous work suggest that different tauopathies are based on unique tau aggregate
conformations, or “strains,” and that strain identity predicts specific disease progression patterns in
animal models. We hypothesize that distinct, self-propagating tau strains can move between cells of
the brain to propagate pathology in humans. Recent publications from our group indicate that tau
monomer in fact encodes strains. However this has not been rigorously tested across tauopathies.
We will test this idea first by determining whether tau monomer encodes the same sets of strains
encoded by larger assemblies in human brain (Aim 1). Next we will use multiplex biosensors to
classify monomer from human tauopathies, and determine whether monomer can classify individuals
in correlation with neuropathology with the same fidelity as larger assemblies. We will also test the
fidelity of strain propagation in human neurons vs. HEK293 cells in comparison those strains isolated
directly from human brain (Aim 2). Finally, we use structural biology approaches to determine the
conformations of seed-competent monomer. In particular, we will determine whether local structures
in tau predict its subsequent assembly into fibrils. This will be based on crosslinking mass
spectrometry, molecular modeling, cryoEM, and microcrystallography. We predict that tau monomer
will encode strain composition across tauopathies. If we are successful, we anticipate ultimately that it
will be possible to classify tauopathies based on the conformation with tau monomer. This could have
important implications for accurate diagnosis and personalized therapy."
10813743,"Despite the knowledge that pregnancy affects the health trajectory of both mother and child across the lifecourse,
significant racial disparities exist. African-American (AA) women are at greatest risk for preterm birth and for
dying from hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) than any other group in the U.S. To decipher what drives
these disparities, we are proposing a new Environmental Health Disparities Maternal and Infant
Environmental Health Riskscape (MIEHR) Research Center. The Goal of the MIEHR Research Center is to
elucidate contributions of the biological, physical, social and built environments of the environmental riskscape
to environmental health disparities in pregnant women and their infants. The Houston-based MIEHR leverages
partnerships and strong institutional support from Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Southern University,
the fourth largest historically black university in the U.S. Notably, Houston offers a microcosm for research at
the intersection of environmental exposures and health disparities, with its diverse multi-ethnic and multi-racial
population and documented environmental injustices. The city has the largest petrochemical complex in the
U.S., numerous hazardous waste sites, no zoning and is at risk for natural and industrial disasters. The MIEHR
Research Center has two synergistic Research Projects that build on a unique ongoing, perinatal database and
biospecimen repository: the BCM Peribank. Project 1: The Environmental Riskscape, Disasters and
Obstetric Outcomes will utilize an epidemiologic approach to identify differences in race-specific associations
between the mixture of individual chemicals (i.e. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and metals) and place-based
stressors in the riskscape and preterm birth. This project will also examine the impact of Hurricane Harvey on
racial disparities in these exposures. Project 2: Disparities Aware Classifiers for Maternal and Infant Health
will use an “omics” approach to develop and validate disparity aware classifiers for preterm birth and HDP for
AA and non-Hispanic White women. The classifiers will be built from data obtained at delivery and the predictive
capability of these classifiers will then be tested in second trimester pregnant women. MIEHR activities will be
informed by a Community Engagement and Dissemination Core, which will enhance environmental health
literacy and capacity for sustainable initiatives that build community resilience. An Investigator Development
Core will support innovative pilot research that will promote career development of talented investigators from
health disparity populations and increase capacity for future environmental health disparities research. The
Administrative Core will provide organizational and integration support for MIEHR investigators, institutions
and engaged communities. The MIEHR Research Center will accomplish its goals in research, career
development and community engagement with multidisciplinary and diverse teams of community and academic
experts, interdisciplinary collaborations between synergistic research projects, activities that develop a diverse
workforce and community engagement that fosters equitable community stakeholder interactions."
10808154,"SUMMARY: OVERALL - Center for Native Environmental Health Research Equity
Nearly half of the Native American population of the United States lives in 13 western states in proximity of an
estimated 161,000 abandoned hardrock mines, with more than 4,000 being abandoned uranium mines.
Because of their reliance on natural resources to maintain traditional diets, lifestyles, customs and languages,
these tribal communities have direct and frequent contact with metal mixtures from abandoned mine sites,
creating exposures through multiple pathways including inhalation, drinking water, and ingestion of foods either
directly or indirectly contaminated by migration of the wastes. Exacerbating these exposures are disparities in
infrastructure, including services like safe drinking water and solid waste management. Lack of effective solid-
waste management resulted historically in burning and open dumping of solid waste, but with the ever-
increasing amounts of plastic entering the waste stream, the low-temperature, incomplete combustion of this
process, and the environmental degradation through weathering, our tribal partners are increasingly concerned
about the emissions of toxic degradation products of plastics into their environment. The concerns over how
the combined toxicants from these processes and the metals we have already linked to immune dysfunction in
these communities have led to this Phase 2 Native EH Equity proposal. We have found metals mixtures result
in different exposure profiles across our three partnering indigenous communities: Navajo, Apsáalooke, and
Cheyenne River Sioux. And while we see commonalities in immune dysfunction across these communities
that can contribute to disparities in cancer and other chronic diseases, the metals exposures alone do not
account for all of the risk. Therefore, in this Phase 2 Center we will develop an understanding of the emerging
additional plastic degradation contaminant profiles, evaluating constituents and distribution of microplastics and
other degradation products, along with emissions from extractive industries that could add to these classes of
chemicals, in both stationary and mobile exposure assessments. We will monitor grazing patterns of livestock
and their resulting exposures through air and consumption of plants and water, as well as stationary in-home
and mobile monitoring on people during their normal activities to evaluate exposure components and pathways
contributing the greatest risk with the ultimate goal of developing mitigation strategies at individual and tribal
levels to inform decisions and policies to reduce the risks linked to increasing cancer and other chronic disease
disparities in these communities. The resulting fine-scale predictive models, ground-truthed through
monitoring, and the integration of multiple exposure streams will provide a resource to not only inform policy,
but aid clinicians in identifying early risks to develop prevention strategies as well."
10850924,"Program Summary/Abstract
The overall goal of the Western Region Universities Consortium (WRUC) training program is to
protect workers and communities from exposure to hazardous materials and hazardous waste;
to prevent, prepare for, respond to and recover from emergencies/disasters; and to create
pathways to careers in the environmental field and construction industry. WRUC programs are
delivered in EPA Regions IX and X through the UCLA Labor Occupational Safety and Health
Program (UCLA-LOSH) as the lead institution, UC Berkeley’s Labor Occupational Health
Program (UCB-LOHP), Arizona State University’s Fulton Schools of Engineering,
Environmental & Resource Management Program (ASU), and the University of Washington
School of Nursing (UW). The Consortium has developed model programs since 1987 and will
continue to do so in the coming five years through three NIEHS components: Hazardous Waste
Worker Training Program (HWWTP), Hazard Disaster Preparedness Training Program
(HDPTP) and Environmental Career Worker Training Program (ECWTP). WRUC will train
4,891 workers and community members per year in 367 courses for a total of 49,663 contact
hours. Courses address hazards to workers in hazardous waste cleanup and hazmat treatment,
storage, transport and disposal operations; promote biosafety preparedness among healthcare
workers; strengthen emergency response, disaster prevention, preparedness, response and
recovery activities; and provide job readiness and life skills. WRUC will expand outreach to
underserved populations; respond to new and emerging hazards; build capacity to sustain
training activities, safety and emergency response programs; and support a national network of
HAZWOPER trainers and emergency responders. 1) HWWTP activities will reach 2,887
hazardous materials and waste workers and supervisors throughout the region per year and
strengthen emergency response capacity among remote tribal groups in the Southwest, Pacific
Northwest and Alaska and along the U.S.-Mexico border. 2) HDPTP activities will reach 1,814
workers and residents per year through partnerships with worker centers, labor unions, and
community groups in California, schools and university campuses in Washington and California,
and tribal groups in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest. 3) ECWTP activities in Los Angeles,
Portland, and Alaska will train and place 190 workers per year in construction and
environmental jobs."
10850946,"OVERALL - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
OAI, a Chicago community-based workforce agency, proposes to administer the HWWTP and ECWTP
Consortium. HWWTP will train three front-line and underserved target populations that handle hazardous
substances and will add two initiatives: Infectious Disease Response and Ammonia Safety Awareness training.
Over 5 years HWWTP will train 20,405 students and generate 223,000 contact hours through 1,590 courses
across 19 states. ECWTP will proposes to recruit, train, and place 560 participants, generating 193,960 total
contact hours in the targeted population in Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas and Indianapolis.
Significance: Both Programs target the underserved and address public health disparities, prevention, and
protection of workers, EJ residents and their communities from exposure to hazardous substances. HWWTP
will also train emergency first responders, especially volunteers and other responders who lack resources to
access vital HazMat and related training. ECWTP responds to the underrepresentation of disadvantaged
residents in the environmental workforce and targets individuals who face multiple barriers to employment.
Leadership and Capacity: Salvatore Cali, MPH, CIH, has been PI since 2016 and has 28 years of experience
in public health, adult education, academic instruction, IH site evaluations, research, and service projects. OAI
has been a WTP grantee since 1995 and during that period, it has successfully met annual terms, conditions,
training benchmarks, and overall goals of past awards. OAI has received 5 supplementary awards that provide
testimony to its capacity. The PI is supported by experienced OAI personnel and 70 peer instructors.
Innovation: OAI applies innovative training methods and incorporates Blended Learning in a learning
management system and robust program evaluation and improvement models. ECWTP uses a dynamic
recruitment and entry screening process, well-developed Power Skills training models, and dedicated trainee
support staff to increase training and employment retention for students. HWWTP utilizes very experienced
instructors and a Train-the Trainer model to disseminate training to a wide range of national collaborators.
Approach: OAI utilizes a supportive Advisory Board and a network of partners and collaborators representing
well over 120 organizations, including funders and employers. OAI also keeps eyes and ears open to field-
related information supplied by instructors, including active first responders. These connections help OAI
maintain its connection to trends in training and employment opportunities.
Environment: OAI has created an environment conducive to collaboration among consortium members and
collaborators. The program has invested in technology, classroom and hands-on training facilities and an array
of resources. OAI will continue to work toward sustainability by building the capacity of its training partners to
self-finance much of their training and seek additional leveraging opportunities, including fee-for-service work."
10909101,"PROJECT SUMMARY OF THE OVERALL U54 CENTER
Assessing the risk of adverse natural product (NP)-drug interactions (NPDIs) is of paramount importance due to
the exponential NP sales growth in the US. This effort is challenged by relatively scant pharmacokinetic
knowledge of individual NP constituents that precipitate these interactions and a lack of mechanistic
understanding of NP effects on drug disposition. Investigations of NPDIs to address these knowledge gaps are
complicated by the inherently large variability in phytoconstituent composition of supposedly the same NP,
acquisition of sufficient high-quality NP study materials, and the diverse populations to which NPs are marketed,
including the elderly. Our established Center of Excellence for Natural Product Drug Interaction Research
(NaPDI Center) was created by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Heath (NCCIH) in 2015
to address this public health problem. A cross-disciplinary research team composed of experts in clinical
pharmacology, NP chemistry, biomedical informatics, and health communications led the charge to address the
challenges unique to NPDI research. As detailed in this renewal application, we will advance the mission of the
NaPDI Center by designing and executing new mechanistically-driven Interaction Projects, expanding the utility
of our web-based data repository and public portal, and broadening dissemination of knowledge to national and
international research communities. These activities will be accomplished through synergistic interactions
between three established scientific Cores (Pharmacology, Analytical, and Informatics) and an overarching
Administrative Core. The Pharmacology Core will expand an innovative method to select three to five high priority
NPs to study as precipitants of potential clinically significant NPDIs. The Analytical Core will source and fully
characterize the chemical composition of commercially available, representative NPs and provide NP study
materials free of adulterants and contaminants for the Interaction Projects. The Pharmacology Core will design
and execute rigorous in vitro studies to establish the mechanism of NP effects on drug disposition; predict the
magnitude of NPDIs using physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation; and design and
conduct clinical NPDI studies. The Analytical Core will provide quantitative analysis of object drugs, NP
constituents, and emerging drug disposition biomarkers in the human pharmacokinetic samples. The interpreted
data generated from the Interaction Projects will be transferred to the data repository developed and maintained
by the Informatics Core. Major findings will be disseminated to scientific and other interested communities
through our unique public access web portal perpetuated by the Informatics Core. All Cores will share the task
of broadening Center outreach activities through targeted workshops and symposia at national and international
scientific meetings. A Steering Committee composed of Core leaders and NCCIH officials will jointly oversee
Center scientific progress with an External Advisory Panel of experts in relevant fields selected by NCCIH."

introduced at a rapid pace. Although maternal use of ARVs has successfully reduced perinatal HIV
transmission, there remains a clear need to monitor the safety of in utero ARV for infant and child health.
Currently, 1.7 million children under the age of 15 are living with HIV globally – the vast majority with perinatally
acquired HIV infection (PHIV) - who are aging into young adulthood. In the US, the Centers for Disease Control

11082539,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pain is a multidimensional experience with sensory and affective components. The aversive quality of pain, i.e.
its inherent unpleasantness, causes a majority of chronic pain patients’ suffering and often leads to comorbid
disorders such as anxiety and depression. Despite their addictive qualities, opioid analgesics remain clinically
useful since they can profoundly dampen pain affect. Thus, discovering targets that could alter neural activity
selectively in neural circuits that generate pain aversion, but not in the reward or breathing circuits that opioids
also alter, is an attractive strategy to develop novel, safer analgesics.
 Recently, by combining in vivo imaging and chemogenetic manipulations of neural dynamics in the basal
and lateral amygdala (BLA) of freely behaving mice encountering noxious stimuli, our collaboration discovered
a distinct neural ensemble in the BLA that encodes the negative affective valence of pain (Corder et al., Science,
2019). Chemogenetic inhibition of this nociceptive coding ensemble using Gi/o-protein-coupled-DREADDs
alleviated pain affective behaviors without altering withdrawal reflexes, anxiety or reward. Moreover, our
functional studies of this nociceptive ensemble revealed its causal role in the phenomenon of allodynia.
 Based on these exciting findings, we now seek to identify novel targets to treat pain by determining the
molecular identity of these BLA nociceptive cells via in situ hybridization and single cell RNA-sequencing
(scRNA-seq). Our preliminary scRNA-seq studies of BLA nociceptive cells suggest they express dozens of Gi/o
protein-coupled receptors (Gi/o-GPCRs) that could be targeted for anti-nociception against pain affect. Further,
our tracing studies have revealed a set of layer V pyramidal cells in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) that project
onto BLA nociceptive neurons, consistent with the fact cingulotomy can be used to treat intractable chronic pain.
Resolving the molecular identity of these ACC nociceptive cells could also reveal new targets to treat pain affect.
 Thus, here we propose to catalog candidate Gi/o-GPCR targets in BLA and ACC (Aim 1, Discovery), test
their utility to treat pain (Aim 2, Validation), and verify these new targets have no effect in the brain’s reward and
breathing circuitry (Aim 3, Safety & Translatability). In Aim 1 we will identify Gi/o-GPCR targets in pain affect
circuits of the BLA and ACC using mouse genetics, viral tracers, scRNA-seq and bioinformatics analyses. In
Aim 2, we will validate the neurophysiological effects and analgesic properties of these new targets, using
electrophysiological recordings in live brain tissue slices, animal models of acute and chronic pain, and Ca2+
imaging studies in behaving mice of BLA and ACC neural activity. In Aim 3, we will verify the safety and
translatability of the novel antinociceptive drug targets. We will evaluate each target for abuse potential and
effects on breathing by using behavioral assays for reward processing and whole-body plethysmography,
respectively. To evaluate whether our results in rodents are likely to translate clinically, we will also analyze
expression patterns of the drug targets in human tissue using in situ hybridization."

The overall goal of the University of Iowa Wellstone Muscular Dystrophy Specialized Research Center
(MDSRC) is to perform research on the various muscular dystrophies that arise from abnormal processing of
the dystroglycan protein (dystroglycanopathies). The Center will achieve this overall goal by conducting basic
and translational research in dystroglycanopathy patients, patient-derived biosamples, and mouse models. Our
MDSRC application is composed of two projects and three cores, all of which are directed by investigators with
a proven track record of excellence and collaboration in basic, translational and clinical research. Project 1
(Campbell) will investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underly dystroglycanopathies by
evaluating the relationship between α-dystroglycan (α-DG) matriglycan length and its laminin-binding
properties in control and dystroglycanopathy patient fibroblasts and muscle biopsies. Additional studies will
define the requirements for matriglycan synthesis as regulated by protein-protein and protein-sugar
interactions. A dystroglycanopathy mouse model will be utilized to identify novel pathophysiologic mechanisms
and determine the structure and laminin binding properties required to improve muscle function. Project 2
(Mathews) will refine the natural history of FKRP-related dystroglycanopathy derived from an established,
unique cohort of patients by expanding the number of clinical sites evaluating patients and by extending the
natural history study to patients with more advanced clinical severity. Extended follow up of non-FKRP
genotypes will identify cohorts that share similar rates of motor progression who might be studied together in
gene non-specific clinical trials. Candidate proteomic biomarkers in blood or urine for the full spectrum of
dystroglycanopathy genotypes will be validated and related to disease status. Core A (Campbell and Moore) is
an administrative core that will coordinate the activities within and outside the Center, as a means to promote
an interactive and collaborative research environment, and to engage patients in muscular dystrophy research.
Core B (Moore), a Muscle-Tissue/Cell-Culture/Diagnostics Core, will support Projects 1 and 2, serve as a
national tissue and cell-culture resource for research, provide specialized diagnostic testing for a wide range of
muscular dystrophies, and maintain the infrastructure needed to evaluate muscle biopsies in support of clinical
trials. Finally, Core C (Mathews and Campbell) will coordinate our Training initiatives. Among the support this
Core provides will be fellowships enabling two medical students per year to perform research in the Center and
to participate in the care of patients alongside Dr. Mathews, with basic science training opportunities also
provided to a postdoctoral fellow and an undergraduate research fellow. The highly integrated cores and
projects of this Center will accelerate the tempo of discovery in preclinical translational research, and also
establish the clinical-trial readiness of a cohort of dystroglycanopathy patients."
10875763,"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affects 5.5 million Americans and recent studies suggest that AD pathogenesis
can be affected by the gut microbiota. We submit an extensively revised proposal in which we have identified
three major mechanisms by which gut microbes may regulate AD: (i) APP processing and tau phosphorylation,
(ii) modulating microglia, and (iii) activating peripheral immunity. We found that Bacteroides was linked to high
levels of Aβ and Allobaculum was linked to low levels of Aβ, and we also identified metagenomic functions
associated with Aβ. To find novel microbial mediators we will perform metabolomics. Administering Allobaculum
reverses age-related changes in inflammatory expression in the cortex of WT mice and reversed markers of the
microglia neurodegenerative disease phenotype (MGnD). In new preliminary data, we found that administering
Bacteroides fragilis increased Aβ plaques and depleting Bacteroidetes with metronidazole decreased Aβ
plaques. Both manipulations altered APP processing gene expression, including APP phosphorylation,
trafficking from the golgi, and degradation by insulin degrading enzyme, which is a new potential microbially-
driven mechanism that we will investigate in Aim 1. Of note, Bacteroides is increased in aging and AD in humans.
 Both microglia and peripheral monocytes play an important role in AD. In new preliminary data, we now
show that colonizing mice with microbiota from AD patients increases Trem2 expression on microglia, which is
a regulator of the MGnD phenotype, and that it decreases the expression of CCR2 on peripheral monocytes.
CCR2+ monocytes traffic to the brain and are critical for the clearance of Aβ. Thus, we provide evidence that the
AD microbiota can contribute to dysfunction in immune signaling pathways known to impact AD. We also show
that administering specific bacteria or antibiotics modulates peripheral and central innate immunity.
 AIM 1: Which microbial factors alter AD pathogenesis in Aβ and tau animal models? We will
determine whether (i) specific bacteria, (ii) individual antibiotics, and (iii) microbiota from AD subjects affect Aβ
and tau pathology and cognitive decline. We will investigate whether this is linked with altered APP processing,
regulation of Aβ degradation enzymes, activation of pro-amyloidogenic pathways, or with altering Tau
phosphorylation. We will use 16S rRNA and shotgun metagenomic sequencing to identify bacteria and functions
linked with AD pathology, and identify metabolites altered in models of AD.
 AIM 2: How does the microbiota modulate innate immunity in Aβ and tau animal models? We will
investigate how microbiota interventions alter microglial migration and Aβ phagocytosis, and whether the
microbiota modulate the switch between homeostatic and neurodegenerative microglia. We will test whether the
microbiota alter monocyte migration to the brain and subsequent Aβ phagocytosis. We will establish whether
microbial cell wall components, live microbes, and/or their secreted metabolites drive changes in innate immunity
that affect AD."

The Charleston Alcohol Research Center (ARC) continues to focus on treatment and treatment implications as
an overarching theme. The ARC maintains its long-standing tradition of embracing multidisciplinary and
translational research approaches, integrating both basic research and clinical investigations all centered on this
common theme. The ARC also continues its tradition of teaming junior faculty with more experienced
investigators, capitalizing on new talent and bringing sophisticated cutting-edge technologies and research
approaches that enhance research efforts in addressing the Center’s overall scientific goals.
The ARC is comprised of five research projects and three cores. The Administrative Core provides the leadership
and infrastructure to facilitate the overall scientific and educational mission of the Center as a whole. The Shared
Resource Core provides vital scientific services needed by Center researchers to facilitate integration, maximize
resources, and increase productivity. The Pilot Core attracts new investigators and new ideas to the Center,
thereby broadening and augmenting its research and training activities.
In this renewal application, proposed preclinical and clinical research projects all center on a common research
focus – neuroadaptations in cortical processes that underlie transition to excessive drinking. Three basic
research projects will use sophisticated circuitry mapping, cellular/molecular biology techniques, and behavioral
procedures to examine how chronic alcohol exposure alters functional activity of cortical sub-regions and their
projections, and how such adaptations in cortical-subcortical neurocircuitry mediate excessive drinking, which
may be characterized as inflexible, compulsive/habit-like drinking. Two clinical research projects will employ
sophisticated neuroimaging techniques to focus on similar cortical areas and projections in evaluating the ability
of different treatment modalities (pharmacological and non-pharmacological) to alter the circuitry and reduce
alcohol cue-induced brain activation, craving, and drinking.
The Charleston ARC is poised to continue its national leadership role and demonstrated success in: (a) fostering
multidisciplinary and translational state-of-the-art research efforts that are thematically-focused on the topic of
treatment and treatment implications; (b) attracting new (especially early-stage) investigators into the Center,
thereby invigorating its research efforts; and (c) providing a stimulating environment that enriches training
opportunities and professional development for the next generation of researchers in the alcohol field."

The Steelworkers Charitable and Educational Organization (SCEO), the non-profit (501c3) arm
of the United Steelworkers (USW), is applying for HWWTP and HDPTP funds to support a
vibrant training partnership linking two of the largest U.S.-based industrial unions with rapidly
expanding immigrant worker centers and Tribal communities. The SCEO’s training entity, the
Tony Mazzocchi Center (TMC), brings together the USW, the Communications Workers of
America (CWA), the Labor Institute (LI), the National Day Labor Organizing Network
(NDLON), Make the Road New York (MRNY) and the Umatilla, Cayuse, Walla Walla, Yakama,
and Nez Perce Tribes.
Through the HWWTP five-year program, we will conduct 2,265 courses to reach 50,075
workers, managers, community residents and Tribal members with 545,200
hours of training to help prevent toxic releases, fires, explosions, injuries, sickness and death.
A primary focus is on training and mentoring union, immigrant and Tribal H&S advocates to
promote concrete and lasting prevention at their worksites and on their Tribal lands. The
HDPTP program will expand our multi-lingual team of Specialized Emergency Response
Trainers (SERTs) from 9 to 15 members. SERTs are prepared to go anywhere at any time to
provide pre- and post-incident training for high-hazard workers and community responders.
Also, we will develop 25 Disaster Response Hubs at high-hazard sites, in worker centers and on
Tribal lands to serve as locations for pre- and post-incident training and related activities.
SERTS will also serve on our Opioids working group to provide training in response to this
major health crisis. Our HDPTP program will offer 190 classes that will provide 3,475 at-
risk workers with 35,600 hours of training.
Target Populations: The TMC has access to over 6,000 workplaces and worker centers
including the USW (600,000 members), the CWA (600,000 members), NDLON (55 worker
centers) and MRNY (23,000 members at 5 centers). TMC Tribal partners include Umatilla,
Cayuse, and Walla Walla (3,000 members); the Yakama (31,000); and the Nez Perce (18,800).
Our training populations are employed in metal mining, refining, milling and manufacturing;
telecommunications; transportation; oil refining, pulp and paper mills and manufacturing;
chemical manufacturing and synthesis; nuclear energy; rubber and plastics; pharmaceuticals;
automobile parts; electrical, appliance and other manufacturing; cement; construction;
shipbuilding; health care, and education. Immigrant day-laborers and temporary workers are
employed in clean-up activities, especially during emergencies; construction; cleaning; home
care; warehousing; and distribution. Tribal workers engage in emergency services including fire,
police, and medical services as well as in the construction trades. Approximately 850,000 of
these workers are potentially exposed to hazardous substances covered by OSHA Standard 29
CFR 1910, EPA 40 CFR 311, and DOT 49 CFR 171-177."
10768946,"ABSTRACT
Chronic pain is the most prominent symptom of osteoarthritis (OA) and a key reason why patients seek medical
help. Persistent pain at rest profoundly affects the quality of life and daily physical activity. Pain itself is a risk
factor for the development of future functional decline and increasing pain is a predictor of physical functional
limitation and disability. Osteoarthritic pain is thought to emanate from small myelinated or unmyelinated fibers
in one or more tissues including synovium, ligament, subchondral bone, and meniscus. In clinic, subchondral
bone marrow edema-like lesions (BMLs) visualized by MRI are highly correlated with OA pain. Thus, the
observation suggests that the source of pain is likely from subchondral bone. The detailed mechanism how
subchondral bone generates OA pain, however, is largely unknown. During OA progression, aberrant osteoclast
(OC) bone resorption enlarges subchondral bone cavity, which promotes sensory innervation and leads to OA
pain. PGE2 mediates sensory nerve regulation of bone density. PGE2 concentration in bone negatively
correlated with bone density. Our pilot data showed PGE2 levels and sensory innervation significantly increased
in the cavity of OA subchondral bone which resembles extreme low bone density as seen in osteoporosis. This
prompted us to propose that high levels of PGE2 sensitize the highly specialized sensory neurons, nociceptors,
in the subchondral bone to promote pain. During the pathogenesis of OA, senescent cells are increased in the
subchondral bone with at least 40% being osteoclastic cells. We have recently shown that OC secrete Netrin-1,
an axonal guidance molecule, to induce sensory nerve axon growth in the subchondral bone to mediate OA pain.
Therefore, we hypothesize that enlarged subchondral bone cavity by senescent OCs elevates PGE2 levels and
further enhances sensory innervation to mediate OA pain. To test the hypothesis, we will investigate the role of
senescent OC in inducing subchondral bone cavity and sensory innervation. We will examine the role of
subchondral bone cavity by senescent OC induced abnormal bone remodeling in the elevation of PGE2 and
subsequent OA pain. We will then test the effect of eliminating senescent osteoclast on subchondral bone cavity
and sensory innervation for OA pain by administration of senolytic drug ABT263 to OA mice. Finally, we will
investigate the effect of rescuing subchondral bone remodeling on sensory innervation and OA pain. We have
developed a novel conjugate that bone-specifically delivers a TGFβ inhibitor and OC inhibitor alendronate. The
effect of this small molecule conjugate will be examined on sensory innervation in subchondral bone and OA
pain."
10911059,"Project Summary/Abstract for the Overall Component
The techniques of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genomic editing and the ability to generate induced pluripotent stem
cells (iPSCs) from a sample of a patient’s blood have placed medicine on the brink of a revolution in our ability
to treat, and perhaps even cure, a broad range of genome-based diseases. The overall goal of the UT
Southwestern Wellstone Muscular Dystrophy Specialized Research Center is to improve the treatment provided
to Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients by developing a new therapeutic strategy called “myoediting”.
The Center has been built around five integral components. These include: two inter-related research projects
(1) one that will work to optimize the tools for application of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated DMD exon skipping to
permanently restore dystrophin function, and the other (2) that will identify genetic and biomarker associations
with cardiac phenotypes in patients with dystrophinopathies [i.e. DMD and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD)]
and serve as a primary source for human iPSCs. These projects will be complemented and supported by three
Cores (A) an Administrative Core, that will also direct patient outreach and education, (B) a Myoediting Scientific
Research Resource Core, which will generate DMD/BMD iPSCs from DMD/BMD patients and differentiate them
into iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes as well as house the DMD/BMD Biobank, which will store relevant clinical
data as well as validated guide RNAs for each genetic mutation, and (C) a Training Core, which will enhance the
educational environment in order to recruit, train, and maintain the next generation of transformative investigators
focused on addressing the challenges of muscular dystrophy. We firmly believe myoediting will offer an
innovative therapeutic modality for the treatment of many thousands of DMD patients and offer a long awaited
hope to these patients and their families devastated by DMD."
10875782,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of extracellular neuritic plaques and
intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles. In addition to amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, the
presence of dystrophic neurites (DNs), referring to aberrant neuritic sprouting as well as swollen
dendrites and/or axons, is known as one pathological feature in surrounding amyloid plaques on AD
postmortem brains, and has been shown to correlate with cognitive dysfunctions in AD. With the
increasing number of failures in clinical trials that target the formation of amyloid deposition, AD
treatment is recognized to be extremely challenging. This study aims to explore the approach for
preventing or reducing DNs. We have previously demonstrated that reticulon proteins, mainly RTN3 but
not RTN1, are massively accumulated in DNs in surrounding neuritic but not diffuse amyloid plaques.
RTN3+ DNs contain mainly clustered tubular endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To build around this finding,
we have recently discovered through our various morphological characterizations that ATG9A‐positive
DNs (ATG9A+ DNs) form near the core plaques while RTN3+ DNs form subsequently and can surround
ATG9A+ DNs. ATG9A is a critical molecule required not only for pre‐autophagosome formation but also
for autophagosome elongation and maturation. DNs, enriched with multibody vesicles and marked by
the autophagy protein LC3 and RAB7 or ubiquitin, are usually distributed relatively farthest from the
core amyloid plaque and develop the latest in our temporal study. In light of growing knowledge in this
area, we propose to advance our study further by testing the hypothesis in this renewal application that
aging and amyloid deposition induces ATG9A‐mediated abnormal trafficking and subsequent tubular ER
clustering and autophagic dysfunctions in AD brains. Two specific aims are proposed to test this
hypothesis: 1) Aim 1 is to investigate the effects of amyloid pathology on ATG9A trafficking and the
underlying mechanism; 2) Aim 2 is to determine the role of microglia in mediating growth of dystrophic
neurites in surrounding amyloid plaques. Overall, this renewal proposal has a set of readily achievable
experiments that focus on the growth of various form of DNs and functional relationship between
reticulon proteins and ATG9A in AD pathogenesis. We will also explore molecular targets for reducing or
preventing formation of DNs for the ultimate purpose of improving cognitive functions. Such a study will
yield critical knowledge that may guide therapeutic applications for decreasing DN formation and
cognitive dysfunction in AD patients."
10609967,"Project Summary
The nucleotide repeat expansion (NRE) mutation on chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) has been
identified as the most common genetic mutation link to frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS). It has become clear that these two diseases exist in a spectrum of neurological and
neuromuscular disorders based on overlapping pathological features identified in patients post-mortem tissue,
yet the mechanistic cause for neuropathogenesis is unclear. Age-dependent hyper- and/or hypo-excitability has
been a well-described feature of ALS and is now being reported in FTD/ALS patients and patient-derived induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that carry the C9orf72 NRE mutation. Moreover, aberrant neuronal activity
increases with age and can contribute to accelerated aging in animal models. Although the neurospecific
contribution for loss-of-function of the C9orf72 protein is not well described, two C9orf72 NRE gain-of-function
mechanisms, RNA toxicity from the bidirectional transcription of the NRE and/or dipeptide repeat (DPR) toxicity
from the non-AUG-dependent translation of the NRE, have been shown to contribute to neurotoxic mechanisms.
We recently identified a potential link between aberrant neuronal activity and increased DPR toxicity, where
increased excitotoxic stress or repetitive neuronal activation can drive DPR production. However, further
investigation is crucial to understand these in vitro observations and to determine if these may contribute to
C9orf72 NRE-linked disease pathogenesis in vivo. Therefore, in this research proposal we hypothesize that
abnormal activity increase neurophysiological stress that can modify C9orf72 NRE-linked neuropathogenesis
and thereby increase the pathological burden in C9orf72 NRE bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) disease
models, which currently lack overt or robust FTD or ALS phenotypes. Additionally, we postulate that aberrant
activity will alter the spatiotemporal gain-of-function toxicity. To test these hypotheses, we will utilize a battery of
biochemical to cellular longitudinal assays while utilizing C9orf72 NRE human iPSC and in vivo models to test
the causal relationship among aberrant neuronal activity and spatiotemporal dynamics of C9orf72 NRE derived
RNA and DPRs using novel patient derived neuronal models and then validate these finds in vivo. Ultimately,
we anticipate that this work will establish a crucial foundation for understanding the spatiotemporal causal
relationship between neurophysiological stress caused by aberrant neuronal activity and C9-RNE-linked
pathogenesis in vitro and in vivo, as well as reveal new therapeutic intervention opportunities to treat
neurogenerative disorders linked to the C9-NRE mutation."
10875725,"ABSTRACT
Metabolites reflect the dynamic, qualitative and quantitative changes in humans and provide a functional
assessment of the physiological state of individuals with and without disease. The metabolome represents the
closest link between the phenotype and the underlying biochemical layers of the genome. In the human body,
metabolites are chemically transformed during metabolism in response to genetic and environmental factors in
the causal pathway to a disease or to an in vivo change as a result of the disease. The human metabolome has
been studied in Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a small number of cross-sectional and longitudinal investigations
with limited numbers of ethnic groups and little or no concurrent genetic analyses. The Washington Heights,
Inwood Columbia Aging Project is a multi-ethnic cohort that has collected clinical data and biological resources
for several years with the goal of identifying the environmental and genetic risk factors and causes of AD. The
cohort is ideally suited for this project because 23% are non-Hispanic whites, 29% are African Americans and
48% are Caribbean Hispanics, and because loss-to-follow up has been minimal due to the use of a validated
telephone interview of the participants and informants. We have conducted medical and neurological
examinations, cognitive assessments and captured environmental/lifestyle risk and protective factors in this
longitudinal investigation at 18-month intervals. We have also conducted genome wide association studies,
whole exome and genome sequencing and have stored DNA and plasma over multiple time points. We now
propose to identify those metabolites that are associated with the development of AD and that reflect changes
in disease severity over time and how they interact with environmental factors. The strength of our study lies in
its ability to investigate changes in the metabolome among a group of individuals from different ethnic and racial
backgrounds that have been genetically characterized. Blood is readily available as a means for repeated
measures augmenting the precision of individualized analyses particularly when completed in a genetically
characterized multi-ethnic cohort. We propose a genetically driven, metabolomics profile analyses from plasma
to investigate endogenous metabolites related to AD and exogenous metabolites related to
environmental/lifestyle exposures associated with AD. The planned study will provide a major opportunity to add
deeper phenotyping using metabolomics to a genetically characterized, multi-ethnic cohort residing in an urban
community, which in turn, should clarify the underlying mechanisms linking to genetic and environmental
pathways leading to AD."

This project will examine the protective effects and mechanisms of dietary taurine
supplementation in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We will measure
taurine uptake into the brain and taurine synthesis rates using labeled taurine and
magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Then, we will determine how much
protection taurine dietary supplementation (at various doses) provides against
progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) symptoms in an AD mouse model. The
protection will be measured using a battery of in vivo imaging markers (MRI, MRS,
positron emission tomography (PET), behavioral tests and post mortem markers of
neuroinflammation, AD pathology and neurochemistry (MRS) taken from the same
mice. Then, the same post mortem measurements will be made in human brain
tissue from a brain bank with very well characterized specimens including healthy
controls, mild cognitive impairment and pathologically confirmed Alzheimer’s
disease. The end result of the project should be a better understanding of the role of
taurine in the brain and good test of a novel therapeutic that can also be detected in
live human brain (a “theranostic”). This compound should be readily translatable to
human populations due to its widespread use among athletes as a dietary
supplement."

The continuation of the Alcohol Research Group's (ARG) National Alcohol Research Center, Epidemiology of
Alcohol Problems: Alcohol-related Disparities, brings increased focus to the NIH's priority area of disparities

methodological contributions for over 40 years, studies the complex interactions between drinking patterns
across the life-course, demographic characteristics, sociocultural and drinking contexts, community and policy
factors, and problem outcomes, both in the general population and with attention to high-risk subgroups.
Recognizing the importance of disparities in alcohol use patterns, problems and health outcomes, and the
significant gaps in the knowledge base in this area despite our past contributions, we continue to focus on
disparities in the 2021-25 Center, organized around four research projects: the National Alcohol Surveys

national epidemiological survey with large oversamples of Blacks and Latinos and individually-linked geo-
referenced area measures, conducted with comparable measurement every 5 years and facilitating disparities
analyses focused on race/ethnicity and socioeconomic groups; the Health Disparities Project 2 addressing
racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in alcohol-related injuries, diabetes and heart-related outcomes; the
Alcohol Services Project 3 on the quality of and disparities in alcohol-related care received and how this may
be changing with health reform; and the High-Intensity Drinking (HID) Project 4 involving trends in HID,
analyses of the characteristics of events where 8+/12+ drinks are consumed, characterization and classification
of the individuals that drink at these levels and the problems they experience. Supporting these projects are the
Administrative Core, facilitating Center integration, synergy and success, training, dissemination and

10911089,"Overall - Interaction of external inputs with internal dynamics:
 influence of brain states on neural computation and behavior
 Project Summary
A central challenge in neuroscience involves understanding how assemblies of cortical neurons, comprised of
different cell types and inhabiting different layers, work together to generate coherent dynamical internal states,
that then interact with external sensory inputs to generate state-dependent behaviors on a moment-by-moment
basis. Key impediments to meeting this foundational challenge include lack of adequate technological and
computational tools to monitor, control, identify and model neural state dynamics emerging from cortical cell
assemblies spanning multiple cortical cell-types and layers. We propose to develop an unprecedented confluence
of technology and computation to achieve such capabilities by building on our team’s significant prior work. In
particular, our combined technology and computation platform will enable us to: (1) perform volumetric imaging
of thousands of cortical cells during behavior to collect both relevant spatiotemporal activity patterns and 3D
positioning; (2) simultaneously write arbitrary spatiotemporal patterns into tens to hundreds of individually
identified cells at millisecond temporal resolution using 2-photon multiSLM methods; and (3) using hydrogel
tissue-chemistry and single-cell sequencing methods, obtain deep molecular cell-type information in the same
neurons that were both measured and controlled during behavior. This unprecedented simultaneous
read/write/cell-typing technology will be tightly integrated with computational methods that can: (1) employ
state of the art systems identification methods to identify and extract neural states and the dynamical laws
governing their interactions with external inputs; and (2) amongst the astronomical number of possible
spatiotemporal stimulation patterns, predict interesting ones that can best refine models, yield conceptual
insights, and yield the capacity for optimal control of cortical circuit dynamics, with potential clinical relevance.
This combined technology and computation will empower next-generation experiments that allow us to learn
the dynamical language (in terms of state space dynamics) of cortical circuits, play back modified versions of this
language for both insight and control, and understand how this language emerges from the concerted activity of
multiple cell-types across layers. Our technology/computation platform will be validated in multiple experiments
across species and brain regions, guided by deep and long-standing theories of internal state dynamics in
computational neuroscience. Throughout, new methods will be collaboratively validated in the diverse
preparations of our experimental labs (such cross-cutting interactions are shown in blue text). In particular we
will focus on testing theories underlying several foundational classes of neural computation: (1) ability of sensory
networks to generate accurate percepts by detecting and amplifying weak sensory inputs amidst spontaneous
background activity; (2) Bayesian integration of multisensory inputs to convert sensorimotor experiences into
internal estimates of external state variables and their uncertainty; and (3) triggering and maintenance of
discrete internal attractor states capable of controlling stable behavior."

mucosal surfaces lining the alimentary tract: this is the Center’s Theme. We address the fundamental
mechanisms that underlie normal digestive tract function and the pathogenesis of digestive diseases.
Center members work in 4 major Research Areas that address the basis for most diseases of the
alimentary tract: n Cell, Developmental, and Stem Cell Biology of the Alimentary Tract; n Innate and
Adaptive Mucosal Immunology and Microbial Pathogenesis; n Gut Microbiology and Metabolism; and n
Clinical and Translational Human Studies.
The Center also includes 55 Affiliate Members (not included in Research Base), who participate in
Center activities, use our Cores, but who conduct research that falls outside the theme of the HDDC.
Our Members’ resources are amplified through services, equipment and training in 3 Biomedical Cores
that provide: (Core B) high-resolution microscopy & histopathology, (Core C) diverse technologies to
study epithelial cell function & mucosal immunology, and (Core D) technologies in gnotobiotic mice,
microbiological and metabolic analyses. Our Cores helped produce 424 original papers. The HDDC
Clinical Component supports clinical and translational GI research through subsidized biostatistical and
bio-repository services. The Center fosters scientific collaborations through an Enrichment Program
reflecting our theme, including an annual symposium, a biennial regional conference ""Frontiers in

Alcohol abuse is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and recent data indicate that alcoholic
liver disease affects over 10 million Americans. In addition to the classically appreciated impact of alcohol use
on the liver, injury to other organs, such as the intestine, skeletal muscle, kidney, adipose tissue and the neural
system contribute to morbidity and mortality associated with chronic alcohol abuse. Understanding both the
common and tissue-specific mechanisms by which ethanol impairs cellular and organ function will lead to the
development of rationally designed therapeutic interventions to both prevent and reverse tissue damage and
disease resulting from chronic alcohol consumption. The overall goal of the Northern Ohio Alcohol Center
(NOAC) is to identify specific molecular targets of ethanol-induced damage, as well as understand the complex
adaptive and maladaptive responses of cells and systems to damage. This information will enable us to 1) target
therapeutic interventions that will either slow and/or reverse the progression of alcohol-induced organ injury and
2) develop biomarkers that reflect injury and will be useful in the future for testing of the efficacy of novel
therapeutic strategies in relevant clinical populations. NOAC brings together an outstanding team of
interdisciplinary investigators and is supported by an Administrative Core, an Animal Models and Cell
Isolation Core, a Clinical Core and a Pilot Projects Core. NOAC utilizes outstanding state-of-the-art facilities at
3 premier research institutions in Cleveland, Cleveland Clinic, Case Western Reserve University and
MetroHealth Hospital, as well as at our ancillary sites at Northeast Ohio Medical University, University of Toledo
and Nationwide Children’s Hospital at the Ohio State University. Four Research Components (RC) are
proposed: RC1 (Brown) investigates the interaction between ethanol, gut microbial metabolites and circadian
clocks and tests “drug-the-bug” strategies to prevent injury, RC2 (Davalos) interrogates the impact of ethanol
activation of microglial cells and neuroinflammation using state-of-the-art live imaging two photon microscopy;
RC3 (Dasarathy) is designed to understand the impact of chronic ethanol on skeletal muscle wasting, a critical
co-morbid feature of alcoholic liver disease and tests the efficacy of targeted nutrients to prevent sarcopenia and
RC4 (Nagy) investigates cell specific mechanisms of hepatocellular death via necroptosis/apoptosis and
develops circulating biomarkers for liver injury. The long-term goal of NOAC is to translate novel findings on
the specific mechanisms by which ethanol disrupts cellular and organ function into effective treatment strategies
for patients with alcoholic tissue injury. Our outstanding investigative team and excellent Core facilities will
continue to work collaboratively to address key mechanistic and translational problems of alcohol-induced tissue
injury, providing unique strengths for translating novel findings the molecular and cellular mechanisms of ethanol
action and disease progression into the development of treatment strategies."
10609965,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Multiple lines of evidence in both humans and animal models suggest that neuroinflammation, mediated via
reactive gliosis, plays a critical role associated with the initiation and progression of vascular contributions to
cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), potentially suggesting convergent
pathophysiological mechanisms. In particular, several of these neuroinflammatory hallmarks in comorbid
VCID/AD animal models have been linked with the dysfunctional responses of reactive astrocytes. In the
healthy brain, it is well known that astrocytes play a critical role in maintaining a variety of homeostatic
mechanisms. However, as a response to injury or disease, astrocytes are able to rapidly respond, in a
generalized description referred as astrogliosis, with a variety of neuroinflammatory modalities, which recent
evidence suggests may cause dysfunctional responses of neurons. Contemporary work has demonstrated a
critical component to these dystrophic neuroinflammatory response of astrocytes is their utilization of canonical
NFkB (RelA) signaling pathway. However, relatively little is known regarding the role of RelA in astrocytes
exposed to the co-morbid degenerative milieu in VCID/AD, representing a critical knowledge gap for the field.
Our overarching hypothesis for this proposal is that astrocytic RelA represents a convergent
inflammatory mechanism driving dysfunctional sequelae in the comorbid VCID/AD milieu. This proposal
will examine three specific aims to determine how RelA utilization by astrocytes shapes both intrinsic and non-
cell autonomous dysfunctional responses to the comorbid VCID/AD degenerative environment:
 1. Determine the capacity of astrocytic-RelA in propagating inflammatory phenotypes of microglia and
 astrocytes in comorbid VCID/AD.
 2. Determine the role of astrocytic-RelA in driving cerebrovascular dysfunction in comorbid VCID/AD.
 3. Determine if synaptic and cognitive dysfunction in VCID/AD is linked with RelA expression in astrocytes."
10611794,"While, the mechanism(s) underlying Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) remain obscure, hindering the development of
novel effective therapy, there is general consensus that calcium (Ca2+) plays a role. Our hypothesis is that
adrenergic and oxidative stress cause a leak in intracellular Ca2+ release channels/ryanodine receptors (RyR2)
in neurons resulting in AD neuropathology and cognitive dysfunction. In support of this hypothesis others have
shown that dantrolene, which acts on RyR channels, improves cognitive function and reduces Aβ plaques in
AD mice. However, more work is needed because the mechanisms causing RyR2 dysfunction and their
correlation with abnormal intracellular Ca2+ handling and Aβ plaques in AD remain elusive. We have
demonstrated that leaky RyR2 channels in the brain, caused by PKA hyperphosphorylation, oxidation/S-
nitrosylation, and depletion of the stabilizing subunit calstabin2 from the channel, play a key role in stress-
induced cognitive dysfunction using a chronic restraint stress murine model of PTSD with significant cognitive
dysfunction (Liu et al, Cell 2012). The stress-induced cognitive dysfunction was rescued either by
administering S107, a novel Rycal developed in the PIs laboratory that stabilizes RyR-calstabin interactions
and prevents intracellular Ca2+ leak, or by genetic ablation of the RyR2 PKA phosphorylation site at Ser2808
(S2808) in mice (RyR2-S2808A+/+ knock-in), implicating leaky RyR2 and adrenergic signaling in the etiology
of AD associated cognitive dysfunction. Our new preliminary data show that RyR2 channels in the human AD
patient brains and in three murine models of familial Alzheimer’s Disease (FAD), are PKA hyperphosphorylated,
oxidized/S-nitrosylated, and depleted of the stabilizing subunit calstabin2, a biochemical “signature” that
denotes a pathological intracellular Ca2+ leak. Preventing RyR2 leak BOTH genetically or pharmacologically
normalizes Ca2+ signaling, reduces amyloid plaque formation in APP+/-/PS1+/- and in 3XTg-AD
(APPswe/PS1Psen1/TauP301L) mice, and improves learning and memory as well as long-term potentiation (LTP)
and long-term depression (LTD). Using a genetic approach we show that knock-in mice with leaky RyR2
channels (RyR2-S2808D+/+ knock-in) have leaky hippocampal RyR2 and premature cognitive dysfunction.
The aims are: Aim 1) RyR-mediated pathological calcium dysregulation in AD: identify upstream signals. Aim 2)
RyR mediated pathological calcium dysregulation in AD: identify downstream signals. Aim 3) Determine key
calcium dependent mechanisms in AD pathogenesis."

Abstract
The gap between basic research advances and new clinical insights and treatments remains a
critical obstacle to progress in the field of alcoholism research. This translational neuroscience
mission is the enduring focus of the Center for the Translational Neuroscience of Alcoholism
(CTNA). CTNA conducts groundbreaking molecular neuroscience, molecular genetics,
functional and chemical neuroimaging, and psychopharmacology studies in the service of
providing new insights to bridge the gap between basic and clinical research. This renewal
application will study how inhibition of mGluR5 might normalize disturbances in cortico-striatal
glutamate signaling arising from upregulation of NMDA-R and, in so doing, attenuate both goal-
oriented (model-based learning) and habitual (model-free learning) alcohol consumption in
animals and reduce alcohol consumption in human heavy drinkers. In so doing, we propose the
first translational neuroscience evaluation of the therapeutic potential of mGluR5 NAM’s, a
mechanism that has received intensive preclinical study. Building upon its prior achievements,
The CTNA will facilitate transdisciplinary research within projects and across projects and with
other alcohol focused initiatives nationally. It will also continue its highly productive Pilot Projects
Core that provides an open competitive mechanism to enable the Center to rapidly encompass
innovative new research and to engage outstanding investigators new to alcoholism research.
CTNA will continue to expand its educational mission, building on the success of the the
International Conference on the Applications of Neuroimaging to Alcoholism."
10834911,"Project Summary
The same pattern of neural activity can correspond to multiple events in the world. Signals sweeping across
the retina, for instance, might be generated by a moving object or by the animal's self-motion. The brain
resolves this ambiguity by inferring what events best explain sensory activity. This process, called causal
inference, is a foundation of action-perception loops in all sensory-motor systems. To support adaptive action,
neural representations of variables involved in these computations should be internally consistent. Yet little is
known about how such internal models arise, evolve, and interact. This proposal focuses on the neural
representations, circuits, and dynamics underlying causal inference in perception of object motion and depth
during self-motion. Because the relationships among these variables are defined by physics, not arbitrary
trained associations, and because they are likely represented by different cortical areas, the project will be able
to study how intercortical connections communicate to maintain an internally consistent view of reality. The
overall hypothesis is that causal inference involves computations in parietal and/or prefrontal cortex, and the
resulting signals are fed back to sensory areas to update neural representations of task-related variables.
 Project A will use Bayesian modeling to develop the theoretical framework for studying causal inference in
traditional trial-based tasks, and then combine this approach with real-time rational control theory to model
continuous, dynamic tasks. These models will be used to fit behavioral data and generate quantitative
predictions to compare with behavioral and neural responses in Projects B and C. Using trial-based tasks in
monkeys, Project B will ask how causal inference modulates neural correlates of flow parsing (in which
background motion influences perception of object motion), will examine how sensory representations are
updated by causal inference about object motion, and will use chemical and optogenetic inactivation to identify
the specific neural pathways that are necessary for such updating of sensory representations. In naturalistic,
continuous navigation tasks, Project C will use similar recording and neural manipulation approaches to
examine the neural dynamics of causal inference in monkeys, and will map neural correlates of dynamic
causal inference across the entire mouse brain in high-density neural recordings. The Data Science Core will
formalize procedures for storing and sharing data, and develop a standard data-processing pipeline, while the
Administrative Core will coordinate among the team and manage internal and external advisory committees.
 These comprehensive research efforts are expected to identify direct correlates of causal inference in single
neurons and neural populations and determine how the resulting beliefs about states of the world are
propagated from decision-making regions back to sensory regions of the brain. Successful completion of this
work will illuminate the functional roles of feedback projections and neural coding in sensory areas of the brain,
move the field toward naturalistic continuous behavior, and help close the loop between perception and action."
10875742,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorder manifested by
cognitive and memory deterioration. The characteristic pathology changes in AD are fibrin
deposition in cerebral cortex, likely through the deposition of beta-amyloid (Aβ) in cell space and
hyperphosphorylated Tau protein in cell. However, the exact molecular mechanism and pathogenic
signaling of AD is not clear and researchers have been searching for new leads and reliable
diagnosis for AD. In this R01 study that focuses on innovative and translational AD research, we will
introduce novel strategies at the forefront of basic disease mechanism and clinical perspectives.
The long term goal of this project is 1) to develop systematic strategies to dissect kinase-substrate
signaling network related to onset of AD, with an emphasis on the identification and validation of
direct kinase-substrate relationship in AD’s critical pathogenic pathways; and 2) to develop
phosphorylated proteins in plasma extracellular vesicles (EVs) for potential clinical diagnosis. As
phosphorylation is a major player in early onset and progression of diseases such as AD, EV
phosphoproteins are expected to become actively pursued targets as indicators of cellular states
and for in vitro disease diagnosis. We will integrate novel proteomic approaches to identify Aβ and
Tau upstream kinases associated with the pathogenesis of AD and to dissect Aβ and Tau-
associated signaling networks. The strategy, fluorescence complementation mass spectrometry
(FCMS), will utilize protein complementation and quantitative proteomics to establish a high
throughput screening method to identify direct upstream kinases of Aβ and Tau associated with the
AD progression. Accordingly, we will achieve the following specific aims: 1): Understanding the
driving force of AD progression through the construction of high resolution kinase-substrate network
in Aβ and Tau associated signaling pathways; 2): Establishment of an analytical platform for
targeted detection of known AD biomarkers in plasma EVs; and 3): Discovery of phosphoproteins
from plasma EVs as novel biomarkers for AD detection and monitoring."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) threatens to devastate society worldwide. For every 5 years of age over age 65, the
prevalence of AD doubles, costing an estimated $277 billion in the U.S. in 2018, a $20 billion increase from the
previous year. Here we propose a coordinated global study of brain aging and AD, that uses novel approaches
to assess the white matter microstructure of the brain’s neural pathways - a crucial brain metric that breaks down
on the pathway from molecular AD pathology to clinical decline. With a novel deep learning tool, called FiberNET,
we extract and analyze the brain’s white matter fiber bundles obtained from diffusion MRI (dMRI) scans across
the world, and answer 3 key questions: how do the brain’s tracts age worldwide? How does tract aging depend
on sex, Alzheimer’s genetic risk, and brain amyloid load? Can tract metrics predict clinical decline better, when
combined with standard, accepted biomarkers of AD? The proposal unites experts in AD, neuroimaging, machine
learning, and large-scale genomics, to relate new aging metrics (tract microstructure) to protective and adverse
factors. Novel mathematics include innovations in picking up crossing fibers and tissue properties from multi-
shell diffusion MRI, and convolutional neural nets to learn patterns of aging in neural pathways worldwide. We
aim to (1) use FiberNET, our deep learning method, to extract tracts from brain dMRI scans worldwide, and
create normative charts for normal tract aging in 20,000 people across the lifespan; (2) ask how the tract aging
trajectory depends on sex, the AD protective genotype APOE2, risk genotype APOE4, and brain amyloid load
measured with amyloid-sensitive PET. The proposed study will create standardized charts of white matter tract
integrity across the lifespan to serve as a guidepost for normative white matter aging. We build on our ENIGMA-
Lifespan work - which analyzed brain MRI data from 10,144 people from 91 cohorts - to create lifespan charts
for the brain’s major tracts from dMRI, yielding fundamental normative information for comparisons of AD groups
worldwide. This lifespan approach will aid the discovery of personal factors that accelerate aging relative to
population norms (e.g., sex, APOE genotype, and amyloid load). To ensure the impact of the developments, we
created a team of beta-testers to help test and refine the methods, that is tightly integrated into our ENIGMA
consortium, which is dedicated to cross-cohort data harmonization. This global approach to aging and AD will
offer a new source of power to “break the logjam” in discovering factors that affect the brain as we age."
10903930,"Since 1976, the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) has surveilled participants for incident dementia, initially, in the
Generation 1 participants, starting 1979 in the Generation 2 cohorts and in 1994 with the smaller multi-ethnic
Omni Generation 1 cohort. As the oldest of the Generation 3 and Omni Generation 2 move into the age of
dementia risk, we extended surveillance to these two younger cohorts. Baseline and repeat neuropsychological
(NP) assessments and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans have been conducted since 1999 on the
Gen 1, Gen 2 and OmniGen 2 cohorts and since 2008 with the younger cohorts. Importantly, over nearly 7
decades, FHS has collected many co- morbid features linked to future risk of late life cognitive decline and
dementia across these cohorts when they were early to middle age. Complementing the health and lifestyle data
is the availability of genetic and peripheral biomarker data. Further, beginning in 2005, digital capture of spoken
responses was added to NP testing. This was extended to written responses in 2011, allowing quantification of
spoken and written responses at levels of granularity that can detect preclinical cognitive changes that traditional
NP test scores cannot measure. Previously, we have capitalized on the multi-generation uniqueness using
genome-wide approaches to discern novel genetic associations for AD risk and AD-related traits that were not
identified in datasets up to 20 times larger. The primary goal of this FHS Brain Aging Program (FHS-BAP) is
to continue dementia surveillance, extend longitudinal characterization of cognitive phenotypes and brain
structure, bring added resources to the brain donation program including neuropathological examination, in the
FHS cohorts in order to identify new and expand on known AD-related genetic and other risk factors and
biomarkers and to pursue innovative research about the vascular and inflammatory basis of AD. Another central
objective of FHS-BAP is to facilitate more widespread sharing of this extraordinary AD data resource with the
broader scientific community. Under a new organizational structure, Administrative, Clinical, Neuropathology and
Data cores will provide a formal management and infrastructure to continue incident dementia surveillance, NP
and MRI assessments of surviving participants of all FHS cohorts, and perform neuropathological examination
of brains obtained through the FHS brain donation program. The FHS-BAP will feature three inter-related projects
that have a focus on vascular and inflammatory contributors to AD. One project will identify factors that are
associated with AD risk and resilience using longitudinal analyses of FHS data including genetic, various `omic
genetic, clinical, imaging, lifestyle and other traits. A second project will investigate the link between AD genetic
vulnerabilities and chronic peripheral inflammation. A third project will determine genetic and protein alterations
of complement-related genes and glial cell phenotypes that modulate cognitive trajectories and
neuropathological profiles. Finally, this program will promote using FHS-BAP data, especially by early-stage and
non-AD investigators through a pilot projects program and through enhanced and proactive data sharing efforts."
10611788,"Project Summary / Abstract
Vascular biology and white matter may be some of the key junctures that harbor early risk mechanisms that
precipitate vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. This process may start as
early as adolescence and young adulthood, and through our lifespan. While cardiovascular impacts on white
matter health are well-established, our understanding of the lifetime course and the associated mechanisms
are less clear. Our efforts aim to identify the earliest possible vascular biomarkers and risk factors for abnormal
white matter changes for the corresponding cognitive declines. Cardiovascular-brain studies typical focus on
structural imaging changes that are difficult to reverse. We hypothesize that white matter lifespan changes can
be more sensitively tracked by combining standard structural imaging techniques with state-of-the-art
connectome era multimodal imaging. The goal is to uncover novel vascular - white matter mechanisms and
biomarkers that provide early warnings before the irreversible structural changes occur. The proposal builds
upon the productivity of the Amish Connectome Project as baseline data, and leverages the collaboration
between our brain imaging and cardiovascular medicine groups. The Old Order Amish/Mennonite population
has a more uniform genetic profile, rural lifestyle and low alcohol and tobacco use that greatly reduce
uncontrollable variability, thus providing a particularly advantageous platform to study the vascular
mechanisms on white matter. Cerebral white matter will also be studied in the context of predicting white
matter vulnerability to Alzheimer's disease. Tracking when the aberrant vascular – white matter coupling
occurs may provide insights into the timing and mode for more effective prevention. This proposal is
responsive to the new NIH Inclusion Across the Lifespan policy. If successful, the proposed study should
strongly support the prevention goal highlighted in the National Alzheimer's Project Act, which supports
increased public research to prevent the onset of and develop effective treatments for AD by 2025. Prevention
programs can be benefited by more nuanced understanding of the pathways connecting early vascular
changes to irreversible white matter changes. Therefore, we propose to use cutting-edge white matter imaging
that is informative of the underlying mechanisms, combined with standard but state-of-the-art vascular
assessments, to study the interaction between vascular and white matter changes across lifespan."

This renewal application of the Portland Alcohol Research Center (PARC) proposes funding for Years 26 to 30.
Over the years of its existence, the number of Portland investigators engaged in alcohol research has
increased and their associated research efforts and other mutually supportive interactions have matured.
Historically, the PARC is recognized for its combined expertise directed toward the goals of developing and
applying genetic animal models to interrogate mechanisms associated with acute and chronic effects of
alcohol. The PARC has focused on connecting neurocircuitry and genetics as a unique goal, and the
opportunity now exists to comprehensively test focused hypotheses. The PARC renewal is comprised of 4
Research Projects and 4 Cores. Two Projects (P001, P004) are continuing and 2 are new; 1 Core (C001) is
new. We continue to emphasize phenotypes with translational relevance through cutting-edge genetics and
genomics, and add astrocyte transcriptomics and DNA methylomics. The Overall Center Theme unites the
PARC components: The Role of the Tetrapartite Synapse in Risk for and Response to Alcohol Drinking. Our
coordinated research examines the roles of the extracellular matrix (ECM), perineuronal nets, and brain
circuits/synaptic function, applying transcriptomics and methylomics in our animal models. We consider sex
differences, cognitive flexibility, and individual differences in populations at high genetic risk for alcohol
consumption that may inform protective mechanisms. P001 characterizes the transcriptomic profiles of mice
bred for high vs. low alcohol preference, and for residual individual variation in alcohol preference that persists
after strong directional selection for high intake. Cognitive flexibility, a putative predictor of future alcohol
intake, is examined, and there is a unique focus on the primary cilium. P002 considers the role of astrocyte-
expressed ECM proteins and proteases in alcohol drinking, and of ECM glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) relevant
to neuronal plasticity, including hyaluronic acid (HA). P003 integrates mouse and monkey findings via analysis
of the brain methylome of low and heavy alcohol drinking animals of both species. Compelling novel gene
targets and regulatory regions with a role in synaptic plasticity will be investigated by gene editing, circuit
modifications and functional analysis of excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmission. Finally, P004 also integrates
research in monkeys and mice to characterize corticostriatal functional connectivity and synaptic plasticity
associated with deficits in cognitive flexibility and alcohol intake, and to examine the role of HA. The
Administrative Core (AC001) will provide organizational and oversight services for all components of the
Center. The Animal & Resource Core (C001) will generate mice, conduct behavioral phenotyping, and
generate sequencing data for mouse and monkey samples. The Bioinformatics Core (C002) will provide
analytic and data integration services. The Information Dissemination Core (CD001) continues its K-12
focus, and all investigators will participate in its broader educational and outreach activities."

10875733,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affects 5.5 million Americans, producing cognitive deficits and mortality. There are
very limited treatment options for AD, making development of interventions to slow or reverse AD symptoms a
critical area of research. Proteasome function declines in the brain with age, an impairment that is even more
pronounced in patients with AD; this is also seen in animal models of AD. Using in vivo invertebrate and in vitro
vertebrate models of AD, we have found that genetic and pharmacologic augmentation of the proteasome can
delay AD-like cognitive and neurodegenerative symptoms, while reducing proteasome function accelerates AD
progression. Building on these findings, we now propose to investigate (a) the mechanism of action and (b)
efficacy of proteasome manipulation as a possible intervention for AD. This proposal has three goals: 1) To
determine if drug and genetic manipulation of proteasome function reduce AD-like symptoms in mice
that model the disease. This is a natural progression from our prior studies of these interventions in flies and
cell culture and is supported by our strong preliminary data in mice. 2) To elucidate how proteasome
dysfunction is linked to AD progression. We present, and test, two hypotheses to explain this interplay. The
first hypothesis is that the proteasome has a key role in prevention of AD progression through degradation of the
β-amyloid (Aβ) machinery, specifically, amyloid precursor protein (APP), β-secretase (BACE1), and γ-secretase
activating protein (GSAP), all of which are targets of proteasome degradation. If so, it would indicate that age-
related declines in proteasome function result in accumulation of these proteins, which drives AD pathogenesis.
The second hypothesis is that proteasome dysfunction, triggered by Aβ inhibition, drives downstream
neurodegeneration rather than altering Aβ accumulation. Proteasome dysfunction on its own causes
neurodegeneration and synaptic loss. If our findings are consistent with this hypothesis, it would indicate that
proteasome dysfunction caused by Aβ inhibition is an intermediator for AD-induced cognitive deficits and
neurodegeneration. 3) To establish the role and timeline of proteasome dysfunction in AD patients and
the translational potential of our proteasome-targeting interventions. Prior studies report impaired
proteasome function in AD patients beyond that seen in age-matched controls. However, it is unclear if this
impairment is a driver of pathogenesis or a product of disease progression. This investigation will use human
tissue to establish where proteasome dysfunction occurs in the AD cascade and whether it co-varies with disease
state, severity, symptom presentation, and biomarkers of the disease. This will establish the translational
potential of our proteasome-targeting pharmacologic agents. If our investigations are successful, we will enhance
mechanistic understanding of the role of the proteasome system in AD and lay the groundwork for preclinical
trials of a new class of AD-targeting drugs."

transformative research in the biology of aging, and (2) a springboard for advanced educational and training
activities. The Specific Aims of the SA Nathan Shock Center are:
1. To be a leader in research that advances our understanding of the biology of aging
2. To provide a `one-stop-shop' venue to accelerate transformative research in the biology of aging
3. To foster and promote career development of early-stage investigators in aging biology
4. To serve as a resource and partner to investigators from other Shock Centers, institutions, and the public, for
dissemination of scientific knowledge and enhancing awareness about aging research
 To achieve these objectives we have leveraged and streamlined our resources and strengths to create six
interrelated cores: 1) Administration and Program Enrichment Core; 2) Research Development (RD) Core; 3)
Aging Animal Models and Longevity Assessment Core; 4) Integrative Physiology of Aging Core (IPAC); 5)
Pathology Core; and 6) the Analytical Pharmacology and Drug Evaluation Core. These cores will provide an
integrated venue to conduct and facilitate carefully phenotyped and well-integrated (i.e. lifespan, healthspan,
pathology) aging studies. Using these cores, we will apply genetic, biochemical, and pharmacologic
methodologies to several vertebrate animal models including rodents (mice, rats, mole-rats), and marmosets.
Based on our past experiences and successes, we fully anticipate that our enhanced platform and training
activities will greatly facilitate the identification of molecular and cellular mechanisms that influence aging. This
approach will result in novel strategies and the identification of (pharmacologic) targets to extend healthy life
expectancy.
 The SA Shock Center is built on a unique foundation provided by UTHSCSA's exceptional and tightly
integrated resources: a Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center (OAIC), a site of the
Interventions Testing Program (ITP), a Geriatric Research, Education and Clinical Center (GRECC), a T32
Training Grant on Geroscience, and a robust Barshop Institute that unites aging research at UTHSCSA. We are
the only Shock Center with all of these synergistic components available. In addition, the SA Shock Center
receives unparalleled institutional commitment (~$500,000/year), including a new ~$100M 109,000 sq. ft.
building – specific for the Barshop Institute – that will house the Shock Center, the Claude Pepper OAIC and the
ITP in a centrally located facility."
10875749,"Project Summary
The neurovascular unit (NVU) is a functional structure that consists of endothelial cells, surrounded by an
extracellular matrix, neurons, astrocytes, and pericytes. The NVU enables regulation of regional cerebral blood
flow and nutrient delivery to the brain tissue. With aging, a structural weakening of the NVU occurs, which is also
associated with inflammatory signaling and transport deficiencies. Critically, it is not clear how neurons,
astrocytes, pericytes, and endothelial cells undergo senescence in the NVU, and whether there are differences
in senescence pathways between healthy NVU aging and NVU in Alzheimer's diseases (AD).
The G-quadruplex (G4) is a non-canonical DNA secondary structure formed by four DNA strands containing
multiple runs of guanines. G4s play important roles in DNA recombination, replication, and regulation of
transcription. In our data, we demonstrated that brain samples from aged mice contain more G4s than that of
young mice. We showed that mice treated with a small-molecule G4 stabilizer develop cognitive impairment and
accelerated brain aging. Using a heterochronic parabiosis mouse model, we also showed that the levels of G4s
are decreased in the brain of old parabiont, compared to the age-matched iso-parabiotic mice, implicating
presence of rejuvenating factors that can reverse the elevation of G4s with aging. The effect of the old parabiont
on the young partner is more pronounced (more G4s in the young), suggesting a strong negative influence of
aging factors. Importantly, in a mouse model of AD, we demonstrated that G4s are stabilized in the brains, well
before the deposition of amyloid occurs. We hypothesize that these converging lines of evidence point at а
mechanism of senescence. Thus, the primary objective of the proposed studies is to investigate G4-associated
cellular senescence in the NVU, in aging and AD. In Aim 1, we will compare G4s across cell types in the NVU.
In Aim 2, we will determine whether G4s preferentially accumulate in the NVUs of brain regions most vulnerable
to neurodegeneration. In Aim 3, we will investigate how a peripheral factor, CXCL10, contributes to NVU's G4
senescence. G4s might be a novel pathway that can be targeted to mitigate the detrimental effects of cellular
senescence in the brain."

This is an application for a 5 year competitive renewal for the Colorado Nutrition Obesity Research Center
(NORC). The MISSION of the Colorado NORC is to advance the science of nutrition and obesity by facilitating
interdisciplinary, collaborative, translational research and by fostering the development of the next generation of
scientists in the Rocky Mountain region. We are now in our twenty-fifth year of operation, and the Colorado
NORC now supports 118 Regular Members, 22 Affiliate Member trainees, and 38 other Affiliate Member faculty
scientists and educators. Our regular members generate over $51 million annually in direct costs for
nutrition/obesity research. We have secured an additional $20 million in institutional resources to support the
NORC's research and educational objectives over the next 5 years. This investment builds upon a $40 million
investment from the University of Colorado and its philanthropic donors over the past 10 years to construct and
operate the Anschutz Health and Wellness Center and build programmatically in the science of nutrition,
obesity, and wellness. Our research base pursues basic, preclinical, clinical, and community research projects,
with a mindset for interdisciplinary collaboration. The CENTRAL THEME of the Colorado NORC is the
prevention and treatment of obesity and its metabolic complications across the lifespan, through better nutrition,
lifestyle modifications, and medical treatments. We specifically build and foster interdisciplinary research on
nutrition and obesity in five areas: 1) Early Life Influences; 2) Women's Health and Sex Differences; 3) Exercise
and Metabolism; 4) Regulation of Metabolism; and 5) Nutrition and Weight Management Interventions for Better
Health. The Colorado NORC has strong leadership with Dr. Paul MacLean (Director) and Dr. Daniel Bessesen
(Associate Director), who will coordinate the activities of an impactful enrichment program, a successful pilot
program, and three highly productive research cores. They have established strong partnerships with campus
leaders that bridge disciplines for collaborative research. They have guided the cores and programs to adapt to
the changing needs of the NORC's research base. Finally, they have recruited an outstanding team of
core/program leaders and internal/external advisors that will ensure the Colorado NORC accomplishes its
mission. After 25 years of operation, the Colorado has never been as well-positioned to advance the science of
nutrition and obesity on so many fronts and to foster the next generation of leaders in these fields."
10609964,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The blood-brain barrier (BBB) has a fundamental role in maintaining brain tissue homeostasis. While
dysfunction of the BBB is a common feature of many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD), but also small vessel diseases (SVD) such as cerebral autosomal
dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), it is still unclear whether
BBB dysfunction precedes the onset of neurological disorders or is a consequence of their aggravating pathology.
Converging evidence indicates that dysfunction of the BBB correlates with an abnormal perivascular deposition
and aggregation of proteins such as amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau in AD, or granular osmiophilic material (GOM) and
the NOTCH3 ectodomain in CADASIL. These proteins are known to interact with the proteins that make up the
extracellular matrix (ECM) and the basement membranes of cerebral blood vessels. Cumulative protein
aggregation leads to functional impairment of the ECM and causes damage to the cellular components of the
neurovascular unit (NVU), promoting BBB breakdown and affecting the mechanisms of protein transport across
the BBB. Thus, there is a vicious cycle between BBB dysfunction and aberrant protein accumulation that
progresses with age, leading to cognitive impairment and death. Understanding this cycle is crucial to elucidate
the mechanistic links between BBB dysfunction and dementia, and to identify therapeutic opportunities to
preserve BBB function. We hypothesize that aberrant protein accumulation and BBB dysfunction contribute
synergistically in AD/ADRD and CADASIL through a common mechanistic link. Using well-established mouse
models of AD and CADASIL, we propose to investigate the effects of perivascular protein aggregation on both
structural (Aim 1) and functional (Aim 2) properties of the BBB, to understand how perivascular protein
aggregation relates to structural changes of the NVU that leads to BBB dysfunction. We will then investigate
whether the mechanical disruption of the BBB contributes to perivascular protein deposition and aggregation
(Aim 3). These experiments will provide crucial knowledge on the molecular and cellular mechanisms of
interaction between protein aggregation and BBB breakdown, and may ultimately unravel novel therapeutic
targets aimed at preserving cerebrovascular health and BBB function."

This application is for renewal of the Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in the Basic Biology of Aging
at the University of Washington and affiliated institutions. This Center has over the past 25 years
provided key resources in support of investigators who study the biology of aging. This application
continues a theme that emphasizes outreach and service to the broadest community of investigators
in the gerosciences. Of proximal relevance is the characterization of aging-related phenotypes of
longevity and healthspan. As our Center services must be easily accessible to outside users, our
Longevity and Healthspan Core (Core E) focuses on invertebrate assays, many of them novel. Two
other Resources Cores focus on the high dimensional assessments that are closely related to aging
phenotypes: Protein Phenotypes of Aging (Core C) and Metabolite Phenotypes of Aging (Core D).
Sophisticated computational and bioinformatic tools for data analysis and optimal insight are provided
by the Artificial Intelligence and Bioinformatics Core F. Each of these four Resource Cores is led by
highly respected experts in that field, including Michael MacCoss and Judit Villen (Core C), Daniel
Promislow (Core D), Matt Kaeberlein and Maitreya Dunham (Core E) and Su-In Lee (Core F). Each
will push the envelope of appropriate technologies, developing new state-of-the art approaches for
assessments that are the most applicable to gerontology and making them accessible to the national
aging community. The Research Development Core (Core B) will continue to support pilot and junior
faculty studies, with a firm focus on outreach of service to the national geroscience constituency. The
Administrative and Program Enrichment Core (Core A) supports administrative management, an
external advisory panel, courses, and data sharing and dissemination. Core A’s program of seminars
and symposia will continue a focus on sponsorship and organization of national courses, meetings
and pre-meetings, as well as workshops in the fields allied to our Resource Core Services. In
coordination with other Nathan Shock Centers, we will support a new Geropathology Research
initiative."

The biology of aging field is at an inflection point; driven by 30 years of discoveries that have revealed
mechanisms of aging and lifespan determination. Until recently, these studies were deemed
phenomenological, but geroscientists are now transforming the way we approach the study of chronic diseases
and the practice of medicine itself. For this transformation to be sustainable, the basic biology of aging field
must expand. Critical for this expansion, is the training of the next generation of geoscientists. Here we present
an innovative program of activities, with a strong emphasis on training, designed to overcome these
challenges. This includes many Research Sabbaticals, a pilot project scheme and a voucher funding
mechanism to open outside investigators to an unmatched technology platform for aging research."
10875692,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Senescent cells develop a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) involving pro-inflammatory and
pro-oxidative factors that can elicit deleterious paracrine-like effects on neighboring cells. Independently of the
original stressor, senescence can also spread from senescent to non-senescent bystander cells in a process
known as senescence-induced senescence (SIS). Neurons were historically considered to be unable to undergo
cellular senescence. Recent research has however provided evidence that neurons may be able to undergo
senescence during normal aging and disease. Senolytic drugs, which selectively kill senescent cells, have for
example been shown to improve functions in the brains of animal models of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related
dementias. This new approach is of great importance—clinical trials investing efficacy of amyloid beta (Aβ)
antibodies have led to disappointing failures and no known disease-modifying treatments have to date been
identified. There is however a caveat to the use of senolytics for AD and related disorders. It is not known whether
senolytics kill senescent glial cells and spare neurons because they cannot senesce, or if senolytics not only kill
senescent glial cells but also senescent neurons. Senescent cells in the periphery are normally removed by
immune cells including natural killer (NK) cells. Due to its unique immune privilege, senescent cells in the brain
may initially be able to evade removal by NK cells, allowing for an increase and spread in the overall senescent
cell load. When immune privilege becomes compromised in later stages of the disease, this could result in a
large-scale removal of senescent cells including neurons. It is unclear whether this would be beneficial or
detrimental to global brain health. We will initially assess neuronal senescence in mixed primary human
neuronal-astrocytic 2D and 3D cultures recently generated by our laboratory in response to Abeta-mediated
stress. We will then determine the role of senescence in vivo utilizing a well-characterized AD mouse model, the
3xTg AD line. This line has been crossed with a p16-3MR transgenic mouse model that allows the identification
and inducible ablation of senescent cells. Use of these models will allow us to determine: (1) the ability of
neurons, astrocytes, and other CNS cell types to undergo stress-mediated senescence and a SASP, (2) whether
this is accompanied by an Abeta-independent SIS, (3) whether late-stage losses in immune privilege enables
clearance of senescent cells via infiltration of peripheral immune cells, and (4) whether senescent cell removal
is beneficial or detrimental and at what stage of disease progression."
10611806,"Blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction has been shown to play a causal role in both early- and late-onset
Alzheimer's disease (EOAD, LOAD). While much has been learned about the molecular mechanisms of BBB
function and dysfunction in AD from mouse model systems, many important unanswered questions remain
regarding how AD-associated mutations and genetic variants affect human BBB integrity and function.
Improved human experimental systems are required to complement existing animal models. Pioneering
studies by co-PI Ingber have produced microfluidic 3D organ-on-chip models, including a BBB-on-a-chip (BBB-
Chip), increasingly representative of human in vivo physiology. We have adapted this system to create
isogenic iPSC-derived BBB-Chip models of normal human subjects and of subjects with EOAD and LOAD.
The Young-Pearse lab has generated a collection of iPSC lines that capture the diverse set of genetic risk
factors for AD including: EOAD mutation of APP and corrected controls, DS and DS with removal of copies of
high impact chr21 genes, an isogenic APOE series including APOE 2/2, 3/3, 4/4 and KO, and a collection of
lines that we've generated from over 50 individuals in the ROS/MAP cohorts that represent the clinical and
pathological spectrum of LOAD. Here, we propose to combine the BBB-Chip model with the iPSC line
collection to examine the impact of early- and late-onset genetic variants on BBB function, and to define the
molecular pathways impacted by these variants. In the first aim, we address the hypothesis that neurons
expressing EOAD mutations secrete Aβ species that negatively affect BBB integrity through toxic effects on
brain microvasculature endothelial cells (BMVECs). We will use human BBB in vitro models to examine Aβ-
dependent and independent impacts of trisomy 21 and fAD mutation on BBB integrity and function via a)
measurements of transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER), b) permeability assays, and c)
immunocytochemistry and morphological analyses of BBB cells. In addition, we will identify the molecular
pathways affected in EOAD in BMVECs, pericytes and astrocytes via RNA sequencing and unbiased
proteomics. In aim 2, we determine the functional impact of altered composition of Aβ aggregates on clearance
of pathologic Aβ across the BBB. To this end, we will use a variety of well defined synthetic Aβ species as well
as human neuron-derived and brain-derived Aβ to systematically define how Aβ composition and aggregation
state affects: 1) uptake and transcytosis of Aβ across the BBB and 2) integrity of the BBB and health of the
pericytes, astrocytes and BMVECs composing the BBB. Finally, in the third aim we address the hypothesis that
the LOAD risk genes SORL1 and CLU work in concert with APOE to mediate Aβ clearance by the BBB. In this
aim, we will determine the functional consequences of variants of APOE, CLU and SORL1 on BBB integrity
and Aβ clearance. Finally, we will determine the molecular consequences of modulation of APOE, CLU and
SORL1 in BMVECs, pericytes and astrocytes in our human BBB experimental system."

Major scientific and therapeutic advances have improved outcomes of patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (B-ALL) over the last four decades. Addition of ABL1 kinase inhibitors to chemotherapy has significantly
improved relapse-free and overall survival of children and adults with the Philadelphia chromosome positive
(Ph+) ALL subtype. This great treatment success has been attributed to oncogenic addiction of Ph+ leukemias
to BCR-ABL1-driven signaling and the ability of ABL1 kinase inhibitors to induce profound cytotoxicity.
Philadelphia chromosome-like (Ph-like) ALL is an analogous high-risk leukemia subtype driven by various non-
BCR-ABL1 genetic lesions that similarly activate oncogenic kinase signaling. Ph-like B-ALL occurs in 15-40% of
children and adults with B-ALL and is associated with a particularly high risk of relapse and death. We identified
constitutively activated JAK2/STAT5, PI3K and B cell receptor-like (BCR) signaling in CRLF2-rearranged Ph-like
ALL, which can be abrogated with JAK1/2 (ruxolitinib), PI3Kδ (idelalisib), and SRC (dasatinib) inhibition in vitro
and in vivo in preclinical models. However, while the triple inhibition results in complete cell death in vitro and
significant decrease of the leukemia burden of mice, we doubt that this treatment strategy is clinically translatable
for patients given potential for appreciable toxicity. We thus focused on discovering vulnerabilities induced by
JAK2-kinase inhibition and identified i) high activity of SGK1, a molecule known to induce drug resistance to
PI3K inhibitors in PI3Kα-mutated breast cancer patients, ii) complete inactivity and downregulation of PTPN6, a
phosphatase known to downregulate JAK2, PI3K, and BCR signaling, and iii) accumulation of DNA damage with
JAK2 inhibition. We hypothesized that activation of SGK1 and inactivation of PTPN6 are required mechanisms
to overcome JAK2 inhibitor-induced signaling inhibition. Strikingly, our preliminary data demonstrated that
targeting activated SGK1 in JAK2 inhibitor treated samples results in potent in vitro cell death. Furthermore, we
hypothesized that the JAK2-inhibitor induced DNA-damage is mediated by the RAG endonuclease complex,
which is activated during B cell differentiation to form the BCR. It has been shown that JAK2/STAT5 signaling is
downregulated in differentiating B cells to induce a proliferation arrest, which prevents cells from dying from
apoptosis during V(D)J recombination. Our preliminary data demonstrate that we can exploit this conserved
mechanism by targeting the DNA-damage response molecule CHK1 in JAK2 inhibitor treated Ph-like ALL cells,
which may result in massive leukemic cell death due to accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage. The proposed
study aims to uncover previously unknown mechanisms of drug resistance and to characterize the underlying
biology of Ph-like B-ALL cells to ultimately establish preclinical treatment protocols with the goal to prevent
relapse and to cure patients with Ph-like B-ALL."

The Michigan Nutrition Obesity Research Center (MNORC) was initially funded in 2010 to
support, integrate and enhance research related to obesity and nutrition among the faculty of
the University of Michigan. The goal of MNORC is to create an environment to encourage and
enable researchers from preclinical, clinical and translational research disciplines to integrate
advanced, phenotyping and data analytic tools to more fully define individual and population
characteristics that arise in response to dietary nutrient composition or amount.
This will be accomplished by providing core laboratory infrastructure, educational and training
opportunities and pilot grants to enhance research productivity. The MNORC has expanded the
research infrastructure and Core offerings in response to the needs of the research community
and has supported the expansion of nutrition and obesity research across the UM campus. This
is highlighted by the institutional investment to establish two new cores that are part of this
proposal. MNORC has 102 members that are faculty across the various schools at UM. These
faculty currently control just under $26M/year of direct costs in nutrition/obesity-related funding
for R-awards and funding from non-NIH sources and an additional $30M/year in
nutrition/obesity-related F, K, P, T and U grants. The MNORC Cores include the Administrative
Core, which will oversee and integrate the research, clinical and education functions of the
Center, including an annual symposium, seminar series, training for undergraduates, dieticians,
medical students, house staff and fellows in the breadth of nutrition and obesity care and
research; the Nutrition, Exercise and phenotype Testing Core, which will provide expertise
and infrastructure for sophisticated metabolic and neurobehavioral testing of humans in inpatient
and outpatient settings; the Molecular Phenotyping Core, which will continue supporting
targeted and untargeted metabolomics profiling as well as new initiatives for multi-omics data
integration; the newly established Adipose Tissue Core will provide expertise and technical
services to basic and clinical biomedical researchers interested in investigating how adipocytes
throughout the body develop, function, and interact with other cell types; the Childhood
Obesity Research Core will support investigators focused on translational research in
childhood overweight/obesity by leveraging learning health systems and health information
technology at the University of Michigan. MNORC will continue to support the Weight
Management Program which integrates research into a highly successful adult clinical weight loss
program and is now being extended into children, families and women seeking to become pregnant.
Numerous investigators access the patients, biosamples and data collected through this program
for their own research. Through the next funding period, MNORC will continue to communicate
with the research base to identify new areas for support and adjust the service offerings
consistent with the needs of the community."
10893410,"UCSF NORC Overview: Summary
The UCSF NORC integrates multiple research programs across several different areas of nutrition, obesity and
metabolism. Over the last twelve years, UCSF has actively expanded its research base in these critical subject
areas, and for the last four years, the NORC has greatly aided the recent phases of this expansion.
Specifically, this robust research base has benefitted from an administrative and facilities infrastructure
reflecting the diversity of the departments and centers pushing to expand NORC-relevant research at UCSF.
Renewal of the NORC will sustain this cohesive programmatic, administrative and shared facilities
infrastructure in order to further integrate the already strong research conducted at UCSF, providing a
framework for its coordinated future growth.
The UCSF NORC includes cellular, animal, translational, clinical, epidemiological, and behavioral research
directions. Despite this breadth, these programs are highly interactive with extensive collaborations amongst
even the most divergent of programs. For example, radiologists collaborate with clinical scientists to non-
invasively visualize metabolism in humans. Human geneticists collaborate with cellular and animal researchers
to investigate hypotheses more tractable in those systems. Behavioral scientists coordinate with nutritionists to
search for ways to improve outcomes. In all, the 58 interdisciplinary investigators within the UCSF-NORC
consist of a mixture of senior and early stage investigators with a collective 78 NIH grants relevant to obesity,
metabolism and nutrition research. Their collective goal is to define the underlying mechanisms of disease and
to significantly contribute to the prevention and treatment of obesity and its complications.
The purpose of the UCSF-NORC is to promote and grow research in obesity, nutrition, and metabolism at
UCSF and throughout northern California. This is realized by:
· Maintaining, improving, and promoting the interactions and collaborations of researchers in the field with
each other and with those outside the field.
· Supporting the maintenance and evolution of state-of-the-art Research Cores to meet the needs of obesity,
nutrition, and metabolism research.
· Facilitating the development of new research directions and the entry of new researchers into the field via
Pilot & Feasibility opportunities.
· Enriching the NORC research community through pertinent educational forums and other venues that
support the development and maintenance of research interactions.
· Integrating administrative support to ensure that the infrastructure meets the needs of the local obesity,
nutrition and metabolism research community."

designed to provide unprecedented service to the scientific community throughout the nation. The Multiplexing
Protein Analysis Core provides investigators novel mass spectrometry methods for measuring the abundance
of proteins from any tissue/cell from any organism that has its genome sequenced. The Core can quantify panels
of ~50 proteins in a single run. Using D2O labeling, the Core can also measure the synthesis and turnover of
these proteins. In combination, these analyses facilitate interrogation of proteomic changes in pathways
of importance to aging and Geroscience. The Genomic Sciences Core has developed assays to measure
both the methylation and hydroxymethylation of DNA at specific sites in the genome, which will be
available to investigators studying epigenetics of aging. The Core also offers researchers the
comprehensive analysis of mitochondrial genome heteroplasmy (variants/mutations and deletions) and copy

10611787,"Splicing dysregulation, caused by defects in RNA-binding splice factors including TDP-43, is
considered a hallmark and potential driver of neuronal dysfunction and cognitive decline in
Alzheimer’s (AD) and Related Dementia (ADRD). Although substantial evidence suggests that
genetic causes of splicing dysfunction are not limited to neuronal cells, splicing defects in the
BBB endothelium in AD and ADRD have not been examined. Defects in the BBB increase with
age and early in the progression of AD and ADRD, where they contribute to disease
progression. Through in vivo informatics and in vitro CRISPR screening, we identified TDP-43
and several other AD and ADRD associated splice factors as regulators of post-transcriptional
splicing in the endothelium in response to sterile inflammation. Using a novel method to isolate
endothelial nuclei from frozen banked human brain tissues, we identified reduced nuclear TDP-
43 levels in endothelial cells of the blood brain barrier (BBB) with age and in AD and ADRD
patients. Furthermore, in a novel mouse model, we show that specific deletion of TDP-43 from
the brain endothelium leads to leak across the BBB, and activation of the microvasculature and
microglial cells. Here, we hypothesize that loss of nuclear TDP-43 in the endothelium
contributes to defects in the BBB and microvasculature, and to AD and ADRD by affecting the
splicing of pre-mRNA required for the maintenance of a quiescent endothelium. We propose to
examine TDP-43 expression and splicing activity in the endothelium in human AD and ADRD,
and the effect of loss of nuclear TDP-43 on disease progression in mouse models of AD and the
ADRD Frontal temporal lobe dementia (FTLD). Furthermore, since our novel techniques will
allow us an unprecedented view of the endothelium in AD and ADRD, we propose to extend our
work on TDP-43 to broadly examine splicing alterations in the endothelium in these disease
states, and use our established bioinformatics and in vitro screening approaches to determine
whether defects in other endothelial splice factors also contribute to BBB dysfunction. The
completion of this work will provide new insight into the contributions of post-transcriptional
regulation by RNA-binding proteins to BBB defects, microvascular dysfunction and the
progression of AD and ADRD."
10850829,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Overall
Since aging is the biggest risk factor of most human diseases and the overall functional decline in individuals,
there is great interest in understanding its biological underpinnings, with the ultimate goal of increasing the
number of healthy and productive years of human life (i.e., healthspan). Conserved mechanisms of aging and
longevity have been identified via investigations into the basic biology of aging. These include studies in model
organisms that have also shown that aging is pliable, opening the door for healthspan-promoting interventions.
However, a major complicating factor that impedes our understanding of aging and our ability to intervene is
the intrinsic and induced heterogeneity of the process. Distinct cell types have intrinsically different aging
modalities, and even identical cell types age at different rates depending on physiological context or
environmental exposures. These and other cellular heterogeneities (e.g., altered epigenetic states and gene
expression) can drive tissue dysfunction and age-related pathology that ultimately impact healthspan and
lifespan. Unravelling this complexity experimentally requires application of robust single-cell and imaging
approaches to address the heterogeneity of cellular aging head-on, as well as computational and mathematical
modelling approaches to illuminate aging networks and pathway interactions that involve known hallmarks of
aging. Another major gap in aging research is the need for new and better human cell and tissue models to
allow basic research directly relevant to human aging. Thus, the overarching premise of the proposed San
Diego Nathan Shock Center (SD-NSC) is to create the requisite infrastructure to facilitate and promote the
systematic study of cellular heterogeneity in aging and to provide novel cell and tissue models for basic human
aging studies. The SD-NSC will establish cutting-edge Research Resource Cores focused on: 1) novel human
cell and organoid models of aging, including from a unique human aging cohort that is annotated for physical
and functional measures of biological age, 2) single-cell and high resolution -omics and imaging techniques,
and 3) computational modelling of aging networks. The SD-NSC Research Resource Cores will provide
scientific services to the NSC Network and the aging research community, and disseminate samples, datasets
protocols, and computational tools. These resources will be complemented by a Research Development Core
and Center outreach activities that will provide: 1) pilot grants and customized mentoring programs to
encourage and support early-stage and established investigators new to aging research, 2) innovative in-
person and virtual training in advanced methods and technologies to address cellular heterogeneity, and 3)
intellectual leadership through novel programming to encourage collaboration and the dissemination of
knowledge related to the basic biology of aging. The SD-NSC will bring together complementary expertise and
resources from three renowned San Diego research Institutions with the common goal of understanding the
role of cellular heterogeneity in aging to ultimately enable interventions to extend human healthspan."
10875732,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The long-term goal of this project is to understand the age-related, neuron-microglia-astrocyte-specific proteome
dynamics and interaction in the brain and their deregulation in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
Our ongoing large-scale profiling of transcriptome and proteome in bulk AD brain tissue have revealed that the
transcriptome is often not an accurate indicator of protein abundance, due to posttranscriptional events, such as
protein turnover. Genetic studies have revealed over 20 AD-related genes, many of which are associated with
specific cell types. We hypothesize that dysfunction of neuron-microglia-astrocyte interaction contributes to AD
pathogenesis, and propose to use the latest cutting edge technologies to profile cell type specific proteome, in
situ transcriptome, and proteome turnover in the three cell populations from multiple common AD-related mouse
models, to decipher molecular signaling networks in disease development, and to validate targets in human AD
cases, mouse models, and human organoid models. Three specific aims are: (i) to disentangle dynamic neuron-
microglia-astrocyte-specific proteome and interaction in AD mice by BONCAT-mediated single cell type
proteomics and spatial transcriptomics, (ii) to measure cell type-specific proteome-wide protein turnover in AD
by BONCAT pulse-chase analysis, and (iii) to study deregulation of proteome dynamics in human AD cases,
mouse models and brain organoids. Successful outcome of this project will identify novel, cell type specific

10847400,"Project Summary
The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) proposes to renew a Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in
the Basic Biology of Aging focused on comparative bioenergetics and aging. Energetics is comprehensively
defined for this purpose as the study of the causes, mechanisms, and consequences of the acquisition,
storage, and utilization of metabolizable energy. Comparative energetics is the study of metabolic processes at
multiple scales and across multiple species, in this case as it relates to health and aging. Nearly a century of
aging research has reinforced the link between energetics and aging. In modern terms, this link is reified as
dysregulated mitochondrial function, metabolic signaling, and nutrient responsiveness. The twin objectives of
the Center will be to 1) explore in greater depth and detail than previously possible the complex relationship
among cellular and organismal energetics and their relationship to whole organisms' energetics, health, and
aging, and 2) provide quantitative, state-of-the-art technologies and novel methodologies in the assessment
and analysis of bioenergetics to the geroscience community at large. In pursuit of these objectives, we will
continue to provide three Research Cores. 1) The Comparative Organismal Energetics Core (a.k.a.
Organismal Core) will provide expertise and cutting-edge instruction and methodology for determining
complete whole-animal energy balance (intake, assimilation, and expenditure) and body composition, including
regional distribution of white and brown adipose tissue, in living animals of various species, including worms,
flies, fish, mice, or other mammals, under diverse temperature or activity regimes. 2) The Comparative
Mitochondrial Health Assessment Core (a.k.a. Mitometabolism Core) will provide integrated, quantitative
mitochondrial functional analysis at the level of the organelle, cell, or tissue for both traditional and emerging
animal models, including targeted metabolomics, assessment of mitophagy, and oxidative stress.
Mitochondrial-nuclear exchange models also will be available to enable experiments that evaluate the
contribution of mtDNA variation to bioenergetics. 3) The Comparative Data Analytics Core (a.k.a. Analytics
Core) will provide innovative analytic approaches to data sets linking comparative energetics to organismal
health and longevity.
 With these Research Cores plus the Administrative Program Enrichment Core (Admin Core) and Research
Development Core (RDC), we aim to: 1) facilitate hypothesis-driven research and leverage these technologies
into new projects, interactions, and collaborations nationwide in basic aging research; 2) foster meaningful
novel interactions among investigators within UAB and across the region and country; and 3) provide
resources, education, training, and direction to junior investigators through the intellectual resources and
research infrastructure the Center will develop."
10848452,"OVERALL—PROJECT SUMMARY
Healthspan is a complex trait, influenced by many interacting polymorphic alleles and environmental factors that
may accelerate or delay aging, reduce or increase disease risk, and/or promote extended lifespan. Thus,
assessing the role of genetic variation in aging requires an experimental strategy capable of modeling the genetic
and biological complexity of human populations while allowing for efficient identification and validation of
candidate genes. With this proposal, the JAX NSC seeks support to further develop and disseminate the next
generation of genetic, phenotyping, and information resources necessary to enable a systems-wide approach to
understanding healthy aging. Over the past 15 years, The JAX NSC has transformed aging research both at
JAX and across the geroscience community, providing central resources to support investigators that have
resulted in 26 peer-reviewed publications in the last funding period. The Center has developed nascent regional
and national resources for aging research, including aging mouse resources and tissues that support our
numerous collaborations and external researchers. All JAX NSC data and tools are publicly disseminated on the
Mouse Phenome Database and the JAX NSC website, thus ensuring that the resources generated and expertise
acquired through the Center is readily available to the aging research community. In this renewal, we will advance
towards our goal by providing unique resources, tools, and support to geroscience investigators while leveraging
JAX's unparalleled expertise in the large-scale identification and functional validation of complex polygenic traits
in mice. We will do this by providing effective Center administration and enhancing the utility of JAX NSC
resources throughout the aging community (Aim 1); expanding the research focus on aging, healthspan and
age-related diseases through a robust Research Development Core (Aim 2); increasing the diversity of mouse
resources available for aging research, including a new study to, for the first time, investigate the effect of genetic
variation on cellular senescence and treatment with senolytic drugs (Aim 3); strengthening the data and
computational and support available to the aging community (Aim 4); expanding the use of machine learning
technologies in interpretation of aging pathologies (Aim 5). The Center will be led by a highly experienced team
of Principal Investigators and Core Leaders who, with oversight from an External Advisory Board, will provide
effective management to facilitate the goals and objectives of the Center. The Center will leverage unparalleled
institutional resources, facilities and expertise of The Jackson Laboratory, a globally renowned institution for
mouse genetics research, to enhance its goals and the utility of the resources it generates for the aging research
community."
10875736,"Project Summary/Abstract
Cellular senescence is a general stress response that is triggered by many stimuli, including telomere
dysfunction, DNA damage, oxidative stress, aberrant oncogenic signaling and chronic inflammation. Senescent
cells cease proliferation, undergo metabolic and transcriptional changes and secrete various pro-inflammatory
molecules, collectively known as senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). SASP mediates many of
the pathophysiological effects of senescence with advancing age in many tissues. Recent data in the brain
suggest that glial cells become senescent during neurodegeneration. This includes microglia, a resident CNS
macrophage. Importantly, ablating all senescent glial cells, including microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte
progenitor cells, is neuroprotective in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-related and tau-dependent
neurodegeneration. However, it is unknown how senescence impacts microglial function and how senescent
microglia then contribute to the disease process. A common feature among neurodegenerative diseases are
reactive, pro-inflammatory microglia with dysfunctional phagocytic function, we will now test the hypothesis that
senescence inhibits normal microglial phagocytic function and promotes a pro-inflammatory cell type, which
accelerates AD-relevant neurodegeneration. We will test this hypothesis using a senescence regulator Smurf2
as a genetic tool. Using cell culture or mice with conditional overexpression of Smurf2, we have the unique
capability to induce senescence specifically in microglia with high temporal resolution in vitro and in vivo. We
also can express a ligase-dead Smurf2 as an elegant control for protein overexpression. Using these tools, we
will investigate whether senescence in microglia affects their ability to phagocyte synapses and amyloid Aβ in
Aim 1. In Aim 2, we will assess how senescence affects microglial homeostasis and transition into a reactive,
pro-inflammatory state. In Aim 3, we will determine the impact of senescent microglia on neurodegenerative
phenotypes in the APP/PS1 model of AD-relevant neurodegeneration and identify whether senolytic treatment
to ablate senescent cells can attenuate or reverse neurodegeneration. These aims are supported by our strong
preliminary data that we can overexpress Smurf2 and induce senescence in microglia in vitro and in vivo .
Further, in vitro senescent microglia exhibit reduced phagocytosis of cellular debris, reminiscent of what is
observed in AD and engulfment of Aβ. Leveraging our unique genetic tool kit and our combined expertise in
microglial biology (Schafer) and senescence mechanisms (Zhang), we are in a strong position to gain
fundamental insight into how cellular senescence affects microglial function and, in turn, the
neurodegenerative process. Long-term, we aim to identify novel, senescence-based therapeutic targets for
AD and other related diseases where aging is a major risk factor."
10984953,"Limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change (LATE-NC) is a common
pathology of aging, associated with an amnestic syndrome mimicking Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The co-
morbid pathologic and genetic risk factors of LATE-NC remain incompletely understood. The goals of this
proposal are to clarify the mechanisms underlying LATE-NC, to determine how these mechanisms interact and
affect subregions of human amygdalae, and to generate a practical classification scheme of LATE-NC that is
necessary to guide future studies. The amygdala is the first brain region affected in LATE-NC and therefore
represents the best anatomic region to understand LATE-NC in its earliest phase(s). A major challenge has
been to reconcile mechanisms underlying TDP-43 proteinopathy in community-based autopsy cohorts of older
adults (which show a spectrum of complex age-related diseases such as LATE-NC, and mixed pathologies),
with results in hospital/clinic-based cohorts that tend to include autopsy patients with less common but “pure”
TDP-43 proteinopathies, such as FTLD-TDP and ALS. Therefore, we will combine results from a high quality
community-based autopsy cohort (U. Kentucky) with an excellent hospital-based cohort (Houston Methodist
Hospital) to analyze common disease-driving mechanisms. The study will incorporate well-characterized
human brains (N>1400 total) of patients with ALS-FTD spectrum disorders, and AD neuropathologic changes
(ADNC), with and without comorbid LATE-NC. We will characterize the comorbid proteinopathies and vascular
pathologies associated with the earliest foci of TDP-43 pathology, including co-localization of TDP-43 and
other misfolded proteins, such as Tau. We hypothesize that the initiation of LATE-NC in human amygdalae
results from a selective cellular vulnerability that varies in association with specific genetic risk factors. We will
examine and contrast the proteomic profiles of susceptible and resistant subregions of human amygdalae, both
within individuals and across disease states (e.g., LATE-NC versus ADNC, LATE-NC versus ALS-FTD
spectrum, including FTLD-TDP cases. We also hypothesize that pathologically and genetically distinct forms of
age-related TDP-43 proteinopathy exist in human brains, including: (a) an ADNC-related subtype influenced by
APOE, (b) a FTLD-related subtype affected by GRN and TMEM106B, and (c) an arteriosclerosis-related
subtype associated with ABCC9 gene variant. We will test methods of disease delineation - areas of overlap
and points of difference - and evaluate how these hypothesized mechanism-classified subtypes synergize or
negate each other when they are comorbid, and how the disease subtypes manifest clinically. The multimodal
data may indicate a practical classification scheme. The two-institution study design enables us to evaluate
inter-rater reliability and to emphasize replicability. Overall, the project will clarify mechanisms contributing to
age-related TDP-43 pathology, and provide an optimized and useful framework to guide future mechanistic
studies, therapeutic development, and biomarker development."
10875779,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, affects 10% of the population
aged 65 and older, and up to 50% of people over 85 years old1,2. Patients with AD suffer from a
decline in episodic memory with inability to recall the recent past and eventual loss of long-term
memories, loss of cognitive function and changes in personality. The major goal of this proposal
is to define pathways for the clearance of amyloid-β (Aβ), whose aggregation into amyloid
plaques is a hallmark of AD. Increasing evidence indicates an important role of astrocytes, the
most abundant cell type among glial cells in the brain, in Aβ clearance. This proposal will focus
on a potentially novel regulatory mechanism for astrocytic Aβ uptake by LRP4 (LDLR-related
protein 4), an LDLR-like protein that is abundantly and specifically expressed in astrocytes. We
and others have demonstrated that LRP4 is critical to the formation of the neuromuscular
junction (NMJ) where it serves as a receptor for agrin, a factor from motoneurons. The agrin-
LRP4 interaction activates the transmembrane tyrosine kinase MuSK to induce AChR clustering
and NMJ formation. Results of our preliminary studies, some of which were published, suggest
that LRP4 may play a role in regulating AD pathogenesis. First, LRP4 was selectively expressed
in astrocytes in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC), both AD-vulnerable regions. Its
level in astrocytes was higher than those of LDLR and LRP1, both of which have been
implicated in Aβ uptake. Second, LRP4 was reduced in postmortem brain tissues of AD patients.
In accord, deleting LRP4 augmented Aβ plaques and AD-associated deficits in 5xFAD mice, an
AD mouse model. Third, Aβ uptake was impaired in LRP4 mutant (mt) astrocytes. These results
suggest a critical role of LRP4 to astrocytic Aβ uptake. What is the underlying mechanism(s) by
which LRP4 regulates Aβ uptake? LRP4 is a single transmembrane protein with a large
extracellular domain (ECD). Interestingly, we found, in addition to agrin, LRP4 can interact with
ApoE, whose ε4 allele (ApoE4) impairs Aβ clearance. Further pilot studies indicate, first that
agrin stimulation could increase Aβ uptake by astrocytes, in a manner dependent on LRP4. LRP4
could interact with agrin, which has been shown to associate with Aβ. Therefore, we posit that
LRP4 serves as a receptor for ApoE- and agrin-mediated Aβ uptake. Second, LRP4 could
interact with the prorenin receptor (PRR), an auxiliary protein of v-ATPase that is critical to
maintaining endolysosomal pH, and is required for its down-regulation. LRP4 deficiency
increased PRR levels and caused hyper-acidification of endolysosomes. Therefore, we postulate
that PRR upregulation may be a mechanism of LRP4 deficiency. Finally, the agrin-LRP4
interaction could stimulate MuSK in astrocytes. We wondered whether MuSK activation is
necessary for agrin-promotion of Aβ uptake. Based on these results and considerations, we
hypothesized that LRP4 is critical to Aβ uptake by astrocytes via multiple mechanisms. In this
proposal, we will determine whether LRP4 deficiency correlates with AD development in AD
patients and expedites AD-like pathology in AD mice; determine whether LRP4 regulates
astrocytic Aβ uptake by interacting with ApoE and PRR; and investigate the roles of the agrin-
LRP4 pathway in Aβ uptake by astrocytes. We hope that the proposed studies will not only
establish novel cellular functions of astrocytic LRP4 in regulating Aβ uptake, but also shed new
light on AD pathogenesis. Such knowledge is prerequisite to the development of new therapeutic
strategies for AD."

The International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) Consortium is applying for funding under the
Hazardous Waste Worker Training (HWWTP), Environmental Worker Training Program
(ECWTP), and the Hazardous Disaster Preparedness Training (HDPTP) cooperative agreements to
provide appropriate model health and safety training. The targeted population for the HWWTP is
workers who are engaged in hazardous waste remediation, hazardous materials transportation,
warehousing, solid waste and recycling, airline, and emergency response. The ECWTP will target
members of disadvantaged and underserved communities to provide them with the life skills and
job training needed to obtain employment and pursue environmental career paths. The HDPTP will
target workers and community members who work and live in disaster prone areas and are likely to
be involved in response and recovery activities.
The long term objectives and specific aims of the IBT Consortium are to increase worker,
community, and environmental safety and resilience by training workers to appropriately respond
to accidental releases of hazardous materials, work safely on hazardous waste remediation projects,
safely transport hazardous materials via truck, rail, or air, and safely respond to natural disasters.
The IBT Consortium will access the nationwide population of targeted workers through
established partnerships with appropriate partners to deliver training to 15,745 workers in the
HWWTP, 730 workers in the ECWTP, and 4,455 workers in the HDPTP, for a total of 20,930
workers trained during the 5-year project period.

to continue delivering model NIEHS-funded training to two worker populations – members and employees
of Native American tribes nationwide and Public Safety Personnel within the southeastern U.S. Both target
populations face significant health and safety risks due to potential exposure to hazards during (1)
emergency response to uncontrolled releases of hazardous materials (hazmats), (2) emergency response
to disasters caused by terrorist attacks, accidental hazmat releases, or severe weather events, and (3) work
assessing and remediating uncontrolled hazardous waste dumps. They also face highly dangerous illicit
drug use and manufacture. All these emergencies represent significant hazards to the health and safety of
the responders and the communities they serve. The 573 federally recognized Native American tribes
include 1.9 million members living in the contiguous 48 states and Alaska on over 50 million acres of land
through which run hundreds of thousands of miles of rivers, roads, and railroad rights-of-way, making
transportation accidents a significant threat. Additionally, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
there are 74,870 firefighters, 53,500 emergency medical technicians and paramedics and 137,740 police
and sheriff’s patrol officers in the southeastern states where the program has been most active: Alabama,
Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Tennessee, North Carolina and South Carolina. AFC will be
joined by Native American Fish and Wildlife Society to promote the proposed training to tribal emergency
response personnel. AFC/WST will use the growing network of contacts developed over its 32-year history
(as WST) as well as the broader AFC’s leadership in North American Fire Training Directors and other
networks of training providers to carry training to public sector responders. This training will include existing
courses in topics such as hazardous materials emergency response, incident command systems, air
monitoring, mass casualty incident triage, confined space rescue, illicit drug response, and responder safety
during natural and man-made disasters. Hazardous materials training will be expanded to Hazmat
Technician level and hazardous waste worker initial and refresher training will be added to the training plan.
The training will be delivered directly by AFC instructors and through secondary training by trainees who
take the training back to their tribes and local agencies. AFC instructors are projected to directly train over
2,565 Native American responders and over 2,805 public sector responders in both programs. In addition,
peer trainers will use AFC materials to train an additional 1,080 of their peers. In total for the five years, AFC
projects to conduct over 360 classes to over 6,450 trainees in 98,600 contact hours through direct and

10816983,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The main goal of the University of Chicago (UChicago) Digestive Diseases Research Core Center (DDRCC)
for Interdisciplinary Study of Inflammatory Intestinal Disorders (C-IID) is to foster and facilitate
interdisciplinary and innovative, patient-oriented, research in the field of complex inflammatory digestive
diseases (DD), to understand and therapeutically exploit discoveries to improve the health of patients with DD.
The UChicago C-IID is now in its 29th year, and, despite being a highly focused research program, has a
multidisciplinary research base, with 46 full and 25 associate member investigators, and a total annual direct
funding for DD that has increased by more than 40% since the last funding cycle, with $21.1 million of direct cost
(not including funding from associate members). The ongoing CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS is that advances in care
of patients with complex inflammatory diseases of the bowel requires a structure that empowers interdisciplinary
clinical and discovery research investigating the mechanisms disrupting intestinal homeostasis and driving
inflammation to identify therapeutic targets and foster translation of basic discoveries to development of new
preventive and curative treatments. Taking-into-account the evolving scientific and technology advances and
trends, and the interests of our members, we have re-aligned members around four C-IID cores that embrace
four major interrelated research themes: Microbiome & Metabolism, Genetics, Genomics & Computation,
Immune & Tissue response, and Translational & Clinical. Our OVERALL SPECIFIC AIMS are to: (i) build a
highly collaborative, multidisciplinary team, (ii) identify and foster young investigators working in DD-related
research, (iii) build a fully integrated translational research infrastructure with state-of-the-art core facilities and
cutting-edge, high quality, and cost-effective services and resources, (iv) support a robust enrichment program, (v)
promote interactions between the C-IID and other UChicago NIDDK centers and existing C-IID (especially with
the Midwest DDRCC alliance). The C-IID has received tremendous institutional support as 1 of 5 priority areas
designated for development by the Biological Sciences Division. The C-IID has successfully supported new
investigators, but also drawn in talented scientists outside of the field of DD (8 now full members since 2015). Over
the past two funding cycles, the P&F program has resulted in over $20.1M in extramural funds, or a 20 to 1 return-
on-investment. Furthermore, 43% of the 322 publications acknowledging the C-IID for its support were coauthored
by two or more C-IID members, indicating a high level of collaborative science. There was a 5-fold increase in the
number of co-authored high impact papers (Impact factor>15) compared to the previous funding cycle. Thus, the
C-IID has successfully met its goals of advancing the science and translation of discovery in inflammatory DD. The
C-IID as a whole is greater than the sum of its parts. It provides strategic vision, cutting-edge, high quality, and
cost-effective services and resources, and gives opportunity to current and next generation scientists to flourish in
a highly collaborative and productive environment."
10875708,"The amyloid-cascade hypothesis states that deposition of extracellular Aβ plaques is the primary event in AD
that facilitates accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau), formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and
drives subsequent neurodegeneration. Microglial activation is the earliest response to pathological
changes in the brain and is known to shape neuronal activity and immune activation of neighboring
glial cells. Thus, how Aβ-driven microglial activation shapes neurodegenerative signaling in AD is a
critical unknown in current therapeutic approaches. Communication between microglia and neurons via
microglial CX3CR1 and its neuronal ligand is a central signaling checkpoint that shapes the immunological
niche in AD. RNA sequencing studies have postulated that downregulation of microglial CX3CR1 is a
neuroprotective response. By contrast, our data suggests that the loss of CX3CR1 increases accumulation of
toxic, soluble Aβ species which correlate with increased synaptic dysfunction, pTau pathology and
neurodegeneration. Indeed, recent reports have associated CX3CR1-V249I, a mutation which impairs
CX3CR1 function, with increased NFT pathology and worsened neurodegeneration in AD patients. This
proposal aims to test the unique hypothesis that downregulation/loss of CX3CR1 signaling alters microglial
activation and results in impaired clearance and/or increased accumulation of neurotoxic soluble Aβ oligomers.
Enrichment of toxic Aβ in the micro-environment triggers a cascade of neurodegenerative signaling including
the generation and spread of neurotoxic species of pTau. Using the single-nuclei sequencing approach we
propose an unbiased genetic screen to assess how CX3CR1 alters neurodegenerative, phagocytic and
neuroinflammatory signaling in early vs. late stages of AD. Results of this broad genetic analysis will be
validated by a deep pathological phenotyping of the disease using 5xFAD and APPPS1 transgenic AD mice
deficient in CX3CR1 signaling (Aim 1). To investigate how a toxic Aβ milieu in the absence of CX3CR1 can
drive neurodegeneration, we will assess the propagation and spread of pathological tau species following
stereotaxic injection of toxic tau from post-mortem AD tissue into the brains of 5xFAD mice with and without
CX3CR1 (Aim 2). Lastly, to understand how the human V249I variant affects neurodegenerative responses,
we will use CRISPER-Cas9 technology to generate human iPSC derived microglia with CX3CR1 harboring the
V429I (loss-of-function) mutation and isogenic iPS-derived AD neurons expressing M146L and L286V
mutations in the PSEN1 gene. Co-culture of human-derived microglia with isogenic AD neurons will be used to
assess a) how the V249I mutation shapes Aβ driven neurotoxic microglial activation and b) how Aβ-activated
V249I+ microglia alter neuronal activity and affect neurodegenerative signalling/pathology (Aim 3). Combining
the use of transgenic AD mouse models and human iPSC based in-vitro assays, this proposal will shed light on
the overarching effects of CX3CR1 on Aβ-driven neurodegeneration in the cascade of AD pathogenesis."

As a 501 (c)(3) not-for-profit institution created for the sole purpose of improving working conditions in the U.S.
construction industry, CPWR's mission aligns with the goals of the NIEHS Worker Training Program (WTP).
CPWR's purpose as an organization, as stated in its Articles of Incorporation are; “to encourage the elimination
or reduction of conditions constituting hazards to the health or safety of workers, and to promote the
maintenance and improvement of safe and healthy working conditions for workers.”
Beyond these broad, long-term objectives of CPWR as an organization, the specific aims of this proposed
training program are: 1) to train 5,820 students/workers in 398 courses in the first year with a total of 29,100
students in 1,945 courses over the five year period, and to continue instructor development through annual
Train-the-Trainer programs and Instructor Enhancements (HWWTP); 2) to train 138 minority and other
underrepresented students in 63 courses in the first year with a total of 690 students in 315 courses over a five
year period in five cities (New Orleans, LA; St. Paul, MN; Flint, MI; Boston, MA; and East Palo Alto, CA) and
place at least 80% in construction union apprenticeship training programs for jobs in the construction and
environmental remediation industries (EWCTP); 3) to directly train 1,374 additional Outreach Instructors in 86
courses in the disaster program in the first year with a total of 6,870 Instructors in 430 courses over a five year
period, while partially supporting more than 3,700 additional Outreach Instructors, and to continue to work with
NIEHS, other grantees, and OSHA in moving the training forward as part of our collective efforts to increase
preparedness in the U.S. construction industry to respond to large scale natural and man-made disasters
(HDPTP); and 4) continue rigorous evaluation over the five year period to continuously assess training
effectiveness of all three programs.
To achieve these aims, CPWR submits this application in coordination and cooperation with community-based
organizations in our targeted ECWTP cities and with a training consortium of 12 international/national building
trades unions representing workers engaged in hazardous waste work at designated 1910.120 sites around
the country, emergency response whether it be natural or man-made, and in other environmentally hazardous
work assignments. Our proposed program is therefore national in scope, with our building trades union
training consortium representing more than 3 million construction workers geographically dispersed throughout
every state in the country.
CPWR's building trades union training consortium is diverse, with each of our 12 partnering unions
representing workers that apply different skills necessary on environment remediation sites. Typical of the
cyclical, transient nature of the industry and its workforce, our target population of workers move on and off
environmental remediation sites, often moving from one employer to another. The HWWTP proposal in this
application describes in detail the types of jobs workers represented by each of our 12 consortium partners
perform on designated 1910.120 sites. Whether they work on these sites for years, months, weeks, or just a
few days, with the support of this proposed program CPWR and its 12 consortium partners aim to assure these
workers are adequately trained to protect themselves, their co-workers, and their environment."
10875695,"Project Summary
The brain communicates with the gastrointestinal tract via the well-established gut-brain axis. Due to an
increase in the permeability of blood brain barrier and intestinal epithelial barrier during aging, the brain likely
becomes more susceptible to inflammation initiated in the gut. Both chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD
including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) and Alzheimer's disorder (AD) increase in prevalence among
the elderly. However, the role of this intestinal inflammation on AD progression remains unclear. We observed
a significant increase in intestinal inflammation and dysfunction during disease in a mouse model of AD. Based
upon this data we hypothesize that AD includes intestinal dysfunction as a largely unrecognized component of
disease. Moreover, we expect that chronic conditions such as IBD may potentiate progression of AD through
inflammatory changes propagated from the intestines to the brain. We will elaborate the link between the
intestines and the brain in AD using a transgenic mouse model of AD, AppNL-G-F mice. Our hypothesis will be
tested by completing three aims. Aim one will use clinically available intestine-selective T cell inhibitory
antibodies to attenuate basal AD intestinal inflammation and colitis-induced exacerbation in AppNL-G-F mice and
confirm that intestinal dysfunction contributes to memory deficits in these mice. Aim two will assess the efficacy
of the gut-selective inhibitory antibody therapy to decrease brain Aβ levels, gliosis, synaptic loss, and cytokine
levels. The final aim will cross the AppNL-G-F mice to Ltatm1Dch mice that carry a null mutation in lymphotoxin α
resulting in absence of Peyer's patches and lymph nodes. This genetic approach will provide additional
confirmation that intestinal inflammatory changes in the AppNL-G-F mice are required for the memory dysfunction
and brain related changes. Completion of the study will verify a critical role of gut inflammation in disease
progression and validate a clinically available therapeutic option, anti-α4β7 antibodies, as treatments targeting
the gut-brain axis. This suggests that select immunomodulatory agents can be repositioned to combat the
inflammatory component of AD without the need for crossing the blood brain barrier."

following goals: Aim 1. To strengthen a transformational alliance between UIC, NEIU, and the NU-LCC in pursuit
of cancer health equity in Chicago; Aim 2. To initiate, conduct, and support innovative bench, translational,
clinical, and prevention and control focused cancer research, with emphasis on cancer health disparities; Aim
3. To develop and implement cancer-related education and outreach activities generated with the engagement
of underserved communities across Chicago; Aim 4. To coordinate research education and mentoring
opportunities to recruit, retain, and advance a pipeline of underrepresented students in cancer research careers
and to develop early career faculty who will forge independent cancer research careers; and Aim 5. To conduct
ongoing rigorous evaluation of ChicagoCHEC activities. These goals are accomplished by a nurturing hub of
four Cores (Administrative, Planning and Evaluation, Research Education, and Outreach) and a research project
funding program. Since the launch of ChicagoCHEC in 2015, there has been rapid growth in collaborative
infrastructure built across the three partnering institutions; enhanced cancer research engagement, capacity,
and education; extensive community outreach and engagement; and encouraging advancement of
ChicagoCHEC faculty and students. ChicagoCHEC projects and programs provided research experiences to
155 students, provided cancer research and leadership opportunities for 57 faculty (21 have been
promoted/received tenure), and directly resulted in 94 peer-reviewed publications, 47 extramural grants
submitted, and 24 grants awarded. ChicagoCHEC will leverage the momentum forged by the initial U54 award
to drive innovative cancer research, research education, and community outreach and engagement that cuts
across disciplinary and institutional boundaries. ChicagoCHEC will leverage its diverse team of faculty, students,
and partners, connectivity to Chicago’s underserved communities, and guidance of internal and external advisory
bodies. The next chapter will include two initial full cancer research projects and two initial pilot projects,
continued support from four tri-institutional ChicagoCHEC Cores, and strong institutional commitment."
11123530,"Project Summary (Abstract)
 Opioid use disorder (OUD) prevalence and morbidity rates have reached unprecedented levels among
adolescents and emerging adults. Recovery support services (RSS) for persons with SUDs typically focus on
the individual client after acute care. But for youth with SUDs, developmental theory underscores the primacy
of family-level risk and protective factors, and family-based interventions have the strongest empirical support.
Yet there is an alarming paucity of research, clinical resources, and generalizable metrics focused on family-
based RSS for youth with OUD. Family Recovery Research Institute (FaRRI) will be a sustainable research
network designed to develop and evaluate innovative family-based RSS across the youth OUD services
cascade. FaRRI will conduct research on promoting family integration in youth OUD services with the goals of
increasing service engagement and engendering supportive family environments for youth recovery. It will
launch with two specific foci: (1) Innovations in family RSS interventions and metrics to assist youth OUD
providers with integrating families in OUD services. It will focus on training and evaluation aimed at multiple
levels: behavior specialists, physicians, support staff, and organization. For the current project we will develop
a modular protocol (assertive family outreach, family session management skills, OUD psychoeducation and
decision-making) to train providers in enlisting family resources to fortify their efforts to deliver medication-
assisted treatment, promote treatment adherence, and broker supportive services; and a companion measure
of youth and family integration in OUD services. (2) Innovations in measurement of direct-to-family RSS for
families of youth with OUD. The current project will enhance existing remote-access RSS for caregivers of
youth with SUDs (helpline, parent coaching, mobile messaging) by developing multidimensional metrics for
family service engagement and outcomes. This proposed 5-year project would leverage the expertise of a
multi-stakeholder advisory board to establish FaRRI network infrastructure and sustainability pathways for
advancing family-based RSS research for youth OUD (Aim 1), generating new provider resources and metrics
for family integration in youth OUD care (Aim 2), and generating new metrics for remote-access family-focused
OUD recovery resources (Aim 3). At project end FaRRI will maintain a sustainable network of family-based
RSS research activities, provider training and measurement resources, and mentoring; resources would be
available to providers and families directly from FaRRI or as white-label products replicated by other RSS
providers. Feasibility of achieving study aims is bolstered by study team expertise in research on family-based
clinical and digital interventions to support youth OUD recovery; and a national advisory board of scientists,
organizations that train youth OUD providers, government regulators of youth OUD services, behavioral health
payors and marketers, and youth and families affected by OUD. FaRRI infrastructure will be buttressed by
mentoring opportunities for junior-level providers and researchers working on FaRRI research goals."
10828797,"CENTER OVERVIEW: PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of the Center for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (CSIBD) is to promote and facilitate
digestive disease research that yields insight into IBD pathogenesis and leads to therapeutic advancements.
This objective remains unchanged since the inception of the CSIBD in 1991, guiding the Center through nearly
three decades of discovery in genetic underpinnings of IBD risk and protection, mechanisms of epithelial and
immune function, and contributions to etiology from the gut microbiome. The CSIBD is home to 89 members
that received over $44 million in digestive disease research funding. CSIBD research is driven by a central
hypothesis that the major forms of IBD result from interactions between genetically-determined and permissive
features of the individual, gut microbiome, and other environmental factors that dysregulate intestinal immune
and inflammatory pathways. Investigations are broadly divided into six areas: human genetics and physiological
mechanisms; the gut microbiome in health and disease; cell circuits and systems biology; innate and adaptive
immunity; chemical biology and therapeutic science; and clinical translational science and patient impact.
Collaborations within the CSIBD generated a single-cell atlas of the human colon during ulcerative colitis (UC)
that revealed new inflammatory populations associated with disease and anti-TNF therapy resistance, pinpointed
cell types in which UC susceptibility genes function, and established a framework for elucidating mechanisms of
inflammation and treatment response. Incorporating longitudinal microbiome metagenomic, metatranscriptomic,
and metabolomic profiles with host molecular measurements, the Integrative Human Microbiome Project
catalogued host–microbe relationships in IBD and laid a foundation for the next phase in clinical translation of
the gut microbiome. The overall specific aims of the CSIBD are to (1) promote research in basic science areas
relevant to better understanding of epithelial biology and mucosal immune function in IBD; (2) advance our
understanding of gut pathophysiology by examining the gut as a circuit, studying the core components of gut
intra- and inter-cellular interactions that determine health and disease; (3) promote the study of the pathogenesis
of IBD; (4) promote interactions among scientists exploring diverse fields that share relevance to IBD; (5) promote
translational IBD research; (6) attract investigators to the study of IBD and mucosal immunology; and (7) provide
an environment and mechanism to foster development of young investigators focused on IBD. A central priority
of the CSIBD is to serve as a nexus of fundamental science, clinical translation, and patient benefit by enabling
collaborations across biomedical disciplines and catalyzing advancements that address critical barriers to
building a more detailed understanding of IBD and its causes. Four biomedical cores offer state-of-the-art
resources and expertise from leaders in (1) Human Genetics and Microbiome, (2) Cell Circuits and Immunology,
(3) Cellular and In Vivo Models, and (4) Clinical research. The Pilot and Feasibility and Enrichment Programs
attract new members to the IBD community and encourage interactions between investigators."
10875698,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Tau neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) deposits are a characteristic hallmark of Alzheimer's disease and their
appearance correlates closely with cognitive decline and disease progression. Mutations in tau cause
frontotemporal dementia, establishing a critical role for tau in the etiology of neurodegeneration and dementia.
In Alzheimer's disease, tau becomes hyperphosphorylated, likely leading to its release from microtubules and
thereby facilitating its subsequent assembly into pathological aggregates. Other tau post-translational
modifications (PTMs) such as acetylation are also implicated in disrupting tau-microtubule interactions and
promoting tau aggregation. However, considerable evidence suggests that mature tau fibrils found in NFTs are
not the species that cause neuronal death, and instead that oligomeric intermediates formed during the
conversion of tau from a monomer to a highly ordered fibril are the toxic species. While recent breakthroughs
have provided high-resolution structures of brain-derived tau aggregates, the structures of tau oligomers
remain largely unknown. In aim 1 of this proposal, we will determine the structure of a novel membrane-
induced toxic tau oligomer that we recently discovered using a combination of cutting edge solid-state NMR
and ESR spectroscopy. By generating the first detailed structure picture of any toxic tau oligomeric species, we
will advance our understanding of the interactions that stabilize tau oligomers and make possible structure
function studies of their formation and their toxicity.
 The details of how PTMs influence tau interactions with microtubules or other interaction partners remain
poorly understood. Recently, our collaborators discovered a novel tau PTM, lysine-succinylation, which occurs
specifically in Alzheimer's brains but not in control brains and promotes tau aggregation, suggesting that it may
contribute to disease development. In aim 2 of this proposal, we will determine the effects of this novel PTM
on the functional interactions of tau with microtubules, as well as with unassembled tubulin and cell
membranes. We will compare these effects to those of lysine-acetylation, which has been shown to be a key
mediator of tau function and toxicity. We will employ a combination of direct and saturation transfer NMR
methods using tau peptides, tau fragments and full-length tau isoforms. Our in vitro measurements will be
correlated with and will inform studies on how these PTMs affect tau interactions in model cells and cultured
neurons. The results may provide alternative functional tau targets for disease intervention, important given
the challenges associated with targeting amyloid aggregates and aggregation cascades. In addition to
perturbing functional interactions of tau, PTMs may also directly influence the formation and structure of tau
aggregates. In aim 3 of this proposal, we will investigate the effects of lysine-succinylation and acetylation on
membrane-induced tau oligomer formation, structure and toxicity. Given the potential role of existing and novel
tau PTMs in disease, this information may be useful for the development of novel tau-targeted therapeutics."

ABSTRACT
Several reports using animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggest that amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau
aggregates can spread across different tissues promoting the appearance of the typical brain lesions observed
in this disease. The role of blood and peripheral clearance in the spread of these structures has not been
extensively explored. Our preliminary results show that biologically active Aβ oligomeric seeds are present in
blood of AD patients and animal models, suggesting that this biological fluid may play an important role in the
spreading of the disease. Supporting this data, administration of Aβ aggregates by intra-venous injection
accelerates brain amyloidosis in transgenic mice and removal of circulating Aβ aggregates by whole blood
exchange dramatically reduces the amount of cerebral amyloid deposits. Our working hypothesis is that blood
contributes to the spread of biologically active Aβ oligomeric seeds and that impairment in peripheral clearance
mechanisms has significant implications for the etiology and progression of AD. We also propose that the
presence of functional Aβ oligomers in blood may enable the development of novel strategies for diagnosis and
therapy focusing on the peripheral pool of Aβ aggregates. To test this hypothesis we plan to identify and
characterize biologically functional Aβ aggregates in blood of AD patients, using novel in vitro techniques and
animal models. Also, we will explore whether abnormalities on peripheral Aβ clearance by acute or chronic liver
damage affects the progression of amyloid deposition in models of familial and sporadic AD. Moreover, we will
study the translational implication of these findings by attempting to develop novel strategies for diagnosis and
treatment based on the idea that misfolded Aβ aggregates are present in blood and contribute to the pathology
in the brain. In the diagnostic side, we propose to adapt to Aβ an assay for ultra-sensitive detection of protein
aggregates in blood. This assay, termed PMCA, was originally developed in our lab to detect prions and has
been widely utilized to identify pathological prions in blood of patients. In the therapeutic side, we propose to
perform proof-of-concept studies to analyze the benefit of removing Aβ aggregates from the blood for the
pathological and functional abnormalities in the brain. Removal of circulating Aβ aggregates in live animals will
be done by plasmapheresis and blood dialysis. The experiments proposed in this project will enable to investigate
a possible mechanism for the initiation and progression of what is widely considered as the earliest pathological
alteration in AD, i.e. the misfolding, aggregation and cerebral accumulation of Aβ."
10884920,"ABSTRACT (OVERALL)
The overarching goal of the UAB-Childhood Cystic Kidney Disease Core Center (UAB-CCKDCC) is to work in
partnership with the PKD Consortium, under the direction of the U24 Central Coordinating Site (U24-CCS) and
NIDDK, to eliminate obstacles in cystic kidney disease related research that are hindering progress toward
the development of improved and innovative treatment strategies for cystic kidney disorders. To accomplish this
goal, the UAB-CCKDCC has assembled a multidisciplinary team of researchers and clinicians who will
direct four tightly integrated resource and service-oriented Cores along with an Administrative Core. The
collective mission of these Cores is to support, accelerate, and expand basic and translational research activities
being performed by PKD Consortium members. The Center will focus on the development of resources to
analyze cilio-cystic disease protein function, localization, and interactions and how defects in these functions
contribute to the pathogenic mechanisms involved in cyst initiation and progression. The Center will complete its
mission through providing ready access to clinical data and biomaterial from CCKD patients, through
the development and distribution of patient-relevant cell and animal models of CCKD, and through the
development of methodology to utilize these models to ascertain the efficacy of candidate therapies to slow
disease progression using a standardized, cost-effective, and longitudinal imaging and analysis strategies. The
services and resources being made available by the Center along with the integration between each of the
Cores will expand research activities well beyond that capable in most individual laboratories and will accelerate
the pace of research into causes and possible cures of cystic kidney diseases by providing for high quality,
robust, and reproducible outcomes needed to prioritize drugs for future clinical trials."
10611809,"Connecting TDP-43 Pathobiology to the Molecular Profiles of TDP-43 Driven Common Dementias
In previous collaborative work[1], Dr. Phatnani and Dr. Gale-Hammell used a large ALS patient sequencing consortium to uncover the predominant molecular pathways that are altered in the frontal and motor cortex of patients with this TDP-43 associated disease. In this work, ALS cortex samples could be differentiated into 3 distinct groups based upon whether their transcriptional profiles showed hallmarks of: oxidative stress, retrotransposon de-silencing, or neuroinflammation. Histological staining of tissues from these same patients showed tight links between TDP-43 proteinopathy and the latter two groups of patients, though TDP-43 protein aggregates were most predominant in the retrotransposon expressing subset. This grant will build on our prior work to address whether similar TDP-43 dependent pathomechanisms are involved in common dementias associated with TDP-43 dysfunction, specifically frontotemporal dementia with TDP-43 proteinopathy (FTD-TDP) and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Our hypothesis is that retrotransposons contribute in part to the toxicity associated with TDP-43 dysfunction in FTD-TDP and AD, which we will conclusively test in this proposal. We have amassed a large collection of tissue samples from over 200 patients with either FTD-TDP or AD, and with extensive clincopathological characterization. The profiles from these samples will be used to guide deep mechanistic studies into the pathomechanisms of TDP-43 in FTD and AD. 
 
 Aim 1: How does the cell- and tissue-specific context of TDP-43 proteinopathy affect its impact in FTD and AD? We will use multiplexed immunostaining data of postmortem cortical tissue from 200 FTLD-TDP and AD patients selected to show signatures of TDP-43 pathology, and in age-matched sudden death controls. We will obtain high spatial resolution IHC images of multiple independent factors, including pathological markers (pTDP43 and pTau), markers of cell type, and components of pathways identified to be coincident with TDP-43 dysfunction in our previous work such as inflammatory markers (IBA1, TREM2) and retrotransposon proteins (HERVK-env and L1HS-orf1). At adjacent slices from the same tissue, we will use Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) to define a high-resolution transcriptomic atlas of cell-type specific and context-specific impacts of TDP-43 proteinopathy. These combined molecular profiles will allow us to directly assess the contribution of TDP-43 dysfunction to cell-type specific and proteinopathy-proximal effects.
 
Aim 2: Do active retrotransposons simply report on TDP-43 dysfunction or contribute to cellular toxicity in FTD and AD? We will obtain long read PacBio sequencing of individual expressed retrotransposons in FTD-TDP and AD patient samples to robustly determine the specific expressed genomic retrotransposon loci in both dementias, and their relative ability to produce functional proteins. We will then use CRISPRa to activate individual retrotransposons identified above in iPS differentiated cortical neurons to test for relative cellular toxicity. In the converse experiment, we will use CRISPRi to inhibit the activity of individual retrotransposons identified above in iPS neurons with TDP-43 dysfunction to test for the relative ability to alleviate TDP-43 mediated neurotoxicity.
 
Aim 3: Can TDP-43 dependent retrotransposons contribute to activation of astrocytes and microglia? In the NYGC ALS Consortium patients, we previously saw activation of innate immune signaling pathways in samples with evidence of TDP-43 proteinopathy and activated microglia.  Moreover, retrotransposons have previously been shown to activate innate immune pathways in other contexts. This aim will establish whether TDP-43 dependent retrotransposons are sufficient to induce activation of adjacent glial cells in cellular models of FTD-TDP and AD. We will express individual retrotransposons in iPS derived cortical neurons and test for the activation of adjacent astrocytes and microglia in a 3D organoid co-culture system. In the converse experiment, we will express TDP-43 dependent retrotransposons in glial cell types, to test whether retrotransposons more potently activate innate immune signaling pathways in astrocytes and microglia, which subsequently secrete neurotoxic factors."
10850856,"The National Partnership for Environmental Technology Education, ME, in partnership
with the Hazardous Materials Training and Research Institute, IA, submits this proposal on
behalf of the Community College Consortium for Health and Safety Training (CCCHST) to
provide memorable, cost-effective training for hazardous materials and waste workers engaged
in waste treatment, storage and disposal, hazardous waste generation, clean up and remedial
action, emergency response and hazardous materials transportation. CCCHST membership
consists of community and tribal colleges partnered with business and industry, universities,
and community-based organizations offering a consistent and quality response to the national
training need for hazardous waste workers and emergency response personnel.
 The goal of CCCHST is to make NIEHS-approved worker training nationally available
through over 100 CCCHST organizations, whose instructors are prepared through a Train-the-
Trainer model program, offering hazardous materials instruction in nearly all states of the
nation. CCCHST instructors, prepared and supported by PETE and HMTRI, will annually train
a minimum 50,000 students, workers, and supervisors to protect themselves and their
communities from exposure to hazardous materials encountered during hazardous waste site
cleanup, Brownfields redevelopment, transportation of hazardous materials, and response to
spills and releases of hazardous materials, offering a minimum 3,000 courses each year. PETE
has two additional missions beyond this its core Train-the-Trainer model program.
(1) Military Haz Mat Worker Training. PETE will offer a direct worker training program
for Total Military Family (TMF) personnel, including veterans, military personnel and their
families transitioning to the public sector. Annually, 200 TMF members from Fort Riley (KS),
Fort Sill (OK), Fort Carson (CO), the Norfolk Naval Station (VA), and future expansion to the
Portsmouth Naval Shipyard (ME) and to West coast bases, will participate in one-week training
programs, leading to the HazWoper card and a variety of OSHA certifications based on need.
 (2) PETE’s Disaster Preparedness Instructor Institute will annually prepare 20
CCCHST and partner trainers, including those from other NIEHS-awardees, who serve a wide
variety of students and responders. These trainers will return to their communities to annually
prepare an additional 1,500 responders in the Gulf, U.S. Territories, Tribal Nations, programs
serving CERT and Americorps students, and responders throughout the U.S."
10609968,"Cognitive impairments, including memory loss, are prevalent in the elderly and patients with neurodegenerative
disease. However, the exact causes of aging-related cognitive impairments are uncertain, and effective
prevention and treatment options are limited. Increasing evidence implicates astrocytic-neuronal interactions in
a wide range of normal and pathophysiological processes, including memory loss and neurodegeneration.
However, the exact mechanisms by which astrocytes may contribute to disease-related cognitive impairments
are not known. Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) is associated with diverse aging-
related neurodegenerative disorders and its dysfunction correlates with cognitive decline in humans. Recent
studies suggest that glial TDP-43 plays important roles in the brain and its dysfunction might contribute to disease
pathogenesis. In support, mutant TDP-43 can cause cell-autonomous impairments in isolated astrocytes and its
astrocytic expression in animal models causes behavioral deficits and premature mortality, suggesting that
astrocytic TDP-43 is essential for brain function and its dysregulation can cause disease. Despite these intriguing
findings, the roles of astrocytic TDP-43 in cognitive decline and astrocytic-neuronal interactions are not known.
Our preliminary studies suggest that astrocytic TDP-43 dysregulation occurs in human cases with Alzheimer’s
disease and causes memory loss in transgenic mouse models. In addition, our results implicate astrocytic TDP-
43 in regulating glial and neuronal gene expression, astrocytic-neuronal interactions, and neuronal plasticity.
However, these effects and causal links between astrocytic TDP-43 dysregulation and neuronal activities linked
to memory require further investigation. Here, we will investigate how astrocytic TDP-43 dysfunction affects the
brain in common dementias by defining its roles in hippocampus-dependent memory (Aim 1), gene expression,
neuronal activities (Aim 2), and astrocytic-neuronal signaling mechanisms (Aim 3). In these studies, we will test
novel hypotheses that astrocytic TDP-43 dysregulation alters astrocytic-neuronal chemokine signaling and
specific aspects of glutamatergic transmission and neural plasticity. We will use a combination of advanced
molecular and cellular approaches in transgenic mice and cell cultures to target and probe specific cell
populations and brain regions. These studies are poised to reveal novel TDP-43-linked mechanistic cascades,
advance our understanding of how astrocytic-neuronal interactions contribute to cognitive decline, and identify
novel therapeutic strategies that reduce TDP-43-linked deficits in diverse disorders."
10875730,"Geroscience hypothesis posits that aging itself is the underlying major risk factor for 
 age-related chronic diseases, including Alzheimer's Disease (AD); therefore, delaying 
aging delays disease, including AD. This proposal will examine the reciprocal relationship 
between circadian rhythm disruption (CRD) and AD pathology. Circadian rhythms, which are 
intimately interlinked with cellular metabolism, orchestrate the coordinated expression 
and function of multiple pathways that support normal cellular function and repair in both neural 
and peripheral tissues. Circadian rhythms deteriorate with aging, and Alzheimer's patients show 
disrupted circadian rhythm. However, the causal role of CRD for AD is not clear. The proposal will 
assess the relationship between circadian rhythm disruption and AD pathology, will test whether 
improvement in circadian rhythms delay the onset and progression of AD. and will attempt to 
identify underlying molecular mechanisms.
Well-characterized Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) models of AD with Drosophila genetic tools 
will be used to test the impact of genetic or environmental CRD on the onset and severity of the 
multiorgan functional decline in AD. One feature of CRD is the lack of feeding consolidation to 
daylight hours in diurnal animals. To restore aspects of circadian rhythm in older flies, animals 
will be subject to time-restricted feeding (TRF) in which food is provided to flies only during the 
12 h day time. TRF does not reduce daily caloric intake and imparts a molecular signature that is 
distinct from that under caloric restriction. Disease onset and severity will be assessed in TRF, 
and ad lib fed (ALF) flies to determine if TRF is an effective behavioral intervention for AD. To 
test the molecular pathways mediating the opposite effects of CRD and TRF on AD pathologies, 
time-series transcriptomes from these flies will be analyzed to find candidate pathways. The 
functional significance of these pathways will be tested by expressing genetic gain of function and 
loss of function alleles in AD flies. Our novel in vivo genetic-transgenic Drosophila disease 
model coupled with ultrastructural, functional, metabolic, and transcriptome techniques will 
generate unbiased insights into the mechanistic basis of accelerated aging in production of AD. 
Successful completion of this project will provide a deeper molecular understanding of the 
interaction between circadian rhythm and genetic risk of AD. Additionally, this research 
will assess the efficacy of a behavioral intervention that would have a high potential for 
adoption in humans."
10070308,"BACKGROUND: In 2017, the age-adjusted suicide rate for female Veterans was 2.2 times that of female non-
Veterans. This may relate to a substantial increase in the proportion of female Veterans using firearms as their
means of death, particularly among women using Veterans Health Administration (VHA) care. Firearms are now
the leading means of suicide among female Veterans. Lethal means safety (LMS; i.e., reducing access to lethal
means when suicide risk is elevated) is a highly-recommended suicide prevention strategy. Yet prior firearm
LMS research has primarily focused on male Veterans, despite female Veterans idiographically differing in their
firearm access, ownership, and use. Data suggest that female Veterans more often obtain firearms and store
them loaded and nearby to increase safety following interpersonal violence (e.g., sexual assault, intimate partner
violence). Given high rates of interpersonal violence among female Veterans, it is critical to ensure firearm LMS
efforts are tailored and delivered to female Veterans from a trauma-focused lens. Further, nearly 40% of female
Veterans report having household firearms that they do not personally own, which often occurs through spouses
or partners. Thus, including family members in firearm LMS efforts may be particularly important for female
Veterans. Prior research also suggests that Veterans rarely initiate firearm discussions with their VHA providers,
who seldomly assess firearm access, despite its association with suicide risk. Thus, a multi-systemic perspective
that encompasses the perspectives of female Veterans, their spouses or partners, and VHA providers is
essential. SIGNIFICANCE/IMPACT: Effective suicide prevention necessitates a well-informed, patient-centered
approach. Yet firearm knowledge specific to female Veterans remains limited and has largely relied upon
extrapolating data from male Veterans. By understanding the experiences and perspectives of female Veterans,
their spouses/partners, and VHA providers, findings will inform development of gender-sensitive conceptual
understanding and interventions for approaching firearm LMS in this population. Findings can be used to
delineate a tailored firearm LMS intervention for female Veterans that can subsequently be piloted for
acceptability, feasibility, and ultimately efficacy. INNOVATION: This study is innovative in its focus on
understanding the inherent needs and preferences of female Veterans, rather than extrapolating findings from
male Veterans. It will be the first to interview female Veterans, spouses and partners, and VHA providers
regarding experiences and preferences for firearm LMS. This is highly innovative as spouses and partners have
rarely been included in Veteran suicide prevention research, despite increasing the likelihood of female Veterans’
firearm access. Findings are expected to result in knowledge essential for developing a gender-specific
conceptualization and intervention for addressing firearm LMS with female Veterans to ultimately provide a
patient-centered approach to a high-priority, understudied problem. SPECIFIC AIMS: Our aims are to: (1)
Describe female Veterans’ experiences, perspectives, and preferences regarding firearm access and LMS, and
explore the role of interpersonal violence within this; (2) Explore the perspectives and experiences of female
Veterans’ partners and spouses regarding engaging in firearm LMS (e.g., ability, willingness); and (3) Describe
VHA mental health (MH) and primary care (PC) providers’ experiences and perspectives on discussing firearm
access and LMS with female Veterans, including challenges and facilitators. METHODOLOGY: Qualitative
interviews will be conducted with: female Veterans who own firearm(s) or reside in a household with firearm(s)
and have experienced suicidal ideation or attempt (Aim 1); partners and spouses of female Veterans (Aim 2);
and VHA MH and PC providers who work with female Veterans (Aim 3). IMPLEMENTATION/NEXT STEPS:
Results will be synthesized to develop a patient-centered, gender-sensitive firearm LMS intervention for female
Veterans, and resources for family members and VHA providers. Key operations partners will be engaged in this
process to ensure feasible recommendations and wide dissemination of findings."

well as how training can more effectively influence workplace safety culture. The Center adheres to the principles identified in
the NIEHS Minimum Criteria Document. Training provided by the Center is aligned with several sections of the NIEHS
Strategic Plan. The Center proposes to continue training through the HWWTP, HDPTP, and ECWTP programs.
The HWWTP provides core hazardous waste and emergency response training. The training provides critical knowledge and
skills for those requiring training under 29CFR1910.120 and other occupational safety and health standards. Over the next
five years, the Center proposes to train 35,150 workers in 1,960 courses in the HWWTP.
The HDPTP enhances the safety and health of current hazardous materials workers and chemical responders by delivering
training to workers and volunteers responding to disasters. The courses focus on prevention and preparedness so that disaster
response personnel are aware of safety and health hazards and mitigation techniques before they initiate a disaster response.
The Center proposes to add the Migrant Clinicians Network to the HDPTP to extend our reach in Puerto Rico. Additionally,
a new focus on developing trainers who live in the US Virgin Islands will be initiated. Over the next five years, the Center
proposes to train 9,060 workers in 1,120 courses in the HDPTP.
The ECWTP provides training to unemployed and underemployed individuals. The program creates career paths in
environmental health, allowing trainees to achieve sustainable employment. The program targets minority communities with
high unemployment and high poverty rates in low-income areas in New York City and New Jersey. The Center proposes to
add Make the Road New York to the ECWTP to increase the employment opportunities for disadvantaged immigrants. Over
the next five years, the Center proposes to train 475 workers in 290 courses in the ECWTP."

collaborative science by streamlining SOPs for sharing high quality reagents and expertise, by integrating our
the core’s activities and by coordinating collaboration with other RTCCs within the PKD Research Consortium.
The Center’s Specific Aims are: 1) To provide critical state of the art reagents and expertise to a national group
of PKD investigators 2) To provide critical state of the art reagents and expertise to non-PKD investigators in
order to remove barriers to PKD related research 3) To develop innovative reagents and resources that will
advance biomedical discoveries in the field of PKD 4) To drive collaboration between MPKD-RTCC Cores and
other RTCCs within the PKD Research Consortium and 5) To partner with other RTCCs, the consortium
steering committee including the NIDDK to achieve the overall goals of the PKD Research Consortium.
Through expanded interdisciplinary collaborations, we hope to catalyze the translation of biomedical

Eliminating disparities in maternal health outcomes is a national priority, especially given the numerous adverse
health sequelae. Moreover, pregnancy may be an underappreciated period of susceptibility to environmental
exposures and impacts on later maternal health outcomes. Given the lack of data on the relationships between
prenatal exposures and stressors with postpartum maternal health, we will focus the renewal cycle for the
Maternal And Developmental Risks from Environmental and Social Stressors (MADRES) Center on two maternal
health outcomes of utmost concern: maternal depression and cardiovascular health in the years after childbirth.
Depression is the leading cause of mental health-related morbidity worldwide, affecting approximately 300 million
people and is nearly twice as prevalent among women than men. US Hispanic women, have unique risk factors
relative to non-Hispanic women including overcoming stress associated with acculturation and under-utilization
of mental health care services. In parallel, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the number one cause of
mortality and the prevalence of CVD has continued to climb among US women despite greater awareness and
prevention efforts. Cardiovascular conditions that arise during the prenatal period, such as preeclampsia and
hypertension, may have persistent effects into the postpartum period and predict elevated risk of later life CVD.
Despite this growing evidence, there is little to no research on whether exposure to environmental and social
stressors during this vulnerable period may promote cardiovascular dysfunction or maternal depression years
later. This is particularly important in California, where the burden of exposures is not evenly distributed, with
Hispanic and African-American populations carrying the greatest burden of environmental exposures.
Understanding risk factors for maternal depression and CVD among health disparity populations in the
first 4 years postpartum is necessary to reduce the disproportionate burden of disease borne by these
individuals. The MADRES Center will examine whether prenatal environmental exposures and social stressors
lead to higher depression and/or cardiovascular risk factors postpartum and whether patterns in exposure
disparities from the built environment and physical, chemical or social stressors at the residential and
neighborhood level relate to individual-level characteristics including allostatic load. The MADRES Center
combines three innovative research projects, a strong Community Engagement and Dissemination Core, a
comprehensive Investigator Development Core, and a synergizing Administrative Core. The MADRES Center
brings together clinical, environmental, social and public health scientists and community engagement
professionals to create a world-class research program in environmental health disparities. Our collaborative,
multi-disciplinary approach will address key gaps needed for timely and effective disease prevention strategies
and recommendations for approaches to reduce maternal morbidity in the years following childbirth."
10839888,"OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY
In the 4.5 years since our initial award, we have established CHERISH (Center for Health Economics of
Treatment Interventions for Substance Use Disorder, HCV, and HIV) as a National Center of Excellence for
health economic research related to substance use disorder policy and HCV and HIV care of people who use
substances. Our unique multi-institutional center leverages outstanding researchers with synergistic areas of
expertise. In the initial award period, our aims have focused on addressing the needs of integrated healthcare
system payers and providers. CHERISH guidance and input has resulted in addition of critical economic
components to comparative effectiveness studies that evaluate treatments delivered to individual participants
in healthcare or SUD treatment settings, including those evaluating interventions delivered at the health-
system or organization level. In this renewal period, we propose to expand our focus to add economic
components, develop economic methodologies, and improve knowledge translation strategies for health
outcome and implementation research that is conducted at the individual, system, and community levels.
Our proposal, entitled: “Health Economics of Substance Use Disorder, HCV, and HIV Treatment: Evaluating
Intervention Outcomes for Individuals, Systems, and Communities,” has the overall aim to develop and
disseminate health economic research on healthcare utilization, health outcomes, and health-related
behaviors that informs substance use disorder treatment policy and HCV and HIV care of people who use
substances. The Center includes 3 Research Support Cores (Methodology Core, Population Data & Modeling
Core, and Dissemination & Policy Core), a Pilot Grant & Training Core that serves as the Pilot Research Project
Core, and an Administrative Core. The Methodology Core will continue its highly successful Consultation
Service and will develop new methods related to economic evaluation in implementation studies and adaptive
interventions. The new Population Data & Modeling Core will draw on recent experience of Core members in
Massachusetts to promote new approaches to state data linkages for population-level economic evaluations,
and will support a research consortium that advances simulation modeling methods for these populations. The
Dissemination & Policy Core will continue to engage in dissemination science activities that directly assist
research teams and further the science, continue to hold bi-annual stakeholder conferences, and develop a new
knowledge dissemination curriculum. The Pilot Grant & Training Core will continue to use experts from the
other Cores and Research Affiliates to select, evaluate, and mentor competitive pilot grant awardees, will
conduct new training and mentorship activities, and will lead a diversity initiative for the Center. The
Administrative Core will continue to provide infrastructure and leadership to all Cores."

The Chicago Cancer Health Equity Collaborative (ChicagoCHEC) is a comprehensive partnership to advance
cancer health equity bringing together the synergistic strengths of two federally designated Hispanic Serving
Institutions, the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU), with a world
class NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center – the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of
Northwestern University (NU-LCC). ChicagoCHEC combines the attributes of these three exceptional
institutions, each with robust capacity to interact with their urban-shared setting. Launched in 2015,
ChicagoCHEC is dedicated to advancing cancer health equity through rigorous and innovative science,
education, and outreach and engagement of Chicago’s underserved communities. This is reflected in the
following goals: Aim 1. To strengthen a transformational alliance between UIC, NEIU, and the NU-LCC in pursuit
of cancer health equity in Chicago; Aim 2. To initiate, conduct, and support innovative bench, translational,
clinical, and prevention and control focused cancer research, with emphasis on cancer health disparities; Aim
3. To develop and implement cancer-related education and outreach activities generated with the engagement
of underserved communities across Chicago; Aim 4. To coordinate research education and mentoring
opportunities to recruit, retain, and advance a pipeline of underrepresented students in cancer research careers
and to develop early career faculty who will forge independent cancer research careers; and Aim 5. To conduct
ongoing rigorous evaluation of ChicagoCHEC activities. These goals are accomplished by a nurturing hub of
four Cores (Administrative, Planning and Evaluation, Research Education, and Outreach) and a research project
funding program. Since the launch of ChicagoCHEC in 2015, there has been rapid growth in collaborative
infrastructure built across the three partnering institutions; enhanced cancer research engagement, capacity,
and education; extensive community outreach and engagement; and encouraging advancement of
ChicagoCHEC faculty and students. ChicagoCHEC projects and programs provided research experiences to
155 students, provided cancer research and leadership opportunities for 57 faculty (21 have been
promoted/received tenure), and directly resulted in 94 peer-reviewed publications, 47 extramural grants
submitted, and 24 grants awarded. ChicagoCHEC will leverage the momentum forged by the initial U54 award
to drive innovative cancer research, research education, and community outreach and engagement that cuts
across disciplinary and institutional boundaries. ChicagoCHEC will leverage its diverse team of faculty, students,
and partners, connectivity to Chicago’s underserved communities, and guidance of internal and external advisory
bodies. The next chapter will include two initial full cancer research projects and two initial pilot projects,
continued support from four tri-institutional ChicagoCHEC Cores, and strong institutional commitment."

10895416,"Pediatric HIV/AIDS & Infection-Related Malignancies Research Consortium for Sub-Saharan Africa
(PARCA)
The goal of this proposal is to establish PARCA, a collaborative clinical and translational research framework
designed with the overarching goal to improve the current unacceptably poor outcomes of children with HIV-
associated malignancies in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Currently, over 80% of children with cancer in the US
survive, whereas over 80% in the majority of SSA countries die. To begin to address this disparity and improve
outcomes for children with cancer in SSA, Texas Children's Hospital leveraged the clinical infrastructure of
BIPAI in Uganda, Malawi, and Botswana to establish Global HOPE (Hematology-Oncology Pediatric
Excellence). Global HOPE is dedicated to excellence in the care and treatment of children globally with cancer
and blood disorders through state-of-the-art treatments and cutting-edge research. These three Global HOPE
pediatric cancer programs, which treat patients nationwide, have begun to transform cancer care in SSA. In the
US, improvements in pediatric cancer survival were achieved largely through clinical and translational research
coordinated by cooperative groups such as the Children's Oncology Group. Following that model, we propose
to establish a framework for collaboration to enable advances for children in SSA living with HIV and
diagnosed with cancer through PARCA.
The Overarching Goals of the Consortium are to:
1. Define the descriptive epidemiology and infectious exposures related to pediatric malignancies in SSA. We
 will determine the incidence and outcomes of HIV-associated malignancy across the BIPAI network in SSA.
2. Conduct transformative inter-disciplinary collaborative research to reduce the burden of KS and lymphoma
 among children and adolescents in SSA. We will establish multi-center strategies for diagnosis, risk-
 stratification, and outcomes improvement for children with Kaposi sarcoma and lymphoma. These studies
 will be best conducted in Uganda, Malawi, and Botswana, where the pediatric patient population is large
 enough to establish meaningful results and conclusions. Validated results will be disseminated throughout
 our Global HOPE network, as it continues to expand operations in SSA.
3. Support the formation of a multi-national collaborative resource in clinical and translational research,
training, and career development for African scientific leaders in HIV and pediatric cancer. We will provide
myriad research and training opportunities for pediatric oncologists throughout SSA to participate in and
lead translational and clinical research. This program of scientific training will complement and supplement
the continued success of Global HOPE Paediatric Haematology and Oncology Fellowship Program."

disease, cancer, diabetes, and autoimmune disorders, which are prevalent in Oklahoma. However, metabolism-
related research resources and infrastructure are currently insufficient and scattered in Oklahoma. To address
these deficiencies, this Center for Cellular Metabolism Research in Oklahoma (CMRO) Phase I COBRE will
create and nurture excellence in cellular metabolism in Oklahoma. The CMRO is located at the Oklahoma

(CVB), Aging & Metabolism (AM), and Arthritis & Clinical Immunology (ACI). These new junior investigators are
the foundation for expansion and unification of cellular metabolism research. They will receive an appropriate
level and form of multidisciplinary mentoring from experienced and competitive scientists. The CMRO COBRE
aims to develop a critical mass of investigators who can secure external funding to support their research while
creating a new, exciting, multidisciplinary, and collaborative environment for sustained competitive research on
cellular metabolism in Oklahoma, which will be achieved through five Aims: 1) Support five promising young
Project Leaders to scientific independence through incorporation of cellular metabolism research in their labs; 2)
Promote novel multidisciplinary research focusing on cellular metabolism through mentoring the junior Project
Leaders from three different OMRF Research Programs; 3) Integrate existing and new resources through Core
facilities that support cellular metabolism research; 4) Promote an environment that supports the success and
development of an independent sustainable center. The COBRE support will be critical to create a new,

10904973,"The molecular epidemiology of lung cancer in Africa is almost completely unknown, yet molecular profiling and
institution of targeted therapy is now standardly used to influence care in patients with actionable mutations. HIV-
infection is associated with a markedly increased risk of lung cancer, but its association with lung cancer and
how it influences disease outcomes is not well studied. The capacity to correctly diagnose lung cancer on
radiological images, tissue specimen acquisition, and subsequent histologic confirmation compounds the
problem of under and misdiagnosis of lung cancer in Africa, especially with the prevalence and often presumptive
clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis infection. In this consortium proposal, we therefore seek to address the above
stated problems by 1) establishing national lung cancer diagnostic referral networks in Uganda and Tanzania,
which will allow for improved detection of lung cancer and, hence decrease the lung cancer burden; 2)
investigating the role of HIV-1 infection on the incidence and outcomes of lung cancer in the region; 3)
determining the molecular profile of lung cancer in East African countries in order to facilitate advocacy for scale-
up of targeted therapies (including immune-based therapies); 4) building capacity for lung cancer diagnosis and
care in terms of improving imaging, pathology, radiology and tissue acquisition and clinical care of lung cancer
5) creating a lung cancer research collaboration that will build capacity through mentoring of junior researchers
for future leadership in the field. At the end of this project, we envision an African-led lung cancer research
network, clinical expertise for sample acquisition and care, improved pathology and radiology diagnostics
services, a lung cancer screening program, and a large biorepository that should support lung cancer research
in the region for many years to come."

The present application seeks funding to continue the MIND Institute Intellectual and Developmental
Disabilities Research Center (IDDRC) at the University of California, Davis. The IDDRC was launched in 2013
and is the newest of the 14 IDDRCs in the network. The MIND Institute IDDRC will address four specific aims.
Aim 1 is to conduct interdisciplinary translational research that yields insights into the nature, causes, and
consequences of IDD and leads to innovative evidence-based approaches to prevention and treatment. To this
end, we propose 81 externally funded projects that reflect the themes of Integrated Biobehavioral
Characterization of IDD, Genetic and Environmental Contributions to IDD, and Treatment of IDD. These projects
are led by 43 investigators from 16 academic departments and 5 schools/colleges. 68 projects are funded by the
NIH, including 16 by NICHD. Aim 2 is to accelerate the pace of interdisciplinary translational research via the
operation of cost-effective, innovative, and widely used scientific cores. In addition to an Administrative Core, we
propose four scientific cores. The Clinical Translational Core will facilitate recruitment of diverse samples of
human participants, provide specialized clinical expertise to diagnose and characterize participants, support
complex phenotyping, collect and store biospecimens, and integrate digital technologies into treatment studies.
The Biological and Molecular Analysis Core will provide access to expertise and technologies in the areas of
immune function, cellular and molecular imaging, epigenetics, and environmental exposures as they relate to
neural development. The Rodent Behavior Core will provide assays of mouse and rat behavior, guidance in the
development of mutant rodent models, and support for preclinical evaluations of drug safety and efficacy. The
Biostatistics, Bioinformatics, and Research Design Core will provide support for study design, creation of
electronic data capture and management systems, and statistical analysis of complex multidimensional datasets.
Aim 3 is to improve the lives of people with IDD and reduce health and social disparities in care by developing
a robust plan for disseminating and implementing scientific discoveries. The plan will involve multiple paths of
communication to target professionals and policy makers, reach diverse communities, while being informed by
the perspectives of people with IDD and their families. Aim 4 is to conduct a signature research project that
examines the heterogeneity of outcomes and mechanisms underlying those outcomes in maternal autoantibody
related (MAR) autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which may account for as much as 20% of ASD cases. The
project will make use of existing human clinical data to inform the creation of rat model systems to test
hypotheses about causal mechanisms. The signature project addresses three RFA themes: Preventing and
mitigating the impact of exposures that can cause IDD, Outcome measures or biomarkers for interventions or
treatments, and Development of biomarkers or assessment measures in more than one IDD condition."

Despite recent advances in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the majority of AML patients relapse
following treatment and the overall five-year survival rate for adults with AML remains 25-29%. Thus, an urgent
need to improve therapy for AML patients remains. The MSK SPORE in Leukemia will leverage collective efforts
to develop effective targeted therapies and immunotherapeutic approaches for several recurrent molecular
subtypes of AML, including some which lack therapeutic options entirely. The overall translational aims of the
MSK SPORE in Leukemia are to 1) interrogate genetic and molecular pathways required for AML initiation and
maintenance; 2) develop novel targeted therapies and immunotherapeutic approaches for AML based on
recurrent genomic alterations and leukemia stem-cell (LSC) specific markers; and 3) identify and validate the
mechanism of action, therapeutic efficacy, and predictors of response/resistance of mechanism-based therapies
for AML patients. To pursue these aims, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with complementary
expertise in the clinical management of AML, cancer genetics, cancer epigenetics, functional genomics,
molecular pathology, biostatistics, computational biology, and multiplatform data integration. We will pursue
these aims through four projects, each addressing a different unmet need in the clinical management of AML.
Project 1 will elucidate genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of IDH inhibitor therapeutic resistance and perform
a clinical trial exploring the efficacy and safety of combining the FLT3 inhibitor gilteritinib with mutant selective
IDH1/2 inhibitors for FLT3/IDH-mutant AML. Project 2 will characterize the clinical, molecular, and biological
features of complex karyotype (CK) AML, for which there is no treatment, and validate a novel approach to
targeting CK AML via inhibition of the metabolic enzyme oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH). Project 3 will
evaluate a novel therapeutic approach for targeting common, poor prognosis spliceosomal-mutant AML subtypes
via inhibition of protein arginine methyltransferases in preclinical models and a phase I/II clinical trial. Project 4
will determine the safety and efficacy of a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell approach targeting a leukemia
stem cell-specific antigen while sparing normal hematopoietic stem cells, specifically, a fully humanized CD371
targeting CAR T cell platform bolstered by constitutive IL-18 secretion. All projects will be supported by the
Biospecimen, Biostatistics, Genomics, and Bioinformatics Shared Resource Cores, which will assist with
the preparation and analysis of human tissues and genomic, immune, and clinical data, and an Administrative
Core to ensure project integration. Finally, pilot projects in the Developmental Research Program and career
mentorship via the Career Enhancement Program are fully integrated into the SPORE to ensure that a future
generation of researchers is prepared to further advance our long-term objectives of enhancing therapy, reducing
the morbidity of treatments, and ultimately eliminating this disease as a cause of premature death"

from gene to protein to metabolite. Recognizing the central role of proteins and their post-translational
modifications (PTMs) in this process, the National Center for Quantitative Biology of Complex Systems was
founded to provide large-scale quantitative data for these molecules. Our Biotechnology Research Resource
aims to accelerate the pace, depth, and accuracy of quantifying the proteome, metabolome, and lipidome. Driven
by the needs of biomedical researchers, our mission is to develop technologies that provide rapid access to the
most comprehensive and accurate reporters of the biological state. Specifically we will (1) extend and ultimately
culminate our work to enable comprehensive biomolecule characterization; (2) develop and conclude our work
enabling highly multiplexed proteome quantification and (3) break ground on the development of the novel

We shall develop these technologies in the context of several high impact driving biomedical research projects

driving projects comprise two central themes. First, responding to the demands of biomedical researchers to
explore the roles of emergent and yet poorly understood biomolecules and their PTMs, we will target projects

that in addition to protein measurements our collaborators require new technologies to identify and quantify
metabolites and lipids to fully understand their biological systems of interest and we will work with a host of
projects that allow us to test and refine technologies for the large-scale systems and multi-omics analyses to
explore physiology and metabolism. Finally, we propose a multi-faceted approach to dissemination, training, and

The goal of this proposal is to form a Biomedical Technology Research Resource (BTRR) at SLAC National
Accelerator Laboratory that involves a set of interrelated Technology Research and Development (TR&D)
projects aimed at enhancing and developing the unique capabilities of the SLAC Linac Coherent Light Source
(LCLS) for biomedical applications. The BTRR will enable structural biology experiments that are extremely
difficult or impossible to perform at synchrotron (SR) or electron microscopy (cryoEM) facilities and will increase
the availability of these capabilities to the broader structural biology community. The enabled experiments will
facilitate paradigm-shifting advances on a wide variety of topics, including neurotransmission, signal
transduction, cellular metabolism, transcription and viral infection. The proposed TR&Ds are tightly coupled with
the research themes of the nine Driving Biomedical Projects (DBPs). These research themes focus on
developments to visualize large complexes and membrane proteins, such as GPCRs and that provide accurate
active site structures of metalloenzymes, such as ribonucleotide reductase and cytochrome c oxidase, and
complex macromolecular machines, such as RNA polymerase-II. Finally, a common research area of all DBPs
involve time-resolved (TR) studies that include research to follow dynamic processes involved in adenine
riboswitch signaling, the transport mechanism of N. gonorrhoeae MtrF, antibiotic binding to β-lactamase and
examination of interaction specificity of CypA variants.
All DBPs hinge on highly efficient data collection methods, which are required for successful macromolecular
crystallography (MC) experiments at X-ray FELs. The high peak brightness of an X-ray FEL pulse destroys the
crystal volume exposed, bringing about sample refreshment challenges previously unknown to the MC SR
community. As a result, the sample must be continually replenished throughout the experiment. As part of the
TR&Ds, sample injectors that rapidly deliver crystals and sample solutions to the X-ray beam will be optimized
and automated during LCLS experiments along with data analysis to gauge experimental success and optimize
use of limited sample and beam time. Time resolved studies hinge on improvements to mixing injectors, laser
activation and complementary spectroscopic methods. X-ray FEL beam time is scarce so careful characterization
of samples and complex experimental setups prior to beam time is critical to ensure experimental success, in
particular for complex time resolved measurements of sensitive metalloenzymes intermediates. Experimental
design and testing, sample production, sample characterization (including spectroscopic analysis) and crystal
quality screening are supported in the laboratory, at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) and
during screening beam time at LCLS. Integrating with, and enhancing the existing programs at SSRL and LCLS,
the BTRR will provide support, expertise and training to the biomedical community."
10808870,"SUMMARY
Common and rare genetic diseases affect a large fraction of the world’s population. Elucidating the
mechanisms by which naturally occurring genetic variants affect disease risk requires multidisciplinary
expertise in quantitative, population, molecular, cellular and developmental genetics; statistics, bioinformatics
and computational biology; and functional genomics in cell culture and animal models. We propose a Center of
Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) in Human Genetics that constitutes a unique partnership between
the Clemson University Center for Human Genetics and the Greenwood Genetic Center. Research in the
COBRE in Human Genetics will focus on understanding the genetic, genomic, and epigenetic mechanisms by
which molecular genetic variation affects rare and common diseases. The COBRE in Human Genetics will
support four research projects from junior investigators that tackle several of the outstanding challenges facing
modern human genetics, including the roles of human long non-coding RNAs in risk for human disease, the
effects of structural variation on disease phenotypes and gene regulation, development of animal models for
rare diseases, and incorporating context-dependent effects into statistical models predicting complex trait
phenotypes from large scale genetic variation data. Eight Pilot Projects led by junior investigators will
contribute additional breadth and depth of research topics to the COBRE in Human Genetics. The Research
Project Leaders will be mentored by established external NIH-funded researchers as well as the three PIs. The
Research and Pilot Project Leaders will be supported by an Administrative Core that provides a wide range of
professional development activities. The COBRE in Human Genetics will establish both Internal and External
Advisory Committees and implement a comprehensive Evaluation Plan. The projects will be supported by a
state-of-the-art Genomics and Bioinformatics Research Core that will benefit two other Clemson University
COBREs as well as other faculty at Clemson University and the Greenwood Genetic Center. The COBRE in
Human Genetics has strong institutional support, with commitments to hire additional faculty to expand the
scope of the research activities during this period of support, and to provide graduate student research
assistantships to support the research projects. The research performed by the Project Leaders of the COBRE
in Human Genetics will provide new knowledge of the mechanisms by which molecular genetic variation
affects variation in complex traits in health and disease, enhance the national reputation of Clemson University
as a research and training center in human genetics, and set the stage for future development of institutional
training grants and program projects. This COBRE will strengthen the biomedical research infrastructure of
Clemson University and increase the number of NIH-funded scientists in the state of South Carolina."

 More than 5 million Americans live with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias
(AD/ADRD), and they receive care from more than 16 million family caregivers. Providing high
quality care in the community for people with AD/ADRD is a national priority. Persons with
AD/ADRD who are enrolled in Medicaid are eligible to receive home and community-based
services (HCBS). HCBS programs vary by state but in general include supportive services (e.g.,
adult day services and personal care). HCBS are provided by states as an alternative to
institutional care and are believed to promote the clients’ independence, health, well-being and
help avoid or delay more intensive health care utilization (e.g., nursing home admission). But
very little is known about the impact of HCBS for people living with AD/ADRD, including whether
person-reported outcomes differ for those with and without AD/ADRD, and whether person-
reported HCBS outcomes influence use of health care. To determine whether HCBS improve
outcomes that matter to clients, we must first better understand the role of these services from
the perspective of care recipients (i.e., person-reported outcomes).Toward that end, we propose
to use data from the National Core Indicators-Aging and Disabilities (NCI-AD) Adult Consumer
Survey collected between 2017-2020 (n>17,000 HCBS respondents each year), which measure
HCBS quality and service outcomes from clients’ perspectives. We also propose to link NCI-AD
and Medicare and Medicaid claims for respondents in Minnesota (the only state where this
linkage is currently possible) to understand the relationship between person-reported HCBS
outcomes and health care use. In response to RFA AG-20-037 we propose the following
specific aims: 1. Document trends in the HCBS used and/or desired by clients with and
without AD/ADRD. We expect that persons with AD/ADRD will indicate a greater desire to use
more HCBS than they currently receive compared to those without AD/ADRD. 2. Determine
client and state-level factors that promote person-reported HCBS outcomes among
persons with and without AD/ADRD. Hypothesis 2a: Persons with AD/ADRD will have
significantly poorer person-reported HCBS outcomes than persons without AD/ADRD.
Hypothesis 2b: Greater state investment in HCBS relative to institutional care will be associated
with significantly more positive person-reported outcomes for clients both with and without
AD/ADRD. 3. Determine the association between health plan-level HCBS person-reported
quality and health care use (emergency department, hospitalizations, potentially
avoidable hospitalizations, and nursing home admission) for persons with and without
AD/ADRD. Clients who receive HCBS from high quality plans (based on person-reported
outcomes) will use less health care than their counterparts, and this difference will be larger for
clients with AD/ADRD. This study has the potential to yield new evidence both for how HCBS
influence important outcomes for persons with AD/ADRD, and for the policy-relevant outcome of
health care use."

Notch 3 mutations are the cause of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts
and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), a small vessel disease characterized by stroke and vascular
cognitive impairment. Transgenic mouse studies from our lab and others have shown that Notch 3 sig-
naling is critical for mural cell survival, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, and that Notch 3 knock-
out mice have increased susceptibility to hypoxia-induced stroke. Loss of mural cells (MCs), including
pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs), in the small penetrating arteries of the brain is a
hallmark of CADASIL and a major contributor to vascular dysfunction. Importantly, in both humans and
mouse models, loss-of-function (LOF) Notch 3 mutations cause MC death. Currently, there are no tar-
geted therapies available for CADASIL. We have also shown that antibodies can be used to modulate
Notch 3 signaling in mouse models of CADASIL. Specifically, we showed that a mouse monoclonal an-
tibody administered in a CADASIL mouse model can prevent MC loss. Our proposal will optimize a mo-
dality of treatment for CADASIL by humanizing a mouse monoclonal Notch 3 agonist antibody. Our pro-
ject goals are as follows. Aim 1. To generate a panel of agonist Notch3 human monoclonal antibodies
(humAbs). We propose to humanize a mouse monoclonal antibody capable of activating human Notch
3, via grafting of complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) into human framework regions (FRs).
Aim 2. To rank order the candidate antibodies using in vitro assays. We will screen candidate human-
ized antibodies for the preservation of specific Notch 3 antigen recognition using a sensitive in vitro
ELISA test detecting target engagement and activation of human Notch3 receptors via release of the
Notch 3 extracellular domain (N3ECD) biomarker. Aim 3. Prepare cell line for the production of lead
humAb. We will produce at least two humanized A13 (huA13) for preclinical in vivo testing by generat-
ing a cell line using Switchable Membrane Reporter (SwiMR) technology for antibody production. Aim
4. To test the preclinical efficacy of lead Notch 3 humAbs in mouse models of Notch 3 deficiency and
CADASIL. We will screen our humanized antibody candidates for biologic effects including Notch 3 acti-
vation in CNS vessels, crossing the blood-CNS barrier, normalization of N3ECD in blood, a target en-
gagement biomarker linked to Notch3 signaling in vivo, and rescue of mural cell loss. Aim 5. To evalu-
ate toxicity and pharmacokinetics. We will examine toxicity and pharmacokinetics antibody administra-
tion of increasing single-dose in mice."

This application is a request for renewal funding of the SPORE in Prostate Cancer P50 CA180995 at the Robert
H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University in collaboration with the University of Chicago
Comprehensive Cancer Center and NorthShore University HealthSystem, an affiliate of the University of
Chicago. The SPORE first received support from the National Cancer Institute in 2001; a renewal application
was funded in 2009. In 2015, we were the recipients of a new SPORE and we are now requesting continued
funding for this program. Our SPORE unites basic scientists, clinicians, pathologists, biostatisticians,
bioinformaticists and advocates from our academic institutions, all of whom are dedicated to advancing
translational prostate cancer research. In this application we propose three highly translational and innovative
research projects that have both basic science and clinical science co-leadership: Project 1: Targeting the MYC
Pathway in Prostate Cancer (Abdulkadir, Hussain); Project 2: Re-directing the sensitivity of metastatic
castration-resistant prostate cancer to immunotherapy (Wu, Sosman, Morgans); Project 3: STING Activation to
Overcome Resistance to Immune Checkpoint Blockade in PTEN-deficient Prostate Cancer (Patnaik, Gajewski,
Stadler). Three core facilities support the proposed research projects: Administrative, Leadership and Advocacy
(Abdulkadir, Hussain, Stadler); Biostatistics/Bioinformatics (Kocherginsky, Zhao) and Biospecimen (Yang).
Internal and External Advisory Boards provide a source of scientific input to members of the SPORE team on a
biannual and yearly basis, respectively. Our Advocacy Group are well established in the SPORE arena and
make a valued contribution to our success. The SPORE includes Developmental Research and Career
Enhancement Programs, both of which provide a source of innovation and new discoveries. All together, we
anticipate that the results obtained from our research endeavors will have a significant impact on the health of
patients diagnosed with prostate cancer."

The University of Washington Eunice Kennedy Shriver Intellectual and Developmental
Disabilities Research Center (IDDRC), based at the Center on Human Development
and Disability (CHDD), provides a comprehensive interdisciplinary program of basic and
translational research designed to prevent, diagnose, and treat individuals with
intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). Research is carried out within the
framework of the following 8 Collaborative Research Areas (CRAs): (1) Biological Basis
of Autism; (2) Brain Malformation Disorders; (3) Central Nervous System Injury; (4)
Consortium on Early Childhood Intervention; (5) Developmental Toxicology; (6)
Epilepsy; (7) Hearing Disorders, and (8) Learning Disabilities. All CRAs are
interdisciplinary, include scientists, clinicians, and trainees and are designed to promote
translational research. In this application, to facilitate the work of investigators at our
IDDRC, we are requesting support for an Administrative Core designed to provide
scientific and programmatic leadership and four scientific cores: (1) Genetics --
functional and human genomics and model system components; (2) Brain Imaging -- in
vivo imaging for human studies and animal models; (3) Animal Behavior -- behavioral
testing for rodent models and consultation for non-human primate models and
application of circuit mapping techniques; and (4) Clinical Translational -- promotes and
supports clinical and translational research. We are also proposing to conduct a
research project focusing on a unique cerebellar malformation utilizing comprehensive-
omic approaches that are well integrated with cores and other IDDRC activities.
Extensive research training and dissemination activities are also integral components of
our IDDRC."
10866357,"In the field of HIV-associated malignancies, East Africa faces three intersecting problems common to
resource-limited settings. First, East Africa lacks effective primary and secondary prevention strategies for
cervical cancer and Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS), two of the most common cancers not only among HIV-infected
persons but in the general population. Survival for both malignancies is poor due to multiple factors
including lack of screening, advanced disease stage at presentation, suboptimal diagnostic tests and fragile
linkage to care. Second, there is a paucity of local principal investigators to lead research related to HIV-
associated cancer. Third, there are no robust research networks to study primary and secondary prevention
of HIV-associated cancers in the region. To address this, eight institutions in the U.S. and East Africa will:
 Aim 1. Create a collaborative network of U.S.-based and East African-based scientists and
 institutions — the United States-East Africa HIV-Associated Malignancy Research Center
 (USEAHAMRC) — focused on career development and the performance of research related to
 prevention, early detection and efficient linkage to care for virus-related cancers;
 Aim 2. Support the career development of emerging African principal investigators, U.S.-based
 junior investigators and others in the USEAHAMRC in the performance of HIV and other virus-
 related cancer research; and
 Aim 3. Conduct novel research — led by our emerging African principal investigators — related
 to the prevention, early detection and efficient linkage to care for virus-related cancers.
The USEAHAMRC will build on prior work in U54 CA190153 to create a network of scientists from 4 U.S.
institutions (UCSF, Duke, Massachusetts General Hospital, and the National Library of Medicine) and 4
African institutions in 3 East African countries (Infectious Diseases Institute in Uganda; Moi University in
Kenya; Kenya Medical Research Institute; and Muhimbili University in Tanzania) (Aim 1). We will model our
career development activities after NIH-sponsored institutional mentored career development programs
(Aim 2). Managed by a Developmental Core, these activities will include professional enrichment to all
interested junior scientists at our participating institutions, mentoring of a select group of African and U.S.-
based junior scientists to compete for career development awards, and a Pilot Project program to attract
new junior scientists. Our African junior investigators will also lead two research projects (Aim 3): Project 1,
A Public Health Approach to Cervical Cancer Prevention in East Africa; and Project 2, Rapid Case
Ascertainment as a Tool for Epidemiologic Investigation and Efficient Linkage to Care in HIV-infected
Patients Diagnosed with Kaposi Sarcoma in East Africa. A Data Management and Biostatistical Analysis
Core (DMBAC) will support all of the science. Finally, an Administrative Core will oversee all operations."
10782997,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Overall Plan for the Translational Hearing Center
This Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) application is to establish the Translational Hearing
Center, administered by centrally-located Creighton University, with Boys Town National Research Hospital
(BTNRH) and the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC), as institutional partners. Our overall goal is
to build a critical mass of academic translational researchers developing therapeutic interventions to preserve or
restore hearing and vestibular function from a wide range of etiologies that cause hearing loss and vestibular
deficits. Hearing loss in infants and children results in delayed acquisition of listening and spoken language skills
critical for academic achievement and maximal career trajectories of affected individuals. In the aging population,
hearing loss and vestibular deficits without appropriate rehabilitation accelerates aging and cognitive decline.
Aim 1: Develop the infrastructure and expertise base for translational auditory and vestibular research.
COBRE funding will enable an Administrative Core within the Center to provide a unique, transformational
research environment for junior investigators to translate their basic science discoveries into therapeutic
strategies that preserve or restore hearing and vestibular function. This will establish a broader nonclinical
research program. The Administrative Core will coordinate interactions between project leaders with their
Mentors, and an External Advisory Committee. The Administrative Core will develop a Drug Discovery and
Delivery Core that will coordinate necessary drug screen assays and production of derivatives of lead
compounds and their delivery to the inner ear and associated central neural pathways, as well as an Auditory
Vestibular Technology Core to validate the efficacy of lead candidate ototherapeutics hits.
Aim 2: Build a critical mass of funded investigators leading translational auditory and vestibular
research. We will examine both peripheral and central mechanisms of hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction,
and identify pharmacotherapeutic strategies preserve or restore hearing and vestibular function, with multiple
levels of research funding for investigators. We also have an outstanding Mentoring Plan for project leaders,
complementing their expertise with senior investigations as Internal Mentors and biostatistical support, as well
as outside investigators with translational and clinical expertise as External Mentors. Additional mentoring is
provided by Research Core staff, grantsmanship classes and Mock Study Sections of proposals prior to review.
Evaluations of research progress, and all other Center activities, are also key to optimize Center success.
The Center will also benefit from the burgeoning translational research environment in Omaha, Nebraska. Future
plans call for continued expansion of the Center to include submission of Investigational New Drug applications,
safety and efficacy studies and clinical trials in partnership with patient populations served by Creighton
University’s academic medical center, Catholic Health Initiatives (CHI) Health system, BTNRH and UNMC."
10891536,"ABSTRACT: OVERALL COMPONENT: Innovations for screening and prognosis in HIV+ cancers
including Kaposi sarcoma, cervical cancer, and lymphoma in Malawi and South Africa
In response to RFA-CA-20-001, this application proposes to establish the UNC-Malawi-South Africa Cancer
Consortium (UMSACC), to develop capacity and conduct high-impact research focused on HIV-associated
cancers. The consortium builds on longstanding collaborations between the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill, Lighthouse Trust in Malawi, Malawi Ministry of Health, Malawi College of Medicine, the University
of the Witwatersrand, South Africa, and Stellenbosch University, South Africa. These partnerships have been
made possible by leadership and participation in NIH networks conducting basic, clinical and epidemiologic
research in the region. These existing relationships and robust infrastructure can now be leveraged for HIV-
associated malignancies, which are overwhelming contributors to cancer burden in Malawi and South Africa
even after widespread antiretroviral therapy usage. UMSACC is focused on the three most common HIV-
associated cancers, Kaposi sarcoma (KS), cervical cancer, and lymphoma, and addresses the NIH HIV/AIDS
research priorities by focusing on HIV-associated comorbidities which includes these AIDS-defining cancers.
UMSACC proposes innovations for screening and prognosis of these cancers in persons living with HIV
(PLWH) with the overall goal being to improve the health of PLWH.
Our consortium will be led by principal investigators with highly complementary expertise using a team science
approach. To support consortium objectives, a diverse team of investigators has been assembled spanning the
clinical, population, and basic sciences, and includes Malawian, South African, and US scientific leaders.
Moreover, a high priority is the training and support of junior investigators in the U.S. and Africa. The
consortium will enhance existing administrative, operational, and research relationships between all partnering
institutions and investigators. The External Advisory Board and Scientific Advisors will ensure that the
consortium remains highly responsive to community needs in Malawi and South Africa, while also addressing
urgent research questions facing the international HIV-associated cancer community.
A focus of this consortium is to develop Malawi and South Africa to become international leaders in HIV-
associated cancer research. Building on prior successes and partnerships outlined in this application,
UMSACC is extremely well-positioned to catalyze a broad, coordinated, cancer control effort in Malawi and
South Africa, and to advance the overall NCI scientific agenda for sub-Saharan Africa to reduce HIV-
associated cancer burden in low- and middle-income countries."
10898756,"BEAMS ABSTRACT: Overall
Prevalence of childhood asthma has significantly increased in the last decades, and one potential explanation
for this upsurge is decreased exposure to protective environmental microbes due to improvements in sanitation
and use/overuse of antimicrobial products during pregnancy and early life. In support of this contention, several
studies in isolated rural communities have reported lower prevalence of asthma among children of animal
farmers more heavily exposed to environmental microbes than among their non-farmer peers. If these
observations are applicable to more mainstream US populations is unknown. We recently observed that Mexican
American children living in Tucson, Arizona have a prevalence of childhood asthma that is fourfold higher than
in Nogales, Mexico. This dramatic difference in rates of asthma suggests that, even in this limited geographic
region and among an ancestrally similar population, differential exposures may exist which account for relative
protection against asthma in Mexico. Tucson is only 70 miles north of Nogales, Mexico, which is a 200k inhabitant
city located just south of the US-Mexico border. Nogales, Mexico lacks public sanitation facilities and poverty
rates are very high. In preliminary data, we observed marked differences in microbial communities present in
dust, drinking water, and in stools of one-month-old children between the two cities. Based on these findings,
we propose the Binational Early Asthma and Microbiome Study (BEAMS). The BEAMS overall goals are: to
identify divergent early-life microbial and immune developmental trajectories associated with asthma protection
in Nogales, Mexico compared with Tucson, Arizona, and the environmental factors that promote them; to isolate
the specific microbes, genes and their products that confer such protection; and to ascertain the mechanisms by
which these microbial communities or their products promote asthma protection. To accomplish these goals,
BEAMS will have three Projects and four Cores. We will enroll 250 pregnant mother/offspring dyads of Mexican
ancestry in each city. We will thoroughly assess environmental microbial exposure, maternal gut microbiota and
microbial gene expression, maternal immune markers and meconium microbiome. We will relate these
characteristics to child’s fecal microbiome and metabolome in early life, to asthma-related immune markers in
the child’s blood, as assessed by mass cytometry analysis and single cell epigenetic and gene expression
studies, and to asthma-related clinical phenotypes by age 2 years. We will also assess in mouse models the
specific molecular mechanism that explain the protective effects against the development of childhood asthma
of specific microbial strains and metabolites present in Nogales, Mexico. We expect BEAMS to offer a better
understanding of the early origins of asthma and new asthma prevention strategies applicable to Mexican-
Americans, and potentially to all Americans."
10549858,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Targeting the immune system to destroy cancer cells using immunotherapy has rapidly emerged as a promising
avenue for treating cancer, and has resulted in robust clinical responses in a subset of patients. While the initial
success stories have provided proof of concept that the immune system can be harnessed to treat cancer, the
majority of patients do not achieve long lasting or even initial benefit, highlighting the need to better understand
the barriers to successfully using the immune system to eliminate cancer cells. The focus of this proposal is non-
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which has only shown 20-40% of patients having an objective response to
immune based therapies to date. A major obstacle to improving current immunotherapies in lung cancer is a lack
of understanding of the overarching T cell response during tumorigenesis. Indeed, few studies have been able
to longitudinally dissect the CD8 T cell response in a physiological time frame in the native lung
microenvironment. Previous work has identified a population of less dysfunctional T cells in the tumor that
express the transcription factor T cell factor 1 (TCF-1), and it is this population that is thought to mediate
productive anti-tumor responses. However, how to generate these cells when they are lacking, the
developmental trajectories of these cells during tumorigenesis, and how to best target these cells for therapeutic
purposes remain unclear. The goal of this project is to address these critical questions surrounding the TCF-1+
subset of anti-tumor CD8 T cells using an autochthonous mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma that
recapitulates both the time scale and anatomical progression of human NSCLC. Utilizing cutting edge
methodologies and techniques, including single cell RNA sequencing, parabiosis and proximity labeling, we will
define the ontogeny, differentiation, function, and determinants that dictate the fate of responding anti-tumor
TCF-1+ CD8 T cells. In Aim 1, we will build on our preliminary data demonstrating heterogeneity within the TCF-
1+ CD8 T cell compartment by elucidating functionality and transcriptional status of anti-tumor CD8 T cell
populations. We will compare the transcriptomic data we generate in Aim 1 to existing human single cell RNA
sequencing to determine the relevance of the CD8 T cell states we identify in our model. In Aim 2 we will
determine the role of tumor-T cell interactions in T cell phenotype and fate using a proximity labeling system to
identify CD8 T cells that have recently interacted with tumor cells. In Aim 3, we will define the relationship of
lymph node and lung TCF-1+ CD8 T cells, and will attempt to therapeutically harness anti-tumor CD8 T cells
within the dLN to seed more TCF-1+ CD8 T cells into the tumor. Taken together, our aims are positioned to
redefine our understanding of the anti-tumor CD8 T cell response and potentially identify new therapeutic
avenues to treat cancer."

 This P50 award will continue to support the Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center
(IDDRC), which has been central to the scientific enterprise at the Kennedy Krieger Institute (KKI) and Johns
Hopkins University (JHU) for over 30 years—supporting investigators seeking to understand, treat and
ameliorate the adverse impact of intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), and to disseminate
discoveries to the public toward a goal of prevention. The IDDRC continues to be structured around five Cores:
(1) Administrative; (2) Clinical Translational; (3) Genomics; (4) Neuroimaging; and, (5) Behavioral Phenotyping,
as well an integrated Research Project examining the role of sleep, circadian dysfunction, and brain
development in children with autism.
 The Center's organization and Core structure are aligned with the research priorities of the NICHD IDD
branch, including understanding etiology and complex comorbidities of IDD; improving early identification and
screening; identification of biomarkers and outcome measures; understanding natural history; and translation
of discovery to treatment and, ultimately, to public policy—all with a goal of prevention. The Center's
translational science theme centers on progressing knowledge along the continuum from “labs to clinics to
communities.” In keeping with these goals, this Center's aims promote translational science along the full
continuum of T4 translation. This emphasis is employed throughout the Center, with added importance on
dissemination through the Administrative Core via links to the Institute's UCEDD (Maryland Center for
Developmental Disabilities) and Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental Disabilities (LEND) programs.
 The Center's aims are to: (1) provide infrastructure, expertise, and services necessary to promote and
facilitate interdisciplinary research in the field of IDD; (2) act as the vehicle through which inter-institutional
partnerships (including inter-IDDRC partnerships) addressing IDD research are developed and implemented;
(3) provide training and technical assistance opportunities related to scientific inquiry within the field of IDD;
and (4) serve as a hub (both locally and nationally) for translation and dissemination of scientific discoveries
related to IDD toward the goal of informing (and ultimately shaping) public policy."
10815706,"ABSTRACT
 Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are different diseases clinically and
the most important tissue damage occurs in joints and kidneys, respectively. Yet, both SLE and RA share a
central common theme of adaptive T and B cell interactions that result in autoantibody production. Both tissues
develop chronic inflammatory reactions that also include myeloid cell populations, neutrophils and other innate
leukocytes. The two diseases cluster in families and share a number of closely related risk alleles suggesting
related immune mechanisms. Developing targeted therapies for lupus has been frustrating and while a
number of therapies can reduce disease activity in RA, a large unmet need exists in the form of TNF
inadequate responders; and there is no cure.
 Based on the RA/SLE AMP consortium, single cell RNA-seq and CyTOF analysis has phenotypically
and transcriptionally identified many unexpected cell types and cell states present in the inflamed kidney in
lupus nephritis and RA synovitis. Here, we select a set of important cell populations specific to, or highly
enriched in, the involved tissues in both diseases. Given the importance of B cells and antibody production,
we focus on the novel subset of age (or autoimmunity) associated B cells (ABC B cells) and B helper T cells
including both T follicular helper (Tfh) and the recently discovered T peripheral helper (Tph) T cells in Project 1.
The project focuses on defining the relationship of ABC to other B cell populations and examines the role of
Tph and Tfh cells in driving ABC B cells and their cross-talk. ABC B cells and Tph/Tfh cells are enriched in
both lupus kidney and RA synovium allowing their comparison across diseases. Project 2 examines novel
macrophage inflammatory states found in lupus kidney and seeks to define the main activating factors and
transcription factors that drive cell state changes to achieve the inflammatory CM4 state that predominates in
nephritis. Project 3 examines the fibroblastic stroma that drives inflammation in RA. A population of
inflammatory sublining CD90+DR+ fibroblasts is profoundly expanded in RA and implicated in perpetuating
inflammation. Project 3 examines the role of a Notch gradient and Notch signaling in driving the differentiation
and activation of this population in synovium and kidney and its role in inflammatory arthritis. All 3 projects
interact to examine the cell types of interest across diseases, to determine which cells are interacting most
closely by integrated imaging analysis. By utilizing the synchronized expert pipelines of the Computational
Systems Immunology Core for single cell RNA-seq and image analysis, the data gathered from both diseases
and tissues can be effectively compared. All 3 projects focus on determining the drivers and transitions that
yield the important cell states that have been discovered directly in the involved tissues. Together, the program
will provide new insights into the tissue immunopathology in these human autoimmune diseases and help to
unfold new avenues for therapeutic intervention."
10833115,"Project Summary for Overall Section of the Arkansas Integrative Metabolic Research Center (AIMRC):
The University of Arkansas - Fayetteville (U of A) is the flagship campus of the State of Arkansas, but does not
have active NIH COBRE funding on campus. A clear strength in biomedical research has emerged organically
on campus, with the majority of NIH funding at the U of A involving research on cell and tissue metabolism. This
collection of NIH-funded researchers on campus will initiate and develop a cross-disciplinary research center at
the University of Arkansas titled, the Arkansas Integrative Metabolic Research Center (AIMRC). Dr. Kyle Quinn,
an established leader in the field of metabolic imaging and biomedical optics, with ongoing collaborations with
the other NIH-funded metabolic researchers on campus will direct the center. The scientific theme of the AIMRC
is to understand the role of cell and tissue metabolism in disease, development, and repair through research
involving advanced imaging, bioenergetics, and data science. By elucidating the complex relationship between
metabolism and different disease states using established bioenergetics assays, advanced label-free imaging
technology and cutting-edge data science approaches, novel therapeutic targets and mechanistic insights can
be identified to establish new treatment approaches for a variety of diseases. The AIMRC will have an
administrative core, three research cores, and four research projects led by junior investigator Project Leaders.
The Administrative Core will coordinate center activities, oversee the recruitment and mentoring of junior faculty,
and coordinate a Pilot Project Program. The AIMRC will invest in existing state-of-the-art microscopy service
centers on campus to establish an Imaging and Spectroscopy Core focused on label-free metabolic imaging and
spectroscopy. A Bioenergetics Core will employ state-of-the-art live cell metabolic assay platforms in conjunction
with established flow cytometry tools to provide quantitative insights into the mitochondrial and metabolic health
of the cells. A Data Science Core will also be established by leveraging our high-performance computing
resources and expertise on campus to assist researchers with analyzing, integrating, and synthesizing large
datasets generated by the research cores and center members. The AIMRC will support four junior faculty
members to lead Research Projects to study different aspects of cell and tissue metabolism that include:
understanding the mechanisms of breast cancer innervation, evaluating the effects of post-translational
modifications in breast cancer, evaluating the effect of methionine metabolism in melanoma, and elucidating cell
signaling and mitochondrial dynamics during epithelial morphogenesis. The near-term goal is to follow a center
organization and management plan to establish the foundation of the center by recruiting, developing, and
mentoring junior investigators. Ultimately, we plan to grow the center to a critical mass of researchers that
sustains the center and allows it to be competitive for a wide range of extramural support in metabolic research."
10880522,"Overall Project Abstract
For the third cycle of the Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center at Washington University,
we propose a next phase in a comprehensive approach to understanding, ameliorating, and/or preventing
neurodevelopmental disability through translational scientific investigation at the respective levels of cell,
synapse, circuit, and behavior, capitalizing upon major strengths of WUSTL in genomics, behavioral/cognitive
neuroscience, and clinical-translational science. The overarching goals of our Center are as follows: (1) To
sustain and evolve an integrated structure of core scientific facilities that occupy a critical niche in the scientific
community, attract and support highly-qualified investigators, and facilitate high-caliber, translational research
on the pathogenesis and treatment of IDDs. In this application we propose specific enhancements to each of our
scientific core facilities: an expanded technical team for the Developmental Neuroimaging Core, a dedicated
cellular models unit within the Model Systems Core (methods calibrated with a cross-IDDRC working group for
cellular models of IDD co-led by the IDDRC@WUSTL), and a new clinical trials / natural history studies unit
within the Clinical-Translational Core (CTC). The CTC will continue to facilitate the collection and interpretation
of genomic, phenotypic, environmental and biomarker data across generations, and promote step-wise
translation of new discoveries on risk and pathogenesis to higher-impact interventions for patients. The
IDDRC@WUSTL will provide critical infrastructure for research efforts that have created synergies with other
intramural and extramural Centers/Institutes, including a newly-funded in-depth longitudinal study of infants born
to mothers enrolled in the March of Dimes Prematurity Research Center Cohort, the launch of a prospective
replication cohort for the Infant Brain Imaging Study of Autism (IBIS), two multisite initiatives in Down Syndrome,
and an NIH Autism Center of Excellence Network in gene discovery. (2) To cultivate nodes of new
interdisciplinary scientific activity within the Center, in frontiers of IDD research which are critical for the derivation
of higher-impact treatment and preventive intervention, along the Center’s four major themes: (i) the prevention
of prematurity and its neurodevelopmental consequences; (ii) the identification of intermediate phenotypes in the
development of IDD; (iii) structural and functional characterization of the developing human brain, and (iv)
functional genomics relevant to IDD pathogenesis. In this cycle we will build on prior successes in cultivating a
dynamic, interactive, and productive community of scientists engaged in IDD-science, challenging itself to
generate and harness new knowledge toward translational advances in therapeutics and prevention. (3) To
conduct a signature research project that represents a bold, critical step toward higher-impact intervention for
IDD. In this project, a novel platform for standardizing multi-omic characterization of the consequences of
variation in gene dosage will be implemented across dozens of isogenic cell lines, each representing
haploinsufficiency in a different high-confidence IDD-related gene, to identify convergent mechanisms of IDD."
10754876,"The life-long production of blood cells requires hematopoietic developmental programs guided by systemic and
local signals to convey the dynamic need for these cells. How these signals are delivered within the intra-medullar
niches remain poorly understood. Extensive published and to-be-published information by the PIs of this
Program, collaborative and individually, clearly established the involvement of glycans in the guidance of
hematopoietic progenitor cell fate, function, and especially in thrombopoiesis and platelet functionality. The
overarching hypothesis is “cell-intrinsic and extrinsic glycan-mediated mechanisms regulate maintenance,
differentiation, and function of hematopoietic cells.” Project 1 will investigate the roles of the
galactosyltransferase β4GalT1, β1 integrin, and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)/heparan sulfate proteoglycans
(HSPGs) in thrombopoiesis at steady-state and following myeloablative stress using novel combined shared
“omics” and standard approaches with Project 3. A previously unknown role of β4GalT1 to regulate
megakaryocyte (MK) expression of HSPGs will also be investigated. A functionally defined MK-biased
hematopoietic stem cell will be investigated together with Project 2, especially with respect to the heavily α2,6-
sialylated cell surface despite the absence of St6gal1 expression necessary to generate this structure. Project
2 will investigate the role of extracellular glycosylation, especially that mediated by extrinsic ST6GAL1 using the
combined “omics” approach (Project 1), how extrinsic sialylation in the hematopoietic niche is regulated,
identifying the cell surface targets of sialylation; and with Project 3, understanding how the newly discovered
GAG cofactor modulates extrinsic ST6GAL1 activity. Clinical Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) and
Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPN) and preclinical mouse models will be used in a first-time assessment into
the glycobiology of these marrow diseases of highly heterogenous presentations but with the commonality of
dysplastic MKs and altered platelet numbers and function, and analysis of these clinical diseases is shared
across all three Projects. Project 3 will investigate the structure–function relationships of GAGs with proteins
within the marrow microenvironment, such as growth factors and their receptors, and glycosyltransferases. Their
roles in promoting thrombopoiesis and cell fate decisions will be interrogated using a multi-dimensional approach
to identifying distinct GAG sequences. Project 3 will discover synthetic GAG mimetics as modulators of
hematopoiesis/thrombopoiesis for therapeutic use. Core A will oversee the administration of the program, Core
B will provide generation and sequencing of cDNA libraries derived from bulk RNA samples and single cells, and
Core C will perform comparative structural analysis of GAGs, proteomics and protein-GAG interactions, and
quantitative proteomics of protein expression. The three projects are intimately intertwined and will use all Cores.
This program will uncover novel information to increase platelet production and help understand clinical
conditions characterized by MK abnormalities."
10819522,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 A properly functioning and effective immune system is needed to control infection by bacterial, viral and
other pathogen invaders, growth of aberrant cells, as well as for proper embryonic development, wound healing,
bone remodeling, and other normal homeostatic processes. Thus, understanding the innate and adaptive
immune responses and how abnormalities affect human health in chronic inflammatory conditions, during
neonatal development and how infectious diseases and cancers subvert or alter these responses is critical to
improving our health, not only in the United States, but globally. Closer to home, this unfortunately remains
especially true in the state of Louisiana, which ranks near the bottom in many national health studies. For
example, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) age adjusted deaths in the state are more than double the
national average, while the state ranks in the top 5 in infections with the sexually transmitted diseases, Syphilis,
Gonorrhea and Chlamydia. In addition, as is documented for many states in the south, Louisiana has some of
the highest rates of arthritis (affecting ~1 in 4 adults in the state), heart disease and cardiovascular deaths
(ranked 46/50 and 48/50 respectively), and cancer-related mortality rates (15-20% higher than the national
average) in the nation. These glaring statistics support the need for additional understanding of the pathogenesis
of these diseases and new options for therapeutic interventions. One common theme among these different
diseases is an aberrant immune response and resulting immunopathologies. Thus, we propose a better
understanding of how aberrations in the immune system result in disease is needed. We propose that a targeted
growth of an immunology-centric center on our campus at LSUHSC-S will positively influence the health of our
citizens. This is especially true as new research shows targeted modifications of the immune response or
immunotherapy holds great promise as an effective treatment option to control and eradicate various tumors, for
the treatment and mitigation of antibiotic or antiviral resistant infectious diseases, and for the prevention of
chronic inflammatory diseases, etc.
 Diverse research into aspects of immunology, host pathogen interactions, and the immunopathology
associated with an abnormal immune response is an important priority at LSU Health Sciences Center
Shreveport (LSUHSC-S) within multiple centers and departments. Immunology as a discipline can effectively
bridge many centers and departments currently on campus and thus serve as a nucleus for collaborative and
synergistic research across diverse disciplines. Immunology as a discipline is now at the forefront of novel
therapies to control bacterial infections, viral infections, to treat cancer; thus an expansion and growth of this
area at LSUHSC-S will advance the mission of the school to grow basic science that has strong translational
potential. The objective of this new COBRE Center for Applied Immunology and Pathological Processes
(CAIPP) to establish an independent internationally recognized research and training program at
LSUHSC-S. We propose to first mentor and develop federally funded junior faculty research and to develop
new infrastructure to support the growth and continued hiring in this important area of biomedical science.
Because Dr. Yurochko has 35 years of experience in immunology research, has been a junior PI in a COBRE
center, Project Mentor for successful projects and part of a COBRE leadership team, he can draw on a wealth
of experiences, along with those of the experienced leadership team, to drive the success of the CAIPP. Second,
we propose long term to retain these immunology researchers as they become more senior through promotion,
to become an international recognized research hub and to elevate the CAIPP within LSUHSC-S by becoming
a state recognized Center. We shall take advantage of the strengths currently on campus and through targeted
recruitment to grow the CAIPP COBRE around the focused understanding of “aberrant immune cell function and
the resulting immunopathology”. The cores address critical research needs on campus and are ultimately
essential for the long-term growth and status of research at LSUHSC-S. The cores build upon existing equipment
and infrastructure and bring new expertise not currently available on campus; thus, they fill a needed gap in
research infrastructure. Recent polling of the faculty document that all centers and most faculty (>80%) on
campus will utilize/require both proposed cores to generate the needed new data for competitive national grant
submissions. In summary, the major goals of this CAIPP COBRE application are to: establish a strong and
consistent mentorship and professional development program that meet the individual needs of each investigator
(and thus are tailored for the needs of that investigator); establish advanced research core facilities that support
the university, the region and the state; advance the mechanistic and clinical understanding for how subversion
of the immune response and functioning of immune cells influences human health and disease; and lastly to
create an academically and financially independent and internationally recognized Center of Excellence. We
support these major goals through our initial collaboration within centers and departments within the school and
the entire northern region of the state and to then grow this collaboration through engagement and collaborations
with colleagues in the rest of the state once we have established the foundation of the proposed CAIPP."

The Karmanos Cancer Institute (KCI), founded in 1943, is a not-for-profit, cancer-only research and patient
care organization in partnership with Wayne State University (WSU) in Michigan. The designation by the NCI
as a Comprehensive Cancer Center was achieved in 1978. KCI operates its wholly-owned, free-standing,
cancer hospital and ambulatory clinics (KCC) in Detroit and in Farmington Hills, a suburban location. As a
member of McLaren Health Care (MHC), a not-for profit health care corporation, KCI is also responsible for
cancer research, quality of care, and cancer care operations in all facilities owned and operated by MHC. Our
catchment area covers 46 of Michigan’s 83 counties with a population of 6.7 million people. This catchment
area is home to 95% of our patients, and KCI sees one-third of all new cancer patients in the catchment area.
The Southeast region of our catchment area includes the metropolitan Detroit, defined as a tri-county area
(Wayne, Oakland, Macomb) and home to 3.86 million residents. The city of Detroit is the largest city in the
state (672,000 residents). Detroit is a resource-challenged area, with a median household income of $27,838
and 37.9% of residents living below poverty level, compared to 16.7% in the state of Michigan. The majority of
census tracts in the city of Detroit are medically underserved areas based on HRSA definitions. About 79% of
Detroit residents identify as African American, a group that disproportionately carries KCI catchment area’s
cancer burden.
In 2018, KCI physicians saw approximately 12,000 new cancer patients (including approximately 8,000 analytic
cases), with approximately 15% representing minority groups. The annual number of new cancer cases in
these 46 counties is approximately 39,000 and has not changed significantly since 2014. In FY19, our minority
accrual to interventional treatment protocols was 24.2%. We have a long standing scientific and patient care
commitment to the African American population of southeastern Michigan, as exemplified in the broad array of
studies focused on molecular, therapeutic, and social disparities. This application profiles the strengths and
successes of our four scientific Programs, Tumor Biology and Microenvironment (TBM, 01), Molecular
Imaging (MI, 02), Molecular Therapeutics (MT, 03), and Population Studies and Disparities Research
(PSDR, 04). The research efforts of these Programs is supported by nine Shared Resources (Cores),
including one developing Core. As of December 2019, KCI’s 135 scientific members have secured total
annual direct project funding of $ 63,162,159 (an increase of 12.3% from 2015) of which $21,864,688 is peer
reviewed funding and $11,743,830 is from the NCI."
10758003,"Project Summary
Millions of low-income older adults require long-term services and supports (LTSS) but coverage of LTSS by
Medicare and private insurance is limited, leaving Medicaid as the primary payer for LTSS. In an effort to
respect people's preference for aging in place and to save costs, state Medicaid programs have turned to
policies designed to increase the use of home- and community-based services (HCBS), as an alternative to
nursing home care. Under this push towards HCBS, people with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias
(ADRD) have increasing opportunities to receive Medicaid HCBS. We propose to investigate HCBS use, health
outcomes, and health care costs among people with ADRD, particularly those with both Medicare and
Medicaid coverage.
Although HCBS use has increased nationwide for the past decades, HCBS use rates vary substantially across
states, suggesting the potential importance of state policies to encourage HCBS use. For example, state
Medicaid programs have different financial/functional eligibility and enrollment caps for HCBS users. However,
little is known about how these elements of state policies are associated with HCBS use. As state Medicaid
programs strive to increase HCBS use, there is a need for robust evidence about how different state Medicaid
policies are associated with HCBS use for people with ADRD.
Despite state Medicaid programs' push towards HCBS, these type of services may not be optimal for all people
with ADRD. HCBS use may meet people's preference for aging in place, but as people's ADRD progresses,
they may need more intensive round-the-clock care. Therefore, HCBS use for these people may lead to lower-
intensity care than needed, worse health outcomes, and higher health care costs (as a result of worse health
outcomes).
Our long-term goal is to identify elements of state Medicaid HCBS policies associated with an increase in
HCBS use by people with ADRD as well as to assess when HCBS is appropriately used to keep them safe in
the community. This proposal has four aims. First, we describe any use of HCBS, health outcomes
(hospitalization, emergency department visits, and falls), and health care costs for people with ADRD over time
(2016-2020) and across states. Second, we assess the association of state Medicaid HCBS policies with any
use of HCBS among people with ADRD. Third, we assess the effect of HCBS use on health outcomes for
people with ADRD across different levels of health status. Fourth, we assess the effect of HCBS use on health
care costs for people with ADRD across different levels of health status.
The proposed research will provide critical information about HCBS use, health outcomes, and health care
costs for people with ADRD. This knowledge will help inform state Medicaid policymakers who are seeking the
most effective approach towards HCBS and ultimately improve health outcomes for people with ADRD."
10903765,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a very common and lethal cancer in Africa, and as patients with HIV live
longer, the HCC burden may increase. In prior studies, our team identified chronic infection with hepatitis B
and C viruses (HBV, HCV), HIV and Schistosomiasis mansoni as independent risk factors for HCC. Compared
to the US, HCC in sub-Saharan Africa occurs at younger age and more advanced stage with survival of only
months. Proposed is an East and West African partnership between colleagues at Makerere University in
Uganda, Fann University in Senegal and Johns Hopkins University focused on HIV and hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) in Africa: The H2A Consortium. Building on long-standing collaborative research, mentoring
and clinical activities in both countries, our overarching goal is to reduce the heavy burden of HCC in sub-
Saharan Africa. We advocate investigating cancer interception strategies using appropriate medical treatments
to interrupt or reverse the impact of these HCC-causing infections. We will accomplish this objective by
developing local capacity and performing important research. Consortium activities are designed to enhance
both the clinical, population and translational research infrastructure and individual African investigator capacity
to conduct high-level, collaborative investigation of HIV, chronic infections and HCC. First, we will form a large,
prospective cohort of HBV and HBV/HIV co-infected persons to define who needs HBV treatment, determine
clinical responses, and characterize breakthrough HCC, while investigating novel biomarkers. To understand
our data demonstrating synergistic interaction between chronic HBV and Sm infections, we will examine HBV
clinical and immunological responses in the periphery and the liver in response to Sm treatment. HIV is
investigated as a key modifier of these relationships in both projects. Integrated within our scientific agenda,
early-stage African investigators will be provided mentoring and career development support while conducting
a collaborative pilot project leveraging Consortium resources. The impact of our integrated research and
capacity development activities will be establishment of the H2A Consortium as partnered Centers of
Excellence on HIV and HCC in East and West Africa."
10828720,"Overall Project Summary
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affects 5.8 million people in the United States, and is an immense
burden on patients, caregivers and on the economy. No disease-modifying treatments or
preventions exist, and we need better understanding of the disease and new therapeutic
strategies. Genetic discoveries are one source of candidate therapeutic targets. One source of
genetic targets is the Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP), a National Institute on
Aging (NIA) initiative since 2012 to sequence genomes and exomes of AD subjects and
cognitively normal elderly controls.
The Genome Center for Alzheimer’s Disease (GCAD) is the analysis coordinating center for the
ADSP. In the previous grant cycle, GCAD processed all AD-relevant sequencing data producing
harmonized genetic data for AD research. This renewal responds to the increase in the amount
and complexity of ADSP sequence data, the collection of new types of data, and an expansion
of the types of analysis being performed. In addition to sequence data, GCAD will harmonize
functional genomics data. GCAD will provide fully quality-controlled and annotated genetic and
functional genomics data that is analysis ready. In addition to AD, GCAD will also work with
data for AD related disorders (ADRD). These include frontotemporal dementias (FTDs),
progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), Lewy body dementia
(LBD), and Parkinson’s disease with dementia (PD-d).
In the Y6-10 funding period, GCAD will assemble and harmonize whole-genome/whole-exome
sequencing data, and provide it to ADSP investigators and the general scientific community.
GCAD will work with US and non-US groups to analyze data by fostering a collaborative
environment, and providing infrastructure support. GCAD will also assemble and harmonize
functional genomics data which will be integral to identifying genes as candidate drug targets.
The research plan will lead to a high quality, comprehensive, harmonized collection of genetic
and functional data with detailed supporting resources including documentation and optimized
computer codes. This resource will be invaluable for the entire AD research community."
10915494,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: The Eunice Kennedy Shriver Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities
Research Center at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM IDDRC) has been instrumental in advancing basic
science, translational, and clinical endeavors to improve the lives of individuals with intellectual and
developmental disability (IDD). Beyond discoveries, the Center has mentored more than two generations of
scientists and physicians engaged in research and the care and treatment of individuals with IDD. The mission
of the BCM IDDRC is to identify as many causes of IDD as possible, to understand their pathogenesis, and to
develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. To realize this mission, accelerate the research
activities of our Investigators and advance development of therapeutics for IDD, we will carry out the following
aims: 1) Provide Core facilities and services to advance IDD research. Six cores are proposed to provide
innovative, high-quality and cost-effective research services to assist investigators in studies of molecules
(Molecular and Expression Analysis), cells and tissues (Cell and Tissue Pathogenesis), circuits (Circuit
Analysis and Modulation), and whole organisms (Preclinical and Clinical Outcomes). The Clinical
Translational Core will provide services specific for clinical research infrastructure and the Center
Administration Core will coordinate overall Center operations along with stakeholder engagement,
communication and education; 2) Promote and enhance collaborative efforts and dissemination activities
with a comprehensive engagement, communication, and education plan. The Admin Core will promote
interactions locally, nationally, and internationally, will implement best practices for community partnerships
and dissemination of research findings, and will enhance the training of next-generation IDD
researchers; 3) Conduct a multidisciplinary signature research project that leads to clinical trial
readiness. The emergence of DNA-based therapies, coupled with exciting discoveries and preclinical studies
from the BCM IDDRC, provides exciting opportunities to treat IDDs, but the fact that many IDD-causing genes
are dosage sensitive (too much or too little is detrimental) poses a serious challenge requiring robust biological
markers meaningful for the individual rather than the population. The Signature Project seeks to develop
multidimensional biomarkers (molecules and circuits) for target engagement, safety, and efficacy in six gene
dosage dependent IDDs. The Center will support 75 investigators and 72 research projects. For 30+ years the
BCM IDDRC has had a profound impact on IDD, elucidating causes, determining mechanisms, and developing
interventions. It has fostered an environment that welcomes and supports additional investigators and
emphasizes training. As we enter the next decade, Center investigators, their collaborators, and trainees are
poised to transform dozens of exciting discoveries into safe therapeutics that will improve the quality of life and
well-being of individuals with IDD."
10850826,"PROJECT SUMMARY (APOE U19: OVERALL)
The overarching goal of this U19 project is to comprehensively understand the biology and pathobiology of
apolipoprotein E (apoE) in aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) to inform therapeutic strategies. The ε4 allele of
the APOE gene (APOE4) is the strongest genetic risk factor for AD impacting 50-70% of all AD patients, while
the ε2 allele is protective compared to the common ε3 allele. APOE4 is also a strong risk factor for age-related
cognitive decline and vascular cognitive impairment. To integrate existing knowledge and address critical gaps,
we propose a unified ApoE Cascade Hypothesis that the structural differences and related biochemical
properties among the three apoE isoforms initiate their differential effects on a cascade of events at the cellular
and systems levels ultimately impacting aging-related pathogenic conditions including AD. Towards this, we
have assembled a multi-disciplinary team to synergize expertise and resources across multiple institutions. By
integrating five interactive Projects and seven robust Cores, we will create a nexus for apoE-related aging
research, sharing the knowledge, expertise and resources with the broader scientific community. Project 1 will
work closely with Core B to address the structural and biochemical properties of the three apoE isoforms to
generate insights for functional outcomes. Projects 2, 3 and 4 will interactively study how apoE isoforms
expressed in astrocytes, microglia, or vascular mural cells impact lipid metabolism, glial and vascular functions,
AD-related pathologies, and cellular and molecular pathways using conditional mouse models and systems-
based approaches. These studies will generate cell type-specific apoE/lipoprotein particles that will be
collected through in vivo microdialysis for structural and biochemical studies. Project 5 will carry out genomic
and genetic analyses to identify modifiers of APOE-related age at onset of AD. Studies in Projects 2-5 will be
interactively supplemented by neuropathological studies using postmortem brains from healthy aging studies
or with AD pathologies (Core C), biomarker studies using both human and mouse biospecimens (Core D), and
functional studies using human iPSC-derived cellular and organoid models (Core E). This U19 proposal is
supported by a comprehensive Multi-Omics Core (Core F) for centralized proteomics, lipidomics, and
metabolomics studies on various animal and iPSC models, as well as human postmortem brains and fluid
biospecimens. The Bioinformatics, Biostatistics, and Data Management Core (Core G) will provide critical
supports for analyzing large datasets including those from single-cell RNA-seq and biostatistics supports to
ensure scientific rigor. Core G will also work closely with the Administrative Core (Core A) to maintain an ApoE
Web Portal designated as EPAAD where knowledge, resources, and data will be shared with the scientific
community. Core A will also organize annual ApoE Symposium to promote collaboration and engage the ApoE
Community. As such, this U19 will drive a team-based effort to generate essential knowledge to guide disease-
modifying therapies for AD and other aging-related conditions."

Center for Bio-behavioral Mechanisms of Eating Behavior
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
We propose to establish a Center for Bio-behavioral Mechanisms of Eating Behavior (CBM-EB) at Sanford
Research, Fargo along with the University of North Dakota School of Medicine and North Dakota State
University (NDSU). The proposed CBM-EB will initially consist of five thematically related research projects
focusing on mechanisms related to eating disorders and maladaptive eating behavior. To support the Project
Directors of each these five research projects, we will propose a Research Assessment Services Core
comprised of a wide array of assessment methodologies that could be innovatively integrated in eating related
research, including assessment modalities in the area of psychopathology assessment, biological assays,
neuroimaging and neurobiological assessment, eating behavior assessment, and cognitive assessment. In
addition to these core research assessment methodologies, we propose a Biomedical Statistics Core to
promote scientifically valid and appropriate data collection and analyses for the study of mechanistic
processes, as well as a Human Subjects Core to support Project Directors management of regulatory
aspects of human subjects research. Additionally, we propose a Clinical Research Training Program which
integrates seminars, colloquia, and close mentorship to enhance the development of our entry level
investigators. We believe that these resources will facilitate transition of our Project Directors to independent
investigators who conduct clinically relevant research."
10767926,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The musculoskeletal system has both mechanical and biological functions—it generates, transmits, and
supports forces, and it regulates organ-level homeostasis and whole-body metabolism. The mechanics and
biology of the musculoskeletal system are inextricably intertwined and long-ranging, where mechanical cues,
molecular signals, and cell interactions affect each other across multiple scales, from the body, to organ, tissue,
cell, and molecule levels. Progress in musculoskeletal research depends on addressing the mechanics and
biology of adjacent organs, and evaluating the effects of injury as well as aging. Identifying the mechanisms
underlying musculoskeletal health and musculoskeletal disorders (e.g., osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, muscle
wasting, post-traumatic repair, degeneration) therefore requires a research paradigm that addresses the
synergies within the musculoskeletal system and combines both mechanical and biological approaches across
multiple scales.
 The Delaware Center for Musculoskeletal Research (DCMR) will support basic and preclinical
research on the central theme of musculoskeletal health—from the level of the entire body to the actions
of key cells and molecules—with emphasis on understanding the mechanisms by which physical and
biological cues influence tissue structure and normal function and dysfunction, and identifying potential
therapeutic interventions. The proposed DCMR will:
Aim 1: Accelerate fundamental musculoskeletal research by supporting synergistic and multidisciplinary
 Research Projects.
Aim 2: Galvanize capabilities for musculoskeletal research by establishing a Multiscale Assessments
 Research Core.
Aim 3: Amplify the impact of musculoskeletal research through faculty mentoring, expansion, and retention.
 Completion of this 5-year Phase I COBRE will build cross-cutting and synergistic research collaborations
across multi-scale and multidisciplinary Research Projects and establish a state-of-the-art Research Core. The
DCMR, which will focus on fundamental discovery and preclinical research, will complement the outstanding
translational and clinical musculoskeletal research programs at Delaware, creating a comprehensive basic-to-
clinical research pipeline at UD. Through fostering cross-cutting and convergent research partnerships, the
DCMR aims to substantially reduce the burden of musculoskeletal disorders and improve musculoskeletal
health."

The University of North Carolina Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center (IDDRC) is an
interdisciplinary program with the overarching goal of supporting and promoting research relevant to
understanding the pathogenesis and treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders. The UNC IDDRC is a critical
component of the new Carolina Institute for Developmental Disabilities (CIDD), which is the focal point for
clinical services, research, and training relevant to intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs) on the
UNC campus. The UNC IDDRC currently supports 46 investigators from 13 University departments, and
includes 89 externally-funded research projects. The broad-based research program of this IDDRC is
integrated around 3 themes: (1) Brain and Behavior Development; (2) Autism and Related
Neurodevelopmental Disorders; and, (3) Early Detection/Intervention. The UNC IDDRC is a highly
collaborative program highlighted by the presence of several NIH-funded, interdisciplinary research
centers/programs. This application seeks support for: (1) an Administrative Core; (2) three research cores –
the Clinical Translational Core, which includes the Research Participant Registry and Brain-Behavior
Measurement Laboratory; the PreClinical Core, which includes the Mouse Behavioral Phenotyping Laboratory,
Neuroscience Microscopy Facility, and Small Animal Imaging Facility; the Data Science Core Core; and (3) a
pre-clinical/clinical research project entitled “Cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities in neurodevelopmental
disorders” that proposes to examine role of CSF pathophysiology in the pathogenesis of selected
neurodevelopmental disorders. The three proposed research cores provide cutting-edge, high-quality and cost
effective support for this integrated, multidisciplinary, translational program of IDD-relevant research. Overall,
this Center has had a major impact on developmental disabilities research and scientific training at the
University of North Carolina, and renewal would allow us to continue our support of the truly exceptional
program of IDD research conducted at UNC."
10915519,"This proposal requests 5 years of additional funding for the UCLA Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities
Research Center (IDDRC). For over 40 years, our mission has been to provide an optimal environment for
conducting multidisciplinary research into the mechanisms underlying intellectual and developmental disabilities
(IDDs), to translate these findings into effective treatments for IDDs, and disseminate these findings to the
scientific community and the public. This submission expands on the translational focus that we began 5 years
ago with an added emphasis on human research and clinical trials, and closer ties to the community. Each of
the 5 cores are structured to facilitate interdisciplinary collaborations, following four thematic goals: 1) providing
state of the art infrastructure for IDD related research; 2) encourage innovation by supporting technical
development and providing financial incentives for new projects; 3) promote integration across disciplines, by
encouraging interdisciplinary research among faculty and between cores; and 4) to disseminate advances in

stakeholders in community outreach efforts. We propose 5 interacting cores: A: Administration and
Dissemination, which oversees core functions and usage, assures quality and accountability, and promotes
outreach and dissemination; B: Clinical Translation, supporting clinical trials, recruitment, diagnosis and deep
phenotyping, and biosample collection; C: Genetics, Genomics and BioInformatics, which performs genetic
analysis, sequencing, expression, and provides resources for planning and executing analysis of genomics data;
D: Cells, Circuits and Systems, supporting human iPSC and 3-dimensional organoid development, in- and ex-
vivo electrophysiology and optogenetics; and E: Structural and Functional Visualization, which provides training,
access, and analysis services for in vitro microscopy, mini-cameras for in vivo visualization, animal and human
structural and functional MRI and spectroscopy. Our model research project focuses on mechanisms underlying
sleep impairments in two IDDs, building on new findings from our last submission: a near absence of slow-wave
sleep in Dup15q syndrome. We will examine mechanisms underlying sleep impairments in Dup15q and Rett's
Syndrome using a multidisciplinary approach that includes a clinical component, animal models, and brain
organoid model using patient-derived IPSCs, to elucidate how mechanisms underlying altered sleep physiology
lead to cognitive dysfunction. Results from this project will directly inform next steps for developing interventions
that may modulate sleep and, in turn, neurodevelopment in IDDs."
10843801,"OVERALL PROJECT ABSTRACT
Indigenous populations experience significant trauma-related health disparities, including addiction, post-
traumatic stress disorder, chronic diseases, infant mortality, and suicide. Many of these disparities are worse
for American Indians (AIs) in the Dakotas. AI communities also contend with historical and intergenerational
trauma from decades of traumatic losses and forced assimilation. Hence, we will establish the Indigenous
Trauma & Resilience Research Center at UND to address the health impact of unresolved trauma and the
protective factors of cultural connectedness and resilience. The Center will consist of three interrelated
research projects—each led by an early career investigator and assisted by senior scientist mentors.
Objectives:
1. Establish a nationally-recognized and acclaimed Indigenous Trauma & Resilience Research Center at
 UND with a goal to improve AI health and well-being.
2. Provide support and mentoring to the Project Leaders to enable future success in obtaining R01 funding.
3. Establish Administrative, Community Engagement & Outreach, and Human Subjects Cores that will
 support the Center and will provide services to strengthen research capacity to address Indigenous health.
Methods: Three research projects include: (1) Historical trauma and resilience as a biological state and its
association with the effects of the traditional Indigenous food chokeberry; (2) Impact of boarding school
attendance on perceived stress, allostatic load and resilience; and (3) Stress and health in American Indian
pregnancies. We will leverage existing assets at UND, including several Institutional Development Award
(IDeA) programs. Mentoring will be provided to support the project leaders through an Administrative Core
consisting of the Program Director/Principal Investigator (PD/PI), Internal and External Advisory Committees,
and a group of high-level scientific Project Mentors. Each project leader will use community-based,
participatory research principles and will complete the Tribal Community Engagement Training Module that
was developed by the PD/PI. A Community Engagement & Outreach Core will be led by Dr. Melanie
Nadeau of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians from ND. Cultural considerations for human subjects
research and collection of biological samples will be supported by a Human Subjects Core that will provide
technical assistance regarding research compliance and addressing cultural norms. Significant opportunities
exist for meta-scholarship in which COBRE stakeholders will publish best and promising practices to support
community-engaged human subjects research with Indigenous populations. The center will be sustainable and
competitive for numerous other grant programs, including Research Project Grants (R01) and related funding."
11074908,"Project Summary/Abstract
Fibrotic activity, the accumulation of macromolecules, alters the composition and microstructural organization
musculoskeletal connective tissue. The ability to non-invasively quantify and characterize the significant
extracellular matrix components such as proteoglycan content and collagen fibrils organization is important
clinically since fibrosis is a common inflammatory response that plays a role in many pathologies. Recent
advances in instrumentation for low field magnetic resonance (MR) has enabled its adoption in the field of
macromolecular characterization, porous media, and recently biological tissues. LF MR is advantageous as an
affordable non-cryogen alternative to high-field MR imaging with a greater detectable dynamic range of
quantitative MR parameters. This adaptation for this imaging modality is limited by the lack of appropriate
phantoms of connective tissue and the identification of biomarkers for healthy and diseased tissue. Composite
gels that replicate the salient structural and compositional features of connective tissue will be developed and
used to optimize low field MR methods and identify LF biomarkers. These methods will be applied to articular
cartilage and lumbodorsal fascia connective tissues. The project is anticipated to have a significant positive
impact on the clinical capability and utility of LF MR as an affordable point of care diagnostic application."
11169328,"PROJECT SUMMARY.
Despite knowing for more than 60 years that three copies of chromosome 21 (chr21, T21) is the genetic cause
of Down syndrome (DS), we still know relatively little about how T21 drives the vast majority of DS
pathophysiology. Over the last several decades, alterations in the response to diverse environmental stress
conditions, such as oxidative stress, the unfolded protein response, the integrated stress response, and immune
signaling, have been identified in T21 cells and mouse models of DS. Indeed, we have shown that the interferon
(IFN) response is constitutively active in T21 cells, leading to an interferonopathy-like state of global immune
dysregulation, likely due to the presence of four IFN receptors (IFNRs) in a single locus on chr21. Recently, we
identified the IFNR locus as a target of directed transient site-specific gene amplification (TSSG) in response to
viral infection. Importantly, we found that while the IFNR cluster is subject to TSSG in healthy cells, this process
is impaired in T21 cells. These TSSGs arise from DNA rereplication events that are normally regulated by
epigenetic changes to chromatin structure. Our prior work determined that DNA rereplication and TSSG are part
of cellular responses to myriad environmental stress, including hypoxia, UPR, and heavy metal exposure,
implicating dysregulation of DNA rereplication as a potential common element in the altered stress responses of
T21 cells.
This project will test the transformative hypothesis that dysregulated DNA rereplication in response to
cellular stress contributes to the development of T21 and subsequent pathophysiology of DS.
The potential impact of this hypothesis is profound. Not only could the dysregulation of IFNR TSSG affect the
response to immune activation and pathogen response, it is entirely possible that other stress response-
mediated TSSGs are also impaired, with subsequent effects on systemic biology. Furthermore, recent studies
have shown that extrachromosomal DNA can lead to missegregation of chromosomes, leading to our hypothesis
that virally-induced DNA rereplication of the IFNR locus during gamete development could promote
missegregation of chr21 leading to T21.
Given the novelty of our observation and hypothesis, this proposal seeks to answer a number of questions
regarding TSSG in T21 including: 1) How do T21 cells suppress TSSG of the IFNR locus? 2) Do T21 cells
fail to initiate rereplication at other stress-induced TSSGs? 3) Do T21 cells have a different DNA
rereplication program? and 4) How might amplification of the IFNR locus contribute to missegregation
events that lead to T21?
Using a combination of cell culture models from humans and mice and a novel mouse in vitro fertilization model,

rereplication may contribute to the development of T21 and pathophysiology of DS."
10907665,"Over the last six years our project teams have demonstrated that neurophysiology abnormalities
are conserved across mice and humans in fragile X syndrome (FXS). These findings across
species provide a great opportunity to advance mechanistic understanding of clinically relevant
illness features and develop translational biomarkers and aid treatment discovery. These
advances can bridge the significant chasm between preclinical and clinical success in new
treatment development. We take mechanistic approaches to determining the drivers of
neurophysiology dysregulation across three integrated projects spanning human, in vivo, and ex
vivo mouse study. This allows for levels of analysis from whole brain network modeling to
microcircuit and molecular analysis to aid target discovery while improving translational
medicine efforts in FXS. In doing this we place emphasis on recognizing heterogeneity within
FXS and using this understanding to model how to best interpret and link preclinical and clinical
study. Out of this appreciation of the challenges to translational efforts in our field, we have
developed a synchronized approach to the analysis and interpretation of neurophysiology data
ensuring comparable results across research platforms. The striking consistency of findings
across levels of investigation and species offers an unprecedented opportunity to investigate
mechanisms of brain dysfunction across mouse and human study thus significantly improving
opportunities for translational medicine development in FXS- a multidisciplinary mission that is
ideal for a Center environment. Project 1 (Erickson/Sweeney; Cincinnati) will conduct human
FXS neurophysiology, behavior, and pharmacological probe studies to pursue advanced
neurophysiology modeling of cortical hyperexcitability and abnormal response to stimuli while
also seeking to resolve heterogeneity across FXS in humans. Project 2 (Binder/Razak;
Riverside) will develop translational neurophysiological biomarkers for FXS in the Fmr1 KO
mouse using both surface and depth multi-electrode array technology. Project 3 (Huber/Gibson,
UTSW) will investigate the microcircuit and molecular mechanisms of neurophysiologic
dysregulation in the Fmr1 KO mouse. All Projects will examine candidate mechanisms of
neurophysiologic dysregulation with a pharmacological probe strategy to test mechanisms of
interest in parallel studies of mice and patients."
10875743,"SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other dementias are a substantial and rapidly growing societal burden due to the
aging of our population. This aging has occurred in part because modern medicine has identified risk factors
and treatments for many other diseases, but not for AD. Thus there is a great and unmet need to do so. A
hallmark symptom of AD and aging without dementia is impaired memory, including retrieval. Further, some of
the earliest neuropathology found in AD is within the systems that provide the neuromodulators dopamine (DA)
and norepinephrine (NE) to the brain (including the hippocampus, a center for declarative/episodic memory).
The largest brainstem adrenergic nucleus is the locus coeruleus (LC), which supplies all of the NE and a
substantial portion of the DA found in the dorsal hippocampus. The LC can also be affected in normal aging.
As such, the goal of this proposal is to better understand the roles and mechanisms by which LC-derived DA
and NE modulate the encoding and retrieval of declarative/episodic memory. Toward this goal, pharmacologic
and genetic manipulations will be performed in rodents, for which there are excellent behavioral paradigms that
rely on hippocampus-dependent memory. Our preliminary studies indicate that all three -adrenergic receptors
that are activated by NE play a critical role in the hippocampus to promote memory retrieval. They also suggest
that adrenergic DA is required for hippocampus-dependent memory. Thus the first aim will examine the
molecular and cellular mechanisms by which -adrenergic receptors promote hippocampus-dependent memory
using combined pharmacologic and genetic approaches. Subcellular localization of  receptors in the
hippocampus will also be determined. The second aim will examine the modulation of hippocampus-dependent
memory by “adrenergic” DA using combined pharmacologic and genetic approaches. The third aim will examine
the ability of drugs that enhance DA and NE signaling to promote memory in models of AD and aging. The
completion of these aims will provide a better understanding of how memory encoding and retrieval is facilitated
within the hippocampus, and ultimately may suggest potential targets for enhancing memory in AD and aging."
10875780,"Project Summary / Abstract
 Dementia and age-related cognitive decline is an escalating major health concern in the United States.
Approximately 20% of the US population will be 65 or older by year 2030, and roughly 8 million of these
individuals are expected to suffer from Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We propose to examine detailed AD-related
neural circuit mechanisms that will be critical for developing new AD treatment strategies by use of two
complementary AD mouse models, which share many features of human AD. Our guiding hypothesis is that
AD-related neurodegeneration causes maladaptive changes of memory circuit connections and neural ensemble
activities in the hippocampus. We discovered recently in the mouse that non-canonical subicular back-
projections to hippocampal CA1 underlie object-place learning, a prominent impairment in AD. This circuit has
been recently identified in human brain. We will test our hypothesis that significant impairments in bidirectional
information processing between hippocampal CA1 and the subiculum (SUB) develop over time during AD
progression. In Aim 1, we will determine the effect of AD-like neurodegeneration on local and global circuit
connections to hippocampal CA1 and SUB excitatory neurons. We will map and compare circuit input
connections and output projections of excitatory CA1 and SUB neurons in adult control, and AD-like mice using
retrograde monosynaptic rabies tracing and anterograde monosynaptic herpes simplex virus (HSV) tracing.
Further, we will perform experiments in postmortem human hippocampus of aged-matched control and AD
patients to map the SUB-CA1 pathway in human brains and understand detailed changes of this brain circuit in
AD patients. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that neurodegeneration in AD-like mice degrades object-
location memory encoded by hippocampal CA1 and SUB excitatory neurons. To map neuronal activity to
behavioral performance, we will use in vivo miniature microscopic imaging to examine and compare spatial
representations of CA1 excitatory neurons and SUB excitatory neurons during open-field exploration, track-
based route-running and object-location memory tasks. Thus, we can longitudinally track progressive AD-like
functional defects. In Aim 3, we will determine whether spatial memory can be rescued by patterned stimulation
of the non-canonical SUB-CA1 back-projection in the AD model mice. Human literature and our preliminary data
show high relevance of our proposed research for Alzheimer’s disease. Together, the proposed research will
advance our understanding of specific neural mechanisms underlying AD etiology and help to identify new
therapeutic targets in humans."
10907680,"Fragile X Premutations- Mechanisms and Modifiers
Fragile X-associated disorders are a heterogeneous group of conditions arising from alterations
in the size, content, and epigenetic state of a polymorphic CGG repeat within the FMR1 gene.
Described as the first repeat expansion disorder nearly 30 years ago, FMR1 CGG repeat
expansions are both an important cause of neurological, reproductive and neurodevelopmental
disease as well as an archetype for understanding repeat expansions and the mechanisms by
which they elicit dysfunction. Work over past decades delineated the native functions of the
fragile X protein, FMRP, and the consequences of its loss and the explored toxic gain-of
function mechanisms (RNA-mediated toxicity via protein sequestration, and protein mediated
toxicity from Repeat associated non-AUG (RAN) translation) elicited by transcribed CGG
repeats. Despite these efforts, we still lack effective therapies for any of the cardinal Fragile X-
associated disorders.
Here we propose a paradigm shift in our approach to FX associated disorders. Rather than
focusing solely on specific diseases (Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), fragile X-associated
tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), and fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency
(FXPOI)), the Center structure enables us to directly engage the mechanistic cross-talk between
conditions and between the FMR1 locus and related repeat expansion disorders. Our central
hypothesis is that a deeper understanding of genetic factors which underlie clinical disease
onset and penetrance in premutation associated disorders and an exploration of native CGG
repeat functions will reveal novel insights into both how repeats cause disease and how they
might be targeted therapeutically. Led by a multidisciplinary team featuring many leaders in the
Fragile X field, we will address this hypothesis in three cohesive projects all focused on
premutation disorders by using data-driven genomic and bioinformatics approaches coupled
with emerging tools and integrative model systems. By pooling our substantial data, expertise
and resources, we will pursue a deeper understanding of FX premutation pathogenic
mechanisms and define a series of robust and viable targets for therapeutic development
across Fragile X-associated disorders."
10890319,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive 
cognitive decline and dementia. Despite more than fifty years of research, no cures exist and the 
standard of treatment remains unsatisfactory. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) 
indicate that AD risk reflects both highly penetrant rare variants as well as common 
single nucleotide polymorphisms with small effect sizes. By overlapping GWAS and post-mortem 
and myeloid cell expression analyses, we have identified common variants with expression and 
splicing quantitative trait loci that may contribute to altered gene expression or alternative 
splicing; however, demonstrating which risk loci are the causal contributors to disease risk 
remains an intractable problem. Here, we will apply statistical approaches to prioritize putative 
causal variants in AD-associated loci by incorporating expanded AD GWAS functional annotations, 
single cell chromatin profiles and histone modification and microglia gene expression datasets. We 
will then apply a human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based approach to manipulate 
the genotype of prioritized putative causal AD risk variants that alter gene expression 
or alternative splicing of mRNAs, focusing largely on genes implicated in phagocytosis 
and lysosomal-autophagy function. Through isogenic comparisons of neurons, microglia, and 
astrocytes, we propose to examine the molecular and functional effects of perturbing five putative 
causal SNPs separately testing their cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous impact on cellular 
function. Our hope is that this work may identify novel therapeutic points of intervention in order 
to prevent or slow disease course in individuals with AD. This project will have a large overall 
impact by providing a mechanistic interpretation of genetic variants associated
with AD susceptibility."

10892337,"ABSTRACT
There is a pressing need for effective interventions to remediate age-related cognitive decline and alter the
trajectory toward Alzheimer’s disease. The NIA Alzheimer’s Disease Initiative funded Phase III Augmenting
Cognitive Training in Older Adults (ACT) trial aimed to demonstrate that transcranial direct current stimulation
(tDCS) paired with cognitive training could achieve this goal. The present study proposes a state of the art
secondary data analysis of ACT trial data that will further this aim by 1) elucidate mechanism of action underlying
response to tDCS treatment with CT, 2) address heterogeneity of response in tDCS augmented CT by determining
how individual variation in the dose of electrical current delivered to the brain interacts with individual brain
anatomical characteristics; and 3) refine the intervention strategy of tDCS paired with CT by evaluating methods
for precision delivery targeted dosing characteristics to facilitate tDCS augmented outcomes. tDCS intervention to
date, including ACT, apply a fixed dosing approach whereby a single stimulation intensity (e.g., 2mA) and set of
electrode positions on the scalp (e.g., F3/F4) is applied to all participants/patients. However, our recent work has
demonstrated that age-related changes in neuroanatomy as well as individual variability in head/brain structures
(e.g., skull thickness) significantly impacts the distribution and intensity of electrical current induced in the brain
from tDCS. This project will use person-specific MRI-derived finite element computational models of electric current
characteristics (current intensity and direction of current flow) and new methods for enhancing the precision and
accuracy of derived models to precisely quantify the heterogeneity of current delivery in older adults. We will
leverage these individualized precision models with state-of-the-art support vector machine learning methods to
determine the relationship between current characteristics and treatment response to tDCS and CT. We will
leverage the inherent heterogeneity of neuroanatomy and fixed current delivery to provide insight in the not only
which dosing parameters were associated with treatment response, but also brain region specific information to
facilitate targeted delivery of stimulation in future trials. Further still, the current study will also pioneer new methods
for calculation of precision dosing parameters for tDCS delivery to potentially optimize treatment response, as well
as identify clinical and demographic characteristics that are associated with response to tDCS and CT in older
adults. Leveraging a robust and comprehensive behavioral and multimodal neuroimaging data set for ACT with
advanced computational methods, the proposed study will provide critical information for mechanism,
heterogeneity of treatment response and a pathway to refined precision dosing approaches for remediating age-
related cognitive decline and altering the trajectory of older adults toward Alzheimer’s disease."
10884087,"Project Summary
With medical progress and growing efforts to empower individuals in making life-impacting choices, older
individuals are thus more engaged in their behavioral and socioeconomic choices than ever before. These
decisions are multifaceted and nuanced, but unfortunately, older adults often make poor socioeconomic
decisions. Progress in medicine has not only led to increased life expectancy but it has also contributed to a rise
in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, due to rapid increase in population aging and
the current absence of AD-modifying therapies. Exploiting recent advances in judgement and decision-making
neuroscience, we now propose a three-pronged effort designed to uncover whether and how Aβ-dependent
mechanisms induce changes in circuits underlying various forms of decision-making and we have formed an
investigative multi-PI team uniquely qualified to pursue these questions. Leveraging exciting new results from
our joint group, we will test the central hypothesis that decision-making in AD mice is altered in a multifaceted
economic- and sex-specific manner. In the light of novel findings reported in the preliminary results, we will i) test
the hypothesis that aging impairs decision-making differentially in male and female mice, ii) test the prediction
that decision-making is impaired in mouse models of AD and worsens with aging and iii) test the hypothesis that
genetic, pharmaceutical and optogenetic intervention will improve decision-making in AD mouse models, thereby
providing a preclinical proof-of-principle that decline in decision-making can be ameliorated."
10795707,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Neurons are capable of activating pathways that induce either the degeneration of the entire cell by
apoptosis or to selectively degenerate only the axons. Physiological axon-specific degeneration, known as axon
pruning, is important as it allows neurons to remove excessive or misguided axons and permit plasticity in
neuronal connections. Aberrant pruning is observed in several neurodegenerative diseases, including
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). However, exactly how neurons activate this pathway to degenerate axons in
physiological or pathological situations of AD is unclear.
 We have investigated the apoptosis and axon pruning pathways in a microfluidic chamber-based model
utilizing sympathetic neurons. Upon nerve growth factor (NGF) deprivation, these neurons can induce either
apoptosis (when NGF is deprived from both soma and axon compartments) or axon pruning (when NGF is
deprived from only the axon compartment). Our research has identified substantial overlap but also distinct
differences between the apoptosis and axon pruning pathways. For example, while caspase-9 (Casp9) and
caspase-3 (Casp3) are required for both pathways, their activation is dependent on the apoptosome during
apoptosis but is surprisingly independent of the apoptosome during axon pruning.
 While investigating the mechanism by which caspases are activated during pruning, we unexpectedly found
that the inflammasome pathway plays an important function in axon pruning. Inflammasomes have been
studied primarily in immune cells in the context of pathogen signaling. These are multi-protein complexes
formed in response to pathogenic or danger stimuli, which result in activation of the proinflammatory caspase,
caspase-1 (Casp1). Strikingly, we found that Casp1 and NLRP1 (a key component of a particular
inflammasome) are both essential for axon pruning. These results are surprising as axon pruning does not
involve pathogen exposure. In this proposal, we will identify the specific inflammasome pathway components
that are critical for axon pruning and conduct mechanistic experiments to define this novel function of NLRP1
in neurons. In Aim 1, we will define the specific inflammasome proteins that are essential for axon pruning,
and determine where they act in the known pruning pathway. In Aim 2, we will define the role of IL-1β/IL-18
in axon pruning. Our focus in Aim 3 will be to conduct mechanistic experiments to examine how NLRP1 is
activated in the context of axon pruning. Importantly, in Aim 4 we will focus on AD and investigate whether
the pathological degeneration of synapses and axons in AD are mediated by NLRP1. We will examine this in a
microfluidic model of Aβ-induced axon degeneration in vitro as well as in a mouse model of AD in vivo where
we will examine if NLRP1 deficiency reduces AD pathology and behavioral defects. This project opens an
exciting new avenue of research into this unexpected function of the NLRP1 inflammasome in neurons."

the-art genomics technologies for understanding the biology of the mammalian germ cell. More specifically, our
goal has been to understand the genetic, epigenetic, and epitranscriptomic basis for the generation of viable
healthy gametes and to explore how alterations in these events could contribute to human infertility. It is well
known that disruption of genes required for regulating all aspects of gene expression, including chromatin
modifiers, the transcription machinery, and components of post-transcriptional regulatory pathways, leads to the
formation of spermatozoa with abnormal head morphology in the mouse, while sperm from men with increased
abnormal sperm morphology significantly higher rates of chromosomal aneuploidy, chromatin compaction
defects, and altered transcriptome profiles compared to sperm from fertile men. Thus, in this application, we
seek to understand how transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and epitranscriptomic regulation of gene expression
and chromatin state contributes to the differentiation of haploid germ cells into mature spermatozoa. Three
projects are proposed and three cores are proposed. PROJECT I (Danko and Cohen) will focus on the
importance of transcriptional regulation of gene expression at the exit from meiosis and entry into
spermiogenesis, with a focus on the role of the bromodomain protein, BRDT in facilitating transcriptional
shutdown and thus permitting appropriate histone-to-protamine replacement and nuclear compaction.
PROJECT II (Grimson, Schimenti, Hwang) will focus on mechanisms and functions of post-transcriptional
processing and regulation of mRNAs during spermiogenesis and whether defects in these processes can
underlie defects in sperm morphology in patients seeking assisted reproductive technologies. PROJECT III
(Jaffrey) will explore the dynamics of N6-methyladenosine (M6A) and N6, 2’-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am)
modifications on RNA through spermatogenesis in mice and in men, and the importance of these
epitranscriptomic changes for the production of healthy sperm in mice and men. These studies will be supported
by a well-established ADMINISTRATIVE CORE (Cohen) that will facilitate close interactions through regular
meetings, trainee events, pilot and seed grants, and our popular “Tri-Repro” Annual Symposium. Our state-of-
the-art GENOME INNOVATION CORE (Grenier) will serve as an Innovation Hub for exploring all aspects of
gene regulation in reproduction, specializing in a range of next generation sequencing technologies to support
the projects. Finally, our OUTREACH CORE (Lin) will provide lab opportunities for nearby, and traditionally
underserved, school districts throughout upstate New York, at the same time sending our trainees and faculty
out to these communities as role models for young budding scientists. Our center will benefit from the strong

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an X-linked disorder of intellectual disability (ID) that is most commonly due to the
expansion of a CGG-repeat in the 5’-untranslated region of the FMR1 gene. CGG expansion beyond 200 repeats
leads to hypermethylation of the FMR1 promoter, resulting in the loss of FMR1 expression. FXS is thereby
caused by the loss of functional fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Over the course of nearly three
decades of research since the discovery of the FMR1 gene, much has been learned about the function of FMRP
and the consequence of its absence, primarily using mouse and fruit fly model systems. FMRP is a selective
RNA-binding protein associated with messenger ribonucleoprotein mRNPs and/or stalled polyribosomes that
appears to be involved in the regulation of local protein synthesis at synapses. The loss of FMRP leads to
dysregulated translation of selective mRNAs. Substantial progress in characterizing the underlying disease
mechanisms in animal models has led to highly successful preclinical studies of drugs modulating metabotropic
glutamate and GABA receptors. However, follow-up clinical trials in humans have been largely unsuccessful,
highlighting the imprecision of using the mouse model of FXS. Development of human iPSCs-derived monolayer
culture (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) organoid culture systems, which recapitulate key features of human
brain development, have provided a platform to model human development and disease, as well as to better
screen for therapeutic drugs. Little is known of FMRP-mediated regulation of human brain development or the
extent of its plasticity, which is essential to fully understand the pathophysiology of FXS. The overarching goal
of this Center is to take a systematic approach to investigate how FMRP may regulate human brain development
and circuit functions, and develop novel therapeutic approaches to treat FXS. Using our established human 2D
and 3D model systems as well as mouse models, we will determine the role of FMRP in human brain function
and systematically identify the functional mRNA targets of FMRP in human brain development and circuit
functions. We will also use these iPSC models as translational tools to develop novel therapeutic approaches
for FXS. The Center brings together an outstanding team of investigators with expertise in transcriptomic
analyses, genome-wide translation profiling (translatomes), FMRP-RNA interactomes, single cell genomics, cell
type-specific manipulations, dissection of activity- and circuit-dependent mechanisms, and high-throughput small
molecule screening. Our coordinated effort will create scientific synergy and significantly advance our
understanding of FMRP-mediated gene regulation in human brain development and circuit functions and enable
novel therapeutic development for fragile X syndrome."

10875776,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, affecting ~10% of the
population over 65 years of age. AD is a systemic disorder that affects the brain and
peripheral tissues. Patients with AD suffer from declined memory, cognitive deficits, and
changes in personality. In addition, AD is often associated with reduced muscle strength,
even at early stages. In some AD patients, muscle strength is reduced without loss of
muscle mass. However, pathological mechanisms of reduced muscle strength are not well
understood. Muscle contraction requires the efficient neurotransmission at the
neuromuscular junction (NMJ), a synapse between motor nerve terminals and skeletal
muscle fibers. Its formation requires a proteoglycan from motor nerves, agrin, which binds
to LRP4 to activate the receptor tyrosine kinase MuSK. We and others showed recently that
agrin signaling is also necessary for NMJ maintenance and is compromised in
neuromuscular disorders and in aged mice. Interestingly, APP, a risk gene of AD, is
expressed in skeletal muscles and becomes progressively concentrated at the NMJ after
birth. APP and its homolog APP-like protein 2 (APLP2) regulate NMJ formation. APP can
interact with LRP4 to promote agrin-induced AChR clustering. To understand pathological
mechanisms of muscle weakness in AD, we generated HSA-APPswe that specifically
express in muscles mutant APP with Swedish mutations (APPswe). Remarkably, HSA-
APPswe mice were weak in muscle contractile force, in particular that by nerve
stimulation, and NMJs became denervated with compromised neuromuscular transmission.
Initial mechanistic studies revealed diminished agrin signaling and increased cellular
senescence, a process originally defined as cell growth arrest but increasingly implicated in
ageing-associated processes. While these findings are exciting, they raise many questions.
Is muscle weakness in HSA-APPswe mice due to NMJ decline or vice versa? What is the
primary target of APPswe, pre- or post-synaptic function? How does APPswe impair the
NMJ, by diminishing agrin signaling or by enhancing cellular senescence, or both? And,
how? These questions will be addressed in this proposal. The overarching hypothesis at test
is that APPswe causes NMJ decline in aged mice by impairing agrin signaling and causing
cellular senescence in the muscle. To test this innovative hypothesis, we will determine
whether APPswe promotes NMJ decline by impairing agrin-LRP4 signaling and by
increasing muscle cell senescence. Results will uncover new pathological mechanisms by
which AD-association APP mutations damage the NMJ and reduce muscle strength and
reveal whether restoring agrin-LRP4 signaling and/or inhibiting cellular senescence prevent
NMJ decline and thus improve muscle strength. Such knowledge is prerequisite to
development of effective therapeutic interventions for muscle weakness in AD patients."

medicines with impact on treatment for most pathogens designated threats to human health by the CDC.
Projects 1 and 2 target multi-drug resistant (MDR) Gram-negative pathogens that express adhesive pili
required for colonization and infection in the host habitats involved in acute and chronic/recurrent urinary tract
infections (UTIs) and catheter-associated UTIs (CAUTIs), including MDR Acinetobacter, carbapenem-resistant
Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae.
Project 2 expands on this list to include other Gram-negative pathogens of concern. Since UTIs account for
~10% of antibiotic use in humans, the development of antibiotic-sparing therapeutics will not only allow
treatment of antibiotic-resistant infections, but by reducing the use of current antibiotics, will decrease selective
pressures for resistance. Project 1 is focused on neutralizing bacterial pilus adhesins using glycomimetics
designed in CORE 1 and mAbs developed in CORE 2 that will block critical interactions between bacterial
adhesins and their host ligands. Glycomimetics have shown great promise in neutralizing chaperone/usher
pathway (CUP) adhesins in vivo to treat disease. For example, mannosides, which neutralize uropathogenic E.
coli (UPEC) adhesin FimH, are potent therapeutics for treating and preventing UTI, since FimH is required by
UPEC to colonize the bladder. In collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline a mannoside has been selected to
proceed into Phase 1a/1b clinical trials, thus validating the potential of this strategy. Therapeutic mAbs have
not yet been fully harnessed for treating infectious diseases. With antibiotic resistance on the rise, it is time to
apply this strategy. Project 1 will also target a sortase-assembled pilus adhesin of Gram-positive enterococci,
which causes CAUTIs and is often MDR. Project 2 will use similar tools to focus on the CUP machinery that
assembles the Gram-negative adhesins in Project 1 at the tip of pilus fibers. Project 3 will target all Gram-
positive species identified by the CDC as significant threats by furthering the development of GmPcides, a
novel family of ring-fused 2-pyridone compounds that are bactericidal against a broad spectrum of Gram-
positive species. The COREs will be fully integrated with the Scientific Projects providing computational and
synthetic medicinal chemistry in the development of small molecule therapeutics (CORE 1) and the application
of high throughput mAb generation against bacterial proteins (CORE 2). The combined knowledge, expertise
and successes of the Leaders of the Projects and Cores will lead to the development of antibiotic-sparing
therapeutics for treatment of the growing number of antibiotic-resistant pathogens to stave off the return to the
pre-antibiotic era when common infections were essentially untreatable."
10849795,"SUMMARY
Sepsis is life-threatening syndrome caused by the presence of harmful microorganisms in the blood and
tissues and resulting in host inflammation, coagulopathy and organ dysfunction. As the leading cause of death
in non-cardiac intensive care units, the incidence of sepsis continues to increase while no new effective
therapies have been developed in decades. Among patients, mortality averages 25%, while many survivors
experience long-term disabilities caused by thrombosis, hypoperfusion, and hyperinﬂammation. Globally,
sepsis is more prevalent than cancer with millions of patients and billions of dollars of health care costs
annually. Lack of molecular information of the pathophysiology of sepsis has primarily contributed to the
paucity of new and more effective treatments. This program project renewal proposal continues to address this
problem with novel approaches to advance the knowledge of sepsis from a descriptive to a more molecular
basis. The program retains the expertise of scientists and clinicians whom together are making transformative
discoveries of disease mechanisms and protective strategies targeted by the pathogen and the host in the
onset and progression of sepsis. The proposed program renewal leverages comparative models of
experimental sepsis applied to the discovery of disease mechanisms that rapidly remodel and regulate host
blood and vascular components. Remodeling includes glycosidic and proteolytic processes that cause
profound changes to the half-lives, localization, abundance, and functions of circulating and cell surface
glycoproteins and platelets, linked to the coagulopathy, inflammation, and lethality of sepsis. The program is
integrated by the overall hypothesis that Protein glycosylation and glycoprotein remodeling alter the
coagulopathy and inflammation of sepsis. The three projects and four core facilities proposed will address this
hypothesis with synergistic, interdisciplinary, and state-of-the-art approaches. Aims of the projects and cores
encompass comparative molecular investigations of coagulation factors, tissue thrombosis, inflammation,
serology, and pathogen burden and virulence among blood, urine, and tissue proteomes. Findings thus far
have identified mechanisms that differentially identify and alter sepsis in the context of discrete pathogens
including changes in pathogen virulence, supporting the emerging view that sepsis does not arise from a
singular disease mechanism and may be stratified to achieve diagnostic and therapeutic benefits. Comparative
analyses of experimental and human sepsis will continue as findings thus far have indicated conserved
markers of disease mechanisms linked to stratification by pathogen and patient prognosis. The rationale for the
aims of this program are derived from extensive supporting data and recent peer-reviewed publications.
Additional discoveries that this program is poised to make will enable further advances in the mechanistic
understanding of the life-threatening changes to host blood and vascular systems during sepsis and generate
significant insights needed to develop more effective diagnostics and therapeutics."

Abstract:
The faithful repair of DNA damage and efficient resolution of stalled replication forks are fundamental
mechanisms by which mammalian cells maintain DNA sequence fidelity and chromosomal integrity during DNA
replication and in response to exogenous DNA damage. Defects in DNA repair mechanisms not only contribute
to genomic instability and subsequent tumorigenesis, but also can alter the epigenetic landscape of cells and
impart therapeutic vulnerabilities that can be exploited clinically. The investigators participating in this P01 project
share common interests in understanding the mechanisms by which cells maintain genomic integrity to suppress
tumorigenesis, and in exposing tumor vulnerability to therapy based on mechanistic understandings of the
genomic consequences of impaired DNA repair. One particularly strong area of research offered by this team is
a multi-disciplinary approach to understanding the basic mechanisms by which the BRCA1-PALB2-BRCA2
complex and associated regulators participate in regulating DNA replication and repair choice. Regulators of the
BRCA-network include, 53BP1, RNF4, BARD1, TOPBP1, EHMT2 (G9a), MCM10, SLFN11 (mouse Slfn9), and
BCCIP. Some of these factors have been a long-standing research focus for investigators in the project team.
The research collaboration is formed around the central themes of how members of this large network of proteins
interface with each other to maintain genome integrity, suppress tumor development and modulate tumor
response to cancer therapy. Four projects, two Shared Resource Cores, and an Administrative Core are
proposed to achieve three scientific goals: 1) to reveal novel mechanisms by which the recruitment and function
of the BRCA1-PALB2-BRCA2 network is regulated by chromatin context mediated by methylation, sumoylation,
and ubiquitination; 2) to refine the roles of the BRCA network in DNA replication, tumor suppression and define
the genomic consequences of BRCA dysfunction; and 3) to explore new opportunities to target defects in the
BRCA network for therapeutics in medulloblastoma and breast cancer."

10898689,"SUMMARY (Overall)
One of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency’s (IEMA) long term objectives is to strengthen the
Agency’s collaboration with the FDA. It is hoped that this collaboration will allow IEMA to develop and enhance
its radiological analyses of food capability while contributing to the national effort. In the event of a large scale
nuclear or radiological incident, a high load of food samples will need to be analyzed and reported rapidly and
accurately (Cunningham 2014). The food sample radiological results can then be used to help officials make
well informed decisions/actions to protect public health (EPA 2017). It is IEMA’s objective to ready the
Radiochemistry laboratory for just such an event. The laboratory is currently equipped and prepared for the
analysis of foods for gamma emitting radionuclides. However, we lack the experience to screen foods for
alpha and/or beta emitters and the Agency’s current liquid scintillation counters are at, or close to, the end of
their serviceable life. IEMA is thus seeking support through this radiochemistry analytical development
opportunity in conjunction with the FDA’s scientific expertise to assist in developing the Agency’s capability to
screen foods for alpha and/or beta emitters. If the Agency is awarded this opportunity, collaboration with the
FDA will be enhanced, through training and a face-to-face meetings. When completed, the Radiochemistry
laboratory will demonstrate competency for screening alpha and/or beta emitters and will be ready for the call
to participate in radiological national security exercises, surveillance testing activities and radiological incidents.
As a member of the Food Emergency Response Network, the IEMA Radiochemistry laboratory proposes to
expand the national alpha and beta analysis capacity though its request to purchase a PerkinElmer Quantulus
GCT LSC 6220TR low activity liquid scintillation counter which includes alpha/beta discrimination software
(PerkinElmer 2020). Within the one year project time, the Agency will procure, install, set-up and calibrate the
instrument. The staff will train on the FDA selected method(s) in the analysis of food for alpha and beta-
emitters using liquid scintillation counting. The method(s) will be validated followed by the successfully
demonstration of competency in the validated method(s). IEMA management will support travel to send a
selected staff members to attend the annual Laboratory Flexible Funding Model Face-to Face meeting. The
project aims will be accomplished through Management’s emphasis on successfully expanding our radiological
rapid emergency response analysis of foods, especially for non-gamma emitting radionuclides. This proposal is
supported by the strength of the Radiochemistry laboratory’s staff experience and education and the
availability of the newly remodeled and equipped wet chemistry laboratory. As noted above it is IEMA’s goal to
be ready for the call to participate in radiological national security exercises, surveillance testing activities and
radiological incidents."
10911817,"SUMMARY
Deployment of new antimicrobials is promptly circumvented by the rapid evolution of resistance, underscoring
the critical need for new strategies to stay ahead in the arms-race against bacterial pathogens. Developing a
detailed understanding of the circumstances as well as genetic and mechanistic basis for which antibiotic
resistance develops provides opportunities for pre-emptively subverting this process. While infections caused by
organisms harboring antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes are a major cause of antibiotic treatment failure (ATF),
ATF frequently occurs when the etiological agents are not AMR by traditional susceptibility testing. It is becoming
increasingly recognized that transient cell-states such as tolerance, persistence and hetero-resistance are critical
drivers underlying treatment failure. However, there is a paucity of data with regards to the genetic and
mechanistic basis for these cell-states as well as a lack of diagnostic-detection approaches. ATF cell-states
initially exist as minority variants within a population and display a transient phenotype that tends to dissipate as
the stress subsides, making them challenging to detect and consequently missed in current diagnostic assays.
These enabler cell-states remain mechanistically poorly understood and seem to preferentially arise during
fluctuating treatment regimens, for instance caused by a drug’s PK/PD characteristics, whereby ATF cell-states
can drive the re-emergence of the (susceptible) bacterial infection after antibiotic pressure wanes. Importantly,
this creates opportunities where multi-step high-level resistance mutations are given an extended opportunity to
emerge. Therefore, because antibiotic resistant variants often follow closely on the heels of the occurrence of
ATF cell-states, these cell-states can be viewed as enablers of antibiotic treatment failure and AMR. This
proposal focuses on untangling the importance of ATF cell-states in the emergence of antibiotic
resistance and treatment failure, and designs new approaches and strategies to identify, track and target
them. The main team consists of 4 principal investigators that have a very successful collaboration history.
Together they will work on 5 challenges distributed across 3 projects and supported by an administrative and a
genomics and bioinformatics core. In Challenge: 1) the full profile of possible genetic pathways that can induce
ATF cell-states is determined; 2) treatment regimens that drive the emergence of ATF-cell states are determined;
3) it is determined how ATF cell-states enable the emergence of AMR; 4) drugs and compounds are screened
for, that target ATF cell-state collateral sensitivities; 5) a computational deconvolution approach is developed
that predicts the presence and frequency of ATF cell-states in a complex bacterial population. Overall this
proposal contains a collection of conceptually and technically innovative aspects that are geared towards
understating the genetic mechanisms and evolutionary forces that sit at the root of the emergence of resistance,
with the ultimate goal to design new diagnostics and antimicrobial strategies that can slow or even stop the
current endless arms-race “that takes all the running we can do, to keep in the same place”."
10893415,"PROJECT SUMMARY – OVERALL
Each year ~1.5 million American women enter into the perimenopause, a midlife neuroendocrine transition state
unique to the female. As of 2020, there are 45 million US women over the age of 55. Globally, there are currently
over 850 million women aged 40-60 years of age. Worldwide women have a 2-fold greater risk for developing
Alzheimer’s.
The mission of the Perimenopause in Brain Aging and Alzheimer’s Disease Program Project is to discover
biological transformations in brain that occur during the perimenopausal transition that lead to endophenotypes
predictive of risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Research goals are to identify the mechanisms by which these
transformations occur and to translate these discoveries into strategies to prevent or delay conversion to AD.
Our research has shown that the greater risk for AD is not because women live longer than men but because
the disease can start earlier in women, at midlife during the perimenopausal transition. In the Perimenopause in
Brain Aging and Alzheimer’s Disease program of research, we advance mechanistic, clinical and population
discovery science and translate these discoveries into a platform for precision medicine to prevent, delay and
treat Alzheimer’s disease. Herein we specifically focus on the complex interaction between APOE genotype and
the metabolic and immune systems that initiate and drive pathologies of Alzheimer’s.
To achieve our mission, we have developed a focused research center model with an integrated set of four
Projects and three Cores. Projects 1, 2 and 3 are basic, mechanistic and preclinical translational science
investigations of the perimenopausal brain utilizing humanized APOE mouse models relevant to Alzheimer’s risk
and to human perimenopause. These projects investigate the molecular, cellular and systems biology of immune
signaling in brain and periphery that initiate and drive development of Alzheimer’s disease in brain and
autoimmunity in peripheral organs. Project 4 investigates development of the endophenotype of early stage
Alzheimer’s disease in perimenopausal to postmenopausal women using multi-modal brain imaging and
analyses of peripheral biomarkers. All Projects and Cores are highly integrated and supported by a suite of
enabling strategies and technologies.
Outcomes of proposed aims will generate a mechanistic foundation on which to conduct hypothesis driven
medical informatics, develop neuro-immune biomarkers specific to stages of brain aging and a platform for
precision neuro-immune therapeutics.
The Perimenopause in Brain Aging and Alzheimer’s Disease program of research addresses key strategic goals
of the National Institutes on Aging’s 2016: Aging Well in the 21st Century: Strategic Directions for Research on
Aging, specifically Goals A (1,2,3,7,8,11) & D (1,2,4)."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Xenbase is the Xenopus Model Organism Knowledgebase (MOK), an online resource that
integrates all genomic and biological data from Xenopus research. Our mission is to accelerate
the translation of Xenopus research into knowledge that will improve human health. We aim to
empower Xenopus research and enhance the impact of Xenopus data in the broader biomedical
community, as animal models, such as Xenopus, are essential for biomedical research and
have led to a wealth of discoveries. Xenbase is user-friendly, allowing investigators to quickly
find and link different data types in ways that would otherwise be difficult, time consuming, or
impossible. It provides high quality curation, data integration, and bioinformatics tools to link
Xenopus data to humans and other model organisms, NCBI, UniProt, Ensembl and other
resources. In this post genomic era, with thousands of scientific publications annually, and the
exponential growth of “omic” datasets, Xenbase is essential to translate the enormous amount
of data generated from research using Xenopus into meaningful connected data. Xenbase,
thus, plays an essential role in maximizing NIH’s >$120 million annual investment in Xenopus
research. Xenbase is an essential resource for hundreds of labs around the world. There is a
clear need to continue curating Xenopus data, to develop new tools to keep up with
technological advances, and link Xenopus data to human biology in novel and insightful ways.
Many of the letters of support (more than 110) state that labs could not function without
Xenbase, and renewed funding for Xenbase was identified as the top priority in the 2020
Xenopus research community white paper."
10810658,"Recent high-profile advances have reinvigorated enthusiasm for immunologic and cell-based therapies for
cancer. While the first 15 years of this Program focused on related donor sourced products and defining the
immunogenetics of NK cell contributions to allotransplantation, the adoptive transfer of single donor products is
limited to specialty centers because of high cost, difficulty in exporting, and inability to test multi-dosing strategies.
We have formed new strategic partnerships to shift from single donor products to off-the-shelf approaches. This
approach is simpler for protein-based NK cell immune engagers, as they are readily druggable, but more
challenging for cell products. Therefore, our overall goal is to develop off-the-shelf NK cell products to be used
alone or in combination with novel immune engagers. We have assembled a team of Minnesota and international
experts to lead the Projects and Cores. In Project 1, we discovered that NKG2C+ adaptive NK cells induced by
CMV have properties of immune memory, exhibit a unique methylation signature similar to CD8+ T cells, and are
primed for anti-tumor activity. Our group also published the 1st clinical link between adaptive NK cells and
reduced rates of leukemia relapse in 2016. We will now conduct a multi-institutional phase I/II trial of allogeneic
KIR-HLA mismatched adaptive NK cell infusions to treat patients with AML/MDS. We will also perform preclinical
testing of off-the-shelf NK cell products and novel immune engagers called tri-specific killer engagers (TriKEs).
TriKEs contain 3 arms: an arm that engages the CD16 activating receptor on NK cells; an arm that specifically
engages a tumor antigen on cancer cells; and an IL-15 linker. In the current funding, we discovered that IL-15 is
superior to IL-2 in promoting in vivo NK persistence and expansion; however, it also stimulates host CD8+ T cells
in many subjects, and we will test whether IL-15’s targeted delivery via TriKE minimizes bystander T cell
activation. Project 2 will focus on NHL and clinically test a dual-targeted strategy using an off-the-shelf, iPSC-
derived NK (iNK) cell product containing a CAR against CD19, a CD16 receptor, and membrane bound IL-15.
Preclinically, we will test whether targeting NK cell metabolism can improve in vivo NK cell performance. Project
3 will extend off-the-shelf iNK cell therapies into a solid tumor setting. Initial testing of adaptive NK cells in ovarian
cancer showed that the intraperitoneal (
IP) space is immune privileged and allows for NK cell persistence. We
will conduct a phase I clinical trial to determine whether IP delivery of off-the-shelf iNK cells expressing a non-
cleavable CD16 (FT516)
improves outcomes among patients with ovarian cancer.
Preclinically, we will test novel
immune engagers (TriKEs) in combination with FT516 and a new iNK cell product expressing a chimeric
CD64/16A receptor capable of multi-antibody targeting. Projects will be supported by the Administration &
Clinical Research Support (Core A), Biostatistics (Core B), and Immune Monitoring & Tissue Analysis (Core C)
resources. This Program will build upon our success in establishing a signal of clinical efficacy with single-donor
NK cells by moving from individually sourced related donor products to multi-dosed, off-the-shelf strategies."
10898562,"PROJECT SUMMARY: OVERALL
The overall goal of this Program Project is to gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms that
drive cachexia in cancer patients, especially patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) that
exhibit one of the highest incidences of cachexia among all tumor types. Cancer patients who have lost > 5%
of their pre-illness weight are considered cachectic. In comparison, 85% of PDAC patients lose an average of
14% body weight, and recent published data show that any loss of body weight > 10% in this population leads
to poorer survival. Although some improvements have been made in PDAC to extend the 5-year survival rate,
this is still among the lowest rate of all solid tumors. Thus, until therapeutics are found to effectively treat
PDAC, understanding the causes of cachexia is vital to improving treatment responses, quality of life, and
potentially overall survival. The main innovative concept in our Program Project is the belief that to effective
treat PDAC-induced cachexia one must consider the macroenvironment of this syndrome, so as to treat the
tumor and the wasting of peripheral tissues at the same time. The effectors we focus on in this Program
Project are part of the NF-B/IL-6/STAT3 signaling axis. Our hypothesize is that the NF-B/IL-6/STAT3
signaling axis is a central regulator of the macroenvironment in PDAC-induced cachexia. This hypothesis will
be tested in 3 Projects under the support of 4 Cores. Project 1 focuses on the IL-6/STAT3 portion of the NF-
B/IL-6/STAT3 signaling axis. Specifically, studies will define the participation of IL-6 and the IL-6 receptor
acting through STAT3 to mediate fat and muscle loss. Project 2 focuses on NF-B within the signaling axis,
exploring two fresh concepts in how NF-B functions in muscle stem cells to promote local muscle
inflammation and in PDAC progression by modulating the surveillance of innate and adaptive immune cells.
Project 3 will explore the IL-6/STAT3 axis within stroma fibroblasts. Specifically, how STAT3 signaling in
stromal mesenchymal cells in the tumor and peripheral tissues produces an immunosuppressive
macroenvironment that favors PDAC progression and cancer cachexia. Core A (Administration) will provide
administrative structure for the organization of the program. Core B (Human Biospecimens) will maintain a
repository of tissues from PDAC patients with and without cachexia and support next generation sequencing
analysis. Core C (Immunophenotyping) will provide expertise in scRNA-Seq and multispectral imaging of the
tumor, skeletal muscle, and fat in PDAC-induced cachexia. Core D (Biostatistics) will provide biostatistical
support. This Program contains multiple points of integration founded on collaborations between NCI
designated Cancers Centers at the Medical University of South Carolina and Indiana University and their
respective Cancer Cachexia Programs. The outcome obtained from these studies will advance our basic
understanding of tumor-muscle/fat interactions within a PDAC macroenvironment that will likely apply
to other cancer conditions where cachexia contributes to the morbidity and mortality of patients."

 The theme of the UNC Center for Environmental Health and Susceptibility (CEHS) is translating
interdisciplinary research on environmental health susceptibility to improve public health in North Carolina. The
Center encourages and facilitates collaborations among basic researchers, public health scientists, and
clinicians to generate high impact discoveries that improve public health. Three translational research focus
areas are supported: environmental cancer, cardiopulmonary disease, and developmental disease. Health
disparities and prevalent North Carolina exposures are cross-cutting themes. The strategic vision is implemented
by the Administrative Core, which oversees facility cores, evaluates and funds innovative pilot projects, sponsors
seminars and symposia, supports developing careers, communicates with Center membership, prepares
budgets, reports and newsletters, and tracks publications and grant proposals. The Center has two facility cores
that facilitate human studies and provide scientific support. The Integrated Health Sciences Facility Core (IHSFC)
encourages new clinical and population-based studies and connects members to a wealth of existing studies
and data. The IHSFC also provides expertise in human studies, including professional staffing support for
participant engagement and biospecimen processing. The Molecular Analysis and Statistical Support (MASS)
facility core provides full service scientific support, from study design to data acquisition to analytics. Through
walk-in clinics, individual consultation, training and methods development funding, the MASS core provides
expertise and instrumentation for mass spectrometry, translational histopathology, and cutting edge genomics,
while also providing computational and statistical support with study design, data analysis, training and methods
development. An integrated scientific support model ensures excellence in exposure science, imaging, and
omics studies, strengths of our Center. The Community Engagement Core (CEC) connects CEHS researchers
with community partners, facilitating multidirectional communication and ensuring broad relevance to the State,
both of which are critical to the translational goals of CEHS. Both scientific and engagement projects are
supported by a competitive Pilot Projects program that prioritizes junior faculty. CEHS actively mentors and
cultivates leadership of junior and mid-level career investigators to train the next generation of environmental
health researchers. Through our Stakeholder Advisory Board and External Advisory Board the UNC-CEHS
receives input on environmental exposures of concern in North Carolina communities and feedback on Center
effectiveness. With goals aligned to the NIEHS strategic plan, CEHS serves the public health of North Carolina
and the nation with strategic scientific activities and community engagement."

With Phase III COBRE support, the South Carolina Center in Oxidants, Redox Balance, and Stress Signaling
(Redox COBRE) at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) will complete its transition to long-term
sustainability as a nationally competitive multidisciplinary research program in redox pathobiology. During
Phases I and II, our Redox COBRE was successful in its efforts to (i) expand the critical mass of funded
investigators at MUSC studying the causal role of redox pathways and metabolic dysfunction in a wide range of
human pathologies (cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, gastrointestinal
disorders and drug addiction) and (ii) develop advanced scientific core resources offering a broad range of
capabilities for investigating the biologically significant effects of oxidative stress. Our current core membership
comprises 44 senior and junior faculty members that have received more than $51 million in awards since the
program’s inception. To date, the Redox COBRE has mentored a total of 20 target faculty (junior investigators +
pilot project-supported PIs). Of these individuals, 10 have been promoted and 16 have been retained at our
institution. As a group, these faculty members have published more than 250 peer-reviewed papers and secured
56 extramural grant awards (including 31 NIH grants (PI role) of which 16 are R01 awards and 8 are SBIR/STTR-
supported start-ups). The major components of this Phase III proposal are: (1) an Administrative Core providing
organizational, coordinating, fiscal and accountability functions; (2) an Analytical Redox Core delivering
analytical biochemistry services for quantification of redox-sensitive molecule abundance and redox-based
changes in cellular homeostasis; (3) a Proteomics Core that offers state-of-the-art mass spectrometry (MS) and
MS-imaging capabilities; (4) a Cell & Molecular Redox Imaging Core that provides cell and tissue-based
confocal, multiphoton and super-resolution microscopic imaging; and (5) a Pilot Projects Program (PPP) that
fosters research endeavors utilizing Center resources and facilitates collaborations with Redox COBRE
members. Towards our objective of becoming a stand-alone Center of Redox Biology and Signaling (abbreviated
to “Redox Center”), we will build upon our substantial scientific and institutional achievements, to: (Aim 1)
enhance the function and efficiencies of our scientific cores, achieving optimal positioning to serve Center
thematic and translational goals and achieve/ maintain sustainability; (Aim 2) leverage the PPP to grow center
membership and promote the importance of translational redox signaling research in the context of human
disease; (Aim 3) develop the research portfolio and connections between the Redox COBRE and other IDeA
programs to establish ourselves as a national presence coalescing various disciplines and areas of expertise.
Thus, we are seeking to establish a strategic position for long-term success as an emergent, University-
designated Redox Center that will be one of few national resources for investigators to utilize or develop new
technologies, therapeutics and interventions targeting pathological redox pathways."

Cigarette smoking is the greatest known single risk factor for the development of lung disease, being a
dominant risk for the development of both emphysema and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. We have
assembled a team of investigators who have worked synergistically to better understand the mechanism(s)
by which cigarette smoke can induce either lung fibrosis or emphysema. Our team members are leaders in
the field of COPD and IPF who are most committed to better understand the mechanism(s) by which
cigarette smoke can induce either fibrotic or emphysematous phenotype in the lung. During the previous
years of funding support by P01 HL114501 grant entitled “Distinct and Overlapping Pathways of Fibrosis
and Emphysema in Cigarette Smokers”, we have integrated the expertise of investigators from the COPD
and IPF communities, spanning basic, translational and clinical researchers, to come together to tackle this
important challenge. This synergistic integration among the projects and cores have been impactful and will
continue to be greater than the sum of each of its component parts. We employ both Ureductionist and
mechanisticU approaches by utilizing cell culture and animal models (Project 1 and Project 2), and UdiscoveryU
approaches using high throughput profiling (genomics, epigenetics) methods in human lung tissues and
cells (Project 3) to discover new pathway(s) mediating the fibrotic and emphysema phenotypes in cigarette
smoker. Hence, a PPG mechanism has been not only critical but absolutely necessary to best address the
main objective of this fundamental question at hand: How can we better understand the mechanism(s) by
which cigarette smoke mediates fibrotic or emphysematous phenotype in the lung? We will attempt to reach
our goals by approaches described in the following Uprojects and cores:
Projects:
1) Mitochondrial and Metabolic Dysfunction in COPD and IPF
2) Differential roles of Chi3l1 and its Receptors in Pulmonary Fibrosis and COPD
3) Integrating Omics, Networks, and Functional Studies in COPD and IPF

American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) and Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders (NHPIs) are increasingly
concerned about Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, as these conditions will soon have a major impact
on their communities. Although AI/ANs and NHPIs share a high prevalence of ADRD risk factors, including
hypertension and type 2 diabetes, their life expectancies have improved by as much as 30 years over the last 5
decades, resulting in a tripling of their populations’ share of people ages 65+. Unfortunately, the healthcare
systems that serve AI/ANs and NHPIs are unprepared for the clinical, social, and economic, burdens associated
with ADRD. The Natives Engaged in Alzheimer’s Research Center will be the only P01 to include AI/ANs or
Native Hawaiians since the National Institute on Aging started cataloging P01s in 1984. Based at Washington
State University, with collaborators at the University of Miami, Brigham Young University, and several other major
universities, as well as with AI/AN and NHPI community partners, we will create an innovative program to
understand, intervene on, and mitigate ADRD-related health disparities experienced by our priority populations.
Our 3 Research Projects will be supported by Administrative, Research Methods, Recruitment and Engagement,
and Biospecimen Cores. The Center will also feature a network of 8 Satellite Centers led by Native researchers
that encompass areas where 90% of AI/ANs and NHPIs reside. These Satellite Centers will ensure that our work
and our dissemination efforts are national in scope and help to create research-ready cohorts. The Center will
unite scholars across social, clinical, and behavioral sciences. Notably, 12 AI/AN or NH/PI professionals have
committed to participate as Investigators or Consultants. Thus, our Specific Aims are to: 1) In a group-
randomized trial, test the effectiveness of a culturally informed provider training and “dementia-friendly clinic”
intervention for detection and appropriate management of AI/AN patients with ADRD and mild cognitive
impairment in at least 20 urban and rural clinics serving AI/ANs; 2) In a group-randomized controlled trial, test
the effectiveness of a Hula intervention for preventing cognitive decline in NHPI elders with subjective cognitive
impairments or mild cognitive impairment in the Hawaiian Islands; 3) In an observational study, screen AIs in
2 remote reservation communities for obstructive sleep apnea and cognitive impairment, then conduct a
randomized controlled trial to test an intervention to improve adherence to sleep apnea treatment for improving
or preserving cognitive function; 4) Genotype DNA from saliva samples, catalog the frequency of genetic
markers for ADRD risk, and calculate polygenic risk scores for ADRD using biospecimens from 2,700+ AI/ANs
and NHPIs; and 5) Create an innovative P01 to understand, intervene on, and mitigate ADRD disparities in
AI/ANs and NHPIs. Our leadership, resources, and experience offer an unprecedented opportunity to address
the National Institute on Aging’s research priorities for underrepresented minorities, as articulated in the National
Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, and to respond directly to its interest in diversifying the scientific workforce."

The goal of this application is the continued development and maintenance of the Gene Expression
Database for Mouse Development (GXD). GXD is a well-established community resource. It integrates
different types of expression data including biologically complex data, such as RNA in situ hybridization and
immunohistochemistry results, and high-throughput expression data from RNA-seq experiments. It places
these data in the larger biological context through integration with other Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI)
resources and interconnections with many other databases, supporting complex queries that enable thorough
biological and computational analyses.
The specific aims of this proposal are (1) to continue and expand GXD’s curation of expression data and
anatomical ontologies and ensure high-quality data annotation and integration. We will continue to
curate data from RNA in situ hybridization, in situ-reporter knock-in, immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, Northern
blot and Western blot experiments; and expand our annotation of bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data sets. We
will enhance the mouse anatomy ontology, and refine our expression annotations by combining anatomy and
cell type terms. We will (2) maintain the GXD database and enhance GXD’s infrastructure and data entry
interfaces to accommodate large volumes of expression data and to represent new types of data and
relationships. We will enhance the database and software infrastructure to accommodate the expected
increase in RNA-seq data. We will expand the database to represent anatomical differentiation pathways, as
well as expression annotations to cell type terms. We will continue to modernize the editorial interface and
expand the interface as needed for the annotation of new data types. We will automate more steps of the
literature selection process to increase curation efficiency. We will (3) continue to evolve GXD’s user
interface and develop advanced query and display tools. We will develop expression searches that allow
the analysis of anatomical differentiation pathways and cell types. We will add support for quantitative
expression analyses, comparisons and profiling. We will develop displays that superimpose expression data
with molecular pathway and protein interaction data to support the analysis of molecular networks with co-
expression information. We will (4) provide user support and promote use of GXD by the scientific
community. We will continue to provide training and to solicit feedback on how we can improve GXD."

clinical studies have implicated in late-life cognitive outcomes as well as in risk and resilience for late-onset

10911841,"TITLE: Biotechnology Resource Center of BioModular Multi-scale Systems (CBM2) for Precision Medicine
Overall: Developing New Technologies for Enabling Precision Medicine
Abstract/Summary
Liquid biopsies represent an exciting contribution to in vitro diagnostics (IVDs) because of the minimally invasive
nature of securing markers, the plethora of marker types (circulating biological cells, cell-free molecules [proteins,
micro-RNA, cell-free DNA], and extracellular vesicles [exosomes]), and the diverse molecular information they
carry. Unfortunately, many of these markers have not been fully utilized in the clinic primarily because disease-
associated liquid biopsy markers can be a vast minority in a mixed population making them difficult to find and
analyze. This is partly due to a lack of platforms for their efficient isolation and tools to analyze the limited
numbers of diseased molecules contained in a liquid biopsy isolate. For example, a single circulating tumor cell
(CTC) carriers ~6 pg of genomic DNA. Next Generate Sequencing (NGS) requires ~30 ng of input nucleic acid
material. Thus, high levels of amplification must be used to analyze a single CTC, which can create biased
representation of the genome and/or mask important molecular features, such as epigenetic modifications.
The Biotechnology Resource Center of BioModular Multi-scale Systems (CBM2) for Precision Medicine is
seeking to evolve its vision with the delivery of new and innovative platform technologies to process liquid biopsy
markers. The platform technologies will possess the ability to isolate disease-associated liquid biopsy markers
(outputs from the active P41 Center) and analyze their molecular cargo using amplification-free assays with
sufficient sensitivity to process single molecules (new to this application). This will be realized through three
tightly focused, yet highly interactive Translational Research and Development efforts: (1) Solid-phase enzymatic
nanoscale reactors and nano-electrophoresis for detection and identification of single-molecules; (2) label-free
detection strategies using dual-nanopore time-of-flight (TOF) sensor poised within a fluidic network to read the
TOF of single molecules for highly efficient identification; and (3) mixed-scale (nm → mm) and modular fluidic
systems comprised of task-specific modules assembled using robust strategies. The modular system can
perform single-molecule processing of a molecular entity secured from a liquid biopsy marker in an amplification-
free format with full process automation. Delivery of CBM2's platform technologies to the biomedical community
will be realized through a production pipeline of chips operated by the Center.
CBM2 consists of a highly accomplished and multidisciplinary team that is well versed in producing successful
outcomes from large multi-institutional projects. The Center research will be facilitated by the extensive
infrastructure in place as a result of the Center's current phase of operation (2015 – 2020). Translation of its
platform technologies into the biomedical community will be facilitated by an engaging training/dissemination

The Agricultural Chemistry Laboratory is interested in testing animal food products for both
microbiological and chemical constituents to help bolster the integrated food safety system
established by the FDA. The proposed multifaceted project will help strengthen and improve
FDA’s efforts to prevent foodborne illnesses and minimize foodborne exposures by adding our
laboratory capabilities to a nationally integrated laboratory science system. The funding from
this cooperative agreement will help to equip the Agricultural Chemistry Laboratory with
additional resources that can be used to build and increase sample throughput capacity and
capability for our state. Currently, our connection to the LDAF Feed program and organizational
infrastructure as the statutorily mandated state laboratory for Louisiana makes the Agricultural
Chemistry Laboratory well suited to receive and analyze food samples collected statewide.
Additionally, the Agricultural Chemistry Laboratory (ISO 17025-2017 accredited) houses all
pertinent analytical equipment as well as experienced and competent personnel needed to
maintain quality data for this nationally integrated laboratory science system. Funding from this
cooperative agreement would increase our capacity and capability to help strengthen the FDA’s
integrated food safety system."

10895330,"RESEARCH SUMMARY/ABSTRACT OF PROGRAM
The fundamental challenge in treating the hyper-inflammatory state underlying Acute Lung Injury/Acute
Respiratory Distress Disorder (ALI/ARDS) is that broad anti-inflammatory interventions could compromise host
defense and potentially exacerbate the underlying infectious process that triggered ALI/ARDS. Novel targeted
approaches to treat ALI/ARDS thus require an in-depth understanding of the intricate inflammatory mechanisms
to reduce the extent of injury and promote the resolution of inflammation as well as the initiation of lung repair
without compromising host defense. It is now recognized that macrophages (Mφ) in lungs represent diverse
multi-functional cell populations. They have the ability to sense pathogens and danger signals, and their plasticity
and diversity allows them to respond in specialized manners to specific niche environments. They are able to
change their phenotypes in a chameleon-like manner by activation of specialized transcriptional programs. Thus,
they have the remarkable ability to amplify inflammation and also to coordinate resolution of lung inflammatory
lung injury and restore homeostasis. Mφ carry out these functions through the release of an array of cytokines,
phagocytosis of microbes, efferocytosis of dead cells, and provide the essential inflammatory or reparative
signals to nearby cells. The central focus of this program will be to precisely define the roles of distinct
macrophage subpopulations in inflammatory lung injury and signaling nodes to harness the plasticity of
macrophages and thereby bring about the resolution of lung injury. Project 1 will test the hypothesis that two
specific specific ion channels, P2RX7 (Purinergic Receptor 2 subtype X7) and the potassium (K+) efflux channel
TWIK2 regulate the plasticity to either promote lung injury or to activate the repair program. Project 2 will test
the hypothesis that the transcription factor CREB and its downstream targets are critical regulators of the anti-
inflammatory and reparative function of alveolar Mφ. Project 3 will test the hypothesis that endothelial cells lining
all lung vessels direct the plasticity of Mφ via modulation of Wnt signaling in Mφ. Project 4 will test the
hypothesis that circulating postnatal CX3CR1+ monocytes replenish lung interstitial Mφ during inflammatory
injury and can direct the lung tissue repair program. These four Projects are supported and complemented by
highly innovative scientific Cores which will provide important optogenetic tools (Synthetic Biology and
Optogenetics Core B), super-resolution and intravital imaging (Advanced Imaging Core C), and access to
clinical samples as well as single cell transcriptomic analysis of macrophages (Clinical Sampling and
Genomics Core D) to unravel the complexities of macrophage biology in lung injury, thus paving the way for
much-needed novel therapeutic approaches in ALI/ARDS."

IDENTIFYING METABOLIC VULNERABILITIES IN LUNG CANCER
Lung Cancer is the most common cause of cancer deaths world-wide. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors and
immunotherapy have been shown to be effective in a subset of patients; however, the overall survival rate for
this disease remains low especially for metastatic disease. Moreover, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients
have a poor prognosis, and there especially exists a gap in knowledge in understanding SCLC and identifying
effective therapeutic strategies. Our goal in this proposal is to understand the underlying biology of key drivers
in lung cancer by identifying metabolic vulnerabilities that can ultimately be used as single agents or combined
with immunotherapy to target lung cancer therapeutically. We will achieve this goal by engaging experts that
have developed preclinical models with common molecular signatures in non-small cell (NSCLC) and small cell
lung cancer (SCLC) and cutting-edge metabolomics. We have an active and collaborative group that meets twice
monthly with projects and manuscripts that are co-authored by the leaders of each project and core. Additionally,
our Program Project Grant (PPG) team is located at Moffitt Cancer Center, which is an ideal place to study the
pathogenesis of lung cancer. Florida is number 2 in the country in terms of newly diagnosed lung cancer patients.
Moffitt treats 10% of these cases. The PPG consists of four projects and four cores. These projects and cores
collaborate and synergize to meet four objectives: i. To identify metabolic vulnerabilities in lung cancers through
integrative analysis of in vivo and ex vivo models with common molecular signatures, including p53,
NRF2/KEAP1, and MYC (Project #1, led by Dr. Flores, Project #2, led by Dr. DeNicola, Project #3, led by Drs.
Cleveland and Haura, and Project #4, led by Dr. Rodriguez with support from the Administrative Core #1, led
by Drs. Flores and Haura, Preclinical Models and Pathology Core #2, led by Drs. Cress and Karreth, Metabolism
Core #3, led by Dr. Koomen, and Data Science Core #4, led by Dr. Fridley), ii. To identify metabolic
vulnerabilities that synergize with immunotherapy through examining the tumor microenvironment and gaining a
deep molecular understanding of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). (Project #4 in collaboration with
Projects #1 and #2 and Core #2), iii. To build mouse models as a platform to understand the metabolic pathways
utilized by lung cancers with different genetic signatures and to assess therapeutic strategies for lung cancer.
(Core #2 supporting Projects #1-4), and iv. To share resources and data locally and globally to obtain an
integrated molecular understanding of metabolic vulnerabilities in lung cancer. (Core #4 leading efforts from All

 Abstract- Overall
 Food surveillance testing is an integral part of protecting consumers and the nation’s
food supply. In order to detect and remove contaminated food from the supply chain, it is
important for agricultural agencies to be able to quickly and accurately test for a wide variety of
pathogens. The proposed project will increase the overall testing capabilities and capacities of
food testing in West Virginia. This mitigation will directly decrease the risk of contaminated foods
from reaching endpoint consumers.
 The West Virginia Department of Agriculture (WVDA) will specifically aim to enhance the
capability and capacity of WV’s human and animal food testing laboratories in support of an
integrated food safety system. The WVDA will provide enhanced sample collections and test
offerings in the fields of microbiology and chemistry that are ISO accredited and accepted by the
FDA. The WVDA will also develop special projects that will support and expand related testing.
The WVDA also aims to strengthen and improve the collaboration of surveillance activities
between the FDA and other laboratory partners.
 The West Virginia Department of Agriculture serves as the primary regulatory agency for
human and animal food product testing and is also the primary regulatory agency for the testing
of manufactured foods (MFRPS) and animal food (AFRPS) in WV.
 The laboratories have 18 methods that are ISO 17025 accredited. The agency has been
an active member of the Food Emergency Response Network (FERN) since 2005. The
laboratories have completed method development, single and multi-laboratory method
validations, and surveillance activities for FERN. The WVDA actively conducts analysis of foods
for microbiology and chemistry food defense purposes as well.
 The WVDA has demonstrated that with the infrastructure and experience of personnel,
the facility, ISO accreditation, research projects, method developments, and on-going
surveillance projects that it is committed to completing the objectives of this track. This project
will enhance the human food surveillance capability and capacity of the WVDA and help support

10799591,"ABSTRACT
Antibiotic resistance is one of the most serious medical challenges of our time. This crisis puts patients at risk
of untreatable bacterial infections and threatens major advances of modern medicine that rely on antibiotics
(transplants, chemotherapy, etc). There are at least 2.8 million antibiotic resistant infections each year in the
US, leading to over 35,000 deaths [1]. Without significant action, worldwide annual mortality due to these
infections is predicted to reach 10 million by 2050, surpassing that predicted for cancer [2]. Understanding
resistance mechanisms is critical to designing novel approaches and therapeutics to combat resistant bacteria.
Heteroresistance (HR) is an enigmatic form of antibiotic resistance in which a bacterial isolate harbors a
resistant subpopulation that can rapidly replicate in the presence of an antibiotic, while a susceptible
subpopulation is killed [3, 4]. Not only do many species of bacteria exhibit this form of phenotypic resistance,
but it has been reported against nearly all classes of antibiotics [3, 5, 6]. Unfortunately, our understanding of
HR is extremely limited and its relevance during infection has been unclear. We recently demonstrated that HR
to diverse antibiotics, including the last-line antibiotic colistin, can cause treatment failure in an in vivo model [4,
5, 7]. Furthermore, when the frequency of the resistant subpopulation is very low (<1 in 10,000 cells) HR is
misclassified as susceptible by clinical diagnostic tests, yet is still able to mediate treatment failure [4]. Our
surveillance data reveal that HR to diverse classes of antibiotics is widespread even among highly resistant
carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB). Further, we recently
discovered that targeting pan-resistant bacteria with two antibiotics to which a strain exhibits HR reliably leads
to effective combination therapy, highlighting that knowledge of HR can be used to guide effective therapies
[5]. Taken together, these data highlight a largely unappreciated and undetected epidemic of HR in the
clinic that may cause unexplained antibiotic treatment failure but can also be exploited therapeutically.
The Heteroresistance Interdisciplinary Research Unit (HR-IRU) brings together an interdisciplinary team of
experts in an unprecedented effort to understand the mechanisms, dynamics, and prevalence of HR. The
proposed projects, supported by Clinical Isolate and Single-Cell Analysis Cores, will use a combination of
genetics, single cell microscopy, dynamic flow and in vivo infection studies, modeling, and epidemiological
analyses to make foundational insights into HR. At a basic level, this work will significantly broaden our
understanding of how traits exhibited by subpopulations of cells can impact bacterial physiology. At a
translational level, this effort will be a critical step in our fight against antibiotic resistant bacteria and lay the
foundation for the discovery of novel therapeutics, diagnostics, and approaches to alleviate human suffering."
10897908,"Overall Summary – Roswell Park Ovarian Cancer SPORE
This is the revised competing renewal application of the Roswell Park Ovarian Cancer SPORE. We have made
significant progress on the translational objectives and human endpoints of each Individual Research Project
(IRP). Our highly successful Developmental Research Program (DRP) and Career Enhancement Program (CEP)
have catalyzed new translational ovarian cancer research projects, collaborations, and extramural funding for
awardees. Our overarching goal remains unchanged: to conduct multidisciplinary, mechanism-based and
collaborative translational research that will have the highest possible impact for women with ovarian cancer.
Because immunotherapies have met with only modest success in ovarian cancer patients, we continue to
uniquely focus on novel strategies for generating effective anti-tumor immunity by unraveling immune-resistance
mechanisms and identifying novel proteogenomic biomarkers of responsiveness. After significant planning and
guidance by our Internal and External Advisory Boards, and Patient Advocate Committee, we have leveraged
our highly successful DRP and CEP to propose three bi-directional translational IRPs addressing basic and
clinical research questions of importance in ovarian cancer. The new IRP1 and IRP2 evolved as a result of two
DRP awards and the new IRP3 developed from a CEP award. IRP1 will test an oncolytic virus armed with a
CXCR4 antagonist in combination with PDL1 blockade to abrogate tumor immune suppression and limit T cell
exhaustion in a randomized Phase I/II clinical trial. IRP2 will test a novel strategy of rendering NY-ESO-1-reactive
TCR transgenic T cells to be insensitive to the suppressive action of TGF and concomitantly neutralize M2-
macrophages/myeloid-derived suppressor cells. IRP3 addresses the completely novel concept of identifying
mismatch between immunopeptidomes of ovarian cancer cells versus dendritic cells and leveraging a
computational approach of bypassing such mismatch. IRP1 commences with a planned clinical trial; the Phase
I/II clinical trials in IRP2 and IRP3 will commence in year 3 following preclinical, IND-enabling translational
studies. The program also continues to expand opportunities for new avenues of ovarian cancer translational
research via its successful DRP and CEP. The four highly integrated, interconnected shared resource cores –
Administration, Biospecimen & Pathology, Biostatistics & Bioinformatics, and Immunogenomics – bring
innovative technology and resources to the SPORE and do not duplicate pre-existing shared resources available
at Roswell Park. This application is strongly supported by nearly $4M institutional commitment to ensure its
success of conducting highly innovative translational research that changes the clinical practice paradigm in
ovarian cancer."

University of Guam (UOG) and the University of Hawai‘i Cancer Center (UHCC) that continues to advance
cancer health equity, increase the cancer research and education capacity, and decrease significant cancer
disparities in Pacific Islands Populations. Americans of Pacific Islander ancestry are a highly underserved and
vulnerable minority with a disparate cancer burden, including significant underrepresentation among cancer
and biomedical researchers and healthcare providers, which further exacerbates the disparities. The
overarching goal and long-term objective are to promote cancer health equity and mitigate the impact of cancer
on Pacific Island Populations through increasing cancer research leadership and capacity in Hawai‘i, Guam
and the United States Affiliated Pacific Islands, which comprise the Pacific Island Populations addressed by
this project. As the only National Cancer Institute-funded Partnership serving the underrepresented Pacific
Island region, PIPCHE will accomplish its goals through the following specific aims: (1) Continue to develop a
diverse portfolio of Pacific Island Population-focused cancer research projects that include clinical, basic, and
population health sciences, (2) Collaborate with local and regional Pacific Island community organizations that
work with underrepresented Pacific Island Populations to promote cancer health equity and enhance
opportunities for research training and workforce development, (3) Sustain, strengthen, and continuously
evaluate of all the Partnership’s research, core activities, and research education programs, (4) Enhance and
implement evidence-based, relevant, cancer-related public health interventions and cancer, prevention and
control strategies with and within underrepresented communities, and (5) Expand the scientific collaboration
among PIPCHE members and other faculty within the two institutions, with an emphasis on recruiting Early
Stage Investigators of Pacific Island ancestry. PIPCHE will carry out these aims by continued investment in
four Cores (Cancer Outreach, Research Education, Planning and Evaluation, and Administration), which
provide the infrastructure and governance of the Partnership. The proposed Shared Resources (Biostatistics,
Epidemiology, Information Technology, and Cancer Registry) will provide essential technical and scientific
support to the PIPCHE student scholars, trainees, and the proposed full research projects and pilot projects
that specifically address the cancer disparities of the Pacific Island Populations. Using its arc of cancer equity,
PIPCHE has identified 10 major domains (education/health literacy, policy, environment, lifestyle,
culture/community, biology, treatment, healthcare access, psycho-social, and socio-economic status) that
influence Pacific Islander cancer health disparities/equity. Each of the research projects, cores, and
infrastructure affects one or more of the domains, and therefore knowledge about the action of PIPCHE’s work
is value added and helpful, as individuals as a team, while working towards Pacific cancer health equity."

diagnosis, pathology, treatment, complications and outcomes of primary glomerular diseases may be modified
by the risks associated with diabetes, however, the literature is greatly lacking in this area. Such information is
crucial to optimizing beneficial therapies and minimizing complications and cost in the care of glomerular
disease patients. CureGN-Diabetes is a prospective, longitudinal observational study of patients with one of
the four most common primary glomerular diseases: IgA nephropathy (IgAN), focal segmental
glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), minimal change disease (MCD), and membranous nephropathy (MN). It is an
ancillary study to the parent CureGN study which is currently in its second cycle of NIH/NIDDK funding and has
enrolled 2400 patients with IgAN, FSGS, MCD and MN, but excluded patients with diabetes prevalent at the
time of glomerular disease diagnosis. The exclusion of diabetes had an unexpected and disproportionate effect
on recruitment among minorities and sites in the southeastern U.S., as these populations suffer among the
highest rates of diabetes. CureGN-Diabetes will fill this gap in the CureGN study and will also leverage control
data from the TRIDENT Study, a longitudinal cohort of patients with biopsy proven diabetic glomerulosclerosis.
Harmonization of data from CureGN, TRIDENT and CureGN-Diabetes, will provide an opportunity to study the
effects of primary glomerular disease alone, diabetic glomerulosclerosis alone and the combined effects of
primary glomerular disease AND diabetes. The aims of CureGN-GN Diabetes include: 1) To recruit and follow
a multiethnic cohort of 300 adult patients with diabetes mellitus and biopsy documented IgAN, FSGS, MN, and
MCD; 2) To assess the impact of diabetes on presenting features (clinical and histopathologic) and long term
outcomes in patients with IgAN, FSGS, MN, and MCD; AND 3) To identify individual and clusters of
morphologic lesions which carry diagnostic and prognostic value. A strength of this study is the significant
overlap between investigators and clinical sites involved in the CureGN and TRIDENT studies, which will
expedite the efficiency and productivity emanating from this work. Furthermore, the CureGN-Diabetes Study
will add to the available biorepositories of CureGN and TRIDENT, enriching the resources for future biomarker
and mechanistic studies of primary glomerular disease versus diabetes-mediated pathways"
10804712,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
 This COBRE will establish a Center on Sleep and Circadian Rhythms in Child and Adolescent Mental
Health at the EP Bradley Hospital in Rhode Island. Bradley Hospital is unique in the US as a psychiatric
institution exclusively focused on children and a national resource for research in child and adolescent
psychiatry. Links between mental illness and sleep are indisputable; probing and identifying the links from
sleep and circadian rhythms to pediatric mental illness and mental health can identify important pathways to
prevention and early intervention, not the least because these factors are amenable to behavioral change and
to defined therapeutic targeting. This COBRE aims to build a bridge from the sleep and circadian knowledge
base and relevant research methods to the outstanding mental health research and clinical care that
characterize Bradley Hospital. The proposed COBRE Center would be the first and only NIH-funded research
center to have an explicit focus on sleep, circadian rhythms, and pediatric mental health. The Center will train,
mentor, and support junior investigators toward independent research careers. The Center’s research Cores
will host training in the assessment of pediatric mental health and in sleep and circadian theory, science, and
methods. The objective of this COBRE Center is to establish and build a comprehensive and sustainable
resource to support the growth of research in pediatric sleep, circadian rhythms, and mental health while
providing mentorship of junior Project Leaders for research and for transitioning to independent scientific
careers with external funding. The Center is committed to diversity in faculty, mentors, investigators, research
approaches and methods, and research participants. Four promising young investigators have each proposed
a project that highlights the diverse and complex nature of this endeavor. Project 1 will measure sleep,
circadian timing, and fMRI to assess Self Critical Rumination and Self Reassurance in adolescents at risk for
suicidal thoughts and actions. Project 2 evaluates sleep patterns and circadian timing in youth who have a
rare DNA copy number variant associated with autism and schizophrenia and includes a circadian clock gene.
Project 3 assess in school children (grades 1-3) how green space use impacts sleep and mental health.
Project 4 uses an intensive sleep and chronobiology in-lab approach to determine how sleepiness and memory
in early adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are affected by sleep bioregulatory
factors. The ultimate goal of this COBRE is to ease the burden of these issues for children, adolescents, and
their families through enhancing the research workforce and capabilities. The promise of this COBRE to fulfill
its place as a true center of biomedical research excellence is strong, and the most important, special, and
notable aspect of this proposed center is the vulnerable population that forms the heart of our work."
10875753,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is a leading cause of death in the United States.
Clinical and epidemiological studies show that chronic psychological stress and elevated levels of glucocorticoids
(GCs), the major stress hormones, are associated with increased risk of developing AD. However, very little is
known about how stress triggers or exacerbates AD pathomechanisms. Our recent work has shown that chronic
stress/GCs induce Tau accumulation and hyperphosphorylation, as well as Tau-dependent hippocampal atrophy
and learning/memory deficits. Moreover, stressed AD mouse models appear to show a stereotypical spreading
of Tau pathology between anatomically connected brain regions, similar to what is observed in AD patient brains.
Such spreading occurs via neuronal secretion of pathogenic Tau species, with the potential involvement of
exosomes, secreted vesicles that mediate intercellular communication. These findings implicate Tau as a critical
mediator of stress-induced brain pathology. However, the underlying mechanisms linking stress/GCs to Tau
pathogenesis remain poorly understood. Similarly, there are few if any biomarkers for detecting/monitoring
stress-related brain pathology, which could facilitate earlier diagnosis and treatment of AD. In this innovative and
interdisciplinary proposal, we will address these issues. In Aim 1, we will elucidate the cellular and molecular
mechanisms of stress/GC-induced Tau accumulation and secretion. Using cell biological approaches, we will
investigate the relationship between GC-induced degradative pathway dysfunction, Tau aggregation, and
Tau/exosome secretion in neurons and glia. In parallel, we will perform cell type-specific gene expression
profiling in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) conditional knockout mice to determine how stress regulates the
transcriptomes of hippocampal neurons, astrocytes, and microglia to promote Tau pathology. In Aim 2, we will
investigate how stress mediates the propagation of Tau pathology in vivo. Here, we will assess the ability of
chronic stress to stimulate Tau propagation and the spreading of Tau pathology, focusing the roles of exosomes
and microglia in this process. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the biomarker potential of exosomes in stress-driven
brain pathology. Here, we will isolate exosomes from blood and brains of wild-type mice and three AD/tauopathy
mouse models after exposure to control or stress conditions. Proteomics and microRNA profiling will be used to
compare their contents and identify proteins and microRNAs that are up/downregulated by stress. These
experiments will reveal whether there are robust markers of stress that can be detected in exosomes across sex,
AD model, and tissue type. Overall, these studies will illuminate cellular mechanisms by which stress/GCs induce
Tau-related neurotoxicity, and lead to novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers for AD diagnosis and treatment."
10817145,"Summary: Overall section
Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, making it a major public health concern (1).
Approximately a quarter of all chronic stroke survivors present with aphasia, a language disorder caused by
damage to the speech and language areas of the brain (3, 4). In a recently published report, Simmons-Mackie
(1) estimates that over two million people in North America are currently living with aphasia. Stroke is typically
thought to affect older persons; however, the incidence of stroke in younger individuals has been steadily
increasing (2). In fact, at least half of all stroke patients in the state of South Carolina are under the age of 60
(2). Aphasia can vary in severity from very profound impairment that renders patients mute and without the
ability to understand others’ speech, to milder forms where patients have great difficulty retrieving specific
words. In the chronic stage of stroke, aphasia has been identified as the strongest predictor of poor quality of
life. Aphasia not only influences the ability to communicate with family and friends, but also drastically
decreases education and employment opportunities. Although some degree of spontaneous recovery from
aphasia is typical in the first weeks and months following stroke, many patients are left with devastating
communication problems and never fully recover.
To address the need for studies improving long-term outcomes in aphasia, the Center for the Study of Aphasia
Recovery (C-STAR), funded for just under four years at the time of this application, has made great progress
towards understanding the mechanisms that promote spontaneous and therapy-induced recovery in aphasia.
The overarching goal of the research proposed in this renewal application is to maintain our focus on aphasia
therapy. Specifically, during the next funding phase, the focus of C-STAR is to improve access to aphasia
therapy, enhance the effect of behavioral aphasia therapy to promote an improved aphasia therapy outcome,
and understand overall health and neurolinguistic factors that influence aphasia recovery.
To accomplish our research goals, this project will continue to rely on collaboration among five main
investigators: Drs. Julius Fridriksson, Argye Hillis, Leonardo Bonilha, Chris Rorden, and Greg Hickok. Projects
led by Fridriksson (chronic patients) and Hillis (acute patients) will continue to focus on factors that may
promote improved outcome of aphasia therapy. Both projects have proven successful in yielding a vast, unique
dataset including measures of brain status and response to aphasia therapy. Relying on this dataset, Bonilha
and Rorden’s project will focus on the relationship between brain health and recovery from aphasia, whereas
Hickok will utilize the same data to better understand aphasic impairment in relation to aphasia therapy
success as well as new neurolinguistic models of speech and language processing."
10883887,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Aging is accompanied by increasing vulnerability to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
The ongoing rise in both AD and CVD has been ascribed to the increasing adoption of a Western sedentary
lifestyle accompanied by a diet rich in fats and sugars. To understand the links between AD and CVD in human
subjects, non-invasive imaging methods such X-ray computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR)
are essential. Cardiac CT is one of the most powerful applications of these methodologies at both clinical and
preclinical levels, but it is currently limited by its low contrast resolution. Our primary objective in this proposal
is to improve the current status of cardiac CT based on photon counting detector technology and demonstrate
its capabilities in preclinical studies focused on studying the interaction between CVD and AD. Our central
hypothesis is that cardiac photon counting CT will provide low dose spectral characterization of atherosclerotic
plaques together with cardiac function, while enabling longitudinal monitoring of interventions such as exercise.
We will pursue three specific aims. In specific aim 1, we will develop the theoretical foundation and GPU
optimized tools for reconstruction of cardiac 5D (3D + Time + Energy) photon counting CT data. We will
incorporate deep learning solutions to overcome fundamental barriers to the advancement of this technology:
regularization to deal with image noise associated with photon binning, robust material decomposition to combat
spectral distortion, and automated cardiac function and plaque analysis to handle data dimensionality. During
the second specific aim, we will characterize the performance of our novel cardiac photon counting CT imaging
using simulations, phantoms and animal experiments to show its benefits for atherosclerotic plaque
characterization and cardiac function estimation. Finally, in specific aim 3 we will investigate if cardiovascular
risk impacts brain phenotypes in animal models of genetic risk for AD. CVD and AD share a genetic link via the
ApoE gene and its isomorphic allele 4 (APOE4). We will use APOE3/HN and APOE4/HN mouse strains that
express the corresponding specific targeted-replacement human APOE allele, on a humanized Nitric Oxide
Synthase 2 (denoted here as HN) background. Using these models, we will first assess the impact of a high fat,
high sugar diet on cardiovascular phenotypes (atherosclerotic plaque size, numbers; cardiac function measured
with CT) and how these genetic differences are reflected in behavior and brain MR based biomarkers compared
with control mice in the same background. Finally, we will also investigate the potential to rescue these
phenotypes using exercise as the intervention. The impact of the proposed research will validate the usage of
photon counting CT technology to enhance routine cardiac CT imaging applications. Our project will enable new
powerful integrative approaches to examine the impact of environmental stressors to alter APOE genotype-
specific vulnerability, or resilience to CVD and AD."
10758002,"Project Summary
 Many states are aggressively reforming their long-term services and supports systems by constraining
the growth of nursing homes and expanding availability of home and community-based services (HCBS) through
Medicaid waiver programs, which intend to maximize independent living for individuals at risk for nursing home
care. Eligibility criteria for Medicaid HCBS waiver programs include financial and health-related factors, the latter
which typically include functional and cognitive deficits. Medicaid HCBS waiver program populations of older
adults across the states include individuals living at home with and without diagnosed Alzheimer's disease and
related dementia (ADRD) as well as with a wide range of cognitive deficits even without a diagnosis of ADRD.
 ADRD is associated with many adverse health-related outcomes in population-based studies of
community-dwelling older adults; however, whether and how ADRD and cognitive impairment severity are
associated with adverse outcomes among older adults receiving services from Medicaid HCBS waiver programs
is unknown. Little is known about the strength of informal caregiver support systems and their effects on adverse
outcomes for older adults with and without dementia in HCBS programs. Success in meeting self-identified goals
of care among older Medicaid HCBS waiver participants, and barriers to achieving these goals, have also not
been explored in the context of having ADRD. Moreover, how race and ethnicity might modify effects in
associations between ADRD, informal support systems, and health outcomes is unknown in this population.
 We propose to address these important and interrelated knowledge gaps guided by person-centeredness
and health disparities conceptual frameworks. We will study a statewide population enrolled in Connecticut's
Home Care Program for Elders (CHCPE), the Medicaid HCBS waiver program for older adults. CHCPE has a
racially and ethnically diverse population, and State Medicaid policy decision-makers have expressed strong
interest in improving dementia care for CHCPE participants. In Connecticut, a person-centered approach to care
planning and implementation guides all Medicaid HCBS waiver program policies and practices.
 Specific aims guiding this study are to, in the CHCPE participant population:
Aim 1: Determine how living with ADRD is associated with health service utilization, including emergency
department visits, hospitalizations, and post-acute or long-term admission to nursing homes.
Aim 2: Determine whether strength of the informal caregiver support system is associated with utilization of all
health services under study, according to ADRD status and racial and ethnic group membership.
Aim 3: Determine how living with ADRD, and racial and ethnic group membership, are associated with meeting
self-identified goals of care and person-centered outcomes based on their HCBS-related experiences.
 The study team will disseminate findings to state Medicaid officials and other stakeholders concerned
with how best to help CHCPE clients living with ADRD avoid or delay adverse health outcomes and achieve self-
identified goals of care. Dissemination activities also will include presentations at annual meetings of relevant
national professional and scientific organizations, and publications in relevant peer-reviewed journals."
10873692,"The University of Rochester (UR) has a long and extraordinarily rich history of providing first-rate clinical services
to persons with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD), and in driving new discoveries through
research that create increased opportunity for individuals with IDD to live their lives to the fullest of their potential.
This proposed UR-IDDRC is founded upon a revolutionary philosophy of medicine, first introduced here at UR
Medical Center by Profs. George Engel and Jon Romano in 1977: The Biopsychosocial Model. This simple,
yet profound idea, that the person seeking treatment is not merely a product of their biology, but rather, is also
an amalgam of their psychology and socio-economic circumstances, places the whole person in all their
complexity at the center of medicine. If ever there was a population that deserves to be recognized and treated
in this holistic humanistic manner, it is those with an IDD. This UR-IDDRC places persons with IDD at the center
of our inclusive neurodiverse mission, and commits to providing excellence in our basic, translational and clinical
research, with a singular focus on providing tractable clinical solutions for these individuals. In the pages of this
program application, we describe the Center’s crucial scientific infrastructure, which supports four cutting-edge
Cores that elevate and accelerate the work of our 105 UR-IDDRC investigators, providing the very latest
available technologies and expertise with high efficiency and excellent cost-effectiveness. These Cores are:
Human Phenotyping & Recruitment (HPR); Translational Neuroimaging & Neurophysiology (TNN); Cell &
Molecular Imaging (CMI); and Animal Behavior and Neurophysiology (ABN). Through vigorous leadership and
in close consultation with our UR-IDDRC community and the five key advisory committees that provide counsel
to our Administrative Core (ADM), we articulate a set of five research foci that embrace key and established
research strengths at our institution while also seeking to expand our program into important areas of concern
to the larger IDD community. These are: (1) Rare and orphaned diseases of neurodevelopment; (2) Parental
stress and early life exposure as determinants of brain development; (3) Neuroinflammatory mechanisms in
pathological brain development; (4) Autism spectrum disorder; (5) Multisensory and sensorimotor integration.
Some 202 ongoing IDD projects, and 9 associated training grants, are supported by this infrastructure, and the
Center Leadership is committed to further growing this already thriving program by attracting and training new
young investigators and clinicians in IDD research. Major efforts to disseminate the work of the Center through
media outlets and culturally competent multilingual publications, oriented at our community, are in place.
Outreach to our IDD community and the public at large is a central concern of the UR-IDDRC. Leveraging the
enormous financial commitment of the University of Rochester’s leadership to developing the UR-IDDRC, and
through a philanthropy-driven annual pilot grant fund of $400,000, UR-IDDRC leadership is strongly positioned
to prosecute an innovative transformative IDD research agenda over the proposed five-year term of this program."
10915486,"Founded in 1965 as one of the original Intellectual and Developmental Disorders Research Centers
(IDDRC), the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center (VKC) IDDRC serves as the central nexus across Vanderbilt for
interdisciplinary research, communication, and training in intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). The
VKC IDDRC serves as a trans-institutional institute that brings together over 200 faculty from 38 departments
in 10 schools at Vanderbilt. The VKC’s mission to facilitate discoveries that inform best practices to improve
the lives of people with IDD and their families. This mission is met by leveraging our outstanding institutional
resources and support, partnering with disability communities, and capitalizing on synergistic interactions
across the VKC’s federally-designated centers: the VKC IDDRC, a University Center of Excellence in
Developmental Disabilities and a Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental Disabilities program. The
IDDRC as the centerpiece of the VKC is the foundational organizing structure that creates a “Center culture”
wherein research and discovery permeates the VKC’s broader training and service activities, thus enhancing
the translational research goals of the IDDRC. Demonstrable IDDRC success includes 976 investigator-
authored publications and robust NIH funding to Vanderbilt to support IDD-related research ($52.6M in FY20).
Harnessing and leveraging this trans-institutional strength to focus on unique challenges in IDD, the
overarching goal of the next phase of the IDDRC is to develop precision care for IDD by providing
infrastructure and scientific leadership to enable rapid translation of basic discoveries into high-
impact IDD interventions and treatments. Three global Aims guide the IDDRC’s work. Aim 1 provides core
services to enable and disseminate impactful research on individualizing treatments based upon the causes,
mechanisms, and contributing co-morbid sequelae of IDD; Aim 2 focuses on incorporating innovative methods
and approaches to enhance multidisciplinary IDD research; and Aim 3 proposes to conduct a signature
research project to improve the precision use of antipsychotic medication in people with autism. Across these
Aims and five Cores supported by the IDDRC (Administrative, Clinical Translational, Translational
Neuroscience, Behavioral Phenotyping, and Data Sciences), three themes permeate our work: (1) recruitment
of highly-skilled researchers not currently conducting IDD research (non-traditional researchers); (2) inclusion
of IDD participants into research studies that currently do not include IDD (non-traditional subjects); and (3)
incorporation of novel scientific approaches and methods (non-traditional approaches). Our IDDRC is ideally
posed to enable rapid discovery of precision care approaches by supporting 50 investigators leading 70
research projects (15 from NICHD) and, as highlighted by the Signature Research Project, to promote and
implement generative, novel, and impactful research directions, thus meeting the NICHD’s vision of applying
newly evolved technologies and approaches to rapidly accelerate the prevention and/or amelioration of IDDs."
10773068,"ABSTRACT: The intersection of healthcare and biomedical research is at an inflection point with the
convergence of the digital revolution, advances in imaging, nanotechnology, big data science, and
precision or personalized medicine. There is a wealth of meaningful, but complex information that could
be extracted from imaging data but is not optimally utilized for patient care. Cancer care exemplifies the
current challenges which include early detection, accurate distinction of pre- neoplastic and neoplastic
lesions, prediction of tumor aggressiveness, determining infiltrative tumor margins during surgical
treatment, tracking tumor evolution/ metastasis pattern, recurrence, and potential acquired resistance to
treatments over time. Major strides have been made in the personalization of cancer therapies such as
immunotherapy, but the availability of specific, relevant, and timely medical data and information is of
critical importance to realizing the full potential of precision medicine. Nowhere is this more acutely
evident than during interventions in the operating and procedure rooms. Novel methods of image
guidance, data integration, information extraction, and knowledge transfer are needed to enable
clinicians to fully leverage the information available, especially before, during and after invasive
procedures. We are excited to re-submit a proposal for a new P41 biomedical resource center (BTRC)
called Advanced Technologies for NCIGT(AT-NCIGT) with 3 TRDs, 10 new collaborative and 10 new
service projects, all of which aim to investigate develop and disseminate new technologies for image
guided therapy (IGT). The 3 components are Imaging Cancer Heterogeneity for IGT, Deep Learning
for IGT and Intraoperative devices for IGT. These new technologies alone and in combinations will
allow for greater understanding of disease state, treatment guidance, integration/navigation and in-vivo
monitoring of tissue responses and improve the precision of invasive procedures.
Thus the overall goal of this proposal is to investigate, develop and disseminate novel technologies for
extracting new tissue characteristics (technology research and development core TRD 1: Imaging cancer
heterogeneity; analyze them and make them available through state-of-the-art algorithmic and data
curation approaches (Deep Learning TRD 2); and enable precise tissue sampling surgical navigation and
in-vivo tissue response through the results of novel Intraoperative devices (Intraoperative devices for
IGT: TRD 3). In order to effectively disseminate all this new knowledge we have 10 new collaborative and
10 new service projects and will share these novel tools through our established mechanisms, from
current BTRC- National Center for Image Guided Therapy (NCIGT), which continues to be dedicated to
the innovating for IGT into interventional radiology, surgery, radiation oncology, and procedure-based
medicine."
10770460,"INTRODUCTION TO REVISED APPLICATION
The A0 grant was submitted in May 2019, before Prof. Alexander Barnes moved to ETH-Zurich and before Prof.
Chad Rienstra was recruited to UW-Madison. Now Rienstra is officially a Full Professor at UW-Madison, after
having negotiated major investments in the solid-state NMR (SSNMR) program at NMRFAM (new and/or moving
from Illinois) including three shielded 600 MHz magnets, one 750 MHz wide bore magnet, four spectrometers,
several custom-designed magic-angle spinning (MAS) probes at 600-750 MHz, and upgrades to the 900 MHz
spectrometer, which immediately have had an impact on data collection for DBP6 in late 2019 and for other
experiments in progress during early 2020.
Furthermore, the National Science Foundation Mid-Scale Research Infrastructure-2 proposal on ""Network for
Advanced NMR"", which was submitted by UW-Madison PIs (Rienstra and Henzler-Wildman) in collaboration
with Jeff Hoch at UConn Health and Art Edison at U. Georgia, is in late stages of negotiation and review with
NSF. If funded, this grant would bring a 1.1 GHz dedicated SSNMR spectrometer to NMRFAM in ~2022-23.
These developments have motivated several changes to this A1 application which more explicitly emphasizes
the SSNMR program at NMRFAM:
 (1) Rienstra is now contact PI and Henzler-Wildman co-PI.
 (2) TR&D1 now includes sub-aims targeting development of micro-rotor packing and sample manipulation
 tools to leverage recent breakthroughs in ultra-fast MAS (>100 kHz) at <1 mm rotor diameters; this
 broadens the scope and impact of TR&D 1. Baselines and benchmarks for NMR under gradients are also
 more clearly described and proof-of-principle experiments are in place.
 (3) TR&D2 now addresses critical bottlenecks in SSNMR data collection, emphasizing:
 (a) automation for parameter optimization and spectrometer configuration;
 (b) new narrow bore magic-angle spinning probe designs at 600-900 MHz (that will be applicable at 1.1
 GHz and higher in the future); and
 (c) real-time feedback interaction with data processing (TR&D3).
 (4) TR&D3 now leverages NMRFAM software products and continuing technology development for solid-
 state NMR, including assignment, structure determination, refinement and validation tools, and it is more
 clearly integrated with the rest of the proposal.
 (5) DBPs 5, 6 and 7 have been changed to include well-developed and impactful collaborations between
 Rienstra and Paul Kotzbauer (Wash. U. Medicine, Lewy bodies and synucleiopathies), Marty Burke (U.
 Illinois, antifungal drugs), and James Morrissey (U. Michigan, blood coagulation).
Overall the proposal is now organized in (we think) a more logical/chronological manner, with TR&D1
emphasizing samples, TR&D2 the spectrometer and probes, and TR&D3 the software and analysis procedures.
The proposal body further explains how these developments greatly augment the cost-benefit ratio for the project
and integrate with the current user program and the long-term vision of NMRFAM.
The revisions also address the overarching concerns of reviewers of the A0 application including ""narrow
scope/modest innovation in TR&D1""; ""weak integration of TR&D3""; cost-benefit ratio; preliminary data; solution
vs. solids emphasis of TR&D3; innovation; context (addressing competing ideas and precedents); and specificity
of outcomes. Finally, we have clarified the premise and approach with respect to asymmetry in membrane
proteins."
10651903,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Iatrogenic nerve injury is one of the most feared complications of surgery. Nerves are critically important
to the function of most tissues and nerve injury can lead to permanent disability. Surgery is performed commonly
in the U.S. with approximately 40 million operations annually, incurring up to 600,000 iatrogenic nerve injuries.
One procedure particularly plagued by nerve damage is radical prostatectomy (RP), where nerve damage occurs
in up to 60% of patients, despite the practice of nerve sparing surgical methods for >30 years. At present there
is no clinically approved technology to improve visual recognition of nerve tissue during surgery, leaving
surgeons to rely largely on anatomical knowledge to locate small or buried nerves invisible to the naked eye.
Fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) is a nascent field with demonstrated efficacy in improving surgical outcomes
for cancer resection and normal anatomy preservation using molecularly-targeted fluorophores and commercial
FGS imaging systems. We have developed several first-in-kind, targeted, near-infrared (NIR) fluorophores that
label nerve tissue with high affinity—to date the most promising is IT01-08. IT01-08 specifically labels rodent,
swine and canine nerves following systemic administration and demonstrates cross reactivity in ex vivo human
specimen staining. Notably, we have developed a library of IT01-08 derivatives, several of which have displayed
vastly improved water solubilities and toxicity profiles in preliminary testing, increasing the no observed adverse
effect level (NOAEL) doses 2-10X. Final solubility, toxicology, and pharmacology testing is required to select a
lead compound from IT01-08 and its derivatives. Following lead compound selection, clinical translation of the
optimal NIR nerve-specific fluorophore will enhance nerve identification during nerve-sparing RP, resulting in
reduced nerve injury and improved patient outcomes. This study’s immediate milestones include – Phase I: (1)
selection of a clinically viable, NIR nerve-specific fluorophore for translation, (2) relevant pharmacokinetics, dose
ranging pharmacodynamics, and biodistribution quantification, and (3) preliminary toxicology analysis to guide
investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies. Phase II: (4) good laboratory practice (GLP) synthesized
fluorophore and formulation product for, (5) a GLP two-species pharmacology and toxicology (pharm/tox) study
facilitating, (6) a successful IND application to the FDA. Our long-term strategic plan is to develop our NIR nerve-
specific fluorophores for human use to enhance the identification and preservation of nerves with broad clinical
impact for all surgical subspecialties. Completion of the proposed aims will establish pre-clinical testing of these
promising nerve highlighting agents towards first-in-human trials and provide a strong foundation for industry
partnerships and investment for clinical translation."
10795701,"ABSTRACT
A traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a well-known risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. There is not a one-to-one
relationship, where a TBI will lead to the development of Alzheimer's disease. The lack of a direct connection
suggests a selective vulnerability. Problematically, when a person has a mild TBI, it is not possible to know if
they will recover without an impact on their brain health or if they have now increased their vulnerability to
developing Alzheimer's disease. What can be done? One approach is a broad administration of therapy shortly
after the injury. Since this approach requires treating some people who would recover from the TBI without
intervention, the benefit-to-risk ratio must be very high. That is, you do not want to cause harm by giving an
unneeded drug. Our long-term goal is to identify safe treatments to be used after a mild TBI in an older adult
population to lessen the chance of developing Alzheimer's disease. There are currently no FDA approved
drugs to be used after a mild TBI to reduce secondary injury mechanisms. We believe that not treating after a
mild TBI is a missed opportunity, but the treatment needs to be safe. Our preliminary evidence shows that a
TBI causes deficits in energy metabolism and increased neuroinflammation, both of which are exacerbated by
preexisting proteinopathies, such as amyloid-beta. To target these mechanisms, we have identified Beta-
hydroxybutyrate (BHB; 3-hydroxybutyric acid) as a safe multimodal intervention. BHB is a ketone body, which
is continuously produced by the liver at low levels but can rise above 1mM during periods of fasting, calorie
restriction, prolonged exercise, or by the ketogenic diet. Clinically, BHB is safe to be administered orally, BHB
rapidly crosses the blood-brain-barrier, and in cases of starvation, ketones can provide as much as 70% of the
brain's energy. BHB is an alternative biofuel, that can bypass blockages in the electron transport system
caused by amyloid-beta, and TBI, which decrease mitochondrial bioenergetics. BHB has also been shown to
suppress inflammation via an inflammasome-dependent mechanism and by binding to a recently deorphanized
GPCR called HCA2. We will test the central hypothesis that BHB will be effective at reducing functional
deficits seen in APP/PS1 KI mice following a mild TBI through both energetic and neuroinflammatory
dependent mechanisms, in three specific aims (SA). SA1: Dose-dependent effects of BHB on mitochondrial
function and neuroinflammation after TBI. SA2: Define the immunomodulatory properties of the HCA2
receptor, via dose-dependent effects of niacin, a high-affinity HCA2 agonist. SA3: Define the
immunomodulatory properties BHB through the HCA2 receptor through loss of function experiment. Our work
seeks to address the mechanisms associated with the increased fragility of the older brain which keeps it from
recovering from a mild TBI. We also will define the therapeutic potential of the BHB/HCA2 axis as a post-TBI
neuroprotective strategy for use in a population at risk for Alzheimer's disease."
11015368,"African Americans are more than twice as likely to have Alzheimer’s disease/Alzheimer’s disease related dementias (AD/ADRD) as Whites. This is a preventable gap. The simple yet innovative long-term vision of this LEADR proposal is to erase racial disparities in AD/ADRD burden. In this project, we will 1) develop a measure of structural discrimination and resilience, 2) use it to predict outcomes in AD/ADRD and 3) develop interventions to decrease prevalence and increase resilience. Understanding how to equalize the Black and White AD/ADRD burden will reveal mechanisms that will optimize prevention and care for all. With historical data, innovative approaches, and a commitment to addressing this disparity, we can achieve this objective. The functional impact of AD/ADRD is never due solely to individual decline; it reflects interactions between a person’s decline, their ability to compensate, and the demands of the environment. The resilience to compensate is not just an individual matter, it has many domains including the ability to use remaining intact brain function, coping skills, family support, physical layout of the home, and multiple community and policy factors. Although structural discrimination and resilience are relevant to AD/ADRD and function, there are currently no measurement instruments. We will use the sequential exploratory mixed methods Instrument Design Model in which researchers incorporate key stakeholders into the instrument design process. This instrument will measure eight dimensions of structural discrimination and resilience plus family support, greenspace, and social connection. Zip codes across the lifespan will be used to merge historical data to measure multiple risk or protective factors such as school district funding, environmental toxins, and amount of accessible greenspace. We will construct the instrument with older adults and researchers, cognitively test, pilot test, refine and then field the instrument in national datasets supported by the NIH. The intervention development stage will include: 1) insights from the previous qualitative portions; 2) results of the data collection phase; 3) insights from a larger stakeholder groups of policy makers, researchers, advocates, people living with AD/ADRD and their families to review findings and identify potential intervention mechanisms. This program of work will move beyond individual and family interventions to address the structural determinants of AD/ADRD. Developing a reliable, valid measure of structural racial discrimination, being able to test its role in AD/ADRD, and then to use it as a framework for developing population-level interventions, is a high-risk, high-reward goal - worthy of the NIH investment in AD/ADRD. A significant side benefit is that because many other conditions related to structural discrimination are also on the causal pathway to AD/ADRD, this effort will also enhance our understanding of hypertension, stroke, heart disease, and other inflammatory diseases. The project uses the distinct strengths of the applicant, the outstanding research environment, and existing NIA resources to work towards solving crucial disparities that tax families and society."
10805360,"ABSTRACT – Center for Virtual Imaging Trials
The accelerating complexity of medical imaging devices and methods has largely outpaced the field's ability to
evaluate and optimize their design and clinical use. Doing so through clinical trials is often not feasible or
definitive due to ethical limitations, expense, time requirements, and/or a fundamental lack of ground truth
(exact patient anatomy and condition). Most current approaches to assess imaging technologies outside of
clinical trials rely on simplistic models and subjective perception of image aesthetics, and results cannot readily
predict clinical efficacy. To fill this gap, the broad objective of the Center for Virtual Imaging Trials is to develop
a virtual platform for assessing the effectiveness of medical imaging systems and methods for specific clinical
tasks. The initial focus is on computed tomography (CT), both due to its widespread medical utility and its
status as the largest source of medical radiation. Virtual imaging trials offer an efficient means to evaluate
imaging concepts and technologies in silico by simulating the patient, imaging system, and image evaluation.
Such virtual trials can be conducted quickly and cost effectively on a computer, providing researchers a
practical way to answer fundamental questions using the precise controls and the exact knowledge of a
modeled patient. They also enable objective optimization of current and emerging imaging technologies
(hardware and software) to minimize radiation risk and provide quantitative accuracy. By accelerating and
improving imaging technologies' evaluation and optimization, virtual trials support quality, safety, and effective
practice of patient-centered care.
To achieve its objective, the Center will develop, refine, and disseminate the essential resources to realistically
model and represent a) patients, b) imaging systems, and c) image evaluation. These resources comprise the
three Technology Research and Development (TRD) projects, which work synergistically with and provide
resources to Collaborative Projects (CPs) and Service Projects (SPs). A Technology Training and
Dissemination (TTD) component will distribute the Center's resources and provide the necessary training.
Administration provides infrastructure, oversight, and integration. The overall Specific Aims are to (1) develop,
consolidate, and streamline the required components to enable virtual imaging trials of existing and emerging
CT imaging methods, (2) position virtual trials as an alternative methodology to quantify, evaluate, and
optimize CT imaging, and (3) disseminate to the research community validated tools for efficient virtual trials in
CT and train researchers to use them effectively. Using state-of-the-art simulation and analysis methods, the
Center will provide the first comprehensive platform to assess the diagnostic capability of imaging technologies
in their complete trajectory from design to use. The Center will have a notable impact on rigorous and
reproducible scientific design, prediction, and practice of medical imaging, starting with CT, leading to
measured reductions in radiation dose, improvements in image quality, and advancement of precision imaging."

10609963,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Dementia is a major health problem in the United States. Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and
dementia (VCID) is the second leading cause of dementia behind Alzheimer’s disease (AD) but despite the
massive impact of VCID in the expanding elderly population, its pathogenesis is still only poorly understood.
The consensus is that in the aging brain, particularly on a background of hypertension, blood vessels undergo
degenerative changes, resulting in loss of blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and increased vascular
resistance, which together, lead to cerebral hypoperfusion, neuronal damage and cognitive decline. Recently,
we described a novel role for microglia in the maintenance of vascular integrity. We demonstrated that chronic
mild hypoxia (CMH; 8% O2) induces transient vascular leak in spinal cord blood vessels in young (10 weeks
old) mice, that is associated with microglial activation and clustering around leaky blood vessels. Interestingly,
microglial depletion profoundly increased vascular leak and this was associated with astrocyte-vascular
uncoupling and loss of vascular tight junction proteins, suggesting that microglia play an important protective
role in maintaining vascular integrity in the spinal cord. We have since found that CMH also triggers vascular
leak in the brain and that microglial depletion exacerbates this leak. Strikingly, in aged (20 months old) mice,
the extent of hypoxic-induced cerebrovascular disruption is greatly enhanced, as shown by increased vascular
leak and the emergence of microhemorrhages, though the impact of microglial depletion in aged mice has yet
to be addressed. Together, our data suggests that microglia play an important vasculoprotective role in young
mice, but this mechanism may be less effective in the aged brain. Taken with the observation that aging
induces the appearance of a “primed”, pro-inflammatory, destructive microglial phenotype, we hypothesize
that: (i) mild hypoxia triggers vascular leak and microhemorrhage in the brain, resulting in neuronal
damage and cognitive decline, (ii) vascular disruption is worse in the aged and the hypertensive, (iii)
microglia play an important vasculoprotective role in stabilizing the BBB, but this declines with age,
and (iv) repopulating the aged brain with young microglia or attenuation of microglial activation state,
could stabilize the BBB and reduce cognitive impairment. To investigate these hypotheses, we propose
three specific aims: (1) characterize hypoxia-induced vascular leak in the brain and define how this is
influenced by age, gender, severity of hypoxia, hypertension and brain region, (2) define the contribution of
microglia in preventing hypoxia-induced cerebrovascular leak in young and aged mice, and (3) demonstrate
that hypoxia-induced BBB disruption and cognitive impairment are reduced by repopulating the aged brain with
“young” microglia or by attenuating microglial activation state. These studies will provide important insight into
the link between hypoxic exposure, BBB disruption, neuronal damage and cognitive decline, and inform on the
therapeutic potential of manipulating microglial behavior in the aged brain to restore vasculoprotective function."

The ongoing goal of the Autism Biomarkers Consortium for Clinical Trials (ABC-CT) is to establish
electroencephalography (EEG) and eye-tracking (ET) biomarkers that can be used for stratification and/or as
sensitive and reliable objective assays related to social function in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) clinical trials.
This renewal application seeks to further validate promising measures through three studies designed to
enhance and extend the original ABC-CT study: (1) a confirmation study of the original findings in a new cohort
using similar design (T1: Baseline, T2: 6 weeks post baseline, T3: 24 weeks post baseline) and sample
size/characteristics (200 with ASD, 200 with typical development (TD)); (2) a follow-up study of the original cohort
(N=399) to re-administer the biomarker and clinical batteries 2.5-4 years after original ABC-CT enrollment; (3) a
feasibility study of parallel EEG and ET biomarkers in preschool-aged (3-5-year-old) children (25 with ASD, 25
with TD). The biomarker and clinical batteries measure key facets of social-communication in ASD using well-
validated paradigms appropriate for the intended developmental and cognitive range. The study will rely on the
same leadership and five Collaborating Implementation Sites (“Sites”) from the first phase, all highly experienced
in multi-site collaborative clinical research using the proposed clinical, EEG, and ET methodologies. The Data
Coordinating Core (DCC) will provide a secure informatics infrastructure for communication and data integration
across the consortium to ensure organized data management, quality control, and reliable upload to the National
Database for Autism Research (NDAR) and NIH Data Repositories. The Data Acquisition and Analysis Core
(DAAC) will oversee consistent use of scientific standards and methodological rigor for data acquisition,
processing, and analytics. The Administrative Core, in coordination with federal partners in this cooperative
agreement, will oversee the operations of the sites, DCC, and DAAC to ensure methodologically and ethically
rigorous, efficient completion of study aims: 1) In the confirmation study with a new cohort, evaluate whether
EEG and ET measures, individually or in combination, have utility as stratification biomarkers and/or sensitive,
reliable measures of change in clinical trials; 2) In the follow-up study of the original ABC-CT cohort, assess
long-term stability, sensitivity to change, and longitudinal predictive value of the markers; 3) In the feasibility
study, determine the viability of parallel EEG and ET measures as potential biomarkers in 3-5-year-old children
with ASD and TD. Blood (DNA) samples will be collected from participants with ASD and biological parents for
future genomic analyses, and raw, processed, and analyzed data will be shared to create a community resource
accessible for use by all qualified investigators. These objectives are designed to further develop promising
biomarkers to advance qualification with the FDA Biomarker Qualification Program."

Older adults with multiple chronic conditions (MCC), especially those with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD), have an increased risk of polypharmacy, adverse drug events, treatment burden, and cognitive changes from medication side effects. Deprescribing is the process of reducing or stopping inappropriate medications or medications unlikely to be beneficial supervised by a health-care professional. Patients, caregivers for people with ADRD, and clinicians list potential adverse drug withdrawal events (ADWE) following medication discontinuation as a key barrier to deprescribing. ADWE are not well reported by deprescribing trials, and no large-scale interventions have reported prevalence or predictors of ADWE. Further, ADWE presenting in ambulatory care are rarely captured. This lack of evidence is largely due to inadequate methods for measuring ADWE: Identifying and measuring ADWE requires knowing the timing of medication discontinuation and understanding whether subsequent symptoms or diagnoses constitute ADWE. Our experience with safety monitoring for the OPTMIZE intervention of deprescribing education in ADRD (R33AG057289, MPIs Bayliss / Boyd), a pragmatic, cluster randomized trial to increase deprescribing awareness among patients with ADRD, their family, and primary care clinicians, has exemplified these methodologic gaps and provided the impetus for the proposed work. The project will leverage knowledge and methods from safety monitoring for the ADRD population in OPTIMIZE, combined with rich longitudinal clinical and pharmacy data from the Kaiser Permanente Colorado (KPCO) EHR and Virtual Data Warehouse (VDW) to develop and test methods to generate robust evidence on deprescribing safety. Our study populations will be older adults with MCC and the OPTIMIZE population with dementia plus MCC. Aim 1 will identify individuals who experience medication discontinuation and subsequent ADWE using record review and adjudication. Aim 2 will develop and validate a text mining tool to identify medication discontinuation applicable to multiple classes of medications. Aim 3 will apply the text mining tool in combination with common ADWE diagnoses in two separate cohorts to demonstrate a data-based approach to identifying medication discontinuation and possible ADWE: a sample of older adults with MCC and the OPTIMIZE population of individuals with dementia plus MCC. Aim 4 will model patient and clinical factors predictive of ADWE in the ADRD and MCC populations. Generating adequate evidence to support safe and effective deprescribing for ADRD and MCC populations requires new data-based methods and approaches."

The Pacific Island Partnership for Cancer Health Equity (PIPCHE) is a 17-year collaboration between the
University of Guam (UOG) and the University of Hawai‘i Cancer Center (UHCC) that continues to advance
cancer health equity, increase the cancer research and education capacity, and decrease significant cancer
disparities in Pacific Islands Populations. Americans of Pacific Islander ancestry are a highly underserved and
vulnerable minority with a disparate cancer burden, including significant underrepresentation among cancer
and biomedical researchers and healthcare providers, which further exacerbates the disparities. The
overarching goal and long-term objective are to promote cancer health equity and mitigate the impact of cancer
on Pacific Island Populations through increasing cancer research leadership and capacity in Hawai‘i, Guam
and the United States Affiliated Pacific Islands, which comprise the Pacific Island Populations addressed by
this project. As the only National Cancer Institute-funded Partnership serving the underrepresented Pacific
Island region, PIPCHE will accomplish its goals through the following specific aims: (1) Continue to develop a
diverse portfolio of Pacific Island Population-focused cancer research projects that include clinical, basic, and
population health sciences, (2) Collaborate with local and regional Pacific Island community organizations that
work with underrepresented Pacific Island Populations to promote cancer health equity and enhance
opportunities for research training and workforce development, (3) Sustain, strengthen, and continuously
evaluate of all the Partnership’s research, core activities, and research education programs, (4) Enhance and
implement evidence-based, relevant, cancer-related public health interventions and cancer, prevention and
control strategies with and within underrepresented communities, and (5) Expand the scientific collaboration
among PIPCHE members and other faculty within the two institutions, with an emphasis on recruiting Early
Stage Investigators of Pacific Island ancestry. PIPCHE will carry out these aims by continued investment in
four Cores (Cancer Outreach, Research Education, Planning and Evaluation, and Administration), which
provide the infrastructure and governance of the Partnership. The proposed Shared Resources (Biostatistics,
Epidemiology, Information Technology, and Cancer Registry) will provide essential technical and scientific
support to the PIPCHE student scholars, trainees, and the proposed full research projects and pilot projects
that specifically address the cancer disparities of the Pacific Island Populations. Using its arc of cancer equity,
PIPCHE has identified 10 major domains (education/health literacy, policy, environment, lifestyle,
culture/community, biology, treatment, healthcare access, psycho-social, and socio-economic status) that
influence Pacific Islander cancer health disparities/equity. Each of the research projects, cores, and
infrastructure affects one or more of the domains, and therefore knowledge about the action of PIPCHE’s work
is value added and helpful, as individuals as a team, while working towards Pacific cancer health equity."
10788287,"Acute care research can be defined as investigations into preventive, curative, rehabilitative, or palliative
actions that depend on time-sensitive and urgent intervention. Thus, acute care encompasses multiple medical
specialties, including critical care services, emergency and urgent care, trauma and acute care surgery, and
neurocritical care. In rural states, the need for improvements in acute care and acute care research are
pressing, as medical advances have increased the disparities between urban and rural areas. These
disparities are due in large part to imbalances in access to specialty-trained clinicians, resources and facilities,
as well as clinical research. We propose a new inter-departmental Center for Biomedical Research Excellence
(COBRE) at Maine Medical Center, a tertiary care center located in the largest population center (Portland) in
the state of Maine. Serving as the hub of activities, this program will mentor cohorts of acute care researchers
in significant clinical/translational areas of need while providing a foundation for these studies to impact
communities and patients in all regions of our state. This COBRE is led by Douglas Sawyer MD, PhD, an
established leader in clinical care services, mentorship, and translational research. The aims of this program
are: 1) Provide the leadership, governance, and advisory network to establish a COBRE in Acute Care
Research and Rural Disparities at Maine Medical Center; 2) Provide project and mentorship support to launch
the careers of promising clinician-scientists within this scientific program, and help ensure their long-term
scientific success as independent researchers; 3) Enhance the capabilities of Maine Medical Center's core
facilities and research infrastructure to support human subject research of both our COBRE investigators and
other institutional and external researchers, and to stimulate innovative research methodologies and new
collaborations, and 4) Enhance our existing COBRE- and CTR-supported pilot project programs to focus on
translational and clinical opportunities related to acute care and rural health disparities. In Phase I, we have
initially selected 4 clinical/translational project leaders with clinical research areas of primary need. These
include: Teresa May DO, a critical care physician-researcher developing a standardized statewide system of
cardiac arrest post-resuscitation care, David Gagnon PharmD, a pharmacist-researcher testing the benefits of
prophylactic antibiotics in cardiac arrest survivors, David Seder MD, a critical care physician-researcher
expanding his clinical research program to include translational molecular signaling studies of inflammation in
cardiac arrest, and Alexa Craig MD, a pediatric neurologist engaged in research utilizing telemedicine to
improve survival and neurological outcomes for newborns born at risk for encephalopathy. These researchers
will be supported by a robust mentorship and advisory network and a Community Engagement, Bioethics, and
Outreach Core that will develop state-wide health professional and community partnerships in a learning
healthcare system to enhance understanding of and increase inclusion in human subjects research."
10755701,"The central theme of our PPG is that HDL function is a critical determinant of atherogenesis and cardiovascular
risk in chronic human disease. The goal of our research is to define the mechanisms for HDL functional loss in
diseases associated with increased risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD): Familial
Hypercholesterolemia (FH), Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). A major hypothesis
of the PPG is that dysfunctional HDL contributes to the residual inflammatory risk of cardiovascular events.
Reactive dicarbonyls including MDA, IsoLG, and ONE are highly reactive species that rapidly adduct to apoAI
and HDL phospholipids impairing HDL function. A major recent advance by our PPG is the discovery that two
different small molecule dicarbonyl scavengers, 2-HOBA and PPM, improve HDL function, reduce LDL oxidation,
and dramatically reduce atherosclerosis in Ldlr-/- deficient mice, a model of FH, in the absence of changes in
plasma lipid levels. The atherosclerotic lesions showed a dramatic decrease in necrosis and inflammation and
had evidence for reduced efferocytosis. Projects 1 and 4 will both explore the hypothesis that reactive carbonyl-
induced HDL dysfunction will impair macrophage efferocytosis. Project 1 will test the hypothesis that dicarbonyl
scavengers promote remodeling of established atherosclerosis with resolution of inflammation. These studies
will set the stage for a translational proof of concept study to test the hypothesis that the dicarbonyl scavenger
2-HOBA will inhibit modification of apoAI and HDL and improve HDL functions in humans with heterozygous FH
and subjects with CAD without FH. Interestingly, we have recently discovered that lipoproteins are highly-
enriched with small RNAs derived from bacterial and fungal species in the microbiome and environment
(msRNA). Another major theme is that msRNA carried by HDL influence HDL function and atherogenesis. Project
2 will examine the hypothesis that CKD increases mesenteric lymphatic output and apoAI harboring harmful
bioactive substances (IsoLG, miRNA, msRNA) that contribute to the increased risk of ASCVD. Importantly,
microbial sRNAs are present in human and mouse atherosclerotic lesions. Project 3 will examine the hypothesis
that HDL removes microbial sRNAs from lesion macrophages and suppresses pro-inflammatory gene
expression through retro-endocytosis and msRNA acceptance. In addition, we will target macrophage TLR7/8
activation in vivo using non-targeting locked-nucleic acids (ntLNA) to inhibit atherosclerosis progression and
promote regression. Project 4 will elucidate mechanisms whereby dicarbonyl modified lipoproteins potentiate
inflammation and cell death in macrophages and determine if these alterations contribute to reduced
efferocytosis. Overall, the proposed studies will advance our understanding of the role of HDL function in human
disease and identify new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of ASCVD. There are 4 Cores: Core A.

10891768,"ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Abnormal circadian rhythms of locomotor activities, body temperature, and hormonal levels not only are strongly
associated many neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in both human patients and
animal models, but also precede cognitive deficits. However, it is unclear whether and how circadian disruption
per se causes cognitive deficits. It is also unclear whether and how the central circadian clock in the
suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus contributes to cognitive functions. Here we found that an
AD mouse model (APP NL-G-F) displays disrupted SCN molecular clock, including nuclear receptors Rev-erbα
and Rev-erbβ, and these molecular deficits proceed detectable cognitive dysfunctions. Circadian disruptions,
either by constant light exposure or by genetic deletion of Rev-erb in the SCN GABAergic neurons, cause
cognitive dysfunctions resembling those in APP NL-G-F mice. We hypothesize that disrupted circadian clock in
the SCN and alterations in SCN-originated neural circuitry contributes to cognitive dysfunctions in AD. We will
determine whether restoration of Rev-erb in the SCN rescues cognitive deficits in APP NL-G-F mice; determine
whether rhythmic SCN GABA neuron firing pattern is required to maintain normal cognitive functions; and
determine whether the GABA-SCN>PVT circuit regulates cognitive functions. Modern human society is featured
with nighttime light, nighttime feeding, social jetlag, and shift work. These circadian disruptions are highly
associated with memory deficits and neurodegenerative diseases, especially in aged populations. The proposed
study combines unique genetic animal models, light schedule manipulation, precise neuromodulation tools, and
cutting-edge molecular methods to address mechanisms of how circadian disruptions cause cognitive deficits.
Accomplishing these aims will provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of AD-related dementia, and lay
groundwork for chronotherapeutic interventions."
10897803,"Overall Abstract
Sub-Saharan Africa contains 70% of the world’s diagnosed cases of HIV/AIDS, with both Uganda and Kenya at
its epicenter (12% and 7% prevalence, respectively). Within East Africa, cervical cancer remains one of the most
common malignancies in women. HIV is a contributing factor for cervical carcinogenesis with HIV-infected
women having a greater incidence and persistence of human papilloma virus (HPV) infections, cervical cancer,
and precancerous cervical lesions. In contrast to other HIV-associated cancers, the incidence of cervical cancer
has not declined in the era of antiretroviral therapy.
The core objective of this application is to better elucidate the natural history of HPV infection and cervical cancer
in HIV-infected women, including the cofactors involved in carcinogenesis, the persistence and progression of
cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) after LEEP, and to identify new viral and cellular biomarkers that will assist
in screening, triage and treatment.
Our central hypothesis is that the incidence, persistence, and spectrum of high risk (HR) HPV are substantially
greater in HIV-infected East African women, and that this explains the higher incidence of cervical neoplasia.
We further hypothesize that these and other modifiable factors, such as aflatoxin ingestion, disproportionately
and adversely influence outcomes of local therapies such as Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure (LEEP)
in HIV-infected women.
The specific aims for the East Africa Consortium for HPV and Cervical Cancer (EACHC) in Women Living with
HIV/AIDS are:
Specific Aim 1. To establish a sustainable research infrastructure for an international partnership to conduct
impactful research in HPV and cervical cancer in women living with HIV/AIDS
Specific Aim 2. To design and execute three integrated projects that advance the knowledge of the
environmental and biologic factors leading to cervical cancer in East Africa:
 Project 1- Preventing cervical cancer in HIV-infected women
 Project 2- Understanding CIN2+ among HIV infected women after LEEP: An epidemiological and
 immunohistochemical study
 Project 3- Determining biological and viral factors associated with clinical progression of cervical dysplasia
 in HIV-infected women

10767819,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Decreased mobility significantly increases the risk of many chronic diseases leading to an acceleration of the
normal aging process. Skeletal degeneration, particularly of the spine and joints, are among the most prevalent
diseases leading to a decline in mobility and to frailty. Frailty, defined as a state of decreased physiologic reserve,
often develops with aging and influences a person’s ability to compensate for the additional burden of disease.
With development of frailty, the natural homeostatic reserve is reduced and the ability of the body to compensate
for perturbations is reduced. Degeneration of the spine and joints can substantially accelerate development of
frailty; however, the underlying pathophysiology of this degeneration in aging and the development and
progression of resulting low back pain (LBP) and osteoarthritis (OA) is not well understood. There is no disease-
modifying treatment for either, largely due to the lack in the understanding of pathophysiology of pain and the
unique cellular signaling changes among OA subtypes.
LBP commonly results from degeneration of the amphiarthrodial spinal joints, with pain correlating most strongly
with changes in vertebral endplate morphology. Degeneration of diarthrodial joints is a set of diverse processes
that are frequently lumped together under the umbrella term “osteoarthritis” but represent a heterogeneous
disease process. Osteoclasts (OC) in both vertebral endplates and subchondral bone undergo senescence
during aging to generate porous sclerotic endplates, uncoupled remodeling in subchondral bone, and senescent
OC secrete Netrin-1 to induce axonal extrusion and innervation that potentially lead to pain. Therefore, we
hypothesize that porous sclerotic endplates and uncoupled remodeling of subchondral bone by
senescent OC lead to skeletal joint degeneration and pain, severely limiting mobility and increasing
frailty to accelerate aging. In Project 1, we will investigate how endplate porosity with aging induces spinal
degeneration and sensory innervation to result in LBP. In Project 2, we will investigate the mechanism of the
translational application of intermittent parathyroid hormone injection (iPTH) – increased intervertebral disc (IVD)
volume to spinal degeneration and reduce endplate nerve innervation and LBP by remodeling of porous sclerotic
endplates. In Projects 3, we will characterize the mechanism of cellular senescence in two different subtypes of
OA: non-traumatic OA that is orchestrated by senescence of pre-OC. Together, these 3 projects, supported by
common Administrative and Biostatistics (Core A) and In Vivo Model and Histology (Core B) Cores, will result
in nuanced understanding of the pathophysiology of joint and spinal degeneration associated with aging and will
provide foundational mechanistic insights for potential therapeutic targets."
11015361,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affects a higher proportion of Hispanics - the fastest growing group of older adults in the U.S. - than Caucasians, and at younger ages. The causes of these differences are unknown, partly due to underrepresentation of Hispanics in AD research. Uncovering the reasons for this disparity may provide insight into the causes of AD and help to develop solutions and is this project's goal. Robust findings have linked the social and physical characteristics of neighborhoods to cognitive health, and the neighborhood - el barrio - is known to be important to Hispanic populations. However, identifying specific contextual and individual factors that affect risk of AD is a complex problem. This project aims to determine the effects of neighborhood factors on AD-like cognitive trajectories in Hispanic Americans, by a novel approach that integrates 1) individual differences revealed by high-dimensional multi-omics (genetic and metabolic molecular markers) and 2) mediation/moderation by family and neighborhood dynamics. Our access to a Mexican American cohort - the San Antonio Mexican American Family Study (SAFS) - will enable us to test if variations in AD-like cognitive trajectories across neighborhoods are explained exclusively by individual characteristics, or depend at least partly on social and physical elements of neighborhoods. SAFS participants have been deeply characterized for almost 30 years, including clinical (cardiometabolic and cognitive trajectories), structural neuroimaging, and environmental data; whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and other -omics (e.g., metabolic profiles, epigenomics, protein and RNA expression patterns). The specific aims of this project are to 1) determine if familism provides protection from AD-like cognitive decline compared to non-AD like cognitive decline in Mexican Americans; 2) analyze the associations between social and built environments of different neighborhoods and AD-like cognitive trajectories, by using online street imagery analysis of 17 neighborhoods within each of which at least 30 SAFS participants reside; 3) detect environmental (social and spatial) signals at neighborhood and family levels, reflected in any high-dimensional metabolomic/lipidomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic biomarkers we find correlated with risk of AD-like cognitive decline; and 4) exploit the results to provide guidance for neighborhood-based projects aimed at decreasing the risk of AD-like cognitive decline, by developing a strategic communication toolkit, and convening a forum that will engage diverse stakeholders, particularly neighborhood designers and city planners. Overall, the results will elucidate pathways through which neighborhood-specific factors contribute to AD-like cognitive decline in Hispanics, offering new approaches to mitigation of AD."

peptide, a known driver of AD, can activate the plasma contact system, which can lead to blood clot
formation and inflammation via generation of bradykinin upon cleavage of high molecular weight
kininogen (HK). There are three main lines of evidence that the contact system is involved in AD
pathology: 1) Aβ activates factor XII (F12), which initiates the contact system; 2) AD patient plasma
has increased contact system activation compared to that of age-matched, non-demented individuals;
and 3) Knockdown of the contact system using an anti-F12 antisense oligonucleotide ameliorates AD
pathology in a mouse model. HK circulates in blood as a complex with other coagulation factors, and
it serves as a non-enzymatic co-factor for the activation of these proteins. Compared to other
components of the contact system, depletion of HK offers more robust protection from blood clotting
and inflammation due to its central role in both pathways.
We have generated antibodies that are specific for cleaved HK that could help identify AD patients
with contact system involvement. We also have developed antibodies that block HK cleavage, which
might be beneficial to patients as they might ameliorate some of the pathologies of AD. It is important
to note that people who lack a contact system are not prone to bleeding, and therefore, blocking this
system in AD patients would not risk intracerebral hemorrhage.
Despite decades of research, there are no effective treatments that slow or prevent AD. Progress in
treating AD requires a multidisciplinary approach. We hypothesize that blocking the contact system
could reduce vascular and inflammatory pathologies in AD patients. We propose to further develop
our anti-HK antibodies for AD patient diagnostic and therapeutic use."

The Center for Pre-Clinical Cancer Research (Cancer COBRE) aims to identify clinically
relevant mechanisms of human cancer disease using models that closely reflect the disease
state in the context of the tumor microenvironment. Recent advances in 3D tumor culture
techniques have intensified the focus on in vitro human cell culture systems to reveal
insights into human tumorigenesis and thus drive novel therapeutic discovery.
Promising Junior Investigators (PJIs) address devastating human cancer diseases
that exhibit poor outcomes in patients and for which there are unmet therapeutic
needs. The four PJI projects feature osteosarcoma, breast cancer, liver cancer, and
prostate cancer as diseases that would benefit from pre-clinical models that are more
predictive of mechanistic efficacy in humans. All of the PJI projects will use specialized in
vivo mouse models and/or in vitro 3D tumor spheroids to identify relevant mechanisms
of tumorigenesis or for evaluation of novel therapeutic strategies. The Center will promote
a unified and coordinated approach by establishing a new specialized core facility, Pre-
Clinical Evaluation Core (PCEC), to provide scientific expertise and technical support for the
pre-clinical evaluation of the PJI projects. The unique PCEC will provide a centralized
approach that will support exploratory and translational assessment of cancer disease
mechanisms and therapeutic strategies in humans. To accomplish this approach, advanced
3D cell culture systems will provide critical translational information. and bridge the gap
between animal models and human therapeutic outcomes. The new Molecular Biology and
Immunopatholgy Core (MBIPC) will provide access to state-of-the-art equipment and
expertise in Molecular Biology and Immunopathology while leveraging extensive resources at
LSU SVM. Human and animal diseases are a major focus at the LSU SVM and on the LSU
campus. The Center has three Aims: Aim 1. To create a Center for Pre-Clinical Cancer
Research to promote and support centralized management and coordination of
pre-clinical evaluation of tumorigenesis mechanisms and translational therapeutic
approaches. Aim 2. To provide the COBRE PJIs and other investigators with a core
infrastructure for resources and support for advanced pre-clinical cancer disease
research that will enhance PJI individual competitiveness for extramural funding. Aim
3. To provide training and mentorship on pre-clinical evaluation using state-of-the-art in
vitro 3D tumor spheroids to complement in vivo cance disease modeling."
10974235,"Project Summary
In recent years, there has been a deluge of data from genome-wide functional assays. Rapid expansion of
computational techniques for mapping genetic correlates of intermediate molecular traits, such as gene
expression, has offered opportunities to explore molecular mechanisms that underlie disease susceptibility. Here
we will develop mechanistically justified statistical methods that enable allele-specific assessment of regulatory
activity in individual genomes. We hypothesize that incorporating the dosage modifying effect of regulatory
alleles into genetic association analyses will enhance the resolution of the current genotype-phenotype maps,
and allow for a more refined mapping of the underlying biological mechanisms.
Our proposal is organized into the following aims:
Aim1: To derive biologically interpretable effect sizes for regulatory variants and to enable allele-specific
prediction of gene and isoform dosage, we will develop haplotype-aware models of genetic regulatory
variation and apply them to large-scale reference transcriptome datasets.
Aim2: To enhance the resolution of the current genotype-phenotype maps, we will develop genetic association
methods that incorporate expected allele dosages for genes and transcript isoforms and apply them to
large biobank and GWAS data.
Aim3: To improve generalizability of genetic association signals to understudied populations, we will develop
genetic association methods that incorporate population-specific regulatory architecture of genes and
transcript isoforms."

PAR-20-105 Project of Radiological Discipline
Abstract/Summary
Establishing a radiological baseline for the dairy products of Wisconsin
The Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene (WSLH) is Wisconsin’s public and environmental
health laboratory. As part of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the WSLH is committed to
exploring new ideas and developing new programs to benefit the state and nation. The
WSLH’s Radiochemistry unit has been a member of the Food and Drug Administration’s Food
Emergency Response Network (FERN) for over twelve years. This agreement has enabled the
WSLH radiochemistry department to maintain and enhance its testing capability and capacity
for rapid and accurate response in the event of radiological food emergencies. The department
has experience in gamma and alpha spectrometry, gas proportional counting, and liquid
scintillation counting. The Radiochemistry unit uses only approved Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) and FDA FERN Cooperative Agreement Program methodologies. The unit is
certified and inspected by the EPA, a complete quality assurance and quality control program is
maintained. This laboratory is not a regulatory laboratory for human or animal food, nor does it
perform animal diagnostic laboratory services.
According to the Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection, Wisconsin
produced over 30 billion pounds of milk last year and is the country’s largest producer of dairy
products. With the cessation of the EPA RadNet milk sampling program in November 2014,
WSLH’s Radiochemistry unit is seeking to fill this deficit in the nation’s food monitoring by
testing Wisconsin’s raw milk to further the FDA’s efforts to prevent foodborne exposures to
contaminants from a radiological event. The program will focus on analysis of raw
unpasteurized milk samples from the state’s dairy plants for gamma emitting isotopes,
including 137Cs and 131I. All results obtained for this project would be reported to the nationally
integrated science system FERN. Future goals include increasing the number of dairy plants
beyond the initial scope of this project and expanding to incorporate alpha and beta emitters,
such as americium, plutonium, and 90Sr."

The ability to control bacterial infections with antibiotics has been one of the most important public health
advancements in human history. Before the discovery of antibiotics and vaccines, infectious disease was the
leading cause of death and constituted nearly 50% of deaths in the US alone. Now, infectious diseases as a
cause of death barely makes the top ten and we now treat most bacterial infections as a nuisance rather than
life-threatening diseases. Unfortunately, this is rapidly changing with the emergence of antibiotic resistant
bacterial pathogens. Ultimately, our ability to develop new antibiotics faster than resistance amongst
pathogens emerges has failed and many scientists expect we will experience a return to a pre-antibiotic era in
which we cannot treat what are now easy to cure bacterial infections. Therefore, novel, non-antibiotic
approaches to controlling bacterial infections are required and need to be explored. The main theme of the
BCM-CARBIRU is to use microbiome-based approaches to control bacterial infections at mucosal surfaces.
We will investigate ecological principles of microbial community inhibition of pathogen colonization as well as
the use of bacteriophage for precision elimination of bacterial pathogens. Both approaches have advantages
over the use of antibiotics in that they leave the native microbiome largely intact, avoiding the elimination of
beneficial microbes along with the pathogens targeted by antimicrobials. We propose three projects,
supported by two scientific cores and the administrative core, to explore and optimize microbiome-based
strategies for the prevention and treatment of bacterial infections. Project 1. Discovery and mechanistic
understanding of phage activity and synergism at host mucosal surfaces. Project 2. Defined microbial
communities to prevent and eradicate infection by antibiotic resistant pathogens. Project 3. Nasal microbial
consortia combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria. We expect two main outcomes from the execution of these
projects. First, we expect to define and understand the ecological principles that are key for microbial
communities and bacteriophage to function to control pathogens at mucosal surfaces. Second, we expect to
have identified actionable phage and microbial communities that will be available for testing in human clinical
trials at the end of the project periods. Together, these projects will capitalize on protective measures at the
mucosal surface, which have existed for millennia prior to modern medicine, as we enter the next era of
microbiome-based therapies."
10897730,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is rising in incidence but remains deadly for most patients. Some
progress has occurred in activating immune responses against PDA, however there are unanswered questions
that need to be addressed for immunotherapy to have a significant impact on the lives of PDA patients. Our
Team will address two critical problems: 1) inefficient generation of high quality T cells targeted against
PDA antigens capable of tumor trafficking and killing; and 2) multiple cellular barriers that comprise stromal
and myeloid cells that inhibit effector T cell trafficking and function in the PDA tumor microenvironment (TME).
Both clinical studies (“science in patients”) and pre-clinical studies (mouse models) will be conducted to address
these issues, and to evaluate novel combinatorial therapies that successfully modulate PDA stroma and chronic
inflammation to facilitate improved tumor infiltration of high quality and durable cancer targeted T cells. This
program is composed of 4 Projects and 4 Cores. The four projects will address the common overarching theme
that PDA is composed of multiple cell types and signals that inhibit T cell induction, trafficking into, and function
in tumors. Each project will address either the induction of quality T cells or the modulation of suppressive cell
populations as major barriers to T cell infiltration and activation, and all will integrate agents that bypass these
suppressive mechanisms with optimal T cell therapies. Projects 1, 2, and 4 will combine ongoing preclinical
studies aimed at uncovering mechanisms of suppression of different barriers with translational clinical trials that
study combination therapy to bypass these suppressive mechanisms. Project 3 will conduct a biomarker heavy
clinical trial using a multi-arm Platform design that will add and delete immune modulatory arms based on data
from biomarker analysis in this Project and from data that feeds into this Project from the other 3 Projects.
Standard procedures will be used across Projects to collect and bank serial biospecimens obtained from patients
treated on the clinical trials. The Cores will be critical for conducting the proposed assays and for analysis and
integration of the data. A Program database will be developed to allow for integration of data generated from
these assays across the entire Program. This will be a unique database that will also bring in data from other
sources such as the TCGA database, and will provide the Program Team with the ability to compare results
based on the genetics and inflammatory composition of each patient’s tumor and their response to the therapy
they received. The final outcomes will include results from a number of therapeutic interventions, approaches to
optimize each therapeutic, the potential to further integrate therapies that were tested in one or more projects in
future trials, and the ability to develop TME signatures that may further stratify patients for therapeutic
interventions. This program will substantially accelerate progress in PDA therapy, and allow otherwise nearly
impossible achievements in defining predictors of successful immunological therapeutic intervention for PDAs."

One of the most harmful side effects of chemotherapy is chemotherapy-induced peripheral
neuropathy (CIPN), a common, painful, and disabling side effect of many chemotherapy agents
for which there is no effective treatment. Our pilot phase IIB three-arm trial showed that
acupuncture treatment is associated with reduced CIPN pain and improved tactile threshold
compared to placebo and usual care control. We aim to increase cancer patients' function and
quality of life by identifying effective treatments to alleviate chemotherapy-related toxicities. The
goal of the proposed project is to determine the efficacy of acupuncture in treating CIPN pain
and improving function, as well as to improve sensory nerve recovery in cancer survivors
suffering from moderate to severe CIPN pain. We will conduct a phase III, 250-patient,
randomized, placebo (sham acupuncture)-controlled trial to: 1) determine the efficacy of an
eight-week EA treatment on CIPN symptoms among cancer survivors with moderate to severe
CIPN pain; 2) evaluate the effect of EA vs. SA on small sensory fiber function; and 3) evaluate
whether baseline QST outcomes predict response to EA."
10891758,"Responding to PAR 18-497: Sleep disorders and circadian clock disruption in Alzheimer’s disease and
other dementias of aging, the overall goal of this study is to elucidate the brain molecular mechanisms
underlying the bi-directional links between AD and sleep disruption in older adults. Sleep disruption
predisposes to AD, while AD results in substantial sleep disruption. However, the brain molecular mechanisms
underlying these bi-directional relationships remain obscure. Studies relating sleep disruption to the human
transcriptome have generally involved adults without AD, examined blood rather than brain, and cannot
distinguish sleep effects on AD from AD effects on sleep. We propose an innovative, cross-species
translational approach to overcome these gaps. We will integrate transcriptome and proteome profiles from
well-characterized human brains to identify promising gene associations with sleep fragmentation, AD
pathology, and cognitive impairment, with validation of causal genes through which sleep fragmentation leads
to AD pathology and cognitive impairment, and vice versa, based on genetic manipulation in Drosophila. In
compelling pilot studies, we showed that sleep fragmentation in older humans is associated with a greater risk
of incident AD. We have also defined a preliminary set of human genes that are significantly differentially
expressed in prefrontal cortex in association with sleep fragmentation and both AD pathology and cognitive
impairment. Moreover, from among these human candidate genes, we have successfully deployed
ethologically relevant Drosophila paradigms to validate conserved genetic modifiers of sleep fragmentation,
sleep-related cognitive plasticity, and both Tau and Aß neurotoxicity. This study will collect new human lateral
orbitofrontal cortex RNA sequencing data from 500 well-characterized older decedents from the Rush Memory
and Aging Project (R01AG17911), integrate this with available proteomic data, and relate this to actigraphic
sleep metrics, cognitive testing, and post-mortem indices of Aß and Tau pathology to identify candidate brain-
expressed genes underlying the bi-directional links between sleep fragmentation, AD pathology and cognition.
To move beyond descriptive associations, we will use Drosophila genetics to validate causal roles for these
genes in A/Tau-induced neurodegeneration, cognitive plasticity, and sleep. Finally, leveraging available
genomic data, we will confirm these causal relationships, observed in Drosophila, in humans using Mendelian
randomization. Leveraging broad expertise, and augmenting human brain transcriptomics and proteomics with
causal validation in Drosophila, this study will provide an in-depth description of the key bi-directional molecular
mechanisms linking sleep fragmentation, AD pathology, and cognitive impairment. These genes will represent
novel targets for further drug development to prevent the deleterious impact of sleep fragmentation on AD
pathology and cognition, and to treat sleep fragmentation in adults with AD, with the potential to have a
sustained impact on the health of millions of older Americans at risk for, or suffering from, AD."
11011741,"Project Summary/Abstract
Down syndrome (DS) is one of the most common forms of intellectual disability associated with trisomic repeat
of chromosome 21. Impaired cognition including dementia is a hallmark of DS, but the underlying
cellular/molecular mechanisms remain unclear, hampering our ability to develop effective therapy for cognitive
defects in people with DS. People with DS are at much higher risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a
devastating neurodegenerative disease and the most common of dementia in elderly. Starting at middle age,
majority of DS patients develop neuropathology and dementia syndromes resembling AD. Long-term memory
and synaptic plasticity require de novo protein synthesis, and recent studies indicate that mRNA translation
impairments contribute to cognitive syndromes in several neuronal diseases including AD, independent of brain
Amyloid beta pathology. Driven by previous studies and our preliminary data, the goal of this project is to
determine whether upregulation of the capacity for de novo protein synthesis, via suppression of eEF2K
and eEF2 phosphorylation, will improve multiple aging-related pathophysiology in DS including synaptic
failure and cognitive deficits. Three specific aims have been designed to test this hypothesis. Aim 1 seeks to
determine whether inhibition of eEF2K and eEF2 phosphorylation alleviates synaptic plasticity impairments in
mouse models of Down syndrome. Aim 2 is to determine whether suppression of eEF2K and eEF2
phosphorylation can improve DS-associated cognitive deficits. Aim 3 is to elucidate mechanisms underlying DS
pathophysiology associated with dysregulation of eEF2K/eEF2 signaling cascade. The project proposes in-depth
analyses using multiple approaches in neuroscience, including synaptic electrophysiology, pharmacology,
imaging, mouse genetics, and behavioral tests. We will employ novel genetic models and assays to assess de
novo protein synthesis in neurons including bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) with a
proximity ligation assay (PLA) (BONCAT-PLA). Combined with mass spectrometry/proteomics approach, we
expect to reveal identities of proteins in DS brains whose synthesis is dysregulated because of abnormal
eEF2K/eEF2 signaling. Findings from this project will contribute to our understanding of the cellular/molecular
signaling mechanisms underlying DS-associated cognitive impairments. Results from this project could inform
eventual development of novel therapeutic strategies for DS-related cognitive syndromes, for which no effective
treatments exist."

10758001,"Project Summary/Abstract. While activated microglia have been observed in the vicinity of neuritic amyloid
plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD), there have been no large-scale assessments of microglial activation in
aging and neurodegenerative disease. Our long-term goal is to understand the genetic underpinning of microglial
responses—particularly the proportion of microglia in a morphologically-defined state of activation—that increase
susceptibility to AD, so we can develop more targeted forms of immune-based therapies to prevent cognitive
decline and progression to dementia. Our objective is to refine the genetic architecture of microglial activation to
identify novel loci that influence the proportion of activated microglia, and to understand the functional
consequences of variants driving microglial activation in AD. Our central hypothesis is that identifiable gene
variants influence microglial activation and susceptibility to AD. We will test this hypothesis by conducting
genome-wide analysis and identifying associations between gene variants and microglial activation. Microglial
activation will be measured in human autopsy tissue (ex vivo), living human brain using PET imaging (in vivo),
and in monocyte-derived microglia-like cells (in situ and in vitro). Our rationale is that mapping the genetic
architecture that drives the proportion of activated microglia will be important in developing a first generation of
polygenic models for this trait and determine whether the proportion of activated microglia captures a causal
element of the cascade leading to AD. Our specific aims are 1) Validation and discovery of loci influencing a
postmortem measure of human microglial activation (proportion of activated microglia) in aging and Alzheimer's
disease, 2) In vivo validation of GWAS and assessment of clinical relevance using TSPO PET imaging to
measure microglial activation, and 3) In situ histological and in vitro functional characterization of validated
variants in a human microglia-like system. For the first aim, we will perform GWAS and measure the proportion
of activated microglia in autopsy brain tissue from 1,600 individuals, and then replicate our findings in an
independent, diverse set of samples from three separate institutions. In the second aim, we will perform GWAS
and TSPO PET imaging, using the state-of-the-art radioligand 11C-ER176, in a prospective cohort of 200 older
human subjects (equal proportions of cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease) to
identify gene variants associated with AD-related microglial activation. In the third aim, we will assess how gene
variants identified in Aims 1 and 2 influence cellular function and protein expression in monocyte-derived
microglia-like cells. Our innovative approach combines autopsy, PET, and human cell measures of microglial
activation to create a multimodal investigation into the genetic architecture of microglial responses. The proposed
research is significant, as mapping the variants that regulate microglial activation, and determining their
functional consequences, will provide key insights in prioritizing potential therapeutic targets for drug
development and in creating novel outcome measures with which to guide clinical trial design."

10861833,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Traumatic injuries from burns, blasts, or major surgery dysregulates immune system function predisposing the
injured people to life-threatening opportunistic infections or persistent critical illness. Targeted immunotherapies
for traumatic injuries to restore immune system function and homeostasis have not yet been developed and are
urgently needed. The immunophenotypic diversity in humans provides a solid justification to target evolutionarily
conserved innate immunoregulatory networks that are less heterogenous for treatment. As such, the
reprogramming of innate immune cells by a process called “trained immunity” is a promising concept for targeting
therapeutics to reduce the morbidity and mortality from trauma-induced complications. Trained immunity can
occur in short-lived innate immune cells by epigenetically modifying accessibility to immune regulatory genes in
hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), which are then passed on by differentiation to innate effector cells, leaving them
better poised to respond to infection. We have developed Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonists – unmethylated
CpG-DNA sequences, which are naturally found in bacterial DNA and eukaryotic cell mitochondria - as
immunotherapeutic medical countermeasures to promote immune system recovery after radiation and traumatic
injuries. We recently discovered that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), which are critical cellular residents in
the bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche, express high TLR9 levels, strongly react to CpG-DNA
stimulation, and mediate emergency granulopoiesis responses to infection in neutropenic mice. This discovery
prompted us to consider trained immunity as a central mechanism contributing to the immune protection from
systemic CpG-DNA treatment in our burn trauma and infection model. Here, we address the hypothesis that
TLR9 agonist therapy mediates protective immunity and restores immune homeostasis by trained immunity
mechanisms involving bone marrow MSCs and HSCs. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following specific
aims: 1) To delineate hematopoietic and peripheral immune consequences of trauma with CpG-DNA therapeutic
intervention, 2) To identify transcriptional and epigenetic changes in bone marrow MSCs and HSCs from injured
and uninjured mice treated with CpG-DNA, and 3) To generate and use chimeric mouse models to delineate
injury and CpG-DNA induced trained immunity phenotypes transferred by HSCs. We anticipate that the results
from this research program will provide pre-clinical mechanistic insights towards translating CpG-DNA as an
immunotherapeutic strategy for trauma-induced immune dysregulation."
10876499,"Project Summary / Abstract
Research in the Robb group is focused on expanding the frontiers of the emergent field of polymer
mechanochemistry, where mechanical force is harnessed to selectively activate productive
chemical transformations in stress-sensitive molecules known as mechanophores. Our expertise
is in the molecular design and development of new mechanophores and reaction strategies,
enabling access to stimuli-responsive polymers that address challenges in a variety of areas
including stress sensing and mechanically triggered molecular release. Our research advances
the fundamental understanding of mechanochemical reactivity through the development of
structure–activity relationships and novel molecular design principles, providing a foundation for
creating innovative materials. Nevertheless, critical gaps remain that have limited the translation
of polymer mechanochemistry to applications in biology and medicine. In this proposal, we outline
a multifaceted approach for the development of systems that enable acoustically controlled
molecular delivery from mechanochemically active polymers using biocompatible focused
ultrasound, specifically targeting biological applications that have thus far remained out of reach.
In the five-year period of this MIRA grant, we will build on a powerful mechanophore platform
developed in our group for the mechanically triggered release of diverse small molecule payloads
that leverages the mechanochemical activation of masked 2-furylcarbinol derivatives. While
ultrasonication is routinely used in the laboratory for the mechanochemical activation of polymers,
the strong acoustic cavitation of dissolved gases at these acoustic pressures is highly destructive
to tissues, making it incompatible for most biological applications. Complementing our
development of novel chemistries, we propose to develop unprecedented systems for achieving
remote control of mechanochemical reactions using focused ultrasound under physiological
conditions with spatial and temporal precision. The unique synergy provided by novel materials
design and biocompatible acoustic activation strategies will realize the translational potential of
polymer mechanochemistry and establish mechanophores for triggered release as an untapped
biomedical tool. Our research will target the delivery of a wide range of payloads useful for
theranostics to bioimaging that demonstrate the power of this approach and pave the way toward
diverse applications in biology, medicine, and human health."

10883869,"In this Yr16 renewal of our longitudinal study on the natural progression of AD biomarkers, the central goal
remains to further understand the occurrence of asymptomatic amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau deposition and the
progression to clinical cognitive impairment. This cohort has now matured to the point that there is now
sufficient longitudinal follow-up to address important hypotheses that were formulated from the beginning of
this study but could not be properly addressed until 10-15 years of follow-up were in place - as is the case now.
In this renewal period we aim to better characterize the different roles gray matter brain aging and small vessel
disease have on AD progression. Chronological age is the most salient risk factor for late-onset AD. However,
it remains unclear what components of the aging process account for this risk. In this proposal, we use gray
matter brain age models to study the atrophy-related components of aging and 7T vascular imaging to
characterize the SVD components of aging. Aim 1 uses this estimated gray matter brain age to explain
individual differences in AD biomarkers and cognitive decline. Aim 2 uses fMRI and cerebrovascular imaging
at 7T to examine the role of SVD in accelerating the amyloid-induced tauopathy and neurodegeneration. Aim
3 ties together brain aging and SVD to test components of a model that small vessel disease (SVD)
accelerates Tau deposition and neurodegeneration (including accelerated gray matter brain aging). Over the
last 2 years we have transitioned the MR imaging of this study to a 7T MR scanner to take advantage of its
high field strength for 1) characterizing small vessel morphology (e.g., early markers of cerebrovascular
disease) associated with AD risk and 2) characterizing functional neural systems (fMRI). Over the course of
this study we have shown that many (~25%) of cognitively unimpaired older adults have significant cerebral
amyloid deposition, subsequently defined as preclinical AD. We and others have shown that in this preclinical
stage, cross-sectional Ab burden is only weakly associated with objective cognitive performance. At this early
disease stage, Ab burden is more strongly associated with changes in the functional connectivity, which can be
measured by fMRI. We and others have identified that regional medial temporal lobe functional connectivity
(MTL_FC) during memory encoding is associated with increased Ab load. In recent preliminary work, we have
found that traditional markers of SVD interact with amyloid burden in their relationship to MTL_FC. Those with
high Ab and high White Matter Hyperintensity (WMH) burden have particularly high regional MTL_FC. In
individuals with Ab burden, SVD accelerates tau deposition, neurodegeneration, and progression of cognitive
and clinical decline. The current cohort of 70 active participants will be supplemented by recruitment of
additional older adults to achieve 200 baseline assessments. Individuals will undergo 3 MRI scans and 2 Ab-
and tau-PET scans over a 32-month interval."
10890706,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Overall
Antibiotic resistance is a major public health concern worldwide. This CARB (Combating Antibiotic Resistant
Bacteria) proposal was conceived in response to this urgent global threat. The theme of our program, “Exploiting
Membrane Targets to Overcome Antibiotic Resistance,” addresses important gaps in current knowledge to
facilitate translation of discoveries into strategies to combat antibiotic-resistant infections. A team of highly
collaborative and productive scientists from diverse fields – chemistry, biochemistry, structural biology, and
molecular genetics – has joined forces in this effort. The cell envelope, the interface between host and pathogen,
is a major point of vulnerability for bacteria. Interfering with cell envelope assembly or function can inhibit bacterial
growth, promote lysis, decrease resistance to host immune defenses, and increase susceptibility to other
antibiotics to overcome resistance. Identifying and exploiting new ways of disrupting envelope assembly
pathways to enable therapeutic discovery has been an important goal in the field. However, progress in this area
has been hampered by the many challenges posed by envelope targets. Biosynthetic and regulatory processes
that govern cell envelope biogenesis take place at a membrane interface and often involve proteins that contain
multiple membrane-spanning segments, function in multi-protein complexes, and use complicated substrates
that are not commercially available. Advancing our understanding of these cell envelope targets requires the
concerted efforts of an interdisciplinary team with expertise that spans broad areas of chemistry and biology.
Recent technological advances and biological discoveries, many made by the CARB project team, have
transformed our understanding of cell envelope biology and opened the door to fundamentally new approaches
to therapeutic targeting of this essential structure. To build on these successes, we have created a collaborative,
interdisciplinary project to identify, characterize, and validate novel vulnerabilities in envelope biogenesis and
maintenance pathways. The three proposed projects are not only connected by the shared focus of the
investigators on cell envelope biology, their commitment to molecular mechanism as the foundation of
translational research, and overlapping themes and goals, but also by synergistic collaboration among multiple
investigators within as well as between each proposal. Project 1 will define the structural basis for enzymatic
activity of the broadly conserved SEDS family cell wall polymerases and determine how SEDS proteins function
within large macromolecular complexes during growth and division. Project 2 will focus on identifying and
exploiting vulnerabilities in the Gram-positive cell envelope. Project 3 will focus on characterizing and exploiting
vulnerabilities in the Gram-negative cell envelope. A streamlined administrative core will coordinate activities to
maximize synergies, data sharing, and use of all program assets while providing responsible fiscal oversight."
10875734,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Current therapies do not alter the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a devastating neurodegenerative
illness that affects 5.8 million people in the United States and 44 million people worldwide. Thus, an urgent
goal for research is to identify points of control for neurodegeneration, which may be targeted to slow down
AD progression. In this application, we propose to test the hypothesis that the enzyme N-Acylethanolamine
Acid Amidase (NAAA) is one such focal point. NAAA is a lysosomal lipid hydrolase that converts
palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) into palmitate. PEA is an endogenous agonist of the neuroprotective nuclear
receptor PPAR-α, whereas palmitate promotes neurodegeneration by suppressing the transcription co-
activator PGC1α, a key regulator of neuronal energy metabolism and survival. Preliminary experiments have
shown that NAAA transcription is abnormally elevated in persons with sporadic AD and in various animal
models of neurodegeneration, including the 5xfAD model of AD. In the same models, we found that
pharmacological NAAA inhibition and/or genetic NAAA deletion exert marked protective effects. Based on
these results, we hypothesize that dysfunctions in NAAA-regulated lipid signaling may be critically
involved in the pathogenesis of AD. We have three specific aims. Aim 1. Characterize NAAA-regulated
lipid signaling in mouse models of AD. Using 5xfAD and Tau P301S mice, two mouse lines that capture
distinct aspects of AD pathology, we will identify age-dependent, regionally selective changes in NAAA-
regulated lipid signaling, which might precede and/or accompany neurodegenerative alterations and
cognitive impairment. Aim 2. Determine the impact of pharmacological NAAA inhibition in mouse models of
AD. We will assess the impact of chronic administration of the compounds ARN19702 and ARN16186 – two
brain-permeant NAAA inhibitors discovered by our team – on molecular, morphological and behavioral
markers of disease progression in 5xfAD and Tau P301S mice. Aim 3. Determine the impact of genetic
NAAA deletion in mouse models of AD. Using our conditional NAAA-/- mice, we will generate NAAA-
deficient 5xfAD and Tau P301S mice to evaluate the impact of NAAA deletion on disease progression. In
Aims 2 and 3, we will also explore molecular and cellular substrates for the effects of NAAA
inhibition/deletion using single-cell RNA sequencing. The proposed studies will elucidate the functional roles
of NAAA-regulated lipid signaling in the pathogenesis of AD and, if our hypothesis is verified, will validate
NAAA as a novel molecular target for the treatment of this disorder."

Our Program Project is a thematically, experimentally and operationally integrated multidisciplinary team
approach to address key components of genome organization that are functionally linked to modified epigenetic
control of gene expression in breast cancer. The thematic focus and working hypothesis of our Program is
that genomic organization and epigenetic control of gene expression coordinately facilitate
physiological regulation, including hormone responsiveness, of normal and cancer cell growth,
proliferation and cell identity. Our highly collaborative research team established paradigm-shifting insights
into parameters of nuclear organization that include: 1. Mitotic gene bookmarking by phenotypic transcription
factors to control fidelity of gene expression as cells divide; 2. Relationships between fidelity of nuclear
organization, transcription factor localization and metastasis of breast cancer to bone; 3. Dynamic modifications
of higher-order inter- and intra-chromosomal interactions in breast cancer cells; 4. Coordinate control of cell
growth and phenotype by tissue-specific transcription factors; 5. Epitranscriptomic profiling of endocrine therapy
resistant and advanced breast cancer cells in response to selective estrogen receptor modulators; and 6.
Noncoding RNA-mediated regulation of the aggressive breast cancer phenotype.
This application captures the scientific progress, synergy and momentum of our research team and leverages
powerful new technologies for editing the genome, visualizing cells at super resolution and in real time, and
decoding higher-order genome organization. We will use normal mammary epithelial, subtype-specific and
endocrine resistant breast cancer cell models for discovery, then validate key findings and examine potential
clinical relevance using animal models, public databases and patient tumor specimens and organoids.
Emphasis will be on exploring molecular mechanisms that integrate multiple dimensions of epigenetic control
with modified genome organization in breast cancer. Each of the three projects focuses on a unique aspect of
epigenetic control that is required for fidelity of gene expression and is compromised in breast cancer, including:
the pivotal role of mitotic gene bookmarking in stabilizing the normal mammary epithelial phenotype (Project 1);
novel functions of bromodomain chromatin readers in endocrine therapy resistance (Project 2); and contributions
of the novel long noncoding RNA MANCR to deregulated genome organization in aggressive breast cancer
(Project 3). A shared resource core will support integrated bioinformatics and biostatistics analyses; standardized
experimental design; cell, organoid and in vivo models; and resource authentication to ensure scientific rigor and
reproducibility. An administrative core will maximize scientific and programmatic integration, prioritization and
oversight. The impact of this program will be the integration of multiple levels of genome organization
and of epigenetic control to understand how gene regulation is disrupted in breast cancer."

11034208,"Project Summary
Aging is the greatest known risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia in
older individuals. However, effective AD therapies remain elusive, which underscores the need to better
understand disease etiology and its co-occurrence with advanced age. The apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) allele is
the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD and it is associated with decreased lifespan. The APOE
protein is crucial to lipid homeostasis through its regulation of the metabolism of various lipids in blood and the
brain. Sulfatide (ST) is a key component of myelin and is metabolized through APOE transport. Previous
studies from our lab and others revealed a strong association between ST deficiency, a specific metabolic
abnormality, and astrogliosis, a pathologic reaction related to neuroinflammation. For example, ST deficiency
and astrogliosis both are induced by aging, in APOE4 carriers, and under AD conditions. Our preliminary
studies using ST deficiency mice showed (1) marked astrogliosis within myelin regions; (2) astrogliosis
independent of microgliosis; (3) marked upregulation of phosphorylated (activated) STAT3 and (4) a significant
upregulation of astrocytic oncostatin M receptor (OSMR), which is known to interact with ST. Finally, multiple
studies have consistently demonstrated that ST recruits and directly interacts with laminin, an extracellular
matrix (ECM) protein. Our novel findings led us to hypothesize that ST loss is directly sensed by astrocytic
processes through a mechanism that involves a disruption of ST-ECM-integrin/OSMR interactions that lead to
STAT3 activation. To test this central hypothesis, we propose three Specific Aims: 1) To examine the effects
of brain ST deficiency on astrocyte reactivity, neuroinflammation, and cognitive function using a novel inducible
mouse model of conditional ST deficiency; 2) To unravel the molecular mechanism(s) underlying ST
deficiency-induced astrogliosis; and 3) To determine if restoring brain ST content ameliorates astrogliosis,
neuroinflammation, and cognitive impairment in the context of AD and aging. To the best of our knowledge, the
proposed research (in response to PAR-17-031, “Role of Age-Associated Metabolic Changes in
Alzheimer's Disease”) is the first to study the potential role of ST deficiency in astrogliosis and
neuroinflammation, and to examine the molecular mechanism by which ST deficiency promotes
neurodegeneration in AD. If our hypothesis is borne out, this work also will provide proof-of-concept to support
the development of novel ST-based therapeutic strategies seeking to treat AD and other ST deficiency-
associated pathologic conditions."
10931094,"A major goal of the Biomedical Data Translator Program is to facilitate disease classification
based on molecular and cellular abnormalities. While many experimental approaches exist to
interrogate molecular or cellular processes, few can discern which among a host of potential
abnormalities are relevant to disease in the human system. Genetic variants associated with
disease are unique in providing molecular alterations causally related to human disease risk.
There are two types of genetic associations. Rare disease associations can (usually) be
clearly linked to a gene and are well represented by catalogs such as ClinVar, OMIM, and
Monarch. Complex disease associations are harder to interpret because they (a) are statistical
rather than qualitative and (b) usually lie in noncoding genomic regions that cannot be
immediately translated to molecular or cellular abnormalities. Many complementary resources to
help in the biological translation of complex disease associations have recently emerged,
broadly classifiable as either “functional genomic” datasets (e.g. from epigenomic profiling or
chromatin capture) or predictive bioinformatic methods (e.g. that integrate various genetic and
functional genomic datasets to predict disease-susceptibility genes or pathways). These
resources require expertise to curate and interpret, and there is as yet no knowledge source
that integrates them to interpret complex disease associations. Furthermore, techniques for
harmonizing heterogeneous functional genomic datasets with respect to one another are not yet
established, most predictive bioinformatic methods specify complex data-processing pipelines
that have not yet been scaled to run across many diseases, and there are few if any “gold
standards” to evaluate the molecular or cellular abnormalities identified by these resources.
The goal of our proposed project is to address these gaps within a complex
disease genetics Knowledge Provider for Translator. We are experts in complex disease
genetics and maintain the Knowledge Portal Network (KPN), a collection of open source web
portals and Smart APIs that make integrated genetic and genomic datasets publicly accessible
for >180 complex diseases. We have built the KPN by developing a protocol for working with
disease experts to aggregate and curate high-confidence genetic datasets, building
computational pipelines to harmonize these data and apply predictive bioinformatic methods
upon them, and extracting relationships mined from these data into a Neo4J graph database.
We propose to use the KPN as a foundation to implement a Translator Knowledge Provider of
high-confidence complex disease associations and predicted disease-relevant molecular and
cellular abnormalities. We will implement this Knowledge Provider by (a) expanding the data
sources, data types, and bioinformatic methods integrated within the KPN; (b) developing new
computational algorithms to improve the ability of genetic data to identify molecular and cellular
abnormalities underlying complex disease; (c) maintaining REST services provisioning
Translator with these resources; and (d) developing methodologies for evaluating the accuracy
and internal consistency of these data, further curating them, and defining use cases of them
within Translator. In so doing, we will enable Translator users to address questions such as:
• What genes are causally linked to complex disease [X], and with what confidence?
• What is the increase in risk for complex disease [X] when gene [Y] is perturbed?
• What pathways are enriched for associations with complex disease [X]?
• What tissues mediate the pathogenesis of complex disease [X]?
• What other diseases are genetically correlated with complex disease [X]?
We participated in the Translator feasibility study and contributed important insights to the
project vision including (a) a unifying architectural model of Translator (based on interviews with
each Translator team) closely followed by OTA-19-009; (b) the concept of Translator as a tool to
augment (rather than replace) human reasoning; and (c) the idea of a “Turing test” to evaluate
Translator capabilities. Our expertise in human genetics and hypothesis-driven science, but also
computer science and computational biology, ideally positions us to collaborate with NIH staff
and other awardees to help guide Translator data integration in a scientifically rigorous manner."
10999772,"Chemical biology and systems biology operate at different scales of molecular or cellular
organization, requiring translation between the disciplines (e.g., terminology, existing evidence,
new findings) to allow each to inform the other (1, 2). We propose a Biomedical Data Translator
Knowledge Provider for Systems Chemical Biology to address this need.
Centrally, the promise of systems chemical biology (SCB) is discovering novel therapeutics
and re-purposing opportunities, avoiding toxicity and other side effects, and understanding
how small molecules function (i.e., mechanism-of-action studies). Many evidence types used
to solve such problems can also be used to understand functions of alterations at similar
molecular scales, such as post-translational modification and protein-coding genetic variants.
Currently, researchers in the field face major data access and interpretation challenges. For
example, to support mechanism-of-action (MoA) studies, many experimental methods produce
relevant data (gene-expression, protein-protein interactions, diverse bioactivities against pure
proteins and cells, etc.) that are too numerous and heterogeneous to query for most researchers.
Many web-based tools exist to share such data, but they are scattered, not always easy to find,
and generally lack any communication between each other. As the field matures and increasingly
embraces high-throughput experiments, these problems will only get worse (3).
Our proposed SCB Knowledge Provider will mitigate these challenges by:
• integrating and reconciling core molecular data (structure, name, annotated target) from
multiple existing resources;
• integrating and analyzing biological activity data for small molecules across multiple
biological scales (binding, cellular activity, disease indication) (4); and
• providing context for activities of small molecules and their targets informed by systems
biology (complexes, pathways, processes).
Our proposed SCB Knowledge Provider will enable answering questions such as:
• what is the mechanism of action of a small molecule identified from a phenotypic screen?
• which compounds are available to modulate my target of interest, and which other
candidate targets might influence the activity of my target in a particular cellular context?
• given my interest in a disease process or pathway, which candidate targets should I
consider in relevant models, and which compounds are known to modulate those targets?
We anticipate addressing gaps in data by scouting for inclusion additional sources of small-molecule
bioactivity and contextual information about protein target function (see Data
Milestones). We will implement existing and develop new methods to surface inconsistencies
and prioritize returned results (see Methods Milestones). Finally, we propose an Advisory
Committee to help prioritize content most relevant to researchers, overcome development
obstacles, and keep abreast of emerging data and methods (see Outreach Milestones).
We have core expertise needed to realize this SCB vision via 15+ years of experience with
small-molecule bioactivity databases and portals (5-7), plus expertise in phenotypic screening,
small-molecule profiling, and MoA studies (8-10), which demand integrated understanding of
diverse data for hypothesis-driven science. We also made key contributions to Translator
feasibility, including a workflow-centric view of data exploration by subject-matter experts,
identifying and providing key datasets and methods for production of TIDBITS, and prototyping
set-based (e.g., gene-list) analyses in workflows. These experiences ideally position us to
realize a Systems Chemical Biology Knowledge Provider for Translator."
10931125,"1) Component: Autonomous Relay Agent.
We will develop an ARA named EVIDARA to
evaluate returns from queries in knowledge
sources (KS) using a new epistemology: The
“reasoning” is based on checking against empirical
evidence available in raw data (measurements)
instead of deductive reasoning
(FIG.►). EVIDARA will assist the Autonomous
Relay System (ARS) to identify paths in returned
knowledge graphs (KG) that may
conflict with real-word evidence and to relay queries to appropriate specialty KS or database.
(2) Problem addressed: EHR and multi-omics raw data from large cohorts, if properly preprocessed
[e.g., by Knowledge Providers, such as the DOCKET, see application by Dr. Glusman],
offers a new opportunity for ad hoc systematic extraction of empirical knowledge on relationships
(“Protein P level correlates with risk for disease D”) instead of relying on specific epidemiological
analyses. The problem in harnessing raw data for empirical support in lieu of deductive reasoning
is that the KGs to be evaluated are extracted from knowledge sources of distinct types and that
the relevance of paths depends on the query context Q. Also the ARA algorithm should be scalable
to digest the emerging multi-omics data from projects like All-of-Us, the UK Biobank.
(3) Plan for implementation: Research will be conducted to evaluate a new epistemic realm:
make empirical evidence central to “reasoning”. We have assembled a set of functioning tools to
overcome the chicken-egg problem of getting a project started and jumpstart development and
testing of EVIDARA: (i) SPOKE, one of the largest biomedical knowledge network (KN) has integrated
25 diverse of KS into a single (neo4j) network database of 2 million nodes and will serve
as testing ground for research well before we can use KGs produced by the Knowledge Providers.
(ii) Algorithms that use raw data from EHR and multi-omics studies to evaluate the returned KGs.
For instance, we compute weights of all nodes in the entire KN through a random-walk algorithm
biased by their role for a given condition Q observed in the raw data. (iii) Raw data beyond EHR:
multi-omics profiles from a study at ISB with >10k variables which vastly exceeds coverage of
observable nodes in KNs offered by EHRs. Example query: “Vitamin K stimulates stem-cell signaling,
thus could promote cancer. What is the molecular pathway? Mechanisms returned as KG
will be pruned by EVIDARA and checked against correlative evidence in the raw data: Is there
evidence that taking Vit. K or its antagonist reduces cancer risk?”. Importantly, since EVIDARA
learns on a network of many types of KS, it will provide information to the ARS about which type
of KS/Knowledge Provider to invoke next (in iterative queries) to improve the knowledge graph.
(4) Expertise & resources: The MPIs, Drs. S. Baranzini (UCSF) and S. Huang (ISB) are researchers
with long history of working with medical big data, thus offering technical expertise and the
critical SME perspective. SB’s team has created and maintains SPOKE. The uniquely self-contained
SPOKE network will allow NCATS staff to test other ARAs. SH brings decades of experience
in research of disease mechanisms and medical epistemology. His team will provide multi-omics
datasets and data analytics expertise. With his prior work in the NCATS Translator program, he is
well poised to maximize team science efficiency and help convert its vision into tangible results.
(5) Potential challenges. (i) Quality of evidential support depends on quality of raw data. A quality
control is beyond the scope of EVIDARA but could be provided by Knowledge Providers focusing
on new multi-omics data sets (e.g. DOCKET). (ii) Testing EVIDARA on other KS from Knowledge
Providers) may be slowed down by interoperability issues (e.g. incompatible identifiers). Such
issues will be addressed early in Year 1 with help of the Standard and Reference group."
10795706,"Abstract
 The tau protein is a key hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease and other tauopathies but its pathogenesis is
not well understood. Targeting its toxicity and/or aggregates with antibodies is the leading therapeutic
approach to slow the progression of these diseases. Here, we propose to clarify selective cellular vulnerability
to tau pathology, and to develop single domain antibodies (sdAbs) to enhance pathogenic tau clearance. To
realize these goals, three Specific Aims will be pursued: 1) To clarify cell-type specific vulnerability in
Drosophila melanogaster tauopathy models. 2) To clarify in the fly tauopathy models the mechanisms of sdAb-
mediated clearance of tau pathology, associated prevention of neurotoxicity, and tau-induced death. 3)
Confirmation of key findings from Aims 1-2 in tauopathy mouse models and in human tauopathy neurons
derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).
 We and others have shown GABAergic cell death and deficits in models and human tauopathy brains.
Additionally, glutamatergic neurons have been reported to selectively accumulate tau aggregates. Both
pathways are detrimental but possibly on a different timescale, and elucidation of the mechanisms involved
may help develop tau therapies. We will determine in Drosophila tau models if GABAergic vs. glutamatergic
neurons are more vulnerable to cell death vs. tau aggregation induced by tau expression in these cell subtypes
individually, compared to global neuronal tau expression. We will then examine by genetic tools the roles of
autophagy, lysosome or proteasome activity in tau sequestration or degradation. Additionally, astrocytic tau
pathology occurs in all tauopathies, but its influence on functional impairments has not been well studied.
 We previously reported that an antibody fragment that targets tau suppresses tau-associated lethality
and other phenotypes in Drosophila. For potentially more efficacious therapies, we developed anti-tau single
domain antibody fragments (sdAbs) that are smaller, and should fold better for gene therapy, than conventional
antibody fragments. Our preliminary data confirm their efficacy in a Drosophila tau model. We will determine
whether secreted sdAbs still maintain anti-tau function, if their efficacy is cell-type related or requires CNS
expression, and via which pathway these sdAbs promote tau clearance.
 Subsequently, we will seek to confirm the fly data in transgenic tauopathy mice and in iPSC-derived
human tauopathy neurons. First, we will examine the temporal relationship between neurotoxicity, neuronal
death and tau aggregation in GABAergic vs. glutamatergic neurons in the mice. Then, they will receive AAV
gene therapy of the most efficacious sdAbs from the fly studies, followed by behavioral and brain analyses. An
analogous approach will be conducted in the human neurons that have been differentiated into GABAergic and
glutamatergic neurons. Together, these aims will provide valuable insights into cell-type specific vulnerability in
tauopathies, and how tau pathology may be best targeted in future gene therapy trials."

syndrome who would be expected to have underlying TDP-43 or 4R tau pathology, but not PHF tau. This
observation has not been addressed, mainly due to the lack of autopsy cohorts, which is necessary to address
this issue. We have been accumulating autopsied cases over the past four years and were able to assess the
relationship between flortaucipir PET uptake and histopathology in an autopsy cohort of 26 patients (25 with
Alzheimer’s disease and 1 with FTLD). Using a validated meta-ROI (region of interest) cut-point that we
developed to determine whether PHF tau is present or absent in Alzheimer’s disease, we found flortaucipir
PET to have great sensitivity and specificity to PHF tau, and to the Braak neurofibrillary tangle staging scheme.
Interestingly, however, the single FTLD patient in that autopsy cohort with 4R tau deposition was classified as
positive, suggesting that flortaucipir PET may indeed be detecting 4R tau. To date, there are no other autopsy
studies, and no FTLD autopsy cohort has been described. Hence, there remain important knowledge gaps in
the field. We still do not know whether flortaucipir uptake is indeed reflecting underlying 4R tau, what
flortaucipir uptake is reflecting in FTLD TDP-43 where there is no tau, and how our meta-ROI cut-point would
perform in an FTLD cohort. We have now amassed a large autopsy cohort of 80 cases with antemortem
flortaucipir PET (FTLD with TDP-43 or 4R tau, n = 42 and Alzheimer’s disease, n=38). In this R01, we will
study the relationship between antemortem flortaucipir uptake and pathological protein immunohistochemistry.
Specifically, we will evaluate the association of flortaucipir PET with pathological diagnoses, association
between flortaucipir PET uptake and the Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage in an FTLD cohort, and assess for
associations between regional quantitative flortaucipir uptake and quantitative protein immunohistochemistry,
across all 80 cases, to determine whether flortaucipir uptake is influenced by non-PHF tau targets, such as β-
amyloid, 4R tau, TDP-43, microglia and astroglia, and whether uptake is influenced by the presence of multiple
non-PHF tau protein deposition. This multi-PI proposal is led by two expert PIs with almost 40 years of
combined research experience in FTLD neuroimaging, including with flortaucipir PET (Professor Whitwell), and
in degenerative neuropathology (Professor Josephs). If the aims of the grant were achieved the field would not
only have a better understanding of flortaucipir PET behavior, but better understanding of tau ligand behavior
in general, which would aid with second and third generation tau ligand development. Development of sensitive
and specific future tau PET ligands is important for biomarker utility in clinical trials."

10836372,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Infertility affects up to 13% of reproductive age couples across the globe but the underlying mechanistic basis of
infertility and the role of infertility as an overall marker of general health is unclear. These knowledge gaps hinder
the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of infertility leading to physical, psychological and financial burden to
couples with infertility. To address these challenges, The Massachusetts General Hospital Harvard Center for
Reproductive Medicine has assembled an integrative team of investigators with expertise in reproductive
medicine, genomics, population genetics and genetic literacy who will conduct clinical translational investigation
in humans with infertility: Aim 1: To elucidate the genetic and phenomic architecture of infertility through the lens
of specific rare diseases and common traits; Aim 2: To catalyze a collaborative think-tank focused on reducing
the suffering and costs of infertility, in a manner that is outward looking, forward thinking and integrates global
perspectives; Aim 3: To nucleate a vibrant hub for outreach, training and community engagement that brings the
scientific team closer to the patients they serve, the trainees they want to mentor, and the larger community of
scientists and clinicians who are invested in reducing the burdens caused by infertility. These aims will be
achieved using two Clinical Research projects which will be supported by a Genomics and Functional Core,
Outreach Core and Administrative Core. Project 1 will perform next-generation sequencing and targeted
genotype-driven phenotyping studies in clinical cohorts enriched for genetically driven infertility from admixed
and consanguineous populations characterized by both hypogonadotropic and hypergonadotropic
hypogonadism in both sexes. Project 2 will bring together >1,800,000 multi-ethnic population biobank samples
to perform genome-wide association studies, phenome-wide association studies, and Mendelian randomization
studies to implicate key biologic pathways determining fertility and synthesize the genetic results across infertility
and related traits to characterize the effects of the identified genes and pathways on reproductive health and
overall morbidity. The Genomics and Functional Core will provide genomic technologies, data analytics,
computational and statistical support, and will generate genetically engineered human induced pluripotent cells
for validation of Project 1 & 2 genetic discoveries. The Outreach Core will buoy Project 1 & 2 activities by
engaging key stakeholders through patient group meetings, creating clinician-facing materials to enable
communication of genetic results and launch a website inspired by design-thinking for broad dissemination to
patients, families and clinicians. The Administrative Core will advance the Center’s scientific goals by providing
timely support to foster engagement and communication between investigators, patients, research trainees and
the broader academic community. Through these interdigitating activities, the Center will train the next
generation of reproductive biologists and the results emanating from its activities will help inform clinical care
and alleviate the suffering of patients with infertility."
10458468,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
This proposed Phase II SBIR project will finalize our Virtual Support System (VSS), a mobile health (mHealth),
video-based system that provides support to young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) across the
entire HIV care continuum. There are currently 1.2 million people living with HIV in the United States, and
among MSM nationally, Black MSM had the highest number of HIV diagnoses in 2018. Engagement in care is
often thought of as a continuum including 1) HIV diagnosis, 2) linkage to care, 3) retention in care, 4) HIV
antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation, and 5) viral suppression, and YBMSM experience severe disparities
across the HIV care continuum, compared to both older Black MSM and young White and Latino MSM.
Our VSS addresses multi-faceted challenges that lead to poor treatment initiation, adherence, and retention
outcomes among YBMSM. It takes a holistic approach, tailored specifically for YBMSM, to improve well-being
and reduce stigma through customizable video-based support, a community of peers, on-demand information,
and access to local resources within a simple-to-follow user interface. Moreover, VSS fills a critical gap, as
mHealth programs currently available to YBMSM living with HIV are few in number and typically narrow in
scope. VSS will be free of cost for YBMSM and marketed to HIV organizations nationwide.
Our Phase I findings demonstrated that VSS is highly acceptable, usable, and appealing to both YBMSM living
with HIV and their service providers. We hypothesize that VSS, created using human-centered design, will
improve HIV care continuum outcomes (as measured by viral suppression) and reduce stigma among YBMSM
ages 18-29 who are living with HIV. This new intervention will also enhance the ability of HIV service
organizations nationwide to ensure optimal HIV care for YBMSM clients, as VSS can be easily integrated into
their existing linkage and case management services. Several HIV service organizations have expressed a
need for VSS and will support the project as collaborators.
There are three specific aims to our proposal. AIM 1: Complete development of the VSS and Provider
Dashboard in collaboration with YBMSM living with HIV and Providers. AIM 2: Conduct an RCT with YBMSM
living with HIV (n=264 at 5 sites) to assess impact on HIV care continuum and quality of life outcomes. AIM 3:
Conduct a qualitative evaluation of VSS among HIV providers and YBMSM living with HIV.
In Year 1, we will complete development of the VSS product and conduct usability testing and consultation of
advisory boards of service providers and YBMSM living with HIV. Year 2 will involve a randomized control trial
and a qualitative evaluation of VSS. Following Phase II, VSS will be ready to be marketed and rapidly deployed
to HIV service providers and organizations throughout the U.S. to have rapid, wide-scale, and sustainable
impact on HIV care outcomes for YBMSM."

The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) Center for Precision Genetics (JCPG) will develop and disseminate new,
precise mouse models that are tailored to match, as closely as possible, the disease characteristics of the
afflicted patients. Through a nomination process initiated by collaborating clinical experts, patients, advocates
or foundations, the JCPG Steering Committee will select and prioritize models for development and preclinical
data collection. The JCPG will leverage JAX's long-established expertise in bioinformatics, mammalian
genetics and disease modeling to integrate and refine existing resources, services and infrastructure to create
a pipeline for development of precision mouse models for the biomedical community. These mouse models
will then enter state-of-the-art animal facilities for maintenance and protection as they are prepared for
distribution to biomedical and research entities worldwide.
The JCPG expertise includes computational biologists, geneticists, molecular biologists, genetics technology
experts and many clinical collaborators in diverse disease areas. This team not only brings together broad
expertise in a range of human disease areas but also extensive ongoing experience in operating an array of
large-scale public resource services. This group has a proven ability to work effectively with clinical experts to
identify and delineate disease modeling needs as they emerge and then create new mouse models that serve
the varied needs of the diverse set of stakeholders that need mouse models to develop new clinical
treatments.
The activities of the JCPG seek to achieve the following five goals. 1. Assemble and refine a comprehensive,
scalable, and flexible pipeline for the generation and characterization of precision mouse models of human
disease. 2. Build a data analysis and dissemination infrastructure that facilitates development of next-
generation predictive models using an interactive public-facing process. 3. Accelerate the development of
novel, precision therapeutics by linking patient data with new precision animal models to inform preclinical
study design and generate the data needed for clinical trials. 4. Develop and deploy a robust outreach, project
nomination, and project management infrastructure that expands and facilitates access to all JCPG resources
by the public and biomedical community while promoting and distributing new mouse models through existing
infrastructure. 5. Gain efficiencies by integrating the JCPG with other JAX programs, resources, and external-
facing services and thereby establish a scalable, financially sustainable model development pipeline."
10820149,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The objectives of the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI) and Cleveland VA Prevention and Intervention Epicenter
are to develop novel interventions that will prevent the colonization and spread of antibiotic resistant (AR)
bacteria that cause hospital acquired infections (HAI), and to develop diagnostics and interventions to combat
the colonization by the rapidly emerging fungal pathogen Candida auris.
The proposed Epicenter will leverage our network of clinical collaborators at multiple hospitals throughout the
United States at inpatient acute care, outpatient, and long-term care settings. In addition, this Epicenter will
benefit from greater than a decade of experience at JCVI managing large collaborative multidisciplinary projects
such as the Human Microbiome Project (HMP), Microbial Sequencing Center (MSC), Genome Sequencing
Center (GSC), Genomic Centers for Infectious Disease (GCID), Pathogen Functional Genomics Resource
Center (PFGRC) and Pathema. JCVI (under the leadership of Principal Investigator Dr. Derrick Fouts) has a
longstanding relationship with the Cleveland VA having collaborated on several AR bacteria projects within the
GSC and GCID centers and on a currently funded DoD wound microbiome project.
Emerging multidrug resistance (MDR) is making treatment of infections caused by CDC high priority bacterial
(e.g., carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and
fungal (e.g., Candida auris) pathogens increasingly ineffective and is a major global health concern. We will
accomplish our goals by the creation of an Epicenter consisting of four Phase T0 Core projects covering the
Prevention Epicenters Program Research Priorities of Decreasing AR infections (Core project 1), Microbiome
(Core project 2), Understanding and decreasing transmission (Core project 3), and Diagnostics, Asymptomatic
colonization and Containment of novel resistance (Core project 4). Specifically, we will use commensal bacteria
or their products to disrupt biofilms caused by AR bacteria to decrease infections in Core project 1, protect and
restore nasal and gut microbiomes using bacteriophage in Core project 2. We will also reduce the transmission
of AR caused by conjugative plasmids by using sex pilus-specific phage and CRISPR-targeted digestion of
plasmid-borne genes in Core project 3. And finally, novel diagnostic and probiotic approaches will be developed
to enable better detection and reduce asymptomatic colonization by the newly emerging fungal pathogen C.

We enthusiastically propose to renew our CDC Prevention Epicenter, entitled “InterMountain Program in
Antibiotic Resistance and microbial Threats (IMPART). Our proposal assembles an exceptional group of
investigators who have an extraordinary capacity to conduct large-scale observational studies, as well as lead
or co-lead interventional studies that range in scope from small pilots to multi-community randomized trials The
University of Utah is the hub for our program, with Intermountain Health, a large regional integrated health
system, serving as a major node. The Veterans Affairs (VA) Salt Lake City Healthcare System is another key
partner for our Prevention Epicenter site, operating within a programmatic network that encompasses the
entire VA health system. The resources that we bring to the CDC Prevention Epicenter Program will be broadly
beneficial to its mission to improve healthcare safety and prevent healthcare-associated infection. We have
accumulated the experience in translational research and expertise in multi-disciplinary methods to make
significant contributions to improve the quality of antibiotic use, combat antibiotic resistance, and enhance
health system response to microbial threats across the continuum of care. Moreover, we have developed a
computational environment to support comprehensive epidemiological analysis of infections within the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Health System, as well as Intermountain Healthcare and University of
Utah Health (UHealth). Our proposed research has a high level of significance for policy-making and
implementation. Core Project 1 evaluates alternative implementation strategies for outpatient stewardship and
advances dissemination of best practices for AS. Core Project 2 tackles a longstanding source of controversy
in the healthcare epidemiology community, namely, the role of active surveillance and contact precautions
(CP) in preventing healthcare-associated infection due to endemic multi-drug resistant organisms (MDRO)
such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). A period of partial CP deimplementation in some
VA facilities, triggered in response to the emergence of COVID-19, creates the opportunity to study the impact
of this natural experiment. Core Project 3 links an epidemiological analysis of transmission pathways in LTC
facilities to the development and implementation of novel approaches to improve practice. Core Project 4
confronts the global health challenge of COVID-19, to enhance preparedness for future epidemics and
increase understanding of how to control healthcare spread of both seasonal and novel viruses. We are
committed to active engagement with other Prevention Epicenter sites on collaborative projects and to work
closely with public health entities at national, state, and local levels. We also pledge to contribute to
programmatic domains and pathogen-specific workgroups set up under the auspices of the Prevention
Epicenter Program. For all of our activities, close alignment with the health priorities of CDC will be
established, along with substantial programmatic involvement of CDC staff."

10929332,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Overall
Initially identified on MRI in 1986 as “…incidental lesions of uncertain clinical significance associated with
cerebrovascular risk factors”, white matter hyperintensities (WMH) are a common consequence of the aging
process exacerbated by vascular risk factors. WMH also influence cognition and evolution of WMH are
associated with declines in both memory and executive function while extensive WMH predict incident MCI,
stroke and dementia. WMH and infarction also have a negative impact on cognition independent or in addition
to concurrent amyloid status. The impact of WMH is consistent with evidence that clinical dementia is a
multifactorial processes. The impact of WMH on dementia is also consistent with the fact that dementia risk
scales emphasize the role of vascular risk in dementia prediction.
As the US population becomes increasingly older and more diverse, the number of Americans with dementia is
expected to rise substantially, particularly for those with concomitant vascular disease. Importantly, the impact
of vascular disease on dementia risk may be exacerbated in African Americans and Hispanics, who are at
greater risk for vascular disease and for whom vascular disease may play a larger role in clinical dementia.
As awareness of dementia increases, it is becoming common to see individuals presenting for clinical
assessment with minor cognitive complaints. Neuroimaging studies frequently identify “incidental” WMH,
usually ascribed to “microvascular disease” by radiologists, raising patient concerns about their brain health
and future risk for dementia. To date, however, we are not aware of any studies that have
comprehensively examined the impact of individual and combined MRI measures of white matter injury
on cognitive performance among a diverse, non-demented, stroke free population with cognitive
complaints over an extended period of observation. To address this important gap in scientific knowledge,
we propose the following aims:
Aim 1. To identify the extent and characteristics of white matter injury that influence cognitive and health
outcomes
Aim 2. Evaluate Mechanisms of progression of White Matter (WM) Injury on Cognition and Health Outcomes
Aim. 3. Based on findings from Aims 1 and 2, build and validate a predictive risk model with the ultimate goal of
increasing the understanding of precision medical management and planning needed by patients with white
matter lesions, both for need for care as was inclusion criteria for future therapeutic studies.
Impact: Given recent data showing that the impact of vascular risk factors on dementia can be modified by
effective treatment in later life potentially lessening population burden of dementia, developing strategies that
recognize and precisely treat the contribution of VCID to dementia burden is a public health imperative."
10800812,"Neutralizing antibodies are likely to be required for an effective HIV-1 vaccine. However, few candidate vaccines
efficiently elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) following vaccination. Recently, the VRC working group
has elicited fusion peptide-directed bNAbs in guinea pigs and non-human primates (NHPs). Similarly, we recently
elicited bNAbs in rabbits following heterologous NFL (uncleaved) trimer-liposome prime:boosting at Scripps
where we activated B cell responses with targeted N-glycan deletions in the priming immunizations
(Dubrovskaya et al, Immunity 2019). We isolated two rabbit bNAbs that recapitulate the serum activity. These
bNAbs are directed against two distinct sites of Env vulnerability. The elicitation of neutralizing responses was
enhanced by targeted N-glycan deletion, high-density liposomal array and heterologous trimer restorative
boosting Env. In independent experiments in guinea pigs, we have elicited bNAbs in multiple animals also using
a N-glycan deletion, heterologous Env NFL prime:boost approach. These recent outcomes are encouraging
inroads toward the successful solution of a 3-decade-long problem. The new era of near-native trimeric spike
mimics, coupled with particulate array, structure-informed design and high-resolution analysis of Env-specific B
cell and lymph node responses, afford new opportunities to more efficiently elicit bNAbs. We propose an
integrated, multi-faceted approach blending the expertise of world leaders in HIV Env trimer design, analysis of
B cell responses and Abs following vaccination, NHP immune tissue analysis and EM-based analysis of ongoing
immune responses and high-resolution Ab:trimer interactions. We will use well-ordered trimer prime:boosting
that elicited bNAbs in rabbits and guinea pigs to elicit such responses in NHPs, translating success in small
animals to NHPs using novel immunogen design and presentation in Project 1 (Wyatt) and immunization of NFL
trimers into NHPs via Core B (Silvestri). We will use “real-time” serum Fab-to-trimer binding evaluated by EM
polyclonal IgG epitope mapping (EMPEM) in Core C (Ward) in complement with rapid mAb NGS-based mAb
cloning, sequencing and functional expression in Project 2 (Karlsson Hedestam). In collaboration with the VRC
(Mascola) we will define either non-neutralizing mAbs to mask unwanted non-neutralizing epitopes or to better
display the epitopes of cross-neutralizing mAbs. We will compare NFL trimer-liposomes to cell surface NFL trimer
array expressed from the exciting mRNA lipid encapsulation technology. We will assess if immunization in the
juvenile NHP B cell repertoire compared to adult macaques will better generate bNAbs as is observed during
human infection. To follow our discovery of a tier 2 CD4bs-directed bNAb following trimer-liposome vaccination,
termed E70, we will target the CD4bs by directed NFL trimer deglycosylation in the NHPs. Based on our recent
discovery of the very broadly neutralizing vaccine-induced mAb, 1C2, we will also focus on the gp41:120 trimer
interface. Leveraging these initial leads, we will undertake a multifaceted, cross-component integrated approach
to guide the elicitation of bNAbs in NHPs following vaccination with near-native, uncleaved NFL Env trimers."

Texas Southern University (TSU) is requesting continuous RCMI U54 support for the Center for Biomedical and
Minority Health Research (CBMHR) formerly known as the Center for Biomedical and Health Research
Excellence under the G12 mechanism. The purpose of the CBMHR is to support basic biomedical research for
diseases that disproportionately impact underrepresented minority (URM) populations (e.g. cancer, infectious
diseases). The proposed CBMHR program is being enhanced to better attract and engage new community
partnerships and address contemporary health issues that disproportionately affect African Americans. The
goals of the program are to: (1) enhance TSU’s biomedical research capability through continuous infrastructure
building and development; (2) equip all investigators to secure competitive extramural support for biomedical
research, particularly on diseases that disproportionately impact underrepresented minorities (URMs); (3)
promote professional development for new and early career investigators; (4) foster an environment conducive
to scientific inquiry that promotes new basic science research focused on diseases that affect minority
populations; and (5) provide enhanced mechanisms for the development of collaborations and partnerships with
community-based organizations. The CBMHR will be organized into 4 cores: Administrative Core (ADC),
Research Infrastructure Core (RIC), Investigator Development Core (IDC), Community Engagement Core (CEC),
and two independent research projects. Each core will be designed to support the purpose, goals and objectives
of the CBMHR. The ADC will provide oversight and administrative support as well as career enhancement
program and collaborative environment. The RIC will be organized in a manner that will allow investigators
access to advanced research facilities, instrumentation, and service-oriented scientific expertise. The IDC will
fully engage pilot projects. And the CEC will promote community engagement activities in bridging the health
disparity gaps for URMs in the Greater Houston Community (GHC). The two research projects will address
challenges of current cancer studies. At the end of five years of RCMI U54 support, the CBMHR will demonstrate
outcomes including substantial increases in publications citing NIH support, grant proposal submissions, NIH R-
type grants awarded, successful professional development outcomes as indicated by young investigators
receiving NIH funding for their research, and long-term partnerships with multiple health care providers and
community groups that together engage the URM population of the GHC in biomedical research education and
participation. The CBMHR will have an evaluation component that will monitor the progress of the CBMHR at
regular intervals and provide recommendations for improvement. We believe this RCMI award will significantly
strengthen and synergize biomedical research efforts at TSU and positively impact current and new
collaborators/partners within TSU and other institutions to facilitate high reward research with promise of
improving health outcomes for URMs in the GHC, Texas, and beyond."
10747887,"Project Summary – Overall: Developmental Mechanisms of Human Meningomyelocele
The central goal of this Program Project application is to understand mechanisms of Meningomyelocele (MM),
the most severe neural tube defect (NTD) compatible with survival, a condition in which folic acid (FA)
fortification has had a major impact on disease risk. This PPG is designed to advance biomedical knowledge
and make a high impact on our understanding of the molecular genetics of MM across the evolutionary scale,
with the purpose of advancing our ability to determine disease risk, and establish mechanisms by which FA
alters risk. MM is the most common birth defect of the central nervous system, affecting 3.7 per 10,000 live
births, and is one of the high impact conditions prioritized by the NIH for research. In our preliminary data we
have: 1] Constructed a cohort of over 1500 human trios with MM, stratified by whether the child was
conceived in a FA-supplemented geography. 2] Established Xenopus laevis as a high-throughput model
to assess human mutant alleles, gene-gene interactions, and FA exposure. 3] Established a number of
murine NTD models with measured effect of FA on penetrance and expressivity. 4] Demonstrated a proven
track record of applying these tools to study mechanisms of disease. As a result of the extensive preliminary
data presented below, we have formulated this PPG with a two-fold thrust: 1] By taking advantage of the
technical revolution in next generation sequencing and CRISPR genetic engineering, we will uncover and
functionally assess new MM risk factors. 2] By comparing phenotypes across the evolutionary timescale, we
will enhance our understanding of the basic mechanisms of NTDs and the impact of FA. The central theme
running throughout the application is Gene-Environment Interaction (GXE), because of the important role
FA has on MM risk in human, mouse and frog, and because the theme applies to all three Projects and Cores.
Three Cores will carry out essential functions and benefit each Project. 1] Administrative Core to facilitate
communication and provide opportunities for scientific collaboration. 2] Epigenomics Sequencing Core to
provide essential functions in assessing FA-dependent DNA methylation and other impacts on chromatin and
transcription. 3] Bioinformatics Core to provide essential functions in data processing and harmonization,
mutation identification, and custom computational solutions.
Specific Aims of the PPG are: 1] To uncover a host of new developmental causes of MM from this unique
human cohort, as well as from mouse and frog models. 2] To explore mechanisms by which FA reduces
disease incidence in human, mouse and frog. 3] To utilize mechanisms uncovered in mouse and frog NTD
models to inform gene prioritization in human MM. We believe that this PPG will have a major impact on our
understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying NTDs, taking advantage of new
breakthrough technology, and will set the stage for improved diagnosis and ultimately prevention of disease."

The unifying theme of this proposal is the aim to use state-of-the-art technologies to investigate the basic
biology of mammalian organ development and human structural birth defects. Our approach is wide-ranging,
and aims to demonstrate how utilization of powerful technologies can inform many disorders. Importantly, this
proposal marries a number of strengths of investigators at Seattle Children’s Research Institute and the
University of Washington Department of Genome Sciences; specifically, expertise in the diagnosis and
understanding of human congenital malformation syndromes and mammalian developmental biology, and the
application of powerful new techniques for biological investigation.
In Project 1, we propose to use single-cell RNA sequencing (sci-RNA-seq) technology to characterize mid-
gestation embryos of mice carrying mutations relevant to human structural birth defects. Essentially, we are
proposing to utilize sci-RNA-seq as a phenotype, with which one can annotate changes in expression and cell-
type representation during abnormal organogenesis. Ideally, these profiles will be comparable to each other,
and can potentially provide insight into fundamental biological pathways that are perturbed when
developmentally important genes are lost.
In Project 2, we will leverage recent advances in 3D imaging, computer vision and machine-learning to make
the morphological characterization of mouse mutants more accurate, quantitative, reproducible and accessible.
Progeny from the same lines studied in Project 1 will be harvested at E15.5 and imaged using microCT
scanning. We will then employ several different data analysis techniques to identify differences in the tissue
volume and shapes in the mutant mice compared to synthetic image constructed from a pool of ‘normative’
samples.
The goal of Project 3 is to use novel technologies in prospective cohorts of children with structural birth defects
to identify genetic variation not ascertained by current methods. These “hidden” variants include structural
rearrangements, as well as DNA mutations that arise post-zygotically and are not present in blood-derived
DNA. We will use long-read based DNA and RNA sequencing methods, or deep short-read based DNA
sequencing of multiple, non-blood derived tissues, on patients with structural birth defects whose clinical
workup has been non-diagnostic."

PROJECT SUMMARY
The abiding philosophy of the Johns Hopkins Division of Rheumatology is that the critical pathway to
understanding human autoimmune rheumatic diseases is through the study of large numbers of well-defined
patients, followed over time, with the collection of rich phenotypic data, mapping disease trajectory, and where
possible, acquiring and storing relevant biological materials from blood and target tissue. This repository
of data and samples can then be used to separate heterogeneous diagnostic groups into more homogeneous
subgroups, using tools that span the entire spectrum of investigation. This P30 provides the framework for
organizational (oversight, management), operational (recruitment, sampling, processing), measurement, and
analytical (statistical, computational, and integrative) expertise to enable effective clinical and translational
research. The RDRCC competitive renewal comprises an Administrative Core (Core A) led by Drs. Antony
Rosen and Clifton Bingham, and includes 3 scientific Cores: (i) Core B is the Precision Medicine Data
Integration Core, co-led by Dr. Bingham and Dr. Ami Shah; (ii) Core C is the Sample Processing and
Immunoassay Research (SPIRE) Core, co-led by Dr. Livia Casciola-Rosen and Dr. Erika Darrah; and Core D
is the Data Science Core, led by Dr. Scott Zeger. The Center is structured as a matrix, designed to foster
collaborative and synergistic discovery by maximizing access of the diverse research community to data and
samples from humans with rheumatic diseases. Core A will promote efficient, interdisciplinary research
throughout the research community and Cores, and manage the enrichment program. Core B will work with
our Centers of Excellence to bring their research operations onto the Johns Hopkins Precision Medicine
Analytical Platform (PMAP) enhancing clinical and research integration through the Epic electronic medical
record system. Core C will coordinate patient sample processing, storage and distribution, and provide multiple
immunological assays for discovery and validation of biomarkers and disease pathways. Core D will provide
highly innovative tools to enable analysis of complex longitudinal data in rheumatic disease patients,
particularly with the design and application of hierarchical models to identify disease subsets."

With the rapid increase in the number of potential variants being identified through whole genome sequencing
technologies in patients with rare disorders, the challenge for geneticists is now to confirm that these variants
are causative of the phenotype. This requires detailed assessment and annotation to separate the causative
variant from those that are simple nonsignificant polymorphisms and sequencing or mapping errors. This is a
complex problem to address requiring interdisciplinary approaches, detailed bioinformatic analysis, the
generation of informative animal models, and a concerted effort to evaluate the variants. Accomplishing this goal
is frequently beyond what an individual lab can easily or efficiently accomplish. In this regard, the Center for
Clinical and Translational Science and the Precision Medicine Institute assembled a team of scientists and
clinicians with expertise in basic research, computational and data sciences, human genetics, clinical diagnosis,
and animal model generation to form the UAB Center for Precision Animal Modeling (C-PAM). The team has
established a pipeline in which research and clinical community nominated variants will be thoroughly analyzed
using an innovative bioinformatic toolkit generated by the C-PAM Bioinformatics Section. Selected variants will
be modeled in animals by the C-PAM Disease Modeling Unit and the new models evaluated for human disease
relevance by clinicians in the C-PAM Pre/Co-clinical Section. Once generated, C-PAM established collaborations
will utilize the detailed informatic analyses and the animal resource that will be distributed through the C-PAM
Resource and Services Section to advance our understanding of disease pathogenesis, to ascertain efficacy of
novel or repurposed therapeutics, and to contribute to improved human health. C-PAM will leverage and organize
our already existing expertise to fulfill our vision to become a national resource for efficient and cost-effective
analysis of pathogenicity of gene variants identified in patients with rare disorders and to produce informative
animal models to pursue disease mechanisms and targeted therapeutics."

The introduction of clinical exome sequencing, whole genome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and metabolomics
has transformed our ability to diagnose patients with suspected genetic disease. With the introduction of these
technologies, a potential molecular DNA lesion can be identified in at least 25-30% of patients with a suspected
genetic diagnosis. These technologies have also led to the discovery of hundreds of new disease genes and to
phenotypic expansion within known genetic diagnoses. This continued discovery of new disease genes leads to
structure, function and mechanistic discoveries that assist personalized approaches for management and
therapy. However, up to 70% of patients with suspected genetic disease remain undiagnosed likely because
their disease-causing variant(s) has yet to be discovered or the clinical significance of identified variants remains
unclear. Precision models produced using various genome modification techniques in Drosophila melanogaster
(fly) and Mus musculus (mouse) are important tools aiding in the interpretation of these variants of uncertain
clinical significance and are critical for testing therapeutic paradigms. We will leverage the expertise,
infrastructures, and established collaborations between the rare, Mendelian disease clinical and gene discovery
programs; fly, mouse, and nonhuman primate animal modeling programs; and database infrastructure programs
within the Department of Molecular and Human Genetics (DMHG) at the Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) to
establish the BCM Center for Precision Medicine Modeling (BCPMM). The vision of our Center is to support
local, national, and international programs and individual researchers in the development of precision models
that will end the diagnostic odyssey of patients with undiagnosed, rare, and Mendelian diseases and serve as
resources for pre-clinical studies investigating personalized medicine approaches to their care. We will
achieve these goals by pursuing the following aims: (1) leverage existing multidisciplinary expertise within BCM
to design, generate, and identify precision animal models for studies that answer clinical questions with impact
on patient care; (2) conduct demonstration projects that showcase the Center’s capacity to model undiagnosed
and rare diseases and to translate model organism findings back to patient care; (3) Engage human genome
discovery programs, clinicians, and researchers to recruit disease-associated variant nominations for precision
model studies within the Center; (4) Perform bidirectional translation of findings from precision animal models
and from patient clinical studies for integration into clinical diagnostics, clinical care, or clinical trials; (5)
Implement bioinformatics platforms that optimize Center disease modeling and organizational activities.
Although our initial focus will build on our expertise in undiagnosed, rare, and Mendelian diseases, our long-term
goal is to broaden our scope by establishing collaborations with investigators and programs focused on
multigenic and common disease."
10766668,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is the most common aortic pathology, and accounts for approximately
10,000 deaths annually in the United States. While many preclinical therapeutics have shown great promise,
pharmacological interventions have not shown significant inhibition of AAA enlargement. The goal of this
proposal is to develop an intravenously administered nanoscale material that will specifically target aneurysmal
tissue and serve as the foundation for the development of a nanotherapeutic to prevent and/or regress AAA.
Towards this goal, our laboratory has developed and evaluated a novel intravascular targeted technology
based on peptide amphiphile (PA) molecules. We have designed and evaluated several PA nanofibers to
target features of the aneurysmal microenvironment including matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), fragmented
elastin, and membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP). Our results demonstrated excellent
targeting for the MMP-2-targeting PA nanofiber. These data are ideal given that a key feature of the
pathophysiology of aneurysm formation is the upregulation of MMP-2, and that MMP-2 is overexpressed in
both small and large aneurysms. Thus, we hypothesize that PA nanofibers designed to specifically target
MMP-2 will bind to aneurysmal tissue and be biocompatible. To investigate this hypothesis, the Specific Aims
are to: 1) Characterize and optimize the structural properties and binding kinetics of PA nanofibers targeted to
MMP-2 in vitro. An MMP-2-targeting peptide has been incorporated into a PA sequence. We will determine
critical parameters for co-assembly with diluent PA to enable nanofiber formation. The resulting AAA-targeting
PAs will be characterized for nanofiber formation, structural dimensions, and MMP-2 binding kinetics of the
peptide and the co-assembled nanofiber. 2) Evaluate the binding specificity and duration of the MMP-2-
targeted PA nanofiber to aneurysmal tissue in vivo. We will induce AAA in the infrarenal aorta of male and
female Sprague Dawley rats by exposure to CaCl2 to test targeting capability of our PA nanofibers. We will
also determine optimal concentration, dose, and co-assembly ratios. We will then determine the binding
duration for the optimal nanofiber dose and co-assembly parameters. 3) Determine the biodistribution,
elimination, and safety of the targeted PA nanofiber in vivo. Specifically, blood, bile, urine, and all vital organs
will be assessed at multiple time points before/after administration of the targeted PA nanofiber to determine
biodistribution, elimination, and safety of the targeted PA nanofiber. Successful completion of this F32
research proposal will result in the development of a nanotechnology specifically targeted to aneurysmal
tissue, and serve as the foundation to develop an effective therapy to prevent and/or regress AAA formation.
The experience gained from this proposal under the mentorship of Drs. Kibbe and Ikonomidis, both established
investigators in topics relevant to this proposal, will facilitate my transition into an independent investigator by
enhancing my ability to develop, characterize, and test novel nanomaterials to treat chronic disease."

MAYO CLINIC JACKSONVILLE
Impairments of cerebral blood supply and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity cause neuronal damage, synaptic
dysfunction, and white matter injuries, which eventually lead to the pathogenic condition referred to as vascular
cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). Importantly, aging is a strong risk factor for the disease
pathogenesis. In general, aging is predicted to be caused by accumulation of senescent cells, in which the
increase of p16INK4a is one of the key mechanisms triggering cellular senescent phenotypes. Thus, the major
goal of our project is to define molecular mechanisms in which cerebrovascular senescence to the pathogenic
pathways of VCID using mouse models. Apolipoprotein E (apoE) isoforms are also critically involved in the
cognitive decline seen in the elderly. While APOE4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset
Alzheimer’s disease, APOE4 increases the risk for mild cognitive impairment and VCID. Furthermore, APOE4
also causes neurovascular dysfunction, including BBB breakdown and the reduction of small vessels.
Therefore, we hypothesize that p16INK4a expression in endothelial cells triggers vascular senescence which
disturbs the homeostasis of the cerebrovascular system during aging, resulting in VCID and that APOE4
exacerbates VCID phenotypes. To reach our goals, we propose three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will
determine the impact of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated p16INK4a expression in cerebrovascular
endothelial cells on VCID-related phenotypes in apoE3-tareget replacement (TR) and apoE4-TR mice. We
have found that cerebrovascular endothelial cell senescence induced by transient p16INK4a expression through
AAV leads cerebrovascular dysregulation in young wild-type mice. In Aim 2, we will examine how systemic
endothelial cell-specific expression of p16INK4a in conditional mouse models affects VCID-related phenotypes
depending on APOE4, accompanied with cerebrovascular single cell RNA-sequencing. In Aim 3, we will
examine the effect of senolytics on APOE4- and/or endothelial p16INK4a-mediated VCID-related phenotypes to
investigate the contribution of senescence in the AAV-based mouse and the conditional mouse models.
Collectively, these studies should provide novel insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms that
underlie VCID pathogenesis."
10891762,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) causes progressive loss of memory, for which there is no cure. A growing
understanding of memory impairment in AD suggests that alterations at the genetic and cellular levels contribute
to circuit dysfunction. By restoring these vulnerable circuits and networks during early stages of the disease, it
might be possible to reverse memory loss and slow disease progression. Recent studies have shown that GCs
receive abundant subcortical inputs from the lateral supramammillary nucleus (SuM) of the hypothalamus, and
the SuM inputs play a key role in modulating the strength of the EC inputs onto GCs. Importantly, we found that
SuM is spared of Aβ deposition even in late-stage 5xFAD mice and exhibits intact anatomical inputs to GCs in
early 5xFAD mice, thus placing SuM in an ideal position to modulate impaired EC-DG connections in AD. In
addition, we found that stimulating SuM neurons or SuM-DG pathway is sufficient to increase GC activity and
improve spatial memory performance during the NPR test through SuM glutamate release, suggesting that
increased SuM glutamate transmission is beneficial to spatial memory performance. Furthermore, using an in
vivo multi-fiber photometry recording system, we found highly correlated Ca2+ activities between SuM neurons
and DG GCs during spatial memory retrieval in the NPR test, which is disrupted in early 5XFAD mice, suggesting
that synchronized SuM-DG activity is critical for spatial memory retrieval. Based on these findings, we propose
the following three aims to evaluate whether stimulation of SuM-DG activity can restore memory and slow
disease progression. In Aim 1, we will determine whether stimulating SuM-DG activity in early AD mice restores
EC-GC connections and DG activity; In Aim 2, we will determine whether stimulating SuM-DG activity restores
interregional synchrony during spatial memory and improves memory performance in early AD mice; and In Aim
3, we will evaluate whether chronic stimulation of SuM neurons from the prodromal stage slows AD progression.
Our proposed experiments will advance our understanding of the key neural circuits that modulate vulnerable
networks during early AD pathology. Results from these studies will guide new therapeutic directions by
selectively targeting these modulatory neurocircuits for treating memory loss associated with AD."

Disruption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) clearance pathway (glymphatic system) might contribute to development
of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is characterized by excessive deposition of toxic soluble amyloid beta (A-
beta) proteins in the brain. Recent studies of mice demonstrated that impairment of the CSF clearance pathway
led to a 70% reduction in A-beta clearance, while sleep-induced enhancement of CSF flow increased A-beta
clearance by 100%. It is unclear whether or not these impairment and enhancement effects exist in humans and
how they change with aging. Technical limitations of noninvasive approaches hinder adequate study of CSF
clearance in humans. Here we propose two new techniques to determine whether CSF clearance is enhanced
during sleep, degenerated in normal aging, and disrupted in AD. Instead of studying perivascular space, this
project investigates the production (at choroid plexus), bulk flow (in parenchyma), and drainage (at arachnoid
villi) of CSF in the brain simultaneously. The overarching goal is to understand the changes in CSF clearance in
normal aging and in AD. The proposed techniques include 1) dynamic sodium (23Na) MRI that quantifies velocity
of CSF bulk flow in brain parenchyma and 2) ultrashort echo time (UTE) proton (1H) MRI that uses UTE-T2*
value to quantify calcification of choroid plexus and assess deficiency of CSF production and uses high resolution
(0.22 mm) to visualize trabecular structures in arachnoid villi and evaluate resistance of CSF drainage. We aim
to determine: 1) how age affects CSF production, bulk flow, and drainage in the normal brain; 2) the impact of
sleep on CSF clearance in the normal aging brain; and 3) whether CSF clearance is disrupted in AD patients.
This work will generate highly-desired valuable knowledge about the degeneration of CSF clearance in normal
aging and disruption in AD, which will help design and determine effective interventions for and strategies to
prevention of AD development."

The long-term goal of this project is to determine the clinical impact of metastasis-directed radiotherapy (MDT)
in men with de novo oligometastatic prostate cancer (PCa), and identify which men may be cured and benefit
most from MDT. We aim to achieve this goal through the conduct of a phase 3 randomized controlled trial with
prospective imaging and biospecimen (e.g. tissue and blood) collection. This trial is novel in that it is a
randomized North American sub-study (n=200) of the next arm (Arm M) of the international landmark multi-
arm, multi-stage, STAMPEDE trial. The ability to conduct this trial with comprehensive biospecimen collection
and imaging analysis will be achieved through our unique research team across extramural and intramural
centers, comprised of experts in prognostic and predictive biomarker signature identification, bioinformatics,
biostatistics, genomics, imaging, and clinical trial execution. We will leverage the opportunity for North America
to participate in the STAMPEDE trial to not simply identify the true impact of MDT in the first ever large phase 3
trial testing MDT in PCa, but use this one of a kind clinical trial working with the NCI to develop the first
predictive biomarkers of benefit of MDT using radiomics of conventional and molecular PET imaging, as well
as sequencing of primary, metastatic, and liquid biopsies. This goal will be carried out through three specific
aims. Aim 1 will focus on the conduct of the phase 3 randomized North American sub-study to determine if the
addition of MDT to standard systemic therapy and treatment of the primary improves failure-free survival. Five
centers will participate, including the NIH Clinical Center. These patients will all be included in the international
STAMPEDE trial with the primary endpoint of overall survival. Aim 2 will leverage the baseline CT and bone
scans collected on all patients, as well as a subset that will be sent to the NCI to have pre-treatment 18F-
DCFPyL PET/CT scans performed (n=50). Radiomic analyses and image feature extraction will be performed,
and this information will be used to identify which men benefit most from MDT. We hypothesize that a subset
of men will benefit most from MDT and be identifiable through an imaging biomarker. Aim 3 will utilize the
baseline prostate biopsy, metastatic biopsies, radical prostatectomy specimens, and liquid biopsies (circulating
tumor cells and cell-free DNA), to annotate the molecular landscape of oligometastatic PCa. This data will
then be used to develop a predictive biomarker to identify which men benefit most from MDT. International
patient samples will be banked for later validation. We hypothesize that a discrete molecular profile will
characterize which men are most likely to be cured from MDT. The impact of this work is extremely large, as it
has the potential to cure a currently incurable subset of men with metastatic PCa. Successful completion of
these aims would result in predictive biomarkers that could directly impact the clinical management of men with
oligometastatic PCa, and transform current treatment paradigms."

in NK cells has proven to be difficult using conventional viral and non-viral transfection methodologies. Alternative
delivery methods are necessary in order to make genetic modifications at reproducible and efficient rates, while
maintaining high cell viability. The proposed study uses continuous flow electric field-assisted transfection via a
proprietary Flowfect™ platform. This platform represents a novel approach to non-viral delivery in historically
“hard-to-transfect” human cells. The current research proposes to transfect non-activated NK cells with Cas9
ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) for genetic modification using the Flowfect™ platform. To achieve this goal, we have
outlined a two-phase research strategy which focuses on stability and functionality of edited NK cells both in vitro
and in vivo. Phase I will focus on optimizing transfection efficiency and maintaining cell functionality while
Phase II will focus on understanding how the Flowfect™ platform would be deployed for pre-clinical Research
and Development purposes. Briefly, our Phase I goal is to 1) determine optimal Flowfect™ conditions in non-
activated NK cells and 2) induce stable knockout of a clinically relevant NK cell target. Meeting our Phase I
milestones will help us build towards our Phase II goals of 1) successfully screening guides which result in
enhanced cytotoxicity and 2) translating these findings to high efficacy within an in vivo mouse model of Acute

10883895,"TITLE: The contribution of declines in functional connectivity to cognitive aging
Competing Renewal of NIH/NIA R01AG049722
FOA type: PA-19-056:
Abstract: The number of Americans over age 65 is projected to exceed 55 million when the next census results
become available. Unfortunately, a large proportion of older adults will experience cognitive decline that
interferes with their quality of life with many developing Alzheimer's disease. In fact, the estimated direct costs
for patient care involving Alzheimer's disease and related dementias in the United States were estimated at $277
billion in 2018 and predicted to exceed $1 trillion by 2050. Thus, developing new strategies for improving late life
cognition is vital. Both changes in the activity properties of individual neurons in the medial temporal lobe and
prefrontal cortex, as well as aberrant organization and dynamics of functional connectivity across the brain have
been linked to cognitive decline in old age and early Alzheimer's disease. Notably, however, differences in
individual neurons that are the building blocks of network functional connectivity have not been linked to large-
scale changes in the distributed brain networks that support cognition. Bridging spatial and temporal scales to
understand the mechanisms of cognitive aging is critical for developing targeted interventions to improve
cognitive function in aging and Alzheimer's disease. The long-term goal of this research program is to determine
the mechanisms of altered network-level interactions that underlie cognitive dysfunction in advanced age and
Alzheimer's disease. The primary objective of the current proposed competing renewal is to directly link the
activity of perirhinal cortical (PER) neurons in the medial temporal lobe that project directly to the prefrontal
cortex (PFC) to age-associated differences in large scale functional connectivity in the context of behavior.
Through an innovative series of experiments that integrate advanced methodologies in imaging, functional
anatomy, in vivo neurophysiology, and behavior, the central hypothesis that age-related changes in PER to PFC
projection neurons leads to disrupted dynamics of the global connectivity, manifesting as cognitive impairments
will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: 1) Determine if altered PER-PFC projection neuron activity
in aged animals mediates aberrant functional connectivity patterns, 2) Determine whether manipulating PER-
PFC projection neuron activity alters network functional connectivity, and 3) Determine the oscillatory signatures
of age-related changes in PER-PFC functional connectivity. Our rationale is that by elucidating how aging
influences systems-level dynamics, we will be better positioned to develop interventions that broadly improve
cognition. The proposed research is innovative, because state-of-the-art imaging and neurophysiological
techniques will be integrated with measures of behavioral deficits in young and aged rats in order to probe how
local dysfunction impacts larger scale network dynamics to provoke compensation or propagate impairment. The
significance of successful completion of these experiments will be to provide an unprecedented understanding
of the association between alterations at the level of single cells and brain wide functional connectivity, and how
this relates to cognitive function in old age and the early stages of Alzheimer's disease."

11036595,"The Center of Biomedical Research Excellence in Biomolecular Structure and Dynamics (CBSD COBRE) at
the University of Montana (UM) supports research that applies the methods and concepts of biophysics,
structural biology and chemistry to understand the mechanistic basis of biological processes in health and
disease. The CBSD COBRE draws from a pool of about 60 faculty members from the basic and biomedical
sciences in the College of Humanities and Sciences and the College of Health. This phase III proposal builds
on the successes of phases I and II of COBRE support for the CBSD that have led to the hiring of seven new
faculty and early career support for an additional nine UM faculty. The direct COBRE support for their research
efforts, the COBRE-supported research cores that underpin their research programs and the vibrant seminar
and mentoring programs sponsored by the CBSD COBRE have propelled these early career investigators to
success. As a cohort, they have been awarded 39 grants that brought in $16.8 million to support their research
and have generated 83 well-cited peer-reviewed publications. During phases I and II, the CBSD COBRE has
supported four research cores, the Integrated Structural Biology Core (ISBC), which provides gene to structure
services, the BioSpectroscopy Core Research Laboratory (BCRL), which gives CBSD researchers access to
state-of-the-art fluorescence lifetime and imaging instrumentation, the Molecular Computation Core Facility
(MCCF), which provides molecular docking, drug discovery and molecular dynamics (MD) platforms, and the
Mass Spectrometry Core Facility (MSCF), which applies proteomic and metabolomic approaches to CBSD
research problems. The growth in the number of CBSD researchers afforded by investment in early career
investigators and strong investment in research core infrastructure during phases I and II of COBRE support,
which has included more than $2 million in new equipment resulting from extramural equipment grants, has
positioned the CBSD well to attain long-term sustainability with phase III COBRE support. The CBSD COBRE
will use the phase III COBRE to pursue three specific aims designed to sustain the CBSD beyond phase III.

10891766,"For Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a range of pathological, genetic and biomarker data supports the
hypothesis that Amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide triggers the disease process. As AD progresses over decades,
subsequent Tau pathology and inflammatory reaction occur during progressive cognitive decline to dementia
and death. Symptoms are tightly linked to the loss of neuronal synapses in the brain, but the mechanisms causing
synapses to be removed are less clear. Recent data implicate innate immunity, microglia cells and complement
proteins in synaptic engulfment. However, the molecular mechanism by which complement proteins accumulate
focally and tag specific synapses for removal in AD remains unknown. In addition, the misfolded aggregated
peptides, Aβ and Tau, are known to interact with synapses and cause dysfunction. We hypothesize that the
tagging of synapses with microglia-derived complement components for subsequent engulfment is coupled with
synapse-specific derangements driven by neuronal interaction with misfolded protein accumulation.
 We will examine the connection between synaptic damage signals and complement recruitment.
Preliminary studies show that interruption of synaptic signaling by PrPC or mGluR5 prevents both C1q tagging
and loss of synapses in AD mice, despite persistent microgliosis and complement overproduction. We will
examine the specificity, timing and genetic necessity of a link between complement and the Aβo/PrPC/mGluR5
complex for synapse tagging and engulfment. Mechanistically, we find that C1q and C1qBP physically associate
with hydrogels composed of Aβo/PrPC/mGluR5, and this may provide a direct means for C1q selectivity. We will
test this possibility by biochemical and cellular analysis, and by genetic studies in mice. Alternatively, synaptic
signaling triggered by Aβ or Tau may regulate other molecules, which in turn recruit C1q. An arrayed expression
cloning screen for C1q binding sites revealed a novel high affinity neuronal protein binding C1q. We will test the
role of this binding site in C1q tagging of synapses, and in the loss of synapses in neurodegenerative and
developmental models."
10898638,"OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY:
Serious foodborne illness resulting from contaminated food is a persistent and largely preventable public
health problem that receives national attention every year. Dramatic advances in technology have placed
large-scale systematic food surveillance testing on the verge of transforming national strategy from
outbreak management to informed prevention. Realizing this revolutionary milestone depends on
implementing and integrating sensitive, precise, and high-throughput scientific methods, sophisticated
instrumentation, and unprecedented information connectivity. The overarching aim of this proposal is to
contribute a comprehensive and integrated food protection laboratory hub from the state of
Maryland that is capable of analyzing food across many diverse threat priorities to the national Food
Emergency Response Network. Extensive food testing capabilities across microbiology, chemistry, and
radiochemistry disciplines are all housed within a single and unified Division of Environmental Sciences
of the MDH Laboratories Administration. The current 14-track multifaceted proposal seeks to integrate
and strengthen the Laboratory’s ISO/IEC 17025:2017-accredited methods, cutting-edge instrumentation,
and expanded food surveillance testing activities across all disciplines with the goal of protecting the
nation’s food supply. Moreover, with a steadfast commitment to constant improvement, the Laboratory
further strives to implement the newest testing methods, expand capacity of key capabilities, and
participate in developmental activities with state and national partners. Finally, the proposal places a high
priority on offering young scientists opportunities to join public health service. The outcome of this
extensive and integrated plan should provide meaningful large-scale surveillance data to regulatory
partners, and define underlying food safety vulnerabilities to inform national protective strategies of the
future."

10758000,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Poly ADP-ribose (PAR) is an RNA-like protein modification whose dysregulation is linked to age-
dependent neurodegenerative diseases including ALS, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease.
PAR is a core component of stress granules, a type of membraneless ribonucleoprotein (RNP)
granules that can seed aberrant protein aggregation leading to neuropathology. Unlike RNA, PAR
can form into both linear and branched structures. Strikingly, inhibitors of PAR polymerase, which
is a class of FDA-approved anticancer drugs, were shown to mitigate neurotoxicity in cell models
of neurodegeneration, reflecting a potential role of PAR in neurotoxicity. Two laboratories at Johns
Hopkins University led by Sua Myong (Biophysics department) and Anthony K. L. Leung
(Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology ) bring together orthogonal expertise in
molecular imaging, chemical and proteomic methods to investigate the molecular basis of PAR-
driven protein condensation and aggregation mechanism responsible for neurodegenerative
diseases, which may pave new ways of developing therapy. Our recent discovery of a PAR
modifying method (Leung et al, Mol Cell, 2019) and mechanism of FUS liquid-liquid phase
separation in ALS/FTLD-linked cases (Myong et al, Mol Cell, 2019) places us in an ideal position
for tackling the poorly understood role of PAR in biomolecular condensation implicated in
neurodegenerative diseases. In Preliminary Studies, we discovered that (i) PAR is extremely
potent in condensing FUS (fused in sarcoma), an RNA binding protein localized in stress granules
and implicated in ALS/FTLD and (ii) PAR targeted proteome is enriched in stress granule
components. Building on these exciting results, we propose to uncover the role of PAR in driving
biomolecular condensation by employing single molecule, biochemical, meso-scale, biophysical
and cellular platforms."

10902010,"Project Summary: Overall
Three premises underlie the development of our NW NARCH. First, despite longstanding efforts by tribal,
federal, and state health care programs, the available data show substantial disparities in health for NW
American Indian and Alaska Native people (AI/ANs) compared to non-AI/ANs. NW tribal leaders fear that their
health status is getting worse instead of better; this fear unfortunately has been substantiated with health data
that show increases in key chronic disease conditions, instead of decreases, over the past 20 years. Second,
Indian communities distrust health research because of negative experiences with non-AI/AN researchers who
did not respect tribal needs or sensitivities, even though carefully implemented health research has the
potential to provide solutions to reduce, and ultimately eliminate, existing health disparities. Third, health
research done by highly skilled AI/ANs who are sensitive to the culture and specific concerns of NW and other
Indian communities can bridge the gap between academia and community, though currently we lack the critical
mass of AI/AN researchers necessary to accomplish this task.
In response to these three issues, we have established the NW NARCH to form a tribal-academic partnership
for community-based health research focused on eliminating racial health disparities and will continue this
partnership with this application. The 43 NW Indian communities represented by NPAIHB have a long track
record of coordinated efforts to improve their health status; our tribal-academic partnerships with Oregon
Health & Science University and Portland State University will build a wide-reaching and multi-layered
infrastructure to increase the skills of AI/AN researchers, and address health problems of critical importance to
the tribes. Our Board delegates and Board of Advisors have directed us to pursue three training projects in
this application: 1) a fellowship program that will increase the numbers of tribal people who are trained to
conduct cancer prevention research among tribal people, 2) continuation of our Summer Research Training
Institute for AI/AN health professionals, so that they can develop the skills needed to function as researchers in
their current roles with their tribal organizations 3) an applied biostatistics fellowship designed to train a cadre
of AI/AN people to conduct a variety of analyses with their own tribal data or through accessing administrative
datasets, and 4) a pilot research project on fall prevention using very high technology methods for balance
assessments.
We trust that we will have substantial impact on AI/AN communities through supporting trainees and increasing
the number of rigorously trained tribal people in conducting health and biomedical research of relevance to the
tribes…consistent with the NIH Strategic Plan for Tribal Health Research FY 2019-2023."
10883880,"REPROGRAMMING MYELOID CELL METABOLISM TO PREVENT COGNITIVE AGING AND ALZHEIMER’S
DISEASE
SUMMARY
 The brain is highly vulnerable to aging, as demonstrated by the high prevalence of age-associated
cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Human genome-wide association studies demonstrate a
dominant role for dysfunctional myeloid cells, which include brain microglia as well as peripheral
monocytes/macrophages (Mo/Mph), in increasing risk of AD. Microglia lose their normal capacities to maintain
immune homeostasis within the brain, provide trophic support to neurons, and clear misfolded proteins.
Circulating factors in aged plasma influence microglial activation and are linked to age-associated cognitive
decline. These observations point to a causal role of brain and/or systemic myeloid dysfunction in development
of cognitive decline in aging and AD.
 In our recent studies, we have identified an important role for cellular bioenergetics in regulating immune
responses in aging macrophages and microglia. Maintenance of homeostatic and healthy immune function
requires robust glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism to meet demand for energy and biosynthetic precursors.
Indeed, our recent studies demonstrate that glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration are significantly suppressed
in aging microglia and Mo/Mph, leading to an energy deficient state that promotes maladaptive pro-inflammatory
responses and decreased phagocytic potential. In this proposal we will test whether reprogramming cellular
metabolism in aging microglia and/or peripheral Mo/Mph by modulating a major inflammatory pathway, the PGE2
signaling pathway, is disease-modifying in aging and in AD model mice. There is a growing literature on how
cellular metabolism regulates immune cell function, particularly in the areas of infection and cancer. This
conceptual framework has not yet been applied to aging, nor has it been applied to cognitive aging and age-
associated neurodegenerative diseases like AD. Our approach proposed here will answer several fundamental
questions including: (1) whether myeloid metabolic deficits drive brain aging, (2) whether peripheral or brain
myeloid compartments are critical in this process, and (3) whether targeting myeloid metabolism represents a
new therapeutic approach for AD."
10795705,"Recent evidence points to αsyn misfolding and cell-to-cell transmission as critical to neurodegeneration in
Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). Key steps implicated in αsyn spread include
release, uptake, misfolding, and impaired protein degradation, yet the key molecular mechanisms that regulate
αsyn spread are poorly understood. Rab proteins are small GTPase proteins that control protein trafficking and
degradation and have been implicated in αsyn pathogenesis. Among the Rab proteins, Rab27b is highly
expressed at synaptic terminals in neurons in key brain areas affected in PD and DLB. Rab27b regulates synaptic
vesicle (SV) exocytosis and recycling. In non-neuronal cells, Rab27b regulates the distal transport of lysosomes.
We recently showed elevated Rab27b levels in αsyn models and in human PD and DLB. Furthermore, we
observed that Rab27b KD increases αsyn toxicity by disrupting autophagic flux - pointing to a protective role for
Rab27b in cells with high intracellular αsyn burden. Surprisingly, the effects of Rab27b were different in the αsyn
fibril model, in which neurons were exposed to extracellular αsyn fibrils: Rab27 KO reduced fibrillary αsyn uptake
to prevent αsyn inclusions and neuronal loss. Based on these data, we hypothesize that Rab27b plays two
critical yet potentially opposing roles in αsyn handling: 1) Rab27b promotes αsyn autophagic-lysosomal
degradation, yet 2) Rab27b can facilitate endocytosis of pathologic, extracellular αsyn as part of its role in SV
recycling. Early in disease, we propose that Rab27b upregulation is neuroprotective: Rab27b aids intracellular
αsyn clearance. Yet, as disease progresses and extracellular αsyn levels increase, Rab27b’s role in SV
endocytosis becomes maladaptive, overcoming any protective function in protein degradation, and aids αsyn
cell-to-cell transmission. Our proposed studies will examine the impact of Rab27b and its interactors on two
critical biological processes implicated in αsyn pathogenesis. In Aim 1, we will test the mechanisms by which
Rab27b promotes clearance of intracellular αsyn, and examine its interactions with other proteins involved in
autophagic-lysosomal function. In Aim 2, we will elucidate the mechanisms by which Rab27b aids αsyn entry
into neurons and determine its interaction with other synaptic trafficking proteins to mediate this effect. In Aim 3,
we will test the overall consequences of Rab27b on αsyn pathology over time in two in vivo αsyn models. A
greater understanding of the network of proteins that shape αsyn transmission will have significant impact on the
development of future therapies for PD and DLB."
10829212,"ABSTRACT
We designed this proposal to address multiple CDC Epicenters' research priorities: preventing healthcare
personnel (HCP) contamination, understanding and decreasing transmission of epidemiologically important
pathogens including emerging respiratory viruses such as COVID-19, extending antimicrobial stewardship
(AS), decreasing antimicrobial resistant infections, exploring sepsis epidemiology and prevention, quantifying
and decreasing environmental contamination, implementing a decolonization program to obtain source control
and decrease surgical site infections (SSI), applying innovative research methodology, and training the next
generation of healthcare epidemiologists. Our proposed projects range from translational stage T0 to T2 and
involve academic medical centers, a VA Medical Center, acute care hospitals, quick/urgent care centers
(UCC), surgical patients, patients discharged from hospitals, and healthcare personnel (HCP) exposed to viral
respiratory pathogens. Our long-term objectives are to: 1) improve the integration of infection prevention
measures into HCP's patient care processes, 2) improve personal protective equipment (PPE) design and use
to decrease HCP contamination and transmission, 3) improve surveillance for healthcare-associated infections
(HAI), 4) identify practical ways to decrease spread of viral pathogens, 4) improve antibiotic use and decrease
antimicrobial resistance, and 5) prevent hospital-onset sepsis (HOS) and HAI, including SSI. Core Project
(CP) I uses methods from human factors engineering, ethnography, industrial hygiene, environmental
microbiology, and computer visioning to improve PPE design, decrease HCP self-contamination, improve
integration of PPE use and hand hygiene during patient care, and decrease bacterial and viral environmental
contamination. CP II employs novel software via cellphones to expand surveillance for SSI and C. difficile
infections after discharge and to monitor HCP exposed to respiratory viruses for signs or symptoms of
infection. CP III and the Medium Optional Collaborative Project (OCP) address neglected opportunities for
AS--UCC and patients at hospital discharge--by creating and testing novel AS metrics to decrease antibiotic
prescriptions for acute respiratory tract infections in UCC (CP III) and by conducting a cluster-randomized trial
of post-prescription audit-and-review to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use after discharge (Medium OCP). CP
IV mines large administrative data sets and analyzes data from individual medical records to define the
epidemiology of HOS, validate CDC's acute sepsis event algorithm for HOS, and identify remediable HOS risk
factors that could be targets for preventive measures. The Large OCP will conduct a stepped wedge trial of a
simple, inexpensive intervention—2 doses of intranasal povidone iodine—to prevent SSI in patients with high-
energy lower extremity fractures, who are a high-risk population with few available preventive measures. The
Small OCP seeks to improve antibiograms and, therefore, antibiotic use by including geospatial information in
antibiograms. This information should provide clinicians with information more specific to their patients."

 Laboratory Flexible Funding Model (PAR-20-105)
 The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) Laboratory Services Section
(LSS) works in conjunction with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the state regulatory body, DSHS Consumer
Protection Division (CPD), to ensure food and food products in Texas are safe. As a part of an
integrated food safety system, the goals of the LSS are to facilitate and improve food testing
surveillance, inspection, and investigation in the State of Texas.
 With the funding provided by this grant, CPD will continue partnership with LSS by acting
as the LSS sampling organization. As part of the official sampling plan, LSS will test
approximately 500 samples per year under the Microbiology Human Food Product Testing track
for each year within the 5-year period of the grant. During the third year, an additional 100
chemistry samples will be added to the annual sampling plan under the Chemistry Human Food
Product Testing track. Although not a part of the official sampling plan, CPD will also collect 50
Radiochemistry samples annually test for the radioactive contamination along with identities of
radionuclides in human food product samples. Funding provided to cover sample collection
costs incurred during sample collection by CPD will only be used for costs associated with
samples collected under the Human Food Product Testing tracks.
 LSS identifies hundreds of foodborne bacterial pathogen clusters each year by using
Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) and plans to annually sequence at least 400 Salmonella,
Listeria monocytogenes, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) and other related bacterial
isolates from food and environmental samples from sources such as the FDA National
Antimicrobial Resistant Monitoring System (NARMS) meat program and universities with testing
and research laboratories. Currently, LSS does not perform qPCR screening for Salmonella.
The outcome of this project would enhance the capacity and capabilities of LSS by making this
new method available for routine surveillance testing on food/environmental samples in Texas.
 LSS intends to facilitate data exchanges with FDA by enhancing both data systems to
enable the laboratory to submit sample analysis data via National Food Safety Data Exchange
integration or ORA Partner Portal adoption allowing for more expedient decisions/actions to
promote better public health."

Overall Summary
 The Nebraska Department of Agriculture (NDA) Laboratory is applying for the Laboratory
Flexible Funding Model to build and maintain our human and animal food testing capacity in support of
the Integrated Food Safety System. The scope of ISO 17025 accreditation of the NDA Laboratory
contains six food microbiology and four food/feed chemistry methods. Over the years, ISO/IEC 17025
accreditation has become a part of our culture. We follow written procedures in our quality
management system to ensure that our analysts are trained and authorized to perform sample
receiving, sample preparation, scope methods, and to review data before issuing a final test report. We
also have piloted the submission of FDA data through the National Food Safety Data Exchange. Our
Quality Assurance teammates perform internal audits on each accredited method every four years and
our management system every two years.
 The NDA Laboratory has been an active member of the Food Emergency Response Network
(FERN) since September 2006. We have a long history of performing FERN PT exercises and a series of
small‐scale method development, validation, and matrix extension studies to strengthen our
capabilities. In times of emergency, we are able to rearrange testing priorities. We also are very willing
to take on special projects that help us enhance our human and animal food testing practices. For
instance, we participated on the Partnership for Food Protection Lab Sciences Workgroup subcommittee
to develop a Compliance Review Checklist.
 We have plans to refresh several pieces of equipment. An ABI 7500 will replace the BAX to
expand detection of food safety pathogens. We can use the ABI 7500 to develop Cyclospora testing
capacity. An Agilent LC‐MS‐MS on loan from FDA will be replaced by a Vanquish Flex binary UHPLC
coupled with an Orbitrap Exploris 120 MS. We have several ideas for chemistry method development to
enhance national food testing surveillance programs. We also plan to remodel part of our feed testing
laboratory to include more sample grinding space, which will increase our sample throughput for animal
food product testing.
 We will collaborate with agency regulatory programs to meet our sample collection needs for
human and animal food surveillance projects. These activities support Manufactured Foods Regulatory
Program Standards and Animal Feed Regulatory Program Standards. These food surveillance data can
contribute the national goal of driving risk‐based and prevention focused food safety objectives."

10931092,"This proposal describes the BioThings Explorer (BTE) platform as an Autonomous Relay
Agent (ARA). Most data integration efforts (including many being pursued within Translator) are
based on building centralized data resources. These efforts typically involve building resourcespecific
data ingestion parsers, the outputs of which are assembled into knowledge graphs and
loaded into a local database (with neo4j being a popular option within Translator).
The BTE platform takes a complementary approach to data integration, focusing on a
distributed network of knowledge providers connected by application programming interfaces
(APIs). A proof-of-concept implementation of BTE is now complete (with demos available in
[1,2]). This implementation has three components (Figure 1): a distributed knowledge graph
(distributed-KG) based on many individual web APIs ""in the wild"", a meta-knowledge graph
(meta-KG) that describes compatibility of inputs and outputs between each API, and a BTE
python client that automates the planning and execution of queries across the API network.
Relative to centralized solutions, this distributed model offers several advantages. First, the API
ecosystem is easily extensible by the community since there is no gatekeeper controlling
access to a centralized resource. The scope and output of the BTE system will continuously and
automatically improve as the community-maintained registry of API components continues to
grow. Second, the data retrieved are always up-to-date with the source and not dependent on
having a frequent synchronization schedule. Third, the distributed model is more scalable to
heavy usage since the BTE client is run on each user's own computing infrastructure, bypassing
any centralized component that could become a single point of failure.
BTE also distinguishes itself from other federated API solutions by using semantically-precise
annotations of APIs as they exist, rather than mandating any changes to the API itself. These
API annotations describe API inputs and outputs in enough detail to support initiating the API
call and interpreting the result. In contrast, other federated approaches (including some within
Translator) require APIs to conform to a common API structure. However, requirements like
these have historically been significant barriers to widespread adoption, and thin API ""wrappers""
around non-compliant APIs introduce additional complexity and technical points of failure.
The strengths of the current BTE implementation are the ease of adding new resources and the
automation of the query planning and execution. The critical challenge that we address in this
proposal is developing new methods to rank and sort the query path results that are retrieved
from BTE queries."

proline-repeat region (PRR) of UBQLN2 cause X-linked, forms of ALS/FTD, with some patients exhibiting a
pure dementia onset. In addition, ubiquilin histopathology, comprised of dense aggregates of UBQLN2 and
UBQLN1 are observed in most instances of ALS/FTD regardless of UBQLN2 mutation status. To address
pathomechanisms of UBQLN2-associated FTD we exploited the upstream activating sequence (UAS)/GAL4
system to generate isogenic Drosophila strains expressing wild-type (WT) and ALS mutant forms of UBQLN2
in different tissues and cell types. We found that UBQLN2ALS mutants elicited dose-dependent phenotypes—
including eye degeneration, motor defects, and lifespan shortening—that were more severe than phenotypes
caused by equivalent expression of UBQLN2WT. UBQLN2ALSmutants, but not UBQLN2WT, formed
intraneuronal aggregates characteristic of ubiquilin inclusions found in ALS/FTD patients. Unbiased genetic
screens identified more than 30 genetic intervals that either reduced or enhanced UBQLN2ALS mutant toxicity.
Gene mapping studies suggest that endolysosomal pathways are centrally involved in UBQLN2ALS-mediated
neurodegeneration and point toward axon guidance genes and neuronal dependence receptors as potentially
novel disease modifiers. In this R01 grant proposal we will continue genetic studies of UBQLN2-mediated
neurodegeneration in Drosophila, focusing on endolysosomal trafficking and axon guidance as lead pathways
for discovery efforts. Modifier pathways identified in Drosophila will, in turn, inform studies of iPSC-derived
motor neurons (iMNs) expressing endogenous UBQLN2ALS alleles. The specific objectives of Aim 1 are to: (a)
investigate the Rab5 gene and endolysosomal defects in UBQLN2ALS flies; (b) investigate the contributions of
the Unc-5 axon guidance pathway to UBQLN2-mediated neurodegeneration; and (c) map and validate of
UBQLN2ALS modifier genes in Drosophila. The specific objectives of Aim 2 are to: (a) establish functional
defects in UBQLN2ALS iMNs; (b) carry out proteomic analysis of UBQLN2ALS iMNs; and (c) evaluate genes
emerging from Drosophila screens in Aim 1 as genetic modifiers of UBQLN2ALS toxicity in iMNs. The combined
genetic, cellular, and biochemical studies using Drosophila and mammalian iMN models will provide important
new insights into UBQLN2-associated neurodegeneration in ALS/FTD. In addition, pathways identified in our
study are likely to overlap with and inform toxicity pathways instigated by other aggregation-prone, ALS/FTD-
associated genes."

The purpose of this proposal is to translate basic, epidemiologic, and technologic discoveries into new
strategies to prevent healthcare-associated infections and antibiotic resistance and to improve how antibiotics
and diagnostic tests are used across all healthcare settings. This work includes six Core Projects and three
Optional Collaborative Projects. The Core Projects include: (1) using a human factors engineering approach to
improve environmental cleaning in diverse long-term care settings; (2) developing and testing a clinician-
informed, electronic antibiotic-associated adverse event harm score for adults and children using data from the
electronic health record (EHR) with the goal of changing antibiotic prescribing behaviors in the hospital; (3)
developing a measure to detect episodes of organisms transmission from patients sequentially occupying the
same hospital room using data from the EHR and piloting its use as an indicator for improved room cleaning;
(4) characterizing the molecular epidemiology of extended spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales,
predicting what patients are colonized with them, and determining the role of infection control lapses and
antibiotic exposure in their transmission; (5) characterizing the nasal microbiota of neonates that develop
Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia to understand how to prevent this deadly infection; and (6) developing an
algorithm using EHR data to identify rapidly healthcare workers and patients who have been exposed to an
index patient with a transmissible infectious disease with the goal of quickly mitigating the risk of secondary
exposures. The Optional Collaborative Projects include: (1) developing a benchmark for blood culture and
blood culture positivity rates and a consensus definition of blood culture inappropriateness and using these
results to implement and evaluate an evidence-based algorithm to improve blood culture practices in a multi-
institution cohort of adult medicine patients; (2) characterizing the risk for and microbiology and geographical
patterns of central line-associated bloodstream infections that are acquired outside of the hospital (e.g., at
home, in long-term care facilities, at dialysis) and pilot a prevention toolkit to reduce the risk of infection for
patients requiring a central catheter upon hospital discharge, and (3) determining how postnatal age impacts
the association between birthweight and bacteremia rates in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in order to
develop a practical approach for reporting NICU-onset bacteremia rates that adjusts for birthweight and
postnatal age. This proposal demonstrates capacity to integrate expertise in healthcare epidemiology and
antibiotic stewardship with other disciplines—human factors engineering, data science, machine learning,
microbiology, mathematical modeling, microbiome science, and implementation science—with the goal of
identifying novel approaches to prevent healthcare associated infections and antibiotic resistance and that can
inform CDC guidance and be applied across multiple settings to reduce harm to patients and healthcare
workers."
10831079,"Project Summary
Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) and antimicrobial resistance (AR) lead to adverse patient outcomes,
including increased mortality, morbidity, and length of hospitalization. While progress in prevention is occurring,
innovative and improved strategies for prevention of HAIs, AR, and patient harm are needed. The overall
objective of this proposal is to identify potential strategies to decrease HAIs and prevent AR emergence,
transmission, and acquisition. Our Core Proposal includes 6 unique studies to address 4 specific lines of
investigation (specific aims [SA]): environmental disinfection, antimicrobial stewardship, diagnostic stewardship,
and community-acquired Clostridioides difficile infection (CA-CDI). These studies will 1) evaluate novel
strategies to decrease environmental contamination with opportunistic premise plumbing pathogens related to
hospital sinks using a) Pall filters and drain covers (SA1A) and b) engineered plasmids (SA1B); 2) identify and
evaluate innovative antimicrobial stewardship (AS) interventions and metrics to decrease AR and patient harm
a) at transitions of care (e.g., discharge) in community hospitals (SA2A) and b) related to post-operative
antibiotics (SA2B); 3) develop and validate reflex urine culture criteria to guide improved utilization of urine
cultures (SA3); and 4) evaluate and determine the contribution of environmental sources on acquisition and
occurrence of CA-CDI (SA4). These studies involve patients admitted to community and academic hospitals as
well as patients in the community setting. We will achieve this objective by using the strengths of a unique,
innovative, and previously successful collaboration between investigators in the Duke Center for Antimicrobial
Stewardship and Infection Prevention and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. We will capitalize on
programmatic strengths in both institutions: expertise in environmental disinfection, antimicrobial stewardship,
infection prevention, AR, epidemiology, surveillance, and emerging infections; access to large and unique
research networks and infrastructure; and proven success with collaborative research involving multiple
institutions. All Core Projects proposed in this application represent early stage translational research (T0-T1)
with clearly identified “next steps” that will help expedite identification and development of practices that
effectively prevent HAIs and AR. In addition, we are proposing 3 Collaborative Projects with other CDC
Prevention Epicenters Programs: 1) a cluster randomized non-inferiority crossover trial on the use of contact
precautions for MRSA and VRE acquisition (Large); 2) evaluation of the feasibility and utility of robust antibiotic
use risk-adjustment machine learning models (Medium); and 3) metagenomic evaluation to determine if and how
often endogenous flora contaminate surgical wounds (Small). These studies involve patients admitted to
community and academic hospitals. Overall, these studies exemplify our ongoing collaboration between
scientists with expertise in T0 metagenomics, bioengineering, and microbiology and researchers with expertise
in T1-T2 studies. The contribution of these studies will be significant because they will lead to new strategies to
prevent HAIs, AR, and patient harm, thereby improving the health and safety of the US population."
10883923,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progression and normal aging are complex and often heterogeneous processes
involving functional changes to neuronal and glial elements that are not just related to neuronal cell loss [1-4,
143]. Prior in vitro and in vivo data support that aberrant regulation of glutamate neuronal systems can be a
contributor to neuronal degeneration in aging and likely a contributor to the age-dependent development of AD
[1, 4, 6-8]. We think that because there is a dearth of treatment and monitoring options our study will help in the
future development of therapeutics and non-invasive spectroscopic monitoring techniques for AD. Recently, we
have successfully adapted our enzyme-based microelectrode arrays (MEAs), which are designed to precisely
measure tonic and phasic neurotransmitter release in discrete brain structures in awake animals, for use in aged
rodents and AD mouse models [54-56, 79, 112]. A major knowledge gap in AD and aging involves changes in
the excitatory/inhibitory balance between glutamate (Glu) and GABA release and regulation [9-15]. We believe
that the use of our new recording technology will improve our understanding of the glutamate/GABA interplay in
an AD model and in normal aging. Our recent studies using this superior technology now allows the
measurements of tonic and phasic glutamate levels found that rats >18 months of age have normal or elevated
basal Glu levels compared to younger rats. Thus, some animals have elevated glutamate while others do not.
As outlined in NIH Notice NOT-AG-18-051 & related announcement PAR-19-070, issues surrounding age and
its role in dementia are critical in furthering our understanding of the metabolic and pathological changes that
affect signaling in neuronal circuits and networks. We will use young and aged normal and the APPNLh/NLh x
PS1P264L/P264L knock-in mouse (APP/PS1 KI) that does not overexpress APP or PS1, or use artificial promoters,
making it an ideal system for the study of how aging affects the development of AD-related neuropathology [86-
90]. We will use our novel methods to simultaneously record GABA and glutamate signaling in either the CA1
region of the hippocampus or Frontal Cortex. We will first behaviorally characterize all animals so that we can
determine potential correlations between the behavioral performance of mice and glutamate and GABA release
and/or regulation in the hippocampus (Morris water maze test) and frontal cortex (spatial memory variant of
Morris water maze test) [115] and performed as per [116]. Finally, mice that are studied will undergo a
pathological examination to evaluate neurodegeneration by evaluating reactive gliosis may be present by looking
at Iba1 and GFAP. Collectively, these studies will allow us to compare the effects of normal aging in male and
female to the effects seen from a mouse model of AD on the balance of glutamate and GABA signaling and its
relationship(s) to cognitive function in both male and female animals towards the development of novel
therapeutics to possibly treat the development and progression of AD."
10932495,"Summary Vision Statement
This proposal is responding to the Knowledge Provider (KP) program component of OTA-19-
009 with the target of bringing high-value knowledge sources (KS) into the Translator
ecosystem and providing its underlying infrastructure and utilities (BioThings SDK + SmartAPI)
to the Translator community for future KS inclusion.
The overall goal of the Translator Program is to build a system to carry out diversified and
domain-specific queries on an integrated, scalable, continuously updated knowledge base.
Through its pilot phase, a feasible architecture design of the Translator system has been
proposed as a distributed platform with individual web APIs (or web services) from KPs as the
basic building blocks. Given the heterogeneous nature of the underlying biomedical KPs, web
APIs abstract the underlying complexity from individual KSs and provide efficient knowledge
access via web protocols (often HTTP or HTTPS) for the downstream consumers. In this
proposal, we argue that a successful Translator architecture builds upon a distributed API
ecosystem from knowledge providers.
In this distributed architecture, each KS
provides an API as the only interface for its
downstream consumers. Each API will be
maintained individually so that the burden will
be distributed as well. For downstream
consumers, they need to know precisely what
the input and output of each API are in order
to translate user queries to a sequence of API
calls and process their output. One possible
approach is to force all KS to implement APIs
with one standard, but that requires
significantly increased implementation and
on-going maintenance burdens. Sometimes,
reimplementing an API is not even possible
(e.g. a KS API from an outside group). In this
proposal, we propose a balanced solution
which allows each KS API to implement in
their own way, but provides a standard
mechanism to create semantically precise
annotations of each API’s inputs and outputs
so that the consumers know how to trigger
API calls automatically and process the
output across APIs.
We propose a staged process turning any KS into a Translator “KP-ready” API (Figure 1). For
each of the identified high-value KSs (detailed in Table 1 from the milestone section), if the KS
only provides the access of flat-file downloads, we will offer an efficient way to “API-ify” that KS
using our API development kit, BioThings SDK (Software Development Kit). Then for new APIs
we build or for existing KS APIs, we will use SmartAPI as the mechanism to semantically
annotate API’s input and output, turning them into standard-compliant KP-ready APIs to be part
of the Translator distributed knowledgebase.
During Translator’s pilot phase, BioThings SDK has been developed to power a collection of
“BioThings APIs” (https://biothings.io) which have been widely used within and outside of the
Translator community (~10 million monthly requests from ~20K of unique IPs). Our team also
developed SmartAPI (https://smart-api.info) web application, which is currently serving as the
default API registry for the Translator community."
10932497,"Component type: This Knowledge Provider project will continue and significantly extend work
done by the Translator Consortium Blue Team, focusing on deriving knowledge from real-world
data through complex analytic workflows, integrated to the Translator Knowledge Graph, and
served via tools like Big GIM and the Translator Standard API.
The problem: We aim to solve the “first mile” problem of translational research: how to
integrate the multitude of dynamic small-to-large data sets that have been produced by the
research and clinical communities, but that are in different locations, processed in different
ways, and in a variety of formats that may not be mutually interoperable. Integrating these data
sets requires significant manual work downloading, reformatting, parsing, indexing and
analyzing each data set in turn. The technical and ethical challenges of accessing diverse
collections of big data, efficiently selecting information relevant to different users’ interests, and
extracting the underlying knowledge are problems that remain unsolved. Here, we propose to
leverage lessons distilled from our previous and ongoing big data analysis projects to develop a
highly automated tool for removing these bottlenecks, enabling researchers to analyze and
integrate many valuable data sets with ease and efficiency, and making the data FAIR [1].
Plan: (AIM 1) We will analyze and extract knowledge from rich real-world biomedical data sets
(listed in the Resources page) in the domains of wellness, cancer, and large-scale clinical
records. (AIM 2) We will formalize methods from Aim 1 to develop DOCKET, a novel tool for
onboarding and integrating data from multiple domains. (AIM 3) We will work with other teams
to adapt DOCKET to additional knowledge domains. ■ The DOCKET tool will offer 3 modules:
(1) DOCKET Overview: Analysis of, and knowledge extraction from, an individual data set. (2)
DOCKET Compare: Comparing versions of the same data set to compute confidence values,
and comparing different data sets to find commonalities. (3) DOCKET Integrate: Deriving
knowledge through integrating different data sets. ■ Researchers will be able to parameterize
these functions, resolve inconsistencies, and derive knowledge through the command line,
Jupyter notebooks, or other interfaces as specified by Translator Standards. ■ The outcome will
be a collection of nodes and edges, richly annotated with context, provenance and confidence
levels, ready for incorporation into the Translator Knowledge Graph (TKG). ■ All analyses and
derived knowledge will be stored in standardized formats, enabling querying through the
Reasoner Std API and ingestion into downstream AI assisted machine learning. ■ Example
questions this will allow us to address include: (Wellness) Which clinical analytes, metabolites,
proteins, microbiome taxa, etc. are significantly correlated, and which changing analytes predict
transition to which disease? [2,3] (Cancer) Which gene mutations in any of X pathways are
associated with sensitivity or resistance to any of Y drugs, in cell lines from Z tumor types? (All
data sets) Which data set entities are similar to this one? Are there significant clusters? What
distinguishes between the clusters? What significant correlations of attributes can be observed?
How can this set of entities be expanded by adding similar ones? How do these N versions of
this data set differ, and how stable is each knowledge edge as the data set changes over time?
Collaboration strengths: Our team has extensive experience with biomedical and domainagnostic
data analytics, integrating multiple relevant data types: omics, clinical measurements
and electronic health records (EHRs). We have participated in large collaborative consortia and
have subject matter experts willing to advise on proper data interpretation. Our application
synergizes with those of other Translator teams (see Letters of Collaboration).
Challenges: Data can come in a bewildering diversity of formats. Our solution will be modular,
will address the most common formats first, and will leverage established technologies like
DataFrames and importers (like pandas.io) where possible. Mapping nodes and edge types
onto standard ontologies is crucial for knowledge integration; we will collaborate with the
Standards component to maximize success."

The main objective of the Division of Laboratory Services (DLS) at the Kentucky Department for
Public Health is to maintain ISO/IEC 17025: 2017 accreditation (achieved in November 2018
for food chemistry and microbiology testing) and enhance testing capabilities by expanding the scope
of current accreditation by officially adding WGS analyses for food microbiology. ISO/IEC 17025
accreditation is one of the most important standards for testing laboratories and attests to the
competency and technical capability of a laboratory to perform specific tasks. The results generated
are defensible to a recognized standard. In addition, accreditation supports the traceability of technical
results generated by a laboratory. In the event of a large-scale terrorist activity or other large-scale
events affecting foods or food products, States and Federal authorities can use laboratory test results
from accredited laboratories to respond rapidly with streamlined analytical review and enforce
regulatory compliance to protect the safety of the nation's food supply. DLS is the primary servicing
laboratory for conducting microbiological and chemical food analyses on behalf of the KY State
manufactured food regulatory program (MFRPS) in the Department for Public Health / Food Safety
Branch, which has a current food safety inspection contract with FDA and is enrolled in the MFRPS.
DLS has a quality management system that is in compliance with the managerial and technical
requirements of the ISO/IEC 17025:2017 standard. DLS is a Food Emergency Response Network
(FERN) Laboratory and participates in Food proficiency testing and will continue to submit laboratory
results through what will become the ORAPP, as requested. The Division of Laboratory Services’s
goal is to enhance laboratory activities by bringing in new testing capabilities such as Cyclospora
detection for food micro and toxic metals by food chemistry.
Funding of this proposal will assist the KY State MFRPS in achieving conformance with Standard 10
“Laboratory Support” of the MFRPS and will contribute to production of accurate and reliable test
data, a quicker acceptance of analytical results by FDA, and other regulatory agencies for
enforcement actions, surveillance purposes and response to foodborne outbreaks. In addition, DLS
will continue to participate in GenomeTrackr activities and PTs as well as develop partnerships with
other agencies such as the KY Department of Agriculture and the USDA for sample acquisition and
testing."

Project Summary
The California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory System (CAHFS) is California’s state veterinary
diagnostic laboratory, responsible for assuring the health of the state’s agricultural animals and safety of
foods of animal origin. The CAHFS Toxicology Section occupies a unique position as a highly experienced
and well-equipped veterinary toxicology laboratory and is a natural fit as a partner to the FDA in
furthering their mission of protecting food and animal feed in the U.S. from unsafe chemical
contamination.
CAHFS proposes to assist the agency through participation in several key activities as outlined in the
FOA. First, the CAHFS Toxicology Section will provide significant surge capacity to the agency in the
event of an emergency incident involving intentional or accidental chemical contamination of human
food or animal feed. The Section’s past performance in addressing food-related emergencies
demonstrates its usefulness in these situations.
Where new analytical capabilities and capacity are needed, the Toxicology Section will develop new
methods, participate in multi-lab method validations, evaluate new analytical platforms, and endeavor
to address emerging food and feed safety issues with creativity and tenacity as requested. These
activities are critical in helping the agency address new chemicals of concern and in adopting more
sensitive and selective detection capabilities. Evaluation of new analytical platforms assists the agency in
identifying more efficient methods of analysis, allowing for expanded analytical capacity.
Additionally, CAHFS will perform surveillance analysis of livestock feeds produced in California. CAHFS is
seeking funding for both sampling and analysis. The Toxicology Section will work in partnership with the
California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA), which is the state agency in charge of regulating
animal feed. CDFA will provide samples taken as per FDA specifications to the laboratory for analysis.
Test results involving samples which do not meet regulatory requirements will be reported to both the
FDA and to CDFA. CAHFS understands that this funding opportunity involves a great deal of cooperation
with CDFA regulators as they become partners in providing samples. By building this type of cooperation
and testing these samples, the Section will be able to assist the agency in quickly identifying emerging
contamination issues, preventing exposures to contaminated food or feed, ultimately preventing injury
to human and animal health."

10875715,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability in the United States. The major contributors to stroke-related
disability are motor and cognitive deficits, which tend to worsen over time, especially in aged individuals. Stroke
also accelerates other age-related diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy
(CAA). The prevalence of respiratory dysfunction is high in stroke patients and it impairs recovery and increases
mortality. Studies investigating the mechanisms underlying stroke-induced respiratory dysfunction (SIRD) are in
their infancy. Even less is known about how disordered breathing can influence motor and cognitive outcomes
after stroke, especially in aged individuals that have other features of neurodegeneration, including cerebral
amyloid. There are currently no animal models of post-stroke respiratory dysfunction, limiting our ability to
investigate the mechanism of respiratory dysfunction after stroke or to develop interventions to stabilize breathing
to improve cognition. Our preliminary data shows that stroke leads to the development of periodic breathing and
apnea in mice, the severity of which is correlated with both mortality and progressive cognitive decline in
survivors. Stroke is also very common in AD and CAA patients and SIRD may contribute to cognitive decline in
AD and CAA, increasing amyloid burden. Treatment of stroke disordered breathing may decrease Aβ burden
and reduce neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in AD and CAA patients with vascular disease. We have
recently discovered that stroke induces astrogliosis in brain areas remote from the infarct, including
chemoreceptor areas of the brainstem and reducing gliosis specifically in brainstem improves SIRD and
cognition. Mechanistically, we will determine the cellular source (likely astrocytes at the neurovascular interface),
the molecular mediators (likely transforming growth factor β, TGFβ), and the physiological contribution of this to
the development and progression of SIRD and cognitive decline. We have developed an animal model of post-
stroke respiratory dysfunction that recapitulates the physiology seen in stroke patients and is tightly linked to
post-stroke cognitive function. We will now investigate sex differences in this model and investigate if stroke
accelerates cognitive decline in transgenic mice that develop AD or CAA. Finally we will determine the
mechanisms responsible for stroke-induced respiratory pathophysiology and will attempt to develop therapeutic
approaches to stabilize breathing and enhance recovery of cognitive function. Our central hypothesis is that the
severity of disordered breathing correlates with cognitive and motor decline after stroke in wild-type, AD and
CAA mice and that this is secondary to widespread age-enhanced astrogliosis, leading to impaired
chemoreception and progressive apnea. The proposed work will determine how stroke affects control of
breathing in “normal” aging, in AD and in CAA, and whether treatments designed to improve this respiratory
phenotype reduce disease progression."

The Nevada State Public Health Laboratory (NSPHL) is the only public food-testing
laboratory in Nevada. Analytical food testing is provided to Nevada’s regulatory
agencies and health authorities assessing foods for regulatory compliance, emergency
response and foodborne outbreak investigations.
The NSPHL is the primary testing laboratory for Nevada’s Manufactured Food
Regulatory Program (MFRP) testing submitted foods monthly. In addition, the NSPHL
has been a CDC PulseNet Laboratory providing PFGE analyses, and more recently
whole genome sequencing testing, for foodborne related pathogens statewide.
The NSPHL is the designated FERN laboratory in Nevada as well as a Tier I
Laboratory Response Network (LRN-B) Biological and LRN-C Level II Chemical
Laboratory performing Select Agent/Hazard testing on a variety of matrices.
Over the past few years, the NSPHL has been working toward ISO/IEC 17025:2017
Accreditation. The initial onsite A2LA Assessment is scheduled for July 23-24, 2020.
The NSPHL is seeking to maintain the existing food testing capacities under the
ISO/IEC 17025:2017 scope while supporting the MFRP. In addition, enhancement of
the testing scope to include whole genome sequencing methodologies, radiochemistry

10884092,"Project Summary/Abstract
Oxygenated lipid mediators (oxylipins) derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are potent signaling
molecules that regulate a multitude of cellular and systemic responses, including inflammation. Epoxy fatty
acids (EpFAs) are cytochrome P450 (CYP)-dependent derivatives of PUFAs. They are a group of lipid
mediators with potent anti-inflammatory, pro-resolving properties. However, their activities are extremely short-
lived as soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) quickly converts EpFAs to pro-inflammatory diols. Our therapeutic
hypothesis is that inhibition of sEH will increase and prolong the anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving actions of
chemically stable EpFAs to exert neuroprotection. This approach has been proven promising for Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) by independent results from our and other groups showing that Inhibition of sEH activities, either
by specific inhibitors or gene knockout, mitigates AD-like abnormalities in various AD models. Our results open
a new avenue to investigate how oxylipins regulated by the CYP-sEH pathway affect brain function. sEH
protein is most highly expressed in the liver, where it may influence brain function in a long-range fashion via
controlling the lipidomic structure of lipoproteins transporting EpFAs. In the CNS, microglia activation is
particularly sensitive to sEH modulation via the autocrine actions of EpFAs. We propose a “sEH-regulated
brain-liver axis”, aberration of which may affect lipoprotein and microglial functions to contribute to AD
development. Furthermore, sEH may functionally interact with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) to regulate lipoprotein
composition and microglia activation in AD. We propose a comprehensive approach to survey the dynamic,
AD-relevant regulations of lipid mediators in animal models, human AD samples, and human microglia cultures
in three specific aims. Because previous sEH inhibition studies in AD models did not address the exact cellular
and molecular mechanisms that afford neuroprotection, in Aim 1 we will direct the sEH gene knockout in APP-
PS1 AD mice specifically targeted to microglia and hepatocytes, two key cells whose function is hypothesized
to be severely affected by overactivity of sEH in AD. We will determine if such targeted deletion can mitigate
AD-like phenotype in mice, and identify specific molecular mechanisms by integrated transcriptomic and
lipidomic analyses of liver, brain, and plasma lipoproteins. Same lipidomic analyses will be used in Aim 2 to
determine that brain bioactive lipid profiles and plasma lipoprotein lipidomic structures are differential in AD
patients vs. non-demented controls across APOE genotypes. In Aim 3, we will characterize Aβ oligomer (AβO,
a potent neurotoxin in AD brains)-induced and APOE genotype-dependent alterations of CYP-sEH signaling
and oxylipin profiles in human iPS-derived microglia. We will test the hypothesis that AβO induces a unique
microglial pro-inflammatory state by tuning down anti-inflammatory EpFAs, and this ability is modulated by
APOE genotype. Completion of this project will provide specific sEH-regulated mechanisms via which liver and
microglia may contribute to AD pathology by regulating lipid metabolism and possibly by interacting with ApoE."

 of Pet Food Samples
Abstract
We are submitting a proposal for Discipline A: Microbiology, track 3 for Animal Food Product
testing with Dog treat food/Salmonella as a hazard to Commodity pairs. Here we combine
different expertise from 2 laboratories, Laboratory of Renewable Resources Engineering (LORRE)
and the Office of Indiana State Chemist (OICS), to assemble a proposal consisting in animal food
sample collection, accelerated food sample preparation to bring microorganisms of interest to
detection levels, FDA approved loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for Salmonella
screening in animal food, and whole genome sequencing as a method for confirmation of pathogen
isolates. We have further optimized our sample preparation approach, as a follow up to 2015 FDA
challenge award, and we now can simultaneously concentrate and recovery microorganisms of
interest in 4 samples, bringing their numbers from initially not detectable, due to be present at
initial levels of 1CFU/g or lower, to detection levels. This accelerated processing of samples is
complete in a time frame of about 4 hours. It consists of a microbial short enrichment in selective
medium combined with an enzyme treatment, followed by a pre-filtration step to remove large
particles and microfiltration to concentrate and recovery selected microorganisms to detection
level. The enzyme treatment helps to break down possible biofilms formation and particles that
may clog pores in the hollow fiber membrane during microfiltration. Enzymes selected are based
on food matrices. In the case of the samples proposed here, proteases possible combined with
lipases will be used. We have shown the enzymes do not affect microbial viability, when in the
presence of their respective substrates. While we have focused on Salmonella as a microorganism
of interest, our developed approach can also be applied to other microorganisms. The Office of
Indiana State Chemist (OISC) microbiology laboratory has major expertise in sample collection
for animal food testing. It has also many years of experience in microbiological method
development, testing for antibiotic concentration, and bacteria enumeration and identification,
including several years of pathogen screening for Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes,
Campylobacter and Escherichia coli (STEC) in animal feed. Last year, the OISC microbiology
laboratory contributed for testing in a national wide Salmonella outbreak in pet treat pig ear in

10795708,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alzheimer's disease (AD), defined by the presence of beta-amyloid and tau, is the most common cause of
dementia worldwide. Neuropathological studies have, however, revealed that in the majority of AD cases, beta-
amyloid and tau are accompanied by the presence of other abnormal proteins. One such protein is the TAR
DNA binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43), which is present in over 60% of AD cases. It has now become
apparent that TDP-43 plays an important role in the AD neurodegenerative process. As such, our team has
found strong associations between the presence and burden of TDP-43 and: (1) episodic memory loss, (2)
smaller hippocampal volumes at death, (3) faster rates of hippocampal atrophy 10 years prior to death, and (4)
the apolipoprotein epsilon 4 genotype, all which support TDP-43 as one of the important players in AD
neurodegeneration. Recently, we reported two different types of TDP-43 deposited in the brains of patients
with AD that we termed TDP-43 type-α and type-β. TDP-43 type-α is similar to TDP-43 seen in the brains of
patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP) while type-β, is different, and is
associated with neurofibrillary tangles, and hence tau. What is currently lacking though is an understanding of
the mechanism/s underlying TDP-43 neurodegeneration in AD. TDP-43 is an RNA-binding protein known to
regulate many facets of RNA metabolism; thus, TDP-43-associated toxicity in AD may result from the
accumulation of key aberrant transcripts as a result of TDP-43 mislocalization to the cytoplasm, abnormal post-
translational modifications to TDP-43 and/or TDP-43 sequestration into inclusions. One of these key aberrant
transcripts may be the recently discovered truncated transcript variant of a microtubule-associated protein that
is involved in axonal regeneration, termed stathmin-2 (STMN2). It has been demonstrated that decreased
levels of TDP-43 lead to the accumulation of a truncated variant of STMN2 that lacks exons 2 through 5
(tSTMN2). Our exciting preliminary data shows that in FTLD-TDP, tSTMN2 is significantly elevated in frontal
cortex where it correlates not only with TDP-43 burden but also with age at onset, yet not with survival after
onset, suggesting that increased tSTMN2 RNA accelerates disease onset but does not alter the rate of disease
progression. Therefore, given similarities between TDP-43 type-α in AD and TDP-43 in FTLD-TDP could the
accumulation of tSTMN2 be involved in the mechanism of TDP-43-induced neurodegeneration in AD?
Furthermore, given the link between TDP-43 type-β and neurofibrillary tangles, are there other unique aberrant
transcripts that are specific towards toxicity in AD and which contribute to the pathogenesis of AD? We will
leverage our knowledge and experience with clinical, pathological, neuroimaging, molecular and biological
aspects of TDP-43 in AD and FTLD, by assessing relationships between STMN2, TDP-43 (including type-α
and type-β), and clinical and neuroimaging features in a large cohort of 756 clinically and pathologically well-
characterized cases with AD neuropathologic changes."

10878826,"Summary: Overall
Since 2016, North Carolina State University (NCSU) has helped expand the GenomeTrakr program on a national
and global scale to target some of the leading causes of foodborne illnesses worldwide. The need for surveillance
of foodborne pathogens is urgent because despite advances in hygiene, food and water quality and pathogen
detection, foodborne illnesses remain a tremendous burden for public health. The environment and food products
such as retail meats are implicated as sources of foodborne pathogens, and establishing standardized
surveillance of these sources can help monitor key pathogens and trace contamination routes to prevent and
control outbreaks. To date, NCSU GenomeTrakr laboratories have generated 3,328 whole genome
sequencing (WGS) profiles of bacterial pathogens isolated from multiple sources. This includes profiles
of 1,127 bacterial isolates from 9 countries outside the US over the last three years. They have also trained 23
students and professionals from 10 countries, which has led to 11 original publications of GenomeTrakr
program data in peer-reviewed journals coauthored by the investigators and their US and international
trainees. Since 2016, the investigators have worked to expand their global network to now include 13 countries
spanning three continents. Consequently, the overarching aim of this project is to continue enhancing WGS-
based surveillance of bacterial pathogens associated with foodborne illness at the national and global level using
a One Health approach. This will be achieved through surveillance activities, partnership building and training
students and professionals. The investigators will leverage their extensive leadership experience in surveillance
protocols, advanced molecular techniques and data analysis, and their status as a WHO Collaborating Center
for AMR and One Health to build capacity in the US and globally through world-class training for students and
professionals. To achieve this, they will pursue the following specific aims. Aim 1 (Project): Expand the existing
surveillance system of bacterial pathogens related to foodborne illness that have been isolated from food and
environmental sources in the US and international locations. Aim 2 (Project): Compare WGS profiles of bacterial
pathogens isolated from national and international samples to advance outbreak investigations and track
emerging strains of public health importance. This work will be supported by two aims of the Administrative Core:
Aim 1 (Admin): Provide leadership to complete the proposed aims in collaboration with national and
international institutions. Aim 2 (Admin): Provide a framework to educate and equip the future surveillance
workforce with the knowledge and skills needed for WGS analysis. Expected Outcomes: The investigators are
committed to fulfilling the GenomeTrakr mission and expanding standardized surveillance systems across the
globe. By characterizing 400 new isolates from US and international sources from new and existing collaborators,
and by building capacity worldwide, this work will help public health agencies track the emergence of new strains,
curb the distribution of foodborne pathogens and reduce the burden of foodborne illnesses in the US and globally."
10563194,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in cognitive impairment, which can be long-lasting after moderate to severe
TBI. Currently, there are no FDA-approved therapeutics to treat the devastating consequences of TBI and
improve recovery. A wealth of experimental evidence shows that mitochondrial dysfunction is poised to be a
pivotal link in the neuropathology of brain injury. We previously have targeted bioenergetic impairment with
mitochondria-directed therapeutics, including mild mitochondrial uncouplers, which have shown to be
neuroprotective. These uncouplers facilitate the movement of protons from the mitochondrial inner-membrane
space into the mitochondrial matrix, thereby reducing the mitochondrial membrane potential (∆ψ). While
complete uncoupling of mitochondria would be detrimental, we have published data showing that transient or
“mild uncoupling” confers neuroprotection in preclinical models of TBI. Recently, we demonstrated that a prodrug
of 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), MP201, a mitochondrial uncoupler with better pharmacodynamic properties including
higher tolerability and extended elimination time, rescues acute mitochondrial bioenergetics, reduces oxidative
damage, increases brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and is neuroprotective. We hypothesize that the
optimal dosage and timing of therapeutic intervention of MP201 is neuroprotective across species following focal
contusion brain injury. Our proposed studies will explore how MP201 administration can improve acute,
longitudinal, and chronic outcomes, paired with critical biomarkers, including platelet physiology and
neurochemical profiles. To achieve this, we will use innovative techniques across multiple institutions to assess
synaptic and non-synaptic mitochondria in both porcine and murine models of TBI. Additionally, we will extend
our findings to examine therapeutic efficacy, measuring longitudinal cortical morphology (T2/DTI scanning),
neurometabolite profiles (MRS scanning), platelet signature (as a novel biomarker and biosensor), and cognitive
behavior. Finally, we will explore the underlying mechanism behind the long-term neuroprotection imparted by
MP201 after TBI, examining BDNF levels and mitochondrial restoration. With strong preliminary data and utilizing
many innovative and clinically-relevant techniques, we anticipate this proposal will generate ground-breaking
data. Overall, this proposal will highlight highly translatable therapy by MP201 to alleviate negative outcomes of
TBI."

Project Title: Hawaii' FERN Microbiology Laboratory's Role in Keeping Human Food Products Safe
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that each year 48 million people get sick from
foodborne illness, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die. Hawai'i's unique ethnic and racial diversity, immigrant
population, as well as its geographic location makes a unique public health jurisdiction. Our remoteness to the
continental United States and the closest US state to the neighboring United States Affiliated Pacific Islands
(USAPI) adds to this complexity. Furthermore, eighty five percent of food supply in Hawaii is imported.
The overarching objective of the proposed projects is to enhance and strengthen the capacity and capabilities
of Hawaii's FERN Microbiology laboratory in keeping human food products safe. To accomplish this objective,
we are requesting funding for Discipline A, Analytical Track 1: Food Defense, Analytical Track 2: Human Food
testing, Analytical Track 5: Microbiology Capacity/Capability development – Cyclospora and Discipline D: Special
Project: ORAPP Integration. By participating in the food defense project, the HI FERN Microbiology laboratory
aims to prepare and respond to possible intentional microbiological contamination of food products not only in
Hawaii but to serve as a surge laboratory on a national scale. Secondly, by participating in Human Food testing,
HI would like to contribute to the national food testing surveillance program with the aim of removing potentially
contaminated food products out of reach by consumers and aid in inspections and investigations. Thirdly, we
would like to develop our capability for Cyclospora testing. Berries which has been implicated in human
cylcosporiasis in the US was listed on the 2016 top 10 imported agricultural commodities to Hawaii by the HI
Department of Agriculture. By developing this capability, testing can be done in-state without the need to send
to the nearest FDA Office which is five hours away by air. Lastly, ORAPP integration funding will allow us to
seamlessly submit violative and surveillance reports to the FDA in a timely manner."

consumers, and promotes preparedness. The State Hygienic Laboratory has been engaged in maintaining
quality systems in the laboratory in compliance with ISO/IEC 17025 since September 2013 and maintains
AIHA Laboratory Accreditation specifically for the food scope by providing the resources - including systems,
equipment, and personnel - to ensure adherence to rigorous QA/QC protocols and appropriate accrediting
authority/agency standards. The aims of this overall application are to: 1) ensure laboratory capacity for the
analysis of foods, 2) strengthen and enhance food response in urgent and emergency situations/outbreaks,
and 3) enhance currently validated and potentially develop new analytical methods. The SHL management and
technical staff supporting food safety have substantial experience in the public health laboratory. SHL chemists
and microbiologists have performed food analysis for surveillance, outbreak and inspection samples since the
early 2000s. SHL has all required and supplemental resources for full continuation of the food program in Iowa
beyond the end of the FDA ISO 17025 and FDA FERN programs. SHL performs food operations in two lab
locations. Within lab locations are BSL2 and BSL3 suites, biosafety cabinets, and fume hoods. Instrumentation
includes ICPMS, LCMSMS, GCMSMS, IC, proportional counters, liquid scintillation counters, alpha and
gamma spectrometers, thermocyclers, and substantial support equipment. AIHA program certificates for food,
unique scopes, industrial hygiene and environmental lead are current for these locations. SHL is accredited by
the National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program (NELAP) with oversight from the Oregon
accrediting authority. SHL is supported by a LIMS developed and maintained in-house. A quality management
system is in place and guided by the Quality Management Plan. Incorporated in the quality systems are a
document control system (iPassport), a non-conforming event (NCE) protocol and a schedule of internal
audits. Safety is addressed through substantial training and education requirements. There are improvements
and new applications proposed that include expanded capability in Radiochemistry for rapid alpha-emitter
screen, expanded capability in Chemistry for the analysis of juice and other sugary products and applying
SHL's Microbiology validated in-house Cyclospora RT PCR assay to produce surveillance. In future years,
SHL Microbiology plans to validate Endopep-MS procedure for C. botulinum toxin to replace discontinued
ELISA toxin kits and particularly the mouse assay. In addition, the implications of COVID-19 on food and food
surfaces is a critical emerging research area in virology testing that will need development for this aim

Abstract
The New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH) Public Health and Environmental Laboratories (PHEL) is
pursuing the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cooperative agreement program focused on improving
the capability and capacity of NJ to maintain food safety in support of FDA priorities. This initiative is achieved
by testing foods for microbiological, chemical, and radiological contaminants while further integrating the three
analytical disciplines into a unified food testing program to effectively respond to any foodborne outbreaks and
contaminations. To address these tasks, NJDOH is proposing a New Jersey Food Testing Program (NJFTP)
and committing to achieving the overall project goals of enhancing food defense in NJ and improving food testing
capabilities and capacity for NJFTP.
Specifically, NJFTP will participate in: 1) triage exercises and surveillance activities, 2) national security events,
3) testing associated with credible or suspected threats to food supply 4) other food defense/food safety
assignments and proficiency tests 5) training seminars, conferences, and teleconferences, and 6) group testing,
functional exercises, and results reporting. Additionally, NJFTP proposes the following five initiatives to further
support and assist in its mission: 1) analyzing pre-packaged bags of lettuce for the presence of Escherichia coli
O157/Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and Salmonella species with characterization of the
microorganisms by biochemical analysis and whole genome sequencing (WGS); 2) conducting WGS on
historical Vibrio vulnificus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus isolates recovered from local clam and oyster harvests
3) testing various commercially available food items collected from retail stores in NJ to survey microbiological
(Francisella tularensis, Burkholderia sp., Brucella sp., Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis), chemical (toxic
elements, toxins/poisons, and pesticides), and radiochemical (low-level iodine-131, gamma emitters, Cs-137, I-
131, and alpha/beta emitters such as Am/Pu and Sr-90) contaminants, 4) developing methods to expand the
capabilities to quantify pesticides in fruit- and vegetable-based beverages and low-level I-131 in milk, and 5)
expand sample throughput capacity throughout PHEL.
The test results will be relayed to the FDA and other regulatory agencies to initiate investigations and remove
potentially harmful products from the market. By conducting the work detailed in this proposal and managing an
integrated food safety system, NJDOH will be able to expand its food defense activities while further safeguarding
public health and supporting FDA priorities by providing our federal and State partners with critical microbial,

Breaking down barriers to translational research is the key to finding new approaches to inflammatory arthritis
and related diseases in adults and children. Four years ago, with P30 support, we built the Joint Biology
Consortium (JBC), a shared infrastructure based at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Boston Children’s
Hospital, to accelerate the work of an arthritis-focused Research Community now spanning 18 research
centers across the United States and abroad. Based on the success of the JBC, we propose to continue and
expand the fundamental design of three Cores designed around the shared needs of JBC members to
enhance the efficiency of existing studies, facilitate innovation, and foster junior investigators.
1. The Administrative Core is the organizational heart of the JBC, coordinating operations and cultivating the
scientific potential of the JBC research network, coordinated through the JBC Web Portal. The JBC Synergy
Meeting and Visiting Professor program promote scientific interchange, the JBC Workforce Development
Group promotes a diverse and inclusive research pipeline, and the JBC Enrichment Program incorporates
innovations from award-winning mentors to support JBC Young Investigators via grant aims review, mentoring,
and 12 yearly JBC Microgrants of $5,000 to facilitate utilization of JBC services for pilot and feasibility studies.
2. The Human Biosamples Core provides “one-stop shopping” for adult and pediatric biospecimens essential to
research in arthritis and related diseases. The HBC leverages 19 distinct sources of samples. The new JBC
Recruitment Core provides targeted prospective recruitment from over 100,000 consented individuals based
on phenotype and, in many cases, genotype to build a unified pipeline for biospecimens across the lifespan.
3. The Cellular Systems Core provides resource- and expertise-intensive tools for arthritis research. Next-
generation sequencing tools include single-cell RNAseq, CITE-seq, ATAC-seq, T-scan, PhIP-seq, and spatial
transcriptomics, while protein-based services include CyTOF, tissue mass cytometry, and custom Luminex, all
analyzed with assistance and education from the new JBC Bioinformatics Core.
Spearheaded by committed investigators and mentors Director PI/PD Dr. Peter Nigrovic and Associate
Director and Co-PI Dr. Elizabeth Karlson, the JBC spurs innovation within a deliberately inclusive and highly
collaborative network of senior and junior investigators, enabling the Joint Biology Consortium to continue to
grow as an engine of translational research in adult and pediatric arthritis and related disease."
10795709,"Project Summary
Intracranial electrical brain stimulation (EBS) remains a central method in the clinic as well as for research in
several animal model systems. However, little is actually known about the ensembles of neurons activated by
typical and clinical intracranial EBS protocols. These stimulation protocols often require a trial-and-error
learning period (during and after invasive neurosurgery) to determine what stimulation parameters are
effective, if any at all are effective. It remains mysterious why some stimulation patterns work in the clinic
while others do not, and what underlying ensembles are activated by various stimulation patterns.
It is known that focal electrical microstimulation activates nearby excitable membranes, including neural
somas, dendrites, and axons. It is also known that the recruited ensemble of neurons may be locally non-
homogenous and that clinical effects may rely more on axons of passage than somatic stimulation. Efforts to
model EBS cannot overcome our current gaps in knowledge about the homogeneity of local propagation and
brain-wide extent of activation. This ambiguity demands a more detailed understanding of local electric field
propagation, particularly in the in vivo mammalian brain. Utilizing recent technological advances, we propose
to fill these gaps empirically with high density electrophysiological monitoring and temporally precise
fluorescent labeling methods, to quantify clinically relevant activation patterns with high spatial resolution
and cell-type specificity.
Here we propose an experimental study in mice, based on a biophysically realistic model of mouse cerebral
cortex, of the spatial and temporal propagation of activation via focal EBS. The study will test the hypothesis
that local electrical stimulation is non-isotropic and cell-type specific. We propose to measure EBS stimulation
with more than 1000 electrodes arranges in three dimensions around a site of stimulation, in combination with
genetic cell type identity through optotagging (Aim 1). To agnostically isolate brain-wide ensembled activated
by EBS, we couple a fluorescent reporter to electrical stimulation for ex vivo whole-brain tissue clearing and
light sheet imaging (Aim 2)."

The Manufactured Food Regulatory Program Standards (MFRPS) and Animal Feed Regulatory
Program Standards (AFRPS) established a uniform foundation for management of state
programs responsible for the regulation of facilities including laboratory analysis for chemical
and microbiological contaminants. The Georgia Department of Agriculture (GDA) participated in
a 2011 Improvement Plan followed by a five-year cooperative agreement to obtain ISO/IEC
17025 Accreditation. This project was later supported by a two-year Accreditation Maintenance
and Enhancement grant and an addition year to expand upon accreditation in order to support
the regulatory agency’s primary servicing lab. GDA laboratories achieved, enhanced, and
maintained accreditation which assists their regulatory agencies in compliance requirements for
contractual work on behalf of FDA.
 In order for GDA laboratories to maintain their accreditation and support the regulatory agency
as their primary laboratory, continuous support is needed to offset the added expense required
for Quality Assurance activities as well as the ongoing upkeep of critical analytical equipment.
For state partners to accept added responsibility for Global Food Safety initiatives continued
support and enhancement will be necessary for the primary servicing labs to maintain analytical
capability for meeting these goals. To achieve these goals the laboratory will rely upon
established relationships with our regulatory agency and their agreement to collect and analyze
samples under the MFRPS and AFRPS agreements for possible regulatory enforcement. GDA
has already developed and demonstrated successful relationships with their regulatory partners
and ability to fulfill this objective. Signed agreements have been previously forged to collect and
analyzed samples for contaminants using state inspectors and robust sampling plans. These
results will be submitted in a national database repository and violative adulterations will be
subject to appropriate regulatory action. This grant will allow GDA laboratories to maintain
accreditation to international standards, protect the public by collecting and analyzing samples
for contaminants and to cumulatively contribute to an integrated national food safety system."

10883908,"Our proposed study focuses on developing deep neural networks and sophisticated multivariate analysis
methods for studying episodic memory activations in prodromal AD subjects and age-matched normal controls.
We are particularly interested in investigating the effects of spatial and object pattern-separation in subfields of
the hippocampus, nearby regions of the medial temporal lobe, and functional whole-brain connections. In order
to acquire a fuller understanding of the underlying physiological processes driving AD pathology, activations in
hippocampal subfields must be investigated in further depth and with methodologies that exceed the current
limitations of fMRI at 3T. Acquiring data that will yield a more accurate view of these hippocampal interactions is
far more easily facilitated with 7T technology, although barriers complicate such a study even at 7T. Our
proposed study centers on circumventing these barriers, particularly data contamination from excessive system
noise, head-motion noise, and physiological noise which is proportional to the field strength, to develop methods
that will allow investigators to work within the parameters of 7T at its fullest capacity toward the development of
more powerful imaging biomarkers for diagnosing AD. To increase the likelihood of the successful completion of
our study, we consider it imperative to develop better task fMRI designs and imaging protocols (Aim 1), automatic
segmentation methods (Aim 2), noise-reduction methods (Aim 3), and multivariate analysis methods, such as
novel algorithms and software tools based on constrained canonical correlation analysis (constrained CCA),
kernel CCA, and deep CCA and relevant group-level analysis using fusion CCA, multiset CCA, and machine
learning and deep learning techniques (Aim 4) for studying memory function to obtain novel imaging biomarkers
(Aim 5) to identify individuals at risk for AD. This study will enable the creation of clearer and more detailed brain
activation maps and thus promote the discovery of currently unknown aspects of brain function in prodromal AD.
The successful completion of our objectives could lead to more effective diagnostic tools for AD, including an
fMRI-based diagnostic test for memory impairment to characterize abnormal memory function in people at risk
for AD. Our advanced methodology, combining 7T high-resolution fMRI, automatic segmentation, data denoising
and multivariate analysis, will be essential for detecting subtle functional changes in subfields of the hippocampus
and its connections to other cortical regions. Results from this study are expected to broadly impact scientific
understanding of brain function beyond only enhancing current understanding of memory function in AD. We
anticipate that the methods developed from findings acquired in our proposed study will have a far-reaching
influence on improving fMRI data quality, enable more accurate detection of brain activation, open a path toward
better automated and instantaneous hippocampal subfield segmentation for many other MRI/fMRI applications
of neurodegenerative diseases, and contribute new and vital discoveries to the field of neuroscience in general."
10883886,"Aging and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) differentially affect the hippocampal subfields. A robust,
reliable imaging tool is needed to evaluate the hippocampal subfields and distinguish early AD
from normal aging. Though recent neuroimaging studies have harmonized the labeling of the
whole hippocampus with success, multiple groups have parcellated the hippocampus further
into subfields and highly variable results emerged. Conflicting reports exist about atrophy
changes along the aging-Alzheimer’s continuum. The hippocampus contains selective
vulnerable cell populations. Identifying pyramidal cell profiles for all subicular cortices, CA1,
CA2, and CA3 is essential to develop rigorous, cell-validated definitions for the hippocampal
subregions and to corroborate these as reliable biomarkers is a critical step to determine AD
vulnerability. Histology is required to differentiate subfields accurately. Our overall goal is to
characterize the hippocampus subregions based on cells, not layers or microanatomical
features. The objective of this proposal is to create twelve histologically-validated hippocampal
subfields based on novel, cellular criteria (size, pattern, directionality measures) and apply this
neuroimaging map to in vivo populations. This regionally integrated map will establish new
cellular readouts for the hippocampal formation that represent the subpopulations most
vulnerable in AD. The project will combine high-resolution ex vivo MRI, a preclinical brain tissue
collection, and our neuroanatomical expertise. Aim 1 will establish a novel neuroimaging tool
that segments twelve hippocampal subfields in FreeSurfer. Aim 2 will validate hippocampal
subregions histologically with Nissl staining corresponding to the same cases and establish
novel anatomical and cellular frameworks for each subregion: pyramidal cell diameter
measures, pyramidal neuronal pattern profiles from cell directionality measures and our triple “c”
protocol to compute architectonic boundaries. Aim 3 will apply the hippocampus subfield
segmentation tool to 3 T in vivo MRI data including the Harvard Aging Brain Study, the Human
Connectome Project, Alzheimer’s disease Neuroimaging Initiative and validate against
established biomarkers. Our regionally integrated subfield map is needed to disambiguate aging
from AD in terms of specificity, sensitivity and reliability in early prediction of AD. The work – at
the microscale – will generate well-validated standards that will help to disentangle cellular and
network vulnerabilities in healthy aging from AD in future in vivo functional, longitudinal, or
therapeutic studies."
10892344,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a multifactorial and complex neurodegenerative disorder that involves
numerous genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors. Advances in genomics have identified new
genes and rare variants that are associated with AD. However, the molecular mechanisms of how these
factors contribute to AD pathogenesis are largely undefined. In collaboration with the CHARGE
(Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology) consortium, we recently identified a
rare missense variant in TM2D3 that is associated with a significant increase in the risk of late-onset
AD (LOAD). Furthermore, a recent study by an independent group reported that another rare missense
variant was found in a patient with early-onset AD. Although the function of this gene has not been
explored in vertebrates in vivo, our experiments using fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, suggests
that this gene is a potential regulator of a key enzyme that process APP, a precursor protein that
produces neurotoxic Ab42 peptides that contribute to AD. In this proposal, we elucidate the molecular
function of TM2D3 and its related family members (TM2D1/2) to understand their role in APP
processing and AD pathogenesis using Drosophila. Flies are excellent model organisms to genetically
dissect molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration. Moreover, since APP is processed by the same
set of enzymes that activate Notch, a pathway affected in TM2D3 mutant flies, rich research
infrastructure for Notch signaling studies in Drosophila greatly facilitates the mechanistic study of this
protein in vivo. By combining genetic, cell biological, biochemical, electrophysiological and behavioral
methodologies, we will uncover how TM2D3 and its relatives modulate proteolysis of membrane
proteins to understand how rare missense variants in this gene affects the risk of LOAD and EOAD in
humans. Such understanding will provide novel insights into AD pathogenesis and will deliver a new
framework to understand how genetic risk factors of AD may impinge on a common molecular pathway
to facilitate disease expression and progression."

conductivity boundaries in in vitro preparations can distort, weaken or even reverse the TMS-induced E-field
inside the tissue. The computed E-field values will be verified experimentally with a bipolar electrode. In Aim
1b, we will investigate the optimal bath, tissue and TMS coil geometry for producing the required E-field in the
tissue and design a flux concentrator to provide a uniform strong E-field for slice studies. In Aim 2a, we will
record extracellular and intracellular responses to TMS in the turtle Cb in vitro (intact, slice). Since the neuronal
elements in the Cb (parallel fibers (PF), Purkinje cells (PC) and PC axons) are arranged in mutually orthogonal
directions, we will orient the E-field along each axis so as to selectively stimulate different cell populations and
determine the corresponding E-field threshold. In Aim 2b, we will activate the PC via selective electrical
stimulation of the climbing fibers (CF) (via the inferior olive) and the PF (via the pons, granule cells and the
MF). We will also apply TMS on the afferent bundles in the Cb penduncle and measure the responses intra-
and extracellularly. In Aim 3a, we will use a saccade task developed by one of us to reliably activate two focal
regions in the human Cb and localize and characterize these sources using MEG-EEG. In Aim 3b, we will
compute the E-field in the human Cb using our novel E-field computation method and specify the TMS
parameters for producing an E-field matching that found in Aims 1-2 for PC and PF. In Aim 3c, we will use
TMS-modulation of the saccade by activating the focal Cb regions from Aim 3a. The TMS will be applied at
different latencies, coil orientations and E-field polarities. The effect of TMS on the saccade will be monitored
using EOG, eye tracker and concurrent EEG. The EEG will be compared to TMS-induced responses from
turtle in Aim 2. We expect that this approach will provide a direct link between the BEM simulations (Aim 1), the
turtle studies (Aim 2) and the human Cb study (Aim 3) and result in a greater understanding of the cellular
basis of TMS thus opening new applications of TMS for studying the role of the Cb in human brain function."

 The Mission of the Southwest National Primate Research Center (SNPRC) is to improve the health of our
 global community through innovative biomedical research with nonhuman primates (NHPs). One way that
 it achieves this goal is by serving as a global resource to scientists that can benefit from its expertise and
 nonhuman primate colonies. Texas Biomedical Research Institute (Texas Biomed), a private nonprofit
 research organization in San Antonio, TX, has a long history of performing biomedical research using NHPs
 dating back to the 1950s. Because of its success, Texas Biomed was chosen to host the Southwest National
 Primate Research Center in 1999. In doing so, SNPRC became the newest of the NIH funded National
 Primate Research Centers. This application for renewed NIH support of the SNPRC highlights the changes
 made in response to the reviews from the previous P51 renewal. Specifically, there have been several
 critical replacements and hires in leadership. In addition, SNPRC has restructured its internal research
 program into two Scientific Units to align with its expertise and future goals. The new Infectious Disease,
 Immunology and Control (IDIC) Scientific Unit represents research strengths developed over decades of
 primate-based research to bring greater emphasis to these areas. It is already taken advantage this Unit's
 expertise to become a leader in SARS-CoV-2 research. Meanwhile the Comparative Medicine and Health
 Outcomes (CMHO) Scientific Unit is positioned to be a leader in nonhuman primate research in recently
 emphasized research fields including metabolic disease, neuroscience, and aging. Both Scientific Units
 perform research with multiple species of primates including macaques, baboons and marmosets and are
 integrated into the overarching aims of the SNPRC which include research programs involving NHP models
 of human disease not available at other NPRCs. The SNPRC will continue to work towards its mission by i)
 To maintain healthy and well-characterized breeding and research colonies of several NHP (NHP) species
 for biomedical research, and to make them available to the scientific community; ii) To provide broad
 services in primate research to the national research community with an emphasis on specialized
 technologies and capabilities many of which are unique to the SNPRC. We provide these services to
 enhance collaborative opportunities to both internal and external investigators. Our expertise with diverse
 species of NHPs allows us to contribute ideas and perspectives about how best to accomplish the goals of
 research projects, thereby increasing the productivity and efficiency of the research, and strengthening the
 value of the data derived from it; iii) To maintain and to enhance the physical and administrative
 infrastructure of the NPRC so that it can best serve biomedical research. SNPRC has undergone significant
 changes in the Administrative structure in the past year. The benefits of these changes to efficiency and
 productivity are already apparent; iv) To advance training of staff, students, and visitors in the care and use
 of NHPs in biomedical research; v) To contribute to advances in science and translational medicine via
 publication of results obtained from research with NHPs and educational outreach to the public."
10927287,"Abstract (Overall):
Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a deadly disease whose mechanisms of development remain
incompletely understood. Evidence suggests that pancreatic cancers may arise from acinar cells undergoing a
process called acinar to ductal metaplasia (ADM) or from ductal cells to give rise to Pancreatic Intraepithelial
Neoplasias (PanINs). How mutations or combinations of mutations promote PDAC development and the role of
inflammation in the process still remains unclear. Moreover, interactions between immune cells, cancer-
associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and cancer cells can promote PDAC development and progression, but much
remains to be learned about how signaling between cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) affects the stem
cell compartment (`stemness') thought to underlie PDAC development and promotes immune evasion. Thus,
multiple questions about fundamental mechanisms governing PDAC development persist.
To address these challenges, our superb and highly interactive team will identify genetic and stromal (immune
cells and CAFs) interactions and pathways that regulate the inception and progression of PDAC using innovative
mouse models and human tissue-based approaches. We propose three Projects to address the following overall
aims:
1. Identify the originating cell(s) and deconstruct genetic pathways underlying PDAC initiation
2. Discover immune signals that cross-talk with epithelial cells and CAFs to promote pancreas cancer
development and stemness
3. Investigate the impact of tumor genetics on PDAC immunobiology and response to macrophage-targeted
immunotherapy
Effort on these projects will be organized through an Administrative and Biostatistics Core (A) and empowered
by two Research Cores, focused on human tissue procurement (Core B), and use of high-dimensional imaging
to measure cell and signaling interactions in tissues (CODEX; Core C).
The participating investigators on this P01 lead teams that have collaborated productively for years and have
generated compelling preliminary data that support the potential for unraveling the genetic and immune signaling
mechanisms underlying PDAC development, and developing new immunotherapeutic strategies for PDAC,
which has proven frustratingly resistant to immuno-based therapies.
Our studies should broadly impact pancreas cancer biology and importantly, elucidate the reciprocal interactions
between immune and non-immune compartments (epithelial, CAFs) in shaping the tumor microenvironment
during disease evolution. accelerate discovery of novel diagnostic or preventive strategies for early-stage
disease, or therapeutics for advanced PDAC."

 Aging is by far the most important driver and risk factor for developing a variety of neurodegenerative
diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias. These devastating diseases exact an
enormous emotional, social and economic toll on patients and their families, yet to date there are no effective
treatments that delay, much less reverse, the onset or progression of these diseases. Clearly, new approaches

of three research projects, each focused on an aspect of brain aging that is known to be crucial for brain function:
1) cell fate decisions, particularly cell death and cellular senescence; 2) metabolism, particularly responses
leading to metabolic reprogramming and inflammation; and 3) cell-cell interactions, particularly interactions
between neurons and non-neuronal cells in the brain. We propose to support the projects by an administrative
core, which will also provide statistical and bioinformatics support, and three scientific cores: 1) an

10890320,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by pathological
protein aggregation and inflammation in the brain (neuroinflammation). Microglia are the key immune cells of
the brain that mediate neuroinflammation. Novel therapeutic strategies and AD biomarkers can be identified if
we can define the molecular changes occurring in microglia in AD at the protein level, and not just at the
mRNA (transcriptomic) level. Our knowledge about microglial disease mechanisms in AD are mostly shaped
by transcriptomic studies although proteins are the enactors of biological processes and the correlation
between mRNA and protein is poor. The major barrier to microglial proteomic studies is the dependence on
isolation strategies to purify microglia before analyses. Isolation of microglia from brain induces artefacts,
yields very little protein and provides highly biased sampling. To overcome this barrier, we will use a novel
strategy (ciBONCAT) for microglia-specific proteomic labeling in-vivo. CiBONCAT allows us to label newly
synthesized proteins in microglia with an azide tag (azidonorleucine). These azide-tagged proteins can be
easily isolated from the brain without need for cell isolation. We have demonstrated the feasibility of using
ciBONCAT to label neuronal and astrocytic proteomes in adult mice, and have optimized the in-vivo and mass
spectrometry pipelines for proteomics using brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and other biofluids. This novel
strategy, coupled with our extensive expertise in mass spectrometry (proteomics) methods, will allow us to test
our central hypothesis that amyloid beta (Aβ) accumulation, APOEε4, and aging independently and
synergistically impact proteomic phenotypes of microglia, and that these microglia-mediated mechanisms are
reflected in the CSF via immune biomarkers of AD pathology. In Aim 1, we will use ciBONCAT to define
microglia-specific protein alterations occurring in AD using two models of progressive amyloid beta pathology
(APP-PS1 and 5xFAD). In Aim 2, we will use knock-in mouse models to determine the effect of human
APOEε4 and APOEε3 expression on microglial proteins changes and how APOEε4 impacts with Aβ pathology.
In Aim 3, we will identify microglia-derived proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid in mouse models of AD pathology
to identify novel biomarkers of neuroinflammation that reflect activation or depletion of microglia in the brain in
AD mouse models. Through the successful completion of this R01 proposal, we will obtain novel molecular
insights into microglia-mediated AD mechanisms and will establish ciBONCAT as a powerful approach to
investigate cell type-specific mechanisms of neurodegeneration. Our multidisciplinary expertise in microglial
biology and transgenic models of AD pathology (Dr Rangaraju), and quantitative proteomics, systems biology
and CSF biomarker discovery (Dr Seyfried), uniquely position us to execute this innovative R01 proposal."
10891781,"Project Summary/Abstract
Neurodegenerative disease mechanisms encompassing Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are complex and have
remained largely unknown to date despite the identification of risk factors and genetic mutations associated with
the disease. Oligodendrocytes (ODCs) have critical roles in the central nervous system where they ensheath
axons to allow rapid saltatory conduction and also provide metabolic support to neurons. Although a largely
homogeneous oligodendrocyte population is thought to execute these functions throughout the brain, recent
reports suggests that ODCs are highly diversified cell populations in the brain. Using systems biology approach,
that integrates multi-omics data from human pathological specimens and mouse models of AD, this project aims
to generate single-cell resolution genome-wide maps of transcriptional and regulatory networks in ODCs
associated with AD. The project represents a major advance in the field by taking a comprehensive approach to
data-driven discovery to identify highly conserved regulatory programs of AD. In parallel, the project aims to
understand the role of sterol regulatory-element binding proteins (SREBPs) in AD using functional genomic
approaches. Finally, the project will identify novel cell-type specific transcriptional regulators of AD using cutting
edge approaches to data science."
10884089,"Project Summary/Abstract:
 Extant literature suggests that damage to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is intricately involved in the
pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD). For example, post-mortem studies
demonstrated that ADRD brain is characterized by the accumulation of blood-derived proteins, degeneration of
BBB-specific cells, and injury of vascular endothelium. However, the relationship of BBB damage to
pathological hallmarks of dementia such as beta-amyloid, tau, and cerebral small vessel disease are not well
understood, particularly in humans. This is primarily attributed to a scarcity of in vivo techniques to evaluate
BBB function. The PI is a leading expert in non-invasive imaging of microvascular function, and his laboratory
has recently developed, optimized, and validated a MRI technique to assess BBB permeability to water
molecules. Our preliminary studies using this novel technique has shown strong evidence that 1) Significant
BBB breakdown can be detected in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using non-contrast MRI; 2)
the extent of BBB breakdown is associated with amyloid burden; and 3) BBB function can predict cognitive
function, particularly in the memory domain.
 The central goal of this application is therefore to capitalize on these technical advances and characterize
BBB breakdown in MCI and early dementia, and to understand its causal relationship to both AD and small
vessel pathology. BBB permeability to three molecules of different sizes, specifically water (molecular weight
18 g/mol), Gadolinium MRI contrast agent (molecular weight 547 g/mol), and albumin (molecular weight 66K
g/mol) will be measured in the same participants. Human patient studies will be paralleled by studies in animal
models so that clinically relevant discoveries can be validated in experimental models. The role of inflammation
in BBB breakdown will also be examined. These relationships will be studied in both cross-sectional and
longitudinal manner. This multi-modality, multi-disciplinary project has three Aims. Aim 1 will examine the
cross-sectional relationship between BBB breakdown, amyloid, tau pathology, small vessel pathology, and
inflammatory markers in 125 elderly participants including cognitively normals, MCI, and early dementia. The
inter-relationships among these variables will be studied in the framework of a mechanistic model. Aim 2 will
conduct a 30-month follow-up of these participants and investigate the longitudinal relationship between BBB
breakdown and progression of AD pathology, small vessel pathology, inflammatory markers, and cognitive
function. Finally, in Aim 3, we will validate the pathological underpinnings of BBB dysfunction in ADRD using
two novel rodent models that our collaborators have developed for AD and small vessel disease, respectively.
These rodent models with relatively pure pathology are expected to reveal more definitive relationships
between BBB breakdown and AD and small vessel pathology."
10795714,"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are two fatal neurodegenerative
diseases with no cure or effective treatment. A common pathological hallmark of FTD/ALS is the presence of
cytoplasmic inclusions formed by various RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) with intrinsically disordered regions
(IDRs). These RBPs include FUS, as well as TDP-43, TAF15, and EWSR1, which are all components of stress
granule (SG). SGs are liquid-like transient cytoplasmic membraneless organelles that form when cells are under
stress through a process called liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) that condensates RBPs and RNA. Because
SGs are enriched with FTD/ALS disease RBPs such as FUS that is intrinsically aggregation-prone, if stress
granules are not cleared in time, FUS can go through aberrant phase transition to form solid fibrillar aggregates
that can induce toxicity and neurodegeneration by sequestering other proteins and RNAs and impairing stress
granule dynamics. We hypothesize that agents able to reverse aberrant FUS phase transition and fibrillization
would restore stress granule dynamics and function, thus mitigating FUS toxicity. The long-term goal of this
project includes developing such agents with therapeutic potentials to reverse pathological aberrant phase
transition and aggregation of FUS, and elucidating the mechanism of action of these agents. During my postdoc
training, we discovered that nuclear import receptor Kapβ2 can function as a protein chaperone and a
disaggregase to prevent and reverse FUS aggregation by binding to the nuclear localization signal in the C-
terminus of FUS. Thus, we hypothesize that other FUS-binding biomolecules can also prevent and reverse its
phase transition and fibrillization. In this proposal, we seek to develop FUS-binding short RNAs as
oligonucleotide disaggregases to mitigate aberrant phase transition and toxicity of FUS. Our preliminary data
indicate that RNAs that bind to FUS protein in FUS-expressing E. Coli prevent FUS aggregation. We will first
define RNA oligonucleotides with specific sequences that can mitigate phase separation and aggregation of FUS,
and other RBPs that are implicated in FTD/ALS. Because RNA polymers are rapidly digested by ribonucleases
in the cell, to develop RNA-based oligonucleotides for therapeutic purpose, we will also design RNA analogues
with higher cellular stability. The activities of these oligonucleotides will be tested using in vitro phase separation
system reconstituted from purified RBPs. We will then define the mechanism of action of the RNA
oligonucleotides to mitigate FUS assembly. Due to the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of phase separated
FUS system, we will combine ensemble biophysical measurements and single-molecule fluorescence assays to
achieve this goal. In the final aim, we will test whether RNA disaggregases can restore stress granule dynamics
and rescue FUS toxicity in cell. These short RNA oligonucleotides identified in our study have great potential to
be developed as RNA therapeutics for FTD/ALS patients."
10795711,"SUMMARY
Currently, ~5.8 million Americans suffer from Alzheimer's disease (AD)1 and there remain no approved
therapeutics to lessen the associated neuronal dysfunction and cell death. Various AD clinical trials targeting
the “amyloid cascade” have proven unsuccessful, suggesting a dire need to rethink AD disease progression.
Alterations in cellular calcium (iCa2+) and mitochondrial function are reported as critical molecular contributors
to AD pathogenesis. Our lab has previously shown that genetic modulation of either mCa2+ uptake or efflux is a
powerful way to limit mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death in the context of cell stress featuring elevated
iCa2+. As causal evidence of impaired mCa2+ exchange in AD, we generated multiple mutant mouse models to
modulate neuronal NCLX expression, the primary mechanism for 2+ efflux in excitable cells, and
mCa
discovered that impaired mitochondrial calcium efflux proceeds neuropathology and memory decline in 3xTg-
AD mouse model. In addition to alterations in
mCa
2+ efflux, we also discovered significant proteomic remodeling
of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter channel (mtCU). The mtCU is required for acute Ca2+ uptake into the
mitochondrial matrix where it regulates mitochondrial function. The mtCU is a multiprotein channel, consisting
of pore-forming, scaffold, and regulatory components. To date, there are no published in vivo studies using
genetic models to define the contribution of mCa2+ uptake with AD disease progression and given our published
findings regarding the role of mCa2+ efflux in AD pathogenesis17, it's imperative that we mechanistically define
the mCa2+ uptake pathway prior to proceeding with therapeutic development. In this project, we hypothesize
that mCa2+overload is a primary contributor to AD pathology by promoting metabolic dysfunction and
neuronal cell death, and that reducing mtCU-dependent mCa2+ uptake will impede neurodegeneration
and AD pathogenesis. Further, using complex mutant mouse models we will systematically define the
mitochondrial metabolomic and proteomic changes associated with AD progression and alterations in mCa2+
flux. Optimally, these studies will identify new therapeutic targets for the treatment of AD."
10890253,"According to the World Health Organization approximately 50 million people worldwide suffer from cognitive
disorders. The incidence of dementia increases with age, especially for those over 65. CNS white matter lesions
are also known to increase with age and to increase the risk of developing dementia. Vascular dementia (VD) is
the second most common cause of cognitive abnormalities in the elderly behind Alzheimer’s disease (AD). VD
has been associated with various cardiovascular maladies, which are thought to contribute to diffuse white matter
disease leading to dementia. The underlying hypothesis of this proposal is that the impact of the cytotoxic
environment created by disruptions to the CNS vasculature associated with aging and diverse cardiovascular
disorders are particularly detrimental to oligodendrocyte viability and function. We posit that the heightened
sensitivity to cellular stress that oligodendrocytes display due to their unique metabolic demands makes them
particularly vulnerable to the changing extracellular environment that develops with advancing age and in
response an altered cerebral circulation. The white matter abnormalities that occur as a consequence of
oligodendrocyte perturbation are likely critical to the development of neurodegenerative, cognitive and behavioral
changes. The goal of the current proposal is to a gain a mechanistic understanding of the impact of ageing and
cerebrovascular abnormalities on oligodendrocytes, both in humans and in mouse models. Our focus will be on
examining the role that intrinsic cytoprotective pathways play in the response of oligodendrocytes to the adverse
cytotoxic environment created by these conditions. We will focus on three cytoprotective pathways: the
integrated stress response (ISR) pathway is initiated by a variety of stresses including oxidative stress, hypoxia
and inflammation; the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway is activated in response to
oxidative stress; and the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) pathway is the master transcriptional regulator of the
cellular response to hypoxia. We will examine human postmortem samples from individuals with vascular
dementia for activation of these pathways in oligodendrocyte lineage cells, and we will similarly assess their
activation in ageing mice, which are known to display oligodendrocyte and myelin deficiencies. We will also
examine a mouse model of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) for oligodendrocyte and myelin
abnormalities linked to ISR, NRF2 and HIF activation. HFpEF is a common cardiovascular abnormality
associated with dementia. We will also use a genetic approach to further examine the response of these
cytoprotective pathways to the adverse CNS environment created by ageing and cerebrovascular abnormalities.
Together, these efforts will substantially increase our understanding of the response of oligodendrocytes to the
cytotoxic CNS environment created by ageing and cerebrovascular dysfunction. A better appreciation of the
contribution of myelinating glia dysfunction to the pathogenesis of dementia is essential to our understanding of
this growing health concern and may serve as the basis for the design of neuroprotective therapeutic strategies."
10404986,"Background: Despite a great need for treatment, more than half of returning Veterans at risk for suicide do not
initiate mental health services. Such findings underscore the urgent need for strategies to increase treatment
seeking among recently separated Veterans vulnerable to self-directed violence and resistant to initiating
mental health care. The VA has embarked on the regular use of communication campaigns as part of a public
health approach designed to reach the larger Veteran population with messages promoting help seeking. What
types of messages effectively change beliefs and behaviors for at-risk Veterans is unclear. Significance/
Impact: The main objective of this study is to develop and test the use of public messaging to increase
treatment seeking among Veterans at risk for suicide and resistant to seek mental health care following
separation from military service. Innovation: Completion of the study will result in a portable data-driven
intervention that can be deployed at low cost per head by VA to effectively reach and engage the target
population in need of mental health services. Specific Aims: Aim 1: Develop public messaging to increase the
likelihood for treatment seeking among recently separated Veterans at risk for suicide and resistant to initiate
mental health care. Aim 2: Conduct a trial testing the messaging developed in Aim 1 to increase treatment
seeking for recently separated Veterans at risk for suicide and resistant to initiate mental health care. Aim 3:
Examine facilitators and barriers of message use to identify methods for effectively reaching and engaging
Veterans at risk for suicide in the first year following separation from service. Methodology: We propose a
four-year mixed methods study that uses a sequential embedded design to collect data from nationwide
samples of Veterans at risk for suicide not in mental health treatment who separated from the DoD in the past
year. Informed by the Theory of Planned Behavior, individual interviews will first be conducted to guide the
design of effective public messages that will be subsequently tested in a two-arm RCT to determine exposure
effects among targeted audience vs. control group. Messages will be disseminated to study participants during
the trial by a smartphone app. Research staff will collect assessments by telephone at baseline, 1- and 3-
months post-randomization. Potential participants (for all study aims) will be identified using data available from
the VA/DOD Identity Repository (VADIR) and recruited by invitational mailing and follow-up telephone calls.
Inclusion criteria: 1) U.S. Veteran that separated from military service in the past 12 months (any discharge
type); 2) >18 years old; 3) experiencing suicidal ideation; 4) low intent to seek help; 5) capable of
understanding the goals of the study; 6) willing and able to provide verbal consent; and 7) smartphone
ownership and willing to download/use study mobile app (for Aims 2 & 3). Exclusion criteria: 1) currently (or in
the past 12 months) in formal mental health treatment services; 2) deemed impaired during eligibility
screening; and 3) currently institutionalized. Women and minorities will be included in the study. Next
Steps/Implementation: If the intervention is found effective, we will work with our VA operational partner to
include messages in future outreach approaches to prevent Veteran suicide and use findings to improve
current communication performance measures."

aggregated α-syn has been implicated in neurological disorders with Parkinsonism including Dementia with
Lewy Body, Parkinson’s disease (PD), and Multiple Systems Atrophy. Accumulation of α-syn has even been
confirmed in over 50% of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Recent evidence points to a role of α-syn accumulation in
the aggregation of tau and Aß in AD. Thus, regulation of α-syn expression may be crucial to the therapeutic
control of numerous neurodegenerative diseases. Short interfering RNA molecules (siRNA) can bind
specifically to target RNAs and deliver them for degradation; however, RNA molecules do not cross the blood-
brain barrier so the only method for delivery is repeat intra-thecal injections. We recently developed a peptide
(ApoB11) that binds oligonucleotides for transport across the blood-brain barrier following systemic
administration. Using this peptide, we showed that we can deliver a si α-syn to reduce expression of α-
synuclein in a mouse. We recently converted the ribonucleotide backbone of this siRNA to a 2’-MOe anti-sense
oligonucleotide to increase half-life and affinity to the mRNA target. We plan to examine the pharmacokinetics
and toxicology of systemic ApoB11:2’-MOe si α-syn following intra-peritoneal delivery in an α-syn tg mouse
model of DLB. Then we will examine the ability of the ApoB11:2’-MOe si α-syn to reduce α-syn and improve
survival of neurons and improve cognitive ability and motor coordination in an α-syn tg mouse model of DLB.
Finally, we will examine the ability of the ApoB11:2’-MOe si α-syn to reduce the accumulation of α-syn in an in
vitro model of human DLB neurons derived from iPSC cells in a blood-brain barrier model. We believe this may
represent a new method of therapeutic delivery for DLB and other neurological disorders."

This study will test the hypotheses that: (a) increased gut permeability due to loss of mucus barrier accelerates
aging-related cognitive decline and AD pathology, and (b) a unique heat-killed human-origin probiotic
(Lactobacillus paracasei D3-5 [LpD3-5]) and its lipoteichoic acid (LTA) restores mucin production to reduce gut
leakage and thereby ameliorate cognitive decline and AD pathology. Our hypotheses are based on multiple lines
of emerging evidence, including our preliminary data indicating that: (i) Chronic inflammation begins several
years before cognitive decline/AD appear in humans and mice; (ii) Increased gut permeability and reduced
mucus barrier are linked with elevated inflammation in gut and brain, cognitive decline, and AD markers in older
and AD mice; (iii) A unique human-origin heat-killed probiotic LpD3-5 reduces gut permeability and inflammation
in the gut and brain of older mice by increasing mucin production and goblet cell numbers, and shows promising
improvements in cognition; (iv) A specific LTA from the cell wall of LpD3-5 increases both goblet cell numbers
and mucin production by activating toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) signaling, which in turn reduces gut permeability
and inflammation; and (v) Mucin-stimulating effects of LTA from LpD3-5 are unique, strain-dependent, and
possibly due to variations in D-alanyl modification. These findings raise several important questions: (a) whether
increased gut permeability due to loss of mucus barrier accelerates aging-related cognitive decline and AD
pathology, and whether LpD3-5 therapy can reverse these changes; (b) how LpD3-5 and its LTA increase goblet
cell numbers and thus mucin production, which in turn reduces gut permeability; and (c) why LTA from LpD3-5
differs in its mucin-promoting activity between two Lactobacillus paracasei (Lp) strains. To address these
important gaps in the current state of knowledge, in Aim 1, we will define the causative role of elevated gut
permeability on the onset and severity of cognitive decline/AD and its reversal by LpD3-5, using both normal
aging and AD (APP/PS1) mouse models. In Aim 2, we will determine whether LpD3-5 and its LTA promote
differentiation of iSCs into a goblet cell lineage in mice, to define the mechanism by which they increase goblet
cell numbers in older and AD gut. In Aim 3, we will examine strain-specific D-alanyl-modification on LTAs using
NMR structural analyses, to define the differences in their ability to promote mucin production via activating
TLR2/Muc2 axis in vitro. Outcomes of these studies are expected to provide, for the first time, direct evidence
that increased gut permeability due to loss of the mucus barrier accelerates both aging-related cognitive decline
and AD, and that a unique human-origin probiotic therapy can reverse them. This work could inform a new
paradigm to connect aging and AD by means of increased gut permeability as a common mechanism, and open
opportunities for rational design of synthetic mimetics of LTAs to reduce gut permeability, cognitive decline, and
AD – debilitating public health problems of older adults."
10795712,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
High-resolution imaging techniques are essential for investigation of the pathogenesis and development of
therapeutic and screening strategies for cerebral small vessel disease (SVD), including Alzheimer Disease (AD)
and AD-related dementias. Previous studies have demonstrated a link between retinal and cerebral
microvascular changes. Moreover, the accessibility of the retinal tissue for noninvasive imaging offers an
advantage for identifying microvascular dysfunction due to SVD. However, a significant gap remains in our
understanding how changes in the capillary networks in cortex and retina mirror each other during both normal
ageing and SVD progression. Filling the gap requires innovative technologies to measure absolute microvascular
oxygenation, perfusion, and morphology at subcapillary scale in both retina and cortex, applied to animal models
that recapitulate the clinical and histopathological features of microvasculopathy.
We propose to develop novel methods to investigate retinal O2 delivery and consumption with unprecedented
spatial resolution and to correlate changes that occur in parallel in retinal and cortical microvasculature during
normal ageing and AD. Aim 1 will develop and validate a multimodal two-photon fluorescence imaging method
for combined measurements of absolute oxygen tension (pO2) and blood flow in major retinal vessels and derive
global measurements of O2 metabolic rate. We will then investigate how normal aging affects microvascular
structure and function in cortical and retinal tissue. Aim 2 will develop and validate an adaptive optics two-photon
microscopy imaging method for pO2 in the retinal capillaries, coupled with imaging of capillary red blood cell
(RBC) flux using the previously established RBC passage method. High-resolution retinal tissue pO2 imaging
will also be developed, as well as a deep Differential Aberration imaging of pO2 in vasculature and tissue. Aim 3
will test the hypothesis that microvascular hemodynamic and tissue metabolic changes during early stages of
AD occur in parallel in retina and cerebral cortex. We will compare retinal and cortical microvascular oxygenation,
blood flow, and O2 metabolic rate in experimental mouse model of AD.
Development of novel methods to investigate retinal O2 delivery and consumption will advance our understanding
of the concurrent microvascular dysfunction in cortex and retina during both normal ageing and SVD progression,
provide broad utility in assessing retinal microvascular domains in animal models of eye disorders, and augment
knowledge of vascular mechanisms of progressive neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment in common
forms of SVD as well as in AD and related dementias."
10892758,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Agonists for dopamine D1–like receptors (D1R) consistently have been shown to enhance cognitive
functions (e.g., working memory) in normal, lesioned, and aged murine and primate species, including humans.
The D1R also plays important roles in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and cognitive process that are damaged
during age-related cognitive decline such as in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Receptor functional selectivity/biased
signaling is a useful approach for discovery of drugs with ability to activate differentially signaling pathways
mediated by a single receptor. Our recent work suggested D1 functional selectivity has critical influence in
modulation of working memory related behavior and neurophysiology in the prefrontal cortex of young adult rats.
These and other data suggested functionally selective D1 ligands could be promising candidates for age-related
cognitive decline. Here we propose a discovery project to understand how signaling bias affects the cognitive
effects of D1 ligands, and to target novel functionally selective D1 agonists that may become potential IND
candidates for the pharmacological treatment of age-related cognitive decline. This will be accomplished by the
following three iterative but also independent specific aims, using recent advances in three field, in vitro
pharmacology, in vivo behavioral and physiological neuroscience, and in silico ligand-target mechanistic studies.
Aim 1 will examine behavioral and neurophysiological changes manifested by differential activation of D1
signaling pathways in aged versus young rats (24-month elderly and 5-month young adult Fisher, TgF344
transgenic AD rats). Pre-selected D1 ligands will be tested by a working memory related delayed alteration
response task in the T-maze primarily, for their effects on behavior and neurophysiology. Aim 2 will use
computational methods for ligand-target simulation to develop mechanism and accelerate drug discovery. Aim
3 will complete a thoroughly pharmacological screen to elucidate optimal D1 signaling profiles for age-related
cognitive decline. This will involve characterization of receptor binding properties and functional assays, and off-
target analysis, in not only heterologous expression systems but also brain tissue. The successful completion of
proposed specific aims will provide heuristic information on the potential advantages of functionally selective D1
agonists for age-related cognitive decline. Recent clinical studies have shown, contrary to earlier views, that the
D1R is a druggable target. Thus, this project will provide a rational foundation for selection of novel candidates
for future IND-enabling studies and clinical trials."
10883907,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A heterozygous hexanucleotide (GGGGCC) repeat expansion in a single allele of the C9orf72 gene is the most
frequent known genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), two
fatal and irreversible neurodegenerative diseases. Given that there are no effective treatments for FTD (an
Alzheimer’s-related dementia) and ALS, novel therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Targeting the
C9orf72 gene itself by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing may provide a curative intervention. However, we need to
learn about the biology of the C9orf72 gene in order to employ gene editing strategies.
This work proposes novel applications of CRISPR gene editing technology to edit or silence the pathogenic
C9orf72 disease allele in FTD/ALS patient derived iPSC. With the completion of these aims, we will have
systematically evaluated three complementary methods for silencing a deleterious repeat expansion in the
C9orf72 gene: (1) bi-allelic excision of non-coding DNA harboring only the repeat expansion (Aim 1), (2) allele-
specific excision of the mutant allele containing the repeat expansion (Aim 1), (3) regulatory region disruption
to selectively silence the C9orf72 repeat expansion (Aim 3). We will examine the ability of these editing
strategies to correct disease pathology in cell types relevant to disease – human cortical and motor neurons.
We have developed fast and robust methods to generate neurons from human induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs) derived from controls and patients. Analysis of edited control cell lines will allow us to screen for
unanticipated effects of precise gene edits on normal cellular function and fitness. Our findings will not only
advance our understanding of potential therapeutic approaches, but will also inform our understanding C9orf72
biology, including C9orf72 gene regulation and potential mechanisms of disease. This and our future studies
will develop a pipeline for systematically evaluating editing strategies that are potentially curative."
10810841,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are among the most prevalent infections in humans worldwide. Decades
of studies using animal and cell culture models as well as ex vivo data have yielded considerable knowledge on
what causes these infections and how these infections proceed from the initial infection to disease outcomes.
The two most prevalent STIs, chlamydia and gonorrhea, are caused by Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria
gonorrhoeae. Although many virulence factors are well characterized for these two pathogens, much remains to
be known about their path toward causing pelvic inflammatory disease, tubal infertility and life-threatening ectopic
pregnancy. Limitations of existing model systems are highlighted by a poor understanding of the role of the
cervicovaginal microbiota in gonococcal susceptibility or resistance to infection and often conflicting available
information on how C. trachomatis may persist silently in a host without symptoms to only reappear sometimes
years later and cause severe disease. The proposed Biomimetics Cooperative Research Center “Structure,
Immunity, Microbiome: Human 3D Biomimetic Cervicovaginal Models for Sexually Transmitted Infections”
represents a pioneering effort by collaborating engineers and molecular microbiologists to develop a novel three-
dimensional biomimetic model of the human cervicovaginal mucosa amenable to the study of STIs caused by
C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae. The model faithfully reconstructs the target tissue of infection by these two
pathogens including an anoxic environment, cervicovaginal epithelial cells, the underlying stroma with
fibroblasts, and the vasculature lined by endothelial cells, through which immune cells can be delivered to the
infected tissue. SIM-STI will allow for the first time an evaluation of the role of the cervicovaginal microbiota, the
menstrual cycle and co-infection on chlamydial and gonococcal pathogenesis and host response to infection.
This inexpensive, easy to use biomimetic model holds the promise of resolving many questions of pathogenesis,
but also to serve as a preclinical platform for testing preventive and therapeutic strategies against STIs."
10912722,"Since 2007, we have annually tracked the dynamics of immune system changes with the Stanford Ellison
Longitudinal Aging (SELA) cohort, which consists of ~150 young (20-40) and old (60+) individuals of various
ages for which we determined cell subset phenotypes and cytokine responses at high resolution, whole blood
gene expression, serum cytokines, HAI response to annual flu vaccination, and a standardized clinical
evaluation. Given the length of time and the depth of profiling, the SELA cohort is a unique resource.
Using a novel systems approach which leverages the high-dimensional and longitudinal nature of the data
allowed us to gain increased insight into immune-aging and describe an individual’s immune baseline
homeostatic state as shifting slowly along a continuum and a trajectory, well beyond what can normally be
obtained from cross-sectional analyses. We utilized this to build a reliable metric of immune-age (IMM-AGE),
which captures a life-long process of change in immune cell subset composition and cell responses in a single
value. IMM-AGE only partially correlates with chronological age and yet has prognostic clinical value with respect
to all-cause-mortality in healthy older adults beyond well-established risk factors. In addition, using SELA we
have identified several strong links between cardiovascular disease and immune-based predictive markers,
correlative to IMM-AGE, that offer better and earlier detection than existing standard clinical tests. Understanding
human immune variation and aging through the lens of a quantitative patterned process led us to testable
hypotheses which we will explore here. Specifically, our two research projects address two questions – (1) what
drives immune-aging; and (2) how does it relate to immune response, disease severity, and treatment? To
answer these questions we will continue the longitudinal profiling of SELA, now with more epigenetic and
environmental data, and recruit additional cohorts: a healthy twin cohort (ages 40-60), a current gap in SELA
and one informative of early immune aging; a cohort of older adults vigorously exercising and living well which
can be leveraged to distinguish features of biological aging and those modifiable by lifestyle and for which we
have measured immune parameters in 2011; and two additional cohorts, first of heart transplant subjects and
second of subjects in the Women’s Health Initiative with retrospective information on cardiovascular state. These
latter cohorts will allow us to test hypotheses raised from our published studies on the relation of immune-aging
to cardiovascular disease and its connection to flu history, an observed epidemiological association whose
mechanism has been unclear to date. Last, we will use post-vaccination samples from SELA collected over 12+
years to map flu-specific B and T cell response history and test whether this information, coupled with immune-
age, can help predict flu vaccine responses in older adults, a currently unsolved problem with major clinical
implications. Insights of this work will lead to refinement of the metric, its connection to human physiology, and
provide a means to assess how immune-aging plays a role in the chronic and acute age associated conditions."
10868670,"Pathogenesis of E. coli and Shigella Infections in Human Enteroid Models
 Overall Description / Summary
 This first renewal of a funded program Project Grant (PPG) is to continue progress in understanding the
pathophysiology and identification of ways to interfere with diarrhea caused by Shigella and two pathotypes of
diarrheagenic E. coli (enteroaggregative and enterotoxigenic E. coli). The substantial progress made has
resulted from the close collaboration and combined expertise of investigators from the University of Maryland,
Johns Hopkins University and the University of Virginia who are using shared models of normal human enteroid
and colonoid monolayers exposed to enteric bacterial pathogens as well as human enteroid monolayers co-
cultured with innate phagocytic cells present in the intestine. The group of investigators has internationally
renowned experience in enteric diseases, as well as in microbiology, gastroenterology, molecular physiology,
pediatric infectious diseases, cell biology, molecular pathogenesis, and mucosal immunology. This consortium
has interacted and in a superbly collaborative manner sharing technical and scientific information through formal
monthly face-to-face or Zoom-based meetings, frequent telephone or electronic communication and visits to
laboratories, with the latter being the standard form of interaction of the U Maryland and JHU investigators. The
Enteroid and Immunology Cores have developed new tools and methods that were rapidly transferred to the
Project investigators, resulting in a significant number of collaborative publications from the PPG. As expected,
progress was stepwise with transfer of methodology and reagents for propagating the enteroids, production of
monolayers, development of the bacterial-enteroid models, and development of co-cultures with immune cells
leading to new insights in the pathogen-enteroid interactions. The overall goal of the PPG remains to increase
understanding of the pathophysiology and potential treatments of these three important pathogens. The
proposed studies will continue to use normal human enteroids or colonoids, grown on monolayers, and extend
this through co-culture to make the model more closely resemble human intestine. This will be accomplished by
expanding the co-culture models to a) establish monolayers in a 3D scaffold matrix to facilitate epithelial-immune
cell interaction and immune cell movement; b) incorporate macrophages, neutrophils and dendritic cells as well
as to develop a new co-culture system that includes intraepithelial γδ +T lymphocytes (IEL); c) apply an enriched
M cell model; d) expose the co-culture model to flow-based shear stress as occurs normally in the intestine; e)
determine the contribution of an anaerobic environment. As during the past funding period, examination of
pathophysiologic aspects common to the diseases studied will serve to integrate the projects. In addition to
pathogen specific pathophysiologic aspects, these include the role of mucins, bacterial proteases called
SPATES, enterotoxins, secreted cytokines and involvement of co-cultured innate immune cells."
10884104,"Project Summary
Alzheimer's Disease is a devastating disease marked by cognitive decline. The reasons underlying this decline
are still unclear, but it is known that Amyloid β (Aβ) aggregation and accumulation in the brain contributes to
worsening cognitive deficits. Recently, it has been identified that major mediators of bulk fluid flow in the brain
are implicated in the clearing of Amyloid β, including the glymphatic system, the meningeal lymphatics, and the
blood vasculature. Decreased fluid flow via any of these routes can worsen accumulation of Aβ and cognitive
deficits in murine models of the disease. Bulk pathways are important for understanding overall clearance from
the brain, however, it does not give us insight into the underlying cellular or tissue-level mechanisms. Interstitial
fluid flow is the flow within tissue around the cells, interacting with each cell surface. These interactions can result
in downstream changes to cell signaling inducing activation, inflammatory cascades, and cellular migration. In
brain cancer, increased interstitial fluid flow develops due to the increase in interstitial pressure in the tumor bulk
interfacing with the relatively normal pressure of the surrounding brain tissue, or tumor microenvironment. In our
prior grant, we focused on this increased interstitial flow in brain cancer to identify the mechanisms underlying
this flow-mediated invasion. To examine how interstitial fluid flow affects the invasion of brain cancer cells, we
have developed in vitro and in vivo methods to examine fluid flow responses including multicellular in vitro tissue
engineered systems and in vivo imaging methods. In AD, though flow may be decreasing, the same molecules
and mechanisms may be involved due to their flow sensitivity. Thus, in this application, we will conduct direct in
vivo measurements of interstitial flow using intravital imaging in mouse models of AD. Using this information we
will build our in vitro models of the neuro-glial microenvironment with human and mouse healthy and AD-affected
cells to identify the role of IFF in secretion, accumulation, and patterning of Aβ as well as the effect of different
types of Aβ and IFF on cellular health. Last, we will determine the role of a unique molecule identified in cancer
but expressed on astrocytes and microglia, S1PR3, in mediating the AD phenotype and determine if there is
benefit to therapeutically agonizing or antagonizing this receptor to mitigate cognitive deficits. Altogether, these
reports will advance the importance and strategies for mitigating interstitial flow and its effects in Alzheimer's
Disease and offer modalities by which to study further effects of flow at the cellular level. Understanding the
impact of interstitial flow may ultimately help predict, diagnose, and treat Alzheimer's Disease."
10795713,"PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT)
An athletic career filled with head impacts (HI) predisposes athletes to memory impairments and is a
risk factor for dementias including Alzheimer’s disease. While proteinopathy is clearly linked to brain
dysfunction in the late stages of these disease, memory problems are also a common symptom in
reported cases with early-stage disease – and even those cases with no neurodegenerative disease
pathology. To understand the nature of the chronic memory impairments caused by HI, we are focused
on the physiological changes that occur in the brain after exposure to a high frequency of non-damaging
HI (HFHI), and comparing our results to a single severe single TBI. Our preliminary data shows that
exposing mice to HFHI causes an adaptive response in excitatory synapses. These adaptations occur
at the cost of normal brain function, with widespread and prolonged impairments in learning and
memory. This synaptic dampening is permanent, and does not spontaneously reverse. In this proposal
we aim to determine if we can reverse chronic synaptic dysfunction in the injured brain, and recall a
forgotten memory.
In this proposal we will test the hypothesis that HFHI disrupts synaptic transmission within the
memory circuits of the hippocampus, and that activation of engram neurons can override these
cognitive deficits and reanimate a forgotten memory.
These data will allow us to test if it will be possible to treat cognitive impairments by targeting the
synapse in different types of TBI. This will have profound implications for the millions of people living
with cognitive and behavioral dysfunction after head impact, and could be harnessed to reduce the
number of TBI patients that progress to develop Alzheimer’s disease each year."

 Periodontitis is a highly prevalent oral disease among US adults and is the primary cause of the loss of
permanent teeth. It was recently estimated that 42% of US adults aged 30 years or older have periodontitis, with
7.8% having severe periodontitis. Destructive periodontitis is characterized by the loss of dental supporting
tissues including alveolar bone. Clinically, alveolar bone loss can be broadly divided into vertical (intrabony) and
horizontal (suprabony) bone loss. Surprisingly, horizontal bone loss in periodontitis is the most common problem
confronting clinicians but has received scant attention. Currently, there are no products offering satisfactory
outcomes for the treatment of horizontal alveolar bone loss. Therefore, it is clinical significance to develop
innovative biomaterials and technology for horizontal alveolar bone regeneration. In the preliminary studies, a
multifunctional injectable nanofibrous ECM-mimicking microsphere (MINE-MS) system with several unique
features was designed and fabricated. These features include high mechanical strength, excellent injectability
and cytocompatibility, fast setting time, strong antibacterial activity, and high osteoinductivity. In addition, a short
peptide E7 that has high specific affinity to bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and repels
epithelial and gingival fibroblast cells was identified. When the E7 peptide was conjugated to the MINE-MS
surface, the MINE-MS served as an excellent biological barrier to selectively repopulate cells by significantly
increasing BMSCs and expelling epithelia and fibroblasts both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the pilot
experiment shows that the MINE-MS successfully elevated the alveolar crest and regenerated more bone than
enamel matrix derivative (a clinical product for periodontitis treatment) in a mouse periodontitis-induced
horizontal bone loss model. These exciting findings make the MINE-MS an excellent candidate for the treatment
of horizontal alveolar bone loss in periodontitis. The proposed project, therefore, is to develop and optimize the
MINE-MS system for horizontal alveolar bone regeneration. Three specific aims are proposed in this work. Aim
1 is to synthesize the MINE-MS and optimize the properties, including the injectability, setting time, mechanical
strength, cytocompatibility, and antibacterial activity. Aim 2 focuses on incorporating the BMSC affinity peptide
onto the MINE-MS surface, evaluating and optimizing its function as a biological barrier for selective cell
repopulation using a competitive cell adhesion assay in vitro and a periodontal fenestration defect rat model. In
Aim 3, an osteogenic peptide-loaded nanospheres will be incorporated into the core of the MINE-MS and its
function for enhanced bone regeneration will be examined. Lastly, the optimized MINE-MS will be tested for
periodontal alveolar bone regeneration in a rat periodontitis-induced horizontal bone loss model. Successful
completion of this project will address the challenge of periodontitis-induced horizontal alveolar bone loss,
making a significant step towards periodontal alveolar bone regeneration in clinic."

As a Children's Health Exposure Analysis Resource (CHEAR) Hub, we have established comprehensive
untargeted methods for detection, annotation, and identification of signals derived from endogenous
compounds, environmentally relevant chemicals, drugs and medications, and ingestion of foods. We use
several systems for Untargeted Analysis, including Liquid Chromatography (LC) coupled to High-Resolution
Orbitrap and Time of Flight (TOF) Mass Spectrometry (MS) systems, and Gas Chromatography (GC) coupled
to TOF MS. Under an Institutional commitment are also installing a GC-Q-Exactive High-Resolution MS system.
We are confident that we can capture tens of thousands of signals, and identify a diverse range of endogenous
compounds (e.g., amino acids, amines, carboxylic acids, sugars, acylcarnitines, nucleosides, fatty acids, and
lysophospholipids), environmentally relevant compounds (e.g., metabolites from alkyl phosphate pesticides,
phthalates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, volatile organic compounds, perfluoro compounds, metabolites
of tobacco products, environmental phenols, and parabens), metabolites produced by the ingestion of food
(e.g., polyphenols and their metabolites), medications (e.g. acetaminophen, sulfaguanidine, metformin), and
drugs of abuse (e.g., heroin, morphine, opioids, and their metabolites). We also use Lipidomics, UPLC-Ion
Mobility-MS, LC-electrochemical detection (ECD), NMR, and GC- and LC- multiple reaction monitoring methods
to capture signals for analytes that are difficult to detect and identify using untargeted platforms. Using our
methods, we have had outstanding performance in the NIH Common Fund Metabolomics Program Ring Trial,
and in the CHEAR Cross Laboratory Comparison. We will continue to expand the identifications of signals on
the untargeted platforms through using a) Big Data analytics for annotation of signals, followed by confirmation
with standards, b) ensuring that signals are annotated in respect to the metabolic fate of the environmental
compounds, and c) collaborating with the Development Core (DC), and HHEAR program to further develop
broad spectrum methods and panels for analytes not detected using untargeted methods. We use an Ontology
System developed by our laboratory that provides the evidence basis for all signal annotations and metabolite
identifications, ensuring optimal communications of our results to the client, the data analysis center, and data
repositories. Our core uses statistical analysis and modelling approaches to determine metabolites that
distinguish study phenotypes, and to reveal the associations between environmentally relevant chemicals,
endogenous metabotypes, and health phenotypes."

10899694,"Project Summary:
The proposed University of Utah Cooperative Centers of Excellence in Hematology (CCEH) brings together 38
investigators whose research activities are focused on various aspects of iron and heme metabolism and non-
malignant hematology. Iron plays an essential role in many biological processes including heme synthesis,
oxygen transport, cellular respiration and DNA synthesis. Malregulation of iron homeostasis, either from
deficiency or excess, results in disease. Heme is a key component of hemoglobin and other hemoproteins, but
heme also plays a regulatory role in a number of metabolic pathways. Disorders of heme biosynthesis are
responsible for an important group of human diseases, namely the porphyrias. The Utah Center for Iron and
Heme Disorders (CIHD) will support the activities of a Research Base of 38 investigators whose research
projects focus on the roles of iron, porphyrins and heme in eukaryotic metabolism. The activities of center
members encompass both basic and clinical studies designed to identify disease mechanisms. To accomplish
our goals, we propose an Administrative Core and four Biomedical Research Cores. The majority of the cores
are already present and have been adjusted to meet the needs of the CIHD. These include: an Iron and Heme
Core, which can assay and quantitate metals, porphyrins, heme biosynthetic enzymes and iron-binding and
other proteins; a Metabolomics Core, which provides metabolomic phenotyping and molecular identification; a
Mutation Generation and Detection Core, which provides cutting edge genome editing through CRISPR and
TALEN reagents; and a new core in this renewal, the Protein-Metabolite Interactomics Core that provides
proteomics services but adds the unique technology of identification of metabolites that interact with a protein
and may post-translationally modify the protein in novel ways. The services provided by these cores will enable
individual investigators to: 1) identify the role of genes in hematopoiesis or iron overload; 2) determine the
effects of gene modification or mutations on metabolism in cultured cells or biological fluids; and 3) identify at
the biochemical level the effect of mutations or conditions that affect iron and heme homeostasis on all levels.
The Administrative Core will provide budgetary and scientific guidance to CIHD activities. Core recharge fees
will be used to enhance and expand core operations. An Enrichment Program is designed for trainees and
young investigators in the fields of nonmalignant hematology and for senior investigators who wish to enter this
field. The Research Base is drawn from both the University of Utah and other institutions, with half of the
members belonging to institutions outside of Utah. We have increased the Research base from 22 to 38 with
the addition of ~4 investigators each year. The goals of the CIHD are to be a national resource for studies
involving iron and heme and to inspire the next generation of investigators focused on iron, heme and
nonmalignant hematology."

A fundamental gap in our knowledge of the nervous system is understanding how variations in wiring and
connectivity of neuronal circuits relate to variability in neural computations and behavior. This gap has arisen
because anatomical connectivity and function are typically studied separately. Here, we will assemble a team of
researchers with complementary skills to tackle this problem. We will combine several technologies developed
in our labs, including in vivo calcium imaging during behavior to study neuronal population activity during
perceptually-guided behaviors and high-throughput electron microscopy (EM) to extract the connectivity of an
underlying network essential for that behavior. To do so, we will use Drosophila melanogaster as a model system
because it has a powerful genetic toolkit, tractable number of neurons, is amenable to large-scale behavioral
screens, and is a realistic target for comparative whole-brain connectomics. This makes the fly an excellent
model to develop a comprehensive approach to characterize neuronal circuits.
We will apply our new approach to investigate how population codes, network connectivity, and structure-function
relationships differ between individuals. Although it is well known that individuals, as well as males and females,
exhibit variable behaviors, little is understood about how variations in neuronal wiring and connectivity relate to
variations in neural computation and ultimately behavior. In our first aim, we will compare population codes,
wiring, and connectivity between multiple isogenic individuals that exhibit differences in visually-guided approach
behavior. In a second aim, we will apply similar approaches to investigate differences in odor preference
behavior. We will test how stochastic brain asymmetry, weighting of sensory signals, and repertoire of local
interneurons influence computations within individual brains. Analyzing structure-function relationships across
individuals will examine the tradeoff between neuronal circuit precision and variability, and reveal how specific
variations shape information processing and behavior. We will generate models predicting neuronal function and
behavior from circuit wiring and neuronal structure. Our work will be among the first to compare whole-brain,
synaptic-resolution connectomes of multiple individuals to reveal fundamental constraints on functional network
organization and discover how circuit variability supports individuality."
10427189,"Background: Reducing suicide and suicide attempts among U.S. Veterans is a major national priority, as
more than 6,000 Veterans die by suicide every year and many more attempt suicide. In 2017, the most recent
year for which data are available, the suicide rate among Veterans was 1.5 times the rate of non-Veterans, and
the suicide rate among female Veterans was 2.2 times the rate of non-Veteran females. Current VHA suicide
risk prediction models suffer from high numbers of false negatives - Veterans not deemed at high risk of
suicide who do attempt or die by suicide. These suicide prediction models have not incorporated the rich
information from clinical progress notes that may improve our ability to predict suicidal behavior. Much of this
information in clinical progress notes is unstructured free text. A suicide-specific ontology and information
extraction system that can extract suicide-related information from unstructured clinical progress notes is not
available.
Significance/Impact: Enhancing VHA's ability to identify Veterans who are most likely to attempt suicide
ensures that limited intervention resources can be focused on Veterans with the highest risk, before they
attempt suicide or die by suicide. The proposed study is well-aligned with priorities for HSR&D research and
with VA strategic goals for 2018 – 2024 set out by VA leadership, who listed suicide prevention as “VA's
highest clinical priority.”
Innovation: Our key methodological innovation is to pair a state-of-the-art theoretical framework (3-step
Theory of Suicide) to predict who is most likely to act on their suicidal thoughts with state-of-the-art data
science methods (NLP, machine learning). Since our suicide-theory concepts, that is hopelessness,
connectedness, psychological pain, and capacity for suicide, are not represented in structured patient data, we
will develop novel NLP and information extraction tools and apply them to clinical progress notes, the potential
of which has not been fully levied to improve suicide prediction models.
Specific Aims: We have three specific aims:
 1. Develop a suicide-specific ontology for machine recognition of hopelessness, connectedness,
 psychological pain, and capacity for suicide in progress notes of clinical encounters with Veterans who
 attempted or died by suicide.
 2. Extract information on the presence and intensity of hopelessness, connectedness, psychological pain,
 and capacity for suicide in clinical progress notes and describe change in these concepts in proximity of
 a suicide or suicide attempt.
 3. Determine the predictive validity of hopelessness, connectedness, psychological pain, and capacity for
 suicide regarding Veteran suicide attempts and mortality in two prediction models that VA currently
 uses in clinical practice: STORM and REACHVET.
Methodology: The proposed mixed-methods study has an exploratory sequential design where a qualitative
component (Aim 1) informs quantitative analyses (Aims 2 and 3). Data collection will be from existing clinical
progress notes in VHA's Corporate Data Warehouse, VA's Suicide Prevention Applications Network and from
the VA/DoD Suicide Data Repository. We will use linguistic annotation and thematic analysis for Aim 1 and
natural language processing and machine learning models for Aims 2 and 3. The target population is Veterans
who receive care through VHA.
Next Steps/Implementation: Our most important next step is to be in regular contact with local and national
colleagues at the VA Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention (OMHSP) to facilitate implementation of
our results in the operational versions of STORM and REACHVET."

Here, we propose to thoroughly characterize the origins of pairwise correlations in cortex using a synergistic mix
of experimental methodologies, behavior, and computation in mice and macaques. We will elucidate the
mechanistic underpinnings of normalization and test our hypothesis that changes in cortical pairwise correlations
and other signature arise from ongoing cortical computations. In Aim 1 we will record from populations of neurons
in the middle temporal visual area of trained, behaving monkeys to test the hypothesis that pairwise spike
correlations, gamma oscillation and transient responses at the onset of visual stimuli arise in part from the
dynamics of the circuits that normalize neuronal responses. These tests require measurements with a precision
that is not feasible in mice. Conversely, the experiments in Aim 2 and 3 address questions that are not feasible
in monkeys. In Aim 2 we will exploit the accessibility of mouse visual cortex by using both two-photon laser
scanning microscopy and multielectrode arrays to comprehensively measure the relationship between
normalization and pairwise correlations in populations of V1 neurons and measure how spatial separation within
cerebral cortex affects that relationship. Finally, in Aim 3 we will establish the contributions of specific cell classes
to normalization and pairwise correlations in mouse V1. We record the activity of pyramidal neurons and the
three most thoroughly characterized classes of cortical interneuron (VIP, SST and PV) during normalization. We
will then separately manipulate the activity of these cells classes to revealing the role that changes to the ratio
of excitation and inhibition play in driving normalization. In this way, we will establish the role these neurons play
in changing pairwise correlations within the excitatory pool of neurons. Results from all three Aims will be tied
together using a new family of dynamic, recurrent circuit models of normalization to formalize the hypothesis that
normalization imposes pairwise correlations and other activity signatures, and will use experimental data to
constrain and refine these models."
10927364,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Mississippi has some of the nation's worst health outcomes and was ranked by the
United Health Foundation as the “least healthy state” in 2019. Further, the racial disparities surrounding these
health outcomes are profound. The complexities associated with effectively addressing Mississippians' health
outcomes and ameliorating Mississippi's health disparities necessitate a strong, multi-disciplinary research and
outreach infrastructure. The Mississippi Center for Clinical and Translational Research (MCCTR) was
established in 2016 to provide this infrastructure, equipping researchers with the resources needed to conduct
clinical, translational, and population-based research projects. The MCCTR proposes to continue and expand
its efforts through what it has termed as “Phase II.” In Phase II, the MCCTR will add two new institutional partners,
Mississippi State University and University of Mississippi-Oxford, to its Phase I partners, University of Mississippi
Medical Center, Tougaloo College, and University of Southern Mississippi. It will also add two CTR/CTSAs as
collaborating partners, the University of Alabama at Birmingham's Center for Clinical and Translational Science
and the Northwestern University Clinical and Translational Sciences, to its Phase I partners: Mayo Clinic's Center
for Clinical and Translational Science and the Louisiana Clinical and Translational Science Center.
 The Administrative Core will be responsible for managing the administrative, fiscal, and scientific aspects of
the MCCTR, including the oversight, marketing, and coordination of all MCCTR cores and activities. The
Professional Development Core will offer structured mentorship, training opportunities, and protected research
time for early stage investigators at MCCTR partner institutions. The Community Engagement and Outreach
Core will provide training and support to investigators in conducting community engaged research; partner with
healthcare providers through its new Practice-Based Research Network; and work with its expanded Community
Advisory Board to provide bi-directional communication and guidance on community values, concerns, and
needs and represent the MCCTR to Mississippi Communities. The Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Research
Design Core will provide training and assistance with research design, data collection and management, and
statistical analysis to increase the effectiveness, efficiency, and success of research conducted by MCCTR
investigators. The Pilot Projects Program will support clinical, translational, and population-based research
projects likely to have a meaningful impact on Mississippi health outcomes and lead to extramural funding. The
Research Services Core will support research projects through study coordination and regulatory support and
will help connect researchers to communities through expanded telehealth and cohort-study resources. Finally,
the Tracking and Evaluation Core will provide accurate and timely information on MCCTR performance and
impact to inform planning and implementation by leadership and advisory bodies. Through the infrastructure of
resources and personnel developed by MCCTR, Mississippi's health outcomes will be positively impacted."
10928195,"Native American communities in Montana experience severe health disparities, including mental health
diseases that result in an all-cause death rate that is 58% higher than the white rate. Funding of Blackfeet
Community College (BCC) by a previous NARCH grant produced research results that indicate the degree of
connection of Blackfeet community members to Blackfeet community and culture positively affects their health
(1). In light of these findings, the overarching goal of the current Blackfeet NARCH application is to
improve the mental and physical health of the Blackfeet Nation by the development of the BCC Center
for Culture as Medicine (CCM). We believe investing in developing Native researchers as well as research
infrastructure at BCC can have a significant and lasting effect on the health prospects of future generations of
Blackfeet people. Identifying the sources and causes of reservation health disparities and reducing or
eliminating those causes through research, mitigation, remediation, and public education can have significant
impact on health. The proposed project leverages the previous NARCH efforts over the last several years to
train BCC faculty in biomedical research and to build the college’s research infrastructure, including a state-of-
the art research laboratory at BCC that has enabled our students and faculty to perform a broad range of
research projects. Importantly, the previous funding began to develop a research culture at BCC and the
Blackfeet community. In this proposal, we utilize this developing research culture and our previous results to
inform a proposed intervention, further develop the research interest in BCC students and faculty, explore new
traditional approaches to improve health, and develop a sustainable BCC-CCM.
 In order to accomplish the goals of improving the health of the Blackfeet Nation and to develop the BCC-
CCM, we propose to achieve the following specific aims: 1. perform interventions informed by our previous
research to improve the physical and mental health of the Blackfeet Nation. 2. generate new results
that will inform future interventions that will respond to health concerns among the Blackfeet Nation. 3.
build the capacity of health equity research at BCC by developing a sustainable BCC-CCM. These aims
will be accomplished through the proposed BCC-CCM, Administrative Core, a student and faculty research
development project, an intervention based on enhancing connection of reservation participants to community
and culture to improve physical and mental health, and a pilot project to explore how the Piikani language can
positively affect health."
10832586,"ABSTRACT
Unless COVID overtakes it, tuberculosis is likely to keep its grip on its grim record of being the leading
infectious cause of human death. Humans are the only known natural host and transmitting reservoir for the
causative agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). This means that person-to-person transmission through air
is essential for Mtb's survival as a species. Despite multifaceted efforts to reduce TB's transmissibility, TB's
reproductive number, Ro, remains among the highest of frequently-lethal infectious diseases. Aerogenic
transmission is a stage in Mtb's life cycle that must have been subjected to strong evolutionary pressures, yet
our knowledge of Mtb's transmission biology is sorely lacking. The problem has been nearly inaccessible to
basic-science study for want of suitable technologies and animal models. This Program Project proposes to lay
a basic-science foundation for potential new transmission blocking interventions by bringing a synergistic
combination of investigators and disciplines together for a collaborative attack that mobilizes genome-wide
screening under transmission-relevant conditions, characterizes Mtb's metabolomic, lipidomic and biochemical
responses to those conditions, introduces and improves animal models, and uses aerosol physics as a guide
and tool. Project 1 will identify genes that Mtb requires to survive the transitions between major states that the
pathogen encounters en route to, during and after aerosol transmission. Project 2 will identify conserved,
essential metabolic programs in Mtb that have evolved in response to transmission-related stresses, such as
changes in humidity and gas composition. Project 3 builds on the recent discovery of cough-inducing lipids
produced by Mtb to characterize an even more potent tussive lipid as a virulence factor and to develop a model
of cough-based transmission among guinea pigs. Project 4 characterizes the physical and rheological
properties of respiratory fluids relevant to TB transmission and uses that information to control the mechanical
generation of physiologically relevant, respirable aerosols of Mtb. Core A ensures the efficient flow of
information, personnel and materiel among these interconnected units, while Core B develops a mouse model
of simulated transmission using the aerosolization device and settings of Project 4 and applies that model to
confirm which genes Mtb depends on to survive aerosol transmission to a new host."
10795720,"Project Summary / Abstract
This grant focuses on how very recent experiences––over the past few seconds to minutes––allow brains to
update expectations about the world and then use these expectations to guide behavior. The ability to flexibly
adjust one's course of action in this manner is a hallmark of adaptive human behavior. At the neural level,
relevant cellular-activity correlates have been described in non-human primates and other vertebrate model
systems. For example, ramping neural activity has been observed in the few hundred milliseconds, or seconds,
leading up to behavioral decisions and the rate of rise of these ramps tracks the gradual accumulation of
information relevant for the decision being made. Ramping activity is thus a correlate of an increasing
expectation that an important decision needs to be made and the moment at which the ramp reaches a
threshold level typically signifies when a final decision is taken. Another salient correlate of internal
expectations are reward-prediction error signals: bursts of dopamine-neuron activity when an animal receives
an unexpected reward or a reward is surprisingly omitted. Reward-prediction error signals seem well poised to
adjust animal and human behavior based on learned expectations. A clearer picture of how quantitative
internal signals––like ramping and reward-prediction error activity––contribute to behavioral flexibility would be
an important step forward for cognitive neuroscience. Here, we propose to develop two new behavioral tasks in
tethered Drosophila, where we can perform simultaneous neurophysiology. Our first aim is to use one of these
tasks to test the hypothesis that ramping neural signals are fundamental in forming behavioral decisions over
tens-of-seconds to minutes timescales in ethologically relevant contexts, rather than just on much shorter
timescales and in laboratory defined tasks (as has been shown to date). Such a discovery would argue that
expectations built over minutes in real-world conditions are ultimately fed into slowly ramping neuronal signals
so as to guide natural decision-making. Our second aim is to discover reward-prediction error signals in fruit
flies actively performing a trial-by-trial conditioning task and to define a circuit mechanism through which such
signals allow brains to form quantitatively precise expectations––updated on a trial-by-trial basis––on the
likelihood of rewards arriving or not arriving in the near future. Such discoveries in a genetically tractable model
will inform our thinking on how our brains generate expectations that allow for flexible, adaptive behaviors,
ultimately informing new therapeutic approaches to neurological conditions in which flexibility is impaired, such
as obsessive-compulsive disorder."

Vision plays a key role in our ability to navigate through the environment, from identifying landmarks and obstacles
to determining location and heading. While studies of visual cortex have provided an understanding of properties
such as orientation selectivity and object recognition, much less is known about how cortical circuitry extracts
and processes features from the visual scene to support navigation. In particular, there are two challenges. First,
the nature of the visual stimulus is dramatically different in navigation, where the subject's movement through
the world creates a complex and dynamic visual input, in contrast to standard synthetic stimuli presented to
stationary subjects. Second, the types of visual features and computations that must be performed are different
in navigation than in standard detection or discrimination paradigms. Our goal in this proposal is to determine
how the brain extracts relevant visual features from the rich, dynamic visual input that typiﬁes active exploration,
and investigate how the neural representation of these features can support visual navigation.
 We will investigate this through three parallel aims, that build up from the representation of the visual scene
in V1 during freely moving navigation, to the computation of speciﬁc variables needed for navigation. In our ﬁrst
aim, we will measure the visual input in freely moving mice using miniature head-mounted cameras, together with
neural activity in V1, to determine how neural dynamics represent the visual scene during natural navigation. In
our second aim, we will use large ﬁeld-of-view two-photon imaging of multiple cortical areas, while mice navigate
in a naturalistic open-world virtual reality system, to determine how visual features are represented across visual
cortical areas. In our third aim, we will use 2-photon imaging in mice in a rotational arena to determine how visual
input is used to dynamically update a key navigational variable: heading direction. Together, this project bridges
foundational measurements in freely moving animals with mechanistic circuit investigations, to provide insights
into an important aspect of visual system function."
10493093,"Background: The transition to a skilled nursing facility (SNF) after an acute hospitalization is one of the most
perilous times in the life of an older Veteran. Veterans undergo more than 250,000 transitions between
hospitals and SNFs annually, but more than 1 in 4 is readmitted to the hospital from SNF and less than half
have returned to the community by 100 days following hospital discharge. Although the intent of SNF care is
to allow recuperation and rehabilitation, Veterans who do not successfully recover are commonly placed in
institutional long-term care at significant cost to themselves and to the VA, which spends more than $7 billion
annually on this care. However, SNFs vary widely in their rates of community discharge and costs of care
delivered. It is unclear how to identify “high-value” SNFs (those that deliver the best community discharge rates
at lowest cost) for Veterans since existing public quality metrics do not include VA SNFs, do not list Veteran-
specific outcomes, and do not include costs. Similarly, it is unclear how much matching individual Veteran
needs with particular SNF characteristics might improve value. The VA as both payer and provider of SNF
care has the unique opportunity to develop an optimal SNF network to drive high-value care.
Significance/Impact: This work aligns with VA priorities to develop an integrated, high-performing network for
Veterans as part of the MISSION Act and positions the VA as a leader in delivery of post-acute care. There
are more than 4 million Veterans currently over age 65, making it imperative to improve outcomes and lower
costs in SNFs as more Veterans transition out of the hospital to this care setting.
Innovation: The approach uses novel data sets and methods drawn from health economics, big data, and
systems engineering to provide new insights. To our knowledge, there are no published studies describing the
outcomes of Veterans in post-acute care, identifying characteristics of high-performing facilities, nor
establishing how matching patient to post-acute care provider characteristics affects outcomes.
Specific Aims: Our Specific Aims are to:
 1) Compare outcomes (successful discharge to the community) and costs (Federal dollars) across the
 population of Veterans discharged from a VA hospital to the three most common post-acute care
 settings where Veterans receive SNF care: CLCs, CNHs, and non-VA SNFs.
 2) Evaluate the effect of matching individual subpopulations of Veterans (e.g., by risk for adverse
 outcome) to SNF type (CLCs, CNHs, or non-VA SNFs) and SNF star rating on outcomes and costs.
 3) Compare the effects of consolidating SNF referrals to the SNF type with best outcomes and lowest
 costs (Aim 1) or matching individual Veteran characteristics to different SNFs (Aim 2) on Veteran
 outcomes, overall costs of care, and SNF capacity.
Methodology: This proposal uses advanced statistical techniques (such as instrumental variable and machine
learning methods) and a unique dataset (the 2014-18 Residential History File, which concatenates VA, fee-
basis, Medicare, and Medicaid data into longitudinal episodes of care for individual Veterans) to accomplish
our Aims.
Implementation/Next Steps: The results of this work will be disseminated to VA Geriatrics and Extended
Care and Office of Community Care leadership, who have been involved in the development of the proposal,
as well as VISN and VA facility leadership through two tools that can be used 1) at the bedside to optimize
SNF choice and 2) at a leadership level to help shape the SNF network to maximize value."

Tauopathies consist of a group of diseases, including frontotemporal dementias and the most common form
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and are characterized by the accumulation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles
(NFTs) composed of aggregates of hyperphosphorylated Tau protein and extensive neurodegeneration.
Accumulating evidence has implicated impaired autophagy-lysosomal pathway in neurodegenerative diseases
including AD. The Transcription Factor EB (TFEB) was discovered as a master regulator of intracellular
clearance that functions by cytoplasm-to-nucleus translocation, where it mediates coordinated expression of
autophagy and lysosomal target genes. Our studies in the current grant cycle revealed a multi-cellular role of
TFEB in addressing the Tau/NFT pathology. Specifically neuronal TFEB is highly efficacious in ameliorating
Tau/NFT pathology and rescue of cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration, whereas astroglial TFEB
prevents Tau pathological spreading in tauopathy mouse models. Significantly, we found that TFEB targets
only the aberrant Tau species while leaving the normal Tau intact, indicating that pathological Tau serves as
an upstream activator of TFEB. Supporting this premise, RNA-sequencing analysis of human AD brains and
Tau transgenic mice both revealed significant upregulation of TFEB and its lysosomal targets, in particular
multiple subunits of the V-ATPase critical for lysosomal acidification and function, thus documenting a
conserved TFEB/V-ATPase-mediated lysosomal response to disease pathology. Further, we identified a small
molecule lysosomal lipid signaling molecule that promotes TFEB nuclear localization in an mTOR-independent
manner. The overarching goal of this project is to investigate Tau-induced TFEB signaling pathway regulating
lysosomal homeostasis in physiological and tauopathy conditions and to identify strategies that target this
pathway for enhanced Tau clearance. Specifically, through unbiased proteomics analysis, we will determine
how Tau pathology induces unique TFEB post-translational modifications and nuclear signaling and we will test
their effect on Tau degradation. We will examine a novel nuclear export mechanism in mediating mTOR-
independent TFEB activity. Build on our exciting finding that TFEB/V-ATPase-mediated lysosomal signaling
pathway plays an essential role in regulating astrocyte and microglia response to neuronal Tau pathology, we
will interrogate the molecular mechanisms and functional consequences of this lysosome-immune system
relationship. Overall we will achieve deep understanding on how lysosomal function is regulated through
lysosome-to-nucleus signaling pathways, how these pathways are changed in AD and tauopathy conditions,
and how to harness these regulatory pathways for therapeutic intervention."

The plight of the neuroscientist trying to understand the brain using linear analysis methods is akin to studying
the makeup of the ocean using the bits you find with a metal detector. Everything we know about the neural
basis of decision making, from biology to computation to behavior, makes it clear that the relationship between
neurons and behavior is profoundly nonlinear. However, for good mathematical reasons, our attempts to
understand that relationship typically rely only on linear measures. These measures have an especially hard
time dealing with the reality that neural networks are far from static. Indeed, the flexibility of interactions between
neurons, while adding an additional nonlinearity, is a critically important clue about underlying mechanisms and
computations. The goal of the proposed project is to test the hypothesis that nonlinear measures of correlated
variability in a population of neurons will 1) establish a strong link between neurons and perceptual decisions, 2)
constrain models of the circuit mechanisms by which cognition affects perception, and 3) predict the effects of
causally manipulating different subtypes of inhibitory interneurons on population activity. We will use and
develop methods from algebraic topology to characterize the activity of neuronal populations in a holistic,
nonlinear way. Our project leverages the complementary strengths between three highly interactive approaches:
primate neurophysiology and psychophysics, modeling neuronal circuits, and two photon imaging and
optogenetic manipulation of subtypes of inhibitory interneurons in mice. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that
sensory and cognitive processes including contrast, adaptation, attention, and motivation affect performance on
visual tasks exactly when they change the topological signatures of the correlated variability in visual or parietal
cortex. In Aim 2, we will use a biophysically realistic model to understand which changes in a cortical circuit
would or would not change the topological signatures of neuronal population activity. In Aim 3, we will test the
predictions of our model to understand how manipulating the activity of different subtypes of inhibitory
interneurons affects topological summaries of neuronal activity and information processing in the network. This
work uses novel mathematical ideas to bridge different levels of the study of cortical circuits. It will have
implications for our understanding of the relationship between neuronal circuits and behavior across species,
systems, and theoretical approaches."
11034209,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sleep is an essential conserved behavior seen throughout life and is critical for brain health and maintenance
of cognitive functions such as learning and memory. Sleep disruption is intimately linked to aging and believed
to expose individuals to risk of developing Alzheimer's Disease (AD). After AD onset, continued decline in
sleep amount/quality is associated with progressive decline in memory performance and cognition. Therefore,
sleep disruption is a source of vulnerability as well as a potential therapeutic target to treat disease. A detailed
molecular understanding of the ontogeny of sleep disruption could aid in the development of earlier diagnosis
for AD, and in the identification of a therapeutic window for sleep-based medicines. We propose that promoting
quality sleep during the early stages of AD may delay or halt progressive cognitive decline. However, the
molecular basis of sleep's restorative processes that support cognition is poorly understood. Neuronal
synapses are the structures responsible for forming and storing memories, particularly in forebrain structures
such as the hippocampus and cortex. Our previous work shows that synapses are a major target for the
restorative actions of sleep. We have shown that a form of synaptic plasticity called homeostatic scaling-down
is engaged in the brain during sleep to support learning and memory functions. Synapse dysfunction is also
known to occur early in AD progression when the Tau protein begins to accumulate in the brain. We
hypothesize that aberrant synaptic Tau induces synaptic dysfunction by altering homeostatic scaling-
down, leading to hyperexcitability and sleep disruption. Sleep disruption, and loss of the restorative
homeostatic scaling, then accelerates disease pathology and cognitive decline. Preliminary findings indicate
sleep disruption is an early phenotype in a Tau-based mouse model of AD. In aim 1 we examine the interaction
between hallmark AD pathologies, amyloid plaques and Tau tangles, in driving sleep disruption, and examine
the necessity of Tau or amyloid in sleep disruption onset. We test the relationship between sleep disruption
and Tau pathology to establish sleep disruption as a biomarkers of pathology. In aim 2 we will use an in vitro
model system to dissect the molecular mechanisms by which pathogenic Tau proteins affect synapse function.
We will examine a particular cleaved Tau species known to accumulate at the synapse in AD human brain, and
examine the effect of cleaved Tau on restorative homeostatic scaling-down. In aim 3 we will examine the
sleep-dependent regulation of the endocannabinoid system during aging in AD model mice. Our preliminary
data show that endocannabinoid signaling is engaged during homeostatic scaling in cultured neurons, and that
regulation of endocannabinoids during the sleep-wake cycle is disrupted in AD model mice. We show that
acutely increasing the endocannabinoid anandamide using a pharmacological approach promotes sleep in
symptomatic AD mice. We will test the therapeutic efficacy of this sleep-promoting strategy in AD mice, with
the translational implications of modifying sleep behavior to alter AD onset or progression in human patients."

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects ~70 million people worldwide and is a major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma
and liver failure. Even with highly effective HCV treatment, recent data show that 80% of high-income countries
are not on target to meet the WHO goals of elimination of HCV. In most countries, the annual number of new
infections remains higher than the number cured by treatment. A vaccine for HCV should be possible because
25% of people resolve primary infection with effective anti-viral T cells and the generation of broadly neutralizing
antibodies (bNAbs). Recently, we have identified people who are repeatedly exposed to HCV with reinfection
and control of up to six distinct HCV infections, often of more than one HCV genotype. To date, one candidate
vaccine has been tested in an at-risk human population. This vaccine was designed to induce robust T cell
responses and was evaluated by proposal investigators for immunogenicity in healthy volunteers and for efficacy
in the prevention of HCV persistence in people at high risk of HCV infection. Although not protective against
chronic infection, vaccinated participants had significantly reduced mean peak HCV RNA compared to placebo
recipients. Our overarching hypothesis is that defining HCV-specific T cell and antibody mediated immunity in
effective control of HCV infection can be directly translated into more effective vaccine strategies. Therefore, we
plan an integrated analysis of T cell and B-cell/Ab mediated immunity alongside an assessment of viral antigen
sequences in resolved infection and vaccinees. This will inform the design and pre-clinical assessment of novel
vaccine strategies. In Project 1, CD4 and CD8 T cell responses will be compared between people who are
repeatedly exposed to and spontaneously control HCV and HCV clinical trial participants, both to define T cell
properties associated with HCV control, but also to identify the reasons for vaccine failure. NAbs also contribute
to successful control of repeated HCV exposure and work across several projects will identify and test novel
vaccine antigens and platforms with potential to induce anti-HCV bNAbs. Binding (Project 2) and structural
(Project 3) studies of bNAbs in complex with envelope proteins (E2 or E1E2) selected through a collaboration
between projects 2 and 4 will identify a panel of potential vaccine antigens with unique structural characteristics
that favor bNAb induction and maturation. Project 3 will develop nanoparticle (NP) and virus-like particle (VLP)-
based vaccines to present these E2 or E1E2 antigens and test them in mice. Project 5 will assess new T cell
immunogens in viral vectored vaccines, with viral vectored E2 or E1E2, NPs, or VLPs in mice, aiming to generate
both anti-E1E2 antibodies and the effective, genotype cross-reactive T cell responses defined in Project 1. We
will then test the two most successful vaccine candidates in non-human primates. The proposed integrative
research will provide a precise molecular description of infection events and the comprehensive characterization
of adaptive immune responses underlying effective HCV immune control, with new vaccine candidates assessed
in pre-clinical studies to identify the best vaccine antigens and strategy to advance to future human trials."

10261549,"ABSTRACT
Coronavirus-19 (CoV) can cause physical dysfunction, morbidity, and death from hyper-inflammation, acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multi-organ failure, particularly in older or chronically-ill individuals.
Across the US, >50% of CoV deaths are in nursing homes and 25-50% of nursing home residents who test
positive for CoV die from these complications. Senescent cells accumulate with age and drive frailty and
chronic diseases. These cells can acquire a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) entailing
release of many of the same factors as in CoV-induced cytokine storm. We found CoV antigens exacerbate the
SASP, SASP factors increase CoV viral entry proteins, and SASP factors impair viral defense mechanisms in
non-senescent cells. A coronavirus related to human CoV rapidly kills old but not young mice. We discovered
drugs that selectively eliminate senescent cells, senolytics. They alleviate age-related phenotypes and chronic
disorders in mice and are now in clinical trials, in which they have been found to reduce senescent cell burden,
inflammation, and frailty. We found that Fisetin, a natural product flavonoid, has a favorable safety profile in old
mice, monkeys, and elderly humans with multi-morbidity in a trial now underway in which 53 patients have
been treated. Fisetin decreased cytokine storm and mortality in mice infected with β-coronavirus. An FDA-
approved clinical trial of ours has now begun in older hospitalized CoV patients to prevent progression to
respiratory failure. Our hypothesis is that targeting senescent cells with Fisetin will delay or prevent
complications of CoV infection in those at great risk: elderly nursing home residents. Aim 1 is to test if Fisetin
prevents progression of morbidity in nursing home residents with rt-PCR-proven CoV infection but no, mild, or
moderate symptoms (WHO/NIH Classification) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial
across nursing homes associated with the NIA-supported Translational Geroscience Network. The primary
outcome in men and women age >65 (75 Fisetin-treated, 75 placebo) will be prevention of progression, based
on the WHO Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement of CoV. Other outcomes will be safety, need for
supplemental oxygen, escalation of care, and death. TGN-based nurses/study coordinators with their own PPE
will minimize impact on thinly-stretched nursing home staff. Fisetin can be provided to the study subjects in
foods and drinks. Aim 2 is to test if Fisetin delays, prevents, or alleviates hyper-inflammation and ARDS/multi-
organ failure in CoV-infected elderly nursing home residents. When feasible, we will ascertain if Fisetin
decreases SASP factors, senescent cell abundance, and viral entry proteins and reduces: progression to
severe or critical CoV, delirium, and hypo-oxygenation. Aim 3 is to test if Fisetin promotes recovery of CoV-
infected nursing home residents followed up to 6 months, including antibody response, physical function, and
lung fibrosis. This trial will pave the way for more nursing home trials of interventions not only for CoV, but
other conditions in the frail elderly. The impact of this clinical trial will extend beyond the current CoV epidemic."

While overall colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality have declined over the last several decades,
CRC incidence and mortality rates continue to be higher in African Americans (AAs) than non-Hispanic Whites
(NHW). Consensus CRC molecular tumor subtypes are important indicators of carcinogenic pathway and
prognosis, and area associated with specific somatic gene mutations, mismatch repair (MMR) phenotype, and
gene-specific methylation, although it is currently unknown whether racial differences in these subtypes
underlie racial disparities in CRC survival as these subtypes were derived from studies largely comprised of
NHW CRCs. The relative contributions of genetic, behavioral and environmental factors on CRC-related
outcomes in AA individuals remain largely unknown and there is a critical need for information about
pathogenesis to improve approaches to screening and treatment. This is especially true for area-level
socioeconomic factors, such as income and housing values, that are associated with higher risk of CRC but for
which the biologic consequences are not yet known. The overall goal of the study is to identify genomic and
social factors associated with CRC pathogenesis in a well-characterized cohort of AA CRC cases. We
hypothesize that tumor biology, here defined by somatic and epigenetic alterations in tumors, explains a
substantial proportion of the racial disparities in CRC outcomes, and area-level factors modify this relationship.
Our long-term goal is to improve our ability to diagnose, treat and prevent CRC through a comprehensive
understanding of the molecular events in tumors that arise in diverse populations."

This application request is a renewal of a previous funded NAMSED Cooperative Research Center that
encompassed a multidisciplinary team of basic scientists, physician scientists and engineers from institutions in
the Texas Medical Center (Baylor College of Medicine, Rice University, and the MD Anderson Cancer Center).
The objective of this new Biomimetic Cooperative Research Center (BCRC) is to build upon substantial progress
that included 42 publications from the previous funding period to use human intestinal organoids (HIOs) and recent
success in making nose and lung organoids (HNOs and HLOs) as biomimetics for the study of mucosal infectious
diseases. Enteric and respiratory infections are a leading cause of worldwide morbidity and mortality; our
understanding of the molecular and cellular drivers of infection of the key causal agents (studied in this proposal)
is hampered due to the lack of sufficient cellular, animal, and human models and substantial host-dependent
variation in infection susceptibility. The use of organoids will include next-generation engineering that augments
cellular complexity to now include immune and neuronal cell and microbiome co-culture, integration of multiple
organ or tissues systems, use of many donor lines to examine host-specific genetics and responses to infection,
and higher-order 3D mechano-physiologic processes that may alter infection outcomes. This BCRC application
integrates a team with multidisciplinary expertise in basic and translational research and innovation in virology,
bacteriology, genomics, developmental biology and physiology, and biomedical engineering and biomaterial
development to address important questions in the field. Project 1 will use HIOs to examine how human rotavirus
and norovirus infection replication and immune responses are impacted by autologous immune and neuronal cell
co-culture, co-infection with other pathogens, and commensal bacteria. Project 2 will examine the immunological
response to respiratory syncytial virus and coronavirus infection in nasal and lung organoids and with autologous
immune cells to establish preclinical HNO/HLO models that recapitulate human disease. HIOs will also be infected
to evaluate mechanistically the lung-gut axis of respiratory virus disease. Project 3 will determine the molecular
drivers of susceptibility to infection by enteroaggregative E. coli, including the effect of autologous immune co-
culture, mechano-physiologic cues such as flow and stiffness, and a fully integrated intestinal system comprised
of all four intestinal segments. All three projects, which have substantial synergy in theme and method, will be
supported by three Cores: the Administrative Core (AC - to facilitate governing aspects of the team), Human
Biomimetic Scientific Core (HBSC - to provide organoids and establish co-cultures), and the Engineering
MicroEnvironment Scientific Core (EMEC - to provide platforms and bioengineering of mechano-physiologic
cues into the organoid systems). At the completion of this funded period, our BCRC team will have advanced our
understanding of the molecular, cellular and mechano-physiologic drivers of mucosal disease while generating
new pre-clinical platforms to evaluate effective and safe therapeutics."

Timing is critical to neural processing. Nowhere is that clearer than in visual motion detection. To detect
motion, neurons transmit visual information with different latencies, or delays, allowing the circuit to compare
visual scenes over time. When comparisons over time are combined with comparisons over space, the circuit
can compute direction-selective signals, which are larger for motion in one direction than in the opposite
direction. These signals in turn guide a wide range of behaviors, from navigation and predator avoidance to
mating. This project proposes to investigate the origins and effects of timing differences in visual motion
circuits in the fruit fly Drosophila, a model organism in which powerful genetic tools can identify the roles of
individual neurons in computations. Using these tools, this research will identify mechanisms that underlie the
different dynamical responses of visual neurons and map out how those responses control downstream
computations. This work is significant for two reasons. First, motion detection is a canonical neural
computation, since it requires circuits to integrate visual information over both time and space, and because it
is necessarily nonlinear. Moreover, the anatomy, physiology, and computational structure of motion detection
has strong parallels between flies and mammalian retina and cortex. Therefore, it is likely that what we learn
about the mechanisms that regulate timing the fly eye and their effects on motion computation will be mirrored
in other circuits that detect visual motion. Second, our proposed aims will test fundamental models of motion
detection. All of these models rely on timing differences that permit comparisons to be made over time, but
these assumptions have not been tested. Our research will distinguish between proposed models in the fly and
test fundamental assumptions about how motion is computed by differences in the timing of neural signals. In
our complementary aims, we will uncover mechanisms that generate different timing in different neural
responses. We will also measure the effects of timing differences on motion signals and on behavior. On
completion, these studies will advance our understanding of how neural response timing is regulated and how
that timing determines downstream neural computations. We expect that what we learn in this small neural
circuit can serve as a scaffold for understanding the roles of timing in motion detection in the larger brains of
mammals."
10891760,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that has emerged as the most prevalent
form of late-life dementia in humans. The accumulation, aggregation, and deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) in the
brain are central events in AD pathogenesis. Despite intense effort, an effective therapy for AD has yet to be
established. While multiple genetic and environmental factors are involved in AD pathogenesis, the ε4 allele of
the APOE gene encoding apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD among
the three human APOE genotypes (ε2, ε3, ε4). In humans, Aβ deposition is more pronounced in APOE4 carriers
compared with non-carriers in both AD patients and aged healthy individuals. APOE plays a critical role in
maintaining synaptic plasticity and neuronal function by controlling lipid homeostasis, with the APOE2 allele
having a superior function. The ε2 allelic variant has been found to be more prevalent among centenarians and
associated with decreased susceptibility to AD. Studies on the role of the APOE2 in relation to AD suggest that
APOE2 is neuroprotective and positively associated with cognitive functions in aging. Therefore, increasing
APOE2 levels in the brain is predicted to be an effective therapeutic strategy for AD. Development of successful
strategies for treating these disorders is limited due to the protective function of blood brain barrier (BBB). Gene
therapy possesses a broad potential for the treatment of numerous neurological diseases, including AD.
However, the major challenge in the field of gene therapy is the design of safe non-viral vectors that can cross
the BBB. The transferrin (Tf) receptors are present on the surface of brain endothelial cells. The lipid
nanoparticles can be surface modified with Tf protein for targeting the brain endothelial receptors and conjugated
to brain specific cell penetrating peptide (CPP) for improving their internalization into brain by overcoming
receptor saturation. Therefore, we propose to design near neutral, PEGylated liposomal nanoparticles
encapsulating gene and modifying the surface of nanoparticles with Tf and CPP. Furthermore, the transfection
properties of chitosan will be utilized for improving the transfection of gene by facilitating endosomal escape via
the proton-sponge mechanism inside the cells. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to design a non-
viral gene delivery carrier for efficient delivery of plasmid DNA encoding APOE2 (pAPOE2) to brain for prevention
and treatment of AD. We propose three specific aims to accomplish the long-term goal of the proposed research:
Aim 1. Synthesize and characterize liposomal nanoparticles loaded with chitosan-pAPOE2 polyplexes:
The brain specific CPP-liposomes will be synthesized using thin film hydration technique followed by insertion of
Tf coupled micelles using post-insertion technique. We propose to use five BBB specific CPPs: (i) CGN (d-
CGNHPHLAKYNGT); (ii) RDP (KSVRTWNEIIPSKGCLRVGGRCHPHVNGGGRRRRRRRRR; (iii) Rabies Virus
Glycoprotein RVG-9R, (iv) a non-toxic fragment of tetanus toxin, tetanus toxin C fragment (TTC), and (v)
penetratin. The liposomal nanoparticles will be evaluated for particle size, zeta potential, encapsulation
efficiency, cell uptake and uptake mechanism(s), transfection efficiency, cell cytotoxicity, and hemolysis assay.
The transport efficacy of APOE2 loaded liposomal nanoparticles will be evaluated across an in vitro BBB model
designed by combining human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3), human astrocytes and
APP Swe/Ind- or MAPT P301L-overexpressing human neuroblastoma cells (SHSY5Y). We will also determine
the effect of liposomal nanoparticles on Aβ levels and Tau phosphorylation in the medium and cell lysates from
the co-culture system. Aim 2. Evaluate the in vivo biocompatibility, organ toxicity, pharmacokinetics and
APOE2 expression in mice of varying ages: To establish successful gene therapies for AD, we will validate
the Tf-CPP-liposomal nanoparticles for their biocompatibility, organ toxicity, and pharmacokinetics
(biodistribution) in wild type mice at 3 months of age. In addition, the APOE2 gene delivery will be further
validated in APOE-knockout mice at 3 and 24 months of ages. Aim 3. Assess the therapeutic effects of the
functionalized-liposome-mediated APOE2 gene delivery on cognitive impairment and Aβ and tau
pathology in vivo: To establish successful gene therapies for AD-related phenotypes and age-related cognitive
decline, we will examine effects of APOE2 gene therapy through the functionalized-liposomes on
neurobehaviors, synaptic functions and/or amyloid and tau pathology. The liposomes will be injected into amyloid
model APP/PS1 mice (3 and 6 months old), tau model PS19 mice (3 and 6 months old) and aged wild-type mice
(12 and 24 months old), and the effects will be assessed 3 months after the administration. For clinical relevance,
we will measure neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels in their plasma samples to assess effects on
neurodegeneration. In addition, we will also measure plasma concentrations of Aβ and p-tau in respective mouse
models. In addition, interstitial fluid Aβ clearance will be analyzed using in vivo microdialysis in the APP/PS1
mice at 3 months of age 1 month after the administration. Collectively, we anticipate that the proposed study will
contribute towards the development of high efficiency non-viral gene delivery system to cross the BBB for
successful gene therapy for neurological disorders and determine protective effects of increasing brain APOE2
on AD-related conditions."
10795721,"The ability to generate complex motor behaviors by assembling sequences of movements is essential for
purposeful actions and survival. Defects in the brain regions thought to drive such movement selection can lead
to behaviors becoming abnormally repetitive (e.g. autism spectrum disorder). Yet, the neural circuit architectures
that underlie this fundamental function of the nervous system remain poorly understood. A central model of a
neural circuit architecture that can account for how movements are assembled into sequences has emerged
from studies across multiple species. In this architecture, all movements are readied in parallel. Movements
within the sequence are then selected through hierarchical suppression, whereby earlier movements suppress
later ones. Prior studies have been unable to decipher how the model might arise from neuronal connectivity
and activity, in part due to the overwhelming complexity of neural circuitry in rodent models. We propose to
overcome this barrier through dissection of the neural circuitry underlying sequential body grooming movements
in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Drosophila offer a useful compromise between complexity and
tractability as they display a rich behavioral repertoire, while their brains are numerically compact and have
uniquely identifiable neurons whose activity can be visualized and manipulated using powerful genetic-based
techniques. Grooming is ideal for probing the circuit principles of movement sequences because it consists of a
predictable sequence of distinct movements. Using this system, we previously showed that the Drosophila
grooming sequence has the hallmarks of a parallel model, and established an infrastructure of tools and
approaches to dissect the circuit basis of the model. The objective of this proposal is to define how the neural
circuit synaptic connectivity and activity ready the different movements in parallel and then produce hierarchical
suppression, two fundamental mechanisms predicted by the parallel model. In Aim 1, we will define how the
circuitry is organized to enable the movements to be readied in parallel. In Aim 2, we will elucidate how
hierarchical suppression controls grooming movement selection. These Aims will contribute to the first
description of a neural circuit architecture that produces sequential behavior via hierarchical suppression. Such
architectures are not only proposed to underlie movement sequences across species including humans, but can
also provide a general mechanism by which competing parallel inputs can be integrated to produce a prioritized
output. Thus, our proposed study in the fruit fly will be relevant to other animals, both for understanding how
complex motor behaviors are produced and for understanding neural circuit organization and function more
broadly."
10891786,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
 Aging-induced cerebromicrovascular endothelial dysfunction is the primary factor in impairment
of neurovascular coupling (NVC) responses and dysregulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF),
contributing to the genesis of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). Heterochronic blood
exchange (HBE) in mice as well as bioassay experiments in cultured endothelial cells treated with sera
from human patients, non-human primates and rodent models of aging provide compelling evidence
that implicates non-cell autonomous mechanisms as key drivers of endothelial aging processes.
Guided by analysis of vascular transcriptomic changes in heterochronic parabiont mice the objective
of the proposal is to elucidate the mechanism of cerebromicrovascular rejuvenation activated by
specific circulating anti-geronic factors present in young blood. The central hypothesis is that young
blood rescues the age-related decline in signaling via the NAD+/SIRT1 axis and reverses circulating
IGF-1 deficiency, each of which can result in vascular mitochondrial rejuvenation, attenuation of
endothelial oxidative stress, improved endothelial vasodilator function and restoration of endothelial
angiogenic processes. The resulting increases in CBF and NVC responses reduce ischemic loci,
promoting brain health. The following aims are proposed: 1) Determine the role of the
cerebromicrovascular NAD+ /SIRT1 axis in rejuvenation by HBE. The working hypothesis is that HBE
rescues the age-related decline in NAD+, which rejuvenates cerebromicrovascular endothelial cells via
a SIRT1-dependent pathway. It is predicted that disruption of the NAD+ /SIRT1 axis will prevent
cerebrovascular rejuvenation by HBE in aged mice. 2) Determine the role of circulating IGF-1 in
cerebromicrovascular rejuvenation by HBE. The working hypothesis is that HBE reverses age-related
IGF-1 deficiency, which exerts multifaceted endothelial protective effects contributing to
cerebromicrovascular rejuvenation by young blood. It is predicted that HBE-mediated endothelial
functional and transcriptomic changes are partially prevented by disruption of IGF-1/IGFR1 signaling.
3) Determine how circulating NAD precursors and IGF-1 in young and old humans determine
cerebromicrovascular endothelial function and phenotype. This will be tested by bioassaying the effects
of circulating factors and integrating the results with existing endothelial function, NVC and CBF data
from the serum donors. To optimize cognitive status prediction with automated machine learning we
will perform association analyses of endothelial signatures with cerebrovascular and cognitive
measures using linear mixed effect models. Together, the proposed studies will elucidate the
involvement of two key mechanisms in the protective effects of HBE against cerebromicrovascular
aging and the pathogenesis of VCID."

ALACRITY for Early Screening and Treatment of High Risk Youth (eSToRY)
Barriers to quality mental health care for youth at risk of mental illness are well recognized but persistent,
especially among racial, ethnic, and language (REL)-minority youth. The proposed Center for Early Screening
and Treatment of at-Risk Youth (the eSToRY Center) is dedicated to research and training to improve early
detection of mental illness, to prevent adverse outcomes, to improve quality of care, and to foster equity in
treatment for REL-minority youth. The eSToRY Center is designed to identify interventions that close mental
health care access and treatment quality gaps among REL-minority youth. Through a strong web of
community-based connections, we will: a) collect and analyze real-time clinical and sociocontextual information
via an integrated data warehouse of adaptive symptom monitoring (CAT-MH), electronic health records (EHR),
insurance claims, and community data; and b) plan and manage the rollout and testing of measurement-based
mental health care.
Our proposed projects span community and healthcare system settings, recognizing the need to improve
access to treatment and quality of care once treatment is realized for REL-minority youth. In Aim 1, we develop
effective community-based outreach and screening programs to identify, refer and provide early interventions,
to youth at risk for developing mental illnesses. In Aim 2, we rigorously test and implement healthcare system-
based targeted interventions to prevent the development of mental illness and suicide in REL-diverse youth. In
Aim 3, we establish a Center for developing and testing innovative interventions to reduce disparities in access
and treatment for REL-minority youth and translating findings directly into clinical practice.
To accomplish these aims, we will create: an Administrative Core that oversees pilot studies, conducts training,
and promotes community participation; a Methods Core that leverages adaptive psychopathology screening
and social determinants of health screeners, implements rigorous randomized controlled trials, and conducts
predictive analytics to inform efforts to reduce disparities; three research projects that improve the identification
and early treatment of psychopathology, suicidality, and traumatic experiences among REL-diverse youth."
10883948,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cognitive decline is considered the greatest risk factor for financial exploitation in old age; yet, the financial
defrauding of cognitively-intact older adults is well-documented, and the reasons for this are poorly understood.
We believe that financial exploitation due to poor decision making in old age may be an early functional
harbinger of cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer’s Disease. Alzheimer’s Disease is
defined neuropathologically by accumulation of beta amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, and a network
of medial frontal, temporal, and parietal brain regions identified as the Default Network is particularly
susceptible to this age-associated neuropathology. Cortical deterioration in the posterior Default Network
(parietal and temporal lobes) occurs early in Alzheimer’s Disease, and since these regions subserve episodic
memory functions, these also decline early in the disease. However, it is also known that neuropathological
accumulation occurs early in medial frontal brain regions, the anterior portion of the Default Network. Although
medial frontal brain regions do not deteriorate structurally until later in the course of the disease,
neuropathological accumulation has been shown to impact functional connectivity of brain regions, and
correspondingly brain function, ahead of brain structure. Thus, early neuropathological accumulation in the
medial frontal brain networks may impact associated functions, and importantly, these medial frontal networks
are integral for financial decision making. In practice, clinical neuropsychological assessment batteries have
traditionally neglected consideration of medial frontal brain network functions, despite the fact that in preclinical
Alzheimer’s Disease changes in these medial frontal network functions may coincide or even precede
noticeable episodic memory changes. Behavioral economic preference measures in relation to time, risk, and
trust are tools that appear particularly sensitive to medial frontal brain network functions, and the use of these
in combination with common neurocognitive measurement approaches may offer a more sensitive and
comprehensive approach to assessing early brain changes leading to Alzheimer’s Disease. The overall goal of
this study is to examine the association of financial exploitation in old age with markers of Alzheimer’s Disease.
We hypothesize the experience of financial exploitation due to poor decision making is associated with greater
cognitive decline, greater change in behavioral economic preferences, greater deterioration in anterior Default
Network (medial frontal network) functional brain imaging measures, and greater Alzheimer’s Disease genetic
risk. Given significant heterogeneity in the causes, contextual factors, and consequences of financial
exploitation in old age to consider, qualitative research approaches to phenotype exploitation episodes will be
integrated with quantitative methods to more accurately identify exploitation experiences attributable to poor
financial decision making as opposed to other reasons. Findings will inform early detection and intervention
programs focused on cognitive health and wellbeing in old age."
10624196,"Background: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA's) Hospital In Home (HIH) program, designed from
experiences of the Hospital At Home community program, is a model of care that delivers patient-centered,
acute-level hospital care at home which has demonstrated safety, effectiveness and patient satisfaction
beyond those observed in hospitals. Since 2010, the VHA Office of Geriatrics & Extended Care (GEC), through
its transformational programs and mentored partnerships has spurred the development of [12] HIH program
sites nationally, which have all been sustained by their parent station.
Significance/Impact: [Hospital In Home is a mix of interventions and levels of implementations; understanding
how to weave these successfully is the overarching aim of this project.] Continued spread of HIH across the
VA requires evidence be established regarding the need for HIH and about the implementation of existing HIH
programs. Understanding barriers and facilitators and processes of implementation of HIH programs will allow
more facile adoption of HIH programs allowing for substantial cost savings of about $3,000 per inpatient event.
Especially in the era of the Mission Act, having HIH available may incentivize Veterans to choose VA. [With the
recent Covid-19 pandemic, HIH has been identified as a potential contributor to addressing the disease and
sequelae.]
Innovation: This project will generate generalizable knowledge regarding implementation of HIH models and
will advance implementation science from its application of implementation science frameworks, Re-Aim-
PRISM and novel methods such as Implementation Mapping. The project will curate knowledge garnered from
the existing programs and develop tools to disseminate it. It will develop and conduct readiness for
implementation surveys. Finally, it will “dry-run” implementations in sites with greater readiness for
implementation. The results of the “dry runs” will provide feedback to the implementation planning thus
increasing their probability of successful adoption of HIH and its sustainment and growth.
Specific Aims:
1. Establish evidence regarding the implementation of the existing HIH sites using a mixed methods
 approach. Deliverables: An evaluation framework and report summarizing the experiences of the existing
sites.
2. Develop operational implementation tools and a readiness for implementation survey to be conducted.
 Deliverables: A survey of readiness for implementation and prioritization of sites ready to implement;
 implementation tools.
3. Select ten new sites with the greatest evidence of readiness for implementation to conduct “dry-runs” and
 create blueprints for implementation; identify causal loop diagram(s); catalog the evidence. Deliverables:
 Report summarizing common and site specific implementation themes; Site-specific Implementation logic
 models; Searchable catalog of HIH implementation strategies.
Methodology: This mixed-methods project will conduct quantitative analyses, interviews, focus groups and
“dry runs” applying implementation science frameworks and methods (RE-AIM-PRISM, implementation
mapping) and system science to understand the existing HIH programs and to create implementation tools,
evaluation framework, readiness survey, causal loop diagrams and a searchable catalog of HIH
implementation evidence.
Implementation/Next Steps: Future work will develop simulation studies and conduct evaluations of newly
implemented sites as well as a hybrid II implementation trial of the effectiveness and safety of the HIH model."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – CENTER OVERVIEW
Infectious diseases continue to pervasively afflict global health and socioeconomic stability despite substantial
prevention and treatment initiatives. Respiratory and gastrointestinal pathogens rank amongst the most
intractable infectious diseases, particularly notable for recurrent waves of zoonotic coronaviruses and the recent
COVID-19 pandemic, engendered by SARS-CoV-2. Overall, an urgent need exists for improved in vitro
experimental models of human disease to study pathogenesis and to validate therapeutics. The central mission
of the Stanford/UNC Biomimetic U19 Research Center is thus to deploy novel 3-dimensional organoid culture
models to elucidate the biology and therapy of respiratory and gastrointestinal infectious pathogens.
 Our application is a renewal of our prior Stanford NAMSED U19 Research Center and is comprised of
two Cores and three research Projects, leveraging complementary and synergistic expertise of our investigators
at Stanford University and the University of North Carolina. The Center continues to be led by the Multi-PIs,
Calvin Kuo and Manuel Amieva, who also co-lead Core A (Administrative Core). Core B (Organoid Core) is led
by Calvin Kuo and provides novel capabilities for lung and GI organoid culture, gene editing and multiplexed
screening. The three Projects extensively utilize organoid biomimetics for exploration of GI and respiratory
pathogens. Project 1, (PI, Manuel Amieva) investigates H. pylori and Salmonella colonization, competition and
invasion in the GI tract, while Project 2 (PI, Harry Greenberg) investigates rotavirus host range, neutralization,
and M cell interactions in enteric biomimetics. Project 3 (PI, Ralph Baric) is a new addition and extensively uses
organoids to model SARS-CoV-2, other closely related epidemic and pre-epidemic emerging coronaviruses and
1918 H1N1 influenza to reveal common and unique host networks associated with severe pulmonary outcomes.
 The activities of the Stanford/UNC Biomimetic U19 Research Center reside within three overarching
Aims. In Aim 1, our Center performs organoid modeling of the epithelium-pathogen interface to investigate
pathogenesis, susceptibility and host range restriction. This employs robust reverse genetics and CRISPR
screens to systematically manipulate host versus viral/bacterial compartments, within novel apical-basal polarity
modulated distal lung/alveolar, nasal sinus, stomach and intestinal organoid systems. Aim 2 defines how SARS-
CoV-2, pre-epidemic coronaviruses, rotavirus and Salmonella can perturb reciprocal cross-talk between tissue
epithelium and resident immune cells. This exploits a unique 3D air-liquid interface organoid method preserving
GI and lung epithelium en bloc with diverse endogenous infiltrating immune cell types without artificial
reconstitution. Lastly, Aim 3 performs organoid-based evaluation of therapeutic candidates against SARS-CoV-
2, pre-epidemic coronaviruses and rotavirus in medium- to high-throughput formats including epithelium and/or
immune cells. Overall, the explorations of the Stanford/UNC Biomimetic U19 Research Center directly apply
advanced organoid systems to the investigation and therapy of recalcitrant infectious pathogens."
10883902,"Project Summary/Abstract: Novel approaches are needed to combat age-associated diseases of the brain,
including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Aging is the strongest risk factor for AD, yet we lack a detailed mechanistic
understanding connecting normal aging to AD. Emerging data raise the possibility that neural plasticity can be
revitalized in aged organisms. These studies demonstrate that factors present in young blood are restorative
for aged tissues throughout the body, while suggesting links between the systemic environment and aging- and
AD-related changes in the brain. Aged mice sharing young blood via parabiosis or those treated via plasma
injections exhibit improved plasticity and improved cognitive performance. We provided evidence for specific
youth-associated proteins, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP2) and colony-stimulating factor 2
(CSF2), that revitalize hippocampal function in aged mice when provided systemically. Conversely, several
studies demonstrate that aged blood factors drive key aging phenotypes, including microgliosis and loss of
neurogenesis, as well as hippocampus-dependent cognitive deficits, working in part through CCL11 and B2M.
These studies leave fundamental questions open regarding the role of the systemic environment in aging and
its link to AD through modulation of pathology. Recent work supports a role of blood-borne factors in
modulating the state and function of the brain’s innate immune cells, microglia. Given this connection and data
linking many AD risk genes to innate immune function, there is clear rationale to explore the link between aging
and AD-related pathology through microglia. In preliminary studies, we find that exposure to young blood
reduces microgliosis in the brains of aged mice, suggesting that young blood factors regulate microglia state in
aging. In this proposal, we will rigorously address the role of youth-associated proteins in altering microglial
gene expression and morphological profiles with the goal of clarifying the link between aging and AD
pathomechanisms. We hypothesize that youth-associated factors rejuvenate microglia profiles in the aged
brain and in the context of AD pathology. We will address this hypothesis in three major aims: (1) To determine
the impact of systemic TIMP2 on microglia gene expression and morphology in aged mice; (2) to characterize
the extent to which blood-borne brain rejuvenation is regulated by microglia function; and (3) to evaluate the
impact of a combined systemic treatment of TIMP2 and CSF2 on age-associated vs. AD-associated changes
in microglia profile and state. Our aims will interrogate the role of youth-associated blood-borne factors in
regulating microglia using sophisticated approaches to rigorously define cellular and pathological regulation by
the systemic environment, potentially opening novel avenues for AD therapy development."
10689862,"PROJECT SUMMARY (tech abs)
Even with the typical delays in diagnosis, more advanced stage distribution at diagnosis, and inadequate multidisciplinary
breast cancer treatment, these combined factors do not completely explain disparities in breast cancer mortality outcomes,
which persist after controlling for stage at diagnosis – and have been so for the past 50 years. The approximately two-fold
increased risk of TNBC in AA women has been confirmed by population-based incidence rates regionally as well as
nationally and across all age intervals. Compared to non-TNBC, triple negative disease has been confirmed to be an adverse
prognostic feature in AA patients, driving some of the mortality disparities. We hypothesize that altered mechanisms of
tumor immune responses, which underlies TNBC tumor biology differences between SRR, are caused by population-private
genetic variants among individuals with shared west African ancestry. These evolutionarily selected variants alter immune
cell behavior and inflammatory mechanisms, leading to novel tumor-immune cell types and significant differences in
leukocyte infiltration patterns, which may be associated with poor outcomes. We will perform an innovative multiomics
investigation of African-specific gene expression in TNBC, linked to immunological tumor phenotypes. We will harness
the novelty of rarely-investigated breast cancer patient populations from diverse African regions with TNBC cases from g
admixed populations (i.e. African-American and Afro-Caribbean). The most impactful innovation of this study is the
characterization of differential gene expression, coupled with integrated proteomics data, to identify novel tumor phenotypes
that are shared among women of the African diaspora. This work will be transformative to our understanding of tumor
heterogeneity and biological diversity across patient groups. We propose the follow aims: 1- Determine the ancestry-
associated differential gene expression profiles of immune and inflammatory-related genes in primary tumors across an
African-enriched cohort of 400 clinically annotated TNBC cases, to immune profiles linked to shared west African genetic
ancestry. 2- Characterize ancestry-associated differences in pathological tumor immune response characteristics, including
differences in tumor inflammation and/or tumor infiltration of specific immune cell types. 3-Create an African-enriched
panel of ex vivo models to validate/investigate the ancestry-associated drivers of altered genetic pathways and immune
responses. By completing these aims we expect to yield an African-enriched set of population-private, validated eQTLs,
associated with TNBC immune response mechanisms that can be further interrogated by our authenticated ex vivo models."
10835022,"Abstract
Prevention of HCV infection remains an important public health objective even with the recent adoption
of highly effective antiviral therapies. Importantly, treatment with direct acting antivirals (DAAs) does
not prevent reinfection in those who have successfully been treated. A vaccine to prevent HCV
persistence is needed to stem an emerging epidemic of infection in adolescents and young adults who
inject drugs that have limited access to screening and treatment. Only twenty five percent of acute
HCV infections resolve spontaneously. Resolution does, however, sharply reduce the risk of persistent
infection upon re-exposure to the virus. Memory CD4+ T helper and CD8+ cytotoxic T cell responses
contribute to accelerated clearance of a second infection. However, the role of neutralizing antibodies
during reinfection is less clear. Importantly, vaccines to generate an equivalent T cell response failed to
thwart off the rate of persistence in naïve recipients. Here, we will test the central hypothesis that
memory CD4+ T cells contribute significantly to HCV reinfection outcome by promoting expansion of
HCV-specific B cells and production of broadly neutralizing antibodies that contribute to viral clearance.
Unique features of this proposal are (i) the use of longitudinal samples from the Montreal cohort of high-
risk people who inject drugs. Participants are monitored prior to, during, and after HCV infection and
then subsequently followed again when they have been re-exposed to HCV a second time after
resolving their primary infection. (ii) We have assembled a team of investigators in Cairo, Egypt who
will assist us with recruiting and treating subjects undergoing DAA treatment. Egypt has the highest
prevalence of HCV infection in the world. In 2014, Egypt's government has made DAA treatment
affordable and 2.5 million subjects have started treatment. Understanding the immune responses in
these two cohorts will provide us with valuable information to develop an efficacious vaccine regimen
that would emulate the successful responses generated during a natural challenge with HCV.
Three highly interactive Projects are proposed. Project 1 (N. Shoukry, PI) will compare the frequency,
breadth, function, and phenotype of CD4+ T cells in HCV reinfections that either resolve or become
persistent. Project 2 (A. Grakoui, PI) will use new state of the art technology to isolate and
characterize antigen-specific B cells during HCV reinfection and post DAA treatment. Project 3 (R.
Amara, PI) will develop vaccine modalities to induce both a CD4+ T helper response and a robust
antigen-specific antibody response in blood and liver using DNA, modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) and
protein-based vaccines against HCV proteins in non-human primates."

Announcement OTA-20-011 ACTIV Integration of Host-targeting Therapies for COVID-19 for the role
of Administrative Coordinating Center (ACC). The title of our application is ACTIV Integration of
Host-targeting Therapies for COVID-19 Administrative Coordinating Center.
The Integration of Host-targeting Therapies for COVID-19 Program aims to identify COVID-19
interventions relevant to heart, lung, blood, and cardiovascular outcomes that contribute to the scientific
knowledge base are likely to inform clinical practice. This Program will rapidly and efficiently conduct
adaptive platform trials via a coordinated effort of Data Coordinating Centers and clinical sites from
existing Clinical Study Networks. The ACC is a critical component of the Program. We will coordinate
with NHLBI to ensure collaboration among networks including the use of standardized approaches in
clinical trial design and conduct, data collection and validation, and statistical analysis such that studies
are launched, implemented and analyzed swiftly; and study findings are scientifically sound and meet
regulatory needs for medical therapy development. As the ACC, we will also serve the vital role of
facilitating communication and information sharing among all relevant stake holders and helping NHLBI
in tracking study-specific and Program-wide milestones.
Sonia Thomas, DrPH, will lead the ACC as Principal Investigator. She is an experienced CC PI and
statistician with 25 years of experience in the design, implementation, and analysis of multicenter NIHand
industry-sponsored Phase 2-4 clinical trials of drugs, biologics, devices, surgical and behavioral
interventions in more than a dozen therapeutic indications. Dr. Thomas will be supported by Tracy
Nolen, DrPH as Alternate PI, an experienced Consortium and CC PI and clinical trial statistician, and
subject matter experts Steve Nissen, MD, Cleveland Clinical Chief Academic Officer, Heart and
Vascular Institute, Shannon Carson, MD, Univ. of North Carolina Chief of Pulmonary and Critical Care
Medicine, and Anastasia Ivanova, PhD, Univ. of North Carolina Professor of Biostatistics
Under Dr Thomas’s direction, our team will lead, support, and collaborate with Program Networks
through organization into 6 ACC Cores: Program Operations, Scientific Leadership and
Prioritization, Informatics, Data Standards, Study Design, Implementation, & Analysis, and
Regulatory and QA. We have identified milestones for the essential activities of the ACC within each of
these 6 Cores with a detailed focus on the activities in the first 6 months as activities completed during
this time are most important for ensuring the coordinated, expedited and efficient launch of this Program.
Dr. Thomas, our subject matter experts, senior statistical scientists, and many of the core leads have
substantial experience with NHLBI and thus understand the needs and priorities of the Institute and will
use this knowledge to better collaborate with NHLBI and further speed up the launch of this Program.
We are willing to collaborate with all involved entities as part of the overarching trans-NIH ACTIV
Program as it evolves. We recognize and anticipate that swift adaptation will be required to rapidly
respond to the urgent clinical research needs to address the COVID-19 pandemic.
RTI is uniquely and substantially qualified for the ACC. We will use our team’s broad experience from
many complex coordinating center projects to anticipate the needs for this Program and “hit the ground
running”. Proven informatics technology in use by existing NIH programs will be swiftly modified by
our analysts for speedy deployment of communications platforms. Our organizational size and flexibility
will allow us to ramp up quickly and modify personnel resources flexibly. Lastly, RTI has a proven track
record of successful collaborations with other coordinating centers on complex programs, yet as we are
not directly involved with any Networks for consideration to be NHLBI COVID-19 trials sites, we
provide independence and objectivity to the Program."
10700434,"Sensory processing requires the interaction between external inputs and an internal brain state. Pain is a unique
sensory experience that is triggered by external signals, but is also strongly shaped by internal cognitive and
emotional variables. At the circuit level, there is not a single primary pain cortex; instead, a distributed network
of cortical areas process and regulate pain. For example, the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) is known to
process stimulus-evoked information, such as location and timing. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), in
contrast, gives rise to the aversive experience of pain and displays a high level of neuronal plasticity in the
chronic pain state. Meanwhile, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) can strongly modulate pain behaviors. However, the
mechanisms whereby these distributed cortical pain circuits integrate information remain largely unknown.
Thus, we propose a novel conceptual and computational framework for pain as a converging, temporally
specific, interaction among the S1, the ACC, and the PFC. This interaction can be described by a predictive
coding framework that combines feedforward inputs with top-down predictions dependent on prior aversive
experiences, and modulatory commands, based on neural activities in the S1, ACC and PFC. To test this
hypothesis, we will create a new set of tools for pain studies. We will design devices to accurately measure
pain responses; engineer closed-loop brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) to selectively perturb cortical circuits
during the precise time course of pain; and define novel statistical methods such as mechanistic mean-field
models to analyze dynamic cortical information integration, using local field potentials (LFPs) and ensemble
spikes. In Aim 1, we will identify the impact of the nociceptive information on central pain circuit dynamics. We
will characterize the directed information flow between the S1, ACC, and PFC (more specifically the prelimbic
PFC), before and after noxious stimulation. We will create closed-loop BCIs using a real-time pain detection
algorithm based on statistical analyses of simultaneous spikes and LFPs in the S1 and ACC to optogenetically
modulate the S1, and show that such perturbations disrupt the integration of signals from the ACC and PFC to
impact pain behaviors. We will also analyze how chronic pain alters predictive coding schemes and response
to acute pain. In Aim 2, we will use BCIs to test the impact of ACC modulation on neural activities in the S1 and
PFC, as well as on pain behaviors. More importantly, we will show that chronic pain can induce maladaptive
plasticity in the ACC, which in turn alters the information flow from the S1 and PFC to give rise to pain
anticipation and tonic pain – two examples of pain experience driven by an internal aversive state. In Aim 3, we
will show that BCI-driven modulation of PFC outputs can provide scalable regulation of the nociceptive
information flow from the S1 and ACC to alter pain behaviors. Further, we will show how such cortical
modulation is impaired by chronic pain."
10892055,"IMPACT CENTER OVERALL SUMMARY:
Optimizing Evidence-Based Practice Implementation for Clinical Impact
The goal of the IMPACT Center is to accelerate the impact of evidence-based practices (EBPs) for youth
receiving mental healthcare in low-resourced community-based settings. These settings, which include commu-
nity mental health centers and schools, provide mental healthcare to most low-income, ethnically diverse youth
who receive services. In these settings, EBPs are not implemented widely or with fidelity, and youth have high
unmet mental health needs, leading to adverse outcomes. In IMPACT, we focus on optimizing EBP implemen-
tation in low-resourced community settings for four of the most common youth mental health conditions: depres-
sion, anxiety including posttraumatic stress, and behavioral conditions. To provide high-quality treatment for
youth, community settings need support to optimize EBP implementation. The field of implementation science
has tried to address this research-practice gap; however, a recent editorial call for more “practical implementation
science” that generates solutions in partnership with the practice community leading to tools they can use inde-
pendently for EBP implementation. In IMPACT, we will partner with stakeholders in developing, refining, employ-
ing, and disseminating user-friendly methods and tools to accelerate the impact of EBPs for youth.
 IMPACT targets 3 implementation challenges: (I) Identify and prioritize determinants to EBP implementation;
(II) Match implementation strategies to prioritized determinants; and (III) Test and optimize strategies according
to practice partner goals (e.g., reach, preference, impact, efficiency, affordability). Our Methods Core is a trans-
disciplinary team from clinical, community, and organizational psychology; information, computer, and imple-
mentation sciences; anthropology; medicine; public health; and user-centered design. We will develop methods
and toolkits for each challenge, co-designed and refined with practice partners for acceptability, feasibility, and
appropriateness. Our partnership with the WA EBP Initiative is an ideal laboratory for developing new methods.
 The IMPACT Center, a Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute-University of Washington
partnership, is codirected by Lewis and Dorsey. The Administrative Core will support stakeholder engagement,
maximize Center learning, and foster synergy and integration across the Cores, exploratory projects, and pilot
grant program. This Core will lead dissemination to the practice and scientific communities, training, and evalu-
ation of IMPACT. The Methods Core will collaboratively develop new methods, support investigators and train-
ees, and actively participate in outreach. The exploratory projects will employ and refine methods from IMPACT's
three challenges, developing and testing practical implementation strategies to improve treatment quality and
client outcomes via EBP implementation. Project 1 optimizes measurement-based care, a foundational frame-
work to guide EBP delivery. Project 2 optimizes and tests a peer-led, frontline leader-focused strategy to optimize
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for four most common youth conditions. Project 3 increases reach and impact
of an effective, multicomponent engagement strategy for clinicians in schools to use trauma-focused CBT."
10883905,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of late-onset dementia, affecting more than 5.5 million
Americans. Currently, there are no approved therapies that can halt or reverse AD. AD is initiated by amyloid
beta (Aβ) peptides that form extracellular aggregates; these promote intraneuronal tau hyperphosphorylation
and aggregation, which subsequently lead to neuronal death. These lesions elicit a secondary response by
microglia, which undergo prominent changes manifest as a transcriptional signature known as disease-
associated microglia (DAM). Genetic studies of human AD have suggested that microglia modulate disease
course. Most notably, heterozygous hypomorphic variants of the microglial receptor TREM2 increase the risk of
AD several fold. Supported by this grant, our mechanistic studies in various mouse models demonstrated that
microglia require TREM2 to acquire the DAM profile and respond to AD pathology. Given these advances in our
understanding of how TREM2 is relevant to microglial response, it is important to understand the TREM2
signaling pathway in detail and determine whether it can be exploited for AD therapy.
 In our recent snRNA-seq study of brain specimens from AD patients with and without TREM2 risk
variants, we found that human microglia upregulated the expression of genes integral to the DAM signature
together with “homeostatic” genes and the transcription factor IRF8. This signature echoed that of microglia in a
mouse model of peripheral nerve injury that reflects a response to neuronal death and is driven by IRF8. We
validated IRF8 expression in human AD microglia and demonstrated that IRF8 expression is reduced in patients
carrying the TREM2 AD risk variant. Furthermore, in epigenetic studies of mouse microglia we have found that
TREM2 promotes transcriptional activation of target genes through IRF8. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis
that IRF8 plays a key role in driving the microglial response to AD pathology downstream of TREM2 using mouse
models that combine Aβ and tau aggregation with neuronal death and lack or overexpress Irf8 in microglia.
 In a second recent study, we investigated the effects of an agonistic anti-human TREM2 mAb in mice
that accumulate Aβ and express human TREM2 variants rather than endogenous TREM2. A single injection of
anti-human TREM2 mAb was sufficient to expand metabolically active and proliferating microglia. Moreover,
prolonged mAb treatment partially reduced the neurotoxicity of Aβ plaques, although it did not change the Aβ
load and only mildy modified behavior. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that changes in the dosing or
initiation of mAb treatment can moderate the Aβ load and improve cognitive behavior through appropriate
modulation of the TREM2-IRF8 axis. Since TREM2 gene dosage has been proposed to control the beneficial or
detrimental effects of TREM2 on tau pathology, Specific Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that a mouse model of
tau may benefit from appropriate mAb engagement of TREM2. Overall, this proposal will provide mechanistic
insights into AD pathogenesis and validate TREM2 as promising target for AD prevention and/or therapy."
10883920,"Project Summary
Age is the single strongest predictive factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The vast majority of AD cases arise
sporadically in the seventh decade of life or beyond, with no known etiology aside from advanced age. To
understand cellular and molecular changes at the root of AD, studies need experimental methods that discrim-
inate healthy from pathological aging. Until now, options for in vitro study of aged human neurons, the cell type
devastated by AD, have been lacking. This proposal will use induced neurons (iNs), a method that generates
neurons from fibroblasts by direct transdifferentiation, to study the cellular processes in neuronal aging and
AD. Unlike induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons, which pass through a stem cell intermediate
phase and become physiologically rejuvenated, iNs retain age-related features of their source fibroblasts.
Gene expression, epigenetic marks, and cell metabolism in iNs correspond to the age of the donor. Using the
iN system, this proposal will evaluate the interaction between two age-correlated factors associated with the
AD brain: cellular senescence and inflammation. Preliminary data demonstrate that iNs from AD patients are
more likely to show protein markers of senescence and upregulation of senescence-associated genes than iNs
from healthy aged controls (CTL). In Aim 1, senescent and non-senescent cells from AD and CTL Iines will be
examined by RNA-Seq and ATAC-Seq. These analyses will identify pre-existing differences in non-senescent
AD neurons that differentiate them from CTL as well as specific components of cellular senescence that are
unique to neurons, a cell type in which the existence of senescence remains controversial. In other tissues,
senescent cells release inflammatory factors (collectively termed the senescence associated secretory pheno-
type or SASP) that disrupt the local environment, contributing to age-related tissue dysfunction. In Aim 2, the
ability of secreted factors from AD and CTL iNs to activate human astrocytes and microglia will be assessed.
These experiments will generate a list of neuronal components of the SASP and identify which are contributors
to the chronic inflammation that arises with AD. Finally, Aim 3 will examine cellular processes hypothesized to
be upstream of senescence. Prior work and preliminary data show that AD and CTL iNs differ in their cellular
metabolism and intracellular nucleotide pools. The nucleotide content of AD and CTL iNs will be compared,
and small molecules will be used to manipulate components of nucleotide synthesis or salvage and test the
resulting impact on senescence. These studies will reveal whether inherent differences in nucleotide metab-
olism lead to increased rates of cellular senescence and contribute to the inflammatory response. As a whole,
these studies will provide novel insights into how senescence and inflammation interact within the aged
neuronal environment that is permissive to AD."
10884101,"ABSTRACT
 It is suggested that infections increase the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the evidence
behind this is not well described. Infections, infectious agents, and their toxic products are associated with short-
and long -term cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Potential links between infections and AD include the
activation of the peripheral immune system, the increase in the permeability of the blood-brain barrier, the
production of inflammatory mediators, and the presence of peripheral immune cells in the brain triggering a
severe glial cell activation, among others. Imbalance of the immune system also increase the synthesis and
accumulation of the amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide, the hyperphosphorylation of tau, and the induction of chronic
inflammation in the brain. The main goal of this project is to investigate the role of peripheral and brain infections
in the development of AD. Our aims are to study the role of sepsis and meningitis in brain amyloid and tau
pathology, associated cognitive decline, and brain inflammation. We expect that outcomes from this project will
help us to identify and understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the role of infection in the
pathogenesis of AD. For this purpose, we will use a series of established and novel biochemical assays in animal
models of AD and human-derived samples. Mouse models of brain Aβ and tau accumulation will be subjected
to peripheral infection through cecal ligation and perforation (CLP) surgery, or to bacteria administration into the
cisterna magna to induce meningitis. Then, we will assess whether these infection modalities trigger, accelerate,
or worsen AD pathology. The participation of the peripheral immune system in these events will be explored by
bone marrow transplants from non-AD mice subjected to infection to naïve AD mouse models. Clinically, we will
test for the presence of disease-associated Aβ and tau in the blood of septic and post-septic patients and the
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of individuals afflicted by meningitis. This project will provide us with valuable insights
into events associated with AD risk and will produce critical data for understanding the role of the immune system
in dementia. Clinically, this research may help identify individuals with an increased risk for developing AD."

Pediatric high-grade gliomas including Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Gliomas (DIPG) are aggressive brain tumors
that occur in children. The lifespan for these patients after diagnosis is about one year with no cure in sight.
Countless clinical trials have been performed without success and treatment remains palliative despite
extensive research over the past decade. It is therefore critical to identify new therapies for these deadly
diseases. Among pediatric patients, one of the most devastating brain tumor types is diffuse midline gliomas
with the H3K27M mutation, which includes the previously named Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG).
Recently, somatic mutations in the H3F3A gene, one of the 16 genes that encode Histone H3, have been
detected in the majority of high-grade pediatric glioma cases including DIPG. This mutation leads to an amino
acid change at lysine (K) 27 residue of H3.3 to methionine (M). The H3K27M mutation is a striking example of
a genetic alteration that drives tumorigenesis by modifying the epigenome. H3K27 is modified post-
translationally by either acetylation or methylation. H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) plays an important role in
gene silencing during stem cell differentiation and maintenance. The major pathologic finding in H3K27M
tumors is a global loss of H3K27me3. The changes in H3 Lysine methylation patterns dramatically change
gene expression and are likely to function as drivers of malignancy in these tumors. Our goal is to develop new
therapies for treating children with H3K27M tumors by developing a toolbox of primary and secondary assays
and to identify small molecule compounds that increase the suppressed H3K27me3 levels in tumors with the
H3K27M mutation. Our preliminary data along with others show increasing H3K27me3 leads to tumor death in
H3K27M mutant tumors. Building on these exciting results we hypothesize that a disease-relevant high-
throughput screening (HTS) assay can be developed and executed leading to novel therapeutic agents for
brainstem tumors with the H3K27M mutation."

The Center for Perioperative Mental Health will address a glaring deficiency in perioperative healthcare by
creating a translational platform for improving the mental healthcare of older adults undergoing surgery and
other invasive procedures. The World Health Organization defines health as a state of complete physical,
mental, and social well-being. Although perioperative medicine has developed a strong emphasis on
optimizing perioperative physical health and preventing major medical complications, the integration of mental
healthcare into perioperative care has been perfunctory. This is highlighted by evidence that depression
and anxiety are common perioperative problems that are inadequately managed in the perioperative setting;
and surgical patients with depression and anxiety have substantially worse physical, mental and social
outcomes. These negative consequences manifest as impaired long-term recovery and rehabilitation, with
hospital readmissions, persistent depression and anxiety, and ultimately poor functional recovery and quality of
life. Therefore, this Center for Perioperative Mental Health provides a timely intervention that will yield
improved perioperative health outcomes for older adults who are especially vulnerable in this period. This
transformation in care and outcomes will be actualized through the integration of evidence-based mental
healthcare into the perioperative paradigm. We propose a combined behavioral and pharmacological
intervention bundle targeting three key priority areas. First, we will provide behavioral activation, a flexible
component of cognitive behavioral therapy and standalone treatment focusing on reinforcing activities. Second,
we will optimize the pharmacological treatment of depression and anxiety. Third, we will deprescribe
medications that are harmful for brain health. In order to overcome barriers to effective, implementable care,
we will: (1) adapt, optimize and personalize treatment plans based on the heterogenous needs of different
surgical patients; (2) test effectiveness of the treatments; and (3) speed their implementation in the real-world.
The Center is structured to maximize the likelihood of success. This includes an experienced, administrative
leadership core; a sophisticated, multi-disciplinary methodological infrastructure; a diverse team of clinical
researchers and implementation scientists; and advisory boards with broadly representative stakeholders and
internationally renowned experts. Three pragmatic trials in distinct surgical subpopulations will establish how
best to implement the mental healthcare bundle in diverse surgical settings. Our vision for the Center for
Perioperative Mental Health is a transdisciplinary platform to rapidly advance the science and practice of
perioperative mental and cognitive healthcare. This Center has the potential for substantial public health
impact by revolutionizing the approach to perioperative care, based on firm evidence and clinical translation."
10753481,"Precision medicine requires tools that visualize diseased cells to enable diagnosis, facilitate surgical resection,
and monitor therapeutic response. Technologies to identify the interface of cancer and healthy tissues require
the ability to illuminate cancer cells with exceptional selectivity over healthy cells. This also requires optical
imaging probes that can selectively illuminate cancer in vivo. To date, molecular optical dyes utilized for
preclinical and clinical imaging studies are comprised of lipophilic organic molecules with limited water solubility,
predominantly hepatic clearance profile, residing in an “always on” state. These significant drawbacks motivate
investigation of alternative optical probes that exhibit improved water solubility and pharmacokinetics paired with
the ability to produce signal only in the target tissues of interest.
Luminescent lanthanide complexes with emissive properties in the first NIR (near-infrared) window provide a
highly water soluble and biocompatible alternative to lipophilic organic fluorophores with predominantly hepatic
clearance profiles. Excitation of luminescent lanthanides is most efficient at wavelengths of 250–350 nm. While
the resulting, effective Stokes-shift of is conveniently large, the short-wavelength excitation is incompatible with
the first biological optical imaging window of 550–1000 nm. This has prevented application of discrete
luminescent lanthanide complexes as optical probes for in vivo imaging applications to date. Our group has
pioneered the application of Cherenkov radiation (CR) of radionuclides for the in situ excitation of discrete
lanthanide complexes. CR is produced by isotopes decaying under emission of charged particles in dielectric
media and exhibits a maximum intensity below 400 nm. We have demonstrated that luminescent lanthanide
antenna complexes are ideal acceptors for Cherenkov radiation-mediated energy transfer (CRET). Here, we
propose to devise and implement targeted CRET lanthanide probes to image cancer heterogeneity with
multiplexed, optical imaging in vivo."
10812461,"OVERALL: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The central hypothesis of the proposed P01 Program is that Ebola virus infection leads to cell-type specific
transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and posttranslational alterations that create aberrant counterproductive
responses of immune cells, leading to a dysregulated immune response, which paradoxically produces “immune
paralysis” and hyperinflammation. To address the hypothesis, three Research Projects are proposed. Research
Project 1 focuses on pathogenic mechanisms at the transcriptional level, while Research Project 2 focuses on
posttranscriptional events, and Research Project 3 focuses on posttranslational modifications, each contributing
to the dysregulated immune response to Ebola virus. The dysregulated immune response is responsible for most
of the pathogenesis observed in Ebola virus disease.
All projects require the BSL-4 Core (Core B), which will be responsible for performing infections of human
immune and nonimmune cells, nonhuman primates, and the initial steps of experiments that involve infectious
virus. Importantly, Core B will provide each of the research projects samples from the same experimental
samples insuring that data from each project can be compared directly—this is a unique feature of this P01
Program. The Proteogenomics Core (Core C) will be responsible for massive parallel sequencing and mass
spectrometry-based studies. The Bioinformatics and Modeling Core (Core D) is critical for generating tools
employed in the experimental designs, including statistical help for OMICS experiments, analyzing OMICS data
and integrating OMICS data into networks that model the behavior of various cell populations infected with
EBOV. The work done in Core D will synthesize a model to explain how transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and
posttranslational responses of individual cell populations lead to immune dysregulation. The comprehensive
picture painted by this collaborative effort will revolutionize our understanding of the immunopathogenesis of
severe acute viral infections (e.g., immune imbalance seen in COVID-19). The Administrative Core (Core A)
will be responsible for strategic planning, continual evaluation, and communication and coordination of activities
among the various components of the project according to a detailed management plan.
The expected outcomes will contribute substantially to our knowledge of the fundamental mechanisms of the
immunopathogenesis of EBOV infections toward the development of effective countermeasures. The expected
outcomes will include (1) detailed knowledge of transcriptional mechanisms leading to the dysregulated immune
response to EBOV, (2) elucidation of the role of posttranscriptional mechanisms in the dysregulated immune
response to EBOV, (3) elucidation of the role of posttranslational mechanisms in the dysregulated immune
response to EBOV, and (4) experimental validation of the identified pathogenic mechanisms and their targeting.
The proposed tightly coordinated and comprehensive analysis has not been done before for any virus."

The overall goal of this U19 project is the development of an HCV vaccine to prevent disease progression after
virus exposure in a vaccinated host. Our overall approach is based on a growing body of data from studies in
patients undergoing primary HCV infections indicating that a subset of these individuals generates immune
responses that result in viral clearance and conferring immunity against reinfection. This naturally occurring
protective immunity appears to include early and robust humoral and cellular responses during the acute phase
of infection. Consequently, the early kinetics, strength, and quality (i.e., cross-protective capacity of both humoral
and cellular responses against the diversity of the evolving HCV quasispecies) are critical for efficient clearance
of repeated exposures to diverse HCV isolates/infections in at-risk individuals. Thus, a successful vaccine will
need to induce robust and durable adaptive B and T cell immune responses in the vaccinated host. This Program
is designed to achieve this goal by four complementary Projects and a Scientific Core. Project 1 focuses on a
structure-guided approach to develop an immunogen that enhances the induction of broadly neutralizing
antibodies (bNAbs) including those when combined lead to synergistic virus neutralization. This project will
interact extensively with Project 4 on structural analysis of HCV envelop glycoproteins and on structural aspects
of bNAbs and receptor binding to HCV particles. Project 2 will design HCV NS Mosaic antigens for T cell
recognition of HCV genotypes and subtypes that cause most infections globally. Mosaic antigens are designed
computationally by recombination of viral genomic sequences retrieved from databases. Project 3 takes a
systems approach to evaluate short- and long-term B and T cell responses and innate responses to vaccination
with vaccines that are formulated in Projects 1 and 3, and in combination with powerful adjuvants. These studies
will be undertaken in non-human primates that will be executed in a Scientific Core. The Administrative Core will
provide the operational support necessary to successfully achieved the goals we have laid out for each project
and program as a whole. Taken together, the work proposed in these projects and scientific core are highly
interdependent that will lead to a vaccine design capable to elicit protective B and T cell immunity against HCV.
We expect that at the end of this program project, we will have a candidate vaccine to begin pre-clinical studies
that will progress to Phase I/II clinical trial."

Psychiatric illnesses, including schizophrenia, affect a significant proportion of the population, yet current
treatments are only partially effective for many individuals and, in the case of SZ, do little to address disabling
cognitive and negative symptoms. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop biomarkers to identify at-risk
individuals for early intervention and new molecular pathways to target for development of novel therapies. An
increasingly compelling pathway associated with SZ is immune dysregulation. This proposed renewal of the
UC Davis Conte Center brings together investigators with a unique combination and wide range of
complementary expertise to address a critical gap in knowledge related to the potential links between immune
dysregulation and psychiatric illness. During the previous funding period, we took a multi-pronged approach to
test our Center hypothesis that early activation of the maternal immune system alters brain development
in offspring leading to structural and functional changes in connectivity that are associated with the
emergence of psychopathology in adolescence and young adulthood. Four important findings emerged
from those studies that serve as the premise for this renewal application. First, we discovered two factors in the
mouse model that predict susceptibility and resilience of offspring to MIA, allowing us to study why MIA causes
aberrant outcomes in only a subset of pregnancies and how it can lead to diverse phenotypes in offspring.
Second, we found signatures of abnormal brain development in our male MIA NHP offspring as early as 6
months of age, indicating that the early postnatal period is critical for understanding the impact of MIA on brain
development. Third, combined results from NHP and mouse models point to cortico-striatal circuitry as central
to behavioral outcomes in MIA offspring. Finally, convergence between MIA NHP imaging findings and recent
onset SZ support the clinical relevance of the MIA models. In this renewal, we will continue to test our original
Center hypothesis across species (mouse and NHP MIA models and humans with SZ), through three specific
aims: (i) Identify immune signaling pathways in females before and during pregnancy that confer susceptibility
or resilience to distinct subsets of MIA-induced behavioral phenotypes in offspring, (ii) Determine the
contribution of cortico-striatal circuits to susceptibility, resilience and phenotypic heterogeneity in MIA mouse
and NHP offspring and in individuals with SZ, and (iii) Determine how sex contributes to susceptibility,
resilience and phenotypic heterogeneity in MIA offspring and individuals with SZ. Successful completion of
these Aims, which could only be accomplished in a highly integrated interdisciplinary Center as proposed, will
identify causal molecular pathways in specific neural circuits critical for guiding the development of
interventions optimized for the developmental age and sex of at-risk offspring following MIA. They will also
reveal new immune signaling pathways that can be targeted for the development of biomarkers to identify at-
risk pregnancies, and a new class of much-needed therapeutic interventions to prevent SZ and other NDDs."
10883938,"ABSTRACT
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia; it is increasingly evident that
cerebrovascular mechanisms are critically involved in AD pathology. Cerebrovascular disease frequently co-
occurs with AD. One driver of this disease is pathologic fibrin deposition (PFD) in the cerebrovasculature
caused by resistance to plasmin-mediated fibrin breakdown. PFD is a risk factor for AD, both non genetic
(traumatic brain injury) and genetic (ApoE4), and amyloid beta (Aβ) modifies the fibrin clot, making it resistant
to plasmin cleavage and worsening PFD. Thrombin cleaves fibrinogen to fibrin and it also activates platelets by
cleaving and activating protease-activated receptors PAR1 and PAR4. We have found that platelet PAR4 is
responsible for greater platelet activation, thrombin generation, and procoagulant microparticle formation than
platelet PAR1. PAR4 is also expressed on endothelial cells, leukocytes, microglia and neurons, where it is
activated by thrombin, leading to activation of microglia, blood brain barrier (BBB) breakdown and microbleeds.
Lymphocyte PAR4 is required for homing to sites of inflammation and PAR4 expression is inducible under
inflammatory conditions, leading to exaggerated local damage. F2RL3, the gene encoding PAR4, is
hypomethylated under inflammatory conditions. Our hypothesis is that PAR4 antagonism may minimize PFD
by 1) decreasing thrombin generation and fibrin deposition, and 2) blocking lymphocyte infiltration and local
tissue damage. In support of our hypothesis, we have found in preliminary data that PAR4 is overexpressed in
the cerebrovasculature of 5XFAD mice with 5 familial AD mutations. In addition, we have shown that in aged
humans higher levels of F2RL3 expression in the prefrontal cortex are associated with a faster rate of cognitive
decline. As a GPCR, PAR4 is an attractive therapeutic target, and we have made significant progress on
generating PAR4 antagonists. However, they do not yet have potent activity against the endogenous tethered
ligand in either human or mouse platelets, or the DMPK characteristics to be useful in vivo. In Aim 1, we
propose to use a computational approach starting with comparative models of both mouse and human PAR4
to screen an ultra-large library using DOCK and ROSETTA, combined with a make-on-demand small molecule
library. Based on the success of the Shoichet and Roth laboratories using this approach to generate pM
potency, highly selective compounds for GPCRs, we expect to enrich the scaffold diversity of our SAR. We will
iteratively screen compounds in mouse and human platelets, then redo the computational screening to further
improve SAR. In Aims 2 and 3, traditional medicinal chemistry will then again iteratively improve the properties
of antagonists for potency against the tethered ligand, selectivity and in vivo bioavailability. The best antagonist
of mouse PAR4 will be tested in 5XFAD mice to determine if it can slow or block progression of AD symptoms.
Completion of these aims will result in in vivo tool compounds for determination if antagonism of PAR4 can
arrest or slow the development of AD in this severe animal model of AD."

 The proposed work to clinically test an intracortical visual prosthesis under an FDA-approved Early
Feasibility Study addresses both health and quality-of-life issues because, without some compensatory strategy
for vision loss, over two thirds of individuals with blindness are not gainfully employed, they experience higher
rates of depression and social isolation, and experience a reduced quality-of-life. For the past fifteen years, The
Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) has lead a team-based IntraCortical Visual Prosthesis (ICVP) project,
consisting of multiple institutions and companies, to develop the ICVP Our entry point, for this project, is: the
ICVP is technically and surgically feasible, non-human testing has reached an asymptotic limitation, volunteer
participation in an ICVP trial has a sufficient likelihood of providing sensory, perceptual, and psychological
benefits to warrant human testing, and, that our established ICVP team is prepared to proceed to a first human
clinical trial. The proposed project will use the already well-established project team lead by Dr. Troyk at IIT.
This team is comprised of researchers from seven institutions: Illinois Institute of Technology, University of
Chicago (UC), Johns Hopkins University (JHU), University of Texas, Dallas (UTD), Sigenics, Inc, MicroProbes
for Life Science (MLS), and the Chicago Lighthouse for People who are Blind or Visually Impaired (CLH)."
10883952,"Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a complex, heterogeneous disorder, and risk to AD is influenced
partly by genetics. Understanding the genetic mechanisms that play a role in disease is important
as it can lead to a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms, and can identify
new gene targets for therapeutic development.
We propose gene centric approaches that leverage diverse omics datasets developed specifically
for AD (such as AMP-AD), but also more general resources such as GTEx, PsychENCODE,
ENCODE, and Roadmap Epigenomics. We will develop quantile tools for transcriptome-wide
association studies (TWAS), which are generalizations of TWAS to more complex and
heterogenous scenarios where the linear assumptions in standard TWAS are likely to fail. We will
also develop gene-based tests using data from WGS by jointly analyzing coding and regulatory
variation in predicted regulatory elements likely to affect the expression of a gene under
consideration.
We will implement these analytical tools into software packages to be made freely available to the
community. We will also apply them to some of the largest existing genetic datasets for AD, both
GWAS and WGS, and will make the results available to the community on a specially designed
web portal."
10665704,"Project Summary
ARID1A, encoding a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, is the most frequently mutated
epigenetic regulator across human cancers. Most notably, inactivating mutations in ARID1A occur in ~50% of
ovarian clear cell carcinomas (OCCC) and ~30% of ovarian endometrioid carcinomas (OEC). There is an unmet
need for effective treatment modalities for ARID1A-mutated ovarian cancers. For example, OCCC is generally
refractory to standard agents used to treat epithelial ovarian cancer, and when diagnosed in advanced stages,
OCCC carries the worst prognosis of all ovarian cancer subtypes. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop
a novel therapeutic strategy for ARID1A-mutated ovarian cancers by targeting the IRE1a/XBP1 pathway of the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response alone or in combination with an immune checkpoint blockade. We
show that the ARID1A inactivation creates a dependence on the IRE1a/XBP1 pathway. We also show that
ARID1A inactivation sensitizes ovarian cancer to anti-PD-L1 treatment. The objectives of this application are
to investigate the mechanisms underlying the dependence on the IRE1a/XBP1 pathway created by ARID1A
inactivation and to investigate novel IRE1a/XBP1 inhibition-based therapeutic strategies for ARID1A-mutated
ovarian cancer. Our central hypothesis is that ARID1A-mutated ovarian cancers can be treated and ultimately
eradicated by targeting the IRE1a/XBP1 pathway of the ER stress response alone or in combination with immune
checkpoint blockade. Two Specific Aims are proposed: Aim 1 is to investigate the mechanism by which
ARID1A-mutated ovarian cancer cells are selectively sensitive to the inhibition of the IRE1a/XBP1 pathway; and
Aim 2 will target the IRE1a/XBP1 pathway for developing novel therapeutic strategies for ARID1A mutation. The
proposed studies are highly innovative because they challenge current research/clinical paradigms and utilize
innovative methods to explore new intervention strategies for ARID1A-mutated ovarian cancers. The research
proposed is of high impact because it will provide a scientific rationale for developing urgently needed novel
therapeutic strategies by targeting the IRE1a/XBP1 pathway of the ER stress response alone or in combination
with an immune checkpoint blockade for ARID1A-mutated ovarian cancer, a disease that currently has no
effective therapy. Since ARID1A is the most frequently mutated epigenetic regulator across human cancers, the
mechanistic insights gained from the current studies will have broad implications for many different types of
cancers as well."
10884111,"Summary/Abstract:
High body fat at midlife, as evidenced by overweight or obese body mass index (BMI), is increasingly
understood as a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. However, the underlying processes and mechanisms that
may underlie this risk remains unknown. With this R01 proposal, we request funding to create a new cohort of
cognitively normal 120 midlife individuals, age 40-60 years. We propose to characterize their overweight or
obese status using metabolic tests including, an oral glucose tolerance test, fasting plasma insulin, fasting
plasma glucose, and hemoglobin A1c measurements. This testing will generate categories of metabolically
abnormal overweight or obese (MAOO), metabolically normal overweight or obese, and metabolically normal
lean persons. We will evaluate differences between these groups on neuroimaging with the newer
classification of Alzheimer’s biomarkers with amyloid (A), tau (T), and neurodegeneration (N), or ATN.
Neurodegeneration will be assessed by atrophy on brain MRI as reflected by regional volumes on FreeSurfer.
We will also evaluate MR neuroimaging markers for neuroinflammation using a newer method called diffusion
basis spectrum imaging (DBSI), developed at the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology at Washington University
in St. Louis in collaboration with The Charles F. and Joanne Knight Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center
(Knight ADRC). Recruitment of participants for this study will be done in conjunction with both the Knight
ADRC and the Washington University Center for Human Nutrition. In Aim 1, we hypothesize increased atrophy
in MAOO compared to metabolically normal overweight, obese, and lean participants particularly in regions
important for AD pathology such as the hippocampus and subregions. With Aim 2, we hypothesize a higher
burden of white matter neuroinflammation on DBSI in MAOO compared to other metabolic, overweight or
obese and lean groups. In Aim 3, we hypothesize increased amyloid and tau on brain PET in MAOO versus
other groups. Related sub-aims will examine sex differences in atrophy and neuroinflammation. We will also
investigate sex differences in amyloid and tau deposition across the overweight/obese and lean groups. This
approach is not only of interest given the known sex differences in obesity and AD risk but is also recognized
by the NIA as important in understanding trends of risk in AD. We will also examine the anatomical distribution
of abnormally high body fat by acquiring separate body torso MRI scans at the time of brain MRI scan. This will
allow for separate quantification of visceral, abdominal subcutaneous, and liver fat volumes that we will
separately relate to the imaging markers in Aims 1-3. By understanding how metabolic abnormalities with, and
anatomical distribution of, high body fat relate to brain imaging metrics of ATN and neuroinflammation, we will
contribute key understanding to how obesity increases Alzheimer’s risk. These results will have public health
implications and inform future studies of interventions to reduce risk for Alzheimer’s by identifying important
metrics to utilize for optimization of metabolic and related brain health in overweight and obese persons."
10609962,"Prion diseases are rare, invariably fatal neurodegenerative disorders with pathologic features in
common with Alzheimer’s disease, including extracellular protein aggregates, synaptic loss, and
neuritic dystrophy. In prion and Alzheimer’s disease models, depletion of neuronal cellular prion
protein (PrPC) ameliorates synaptic impairment and clinical disease, strongly implicating
neuronal PrPC expression in the altered signal transduction cascades that may underlie
synaptotoxicity and endolysosomal dysfunction. We have engineered the first knock-in mouse
model with a point mutation in Prnp that develops a striking and severe spongiform
encephalopathy, neuritic dystrophy, and altered post-synaptic receptor phosphorylation, in the
absence of prion aggregates. Cultured cortical neurons from these knock-in mice show an
increased sensitivity to glutamate and dendritic varicosities, suggestive of excitotoxicity. Thus,
this PrP knock-in model provides a unique opportunity to elucidate key PrPC interactions and
altered signal transduction pathways at the synapse and to determine the molecular
mechanisms that link PrPC to synaptic loss and endolysosomal dysregulation. Our long-term
goal is to understand how PrPC triggers aberrant neuronal signaling that may drive impaired
proteostasis and synaptotoxicity in prion disease. Using cultured primary neurons and mice, we
will first determine how the mutant PrPC interactions impact pre- and post-synaptic neuronal
protein levels and glutamate receptor function. We will then identify how mutant PrPC
dysregulates endolysosomal and proteostatic activity. Finally, we use highly sensitive and
quantitative proteomics to define the PrP interactome and phosphoproteome network alterations
in the brain by tandem mass tag mass spectrometry analysis. For all aims, we will directly test
how the findings from the mutant PrPC-expressing brain compare to prion-infected mouse and
human brain. These studies are the first to target the neuronal endolysosomal and synaptic
pathways in a knock-in mouse model expressing mutant PrPC, and outcomes are expected to
provide key insights into the role of PrPC in synapse maintenance and the signaling pathways
inciting synaptic loss, thus revealing new therapeutic targets for prion disease."
10761781,"This proposal represents the renewal of a highly integrated PPG aimed at induction of tolerance to porcine
organs transplanted into primates. We propose to combine two unique tolerance induction platforms, one based
on mixed hematopoietic chimerism and the other on vascularized thymus transplantation. CRISPR/Cas9
technology is used to modify our inbred miniature swine genetically in order to increase the level and duration of
mixed chimerism as well as to enhance organ survival. In Project 1, “Achieving Xenograft Tolerance through
Thymic Programming in Primates”, we will advance the vascularized thymus (VT) approach to kidney xenograft
tolerance toward a clinical trial (Aim 1). In Aim 2, we will attempt to optimize tolerance by combining deletional
and Treg-mediated mechanisms while also tolerizing B cells to the inbred SLAhh GalT KO pig kidney donor. This
tolerance will be achieved by combining the VT transplant approach with mixed xenogeneic chimerism using
optimal GM pigs with intrabone injection (IBBMTx) of pig bone marrow. In Project 2, “Achieving Xenograft
Tolerance through Mixed Chimerism”, Aim 1 will build on our demonstration of greatly prolonged mixed chimerism
in baboons receiving IBBMTx of hCD47 Tg/hCRP Tg/GalT KO pig HCs and evaluate the utility of adding human
cytokine receptor genes to the pig. Aim 2 will build on our observation that expanded recipient baboon Tregs can
prolong mixed porcine chimerism and skin graft survival. We will combine the optimal pig from Aim 1 with optimized
ex-vivo expanded recipient Tregs and IBBMTx to achieve durable chimerism and, with it, tolerance of B cells and
NK cells in addition to T cells. Aim 3 will test whether or not the optimized mixed chimerism approach leads to
tolerance of renal xenografts, including baboons with high pre-formed non-Gal Nab levels, which will receive delayed
donor kidney transplantation. Project 3, “Tolerance of Adaptive and Innate Human Anti-Pig Immune Responses
in Humanized Mice”, builds on our studies of mixed xenogeneic chimerism and porcine thymic transplantation in
human immune system (HIS) mice. In Aim 1, we attempt to achieve optimal tolerance and immune function by
combining mixed chimerism with either hybrid thymic transplantation or pig plus human thymic transplantation,
modeling pig thymic transplantation without human host thymectomy. In Aim 2, we will determine the
mechanisms of T and B cell tolerance via mixed chimerism and thymic transplantation. Both aims utilize unique
TCR transgenic tools. Core A will provide administrative support, coordinating interactions among investigators
and NIH Program staff. Core B will support large animal needs, supplying baboons; coordinating the production,
quality control, phenotyping and genotyping of GM miniature swine; providing swine and baboon CMV assays;
and providing mAbs for all Projects. In Core C, CRISPR/Cas9 will be used to enable the construction of advanced
GM pigs. A Biobank and associated unified database will collect, store and fully describe cell and tissue samples
from all stages of animal production through euthanasia/transplantation. We anticipate that these projects and
cores and their interactions will synergize to provide pivotal advances toward clinical xenotransplantation."
10925169,"Program Summary-Overall
Indian Health Council, Inc. (IHC) with San Diego State University (SDSU) and University of California San
Diego (UCSD), intends to build upon their already existing long-term research partnership in the proposed
projects/studies in the NARCH X application.
The Student Development Program will further expand and refine strategies to recruit students from local
academic institutions into biomedical and behavioral sciences as well as, continue to provide strong mentorship
and guidance for the students in and outside of the region. American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) students
are the least likely of any minoritized group to complete a bachelor’s degree and bachelors, masters, and
doctoral degree attainment has remained the same or decreased since 2000 in both STEM and non-STEM
fields. This is despite AI/AN communities facing some of the largest disparities in health outcomes, thus justifying
a critical need to train more AI/AN health scientists to improve health equity. The CA-NARCH SDP was
established in 2003 and is a partnership between Indian Health Council (IHC), serving 9 regional tribes, and the
academic partners of San Diego State University (SDSU), University of California San Diego (UCSD), California
Sate University- San Marcos (CSUSM), and Palomar Community College (PCC). The CA-NARCH SDP has
significantly addressed gaps in AI/AN academic achievement and has supported 135 students, with 97% being
retained in their STEM programs over its 17 year history. Thus far, 10 students have received a PhD, with 18
additional students currently in PhD programs. 28 students have completed masters degrees, and 15 are currently
in masters programs. Students are dedicated to working in Indian County and 17 students currently have full time
positions in Indian Country; Two students have thus far become faculty members at 4 year universities. The aims
of the CA-NARCH SDP include: 1) Identify and recruit AI/AN students in the biomedical and behavioral sciences
from community college through graduate school into the CA-NARCH SDP program; 2) Retain AI/AN students
in their respective higher education programs and develop and enhance their knowledge, skills, science-self
efficacy, and persistence to succeed in STEM programs to successfully matriculate into graduate programs; 3)
Engage and provide training for AI/AN students in biomedical and health research to increase their
competitiveness for jobs/graduate school and their likelihood of becoming health/science researchers; 4) Increase
the cultural interface and competencies of the CA-NARCH students and encourage AI/AN community
engagement and trust in research. Centered at IHC, the CA-NARCH SDP has established infrastructure with a
SDP team, including a full-time native coordinator (Luiseño), and an established presence and leads on the 4
surrounding campuses. Students are recruited from the 4 campuses, AI/AN organizations, faculty directors of NIH
and NSD funded science enrichment programs, and from local tribes. Retention methods are multiple and include
engaging students in research through existing NIH and NSF funded program, the CA-NARCH Directed Research
(CANDR) program with campus and community based research, and in summer and yearlong research programs.
Students receive continual mentorship from the CA NARCH SDP team, develop individual development plans,
and will be assigned a cultural mentor who will provide additional guidance to students. Students will all
participate in workshops and seminars that will enhance their science skills, provide training in indigenous
research methods and that will expose students to established AI/AN researchers working in AI/AN communities.
Cultural interface and community trust in research is enhanced by CA-NARCH SDP team and student
presentations at community events and through cultural days. Evaluation of the program includes quantitative and
qualitative measures and serves to assess program success and enhancement.
 Lastly, the Administrative Core will function as administrative support for the student project and individual
research studies by providing training through the Tribal IRB, providing/dispersing information on resources and
mentoring opportunities, and guidance in evaluation planning."
10883891,"PROJECT SUMMARY.
 One in three older adults exhibits some form of cognitive deficit, with 13% of individuals over age 65 meeting
the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Even in the absence of overt pathology, age-related cognitive
dysfunction can be sufficiently severe as to disrupt instrumental activities of daily living and, consequently, the
ability to maintain personal independence. In aging and AD, mnemonic functions supported by the hippocampus
(HPC) and executive functions supported by the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are particularly vulnerable to decline.
Both HPC and PFC undergo molecular and electrophysiological alterations with age that perturb the balance
between excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) signaling necessary for optimal cognition. In addition, aberrant E/I
signaling in aging increases susceptibility to AD neuropathology. Moreover, age-associated increases in
peripheral inflammation can dysregulate E/I signaling, exacerbate AD pathology, and impair cognition. An ideal
intervention for improving cognitive outcomes in aging would thus: 1) benefit multiple aspects of cognitive
function with minimal side effects, 2) act to re-establish E/I homeostasis across the aged brain, 3) attenuate the
accumulation of AD pathology that can worsen cognitive dysfunction, and 4) be readily translated across species.
 Electrical vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has been used safely and effectively for 30 years to treat epilepsy
and depression, and published and preliminary data show that it positively influences central nervous system E/I
signaling. VNS also reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines in the periphery, as well as tau levels in AD patients.
Most importantly, data in both animal and human subjects show that VNS enhances multiple forms of PFC- and
HPC-dependent cognition that are compromised in aging. Despite these promising findings, VNS has not been
rigorously evaluated as a potential treatment for age-associated cognitive decline. The objective of this proposal
is to determine if chronic VNS mitigates deleterious neurobiological and inflammatory consequences of aging
and improves cognitive function in aged subjects. Our rationale is that such studies will provide a foundation for
use of VNS as a treatment for cognitive impairments in aging. Our overarching hypothesis is that chronic VNS
will benefit cognition in aging by restoring E/I homeostasis, reducing inflammation, and protecting against AD-
associated pathology. Aim 1 will determine whether VNS normalizes molecular and electrophysiological
signatures of E/I dysregulation and reduces peripheral markers of inflammation in aging. Aim 2 will determine
whether VNS remediates multiple forms of age-associated cognitive impairment. Aim 3 will use a targeted AAV-
based approach to determine whether VNS protects against neuropathology and cognitive decline associated
with AD-like tau pathology. These experiments will be significant as they will help to determine the utility of VNS
as an intervention for treating cognitive decline in aging and AD."
10891792,"Project Summary
Aging is the major risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), with changes in the aging
nervous system contributing to AD pathology. The major goal of this proposal is to develop
novel approaches to counteract neuronal aging phenotypes, prolong healthy lifespan and delay
the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s disease. In recent years, loss of intestinal barrier
function has emerged as an evolutionarily conserved pathophysiological hallmark of aging.
Importantly, studies in model organisms, including mice and Drosophila, have revealed that
directly targeting intestinal barrier integrity can mediate healthy lifespan at the organismal level.
However, fundamental questions remain regarding the relationships between intestinal barrier
dysfunction and aging of distal organ systems. Indeed, little is known regarding the causal
relationships between intestinal barrier dysfunction, neuronal aging and AD.
Alterations in the actin filament network have been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease
and related dementias, but the role of neuronal actin dynamics in aging and lifespan
determination has not been characterized. In preliminary work, we have discovered that aging
and age-onset intestinal barrier dysfunction are associated with the accumulation of
filamentous actin (F-actin) and actin-rich rods in aged brains. Furthermore, we have discovered
that targeted, neuron-specific interventions that reduce the hyper stabilization of F-actin in the
aging brain, improve cellular markers of aging and dramatically prolong healthy lifespan. These
findings provide an important first step towards understanding the mechanistic interplay
between neuronal actin dynamics, AD-related neurotoxicity and organismal health during aging.
Here, we propose to build upon these groundbreaking findings by exploring three broad
questions:
1) What are the mechanistic relationships between intestinal barrier dysfunction and
actin dynamics in the aging brain?
2) Can modulating neuronal actin dynamics in aged animals improve neuronal function,
healthy longevity and/or counteract AD pathogenesis?
3) What are the mechanistic relationships between actin dynamics in the aging brain and
other cellular hallmarks of aging; loss of proteostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction?
 The work described herein will bring about fundamental knowledge towards our
understanding of the mechanisms of aging and AD-related pathology. Our findings may also
lead to novel therapeutic approaches to counteract aging, AD and related dementias."
10228542,"Treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) for stroke prevention and recovery represents a rare chance to
achieve transformative impact on post-stroke care and outcomes. OSA is highly prevalent after stroke (~75%)
and is a known risk factor for poor functional outcome, mortality, and recurrent stroke. Furthermore, OSA is
readily treated by a safe, simple, and relatively low-cost therapy, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).
Observational studies have already demonstrated better stroke outcomes among patients who use CPAP, and
multiple pilot trials have hinted at the benefits of CPAP after stroke. These studies have laid the foundation for
a definitive trial on the role of CPAP in post-stroke management. The pressing need for this critical next step is
highlighted in the latest American Stroke Association secondary stroke prevention guidelines. Therefore, the
investigators now propose a phase III, open-label, blinded-endpoint assessment, multicenter, randomized,
controlled trial to determine (1) whether treatment of OSA with CPAP after acute ischemic stroke or high-risk
transient ischemic attack (TIA) helps to prevent recurrent stroke, acute coronary syndrome, and all-cause
mortality 6 months after the event, and (2) whether treatment of OSA shortly after acute ischemic stroke
improves stroke outcomes at 3 months. This study capitalizes on an efficient and cost-saving design involving
a 6-month prevention trial with an embedded 3-month recovery trial. Many years of pilot work have identified
the challenges related to the diagnosis and treatment of OSA after stroke. These valuable insights - combined
with innovative digital and biomedical technology - have contributed to this highly pragmatic trial in which
feasibility is paramount. In particular, as polysomnography and CPAP titration are seldom tolerated just after
acute stroke, OSA will be identified through use of a portable cardiopulmonary sleep apnea test, and treated
with an automatically adjusting CPAP device. Through state-of-the-art methods, subjects will receive
centralized, real-time, nightly monitoring of CPAP use and proactive care management to maximize CPAP
adherence. This approach simplifies and streamlines the diagnosis and treatment of OSA, which will facilitate
implementation in hospitals with low resources. Consequently, this trial provides StrokeNet with an opportunity
to use its network more fully, and will permit positive trial results to be readily translated into community
settings across the U.S. This study represents a rare opportunity to change post-stroke care in a fundamental
manner with a safe, cost-effective intervention that could improve both recovery and prevention in a substantial
proportion of patients."
10891794,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Depression has an enormous impact: it is the leading cause of disability worldwide and affects more than 264
million people of all ages. Moreover, major depression at any age doubles the risk of Alzheimer’s Disease and
related dementias, which affect over 50 million people worldwide — a number projected to triple by 2050.
Interventions for depression in older adults have limited efficacy to date, and directly treating cognitive
impairment and/or Alzheimer’s Disease is not feasible or effective. Thus, identifying modifiable risk factors that
favorably influence both depression and cognition before dementia onset is an urgent public health need. Sleep
is one such risk factor. However, sleep is not a uni-dimensional construct represented by merely its duration or
the presence/absence of a sleep disorder. Rather sleep is multidimensional: it is comprised of multiple domains
(e.g., Regularity, Satisfaction, Sleepiness, Timing, Efficiency, Duration) and measured on multiple levels (e.g.
self-report or behavioral [via actigraphy]). In our initial R01, we leveraged our biostatistical and sleep expertise
to develop and hone methods for examining multidimensional sleep health as a predictor of mortality in a high-
dimensional machine learning (ML) context that flexibly accounts for the complex interactions that exist among
sleep and non-sleep risk factors. We now seek to build on the success of the initial funding period by using our
novel methods to examine multidimensional sleep health as a predictor of changes in cognition and depressive
symptoms. To enhance generalizability and power, we are developing a Pooled Sample of N~3,400 adults aged
≥65 without cognitive impairment from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study, Study of Osteoporotic Fractures,
Memory and Aging Project (MAP) and Minority Aging Research Study (MARS). With these methods and data,
we will examine multidimensional sleep health for predicting changes in global cognition and incident dementia
(Aim 1) and depressive symptoms (Aim 2) in a high-dimensional machine learning context. We will also examine
depression as a pathway through which multidimensional sleep health predicts impaired cognition (Aim 3). Our
Secondary Aims are to: (a) apply parallel methods in two additional cohorts (the Rotterdam Study and Multi-
Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) to replicate and extend our findings to cohorts with different demographic
profiles and clinical Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias diagnoses; (b) examine effects by sex and race;
and (c) identify the sleep health characteristics driving overall effects. Identifying multidimensional sleep health
profiles that reliably predict changes in global cognition, incident dementia, and changes in depressive symptoms
in a realistic, high dimensional context will directly inform the design of novel targeted interventions and
prospective studies focused on preventing Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias. Moreover, we will amplify
the impact of our work by demonstrating new methods for studying health and depositing harmonized data on
the National Sleep Research Resource to facilitate future multi-cohort secondary analyses."
10914146,"OVERALL: ABSTRACT
The number of American Indians aged 65 and older is expected to triple to 1,624,000 by 2050, while the number
of those aged 85 and older will increase 7-fold to 300,000. While welcome, these statistics raise concerns about
proportionate increases in health conditions associated with aging – especially Alzheimer’s disease and related
dementias. This worrisome confluence of population growth, emerging needs, and high risk, combined with the
widely recognized limitations of available health data on American Indian elders, motivates us to propose the
Wabanaki Native American Research Center for Health, a partnership between Wabanaki Public Health and the
Institute for Research and Education to Advance Community Health at Washington State University. Wabanaki
Public Health is a tribal public health district serving the 4 federally recognized tribes of Maine. Collectively known
as the Wabanaki tribes, the tribes include the Aroostook Band of Micmacs, Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians,
Penobscot Nation, and Passamaquoddy Tribe. Establishing the Wabanaki Native American Research Center
for Health to address elder health is critically important for 3 reasons. First, elder health is a high priority for
Wabanaki Public Health. Second, Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias and mild cognitive impairment are
leading causes of morbidity and mortality, yet nothing is known about the prevalence of these conditions or their
economic impact among American Indians in the northeastern US. Third, Wabanaki Public Health desires to
strengthen its research capacity and infrastructure as a necessary foundation for sustainable research.
Therefore, our overall Specific Aims are to: 1) Strengthen collaborations between Wabanaki Public Health, a
public health district serving American Indians people in Maine and Washington State University to improve the
research and service capacities of Wabanaki Public Health through 1 Research Project, 2 Capacity Building
Projects, and an Administrative Core; 2) Estimate the prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia
and mild cognitive impairment among Wabanaki tribal members aged 55 and older, as well as the current and
future direct and indirect costs associated with these conditions; 3) Build research capacity among Wabanaki
Public Health staff and Wabanaki undergraduate students through a year-long tailored research methods course
and year-long student internships at Wabanaki Public Health; and 4) Extend tribal self-governance to encompass
the regulation of scientific endeavors and to build research capacity by laying the foundation for a Research
Review Board. The Wabanaki NARCH is the first in the northeastern US since the program was founded in
2000. It will fill striking gaps in our knowledge of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias and mild cognitive
impairment among American Indian elders. It will also promote and expand the research and infrastructure
capabilities of Wabanaki Public Health, a tribal public health district that is uniquely positioned to assume a
leadership role in ameliorating health disparities experienced by Wabanaki and other northeastern tribal
communities."

 This Great Lakes Native American Research Centers for Health (GLNARCH) application aligns
established partnerships to generate a network of resources for AI/AN programs as well as support ongoing
successful initiatives. We have identified opportunities to establish synergistic education, training, and research
within the Indian Health Service Bemidji Region with increased focus on including Tribal Colleges and
Universities (TCU). This application proposes an unprecedented endeavor to engage AI/AN populations in
cultivating an indigenized (culturally responsive) research and training agenda. This agenda will follow the
common AI/AN cultural theme of holistic health and wellness connected to the land and the unique natural
resources of the Great Lakes region. The Student Career Enhancement Project (SCEP) proposes exciting
opportunities to expose AI/AN students to remote learning, thereby connecting them in an indigenous styled
network whilst also preparing them for 21st century education. The Capacity Building Project is responsive to
recent experiences and evaluation reports to seek even better research networks and resource sharing within
the GLNARCH service area, which is geographically broad and underfunded. The Capacity Building Project
proposes unique initiatives to better engage TCUs via the established and successful Native American
Environmental Health Research (NEHR) network. Leveraging modern technology will increase both research
and training capacity in the tribal community and academic spheres. The proposed team has successfully
implemented over 16 years of successful and impactful GLNARCH programming. They possess the necessary
skills, institutional environment, and connections to execute these aims."
10795725,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Mutations in the Presenilin (PSEN) genes account for ~90% of all causative mutations in familial
Alzheimer's disease (FAD). During the last two decades, our large numbers of genetic studies using conditional
knockout and knockin mice have demonstrated that Presenilin (PS) is essential for learning and memory,
synaptic function and neuronal survival, and that PSEN1 mutations cause loss of its essential function and g-
secretase activity. Our genetic findings are further supported by cell culture and biochemical studies showing
that ~90% of PSEN1 mutations cause loss of g-secretase activity. In this renewal application (YEARS 20-24),
we propose to extend our successful PS studies to the development of novel therapies for FAD. Specifically, we
will perform preclinical studies using recombinant adeno-associated virus to deliver wild-type human PS1 (hPS1)
to PS mutant mouse brains and then determine whether hPS1 rescues impaired g-secretase activity,
neurodegeneration, synaptic and memory deficits caused by PS mutations (Aim 1). The amyloid precursor
protein (APP) was the first protein associated with sporadic AD, and the APP V717I mutation was the first FAD
mutation identified. The genetic link of APP mutations to FAD and the presence of amyloid plaques in sporadic
AD brains highlight the importance of APP in AD pathogenesis. Despite its importance, APP normal function in
the cerebral cortex remains unclear due to genetic redundancy of its family members, APLP1 and APLP2, and
perinatal lethality of APP/APLP1/APLP2 triple knockout mice. We therefore propose to investigate the normal
physiological role of APP family through the generation and multidisciplinary analysis of APP/APLP1/APLP2
conditional triple knockout mice, in which all APP family members are selectively inactivated in excitatory or
inhibitory neurons of the cerebral cortex (Aim 2). Despite the abundance of APP, APLP1 and APLP2 in excitatory
neurons of the cerebral cortex, their inactivation does not lead to early lethality, loss of cortical neurons or

APP family regulates hippocampal local circuits. The completion of the proposed study will provide preclinical

excitability and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal network."
10914792,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Aaniiih and Nakoda Tribes of the Fort Belknap Reservation have established a trusting research
partnership with the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing and look forward to the expansion of this partnership
through the NARCH XI proposal. This proposal will allow us to work toward a future in which health disparities
are eliminated on the Fort Belknap Reservation. The overall goals of the NARCH XI proposal are threefold: (1)
train Aaniiih and Nakoda NARCH scholars to reduce health disparities and promote wellness through
academic opportunities, public health and research training, and research field experiences; (2) build research
capacity through two community-based research projects to address priority health concerns; and (3) build
factors which promote resiliency across all NARCH trainings and interventions. We will address these aims
through three projects: (1) the Aaniiih and Nakoda Student, Tribal Health Leader, Faculty, and Nurse Training
Program, which will advance research and behavioral health provider capacity while developing a pathway for
success of future Aaniiih and Nakoda nurses, researchers, and healthcare providers at Fort Belknap; (2)
Improving Suicide and Suicide Cluster Prevention in High-Risk Remote Reservation Settings research project;
and (3) Adapt and evaluate an evidence- and technology-based safety planning intervention, myPlan app, to
improve the safety and health of Native American adolescents in rural settings research project. The research
projects will provide applied training opportunities for Aaniiih and Nakoda NARCH scholars from high school, to
graduate, and to tribal health leaders. The projects have been designed to facilitate collaboration and learning
across projects, with the goal of increasing research and training capacity, understanding risks and protective
factors against suicide, and helping our youth establish safe, healthy relationships. These research projects
were determined based on Fort Belknap Tribal Council priorities and through the input of community
stakeholders. Two Tribal Advisory Boards (TAB) will guide and oversee all projects over the course of the
projects. Community-based participatory research methods will be utilized for all projects; our team believes
that community leadership is essential to the success of the proposed projects and continued development and
sustainability of research and training in the Fort Belknap Community."

Chromosome segregation is precisely controlled to ensure that daughter cells receive the correct number of
chromosomes. Cell cycle checkpoints play an important role in this regulation by monitoring chromosome
behavior and delaying or arresting the cell cycle to correct errors. Despite being characterized almost
exclusively in single cells, the functions of cell cycle checkpoints are perhaps most critical in multicellular
organisms, where chromosomal abnormailities can produce cancer, infertility, miscarriages and birth defects.
As multicellular organisms develop, cells undergo dramatic changes in size, shape, fate, chromosome
structure and cell cycle duration. How the function of cell cycle checkpoints is coordinated with and modulated
by these changes in cellular context are unknown.
We have shown that checkpoint proteins in one biological context can monitor and regulate radically different
chromosome behaviors in a different biological context. By analyzing the function and regulation of essential
checkpoint factors in cells that vary in size, shape, fate, and tissue in C. elegans, we will identify mechanisms,
both common and unique, that guarantee that chromosomes segregate properly in all cell types.
Fundamentally, our future work is focused on addressing two major questions: Does the function of checkpoint
proteins vary depending on their biological context, such that the same proteins appear to have dramatically
different roles? Or are there common fundamental mechanisms that monitor diverse chromosome behaviors to
produce functionally different checkpoint responses?"
11070425,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This new R01 application entitled “Understanding bone mass in Down Syndrome” is focused on determining
the cellular mechanism for the low bone turnover we have identified in people and mice with Down Syndrome
(DS), and on characterizing fracture healing responses in different DS mouse models to gain insight into how
to better target fracture healing in the DS population with increased propensity to fracture. This proposal will
determine the contribution of Regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1) that impacts both NF-κB activity in
osteoclasts and Wnt signaling in osteoblasts/osteocytes to the inherently low bone mineral density (BMD) in
DS. The proposed experiments will also determine the impact of cessation of the current clinical bone anabolic
interventions in the setting of DS as well as define DS fracture healing. Aim 1 will elucidate the pathways
through which RCAN1 controls osteoclast and osteoblast differentiation and function. Aim 2 will provide the
first direct evidence of fracture healing and repair in the context of low bone accrual and DS. Aim 3 will
determine the effects of discontinuation of current pharmaceutical anabolic therapies (anti-sclerostin antibody
and intermittent PTH) on bone mass accrual in three preclinical mouse models of DS. The successful
completion of this study will lead to a paradigm shift in our understanding of the DS bone phenotype and a new
landscape of high-quality research that will provide clarification of the mechanisms that contribute to the low
bone mass in DS and more importantly, provide the basis for new directions for the treatment of the fractures
and profound osteopenia that affects this population."

As promises to ensure the health of American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) people in the United States
continue to be broken, we propose our Northwest Indian College (NWIC) NARCH XI application as a hedge
against the rising tide of racial inequity and social injustice impacting the lives and ultimately the health and
mortality of the Indigenous people in this nation. The etiology of AIAN health disparities is complex and
includes social, biological, economic, cultural, and historical factors contributing to health risks and poorer
health outcomes among AIANs that are related to structural and racial inequities and racial trauma. Gains have
been made in AIAN health promotion and effective practice, but advances are not happening quickly enough
and lives are being lost to preventable and treatable diseases and conditions. Research has certainly not
always been viewed by AIAN people and tribes as a key part of a healing journey, but over the last two
decades, tribes, tribal organizations and tribal community members in the US have begun to emerge as
leaders of their own self-determined research agendas to address health priorities and eliminate
disparities and inequities. AIAN communities and tribal organizations in Washington state have been
leading research efforts to address health disparities and racial inequities in health care through
partnerships with research intensive universities and with AIAN investigators positioned at these sites.
The Northwest Indian College (NWIC) is the only accredited tribal college serving the states of
Washington, Oregon and Idaho, and has an established history of partnering to conduct tribally owned
and controlled research. NWIC has an active NARCH program that focuses on addressing the opioid
public health crisis in Coast Salish communities through recovery factors research. The proposed NWIC
NARCH XI has the goals to expand capacity at NWIC to allow more rapid and real-time response to tribal
council and AIAN community requests to conduct research in emergent, high priority areas including
addressing the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis on health, resilience and recovery.
Overall, this proposed NARCH XI application aims to support three tribally-led research projects that
address high priority health issues identified by AIAN tribes or tribal organizations, and provide
opportunities for AIAN student health careers development and research training."
10899543,"OVERALL CENTER PROJECT SUMMARY
The proposed Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM) Cooperative Center of Excellence in Hematology
(CCEH) brings together 25 investigators whose research activities are focused on various aspects of
nonmalignant hematology and whose work is highly dependent on one or more of the three biomedical
research cores proposed in this application. The central theme of our CCEH is the regulation of human and
murine hematopoiesis at the level of hematopoietic stem (HSC) and progenitor (HPC) cells. The goal of the
investigations of members of this center is to leverage different components of the hematopoietic system to
improve the advancement of the clinical utility and efficacy of HSC/HPC-based therapies. We believe that in
order to attain these goals, we must understand basic biological processes that affect hematopoietic stem cell
behavior both in vitro and in vivo in a basic science laboratory and to eventually establish clinical trials that
transform these findings into translational efforts. The proposed CCEH membership in this application draws
from a group of very productive, well-funded and team-oriented investigators with a diverse but complementary
experience in hematopoiesis. These experiences include experimental and clinical stem cell transplantation,
signaling in and regulation of HSC and HPC, interactions between HSC and the hematopoietic niche,
mobilization, homing and engraftment of HSC, modulation of function of freshly isolated cells under different O2
levels, and functional status of HSC after exposure to ionizing radiation. The cores proposed in this CCEH
submission evolved from existing shared facilities or cores previously established during the prior funding
period and were tailored specifically to meet the current research needs of CCEH members and the general
research community nationwide. These include: Experimental Mouse Resources, Flow and Tissue Cytometry,
and Hypoxia cores. All cores will support the basic and translational studies that underlie the mission of our
CCEH and the community of nonmalignant hematology research at large. These cores will facilitate the
development of new discoveries into human trials. Furthermore, to ensure continued scientific growth and
progress, the proposed center has a well-developed Enrichment Program to advance the development of both
young and established CCEH members inside and outside IUSM. Our goal is to establish, maintain, and
successfully operate these three state-of-the-art biomedical core facilities and to provide a supportive and
enriching environment to foster the growth and development of young and new investigators in nonmalignant
hematology. As proposed, the CCEH represents an important assembly of critical cores, infrastructure, and
investigators needed to promote and enhance the basic and clinical work in progress in nonmalignant
hematology and to provide support that we believe is needed over the next five years."

Project Summary
Vivreon Biosciences is pleased to apply for NCI SBIR Solicitation PA-21-259. Vivreon is an innovative life
sciences company that is developing a novel small molecule Ca2+ channel inhibitor, VV2003, to improve
outcomes in persons undergoing immune checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy. Checkpoint inhibitors have
improved overall survival in numerous cancers, but enterocolitis has emerged as the most frequent dose-limiting
toxicity associated with these therapies. Checkpoint inhibitor-induced colitis is currently treated with
immunosuppressive therapy, which blunts the tumor-killing potential of the checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy
and is administered following checkpoint therapy discontinuation. VV2003 is an oral candidate therapeutic
designed to selectively and safely block checkpoint inhibitor-induced enterocolitis without systemic
immunosuppressive side effects. It is intended to be used concomitantly with checkpoint inhibitors, allowing
immunotherapy to continue, separating it from other investigational therapies.
Vivreon seeks NCI Phase 2 funding for investigational new drug (IND)-enabling good laboratory practice (GLP)

Comprehensive Cancer Center (RP) led by the RP Center for Indigenous Cancer Research (RP-
CICR) in Buffalo, NY. Establishing the ARCH will support the development of two research
projects and one student enhancement project, all co-developed and co-led by SRMT and RP.
The proposed Administrative Core will establish key personnel, supplies, and in-person or virtual
meetings to coordinate project timelines, deliverables, evaluation efforts, and community
engagement. The Environmental Health Research Project will engage RP environmental
scientists and state-of-the-art equipment to measure environmental health concerns in

titled, LIVE (Live, Indigenous, Virtual, Enhancement), includes a culturally tailored liver health
promotion program to encourage traditional and healthy life ways through community-based
education and lifestyle modification. To support research interest amongst the younger generation
in Akwesasne, the ARCH proposal includes the St. Regis Mohawk Research Scholars Program.
This program engages high school and college students in a three-prong approach, 1.)
Community Engagement Conferences to create research and science career awareness and
recruit students to participate in afterschool and summer research opportunities; 2.) An After
School Health Science Club to provide students with working knowledge of public health, data
collection methods, statistical analysis approaches, health behavior and epidemiology principles;
and 3.) a Summer Program to provide high school and college students with immersive research
experiences integrated with core research projects of ARCH, and to apply principles and skill sets
to addressing cancer health disparities and environmental health issues specific to the SRMT.
Each project in the ARCH would be directed by the Principal Investigator from the SRMT Health
Division and coordinated by key personnel identified both at SRMT and RP's Center for
Indigenous Cancer Research. This direct partnership with the SRMT Health Division supports
RP's existing Memorandum of Understanding with the Indian Health Service that agrees to

10899758,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - Overall
The theme of this CCEH is focused on stem cell and transplantation biology. The aims are designed to
overcome obstacles that prevent new investigators from joining this field. Specifically the four cores will
provide investigators access to: Large numbers of human and canine stem/progenitor cells; Scalable viral
production services for AAV, gamma-, lenti- and foamy viruses; Products for precision gene editing and
functional genetic manipulation; PCR assays for tracking chimerism, and insertion sites; Xenografting to
assess human hematopoiesis; Large animal model for preclinical in vivo testing and disease modeling.
The major goal of this CCEH is to make these services available throughout the US. For this purpose,
products and services must be cost- effective and of high quality. Also training in best practices for the use
of these resources is imperative. Towards this goal core staff provide on-site training: funds to support travel
to attend training sessions are available. In addition, standard operating procedures (SOP) and quality
control measures (QC) for all processes and products are shared on our website where they can be
discussed and amended as the science evolves.
The logistics of distributing products throughout the country are challenging. However, since the first
iteration of this grant (P30 DK056465) in 1999 we have successfully shipped highly purified CD34 cells in
liquid nitrogen to hundreds of satisfied investigators. Our costs are generally less than 1/3 of the cheapest
commercial vender, and our product is better. Logistics for shipping other biological products to out of state
users are already in place.
The fees for service charged by this CCEH generates program income of $1-2 million per year. These funds
are used to increase staff, develop new technologies and to fund the Enrichment Program. The goal is to
help build a strong, diverse, interactive hematology research community. Included in this effort is a research
internship program for students from underrepresented or underserved populations.
The Seattle CCEH research base consists of 25 faculty members at the University of Washington and/or the
Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Currently our research base brings in $17,130,946 in direct costs
per year for studies in non-malignant hematopoiesis."
10883934,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Neurodegeneration markers (N markers) are associated with cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD)
and related dementias. Since they are more proximally related to cognitive decline than AD-specific biomarkers
(amyloid and tau measures), they have been proposed as surrogate endpoints in clinical trials and even for
prognosis in the clinical setting. Despite the promise of N markers, several barriers to their implementation
exist. The major limitations include i) only validation in convenience samples that exclude those with significant
cerebrovascular disease rather than the general population, ii) lack of systematic comparison of the frequently
used N markers across modalities (i.e., imaging, CSF, blood) to predict cognitive outcomes at varying levels of
AD and cerebrovascular disease pathology, and iii) lack of understanding of the pathological profile associated
with each N marker. In the current application, our overall goal is to understand the unique information each N
marker (imaging, CSF, blood) provides with regards to cognitive decline and underlying pathology to optimize
their use in clinical practice and clinical trials. We will utilize the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) a
longitudinal population-based study where participants undergo psychometric, neurologic, and neuroimaging
investigations (MRI, amyloid and tau PET, FDG PET), and blood draws; a subset also have CSF and/or post-
mortem data as the primary dataset for this grant. In Aim 1, we will compare N markers from neuroimaging,
CSF, and blood in MCSA in relation to demographics (including socioeconomic status), in vivo AD (amyloid
and tau PET) and cerebrovascular disease biomarkers, and cognition. We will validate some of these
relationships in a biracial Mayo Clinic Jacksonville sample and in ADNI. In Aim 2, we will conduct an ante-
mortem N marker – post-mortem validation study to determine the pathological profiles associated with (each
and combination of) N markers. The findings of the grant will lead to better understanding of N markers
associated with longitudinal cognitive decline and the pathologies associated these N markers. This knowledge
will inform clinical trial design and guidance of which N marker(s) to choose for future clinical use for AD and
ADRD."
10883954,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Our recent discovery of orally brain permeable small molecules that mimic the bioactivity of Humanin (HN)
peptide to enhance and normalize neuronal phospho-Akt (p-Akt) levels provides a unique opportunity for
evaluating this new approach in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this proposal, we will direct our efforts to
optimize this new class of agents, focusing on screening additional hits, enhancing their potency, drug-like
properties, solubility, oral brain permeability and efficacy in an AD model towards development of this novel
therapeutic approach for AD. We will also use modeling to identify HN based peptidomimetics for testing. Our
data show that these small molecule HN mimetics, like HN, can suppress neuronal death through its activation
of the gp130 receptor and signaling via the PI3/Akt pathway and provide neuroprotection for primary
hippocampal neurons against N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) and Aβ-induced neurotoxicity. HN is a naturally
occurring mitochondrial-derived brain peptide that decreases with age and may act as a neuroprotective factor
against AD-relevant neurotoxicity. Treatment of hippocampal neurons with our HN mimetic compound 2
resulted in an increase in p-Akt, and this correlated to its observed neuroprotective effects. In AD patients, a
significant decrease in p-Akt has been reported. Similarly, in aged apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) mice, there is a
significant decrease in p-Akt in the brain relative to age-matched ApoE3 mice suggesting that PI3/Akt signaling
is affected by ApoE4, a risk factor in AD. Activation of PI3/Akt signaling can transcriptionally modulate genes
related to memory such as choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT)
and may also regulate postsynaptic proteins involved in neuroplasticity. AD is the most prevalent age-related
dementia, currently afflicting more than 5.4 million people in the US. Given the urgent need for new
therapeutic approaches for AD, these HN mimetics could provide promising lead candidates for therapeutic
development. In Aim 1, we plan to evaluate small molecule HN mimetics and peptidomimetics for activation of
gp130 and normalization of p-Akt along with their neuroprotection against Aβ and NMDA induced neurotoxicity.
In Aim 2, we would conduct a design and synthesis campaign using current SAR and new docking/modeling
data to identify small mimetics, peptides and peptidomimetics. We will optimize potency, drug-like properties,
solubility and oral brain bioavailability for efficacy testing. The best analogs/peptidomimetics from Aims 1 and 2
will undergo in vitro ADMET profiling and pharmacokinetic (PK) studies, along with phosphoproteomics
analyses, in Aim 3 to prioritize the optimal compounds for in vivo efficacy testing in the ApoE4(TR):5XFAD
murine model of AD as part of Aim 4. The goal is to identify orally available HN-mimetics that
enhance/normalize brain p-Akt levels and improve cognition. Like HN itself, they could also have broader
therapeutic applications in traumatic brain injury (TBI), stroke, Aβ-induced cerebrovascular dementia,
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and could lead to a new class of preclinical candidates for AD."
10795724,"Summary
Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is a debilitating disease with aggregates of tau protein in multiple brain
areas and severe mental and motor deficits. PSP is often misdiagnosed as Parkinson's Disease (rate of 50%)
and there are no drugs that help PSP sufferers. Those with PSP have a life expectancy of only 6-8 years,
suggestive that the neurodegeneration is already far advanced when symptomology becomes evident.
Therefore, there is a need to i) increase the accuracy of diagnosis, ii) find biomarkers or behavioral deficits that
predate the symptoms, and iii) find therapeutics. To facilitate these goals, we need to understand 1) from
where within the brain does the disease originate, 2) which neural pathways when degenerated produce which
symptoms, and 3) the topographical progression of pathogenesis. Based on strong preliminary data, we
propose that the accumulation of tau protein in cholinergic pedunculopontine tegmentum (PPT) neurons in the
hindbrain will produce tau aggregates in brain regions impacted in PSP, progress from a disease-free state to
a PSP-like end stage, and produce PSP-like behavioral deficits (e.g. dysexecutive frontal syndrome and motor
deficits).
To produce PSP-like pathology in rats we use a genetically engineered virus to selectively over-express the
isoform of the tau protein that predominates in PSP (1N4R) in cholinergic PPT neurons. At 5 months post-
infection, the model is consistent with PSP: i) a loss of cholinergic neurons, ii) loss of substantia nigra
dopaminergic neurons, iii) increased number of hyperphosphorylated tau-positive neurons, iv) acoustic startle
reflex deficit, and v) motor deficits. Animals with tau protein over-expression will be compared to those that
have the over-expression of a benign protein at 5 month intervals until old age. We will complete extensive
postmortem histochemical analysis, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), REM sleep recordings, and
behavioral testing (e.g. cognitive & motor) to establish whether the pathology progresses to a condition
consistent with late-stage PSP.
Once it is established that accumulation of tau in the cholinergic PPT neurons is sufficient to produce late
stage PSP-like pathology and behavior deficits, future work would include: 1) identifying strategies that
ameliorate symptomology and disease progression, 2) the discovery of early markers of disease onset, and 3)
molecular mechanistic studies (e.g. knockdown of specific targets)."
10883918,"Project Summary/Abstract
The first change in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients and the best biomarker of the disease is synaptic loss.
Several studies have shown that PSD-95 (a major scaffolding protein at the synapse) is significantly depleted
in brain tissue of Alzheimer’s patients as well as in neurons exposed to amyloid beta (Aβ, a peptide thought
to cause Alzheimer’s disease (AD)). Our data indicate that elevated PSD-95 blocks Aβ-induced synaptic
depression. Surprisingly, this effect appears independent of synaptic potentiation, but to interference by PSD-
95 of NMDA receptor signaling. Moreover, we observed that big dendritic spines, containing a lot of PSD-95,
were unaffected by Aβ and that smaller spines, with lower amounts of PSD-95 were more vulnerable;
suggesting that endogenous PSD-95 is also protective. These findings indicate that increased synaptic PSD-
95 protects synapses from Aβ. The amount of synaptic PSD-95 is controlled by a process called
‘palmitoylation’ which mediate the insertion of PSD-95 in post-synaptic membranes. The specific enzyme
responsible for PSD-95 depalmitoylation, which removes PSD-95 from synapses, was recently identified. The
key focus of this proposal is thus to test the potential of a novel drug target, PSD-95 depalmitoylating
enzyme, as a new therapeutic avenue against Alzheimer’s. Our preliminary in vitro and in vivo results, using
a commercially available inhibitor of that enzyme (Palmostatin B), are very promising. In vitro experiments
showed that this drug could rescue Aβ-induced synaptic depression and Aβ-mediated effects on dendritic
spines. We propose to study PSD-95 palmitoylation in brain regions differently affected in the disease in AD
model mice (APP/PS1) and postmortem human brain samples. These experiments could explain why certain
brain regions (and individuals) are more vulnerable to AD. In APP/PS1 mice, PSD-95 palmitoylation in the
hippocampus was drastically lower than in WT littermates while total PSD-95 levels were barely affected.
This suggests that loss of PSD-95 palmitoylation would happen before reductions in PSD-95. Importantly,
Palmostatin B injections in the intraperitoneal cavity rescued that effect in a dose dependent manner, which
indicates that this drug can access brain synapses in vivo. In this project, we will investigate the functional
consequences of that rescue and test if deficits observed in these APP/PS1 mice can be ameliorated by
increasing synaptic PSD-95. We expect that inhibiting PSD-95 depalmitoylation will improve performance in
behavioral tests involving memory and rescue synaptic physiology impairments in these AD model mice.
Overall, this innovative project will characterize PSD-95 trafficking in different brain regions and test if
pharmacological blockade of PSD-95 depalmitoylating enzyme can rescue deficits in APP/PS1 model mice.
Finally, increasing synaptic PSD-95 should make vulnerable synapses stronger, which would be beneficial for
both treating and preventing AD."
10885123,"Project Summary/Abstract (Overall)
This application is a competitive renewal of a program project grant entitled, “The intersection of innate and
adaptive immunity to intracellular pathogens.” A major goal of this P01 is to identify and characterize innate
immune pathways that are triggered, avoided, or manipulated by intracellular pathogens and to determine
the role of these pathways during infection and immunity. More specifically, in this P01 we focus on the
microbiology and immunobiology of three diverse facultative intracellular bacterial pathogens; Listeria
monocytogenes, Legionella pneumophila, and importantly, M. tuberculosis. An overall theme of this
application is that the innate immune system detects key metabolites and virulence activities of intracellular
bacterial pathogens, including cytosolic invasion or access via dedicated bacterial secretion systems. For
example, all three pathogens under investigation activate STING, either by direct secretion of a cyclic-di-
nucleotide (CDN) or by activation of host cell cGAS in response to bacterial DNA, to activate STING,
culminating in critical host responses including activation of a type I IFN and autophagy. In Project 1,
Portnoy extends his studies on the roles of c-di-AMP and STING by examining how c-di-AMP secretion
affects L. monocytogenes pathogenesis and dissemination to the placenta and brain during an oral model of
infection. In Project 2, Cox asks how M. tuberculosis uses its ESX-1 type VII secretion system to perforate
phagosomal membranes, activate STING and induce production of type I IFN, which promotes infection, but
also activates ubiquitin-mediated autophagy responses, which serves to limit infection. However, while type
I IFNs are generally accepted to play a crucial role in orchestrating anti-viral immunity, the roles of type I
IFNs in the responses to bacteria are complex and often exacerbate infection by bacterial pathogens. In
Project 3, Vance presents preliminary data suggesting that type I IFN-dependent induction of the
interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) is an important mechanism by which type I IFNs exacerbate
bacterial infections. We also explore the idea that CDNs are just one example of immunostimulatory
bacterial metabolites by analyzing two other bacterial metabolites that lead to the activation of what are
classified as innate or invariant T-cells, including MAIT cells and Vg9Vd2 T-cells. We will ascertain the
relevance of these metabolites during L. monocytogenes and M. tuberculosis infection (Projects 1, 2 and
4). In Project 4, Stanley propose to follow up on her preliminary data showing the CDN-based protein
vaccines result in a robust and durable tuberculosis vaccines especially when introduced intranasally that is
associated with induction of a protective Th17 response. Stanley proposes to evaluate a number of vaccine
strategies using CDNs in combination with modified BCG and L. monocytogenes-based vectors."

 Late onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) is a neurodegenerative disease with a multifactorial etiology and
intersecting genetic and environmental risks, making it a complex systems challenge. Brain functions are
highly energy-dependent, with most of which generated by mitochondria via oxidative phosphorylation. While
the association between LOAD and an early decline in brain glucose metabolism and changes in mitochondrial
function is well-established, therapeutics that universally enhance brain mitochondrial function have yet resulted
in favorable outcomes. As the greatest genetic risk factor for LOAD, the e4 variant of APOE (APOE4) was also
found to affect brain bioenergetics and lipid metabolism via incompletely understood mechanisms. Considering
the metabolically diverse cellular composition of the brain and APOE as an inter-cellular lipid carrier, we propose
that cell type-specific intra-cellular bioenergetic shifts and inter-cellular metabolic uncoupling of fatty acid (FA)
metabolism underlie APOE4-driven AD relevant metabolic phenotypes in the brain. Specifically, we hypothesize
that APOE4-induced disruption to astrocytic clearance of neuronal FAs and subsequent degradation in astrocytic
mitochondria could elicit lipid dysregulation, neuronal dysfunction, neuroinflammation and cognitive decline.
 Program of research proposed herein will determine the mechanisms, at the cellular level, by which APOE
polymorphism alters brain bioenergetics and lipid homeostasis, and eventually LOAD risk. To test our
hypotheses, we will implement three levels of investigations to understand the complex mechanisms underlying
APOE regulation of metabolic coupling between neuron and astrocytes. Aim 1 will determine and differentiate
the effect of APOE isoforms on cellular metabolic shift in neurons and astrocytes using single-cell transcriptomics
and in vitro functional assessment. Using a neuron-astrocyte co-culture system, Aim 2 is designed to investigate
the impact and mechanism by which different isoforms and origins (neuronal- vs. astrocytic) of APOE affect
neuron-astrocyte metabolic coupling, focusing on fatty acid metabolism. Aim 3 will test determine how
perturbations to neuron-astrocyte metabolic coupling mediate APOE4-induced LOAD at-risk phenotypes during
aging in vivo.
 Projected outcomes from this research will elucidate how cell types with distinctive bioenergetic
phenotypes jointly maintain the brain metabolic homeostasis, and how APOE4 increases risk of LOAD by
disrupting the metabolic system of the brain. Translationally, this research will shed light on selective cell
vulnerability in AD development and has the potential to identify APOE genotype-specific and cell type-
specific therapeutic targets to sustain or restore a bioenergetic equilibrium and lipid homeostasis in the brain
that are resilient against synaptic- and cognitive declines in LOAD."
10837741,"OVERALL ABSTRACT – MATERNAL IMMUNIZATION AND DETERMINANTS OF INFANT IMMUNITY
(MADI)
Infectious diseases remain the leading cause of death in children under 5 years worldwide. The most affected
are newborns and infants within the first year of life. Maternal and infant immunity are interrelated. Immune
fitness of the mother is key to sustained health of a child. Vaccination during pregnancy enhances maternal
immunity and has a tremendous potential to improve neonatal immunity to pathogens. However, major gaps
remain in our understanding of how the immunologically unique setting of pregnancy influences
responses to vaccination, the rules of maternal Ab transfer, and the interactions between transferred
maternal Ab and the infant immune system. To fill this knowledge gap, we have proposed synergistic and
multidisciplinary studies organized in three Aims that will:
1. Distinguish unique features and predictors of vaccine-induced immunity during pregnancy.
2. Define the principles governing maternal antibody transfer.
3. Identify determinants of infant immunity and responses to vaccines.
MADI consists of four integrated and synergistic Projects (P) and three Cores (C): P1 will determine the influence
of pregnancy on Ab biophysical and functional features and on B/T cell responses to vaccines. P2 will identify
Ab-intrinsic factors underlying transfer via placenta and breast milk. P3 will identify features of transferred
maternal Ab mediating immunity to pathogens and regulating vaccine responses in infants. P4 will identify
cellular and molecular predictors of responses to vaccination in the mother-infant dyad. C1 will provide cutting-
edge systems serology and Ab engineering technologies, training, and quality control. C2 will provide centralized
management and analysis of data from all projects and will manage data dissemination. The Admin Core will
provide management and programmatic support.
The MADI team combines complementary expertise, access to unique and well characterized clinical
cohorts, and state-of-the-art methods to dissect complex maternal-infant immune interactions.
MADI has public health significance and translational value in 1) investigating the immunobiology of maternal
immunization at a new breadth and depth; 2) identifying novel actionable targets to improve effectiveness of
maternal immunization; 3) informing vaccine design and implementation; and 4) stimulating the field of maternal-
infant immunology and vaccinology by generating new analytical tools, mechanistic insights, and rich hypothesis-
generating systems immunology datasets. Such knowledge can transform the field of maternal immunization."
10795717,"We propose a circuit-level principal underlying how brains acquire 'episodic' memories and reprocess
them into compact, efficient 'schemas': The attributes or 'contents' of experience are represented primarily in
the deeper layers of neocortex (NC), whereas the superficial layers are dedicated to encoding the contexts in
which the attributes occur. Synaptic associations between superficial context codes and deep attribute codes
permit contexts to evoke appropriate attribute output hence enabling memory recall and predictive behavior.
 The hippocampus (HC) is essential for acquisition of memories and for their reprocessing into efficient,
schematic representations of the world. NC exhibits dense local but sparse long-range connectivity, which
severely limits its ability to make rapid, long-range associations. HC likely solves this dilemma by merging the
totality of the brain's current internal state (i.e., sensory input and internal variables such as hunger, fear,
current goals) into a unique, 'index' code that is projected to NC, and associated with its current, distributed,
attribute representation. Retrieval of an index code evokes the corresponding attributes. Such HC-orchestrated
retrieval may enable the gradual rewiring of NC circuitry in a manner that captures the overall statistics of
experience, much the same way as deep, artificial, neural networks learn incrementally by small connection
weight adjustments directed by the overall statistics of the input. Our hypothesis on the laminar division of
labor in this process is based on the facts that HC output is directed primarily to upper layers of NC, which
implements a 'spatial' coding scheme that is lost after HC lesions; and that the deeper layers of NC frequently
exhibit more robust responsiveness to and discrimination of sensory inputs than the superficial ones.
 We propose to record cellular level, neural ensemble activity simultaneously from deep and superficial
layers in primary and association cortex, using high-density, electrophysiological recording. First, we attempt to
establish the 'attribute vs index' principal by showing that deep cells shift their firing locations with shifts in the
relevant sensory attributes, whereas superficial cells do not. Next we test the hypothesis that, as NC
accumulates large amounts of diverse experience, attribute representations in deeper layers becomes sparser
and more categorically organized, whereas superficial layer coding is relatively unchanged. To accomplish this,
we employ a recent chemogenetic advance that enables us to acquire large amounts of resting-state cellular
data, in which we expect the predicted changes will be most easily observed. We also explore the statistics of
excitatory-inhibitory cell functional connectivity that may underlie such coding statistics changes. The expected
advances in understanding cortical memory and schema encoding circuits will ultimately improve clinical
assessment of, and intervention in memory and cognitive disorders."
11073265,"Aging is associated with the development of nonresolving pulmonary fibrosis in both human and experimental
animals. Stiffening of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is a prominent feature of lung fibrosis. Interactions
between stiffened fibrotic ECM and effector cells of tissue fibrosis, known as myofibroblasts (MFBs), provide a
feedforward mechanism that sustains/amplifies lung fibrosis. Targeting matrix stiffness to break the profibrotic
feedback loop represents a promising strategy for treatment of persistent/progressive lung fibrosis. The
current study aimed to test a proof-of-concept of matrix de-stiffening therapy against lung fibrosis associated
with aging. Previous studies have shown that the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs)
accumulates with aging and occurs at an accelerated rate in lung fibrosis. The ECM, in particular collagen
matrix, is highly susceptible to glycation due to its slow turnover rate. AGEs drives nonenzymatic crosslinking
of collagen fibers. The formation of intra- and inter-molecular collagen crosslinks is a crucial factor that stiffens
the ECM. In preliminary studies, we targeted AGE-mediated glycation crosslinking for matrix de-stiffening and
potential anti-fibrotic therapy against aging-associated nonresolving lung fibrosis in a bleomycin injury-induced
mouse model. We found that anti-AGE treatment reduces the amount of crosslinked lung collagens,
decreases lung stiffness, and promotes the resolution of experimental lung fibrosis in aged mice. We identified
mouse double minute 4 (MDM4), a major endogenous inhibitor of p53, as a matrix stiffness-regulated
mechanosensitive molecule. Reducing matrix stiffness downregulates MDM4 expression, resulting in p53 de-
repression/activation. Gain of p53 function sensitizes lung MFBs to apoptosis by upregulating Fas and induces
immunogenic conversion of MFBs that release CX3CL1 chemokine to recruit macrophages and express Death
Domain 1α (DD1α) engulfment receptor to facilitate macrophage-mediated phagocytosis of apoptotic MFBs.
These findings suggest that matrix de-stiffening by targeting nonenzymatic AGE crosslinking activates a
fibrosis resolution pathway. The central hypothesis of the current project is that matrix de-stiffening sensing by
MDM4 promotes lung MFB clearance and the reversal of aging-associated nonresolving pulmonary fibrosis.
Specific aims are: (1) determine the mechanisms by which matrix stiffness regulates MDM4 expression; (2)
determine whether matrix stiffness sensing by MDM4 mediates the clearance of lung MFBs by activation of a
p53-directed gene program involving Fas, CX3CL1 and DD1α; and (3) determine the role of mechanosensitive
MDM4 in the fate decisions of lung MFBs and the reversal of aging-associated pulmonary fibrosis in mice. The
proposed study will elucidate cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the reversal of aging-associated
lung fibrosis by targeting nonenzymatic AGE crosslinking. The hypothesis, if proven, will establish a proof-of-
concept of matrix de-stiffening therapy against aging-associated nonresolving pulmonary fibrosis."
10923989,"PROJECT SUMMARY - Overall
Average life expectancy for Alaska Native and American Indian (ANAI) people is 10 years shorter than non-
Hispanic Whites, and ANAIs have higher death rates from conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and
cancer. Yet, healthcare services in ANAI communities are significantly underfunded. Tribes and health
organizations serving ANAI patients need evidence about the successful implementation of effective
interventions to improve ANAI health outcomes. Southcentral Foundation (SCF), a tribally-owned and operated
healthcare organization with an award-winning model of healthcare delivery and redesign, thus proposes a set
of five independent yet related efforts in this Center application, “Building Capacity for Dissemination and
Implementation Research in a Tribal Healthcare System.” SCF is the primary applicant and will lead
these efforts with local partners at the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium and University of Alaska,
as well as national partners at the University of Washington, Mayo Clinic, and University of Arkansas
Medical Sciences. Other experts within and outside of Alaska will provide additional support.
Implementing a Diabetes Screening and Referral Services Developed for Dental Clinics Within an
Urban Alaska Native Health Care Setting (RP1) will study the implementation of an evidence-based
intervention to identify ANAIs at risk for diabetes; Metabolism-Informed Care to Aid Alaska Native People
to Quit Smoking (RP2) will assess the acceptability and feasibility of using a nicotine metabolite ratio test to
select smoking cessation treatment; and Jumpstarting Culturally-informed Advance Care Planning with
ANAI People in Primary Care (RP3) will evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of an evidence-
based, culturally-tailored palliative care intervention in ANAIs with serious illness. Two capacity building
efforts will optimize success of the RPs and Center as a whole. The Researcher Career Enhancement
Project will provide ongoing training and mentoring in foundational research skills and build new capacity
in D&I research. The Administrative Core will support communication and coordination, implement a unified
evaluation strategy, and create a new career pathway for ANAI Research Administrators. All Center
components will be evaluated using two well-recognized D&I research frameworks: Reach, Effectiveness,
Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) and the Consolidated Framework for
Implementation Research (CFIR).
The proposed Center will expand research capacity within an established ANAI-led and -operated
Research Department. Fulfillment of the specific aims will advance the capacity the tribal healthcare
organization and ANAI researchers to lead future research focused on improving the health of ANAIs."
10899710,"SUMMARY/Abstract:
The long-term goal of the Cincinnati Cooperative Center of Excellence in Hematology (CCCEH) is to
understand and correct, at the molecular level, hematological diseases of various lineages. To attain this goal,
we must understand basic biological processes that affect behaviors of hematopoietic stem cells and their
various differentiated progenies in vitro and in vivo. We envision this long-term goal will be best accomplished
by interdisciplinary and collaborative approaches using state-of-the-art methods, along with timely and rational
use of translational studies into the preclinical and clinical settings. Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical
Center (CCHMC) has developed a rich and stimulating intellectual environment that brings together
outstanding expertise and basic research in stem cell biology, virus vector technology, immunohematologic cell
biology, genomics and genetics, and hematopoiesis; in addition, the CCCEH has world-class expertise in
translational and clinical research in hematology, immunology and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
This focus has been greatly strengthened by the recruitment of over 30 faculty members in these areas of
hematology research over the last 15 years at CCHMC, and the inclusion of over 15 external hematology
researchers around US. Basic research is linked with Cincinnati NIH-funded Clinical and Translational Science
Award (CTSA), which has facilitated interdisciplinary interactions and developed an infrastructure that supports
state-of-the-art clinical trials in cell and gene therapy. Here we seek to solidify the exciting and systemic growth
of research in hematology at CCHMC to support a national center of excellence, using the shared services and
administrative structure of the center grant mechanism. The CCCEH Administrative Core supports an
exceptional array of research cores, which function together to support innovative basic and translational
research both locally and nationally, in non-malignant hematology. Our three proposed research cores include
(1) Xenotransplant and Genome Editing Core, which maintains specialized mouse strains and provides mouse
transplant and transgenic services; (2) Single Cell Characterization and Procurement Core that includes state-
of-the-art imaging as well as single cell capture and gene expression capabilities; and (3) Gene Delivery Core
that covers services such as ex vivo manipulation of blood cells by lentivirus and retrovirus transduction and
shRNA/sgRNA screening. Finally, this center seeks support for an innovative Enrichment Program that fosters
a collaborative and educational environment in the center and for outreach to the broad hematology research
community around US."
10798104,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
The White Mountain Apache Tribe (WMAT) and Johns Hopkins University (JHU) have partnered
successfully on NARCH I, III, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX and X. Each NARCH application has included an
integrated focus on training and community driven research which has deepened our understanding
of local and cross-tribal health disparities, produced new public health solutions and added to the
continuous development of our innovative training model that combines student and faculty
development. Overall goals of the WMAT-JHU NARCH XI initiative are to: 1) increase the pool of
trained American Indian/ Alaska Native (AI/AN) scientists and research professionals; 2) strengthen
our partnership with JHU and other research institutions through innovative community-based
participatory research combining WMA and western cultural and scientific knowledge and world
views; and 3) field innovative, strengths-based and culturally driven research to combat major AI/AN
health disparities. The WMAT-JHU NARCH XI application includes four components to meet these
goals: 1) a student and faculty development project that will integrate academic and field-based
research training, and 2) three NARCH research projects to: a) address the large burden of
Staphylococcus aureus; b) address alcohol, opioid, and other substance use among at-risk Apaches;
and, c) improve breast cancer screening among White Mountain Apache women. The research
projects are focused on tribal-specific priorities and designed to provide a supportive, multi-disciplined
platform for training Apache investigators on broad scientific research methods. Methodological
approaches and rigorous evaluation designs will contribute new cultural and scientific understanding
to protective factor-based intervention development and outcomes in AI/AN settings. Apache
scientists will build skills in: biomedical and behavioral sciences, qualitative and quantitative research
methods, culturally grounded development and deep structure adaptation of strengths-based
evidence-informed interventions; and, rigorous, culturally competent evaluation approaches. The
studies are built upon previous NARCH research findings, will apply innovative methods and
approaches, and tap cultural and community assets to address major AI health disparities across the
lifespan with potential for intergenerational impact. Activities have been selected and will be guided
by the existing White Mountain Apache NARCH Community Advisory Board."
10872202,"CONTE CENTER SUMMARY
Neuroactive steroids (NAS) offer novel directions for psychiatric therapeutics. The prototypical NAS is
allopregnanolone (AlloP), which under the formulation of brexanolone, has recently been approved by FDA
for treatment of women with postpartum depression; a second, orally-active NAS has had a successful
Phase 3 study for postpartum depression and a Phase 2B study for men and women with major depression.
While AlloP is a potent and effective enhancer of GABAA receptors (GABAARs), it is not presently clear that
the antidepressant effects of NAS are mediated solely by GABAergic effects, and recent data indicate that
other mechanisms including effects on cellular stress and inflammatory pathways could also be involved.
Members of our center have extensive experience studying the medicinal chemistry and mechanisms
underlying the effects of AlloP-like NAS. In this Conte Center proposal we will leverage novel NAS
compounds to probe varied molecular, synaptic, network and behavioral effects of NAS as clues to their
therapeutic mechanisms and potential. Our center proposal is driven by unique NAS analogues
synthesized in our Chemistry Core and involves three complementary and intertwined projects that will
pursue three specific goals. First, we will test the hypothesis that selective actions of NAS on a class of
GABAARs underlies effects on hippocampal electrical activity, network function and behavior in novel
mouse lines and mouse models of postpartum and major depression. Second, we will examine the role of
non-GABAA ion channels in mediating hippocampal and behavioral effects of NAS focusing on novel NAS
that modulate NMDA glutamate receptors and low voltage activated calcium channels. These studies will
use unique photoaffinity labeling approaches to elucidate sites of actions of NAS on NMDA receptors and
other targets. Other studies will examine effects of NAS analogues on cellular function, neural network
function, and behavior. Third, we will test the role of intracellular targets engaged by NAS on hippocampal
circuits and behavior, focusing on the roles of neuroinflammation and cellular stress pathways. Our center
is uniquely positioned to traverse the exploration of antidepressant NAS from molecules to sites of action
and effects on dysfunctional circuits to identify potentially novel agents and targets for psychiatric
therapeutic development."
10907607,"The study objective is to establish the efficacy of high-intensity endurance exercise as first-line therapy for
recently diagnosed people with Parkinson's disease (PD). No medications are yet proven to slow the progression of the signs of PD and dopaminergic medications do not benefit all the signs of PD. As such, people with PD have no adequate treatment to slow down the progression of the motor or non-motor signs of the disease. The
key question is whether there is an additional benefit of exercising at high-intensity, in terms of slowing the
progression of the signs of the disease, beyond the well documented benefit of treadmill training on general
parameters of fitness, gait and functional mobility. Preclinical data, experimental data on humans, and
epidemiological data all have demonstrated benefits of endurance exercise on the motor and nonmotor signs
and symptoms of the disease, although the best dose for slowing down their progression has not been identified.
We recently completed a multicenter Phase II clinical trial, the SPARX study, using a futility design. We studied
the feasibility of participants with PD performing moderate intensity (60-65% of their maximal heart rate (HRmax))
and high intensity endurance exercise (80-85% HRmax). Participants had not yet started dopaminergic
medication. We demonstrated that: 1) participants will exercise at between 80-85% of HRmax for at least 6
months, 2) they will exercise for at least 3 days per week, 3) adverse events are low, and 4) exercising at 80-
85% HRmax slowed progression by 2.9 points on the motor section of the UPDRS when compared to the wait
list usual care group and was not deemed futile. These 4 findings were deemed a priori to be the necessary
results to proceed to a Phase III efficacy trial. We now propose to conduct a 12-month multi-center, randomized
(two doses of intensity), evaluator-masked study of high intensity endurance exercise. The 2 doses of treadmill
exercise are moderate intensity (4 days/wk for 30 minutes per session at 60- 65% HRmax) and high intensity (4
days/wk for 30 minutes per session at 80-85% HRmax). The study is designed to test 3 specific aims. First, to
establish the efficacy of high-intensity endurance exercise to slow the progression of the signs of PD as
measured by the change in the MDS-Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS Part III) score over
6 and 12 months. Second, to ascertain the effect of high dose endurance versus moderate dose endurance
exercise on the progression of the signs of PD over 6 and 12 months as measured by: 1) distance covered in 6
minute walk, 2) an increased number of daily steps, 3) improved cognitive function, 4) increased VO2max, 5)
improved quality of life, and 6) time to initiate dopaminergic medication and the quantity of medication. Third, to
test the effects of high intensity endurance exercise on PD over 12 months on biomarkers of dopaminergic
neuronal integrity and blood-derived biomarkers of inflammation, and neurotrophic factors.
The study design will facilitate the translation of the study results into a meaningful clinical application of clear therapeutic value."
10700537,"Cerebrovascular dysfunction and blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairment are very common in neurological
disorders, including age-related Alzheimer’s disease and related Dementia (AD/ADRD), head injuries including
traumatic brain injury (TBI) and stroke. Microvascular injury and BBB breakdown often result in a cascade of
events including extravasation of plasma proteins that are toxic to neuronal cells, parenchymal edema, hypoxia,
metabolic stress including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) dysfunction, accumulation of metabolic wastes, activation
of microglial and astrocytes, and eventually neuronal dysfunctions. Our central hypothesis is microvascular injury
among different pathological conditions such as aging and AD can be attributed to an intrinsic molecular driver
on BBB dysfunctions, which ultimately influence neuropathology and the development of cognitive impairment.
Based on our preliminary data from comprehensive bioinformatic analysis and validations in multiple models of
neurological disorders, we hypothesize that specific TMEM252 upregulation in BBB is a common molecular
signature for microvascular injury. Mechanistically, TMEM252 may drive the microvascular injury endophenotype
by inducing ER-dependent BBB dysfunctions. Hence, we propose to determine whether TMEM252 upregulation
is a key event of microvascular injury and a common mechanism in aging and AD. More specifically, we will first
provide a mechanistically understand TMEM252 functions in BBB (AIM 1), then understand the role of TMEM252
in age- and AD-associated microvascular injury using TMEM252-deficient mice (AIM 2), and finally examine the
potential of targeting TMEM252 as an intervention for microvascular injury and BBB dysfunction in vivo (AIM 3).
By phenotypically characterizing Tmem252 deficient model and its cross with Tg2576 model at multiple
physiological levels, we hope to define a TMEM252-dependent link to vascular dysfunctions in aging and AD.
As this molecular signature of microvascular injury was based on scRNA-seq analysis of multiple datasets
obtained in TBI and aging mice, and cross-examined in human and mouse aging and AD samples, we expect
that the propose project will provide very unique information regarding the common microvascular injury
endophenotype across many neurological conditions. The data to be gathered from this study will expand our
understanding of microvascular injury, as well as capture the nuance of the vascular changes between normal
aging and AD. The successful completion of this study will provide new insights into the role of ER dysfunctions
in microvascular injury, and novel molecular target for potential therapeutic intervention of microvascular injury
in aging, AD and beyond."

approaches to advance health equity in Navajo communities by supporting original research and translating
research results to inform health policy, programs and practice for Navajo and other Native communities."
10883949,"Project Summary
The overarching goal of the present proposal is to understand how individual differences in the structure and
function of Locus Coeruleus (LC) moderate perception and memory in an older adult population. There is
substantial evidence that the LC circuit plays a central role in cognitive processes and neuronal loss in LC is
known to occur in neurodegenerative disorders such as ADRD and PD. Integrity of LC neurons is hypothesized
to mediate the preservation of cognitive abilities during normal aging as well. To date, however, there exists a
dearth of research that either characterizes differential effects of LC integrity or details relationships between LC
integrity and cognitive function in older adult humans. More generally, the link between LC activity and cognitive
processes has not been well characterized in humans. Historical reasons for this is that the LC has been difficult
to image due to its small size and thus most human research makes inferences about LC function by using pupil
dilation as a surrogate measure. To overcome existing limitations in the field, we propose a series of detailed
psychophysical and MRI-based studies in older adults aimed to characterize how LC structure and function
moderates behavior and in turn how this is mediated by activity in intermediate brain regions known to be
involved in perceptual and memory processes. We further propose computational approaches to characterize
individual differences in how LC circuit integrity relates to different patterns of cognitive performance across
tasks, and advanced neuroimaging methods to localize and image the LC, which have been pioneered by our
group. Using MRI-based methods, we will examine LC integrity using high-resolution neuromelanin-sensitive
structural imaging, tractography and functional connectivity. This approach will allow us to identify candidate
biomarkers of LC circuit integrity. We will use a series of within-subject designs where we manipulate LC activity
and examine whether relationships between LC and behavior and brain regions thought to mediate those
behaviors are consistent or not between different perceptual modalities and memory tasks. Overall this study
will provide an important and much needed understanding of how LC integrity underlies cognitive declines in
older adults. By combining advanced neuroimaging, well-controlled behavioral assessment, and computational
analysis, we expect to uncover previously inaccessible in vivo mechanisms of LC modulation and generate a
unique dataset to address fundamental mechanistic questions of how the LC integrity moderates cognition, how
this varies across older adults and the extent to which relationships between LC and cognition are generalized
or individualized to particular domains. The resulting understanding of LC circuit can help explain how
dysfunctional modulatory circuits may generate cognitive declines or be implicated in normal aging and age-
related disorders such as Alzheimer's and Alzheimer's related disorders. This, in turn, has potential to support
non-invasive methods for diagnosing pathologies associated with LC decline and developing new treatments."
10701858,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – Overall
The prediction, detection, management and prevention of persistent post-concussive symptoms (PPCS)
represent some of the most important neurological challenges in the science of traumatic brain injury (TBI) today.
For the purposes of this application, PPCS will refer to post-concussive symptoms lasting ≥3 months, consistent
with the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Common Data Elements for concussion. We
approach this using the concept of endophenotypes, quantitative behavioral traits characterized by objective
measures using blood-based, imaging or autonomic measures or other techniques. Understanding the
endophenotypes of PPCS will provide opportunities for early identification and potentially for intervention,
treatment and prevention. The overarching goal of this application is to develop a predictive algorithm for
PPCS endophenotypes in early and middle adolescents (EMA) to inform clinical screening, management
and future research. Our specific aims are: Specific Aim 1. In a Development Cohort, develop and characterize
individual objective biomarkers predictive of PPCS by combining biomarkers with symptom clusters and
neuropsychological function. Biomarkers will be examined in 3 Research Cores: Autonomic, Imaging and Blood-
based. Specific Aim 2. To develop and characterize endophenotypes of PPCS in EMA by combining two or
more objective biomarkers with symptom clusters and neuropsychological measures. Specific Aim 3. To
prospectively validate endophenotype biomarkers from Aims 1 and 2 in a broad group of EMA with concussion
(Validation Cohort). Specific Aim 4. To create a clinically useful risk stratification algorithm using validated
biomarkers, in conjunction with symptoms and neurobehavioral function, which will predict the development of
PPCS. The Development Cohort will be recruited from existing concussion and sports medicine clinics at 6
sites within the Four Corners Youth Consortium (4CYC). This cohort will include subjects presenting from 0-12
months after concussion, will likely be enriched in those with PPCS, and has proven feasible for recruitment into
an observational prospective registry. The Validation Cohort will be recruited from the same clinics but also
expanded to primary care clinics/networks and emergency departments (acutely/subacutely) and followed to a
chronic time point. With this broader and more generalizable cohort, the candidate blood-based, imaging and
autonomic biomarkers from the Development Cohort will be tested and validated. It is from these 2nd cohort data
that a predictive algorithm (likely combining clinical and biomarker measures) will be developed."
10437726,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a serious psychiatric illness that affects ~1% of adolescents and is associated with
high rates of morbidity and mortality. Family-based treatment (FBT), which involves empowering caregivers to
take control of refeeding to restore the adolescent to a normative weight and eating trajectory, is postulated to
operate via increasing caregiver self-efficacy related to refeeding, and decreasing adolescent distress through
repeated exposure to eating- and weight-related stimuli. Although FBT is currently considered the “first line”
treatment for adolescent AN, it is underutilized in community settings and is unavailable to many families for a
multitude of practical reasons (e.g., costs of treatment, limited availability of trained providers in many regions
of the country), particularly those from underrepresented sociodemographic groups. Furthermore, a substantial
subset of families do not optimally respond to FBT, which may be due to failure of newly acquired intervention
skills to generalize outside of the (typically office-based) treatment context. Home-based treatment is an
alternative to traditional office-based outpatient treatment that can reduce many pragmatic barriers to treatment
uptake and engagement, and may enhance generalizability of treatment skills as it is delivered in multiple
naturalistic settings where refeeding often occurs (e.g., home, school, community). Although home-based
models have been successfully applied to other psychiatric conditions, home-based treatments for AN have
never been tested. Moreover, FBT has undergone limited investigation in “real world” settings outside of
specialty academic and clinical environments dedicated to eating disorders. As a result, much of what is known
about FBT is based on relatively homogeneous samples with limited representation from individuals from lower
income and racial/ethnic minority backgrounds. Furthermore, it is unclear if putative FBT mechanisms apply in
the effectiveness context. The proposed R34 pilot effectiveness trial will assess outcomes, implementation,
and mechanisms of FBT for adolescent AN adapted for the home setting (FBT-HB), delivered in the context of
two community-based behavioral health agencies that serve a primarily lower-income, racially and ethnically
diverse clientele. Adolescents with AN-spectrum disorders (n=50) and their caregivers will be randomly
assigned to either FBT-HB or home-based usual care (integrated family therapy approach). Caregivers and
adolescents will provide data on weight, eating, and putative treatment mechanisms, including caregiver self-
efficacy, adolescent distress, and generalizability of treatment skills. Implementation constructs will be
measured among providers and participating families. Overall aims are to assess preliminary effects of FBT-
HB on adolescent eating and weight outcomes; FBT-HB acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, and fidelity;
and caregiver- and adolescent-level mechanisms of change. The proposed study has clear potential to
advance scientific and clinical understanding of the real-world effectiveness of FBT for AN, including whether
adapting it for the home setting may improve its accessibility and effects on treatment outcome."
10478288,"There is a need and opportunity to improve the lives of the many tens of thousands of young cancer survivors annually, who face lifelong hormone imbalance and infertility due to cancer treatments that damage their reproductive organs. Ovary banking and autotransplantation has been proposed as a method to avoid irreversible damage, yet no clinical method exists to keep whole ovaries viable until re-implantation. Using carefully optimized protocols and effective cryoprotective agents, our team and others have successfully cryopreserved multiple tissues in an ice-free vitreous “glassy” or “amorphous” state, allowing for indefinite storage. Unfortunately, these advances in ice- free preservation had not been matched by similar advances to prevent damage from ice growth and/or fracturing during rewarming preventing viable banking. Recently, however, our Co-PI, Dr Bischof, demonstrated a scalable and biocompatible nanowarming technology using radiofrequency (RF)-excited iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) for ice and fracture avoidance that we demonstrated proof of concept of for vascularized whole ovaries during phase 1 and after.  This program works to preserve fertility and hormone function for cancer survivors by developing nanowarming enabled cryobanking of whole human ovaries and ovarian tissue strips, for re-plantation following damaging chemo and radiation therapies. Combining nanowarming with recent advances in machine perfusion, optimized loading/unloading procedures, next generation non-toxic cryopreservation solutions, computational modeling, and powerful tissue imaging (e.g. cryomacroscopy, uCT, SWIFT-MRI), our approach leverages a convergence of state-of-the-art technologies to develop a comprehensive preservation protocol for reproductive organ protection that will maximize tissue viability.  Building on the success in the feasibility phase, this project will deliver two primary products: (i) improved vitrification and re-warming strategy (compared to current gold-standard slow freezing) for preservation and banking of ovarian tissues for transplantation, (ii) comprehensive tools (including multi-thermic perfusion system), and protocol for recovery and successful banking and nanowarming of whole human ovaries to ultimately support whole ovary re-plantation (not possible with current methods). In addition, this project provides tools, equipment, solutions and protocols with highly- translatable technology toward banking of whole vital organs, and other vascular grafts, addressing widespread needs for breakthroughs in preservation – from improved cell and biospecimen preservation to whole organ banking.  The project’s initial focus is to optimize preservation of human ovarian tissue strips followed by development of a comprehensive banking strategy for whole human ovaries. We will validate early in vitro success in two transplant models: (1) xenotransplantation of human ovarian tissue strips in nude mice, and (2) minimally invasive autotransplantation of nonhuman primate ovarian tissue strips from whole cryopreserved ovaries. Based on the results from Phase 1 with whole ovaries, and subsequent studies since then, we believe that we are close to a successful protocol for indefinite preservation of ovaries. Success of these novel approaches individually or in combination will likely enable further breakthroughs in oncofertility, biopreservation research, and clinical practice."

Study rationale. Microglia, the resident innate immune cells of the central nervous system, are involved in the
maintenance of tissue homeostasis and neuronal circuitry. These microglia specific processes are believed to
become dysregulated during neurodegenerative diseases, such Alzheimer’s disease (AD). It has also been
shown that many of the AD susceptibility genes are primarily expressed in microglia in the brain. Given these
observations, it has been suggested that microglia would constitute an ideal point of intervention for future
preventive and disease modifying therapies for AD. Nonetheless, the notion arose, that such a plastic and
reactive cell type as the microglia would not exist in a single state in such a complex and diverse environment
as the aging brain. This also implies the possibility, that the different subsets would be involved in different
aspects of physiological and pathological processes. Indeed, in our recent single cell RNA sequencing study
we have identified several distinct microglia subpopulations in the aged human brain, that showed (in an
indirect analysis) divergent associations with clinical and histopathological characteristics of brain aging and
AD. Intriguingly, the signature of one particular microglia subset, named Cluster 7, showed an inverse
relationship with both tau pathology and clinical AD, suggesting a potential protective role for this microglia
phenotype. Thus, the overarching goal of the proposed project is to explore the identity of Cluster 7 microglia
and to understand how sex, aging, AD pathology and genetics influence its abundance in the human brain. Our
hypothesis is that aging, AD pathology and genetic susceptibility converge on microglia and result in a
differentiation deficit in particular towards the beneficial Cluster 7 phenotype, thus contributing to disease
progression. We also hypothesize that this process is more pronounced in females than in males. Accordingly,
the objective of the current proposal is: 1) to investigate how the abundance of this phenotype relates to
histopathological and clinical features of brain aging and AD; 2) to understand what are the factors that might
inhibit Cluster 7 microglial fate choice in AD; 3) to explore whether elevated Cluster 7 abundance is associated
with cognitive resilience; and 3) to describe the phenotypic characteristics and epigenetic regulatory landscape
of Cluster 7 microglia. These goals will be achieved through the following 3 aims: In Aim 1 we propose to
measure in situ the abundance of Cluster 7 microglia subpopulation in a large number of aged individuals with
and without AD dementia and will establish the relationship between the abundance of Cluster 7 and sex, age,
histopathological features, AD endophenotypes, AD susceptibility alleles and measures of cognition. In Aim 2,
we will explore the functional and phenotypic characteristics of ex vivo isolated Cluster 7 microglia. In Aim 3,
we will investigate the epigenetic landscape of Cluster 7 microglia in order to understand which transcriptional
regulatory mechanisms underlie its differentiation."

Major health disparities continue to impact tribal nations, yet a serious shortage of scientists conducting
American Indian (AI) health disparities research persists. For several years, Cherokee Nation, the University of
Oklahoma (OU) system, and the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (OMRF) have partnered to address
this issue by building tribal research capacity through the Native American Research Centers for Health
(NARCH) mechanism. In this cycle of NARCH funding, the partnership among Cherokee Nation, OU, and
OMRF continues and, importantly for student career enhancement, expands to include the Oklahoma State
University (OSU) system as a key partner for student career enhancement activities. The overall mission of
Cherokee NARCH is to develop durable research capacity within the context of an American Indian (AI) tribal
nation to address health disparities. To achieve this goal, the five Specific Aims of Cherokee NARCH are:
1. to strengthen administrative infrastructure, including a Leadership Team (LT) and a Tribal-Campus
 Advisory Committee (TCAC), that ensures integration of career enhancement, capacity building, and
 research activities;
2. to educate the next generation of researchers to engage meaningfully with Cherokee Nation in the
 context of tribal research, focusing on undergraduate, graduate and health professions students;
3. to build tribal capacity by developing a set of research codes to govern the conduct of genomic and other
 biomedical research predicated on the concept of tribal data sovereignty;
4. to conduct innovative research and pilot research capable of seeding future research projects
 performed by researchers seeking to work within the Cherokee Nation setting; and
5. to evaluate activities of the partnership, including monitoring progress of student career enhancement,
 capacity building, and research/pilot research projects, and evaluation of the overall Cherokee NARCH
program.
Cherokee NARCH provides a crucial opportunity to solidify the foundation for tribal capacity in health
disparities research. The addition of OSU strengthens Cherokee NARCH by its remarkable success in the
education of AI students in scientific and health professions fields, including the advent of the first tribally
affiliated medical school in the US. Cherokee NARCH therefore provides an unprecedented environment in
which a tribe, two research-intensive universities with large AI student populations (OU and OSU), and a
biomedical research foundation (OMRF) will work synergistically to reduce the unacceptable disparities in
health that continue to affect AI people.

10656275,"Project Summary
Resistance to the standard of care treatments contributes to mortality in patients with metastatic triple negative
breast cancer (TNBC) or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In metastatic TNBC, the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) and cytoplasmic mesenchymal-epithelial transition (cMET) receptor are both overexpressed
in the basal-like subtype of TNBC. Metastatic NSCLC often harbors mutations in the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR), in which patients can develop resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). MET gene
amplification is also a resistance mechanism for EGFR TKIs. To overcome resistance to EGFR TKI, a
bispecific antibody called JNJ-61186372 (BsAb) was developed that targets both EGFR and cMET receptors
simultaneously, inhibiting receptor-ligand activation and degrading these receptors upon internalization of the
bsAb. Currently, there are no effective methods to predict and monitor response to bsAb, making it difficult to
select patients most likely to respond to this new therapy in a clinical trial setting and save those unlikely to
respond from undue drug exposure. We aim to develop PET imaging biomarkers to look at the multifaceted
response to bsAb therapy: bsAb delivery to the tumor (Aim 1) and changes in individual receptor status in vivo
(Aim 2). Through correlative studies among PET imaging, response to bsAb therapy, and known genetic
mutation status in EGFR, we will produce the right PET imaging toolkit to understand the mechanisms of action
of bsAb in vivo. Our techniques can complement standard of care analysis of EGFR mutation status to select
patients most likely to respond to bsAb therapy and monitor response to treatment. This future goal will require
an IND, for which our studies will provide proof-of-feasibility in preclinical models. Ultimately, establishing our
imaging techniques as companion diagnostic agents could have high impact in accelerating FDA-approval of
bsAb for the treatment of patients with NSCLC or TNBC who have developed resistance to standard of care of
treatments."
10884109,"Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with distinct histological and
behavioral hallmarks but its cell-type basis is not clear. Recent discoveries now provide compelling rationale
that constituent cell types bear a non-uniform risk profile as a function of disease and age. Human post-
mortem study showed inhibitory interneurons (IN) and excitatory pyramidal neurons (IN) undergo differential
alterations in gene expression in AD and mouse brain imaging study observed progressive cytological
dedifferentiation of synapse architecture due to aging. These results dovetail with our discovery that the
differential expression of six gene categories, synergistically involved in synaptic communication specifies
neuron-type identity and their diverse morpho-physiological properties. Our central hypothesis is that the
distinct transcriptomic identity that bestows unique cell-type properties also confers an inherent risk and
resilience to AD risk factors, such as age, sex and genetic makeup. We posit that an altered cell-type specific
transcriptome underlies the disparate response of inhibitory and excitatory neuron subtypes in AD and the
dedifferentiation of synapses in aging. Through cross-disciplinary systems biology approaches we will identify
the vulnerable cell-types in AD, establish cell-type specific AD signatures and further investigate biological
relationship between healthy aging and AD pathology. Aim-1 will test the hypothesis that diverse brain cell
subclasses confers differential risk through distinct transcriptomic response to progressive stages of
AD and aging. A subclass specific longitudinal approach will allow us to prioritize for cells that are
fundamental to the genesis of AD. We will determine age-dependent vulnerability in 3xTg-AD mouse by single-
cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) of eight genetically labeled subclass in three major AD associated brain areas,
brain-stem, entorhinal cortex, hippocampus and frontal cortex at 3, 6 and 15 months. Aim-2 will test the
hypothesis that excitatory PNs and inhibitory INs have differential anatomical, morphological and cell
survival trajectories in AD and aging. Synapses in neural circuits control behavior and their progressive
dedifferentiation have been implicated in aging and dementia. As the molecular composition of synapses are
distinct for each neuron-type they will be differentially impacted by AD and age. We will perform whole brain
light-sheet microscopy on PN and IN in 3xTg-AD mouse across three time points 3, 6 and 15 months to
capture the subclass specific dynamics of progressive pathological changes in AD. Aim-3 will test the
hypothesis that cell specific glycosylation codes confers vulnerability to proteinopathy in AD and
aging. Plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are AD hallmarks, however cell specific vulnerability is unknown.
Differential expression of heparin sulfate (HS) enzymes create HS diversity akin to a “glycosylation code” that
predisposes some cells to form aggregates while protecting others. In 3xTg-AD multiplexed RNA in-situ will
measure HS biosynthetic enzyme transcripts, as a function of healthy aging and in pathology."
10890249,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The public health burden of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) continues to increase as
the American population ages. We are becoming increasingly aware of myriad physical and emotional needs
confronted by people with dementia and their informal caregivers (unpaid family and friends) particularly at end
of life (EOL). Most persons with AD/ADRD in the U.S. die in long-term care (LTC) communities, and assisted
living (AL), as the fastest growing LTC option in the U.S., is a primary provider of this care. AL is a social model
of care and in most states does not provide 24-hour skilled nursing care; most care is provided by unlicensed
direct care workers with little or no healthcare training. Therefore, residents' informal caregivers play a critical
role in supplementing this care. Their involvement ranges from social visits to more intensive types of informal
care provision, including hands-on-care and monitoring and managing care that AL staff and other formal care
providers (e.g., hospice) provide. What effect such involvement has on the health of informal caregivers and
their care recipients over time is unknown. Limited empirical evidence from cross-sectional and retrospective
research shows that greater informal caregiver involvement, particularly involvement that is more labor
intensive and emotionally taxing, is associated with higher caregiver burden and suggests that this burden may
be greater for informal caregivers in AL compared with other LTC settings, particularly in the context of caring
for residents with advanced dementia at EOL. Some studies show that lower informal caregiver involvement is
associated with lower resident quality of life of residents but these relationships have not been investigated in
AL in depth or over time and the direction of these effects is unclear. To address these critical knowledge gaps,
we propose a prospective longitudinal multilevel study that will follow 280 residents diagnosed with advanced
AD/ADRD (6 or higher on the 7-stage dementia scale) for 12 months and assess the caregiving experiences of
residents' primary informal caregivers (n=280). We will select residents and their informal caregivers from a
stratified random sample of 45 assisted living communities in Georgia. The overall goal of this 5-year study is
to improve understanding of the relationships between and among informal caregiver involvement, informal
caregiver health (e.g., perceived physical and mental health, caregiver burden, and distress), and quality of life
of assisted living residents with advanced dementia at EOL and to identify potentially modifiable factors at
multiple socioecological levels (individual, AL, and wider community-level) associated with adverse outcomes.
The proposed study supports the National Alzheimer's plan and its mission to improve care and support of
persons with AD/ADRD and their caregivers. It will address significant knowledge gaps that will advance
science and provide information vital to guide policy and practice, including recommendations for training and
education for staff and families, and inform future intervention trials designed to improve EOL dementia care."

Older adults are often victims of financial exploitation, which results in annual losses of at least $3 billion.
Threat of exploitation may be greater in those at risk for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD).
While most cases of financial exploitation are perpetrated by strangers, perpetration by individuals within the
victim's social network (e.g., friends and family) is common. Although these observations highlight the social
nature of financial exploitation, we know very little about how neural systems in older adults and those at risk
for ADRD integrate information from the social domain to inform financial decision making. Tasks involving
social information processing evoke activation in the temporal-parietal junction (TPJ) and dorsomedial
prefrontal cortex; whereas tasks involving financial decision making and reward processing evoke activation in
the striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. It remains unclear whether responses within these neural
systems—and connectivity between them and other regions—differ as a function of age and risk for financial
exploitation. We recently demonstrated age differences in TPJ response during social decision-making in the
context of financial exchange (e.g., trust and fairness). We have also shown that the influence of social context
(e.g., presence of a peer) on striatal responses to reward is attenuated in older adults relative to younger
adults. Building on these exciting preliminary data, the goal of the current proposal is to characterize neural
responses during social decision making and reward processing across adulthood and quantify how these
responses relate to risk for financial exploitation. We will recruit a large sample of adults (ages 21 to 80+ years)
to participate in a neuroimaging experiment investigating social reward processing and the interplay between
social context and financial decision making. We will also administer neuropsychological and health
assessments, as well as questionnaires assessing socioemotional functioning and risk for financial
exploitation. Our project will address four aims. We will examine how neural responses to social and nonsocial
reward and decisions based on trust and fairness differ across the lifespan (Aim 1). Although neural responses
evoked by our tasks may be associated with risk for financial exploitation, it is imperative to determine how
such responses interact with sociodemographic factors, cognitive decline, socioemotional functioning, and
health (Aim 2). Notably, our quantification of health status will leverage two understudied risk factors for
ADRD—vascular health and white matter hyperintensities—and relate these factors to financial exploitation.
Finally, we will re-test a subset of participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) two years after their
baseline visit and assess changes in social reward processing and risk for financial exploitation (Aim 3).
Overall, our project will generate new insights into the interplay between social and financial decision making
across the lifespan and individuals at risk for ADRD and start the road to translation by characterizing risk
factors for financial exploitation among vulnerable groups."
10883919,"ABSTRACT
Many older Mexican adults rely on adult children, extended family, and friends (i.e., informal care resources) to
meet financial, housing, and daily needs. Older adults with strong networks may not worry about having few
financial resources, living in poor housing, or not being able to access long-term care services, because they
expect that these needs will be met by their adult children. However, this expectation may become less realistic
as family sizes have become smaller, adult children are increasingly moving away for work, and cultural values
change. Additionally, Mexico has limited healthcare resources and infrastructure (i.e., formal care resources) to
meet the needs of an aging population. This is concerning because the incidence of Alzheimer's disease and
related dementias (ADRD) in Mexico is among the highest in Latin America. This has important implications for
the demand for healthcare services and the need for support from family.
The life course is the temporal sequence of events, transitions, and trajectories in important life domains, such
as education, family composition, and health. A person's life course is shaped by contextual factors. In Mexico,
contextual factors that have likely shaped ADRD risk and the availability of care resources in old age include
migration policies, family planning policies, economic shocks, and healthcare and pension reforms. These events
have caused successive generations of older adults to be born into and age within very different contexts.
Knowledge of contextual and individual life course factors that influence ADRD risk, access to care resources,
and use of care resources are established gaps in aging research. We will use the Mexican Health and Aging
Study to complete three specific aims. (1) Identify life course pathways for ADRD in an older adult population
that has overcome social, economic, and health disadvantages in childhood and middle age. (2) Determine how
changing social and cultural contexts over the life course have impacted the availability of informal and formal
care resources for older adults in Mexico. (3) Determine how older adults in a country with a poor infrastructure
for an aging population meet their long-term care needs as they transition from cognitively unimpaired to ADRD.
This project is expected to produce evidence on the life course pathways that influence ADRD risk as well as
the availability and use of care resources for older adults in a country with low institutional support, high
inequality, and the likely high care burden of ADRD for families and institutions. The expected findings of this
research are also relevant to the US. Poor economic conditions and rejoining family are among the many factors
that motivate Mexicans to migrate to the US. This, along with the aging of the Mexican-American population,
makes it critical to understand how risk factors across life stages impact older adults' risk for ADRD."
10884106,"Project Summary/Abstract: Understanding the aggregation of the β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) to form toxic
oligomers is fundamental to understanding the molecular basis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Despite decades of
research, the structures of Aβ oligomers remain a mystery, constituting a significant gap in understanding AD.
This proposal seeks to address this knowledge gap through the structural, biophysical, and biological profiling of
a diverse group of Aβ oligomer models and correlation of these models with biogenic Aβ oligomers.
 My laboratory has developed an approach for create structurally defined Aβ oligomer models composed of
peptide fragments from Aβ constrained into a β-hairpin. The X-ray crystallographic structures of these Aβ β-
hairpin peptides reveal the structures of oligomers that the peptides can form and key intermolecular contacts
that the peptides make in the oligomeric state. These contacts reveal sites that can be crosslinked to create
covalently stabilized Aβ oligomer models that mimic the crystallographic oligomers. Studying the crosslinked
oligomers then allows detailed correlation between oligomer structure and biophysical and biological properties.
 We will characterize how our Aβ oligomer models interact with and affect neurons, microglia, and astrocytes,
to provide detailed insights into how our Aβ oligomer models impact different brain cell types and thus help shed
light on the relationship between Aβ oligomer structure and cellular events that occur in AD. We will use
fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence-assisted cell sorting (FACS) to visualize and quantify the interactions
and uptake of our Aβ oligomer models with neurons, microglia, and astrocytes. We will evaluate downstream
biochemical and cellular effects elicited by Aβ oligomer models in neurons, microglia, and astrocytes and
evaluate how treatment affects apoptosis, necrosis, calcium homeostasis, endoplasmic reticulum stress,
oxidative stress, neurite length, tau phosphorylation and aggregation, and proinflammatory responses in
microglia and astrocytes. To elucidate the relationship between the structures of our Aβ oligomer models and
biogenic Aβ oligomers, we will generate polyclonal antibodies against each Aβ oligomer model and then examine
the immunoreactivity of these antibodies with brain protein extract and brain slices from 5XFAD mice.
 We will discover new Aβ oligomer models, by creating new Aβ β-hairpin peptides that contain more of the
Aβ peptide sequence and alternate β-strand alignments. We will create new crosslinked Aβ oligomer models by
identifying key contacts in existing and newly discovered Aβ oligomer models and then engineering in disulfide
bonds to stabilize the oligomers. To characterize the structures and oligomerization properties of the new Aβ
oligomer models that we generate, we will use X-ray crystallography and a variety of other biophysical
experiments, including CD spectroscopy, SDS-PAGE, size exclusion chromatography (SEC), analytical
ultracentrifugation (AUC), NMR spectroscopy, and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies. The
biological and immunological properties of these new Aβ oligomer models will be studied as described above."

researcher wishing to carry out human skin disease research is a potential member of the research
community. The Center is composed of an Administrative Core and three Resource Cores. The Administrative
Core manages and oversees all activities of the Center and administers Diversity and Outreach activities,
including funding for diverse investigators at multiple stages of training and the biennial International
Conference on Human Skin Disease. The Human Tissues Biobank Core provides access to over 113,000
highly characterized consented patients, over 1.5 million banked pathologic specimens, both searchable by
diagnosis, as well as to fresh human skin, purified cell populations from human skin and immunodeficient mice
grafted with human skin and blood. The Single Cell and Immunoanalysis Core provides access to single cell
RNA and ATAC sequencing, flow cytometry-based single cell imaging, mass cytometry by time of flight

In summary, the Center provides access to biobanks and cutting-edge human analytic techniques that enable
translational researchers to carry out high quality human skin disease research."
10581592,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and death rates are higher among Black Americans than non-Hispanic
White Americans. While some CRC-related disparities have decreased (e.g., incidence and stage of
presentation), disparities persist in the context of CRC screening (CRCS). Studies suggest that supportive and
information-rich social networks, both online and offline, could improve CRCS among Black Americans. A
growing body of evidence indicates the importance of online sources of health information seeking and
scanning about CRC and CRCS, but little is known about the impact of the messages that individuals are
encountering on these platforms. Research on the content and volume of messages White and Black
Americans encounter from online health information sources is still unclear—particularly regarding any
disparities that exist about what specific information is sought, scanned, or shared by Black Americans. There
is a critical need to understand which messages resonate among populations at-risk for specific diseases (e.g.,
CRC) and who may have concerns about engaging in early detection behaviors (e.g., CRCS) and may face
disparities in exposure to public information online. The proposed project utilizes and applies novel cancer
communication surveillance approaches (e.g., natural language processing and crowdsourcing) to examine
public health communication about CRC prevention and control. Aim 1 will use computational, natural
language processing approaches to capture and analyze digital and social media information about CRC and
CRCS to identify prominent messages, sources and types of misinformation, and information inequalities. This
approach offers an efficient, effective, and responsive method to monitor (mis)information and emerging
messages about CRCS. Aim 2 will use a crowdsourcing approach (wiki surveys) to assess population
perceptions of public information and messages about CRCS. Recruiting nationally representative samples of
White (N = 1,000) and Black American (N = 1,000) adults ages 45-74, we will use an innovative data collection
procedure known as wiki surveys to rank candidate messages as potential message targets in strategic efforts
to promote CRCS. For Aim 3, we will conduct a randomized controlled message trial (N = 1,600) to determine
the validity of the wiki survey approach to selecting messages for targeted audience segments. We will use
data collected from Study 2 to identify four sets of messages with strong arguments respective to each target
audience’s rankings: highest rated messages for both audiences, highest rated messages for target in-group,
highest rated messages for target out-group, and middle-/median-rated messages. We will cross those
message categories with target audience (White/Black American) to test if messages selected via the wiki
survey are associated with intentions to adhere to screening recommendations in the future and share CRCS
messages. The project will offer evidence to help determine the validity and scalability of these novel methods,
which is essential to innovate formative research and evaluation approaches in the future."

10795726,"ABSTRACT - Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative conditions are characterized by
heightened inflammation, neurodegeneration, and CNS vascular permeability, including microhemorrhage
formation. The role of specific immune cell types in the underlying neuropathology associated with AD and
other neurologic diseases remains an active area of research. Significant attention has been given to the role
of innate immune cells and microglia in the development of AD. However, the role of adaptive immune cells,
including CD8 T cells, has not been defined despite their presence in brain parenchyma of AD patients. These
findings were further accentuated by the recent analysis of CD8 T cell repertoire and correlation with disease
severity in human AD patients. APP/PS1 mice revealed significant brain infiltration of CD8 T cells of effector
phenotype. Similarly, our Co-investigator, Dr. John Fryer of Mayo Clinic Arizona, has also observed significant
CD8 T cell brain infiltration in his novel rAAV initiated tauopathy mouse model. Using our novel MHC class I
conditional knockout mice, we have determined that macrophages and dendritic cells prime non-equivalent
CD8 T cell responses in response to PbA infection. While both antigen presenting cells prime CD8 T cell
response that infiltrate the brain, only CD8 T cells raised by dendritic cells induce lethal blood-brain barrier
disruption. Our central hypothesis that clonally expanded CD8 T cells engage brain vasculature and
migratory antigen presenting cells during infiltration which contributes to neuropathology and
cognitive deficits in AD and Tauopathies. We plan to test this central hypothesis through execution of the
following specific aims:
Specific Aim 1 – Define the CD8 T cell repertoire and phenotype(s) generated in APP/PS1 and
Tauopathy mice through transcriptional profiling.
Specific Aim 2 – Determine critical role of residential and migratory APCs in priming and enabling CNS
infiltration of CD8 T cell responses in APP/PS1 and Tauopathy mouse models
Specific Aim 3 – Dissect the critical MHC class I expressing CNS cell type required for CD8 T cell
induced neuropathology and cognitive deficits
The proposed work is innovative because it capitalizes on our unique transgenic mouse models, novel imaging
methodology, and new core facilities available to our research program at Mayo Clinic. Our goal is to define
mechanistically the contribution of CD8 T cells in human dementia through knowledge gained using leading
experimental models. Beyond the innovative methodology employed, the concept that antigen presenting
cells raise differential CD8 T cell responses is highly novel and warrants further investigation to a mechanism
which is therapeutically targetable. This is especially important if CD8 T cell priming and engagement of
antigen presented by specific cell types is promoting neuropathology and behavioral deficits."

pivotal roles for TREM2, CD33, and CD22 in Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of age-related dementia. While
increasing evidence indicates that these innate immune receptors are critically involved in Alzheimer’s disease
progression, we still lack in-depth understanding of the intracellular signaling molecules employed by these
immune receptors to influence neurodegenerative disease. Identification of the signaling pathways involved in
the immune response to Alzheimer’s disease will help to reveal novel therapeutic targets and also provide new
insights into neurodegenerative disease pathoetiology. The SYK-CARD9 signaling axis has been shown to
control immune responses downstream of TREM2, CD33, and CD22 in other models of disease, although its
role in Alzheimer’s disease and most other neurodegenerative disorders still remains to be determined. In our
preliminary studies, we have found that genetic ablation of CARD9 in an amyloid beta (Ab)-mediated mouse
model of Alzheimer’s disease results in exacerbated cognitive decline, increased Ab deposition, and impaired
activation of microglia. We also show that disruption of either CARD9 or SYK leads to impaired phagocytosis of
Ab and other forms of neurotoxic debris associated with neurodegeneration. In further support of a role for SYK
in Alzheimer’s disease, recent in vitro studies have shown that Ab stimulation of macrophages promotes potent
activation of SYK signaling. Given these preliminary findings and others showing that SYK and CARD9 are
almost exclusively expressed by microglia in the brain, we hypothesize that the SYK-CARD9 signaling axis helps
to limit Ab-mediated neurological disease by promoting neuroprotective functions in brain-resident macrophages.
Leveraging a combination of unique transgenic mouse strains and human-induced pluripotent stem cells derived
from patients harboring loss-of-function CARD9 mutations, we will uncover how the SYK-CARD9 signaling axis
influences neurological disease in AD mouse models. Moreover, we will test whether therapeutic treatment with
known activators of the SYK-CARD9 signaling pathway is effective in limiting Ab-mediated disease progression.
Completion of the studies proposed in this application will break new ground in our understanding of the
molecular signaling pathways used by the innate immune system in Ab-mediated neurological disease and will
help to establish new molecular players that can be targeted in Alzheimer’s disease."

Our overarching goal is to construct heritability enhanced multimodal imaging endophenotypes, dissect their
associated genetic underpinnings, and characterize the pathological mechanism along with clinical profiles for
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) susceptibility and progression through a suite of statistically powerful, biologically
plausible and computationally efficient Bayesian models. AD is complex: its etiology is in no way clear and with
no available cure. Genetics play a dominate role in AD. However, genome wide association studies based on
AD susceptibility have only discovered a small number of independent genetic factors. Compared with
categorical diagnoses, imaging quantitative trait (QT) has distinct advantages to capture disease etiology and
their association on genetic variants has yielded some prominent finding. However, existing imaging genetics
studies suffer with i) inadequate power under current atlas-based imaging traits, ii) oversight of genetic
underpinnings across different brain processes and potential role of SNP-SNP interactions, and iii) unclear
pathological mechanism among genetics, imaging and clinical profiles, which limit their further advances to AD
research. To overcome these barriers, this project proposes the following four aims: 1) construct novel
multimodal imaging endophenotypes under “brain heritability parcellation'” for AD risk and progression; 2) identify
pleiotropic SNPs and SNP-SNP interactions under constructed multimodal brain biomarkers; 3) investigate the
fundamental pathological mechanism between genetic variations and AD pathology mediated by multimodal
imaging endophenotypes; and 4) perform systematic evaluation of the proposed methods through real data
analyses and simulations, and develop user-friendly analytical pipelines. Our proposed methods are innovative
in multiple aspects for and beyond AD biomedical research including a) to construct a novel brain heritability
parcellation, b) to integrate multimodal imaging on their association to genetic bases, c) to explore risk SNP-
SNP interaction along with common genetic variants in a coherent and scalable way, d) to consider genetic
pleiotrophy in a fine mapping framework, e) to establish pathological mechanism among individual’s genetic
variants and polygenic profile, brain activities and disease symptoms, f) to extend the proposed methods to
longitudinal settings with respect to AD progression, and g) to develop efficient and user friendly pipelines for
our products. A successful completion of this proposal will facilitate the identification of novel genetic variants
and characterize their impacts on AD pathogenesis, mediated by the constructed multimodal imaging biomarkers.
The development of innovative statistical methods and computational tools, and their implementation on the
ADNI and Yale ADRC cohort will offer a great potential for understanding the genetic and neurobiological
mechanisms of AD and advancing targeted prevention and treatment, paving the way for the development of
neurological and psychiatric research in general and benefit public health outcomes."

11034210,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There is currently a paucity of therapeutic approaches for ameliorating cognitive declines that characterize
neurodegeneration and aging. We have been investigating kynurenic acid, KYNA, a tryptophan derived
metabolite, as a nexus in metabolism, aging, and learning and memory in C. elegans. There is compelling
evidence from multiple species including C. elegans and mice that reductions in KYNA improve learning and
memory while increases in this neuromodulatory metabolite have detrimental effects. In both C. elegans and
mice KYNA accumulates with age. KYNA accumulation also characterizes several forms of human
neurodegeneration. We previously demonstrated that KYNA reducing genetic manipulations substantially
improve learning and memory even in aged animals or those with learning deficits. These improvements are
due to specific effects of KYNA on the activity of neurons that express N-methyl D-aspartate receptors
(NMDARs), fundamental regulators of learning and memory across phylogeny. These findings prompted us to
seek molecular mechanisms and pharmacological reagents for reducing KYNA to improve learning and
memory. We have identified androst-5-ene-3β,17β-diol (ADIOL), a C19 steroid hormone, as a potent enhancer
of learning capacity in C. elegans. We have demonstrated that ADIOL promotes learning in a KYNA and
NMDAR-dependent manner and that the effects of ADIOL are dependent on a nhr-91, a transcription factor
with both sequence and functional homology to mammalian estrogen receptor b, ER b. These findings are
intriguing for several reasons: first, the existence of ADIOL has long been recognized in mammals but the
physiological functions of this steroid hormone are extremely poorly understood. Second, there is compelling
evidence that activation of estrogen receptor b in mammals has numerous beneficial effects including on
enhancements of learning and memory but the underlying mechanisms for these effects are unknown. We
hypothesize that ADIOL serves as an endogenous ligand to activate an ER b-like nuclear hormone receptor,
which in turn causes reductions in KYNA to promote learning. Our objectives are to understand the molecular
mechanisms through which ADIOL treatment causes KYNA reduction as well as the physiological roles of
ADIOL. Our specific aims are to rigorously establish the role of ADIOL in learning and memory, devise
biochemical strategies for quantitating this difficult to measure steroid hormone from C. elegans, investigate
the role of nhr-91 as a mechanistic link between ADIOL and KYNA, and explore the hypothesis the
physiological roles of ADIOL include linking reproductive capacity and/or nutritional status to neural
mechanism of learning and memory. This investigation employs C. elegans molecular genetics, imaging,
behavioral assays, as well as biochemical measurements of metabolites."
10884094,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Memory loss in early Alzheimer disease (AD) appears when pathophysiology extends from entorhinal cortex
(EC) into hippocampal area CA1. CA1 processes EC input to generate hippocampal output, and bears the
brunt of hippocampal AD pathology. AD studies on CA1 have treated its pyramidal neurons (PNs) as a
homogeneous population. However, work from our and other groups established that CA1 PNs are diverse,
comprised of superficial (sPN) and deep (dPN) layers with unique roles in memory. The two layers show
differential changes in ischemia and epilepsy, but our knowledge of AD pathophysiology at this level is
incomplete. This limits our understanding of memory deficits in AD and our ability to correct dysfunction. This
knowledge can also advance our understanding of activity-dependent spread of AD and neurodegeneration
risk factors. Our published and preliminary data, and the literature, support a working hypothesis that dorsal
CA1 sPNs and dPNs exhibit contrasting pathophysiological and functional compromise due to amyloid and tau
pathology. The sPNs develop pathologic signs of aging, and show intrinsic and synaptic hypoexcitability in
aged and 3xTg-AD mice. The dPNs do not show these signs and become hyperexcitable. In human AD, the
sPN layer is more prone to plaques and tangles, and the two layers show proteomic differences related to
disease pathways and excitability. We test our hypothesis using amyloid (5xFAD) and tau (PS19) models to
separately address the effects of these pathologies on sPNs/dPNs at three levels. In Aim 1, we use in vitro
opto-electrophysiology to evaluate the impact of AD pathology on dorsal sPN- versus dPN-associated circuits.
This will relate cell and synaptic identity to the directionality and extent of physiologic change. We expect that
amyloid/tau induce hypoexcitability in sPN circuits and hyperexcitability in dPN circuits. In Aim 2, we use
miniscope GCaMP calcium imaging to determine the influence of AD pathology on dorsal sPN versus dPN
activity during hippocampal-dependent behavior. This will test the in vivo dominance of differential local circuit
changes in CA1 over globally reduced efferent input in the setting of memory deficits. We expect that sPNs are
more vulnerable to reductions in their in vivo activity during memory-guided behaviors. In Aim 3, we compare
proteomic changes in dorsal sPNs versus dPNs in the setting of AD pathology. This will link cell identity,
molecular markers of AD severity, and the degree/directionality of physiologic change. We expect that sPN
proteomes will show more severe changes in pathologic AD pathways. This work is significant by providing
new, cell-type specific, mechanistic knowledge about memory dysfunction in AD. This will also help link
physiologic change to development of pathology and neurodegeneration. These are critical steps towards
better treatments. Our strategy is innovative by combining multiple, state-of-the-art approaches to address
disease pathophysiology in distinct cell types at multiple biological levels: circuit, behavior, and molecular."

The primary objective of this application is to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms underlying odontogenesis
mediated by nonclassical β-catenin signaling. Tooth agenesis is the most common congenital dental
abnormality, characterized by the absence of one or more permanent teeth including Anodontia, Oligodontia,
and Hypodontia. Human genetic studies of nonsyndromic tooth agenesis have revealed approximately 16
causative genes of which 6 of them are involved in the Wnt pathway indicating its significance in disease
pathogenesis. Missing teeth are currently treated by dental implants, tooth transplants, or prosthodontic
repairs. However, they are not permanent treatments and also are associated with considerable complications.
For next-generation therapies, new regenerative approaches to interrupt tooth formation/maintenance or
develop an autologous tooth replacement are highly attractive concepts. Therefore, it is critical to advance our
knowledge of odontogenesis and elucidate the mechanisms underlying reciprocal interactions of dental
epithelium and mesenchyme. Canonical Wnt signaling mediated by β-catenin has been well established to
play an essential role in early odontogenesis. Mouse genetic studies have demonstrated the importance of Wnt
signaling in various aspects of dental medicine, e.g. tooth development, dental pulp, enamel, odontogenesis,
and amelogenesis. Expression of a degradation-deficient form of β-catenin causes continuous tooth generation
and development of supernumerary teeth, further suggesting that tooth renewal can be unlocked by increasing
the intrinsic level of odontogenic potential. β-catenin acts as a master regulator of this intrinsic potential to
promote tooth formation. However, β-catenin is a multifaced protein that possesses other functions in addition
to acting as a master regulator for transducing canonical Wnt signaling. Preliminary studies of our new genetic
models argue against current knowledge and implicate the requirement of nonclassical β-catenin in
odontogenesis. First, we will characterize new β-catenin mutant mice to rigorously assess the dual function of
β-catenin in the development of odontogenic ability, and differentiation of odontoblasts and ameloblasts.
Second, we will identify the master regulators acting downstream of β-catenin by a single-cell transcriptomic
approach to decipher the genetic regulatory network associated with the nonclassical signaling cascade. The
objective of this study has great significance in human health and regenerative dental medicine. Elucidating the
mechanism underlying the regulation of odontogenesis promises important insights into next-generation
therapy for dental restoration."
10891785,"Project Summary
Pursuant to my long-term research interest, understanding the transmembrane (TM) signaling of cell surface
receptors, the present proposal aims to elucidate the signaling mechanism of CD33, a key immune modulator
of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide clearance by microglia. The response of microglia, the resident phagocytes of the
central nervous system, to Aβ aggregates can be either phagocytotic and neuroprotective or inflammatory and
cytotoxic. This influence makes the innate immune response a major determinant of Alzheimer disease (AD)
pathogenesis. The activation state and phagocytosis capability of microglia correlate with signaling by the
CD33 cell-surface receptor. CD33 inactivation promotes phagocytosis and mitigates Aβ pathology, identifying
CD33 inhibition as a promising therapeutic AD avenue. CD33 belongs to the family of sialic acid-binding im-
munoglobulin-like receptor (Siglecs) and consists of two extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains (IgV and
IgC2), a single-pass transmembrane (TM) domain and a cytosolic (CS) domain. Here, we hypothesize that the
IgV-IgC2-TM domain-domain orientations and couplings change upon ligand binding, which transmits a signal
(structural change) to the CS domains. Aim 1 lays the structural and biochemical groundwork to test this hy-
pothesis. It establishes expression systems to produce isotope-labeled, glycosylated domains, determines their
structure, oligomerization state and membrane immersion by NMR spectroscopy. Aim 2 traces the structural
changes upon ligand binding from IgV to the CS domain in full-length CD33 reconstituted in phospholipid
bicelles to directly test our signaling hypothesis. Specifically, ligand-induced changes in structure, domain-
domain orientations and couplings will be established using NMR. The CD33 activity state will be verified in
cultured macrophages and structure-based point mutations will be examined to provide target sites for phar-
macological CD33 inhibition. Aim 3 examines the link between the CS domain and downstream signaling. The
binding motif and affinity of established CD33-binding proteins will be determined by ITC and NMR. This or-
ganizes the binding hierarchy of cytosolic ligands, identifies binders whose binding sequences overlap with se-
quences that experience structural perturbations upon receptor activation, and identifies additional CD33 can-
didate sequences for pharmacological intervention. While fragments of cell surface receptors with extracellular
ligand-binding domains have been studied at atomic resolution, the relatively small size of CD33 allows the first
study of an entire such receptor in solution. Delineating its complete signaling mechanism at atomic resolution
establishes a paradigm for receptor biology and provides novel insight into Siglec biology. The direct targeting
of Aβ amyloid as AD therapy has been largely unsuccessful and we provide CD33 target sites verified by cell
biology that can be translated to therapeutics to harness the great potential of optimizing the innate immune
response to combat AD."

10883904,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most persistent and devastating dementias, eventually leading to a
complete loss of memory and the inability to function independently. Despite the billions of US dollars invested
in the development of drugs for AD, there have been more setbacks and failures than treatment successes.
Drug repurposing has thus been proposed as one method to help advance AD drug development.
Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is a vital central nervous system (CNS) cofactor that maintains availability of the
amine neurotransmitters and nitric oxide synthesis, and modulates the glutamatergic system. Previous studies
have reported BH4 deficits in the periphery and CNS of AD patients; deficits comparable in size to those
reported for BH4 deficiency disorders and psychiatric illness, supporting their characterization as having
physiological significance.
The GCH1 gene encodes the rate-limiting enzyme in BH4 biosynthesis, and GCH1 polymorphisms have been
associated with cognitive ability in healthy individuals, and recently with AD. In our prelim studies, we showed
that psychiatric patients who harbor a variant in the GCH1 promotor have significantly lower GCH1 expression
in both the periphery and CNS, and concomitantly lower BH4. These data are particularly relevant given the
exciting results obtained from our first trial of synthetic BH4 treatment for psychiatric patients. We found a
significant genotype x treatment effect on the primary cognitive outcome (n=25, p=0.0093): Those patients with
the GCH1 variant and low BH4 levels had greater cognitive deficits at baseline and showed significant
improvement when treated with BH4, as compared to the other groups. Our trial data suggests that in those
with a BH4 deficit, BH4 treatment impacts the relatively intractable cognitive core feature of psychiatric illness.
Based upon these findings, we now hypothesize that differential expression of the GCH1 BH4 biosynthesis
gene (via functional GCH1 polymorphisms), leads to BH4 dysregulation (for example a BH4 deficit) that will be
associated with cognitive impairment in AD and MCI. We additionally hypothesize that synthetic BH4 or other
molecules that can upregulate the BH4 biosynthesis pathway, are potential repurposing agents for targeting
cognitive and functional impairments in patients with BH4 dysregulation. We will test these hypotheses under
the following Aims: Specific Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that dysregulation of BH4 biosynthesis leads to
physiologically-relevant dysregulation of BH4 availability, that predicts levels of cognitive impairment in patients
with AD and MCI. Specific Aim 2: To test the molecular and biochemical efficacy of clinically available drugs
to boost BH4 and rescue the neurotransmitter deficits observed in mouse models of Gch1 downregulation,
overlaid onto an AD phenotype. Specific Aim 3: To target cognition via BH4 rescue in the AD animal models.
Impact: If successful, this study would ascertain a population of patients whose cognition would benefit from
therapeutics specifically targeting BH4 dysregulation, and would form the basis of future RCTs of AD and MCI."

We seek to establish a new resource-based Center to foster and support research and training aimed at
understanding the mechanisms underlying pain associated with musculoskeletal (MSK) and rheumatic diseases,
with the ultimate goal of better managing and preventing it. One third of the world’s population is affected by
chronic pain, and the MSK system is the most prevalent source of pain and disability. Currently available
analgesic drugs act on a limited number of targets, and they do not provide sustained pain relief and their chronic
use is associated with serious adverse effects. One of the major obstacles in identifying safe and efficacious
drugs for producing pain relief is our general lack of understanding of the mechanisms underlying MSK pain, and
how these mechanisms may overlap or differ between different types of rheumatic and MSK diseases. The
Chicago Center on Musculoskeletal Pain (C-COMP) will address this need in a timely and unique manner,
capitalizing on the world class expertise that is available to us in the areas of MSK research, pain and
neurobiology to achieve the following broad long-term goals: (1) To integrate basic, translational and clinical
expertise in a multidisciplinary Center which will provide the leadership and resources for promoting MSK pain
research; (2) To enhance the research environment for the MSK research community by providing access to
world-class expertise and state-of-the-art resources, technologies, and infrastructure for studying pain; (3) To
promote interdisciplinary research between the MSK research field and the field of pain/neuroscience; (4) To
expand the MSK pain research community by attracting early career as well as established researchers into this
area of study. We envision three Cores operating in support of these overall goals. The Administrative Core A
(PI: A.M. Malfait; co-director: J.J. Jacobs) will provide leadership, maintain effective communication, partner with
related Centers to stimulate human translation of findings, and implement a dynamic enrichment program. The
Behavioral Resource Core B (PI: R.E. Miller; co-director: D.R. Sumner) will provide a centralized resource to
facilitate behavioral assays in a broad array of animal models of rheumatic and MSK diseases, including training
for behavioral tests, access to customized protocols, equipment, and space to perform testing, a consultation
service and a customized, full-service option for behavioral testing. The Neurobiology Core C (PI: RJ Miller; co-
director: D.R. Sumner) will offer state-of-the-art techniques for assessment and manipulation of neuronal circuitry
involved in pain physiology, such as in vivo calcium imaging, electrophysiology, chemo/optogenetics,
transcriptomics/bioinformatics and neuroanatomical techniques. This will allow the Center’s research community
to engage in cutting-edge investigations of the mechanisms of pain in animal models of MSK disease. In
summary, C-COMP will provide (1) unique resources and infrastructure for supporting high-quality externally
funded research and (2) pilot funding, education, and training in a multidisciplinary and collaborative fashion.
This integrated approach is expected to accelerate research in pain associated with MSK and rheumatic disease."
10892761,"Finding a cure for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one the greatest scientiﬁc challenges of our time. There is a
growing realization that experimental treatments should target the earliest, presymptomatic stages of disease.
But the cost of conducting clinical trials in participants who may not develop symptoms of AD for years can
be prohibitive. There is a growing need for more eﬀective biomarkers of AD, particularly biomarkers of
therapeutic eﬃcacy that can detect slowing or reversal of AD-related changes due to treatment as early in the
clinical trial as possible. These biomarkers must be as sensitive as possible to disease progression and also
account for AD heterogeneity, i.e., the fact that the majority of individuals who have AD pathology also have
one or more concomitant pathologies that may aﬀect their ability to respond to experimental treatments for
AD. This proposal focuses on deriving eﬀective presymptomatic and early symptomatic AD biomarkers from
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the imaging modality that provides the most direct evidence of neuritic
and neuronal loss in neurodegenerative disease. Rather than propose new MRI acquisition protocols, we
focus on the most commonly collected type of MRI scan in AD research (T1-weighted 3D gradient echo scans
with approximately 1x1x1mm3 resolution) and use advanced computational analysis to quantify changes in
the subregions of the medial temporal lobe (MTL), the brain region that associated with early stages of AD
pathology as well as with early stages of multiple concomitant non-AD pathologies. Aim 1 will develop and
validate advanced algorithms that combine conventional multi-atlas segmentation with deep learning to
reliably extract small subregions of the MTL, such as Brodmann area 35, explicitly accounting for anatomical
variability in the MTL. Aim 2 will correlate quantitative digital pathology measures derived at autopsy with
antemortem MRI to discover distinct patterns of change that we hypothesize are associated with concomitant
pathologies in AD, including TDP-43 pathology, alpha-synucleinopathy, non-AD tauopathies, and
cerebrovascular disease. Aim 3 will apply deep learning to improve the sensitivity of measures of change in
longitudinal MRI, hypothetically leading to a more sensitive early marker of treatment eﬀectiveness in trials
targeting preclinical AD than existing cognitive and imaging-based measures. Taken together, improved
precision of segmentation (Aim 1), determination of spatial patterns of AD and concomitant non-AD pathology
(Aim 2), and advanced longitudinal measurement methodology (Aim 3) will optimize MTL subregional
sensitivity and speciﬁcity for the earliest neurodegenerative changes of AD, providing a potentially critical
therapeutic eﬃcacy measure to accelerate clinical trials of disease modifying treatments in early AD."

academic medical centers (Children’s National Hospital (lead), George Washington University, Howard
University, and Georgetown University). Our specific aims are: 1) To identify the causes and develop new
clinical approaches for the prevention or amelioration of IDDs; 2) To provide accessible, state-of-the-art,cost-
effective core facilities for cohesive, multidisciplinary research and education/training in IDDR; 3) To create
an intellectual home for investigators engaged in IDDR; and 4) To implement an innovative Research Project
that addresses two IDDR themes (Interventions and Management of Co-morbid Mental Health Conditions;
Outcome Measures or Biomarkers for Interventions or Treatments). The DC-IDDRC Director, Vittorio Gallo,
PhD, is an internationally renowned neuroscientist who will direct the Administrative Core that functions as
the organizing nexus of the DC-IDDRC, providing management, administration, communication and training,
assuring compliance and quality assurance, directing strategic planning and recruitment, and promoting the
growth of the DC-IDDRC. The scientific cores provide an integrated platform and synergy for investigation,
as required by truly translational IDDR. The Clinical Translational Core (CTC) is designed to serve as a “one-
stop-shop” for IDDR investigators, assisting at each stage of the clinical and translational research spectrum
and optimizing the efficient, high quality implementation of fundamental research. The Genomics and
Bioinformatics Core (GBC) provides advanced genomics technologies and specialized statistical analyses
for DNA and mRNA studies. The Cell and Tissue Microscopy Core (CTMC) supports investigators with a
broad array of advanced cellular/molecular imaging tools for state-of-the-art neuroscience studies. The
Human and Animal Imaging Core (HAIC) provides scientific and technical support for in vivo/ex vivo whole
brain imaging, image processing, and image analysis for human and animal studies. The Neurobehavioral
Evaluation Core (NEC) provides sophisticated neurobehavioral research support to define developmental
and behavioral phenotypes in humans and animals. Our project “Intervention-induced plasticity of flexibility
and learning mechanisms in ASD” utilizes the CTC, HAIC and NEC. Through these components, the DC-
IDDRC will enhance the recruitment and training of investigators, generate innovation, and promote
transdisciplinary research to facilitate the development, implementation, and dissemination of new diagnostic
and therapeutic advances for the care of individuals with IDDs."

Although Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an age-associated neurodegenerative disease, continuing evidence
demonstrates pathophysiology outside of the brain. This suggests a more complex process of disease with
systemic manifestations as well. Numerous studies now demonstrate that changes in the oral cavity have a
relationship with AD. Human patients have elevated salivary Aβ concentrations and reported problems with
saliva flow. In addition, periodontal disease, tooth loss, and overall poor oral health are all positive risk factors
for AD. This suggests that AD and periodontal health may have a reciprocal relationship. Using two different
transgenic mouse amyloidosis models of AD, APP/PS1 and AppNL-G-F mice, we verified not only Aβ secretion in
saliva, but a unique disease-associated oral microbiome and enamel thinning and increased cavities compared
to wild type controls. Based upon these findings and prior work by others, we hypothesize that that oral cavity
changes are a peripheral manifestation of AD contributing to disease progression. We will continue using the
AppNL-G-F mouse line to fully define oral health across age and disease stage in the first aim. In the second aim
we will determine whether salivary secretion of Aβ is needed for the oral dysbiosis and decline in oral health in
the AD line. In the third aim we will determine whether the oral dysbiosis is specifically responsible for the
decline in oral health and brain presentation of disease in the mice. This study will define an innovative
mechanism demonstrating that oral cavity dysbiosis and dysfunction is a characteristic of disease which also
contributes to AD progression. We expect to find that salivary Aβ secretion contributes to oral dysbiosis and
changing the oral microbiome is sufficient to ameliorate disease presentation in the brain. This will demonstrate
a new bi-directional understanding of disease involving a mouth-brain axis."
10884083,"Emerging Role of Tau Citrullination During Alzheimer’s disease and Tauopathies
Human tauopathies are a group of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), for which no
disease modifying therapies exist. Tau proteinopathic phenotypes show a spectrum of pathological hallmarks
and clinical syndromes. There is increasing recognition that post-translational modifications (PTMs) promote
strain or conformational assemblies that contribute to tauopathies, signifying a need to understand how novel
PTMs contribute to tauopathy risk. Protein citrullination (citR), induced by peptidyl arginine deiminases (PADs),
leads to an irreversible PTM that alters protein structure/ function by neutralizing positively charged arginine
residues within proteins. We discovered that aberrant tau activates PAD4 in neurons (protein PAD4, gene
PADi4); tau is client of PAD4 and is citrullinated at 14 arginine residues and those changes are associated with
reduced tau fibrillization; citR prevents tau phosphorylation of key epitopes and impacts tau clearance; and tau
citR is elevated in AD and in animal models of tauopathy. Our central hypothesis argues that increased PAD4-
induced tau citR prevents higher-order fibrillization, which decreases tangle formation, alters tau metabolism,
impacts structure/ function, and reduces seeding activity. Assumptions of this model will be tested in vivo and in
vitro by neuronal PADi4 overexpression and conditional knockout mice, multiple biochemical techniques,
electrophysiologic, and behavioral approaches. We will establish how neuronal PADi4 expression impacts tau
neuropathologic changes. Aim 1 will advance our understanding for PADi4 gain/ loss of function to establish the
foundation for citR tau biology and the impact on behavior in different models of tauopathy. We will establish
how citR regulates tau biochemistry and biology in cellular models. Aim 2 will mechanistically determine how
PAD4-induced citR tau alters tau clearance, aggregation, seeding and microtubule binding. We will establish the
spatio-temporal signature of citR tau in common human tauopathies. Aim 3 will provide the qualitative framework
and seeding activity of citR tau in common human tauopathies. The proposed work provides the necessary
foundation in not only better characterizing the role of citR in tauopathies, but also further establishing the first
mechanistic cause for loss and gain of function of PAD4 during tau pathogenesis. Overall, our application
describes a new tau PTM and provide a therapeutic strategy for a new pathway in tau biology and in AD."

10695870,"ABSTRACT
 The principal goal of this competitive renewal is to establish clinical brain tumor perfusion imaging protocols
strategically designed for high accuracy, physiologic sensitivity and clinical applicability. Dynamic susceptibility
contrast (DSC) MRI is one of the most widely used advanced imaging techniques in neuro-oncology, with a
reported use of 85% in all routine brain tumor scans at sites across the US and Europe. During the previous
funding cycle, the singular aim of the project was to identify the most accurate DSC-MRI acquisition protocol(s)
by developing, validating and applying a population-based digital reference object (DRO) and then verifying
these protocols in patients with brain tumors. The most significant finding of this effort was the identification and
clinical validation of an accurate single contrast agent dose and single-echo DSC-MRI protocol, which has now
been adopted as the consensus recommendation by the brain tumor imaging community. Another key result of
this project was the validation, using the DRO and a prospective patient study, of a single-dose, dual-echo DSC-
MRI sequence, an approach that enables simultaneous assessment of DSC and dynamic contrast enhanced
(DCE)-MRI data, as the protocol with highest accuracy, even across variable pulse sequence parameters and
tissue properties. Building on the success of this prior work, we now aim to overcome two obstacles that still limit
DSC-MRI’s clinical utility, accuracy, and multi-site consistency: i) a reliance on echo planar imaging (EPI) based
pulse sequences that undermine the geometric fidelity, reliable colocalization of perfusion and anatomic images
and accuracy of derived DCE-MRI data, and ii) lack of validation of, and a benchmark for, brain tumor DSC/DCE-
MRI post-processing algorithms and software, for both single- and dual-echo acquisitions. These limitations
represent critical and clinically relevant challenges that urgently need to be addressed. To address these issues,
we propose to: 1) establish an anthropomorphic benchmark for validating brain tumor DSC DCE-MRI analysis
tools and 2) develop a three-dimensional, dual-echo pulse sequence for simultaneous DSC/DCE MRI. In this
project we will provide the neuro-oncology community with validated image acquisition and analysis methods for
accurate, physiologic sensitive and clinically applicable DSC/DCE-MRI mapping methods in brain tumor patients.
We will provide the first DSC/DCE-MRI anthropomorphic benchmark that can be used to validate existing and
future algorithms and software, thereby improving multi-site and clinical trial consistency. Ultimately, validated
DSC-MRI techniques will improve its reliability and relevancy across a range of clinical scenarios, including tumor
localization, therapy response assessment, surgical and biopsy guidance, and multi-site clinical trials of
conventional and targeted brain tumor therapies."

The Penn Skin Biology and Diseases Resource-based Center (Penn SBDRC) will continue to support and
accelerate skin disease research and its translation by providing critical infrastructure, resources, and expertise
to skin investigators. The overall goals of the Penn SBDRC are to promote collaboration among skin
investigators, especially across disciplines; to draw new investigators with diverse perspectives to skin
research; to foster an environment that supports and cultivates the next generation of skin researchers; to
increase access to technology and resources for conducting rigorous, impactful skin research; and to
accelerate translation of research findings into innovative therapies for skin disease. To accomplish these
goals, the aims of the Center are: Aim 1) To provide cutting-edge approaches and related expertise centered
around 3 multi-disciplinary Resource Cores: Cutaneous Phenomics and Transcriptomics (CPAT) Core, Skin
Translational Research (STaR) Core, and Data Science and Informatics (DSI) Core. These Cores are highly
synergistic, providing high-demand and/or specialized services, valuable tissue/cellular resources, and the
expertise to ensure rigorous experimental design, analytical strategies, and accurate interpretations. All Cores
take advantage of the deep expertise of the Directors and Co-Directors and their research groups, to
continuously improve and innovate upon techniques/approaches offered by the Center. Aim 2) To establish an
Administrative Core that unifies skin investigators and promotes the goals of the SBDRC. The Administrative
Core provides oversight and implements the activities of the center. This includes an Enrichment Program that
is subdivided into 4 Sub-Cores: The Community Outreach Sub-Core introduces underserved Philadelphia
public high school students to the excitement of biomedical research and dermatology through the Penn
Academy of Skin Health (PASH), a Saturday academy and summer internship program. These programs also
provide volunteer and mentorship opportunities for SBDRC members; The Mentoring Sub-Core promotes
career success and training through structured mentorship for trainees and junior faculty. Through a
partnership with the Dermatology Department’s Committee on Diversity and Inclusion, specialized mentoring
programs for women and minorities underrepresented in medicine will be provided, as well as training for
SBDRC mentors. The Scientific Enrichment Sub-Core sponsors a seminar series, workshops, and a yearly
scientific symposium to promote interactions, collaboration, and innovative approaches among skin
researchers. The Seed Funding Sub-Core offers 3 different funding mechanisms that attract new investigators
and support the independence of junior investigators. The Penn SBDRC leverages the excellence of Penn
Dermatology’s research and clinical programs as well as that of the entire Penn community to enhance
collaboration, bringing new technology to skin research, and providing access to critical intellectual and
technical resources that greatly enhance innovation and rigor in the study of skin disease. The Center impacts
skin research well beyond Pennsylvania’s borders, and ultimately advances the treatment, prevention, and
diagnosis of skin diseases."
10868633,"The Penn Center for Musculoskeletal Disorders (PCMD) will continue to provide critical resources and
programs to, and enhance research productivity of, investigators to address multidisciplinary research
strategies for musculoskeletal problems. The overall goal of this Center is to promote cooperative interactions
among investigators, accelerate and enrich the effectiveness and efficiency of ongoing research, foster new
collaborations and new research, and ultimately, translate our research efforts into better and new therapies for
musculoskeletal disorders. The Center theme is “Musculoskeletal Development, Disease, Injury and Repair”
while addressing 3 Research Thrust areas. Our PCMD is the home for musculoskeletal research across the
Penn campus and a hub for the musculoskeletal community across the region and neighboring states .
 One focus of our Center is to bridge themes, approaches, and paradigms across musculoskeletal tissues
which may be overlooked when studying a single tissue. Since approaches used to evaluate mechanisms in
one tissue could aid researchers in other areas, our Center will foster this critical cross-talk. To further focus,
we will emphasize small animal models utilizing unique and sophisticated methods that cross length scales.
The PCMD will provide unique expertise and tools to investigate musculoskeletal tissues across such scales.
 Thus, the primary overall Aims of this Center remain to enhance and advance the research productivity of
investigators in musculoskeletal development, disease, injury and repair by providing: Aim 1: Innovation within
critical resource core facilities in areas that cross disciplines, length scales, and hierarchies. These core
facilities remain µCT Imaging, Biomechanics, and Histology; Aim 2: A pilot and feasibility grant program, with
direct mentorship; and Aim 3: Educational and research enrichment programs, through which members can
learn from national leaders and from each other. High quality musculoskeletal research is being conducted by
many groups at Penn, in the region, and neighboring states. While many bring sophisticated approaches to
musculoskeletal problems, few have the required expertise and facilities to perform the broad range of rigorous
and specialized assays in their own labs. The Center will provide opportunities to integrate techniques to define
mechanisms for tissue function, injury, development, degeneration, repair, and regeneration, with the ultimate
goal of advancing diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases and injuries of the musculoskeletal system.
There is also an intangible feature of our Center. Although our musculoskeletal program is strong nationally,
the Penn biomedical research community is large and diverse. As such, the Center serves as an essential
mechanism to highlight our successes and the importance of musculoskeletal research across campus, as well
as to institutional leadership. Having a strong voice for musculoskeletal researchers for our region is critical to
support our collective and individual research goals. In these ways, the Center - with essential support from the
P30 - has become and remains an indispensable resource and advocate for our community."
10891790,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Recently, significant progress in understanding Tau aggregation and how Tau aggregates lead
to neurodegeneration has been made by the description of the atomic structures of Tau filaments
isolated from brain. The atomic models of Tau in Alzheimer disease (AD), Pick disease,
Corticobasal degeneration, and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy were determined by cryo-
electron microscopy (cryo-EM) through an ongoing collaborative effort between our laboratory at
Indiana University and the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology. Additional Tau structures are
also currently being identified in a collaborative effort between Indiana University and Purdue
University. The studies proposed in this MPI application are a logical continuation of this
groundbreaking work. The main goals of this project are to elucidate the structural basis and
pathological mechanisms implicated in Gerstmann-Sträussler-Sheinker (GSS, F198S) disease
and Prion protein cerebral amyloid angiopathy (PrP-CAA, Q160X), in which Tau deposits are
composed by 3R+4R Tau, as in AD. We will determine the atomic structure of Tau through cryo-
EM, the role of post-translational modifications of Tau filaments in relation to structure and perform
in vitro and in vivo analysis of Tau seeding and propagation. The investigation of what drives the
specificity of Tau conformers in Tau pathology is an essential step toward the design of novel
diagnostic and therapeutic molecules."
10903795,"Michigan Integrative Musculoskeletal Health Core Center - Overview
Project Summary
Musculoskeletal disorders remain an enormous public healthcare problem, accounting for more than fifty percent
of chronic conditions in developed countries. The current financial landscape not only challenges investigator-
led scientific programs, but particularly threatens collaborative research because lack of flexibility in individual
budgets restricts resources and ability to share valuable techniques with our scientific neighbors. The Michigan
Integrative Musculoskeletal Health Core Center (MiMHC) enables vertically integrated, multi-scale
musculoskeletal science from molecular and omic-level mechanisms to organismal function and clinical
outcomes by increasing access to critical, specialized resources and expertise that are fundamental to the
musculoskeletal research programs of 90 Center investigators. The MiMHC is structured to be consistent with
initiatives at the University of Michigan aimed at promoting collaborations across disciplines and between basic
scientists and clinicians to promote health by better understanding disease and injury mechanisms. The MiMHC
not only enhances the capabilities of a group of outstanding musculoskeletal researchers but also leverages
their collective talent through an Enrichment Program that promotes novel and emerging musculoskeletal
research in cross-tissue interactions and sex-specific differences throughout the life course. An outreach
program creates a rich community of musculoskeletal scientists through a novel monthly seminar series that
builds on existing momentum toward accelerating discussion, critical thinking, research rigor and reproducibility,
and innovation. To accomplish these goals, an Administrative Core will oversee core operations and three
Resource Cores to provide Structure, Composition, and Histology services, Functional assessment services,
and Integrative Data Analytics services to all members of the MiMHC research community. The Resource Cores
are structured to facilitate hierarchically mechanistic studies from the molecular and omic-levels through the
organ-level and to the clinical setting. Access to the Resource Cores has been and will continue to be financially
and scientifically impactful to Center investigators by centralizing core technologies and by providing access to
Core Directors who are experts in their field and who will provide guidance on the best choice of technologies,
experimental design, and data interpretation. The UM environment is ideal for continuing to build a strong
research community and to sustain an innovative, collaborative venture aimed at advancing understanding of
musculoskeletal health and disease and to conduct science highly relevant to the NIAMS mission."
10819144,"PROJECT SUMMARY – TEXAS DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER FOR AIDS RESEARCH
In 2019, the US announced a plan to End the HIV Epidemic by 2030. To be successful, strategies that improve
HIV prevention and HIV treatment outcomes are needed. Only 56% of people with HIV (PWH) were virally
suppressed in 2018, a critical determinant of health outcomes and transmission risk, and 51% of HIV
diagnoses in 2018 were in the US South, despite constituting only 38% of the population in the US. Texas is
the second most populous state in the US, behind California, with about 29 million residents, and is in the US
South as defined by CDC and the Census Bureau. Unfortunately, this large Texas population, coupled with
weaker public health and prevention policies and funding across the US South, has a growing HIV population
that lags in critical health outcomes. There is an urgent need for more research and research infrastructure to
combat the HIV epidemic in the US South and specifically in Texas to both contribute to ending the US HIV
epidemic and to learn how to best do that in resource constrained areas of the US. We therefore will establish
a Texas Developmental Center for AIDS Research (D-CFAR) to support the overall mission of the national
CFAR program by facilitating high-priority HIV research and supporting the effort to end the HIV epidemic in
the US. Three institutions have collaborated to propose this D-CFAR: Baylor College of Medicine in Houston,
The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston and the Texas Biomedical Research Institute in

10883951,"We have previously reported that microglia and extracellular vesicles (EVs) play pivotal roles in tau
propagation. Our findings have been reproduced in numerous studies showing involvement of microglia and
EVs in the development of tau pathology in animal models and human biospecimens. During the current
funded period (1RF1 AG054199), we identified: 1) Enrichment of glial and disease-associated proteins in
Alzheimer’s disease brain-derived EVs (AD EVs) compared to control EVs, 2) Highly transmissible nature of
AD EVs demonstrated by increased neuronal uptake and tau aggregation potency, 3) Robust tau propagation
throughout the entire hippocampus by inoculating AD EVs containing just 300 pg of tau in aged C57BL/6
mouse brains. We have yet to elucidate the underlying mechanism of AD EVs gaining pathogenic functions.
We hypothesize that Ab-induced inflammatory conditions in AD leads to microglial activation, which alters
molecular compositions of microglial EVs, leading to their increased transmission to neurons. APOE4
enhances this process by augmented Ab deposition and MGnD induction. The hypothesis has been developed
based on the previous studies and our preliminary data showing that (1) Clec7a+ neurodegenerative microglia
(MGnD) surrounding Ab plaques play a key role in accelerating tau propagation in APPNL-G-F/NL-G-F knock-in
(APP KI) mice; (2) MGnD upregulates EV markers; (3) AD EVs and APP mouse brain-derived EVs show
elevated MGnD and cell adhesion molecules compared to controls; (4) AD EVs show increased tau seeding
activity and neuronal uptake compared to controls, which is exacerbated in APOE4 over non-APOE4 AD
cohorts; and (5) APOE4 knock-in APP/PS1 mice accelerates Ab deposition, microglial activation, and
expression of MGnD markers compared to APOE3 knock-in APP/PS1 mice. The rationale of the proposed
research is that identification of EV protein and lipid composition uniquely expressed in AD and APOE4
background will serve as the basis of molecular understanding of EV-mediated disease progression. Our study
will fill the missing link between MGnD induction and tau propagation by microglial tau-seeding EV production.
In Aim 1, we will delineate the chemical and molecular structure of aggregation-prone tau in AD EVs and tau-
interacting molecules. We will also characterize the protein and lipid compositions of EVs from APOE4/4 and
APOE3/3 EVs to characterize the difference in cellular origin, involvement of inflammatory and toxic molecules,
and tau seeding activity in vitro and in vivo. In Aim 2, we will knock down Apoe, involved in microglial activation
and Smpd3, involved in EV synthesis, to determine the role of MGnD induction and glial EV production on tau
propagation. In Aim 3, we will differentiate isogenic human iPSCs in APOE3/3 and APOE4/4 background to
microglia-like cells (iMGL), and characterize pathogenicity of iMGL EVs under MGnD condition. We will
perform proteomic and lipidomic profiling of iMGL EVs to validate our findings from human AD EVs in Aim 1.
The proposed work is expected to obtain the fundamental molecular bases for EV biology in tauopathy."

10874723,"Overall – Project Summary
The Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) was founded at Wake Forest School of Medicine (WFSM)
in 2016 to provide a comprehensive infrastructure for research on the pathophysiology, prevention, and
treatment of AD and related disorders (ADRD). The theme of our ADRC is to better understand early
transitions from normal aging to MCI and dementia, and to elucidate the role that metabolic and vascular
factors play in these transitions, through coordinated research activities spanning the translational spectrum.
No current therapies effectively prevent or treat the symptoms of AD. This chasm highlights the need to identify
antecedent biomarkers and risk factors that predict later-life vulnerability or resilience, in order to develop
strategies for prevention and early intervention. Metabolic and vascular disorders are powerful modifiable
factors that may contribute to the transitions from normal aging to MCI and ADRD. Such disorders are
epidemic in the Southeastern region surrounding the WF ADRC; more than 70% of adults over the age of 50
have prediabetes, diabetes, or hypertension. These disorders increase the risk of cognitive impairment and
dementia through complex interactions that are poorly understood. The WF ADRC seeks to provide resources
to better understand these interactions. We also seek to elucidate the multi-dimensional role that health
disparities play in influencing risk for AD. We emphasize engagement of African Americans and other
underrepresented groups, who are twice as likely to develop dementia, and have high rates of diabetes and
vascular disease. To promote innovative research on metabolic/vascular risk and health disparities, our
Outreach, Recruitment and Engagement and Clinical Cores have partnered to enroll and follow ~600
participants, carefully characterizing their vascular and glycemic status. Participants receive magnetic
resonance imaging and amyloid and tau positron emission tomography overseen by the Imaging Biomarker
Core. Valuable samples and data from this cohort are made widely available to the National Alzheimer’s
Coordinating Center, the National Centralized Repository for AD and other investigators by the Data
Management and Statistical Analysis and Neuropathology Cores, providing invaluable resources to address
numerous National Alzheimer’s Project Act milestones. The Neuropathology Core has also characterized novel
nonhuman primate models with methods that parallel the ADRC’s human cohort to promote translational
research. Finally, the ADRC and its Research Education Component provide training relating to AD, metabolic/
vascular factors and health disparities to a diverse cadre of new researchers, and education for patients and
families, health professionals, and the community. The prevalence of metabolic and vascular risk factors, their
role in onset, progression, and heterogeneity of ADRDs, and the strengths of the WF ADRC in these research
areas, ensure that we will make high-impact contributions to the search for strategies to treat and prevent AD."

The Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center (Buffett Cancer Center or BCC), an NCI-designated Cancer Center
since 1984, is committed to basic, translational, clinical and population science research, comprehensive
educational programs, and outreach to underserved communities in our catchment area (Nebraska). The new
BCC integrated cancer research and care facility increased Cancer Center-controlled research space 1.7-fold
(total 400,000 sq ft), creating an environment which fosters scientific innovation and transdisciplinary
collaborations. The Cancer Center is fully integrated into the university and its affiliated healthcare network,
Nebraska Medicine (NM), with the Director reporting directly to the UNMC Chancellor and CEO NM and
appointed BCC Physician-in-Chief. Two Cancer Center leadership positions were established since the last
review, Deputy Director and Associate Director for Community Outreach and Engagement (COE), with the latter
leading efforts to reduce cancer burden and disparities in diverse communities across Nebraska. The BCC also
appointed four new senior leaders and eliminated dual leadership roles to promote clinical and translational
research. The centralization, expansion and reorganization of the BCC Clinical Trials Office was completed and
a new CTMS (OnCore) installed, culminating in a 1.8-fold increase in accrual to interventional clinical trials.
Research infrastructure was enhanced by the addition of a new Preclinical Imaging Shared Resource as well as
several new resources (e.g., Metabolomics, Organoids, Patient-Derived Models, Tissue Microarrays, Synthetic
and Medicinal Chemistry, and Computational Chemistry). The BCC has three Research Programs: Cancer
Biology Program (CBP); Targets, Modulators and Delivery Program (TMDP); and GI Cancer Program (GICP).
Two programs, CBP and TMDP, changed names, reflecting the strategic realignment of their missions, themes
and memberships. With 28 Members recruited during the current funding period, the BCC has a robust track
record of clinical and translational research supported by 14 multidisciplinary awards (P01, P50, P20s, U awards;
6 from NCI) and 16 new MPI awards (11 from NCI). Cancer-relevant peer-reviewed research funding in the BCC
increased 1.4-fold to $25.3M (Annual Direct Costs) and NCI funding increased 1.3-fold to $12.5 M (Annual Direct
Costs) since our last review."

10880721,"OVERALL — PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Over the last 20 years, Arizona researchers established NIA's first statewide Alzheimer's Disease Center and
the nation's most extensive statewide collaboration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. They made pioneering
contributions to the unusually early detection, tracking and study of AD and the accelerated evaluation of AD
prevention therapies. The Center includes researchers from seven organizations, six in the Phoenix metropolitan
area and one in Tucson. It has supported 150 researchers from organizations across the state and helping them
to generate more than $2 billion in new grants, contracts, philanthropic, state and organizational investments.
The Arizona AD Research Center (ADRC) will capitalize on the Center's leadership, statewide collaborative
model, major organizational commitments, and extensively shared scientific resources and its very existence to
make the scientific fight against AD a top priority in the state. Its resources, strategic plan, and related programs
and prevention trials are specifically intended to set the stage for promising blood tests to transform AD/ADRD
research, treatment development, and care, include persons from diverse backgrounds, find an effective
prevention therapy by 2025, and fulfill National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) goals. We will use ADRC,
organizational and philanthropic funds to provide an extraordinary resource of data and blood samples for
neuropathological study and diagnostic validation of BBBs for ADRD using blood samples from several hundred
brain donors in the last years of life who have comprehensive neuropathological assessments after they die. The
overall goals of the Center will be accomplished through coordinated activities of its six Cores and the Research
Education Component (REC). The Administrative Core will provide the scientific leadership to the ADRC as a
whole. The multi-site Clinical Core will perform standard evaluations and collect UDS and additional data on all
participants, including a large number of Hispanic/Latino and Native American participants. The Neuropathology
Core will provide neuropathologic diagnoses and process, store and distribute postmortem brain tissue, including
from those who provided blood samples in the last 1-2 years of their lives. The Biomarker Core will support and
provide access to genetics, brain imaging (MRI, amyloid PET, tau PET), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and BBBs of
AD. The Outreach, Recruitment and Engagement (ORE) Core will support the efforts of the Clinical and
Neuropathology Core, providing a range of educational and outreach programs for healthy adults, patients and
family caregivers in our Center's catchment area, including from Arizona's large Hispanic/Latino and Native
American communities. The Data Management and Statistics Core will support all the data management,
informatics and statistical needs of the Cores and Center. The REC will coordinate closely with each of the Cores
and leverage external partnership with two Resource Centers for Minority Aging Research (RCMARs) to attract
and support the development of new researchers and clinicians. Together these activities will help set the stage
for BBBs to revolutionize ADRD research, treatment and care, inform the study of preclinical AD, and help
provide the best possible change to find and support the approval of an AD prevention therapy in 2025."
10870013,"Penn ADRC Overall Project Summary
The mission of the University of Pennsylvania’s Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (Penn ADRC) is to
increase research and education on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and its links to related dementias (ADRD) with
the goal of identifying the causes of and cures for AD/ADRD. To do so, the Penn ADRC will address one of the
fundamental barriers to effective treatment or prevention, which is the significant phenotypic, pathological, and
sociodemographic heterogeneity of AD. We will embrace and seek to characterize and understand this
heterogeneity to ultimately achieve a precision medicine approach leading to targeted interventions that will
facilitate realization of the National Alzheimer’s Project Act’s (NAPA) ambitious goal of effective prevention or
treatment by 2025. Indeed, the Penn ADRC is constructed to directly contribute to a number of the milestones
of NAPA necessary to achieve this goal.
 Emerging from the 30-year history of the Penn Alzheimer’s Disease Core Center (ADCC), the Penn ADRC
benefits from a rich scientific milieu in which there is significant integration and collaboration across Penn’s
neurodegenerative disease centers. This construction is critical to the understanding of AD heterogeneity
which is driven, in part, by overlapping pathologies and mechanisms, such that cross-degenerative disease
studies are of increasing importance in capturing the full spectrum of disease. This environment has led to a
history of transformative research that has influenced understanding of disease definition and mechanisms,
diagnostic approaches and biomarker development, statistical and bioinformatics methodology, and ethical,
social and legal perspectives of those suffering from this condition and their care partners. It has also created
an intellectual, cultural, and physical setting dedicated to training the next generation of investigators and
clinicians, as well as partnering and educating the community.
 To achieve our mission, the Penn ADRC will bring together eight cores (Administrative; Biomarker; Clinical;
Data Management and Statistical; Genomics; Neuroimaging; Neuropathology; Outreach, Recruitment, and
Engagement) and the Research Education Component (REC). These highly integrated cores will support
development of a phenotypically, pathologically, and ethno-racially diverse cohort which will be deeply
characterized through cognitive assessments, measures of social determinants of health, genetics, biofluid and
neuroimaging biomarkers, and autopsy. All these data will be stored within the Integrated Neurodegenerative
Disease Database (INDD), which is linked to the other neurodegenerative centers at Penn and will contribute
to our understanding of the upstream factors and processes that lead to AD heterogeneity and its downstream
manifestations. Further, the ADRC supports robust sharing of these data and participation in larger NIA and
national programs. The REC leverages these cores and their research programs for training new investigators.
Together, the Penn ADRC will advance our ultimate mission to reduce the tremendous burden of AD."

The mission of the UC Davis Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (UCD ADRC) is to promote a highly
innovative and enriched research environment focused on understanding the heterogeneity of brain aging
among diverse populations that will ultimately lead to effective therapies to prevent or mitigate dementia.
This approach stems from the premise that emphasizing diversity enhances discovery and contributes to
translational science as well as reducing disparities in brain health and care. To accomplish this
mission, the UCD ADRC has developed innovative methods and a unique study design to recruit and retain a
highly demographically diverse clinical and autopsy cohort. All UCD ADRC participants are longitudinally
followed and deeply phenotyped with extensive clinical, blood and imaging biomarker measures as well as
developing state-of-the-art quantitative neuropathology. The UCD ADRC succeeds at these efforts through a
robust research infrastructure, state-of-the-art database management and a highly collaborative environment
consisting of seven well integrated resource cores and one research education component (REC) designed to
facilitate new research efforts and interventions, dissemination of research findings, education and training as
well as encouraging researcher development. Our approach addresses several milestones set by the National
Alzheimer’s Project Act to effectively treat Alzheimer’s disease and associated disorders (ADRD) by 2025.
These include, but are not limited to: 1) M1.L., evaluating disparities among ethnic and racial minority
populations that are at higher risk for AD to mitigate risk and improve cognitive outcomes, 2) M2.H., fully
characterizing mixed pathologies and identifying unique risk factors,3) M5-7., accelerating the development of
treatments that would prevent, halt, or reverse the course of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), 4) M9., improving early
diagnosis through discovery of novel imaging and blood biomarkers, 5) M8., developing novel dementia
prevention strategies, and 6) M13.E.,supporting caregiving through funded caregiver research. The UCD
ADRC also directly supports multiple epidemiological studies of diverse communities through use of research
methods and personnel to gain further insights into dementia risk reduction, early diagnosis, and the impact of
various neuropathologies on aging and dementia.
Our efforts reflect the evolving needs of an increasingly older and more diverse US population, which is
expected to rise to nearly 14 million by midcentury. Moreover, while AD continues to be the major pathological
cause of dementia, more recent studies—including one from the UCD ADRC—find that dementia pathology is
multifactorial and highly heterogeneous, due in part to the co-occurrence of AD and vascular disease, which
varies by ethnoracial characteristics, is emphasized as part of dementia prediction and which can be modified
by treatment even in later life. The UCD ADRC is uniquely qualified to support this research focus with a
considerable impact on future ADRD diagnosis and treatment."

Regulation of biomolecular communication pathways is critical to maintaining physiological function. Unraveling
these pathways and filling in critical knowledge gaps will provide novel opportunities to understand, diagnose,
and treat human diseases. During Phase 1, the Nebraska Center for Integrated Biomolecular Communication
(CIBC) supported 15 early stage investigators (ESIs), helped recruit four new faculty members to the University
of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL), and established two research cores. CIBC’s ESIs secured $16.7 million in external
research funds and authored 82 peer-reviewed publications. Building on Phase 1, the goal of the CIBC in Phase
2 is to continue building a critical mass of biomedical investigators and supporting research infrastructure in the
area of biomolecular communication pathways at UNL that will position CIBC for a successful transition to long-
term sustainability in Phase 3. CIBC will continue to develop multidisciplinary teams to interrogate complex
disease pathways, especially by connecting researchers developing new molecular probes and analytical
techniques with those unravelling molecular mechanisms of human diseases. CIBC’s Phase 2 specific aims
are to: 1) strengthen UNL’s biomedical research infrastructure by supporting the research efforts and career
development of biomedical investigators whose research is broadly focused on understanding the regulation of
biomedically relevant communication pathways; 2) enhance research capabilities by maintaining and expanding
the Systems Biology Core (SBC) to facilitate acquisition of essential bioanalytical data and the Data and Life
Sciences Core (DLSC) to provide critical bioinformatics support and data management, storage, and sharing to
Center members; and 3) advance interdisciplinary research collaborations with broad disciplinary representation
to pursue high-impact research into complex disease from diverse perspectives. The initial Phase 2 Project
Leaders will pursue projects interrelated by their fundamental focus on different aspects of the biomolecular
basis of disease-associated communication pathways. These projects, which signify CIBC’s interdisciplinary
nature, are directed toward: 1) developing novel chemical probes and targeted mass spectrometry approaches
to study the cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide and receptor(s), 2) understanding how the
7SK RNP regulates transcription and its implications in human diseases, 3) conducting near real-time detection
of methicillin-resistant S. aureus by developing a generalizable electrochemical peptide-based biosensing
platform, and 4) developing a novel Unnatural Amino Acid-based Chromatin Isolation Method (UChIMe) with
improved accuracy and sensitivity. CIBC will further expand SBC and DLSC to enable Nebraska’s biomedical
researchers to pursue high-impact biomedical research. CIBC’s innovation is in integrating the research activities
of chemists, biochemists, engineers, and bioinformaticians to understand how cells communicate and integrate
metabolic and regulatory pathways relevant to disease development and progression."
10907721,"ABSTRACT – OVERALL
 Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the most common inherited cancer predisposition syndrome of a
group of developmental disorders that are collectively termed “Rasopathies”. Germline NF1 mutations cause
neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a multi-system developmental disorder that is also the most common inherited
cancer predisposition syndrome. NF1 is of exceptional importance in cancer biology because it encodes a
GTPase activating protein (GAP) called neurofibromin that binds to active Ras-GTP and terminates signaling
by accelerating guanine nucleotide hydrolysis. Thus, NF1 inactivation and somatic cancer-associated RAS
mutations result in constitutively elevated Ras-GTP levels and aberrant activation of Ras-regulated kinase
effector pathways in susceptible cell lineages. A markedly increased incidence of developing specific benign
and malignant tumors is a hallmark of NF1 that results in substantial morbidity and mortality that affect
children, adolescents, and young adults (AYAs) in a range of tissues. Investigating NF1-associated tumors
represents a unique opportunity to interrogate therapeutic responses and mechanisms of intrinsic and acquired
drug resistance in cancers that are initiated by a mutation that directly enhances Ras output. Given the central
importance of aberrant Ras/GAP function in human cancer, and the emerging role of somatic NF1 mutations in
common sporadic malignancies, achieving the goals of this SPORE will broadly advance translational cancer
research and treatment. The overall goal of this Developmental and Hyperactive Ras Tumor (DHART) SPORE
is to implement effective targeted therapies for neoplasms and cancers characterized by mutations in the NF1
tumor suppressor gene (TSG) by conducting integrated, mechanistically based translational research. The
DHART SPORE deploys novel organizing principles and approaches to address the key challenge of how to
accelerate new therapies for uncommon (“orphan”) benign and malignant tumors across an organ spectrum
with a common driver mutation. The DHART SPORE is comprised of a highly integrated group of translational
scientists that are addressing central issues for implementing mechanism-based treatments for rare tumors
driven by hyperactive Ras signaling in the pediatric, adolescent, and young adult (AYA) population. Across all
three projects, state-of-the-art core facilities will inform the patient-oriented therapeutic and prevention aspects
by delineating mutations that contribute to cancer pathogenesis, and by uncovering new biomarkers of drug
response and resistance that will inform the development of “next generation” treatments. Achieving the
objectives of the proposed Projects 1-3 will not only improve the outcomes of NF1 and non-NF1 patients with
specific cancers but has the potential to inform new therapeutic approaches for the substantial proportion of
human cancers characterized by somatic NF1 and RAS mutations that have implications for enhancing the
treatment of the ~1/3rd of all cancers with somatic RAS mutations."

The incidences of liver cancer (primarily hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)) are increasing and disease outcome
is poor. Consequently, there is an urgent need for new therapies and better preventive strategies. Age is a major
risk factor for HCC. In line with the geroscience hypothesis, we hypothesize that aging drives a dysfunctional
mitochondrial, epigenetic and metabolic network that promotes and exacerbates age-associated dysregulation
of immune function and inflammation in liver. Loss of homeostasis across multiple systems is permissive for
neoplastic liver disease. We further hypothesize that dysregulated chronic interferon signaling is central to this
pathogenic network. We will dissect this network and test the consequence of chronic interferon signaling, to
understand why the incidence of liver cancer increases with age. We will also investigate approaches that target
this network for their ability to prevent and combat liver cancer. Our overall specific objectives are:
Objective 1. Investigate age-associated changes to mitochondria, chromatin, metabolism (specifically, bile acids)
and innate and adaptive immunity, their causal role in HCC and underlying mechanisms.
Objective 2. Investigate how interactions between these different systems and age-dependent dysregulation of
these interactions contributes to HCC.
Objective 3. Test the hypothesis that at least some of these age-associated alterations and consequent
predisposition to HCC are dependent on chronic interferon signaling in aged tissue.
Objective 4. Investigate approaches that target age dysregulation, for example suppressors of chronic interferon
activation, mitohormetic interventions, rapamycin, senolytics, bile acid modulators and immune-modulators, for
their ability to suppress the onset of liver cancer and better counter established cancer.
Since age is the biggest single risk factor for HCC, it follows that a molecular understanding of the age-
dependence of HCC can lead to improved disease management through risk assessment, early detection,
prognostication and therapy. Moreover, an understanding of how HCC develops during aging can also lead to
preventative interventions. This PPG will define critical molecular mechanisms underpinning age-dependence of
HCC. We will also promote approaches for improved risk assessment through application, testing and refinement
of a transcriptome-based “tumorigenic index” to quantitate the risk of HCC. Finally, based on our discoveries,
we will test a panel of candidate interventions for those that can prevent and combat HCC."

The University of Kentucky (UK) Center of Biomedical Research Excellence on Cancer and Metabolism (CCM)
was established in March 2017 by a multidisciplinary team of basic and clinical scientists engaged in cutting-
edge research on metabolic dysregulations in cancer, an emerging hallmark of disease responsible for tumor
development, drug resistance and distant metastasis. The overarching goal of the Phase II CCM is to continue
efforts to expand a thematically focused multidisciplinary infrastructure dedicated to defining the contribution of
metabolism in the development and treatment of cancer and to use this novel multidisciplinary platform to
develop promising project leaders with enhanced skills in an exciting new area of cancer research. With a
dedicated team of mentors combining basic and clinical expertise in redox biology, cancer cell signaling,
epigenetics, systems biochemistry and clinical trials, as well as core strengths in advanced metabolomics and
sophisticated cancer imaging, we will accomplish this overall goal by conducting high-quality basic and
translational research addressing metabolic reprogramming governing tumor initiation, metastasis, drug
resistance and recurrence. This objective will be met by achieving 2 Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1 is to expand
the critical mass of investigators conducting CCM thematic research. We will recruit, coach and solidify the
commitment of a cadre of promising project leaders to conduct cancer and metabolism research utilizing a highly
effective mentoring system and provide these scientists with cutting-edge research core facilities and services.
Proposed new synergies will be developed through 4 well-crafted research projects; an Administrative Core;
innovative research cores in metabolism and imaging; strong biostatistics and bioinformatics support; and
collaborations with other UK research centers to facilitate the translation of basic findings in cancer metabolism
into early therapeutic and/or intervention approaches. Specific Aim 2 is to advance an independent, sustainable,
multidisciplinary thematic biomedical infrastructure and research program on cancer and metabolism by
strengthening key scientific cores. We propose to expand the scope and capacity of these vital cores by acquiring
and installing new state-of-the-art equipment, introducing new technologies and service as well as providing
training sessions, workshops and symposiums. Kentucky ranks highest in rates of overall cancer incidence and
mortality [1]. In Phase I, the CCM had a transformative impact in career research and retention of the next
generation of scientists who address metabolic dysregulations underpinning the causal links between metabolic
disorders and cancer development, a major health threat in the nation. Importantly, the Phase II application will
build upon these accomplishments to propel CCM to a nationally recognized center in cancer and metabolism
research that will also address the region’s critical needs."

The goals of this P30 Vision Core Renewal Application are to manage and maintain existing and new core
facilities that will provide expertise, technical support, equipment access, and personnel training for 24
independent vision research laboratories at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. We have had
two highly utilized and successful cores: Live Animal Imaging and Functional Analysis Core (AAC) (which has
been merged with the previous Genotyping Core), and a Cellular Imaging and Morphometric Analysis Core
(CIC). In this competing renewal, we have added a new Ocular Immunobiology Core (OIC) to provide new
equipment, training, and expertise for our rapidly growing interests in the immunological underpinnings of
ocular diseases. The AAC (two independent modules) is conveniently located inside of the two major vivaria
that house most of the vision research animals on campus, while the CIC and OIC are located in the
Department of Ophthalmology. Each core is directed by an NEI-funded investigator and supervised by highly
qualified and well-trained Systems Managers, Analysts, and Specialists who assist and train vision researchers
in the use of state-of-the-art resources. The availability of multiple types of advanced equipment, sophisticated
software, and hands-on training has dramatically increased the quality and quantity of research achievements
by the users of our Vision Core facilities. The P30 Vision Cores have: 1) increased opportunities for rigorous
translational research using clinically relevant and non-invasive imaging modalities, 2) generated collaborative
projects that require multiple areas of expertise, 3) increased and enhanced productivity of existing research
projects, thereby allowing participating investigators to remain competitive for funding, 4) promoted recruitment
of new faculty from other campuses, and 5) supported the development of new research strategies based on
the acquisition of data from the use of equipment otherwise unavailable to the PIs. Moving forward, the three
P30 Vision Cores will continue to provide a high level of expertise, instrumentation, and service, further
elevating our contributions to the forefront of vision science research."

Building on a biomedical and clinical research infrastructure developed through COBRE Phase 1 funding, and
the successful recruitment of several promising early career investigators, the DE SCD COBRE is submitting a
competitive renewal application to continue capacity-building and innovative research. In Phase 1, the DE SCD
COBRE contributed to more than $13 million in new funding in Delaware. Integration of the DE SCD COBRE

early career investigators, as well as pilot funding. In this Phase 2 COBRE submission, the DE SCD COBRE
presents a new mentoring model, a new pilot funding program, a new Clinical Research and Data Informatics
Core and four new target investigators. Each of these new additions builds on success in Phase 1 and is
responsive to areas of strength and growth. Additionally, we developing a multidisciplinary and systematic
approach to study the influence of stigma and racism within communities and the healthcare system on the
efficacy of both routine health maintenance and targeted interventions in patients with SCD. We will evaluate
biomarkers for severe SCD co-morbidities (Project 4), engage our patients and community to take stock of
barriers to routine care (Project 1, 2, and 3) and explore tools to improve self-efficacy among health care
providers (Project 1) and patients (Project 1, 2, and 3), while simultaneously confronting how racism impacts
the health of children and young adults (Project 1, 2, and 3). Central to all aspects of the Delaware Sickle Cell
Research Program is the overarching Center hypothesis that effective management of a common,
congenital, multi-system disease requires comprehensive investigations spanning the biological, medical,
psychological, and societal factors that impact both the severity of the disease and the efficacy of interventions."

A key limitation to effective immunotherapy is the physical access of immune cells to the cancer cells. We
propose to develop a multiscale tumor simulator to predict tumor dynamics based on immune and cancer
cell migration and net proliferation as measured quantitatively from live cell microscopy. The tumor
simulator will be developed by biomedical engineers working in close collaboration with immunologists and
genetic engineers who are developing immunotherapies for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and
glioblastoma. The tumor simulator will be a computational platform that will help guide immunotherapy
development and so will evolve to become an immunotherapy simulator. In addition, we will integrate state-
of-the-art genome engineering and microenvironmental engineering to bring a full suite of engineering
approaches to bear on the simulator development. Together, the simulator will be used to make
quantitative, testable predictions that are then tested experimentally using pharmacological and genetic
perturbations. By iterative model development we will test our central hypothesis that immune cell proximity
is a major determinant of effective anti-tumoral immune response, and limiting to effective immunotherapy
of solid tumors. Altogether, our Program Project will develop a comprehensive biophysics-based simulator
to predict tumor progression and accelerate immunotherapy development."

This proposal is a competitive renewal for a unique study that measures the volume, function, and
development of striatal-cerebellar circuity in children at risk for Huntington's Disease (HD). The standard
assumption is that HD is a degenerative disease of the striatum. However, research supports supported the
notion that a crucial component of the pathoetiology of HD is abnormal brain development. The grant was
originally funded in 2009 and dubbed the Kids-HD program, designed to investigate this hypothesis by the
study of children at risk for HD (those with a parent or grandparent with HD). The at-risk participants are
genotyped and those who are gene-expanded (GE) are compared to those who are gene non-expanded
(GNE).
Gene knock-down therapy – Antisense Oligonucleotides or ASOs – are currently entering Phase III studies and
hold promise for treatment of patients in early stages of disease (by preventing further decline). If ASOs fulfill
that promise, the next step will be preventive therapy – giving the ASO early enough (potentially to children) to
prevent symptoms from occurring. The growth and development of the striatum is vital to understand as this is
the primary site of disease pathology. Yet, knocking down a gene that is vital to development of these
structures must be approached with an abundance of caution. Human brain development is prolonged, with
striatal maturational changes occurring up through 30 years of age. Therefore, discriminating ongoing
development/maturation with the degenerative phase of the disease may be key in knowing when to administer
and ASO. Our preliminary data suggest that a novel blood biomarker – Neurofilament light (NfL) rises within
roughly 20 years of onset but is normal prior to that, suggesting it is not present in development, but is seen at
the very beginning phases of degeneration.
Rationale for renewal and expansion (5 sites across the US) include: 1) increase sample size for replication of
original findings with sufficient power to detect CAG-specific effects and 2) model the entire period of brain
development (up to age 30 rather than only up to age 18); 3) evaluate the utility of a blood biomarker of neural
dysfunction, Neurofilament light (NFl) that may help delineate the earliest phases of degeneration."

Neutrophils constitute the first line of cellular defense against pathogenic microorganisms. In response to pro-
inflammatory cues, unrestricted neutrophil activation induces tissue damage. To avoid deleterious effects to the
host, neutrophil numbers, activation, and lifespan must be tightly regulated, but the molecular mechanisms that
control neutrophils in the context of inflammatory disease remain elusive. Cardiovascular disease is the leading
global cause of death. Recent evidence supports an important role for neutrophils in the development of coronary
artery disease (CAD). Neutrophils are present in early aortic lesions and in rupture-prone atherosclerotic
plaques, and a positive correlation between plasma levels of neutrophil secretory proteins and CAD has been
established, suggesting that neutrophil exocytosis mediates detrimental effects in CAD. Furthermore, neutrophil
production is increased in the bone marrow in atherosclerotic models and newly identified neutrophil precursors
are now known to mediate inflammation. How neutrophil subsets contribute to disease progression in CAD has
not been studied and the regulation of neutrophil diversity in disease is unknown. The inflammasome is an
emerging driver in atherosclerosis; however, the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome activation selectively in
neutrophils on atherogenesis has not been studied and the mechanisms regulating the functions of neutrophil
lineage cells in the context of inflammasome activation and atherogenesis remain unknown. In this synergistic
program, Project 1 Neutrophil Development During Inflammation and Atherosclerosis will study how neutrophil
heterogeneity is modulated in human subjects with CAD, and how the NLRP3 inflammasome in neutrophil
progenitors influences granulopoiesis and neutrophil heterogeneity in atherosclerosis. Project 2 Neutrophil
Mechanisms During Inflammation and Atherosclerosis will test the hypothesis that hyperlipidemia differentially
regulates vesicular trafficking and associated functions of neutrophil precursors in CAD, establish mechanisms
of NLRP3-induced neutrophil exocytosis dysregulation and implement translational approaches to decrease
neutrophil inflammation in CAD. Project 3 Neutrophil Survival and Demise During Inflammatory States will
characterize the expression and function of components of the NLRP3 inflammasome in cells of the neutrophil
lineage, and will define the effects of hyperlipidemia-induced inflammation and the roles of death receptor
signaling in IL-1β production, mitochondrial apoptosis in viability of neutrophil lineage cells, and necroptosis
signaling in atherogenesis. Our synergistic and unique program uses the complementary expertise of three
renown researchers, experts in the areas of neutrophil development, neutrophil intracellular function regulation
and inflammation, to study the central hypothesis that unrestricted activation of neutrophil progenitors and mature
neutrophils is a fundamental process in cardiovascular disease. These studies will lead to novel approaches to
treat neutrophil-mediated inflammation in CAD."

Mesenchymal cells are major components of tissue stroma and best known for their role in supporting the
physical structure of organs. They juxtapose to and communicate with epithelial cells, to control organ
development in embryos, and to regulate tissue inflammation, injury repair and cancer progression in adults.
Traditionally, mesenchymal cells in different organs were thought to perform similar functions. However, recent
studies have revealed unexpected diversity of gene expression signatures among mesenchymal cells from
different organs. Such diversity is likely to play a crucial role in regulating mesenchymal-epithelial interactions
and thus organ development and physiology. The overarching goal of this proposal is to understand how
epithelial-mesenchymal interactions control organogenesis across different organs. To achieve this goal, we will
first address the question of how mesenchymal diversity arises as the consequence of distinct signaling histories.
We will develop a novel high-throughput system to simultaneously test tens of thousands of signal combinations.
We will then investigate how epithelial-mesenchymal interactions control tissue morphogenesis, by reconstituting
and genetically perturbing such interactions ex vivo. We are especially interested in comparing the specificity
and plasticity of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions across different organs, and identifying the role of
extracellular matrices that are shared by epithelial and mesenchymal cells in controlling morphogenesis. We will
closely integrate experimental measurements with computational models to produce a quantitative framework
for understanding organ morphogenesis. By integrating tools and materials from diverse fields, we will gain a
fundamental understanding about the developmental origin and functional implications of the long-overlooked
mesenchymal cells. These insights and tools will enable the engineering of organoids to better model
development and diseases, and will advance the field of tissue engineering."
11014626,"Project Summary
 A staggering number of potential targets for combating diseases fall into a category called undruggable,
targets that are not accessible to two commonly used drug modalites: antibodies and small molecules. These
undruggable targets often reside inside the cells and cannot be accessed by antibodies, which are too large to
cross the cell membrane. Their flat surfaces deviate from the common deep pockets that are often hit by small
molecules. To untap the potential of these targets, we need a therapeutic modality that can target shallow
pockets and cross the cell membrane. Peptides are at the size range and composition that can be an ideal
choice as this alternative modality.
 Despite efforts in developing high affinity peptide binders, generating permeable binders has been a
long-standing challenge. The few examples of cell permeable functional peptides are often developed through
error and trial or via many rounds of modification and testing. The challenge in obtaining permeable binders is
mainly due to lack of high throughput methods to screen for permeability, which has not only limited the power
of library-based screening for obtaining permeable binders, but has also resulted in a limited amount of
experimental data from which one can deduce rules that govern a peptide permeable. Thus, the use of
peptides as therapeutics to drug the undruggable has remained largely underdeveloped.
 This proposal uses an interdisciplinary approach to address this challenge. We generate a network to
represent the peptide space in a meaningful manner. We then cluster this network and select for experimental
testing a set that is truly representative of the peptide space. The results of our tests, which include both
artificial membrane analysis and cellular uptake in bacterial and mammalian cells, can thus be generalized to
the entire space. This unprecedented dataset will then be used as a starting point to gain better understanding
of peptide permeability and to develop experimental and computational methods for rapid identification of
permeable peptide binders that can be used as leads for therapeutic development. We will use this dataset to
develop an automated generative algorithm that computationally designs permeable peptides that can target a
target interface of interest.
 This proposal is a leap in the field of peptide therapeutic development. The dataset generated during this
work and methods we develop will be the stepping stone for many researchers interested in drug discovery,
physics-based models of permeability, and peptide therapeutics."

DNA repair maintains genome stability to prevent cancer and provides resistance to cancer treatments; yet, DNA
repair defects lead to cancer-causing mutations and are an Achilles heel for cancer-targeted treatments.
Structural Cell Biology of DNA Repair Machines 5 (SBDR-5) coordinates leaders in DNA repair (DR) to work
together synergistically for comprehensive mechanistic and structural knowledge of DR processes. Four
interacting Projects (P1-4) target DR pathways implicated in cancer etiology, treatment, and resistance:
P1 investigates repair of base lesions from chemotherapy including a paradigm-shifting model for RNA damage
responses to alkylating agents.
P2 defines inter-locking pathways for repair of dsDNA breaks (DSBs), a result of radiation therapy as well as
replication encounters with DNA lesions.
P3 examines PARylation-mediated phase condensates and their impacts on DR for PARP inhibitor therapies.
P4 determines mechanisms in replication fork stress responses, key consequences of many cancer treatments.
Our highest priorities are to solve actionable structures in each Project and apply our teamwork to biochemically
and biologically test molecular insights and hypotheses based on our structures. Two experimental Cores will
enable efficient preparation of DR assemblies and determination of their structures. Removing bottlenecks within
individual laboratories and promoting collaborative efforts, SBDR Projects and Cores together enable a
comprehensive cross-pathway knowledge of dynamic multi-functional DR machines – knowledge best achieved
through multi-disciplinary approaches and concerted efforts by multiple groups. Our four Program aims are:
1) Determine actionable and biologically-validated structures of DR complexes, interfaces, and conformations.
2) Dissect multi-functionality of DR machineries tested by structure-based design of separation-of-function
mutations and chemical inhibitors to inform on predicted therapeutic sensitivity and development of resistance.
3) Define DR pathway interactions and crosstalk with replication dynamics to delineate DR pathway outcomes.
4) Discover synthetic lethality from mutations or chemical agents that target specific DR activities and which
become essential only in conjunction with another DR defect to promote successful therapeutic interventions.
SBDR will provide lasting structure-based knowledge for interpretation of mutations from The Cancer Genome
Atlas and of mechanisms that inform system level knockout and knockdown correlations. Through concerted
efforts, SBDR-5 will establish biologically-validated structures and synthetic lethality relationships with durable
biological and medical utility. We will share constructs, mutants, inhibitors, data, and technologies to enhance
synergy, reproducibility, and efficiency. Our target structures and mechanisms are both challenging and timely:
the expected results will have indelible impacts on ongoing NIH research in other labs, on assessment of cancer
genome data, and on knowledge for treatment strategies in ongoing clinical and preclinical trials of DR inhibitors."
10845563,"Hurdles for controlling tuberculosis (TB) include developing a highly efficacious vaccine, preventing
transmission and infection in endemic areas, and discovering drug treatment regimens that work rapidly and
kill dormant bacilli within macrophages. After exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), outcomes vary
widely including resistance, asymptomatic latent infection, active pulmonary disease, and disseminated
infections including TB meningitis (TBM). This heterogeneity complicates clinical treatment decisions with
regards to choosing the number of drugs and duration of treatment. This broad clinical spectrum also presents
a unique opportunity for understanding the biological mechanisms that control TB pathogenesis. A major
source of heterogeneity is a combination of genetic variation in both humans and Mtb that are evolving under
constant selective pressure. Our overall program objective is to use genetic, genomic, proteomic, and
bioinformatic strategies to discover host and pathogen variants of genes and gene products that are
associated with TB clinical outcomes and to determine how these variants interact to regulate molecular,
cellular, and in vivo functions. Our strategy is anchored upon two powerful cohorts in Vietnam and Uganda
(Core A) that capture the full spectrum of resistance to traditional LTBI (latent TB infection), LTBI, pulmonary
TB disease, and disseminated disease in the form of TBM. Core A examines paired host and Mtb genetic
data and the association with these diverse clinical outcomes. In Project 1, we use genetic and new
proteomic strategies to examine how the Mtb genes and variants identified by Core A function and how the
encoded proteins interact with and regulate macrophage responses. In Project 2, we use human genetic
methods along with proteomic strategies in macrophages to uncover regulatory host genes and variants that
are associated with resistance to Mtb infection and/or disseminated TB. In Project 3, we examine in vivo
mechanisms of transmission and dissemination that are attributed to specific host genes and pathways and
Mtb variants, employing a new and powerful mouse model of infection that recapitulates many of the
manifestations that occur in human TB. Core B uses pathway-driven and novel bioinformatics approaches to
integrate the genetic results from Core A with the multiple large-scale and diverse datasets to dynamically
identify and prioritize pathways and protein networks for functional testing. Together, this multidisciplinary
program and strategy will enable us to test our overall hypothesis that variants of Mtb and host genes dictate
heterogeneous clinical outcomes and encode factors that interact with and alter innate immune cells. We will
use genetic, genomic, proteomic, and bioinformatic strategies to examine variation in Mtb and its paired
human host to examine mechanisms of resistance and susceptibility to infection and disease with discovery of
biomarkers for clinical management and novel immunomodulatory therapies."
11176614,"Project Summary/Abstract:
The annotation of the mammalian protein coding genome is alarmingly incomplete. Despite the massive
acceleration and widespread use of transcriptomic approaches to understand biological processes, we still do
not fundamentally understand RNA translation at its most basic level. Traditional definitions that categorize an
RNA as either protein coding or non-coding, are currently incompatible with recent findings from genome wide
translatome studies. We hypothesize that a combination of technological barriers and an adherence to dogmatic
assumptions of what constitutes an open reading frame (ORF) and protein coding RNA, have severely
constrained identification of a plethora of novel regulators of biological processes. We term this uncharacterized
material genomic dark matter. In this proposal, we aim to systematically identify and functionally uncover its true
contribution to the inflammatory response. By utilizing ribosome profiling in steady state and activated
macrophages, we have identified “non-coding” RNA undergoing robust translation. Furthermore, we uncovered
widespread polycistronic translation of multiple ORFs within classically annotated protein coding genes. To
reveal the functional contribution of these alternative ORFs and delineate their role from that of their gene’s
annotated ORF, we propose to conduct a parallel loss and gain of function inverse screening approach to identify
novel proteins that contribute to the inflammatory response. Furthermore, although protein coding genes are
thought to solely function by providing a message for protein synthesis, we have identified a class of mRNAs
that are highly differentially expressed following bacterial stimulation but are not translated. This philosophically
questions the very classification of a protein coding gene. By combining transcriptional silencing and ORF
disruption studies, we aim to decouple the functional contribution of a gene’s RNA from its coding potential. In
addition, although current ribosome profiling technologies are ill suited to discover unannotated transcripts
undergoing translation, we have identified a plethora of mRNA derived from atypical “trans-splicing” between
two different transcripts that appear to encode novel chimeric proteins. By developing an innovative technological
pipeline, RiboFusionSeq, we will generate the first rigorous identification platform for coding chimeric RNAs.
Furthermore, to uncover the capacity of intra-transcript circularization via “back-splicing” to encode novel protein,
RiboCircSeq will be established. Using knockdown approaches specifically targeting trans- and back-splicing
events, we will conduct the first functional screening of proteins derived from atypical splicing and interrogate
their contribution to immunity. Finally, we will generate animal models to test the mechanistic and physiological
importance of our findings in inflammation and disease. Together, these studies will 1) provide a transformative
level of resolution on the protein coding genome during the immune response, 2) establish a new paradigm for
the functional annotation of mammalian genomes, 3) identify a plethora of new molecules for further investigation
and 4) have far reaching implications to understanding the processes underlying all human diseases."
11009682,"ABSTRACT
People with disabling motor disorders rely on assistive devices and caregivers for many of their most basic
needs. Current assistive devices are inherently limited, as they rely on (and encumber) residual motor function
as a command interface. Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) provide a pathway to more powerful assistive options
by directly monitoring brain activity and using it to decipher movement intention in real-time. However, BMIs have
yet to achieve performance and robustness that would warrant widespread clinical adoption. A key obstacle is
that nearly all BMIs to date use direct decoding, i.e., they attempt to map the activity of brain areas like motor
cortex (MC) directly onto external movement parameters such as velocity. This has resulted in BMIs that are
brittle: they often fail in new contexts, and are highly sensitive to neural interface instabilities. Instead, I envision
a radically different approach with the potential to impact virtually every existing BMI application. The central
element is dynamical systems decoding (DSD), a framework I developed that fuses advances in motor
neuroscience with cutting-edge AI methods to achieve unprecedented decoding accuracy. DSD uses neural
networks to precisely reveal MC's complex internal activity patterns, known as dynamics, on a moment-by-
moment basis. This enables a clean separation between activity related to internal dynamics and activity related
to external movement parameters. In offline analyses, I showed that DSD enables a breakthrough in decoding,
predicting movements on millisecond timescales with substantially higher accuracy than the current state-of-the-
art. A key focus of this proposal is developing universal, subject-independent BMIs that harness the remarkable
similarities in MC dynamics observed across subjects. Using new AI methods to model more than a decade of
previously-collected monkey data, we will test whether subject-independent models can enable BMIs that work
nearly `out of the box', with performance that could only be achieved through massive datasets, while still
avoiding burdensome, subject-specific calibration. In parallel with offline studies, we will work directly with people
who are paralyzed to develop online BMIs with unparalleled performance and robustness. Performance
improvements will be achieved through hybrid decoding paradigms that capitalize on high-level movement
information that is uniquely uncovered via DSD. While BMI robustness is typically limited in direct decoding –
due to gradual changes in the specific neurons being monitored – DSD will enable robust BMIs by leveraging
MC dynamics, which are stable for years and independent of whichever specific neurons are being monitored at
a given time. These two innovations would enable BMIs that achieve unprecedented performance and on-
demand, 24/7 reliability for years. If successful, these studies will pave the way to dramatically improving the
performance, robustness, and clinical utility of nearly every BMI application."

Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is reduced in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients and mouse models by ~20%, but
there remains a limited understanding of the mechanisms causing this hypoperfusion or the potential therapeutic
benefit of rescuing CBF deficits. Under the previous award, chronic in vivo two-photon excited fluorescence
microscopy was used to study CBF in mouse models of AD. While no blood flow disruption in cortical arterioles
or venules was observed, blood flow was found to be stalled in ~2% of cortical capillaries in mouse models of
AD, as compared to ~0.4% in wild type controls. These capillary stalls appeared early in disease progression,
were caused by arrested neutrophils, and had outsized impacts on CBF because they decreased flow speed in
up- and down-stream vessels. Antibodies against the neutrophil surface protein Ly6G were serendipitously found
to reduce the incidence of capillary stalls immediately, leading to a rescue of two-thirds of the CBF deficit, and,
remarkably, to improved memory function within hours. Preliminary data further link this capillary stalling to
cellular damage from reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this competitive renewal, the mechanisms underlying
neutrophil arrest in capillaries in mouse models of AD and the consequences of improving CBF on AD-related
pathology are explored. First, three different hypotheses about the mechanism of neutrophil arrest in capillary
segments are tested: a focal constriction of the capillary by a pericyte that prevents neutrophil passage; binding
of the neutrophil to increased inflammatory adhesion molecules on endothelial cells; or binding of the neutrophil
to basement membrane and adhesion molecules exposed at widened gaps between endothelial cells. Second,
the molecular and cellular origin of the ROS that leads to neutrophil arrest is determined using cell type-specific
knockouts of ROS producing enzymes. Third, the impact of long-term CBF rescue on the deposition of amyloid-
beta (Aβ), a driver of AD pathology, and on neuropathology will be quantified. Critical for this study are recently-
developed knock-in mouse models of AD that may better capture the feedback of CBF reductions on expression
of amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is cleaved to produce Aβ. Finally, cutting-edge three-photon excited
fluorescence microscopy is used to enable imaging of the hippocampus to determine the role of capillary stalling
in CBF deficits in one of the first regions of the brain that exhibits AD pathology. The hypothesis that brain
hypoperfusion in AD is due to neutrophil arrest in capillaries is both novel and strongly supported by the findings
under the previous award. The work proposed in this competitive renewal would uncover the mechanisms
underlying that neutrophil arrest, which could suggest therapeutic targets to improve CBF that would be
complementary to anti-amyloid and other treatment approaches for AD."
11062710,"Allergy is a major world health challenge affecting 25% of people with a rising incidence. Peanut allergy
alone affects 2.2% of school children in the US and can be life-threatening. Allergy is a complex disease, with
both genetic and environmental factors contributing to risk. In order to pinpoint the underlying genetic risk
variants, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been performed on hundreds of thousands of
patients and controls, identifying >100 associated loci. The vast majority of hits are in poorly annotated
noncoding regions of the genome and are thought to influence gene regulation. A major challenge for
understanding allergy (and all complex diseases) is pinpointing the causal variant(s) and defining molecular
mechanisms. The extensive follow up work required is often not undertaken and thus allergy GWAS rarely
contribute to our understanding of disease etiology. In order to mine the rich resource of human disease
associations, new methods are needed to systematically annotate regulatory effects. Existing catalogs are
sparse and biased toward specific cell types (blood), contexts (steady state conditions), molecular
mechanisms (perturbation of gene expression), and populations (Caucasians). Given the highly cell type and
context specific nature of gene regulation, this limited window is unlikely to be sufficient for identifying
most human risk variants. The most comprehensive effort to date to map regulatory effects is the Genotype-
Tissue Expression Project (GTEx), which mapped loci that influence gene expression (eQTLs) in 54 tissues
using autopsy specimens from hundreds of healthy individuals. Despite its scope, the GTEx catalog thus far
explains only 11% of the genetic risk of complex disease, suggesting additional assays and specimens are
needed to unearth the majority of regulatory effects contributing to disease. In this application I propose an
innovative approach to systematically catalog the gene regulatory effects of genetic variants on a massive
scale across diverse allergy-relevant cell types and patient specimens. Crucially, this scalable approach can
accommodate cell stimulation conditions (e.g., allergen challenge), inclusion of diverse human ancestry
groups, and is deployable on scant human tissue and blood specimens. By leveraging a single cell
framework, we are able to probe rare cell populations that play essential roles as mediators of disease. I will
apply this method to allergy relevant GTEx tissues as well as a large-scale allergy biobank representing
heterogenous cases. This study is expected to provide a greatly expanded window into the biology of genetic
loci linked to allergy and elucidate the potential of multi-omic single cell approaches, pathophysiological
stimuli, and patient biospecimens to unearth missing complex disease heritability."

This project will expand my recent inventions in directed evolution to create tools for cell-type specific
photoswitchable tuning of G-protein coupled receptors. The human genome encodes >900 G-protein
coupled receptors (GPCRs). Found in every cell, GPCRs contribute to every known biological process;
from our sense of taste, smell, and sight to coordinating hormone, neurotransmitter, and immune
functions. The past one-hundred years of biochemical research on this protein family has produced
346 structural determinations, >100,000 confirmed ligands, and a wealth of signaling assay
platforms. Absent from this impressive roster are any tools for the discrete, cell-type specific tuning
of endogenous receptor activity (Fig 1). Without such tools, we lack the ability to directly connect
discrete GPCR signaling events to cell-type specific physiological outputs. Such tools are essential if
we are to understand how GPCRs dictate human health and disease. In this NIH New Innovator
proposal, I will expand my recently invented platform for mammalian directed evolution to create a
production pipeline for cell-type specific, photoswitchable allosteric modulators of GPCRs. I will then
develop the first of these modulators for the D1 and D2 dopamine GPCRs and use these tools to refine
existing models of dopaminergic reward signaling in the murine brain. The success of this proposal
will benefit every field of biomedical research, creating a pipeline to gain tunable control of not only
any GPCR, but any cell signaling protein."

region of the United States, by providing an environment and core resources that catalyze innovative research,
outreach, education, and clinical programs. Our signature resources include: 1) a cognitively normal group of
~500 subjects followed longitudinally, together with ~300 additional subjects who transitioned to MCI or
dementia, and all committed to brain autopsy upon death; 2) a strong autopsy program with clinical-
neuropathological correlations and short postmortem interval research material; 3) a maturing program
studying the early preclinical biological emergence of mixed pathologies and how they contribute to late life
dementia states, with an increasing focus on antemortem biomarker collection; 4) an integrated centralized

because the head and neck organs support critical functions such as breathing, nourishing and communicating,
and thus HNC can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. The CO HNC SPORE takes advantage of our
expertise in basic and clinical sciences, and uses unique model systems to identify novel molecular and cellular
mechanisms of HNC pathogenesis targetable by therapeutic interventions to treat all cancer types arising from
head and neck anatomic sites. Three projects cover the treatment spectrum of head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC) and include both tobacco-related and human papillomavirus (HPV)-related HNSCC.
Project 1 studies novel immunotherapy mechanisms by inhibiting EphB4-EFNB2 interactions between immune
cells and the endothelium. It will test if blockade of EphB4-EFNB2 signaling at the tumor endothelial barrier
hinders Tregs' and TAMs' ability to infiltrate and promote cancer survival or suppress Teff function. The
applicability of pre-clinical data to clinic will be assessed in samples from HNSCC patients treated with an EphB4-
EFNB2 inhibitor during a window trial. Project 2 investigates if dual inhibition of TGFβ/PD-L1 combined with
radiation therapy (RT) induces in situ vaccination, reverses immune suppression, and overcomes RT resistance.
It will translate its findings with a trial of the TGFβ/PD-L1 dual inhibitor M7824 combined with RT in locally
recurrent and oligometastatic HNSCC patients. Project 3 will study mechanisms of protein elongation inhibition
in HNSCC, identifying key proteins targeted by the novel inhibitor SVC112 (a drug discovered in Colorado that
is nearing clinical testing), and translating our findings by testing the distribution and prognostic significance of
its target (eEF2) in patient samples. It will use immune relevant models including syngeneic and humanized mice
to study immune-dependent and –independent mechanisms of SVC112 and study if protein elongation inhibition
impacts the tumor microenvironment and enhances RT in HNSCC. The developmental research program (DRP)
is designed to attract current HNC researchers and researchers from other fields to conduct innovative research
in all types of cancers arising from head and neck tissues. The career enhancement program (CEP) is designed
to solicit junior researchers to develop research projects to transition into independent HNC researchers. We
encourage underrepresented minority (URM) and people with disabilities to apply for DRP and CEP projects.
The CO HNC SPORE also includes Biospecimen/Pathology, Data Science, and Administrative Cores. In

Cellular RNAs have more than 100 different kinds of chemical modifications, which together comprise the
epitranscriptome. Previous studies have revealed that RNA-modifying pathways are vital to higher eukaryotes,
and the alteration of these pathways is associated with a number of human diseases. However, it is still unclear
why we need such a complex chemical repertoire for RNA and how RNA modifications impact gene expression
in biological tissues with diverse cell types. The major bottleneck for investigating RNA modifications has been
the lack of measurement tools with subcellular and single-cell resolutions. Bulk epitranscriptomic sequencing
methods can only measure the averaged distribution of modification sites from millions of cells, obscuring the
intrinsic heterogeneity of epitranscriptomic states in distinct cell types. Moreover, spatial information is lost during
RNA extraction from tissues, preventing further analysis of RNA modification patterns in the context of tissue
morphology and subcellular compartments. To address such limitations, we propose to create cutting-edge
platforms for three-dimensional (3D) in situ sequencing of RNA modifications. Then we will utilize the new tools
to analyze gene regulation mechanisms mediated by RNA modifications at single-cell resolution in intact
biological tissues. Using the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) pathway in mouse brain tissue as our model system, we
will (a) develop innovative and broadly applicable 3D in situ sequencing methods for RNA modifications; (b)
profile the m6A code at single-cell resolution within intact mouse brain tissue; (c) study how m6A modifications in
various cell types work collectively and interactively to regulate brain function. In total, this proposal will lead to
(1) a transformative toolbox for single-cell epitranscriptomic profiling with broad applications in various biological
tissues, (2) a spatially resolved single-cell RNA modification atlas in the mouse brain, and (3) new scientific
understanding on how RNA modifications impact tissue function. In the long term, we aim to reveal new principles
of post-transcriptional gene regulation at subcellular and single-cell resolutions in complex biological systems,
as well as discover new chemical fingerprints of RNAs in health and disease."

Before it kills, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) exacts a devastating toll on patients, families, caregivers, and

new Duke/University of North Carolina ADRC is poised to transform AD-related research and services across
the Research Triangle and Eastern North Carolina. The new Duke/University of North Carolina Alzheimer’s
Disease Research Center (Duke/UNC ADRC)’s theme is identifying age-related changes across the lifespan
that mediate development, progression, and experience of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In support of this theme,
the Duke/UNC ADRC clinical cohort design and biomarker collection equips investigators with data and
resources to discover new opportunities to intervene in the years before AD symptoms manifest. A related
Center goal is to identify how factors that arise in early and mid-life contribute to racial and urban/rural
disparities in dementia. The Center plans to provide infrastructure and resources aligned with the following
specific aims: 1) Stimulate and support research on AD and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias
(AD+ADRD) for investigators from many fields by providing access to well-characterized subjects, curated data
and biospecimens from diverse individuals across a wide age-spectrum with and without dementia, with
emphasis on pre-clinical and early disease; 2) Attract and prepare diverse, creative, well-trained investigators
to conduct high caliber research on AD+ADRD and 3) Improve lives impacted by age-related cognitive decline
and increase the inclusiveness of this research. The Center’s Cores (Clinical, Biomarker, Neuropathology,

dementia outreach across North Carolina, strong existing ties to minority and rural communities, and
institutional resources and experts in disparities research. The Center’s Clinical, Biomarker, and
Neuropathology Cores, in conjunction with the ORE Core will support collection of images, biospecimens, and
fluids from over 500 well-characterized participants across a broad age range. The DMS Core will support data
curation and analysis by providing integrated data management and statistical/bioinformatics collaborative
expertise. The REC will develop a robust and diverse pipeline of future leaders in AD+ADRD research through
an innovative combination of widely disseminated curricular elements and more personalized mentoring
experiences. The REC’s educational platforms extend to three additional Universities in our catchment area,
including two majority minority institutions. The ADRC’s Cores and the REC, supported by the Administrative
Core, will work in a coordinated manner to generate and store data and resources from people with and
without dementia or AD risk, share data and expertise as widely as possible, and ultimately contribute back to
the AD community through dissemination of results, education, and health services."

The development of new chemotherapeutic approaches for the treatment of infectious disease is, by
acclamation, one of the preeminent challenges of modern biomedical science. Contributing causes include the
emergence of organisms resistant to existing therapies, the reemergence of infectious agents once thought
vanquished, and the spread of infectious diseases lacking effective treatments. Confronting these public health
challenges requires coordinated and comprehensive efforts from nearly every relevant area of biomedical
science from microbiology to pharmacology to medicinal chemistry. This Phase II proposal is designed to
strengthen and enhance the investments and infrastructure established in Phase I for the Center for Chemical
Biology of Infectious Diseases (CBID). This will be accomplished through thorough selection and successful
mentoring of Research Project investigators, enabling research opportunities and access to core resources
through Pilot Project support, recruitment of outstanding new faculty scientists, and substantially increasing the
user base of Research Core facilities with a focus on long-term sustainability. Together, the CBID Center will
continue to address critical gaps and enable researchers at the University of Kansas (KU) and associated
institutions to apply these tools to better understand and potentially prevent infectious diseases."

10926930,"ABSTRACT – Overall
 Widespread HPV vaccination in the US could prevent 32,100 cancers every year. Despite this tremendous
potential, HPV vaccination coverage is far short of the nation's goal of 80%. Provider recommendations are
uniquely powerful in increasing HPV vaccine uptake. However, primary care teams and healthcare systems
face barriers to effective HPV vaccine communication, and many questions remain unanswered about how to
increase the potency of provider recommendations. We propose the P01 Program Project, “Improving Provider
Announcement Communication Training (IMPACT).” The goal of IMPACT is to improve HPV vaccine
communication and uptake among adolescents. IMPACT's specific aims are to 1) Identify opportunities to
improve HPV vaccine communication; 2) Evaluate the impact and cost of HPV vaccine communication
interventions in cluster randomized clinical trials; and 3) Support implementation of HPV vaccine
communication interventions in healthcare systems. The IMPACT Program Project's shared theme is
amplifying the impact of a Research-Tested Intervention Program to improve HPV vaccine
communication in healthcare systems. The projects will work together to enhance the impact of the
Announcement Approach Training (AAT), an HPV vaccine communication training for primary care
professionals, which received designation as a Research-Tested Intervention Program (RTIP) from the
National Cancer Institute. Project 1 will establish how to involve the whole primary care team in HPV vaccine
recommendations. The project will examine whether optimizing the use of standing orders support increases
HPV vaccine uptake in clinics receiving the AAT. Project 2 will examine what motivates providers to
recommend HPV vaccination. The project will establish whether clinic-level financial incentives increase
vaccine uptake in clinics receiving the AAT. Project 3 will examine who should facilitate the trainings. The
project will establish whether engaging clinical champions in healthcare systems to implement the AAT within
their own systems increases vaccine uptake. Project 4 will examine which interventions fit systems' resources.
The project will examine the budget impact, cost-effectiveness, and population health impact of HPV vaccine
interventions in rural and nonrural communities and aid decision makers with a decision support tool to
facilitate the adoption of promising interventions. The research projects will receive support from 3 cores:
Administrative, Data, and Intervention. IMPACT's activities will culminate with the creation of the AAT
Intervention Package to support improving HPV vaccine uptake in healthcare systems. Throughout the
proposed Program Project, the shared theme and AAT focus will create synergies among the projects and
cores that generates significant and novel scientific insights into how to improve HPV vaccine communication
and uptake. Our approach will also accelerate the evolution of communication trainings for primary care
professionals, accomplishing in 5 years what might otherwise take two decades."
10770433,"OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
For over two decades, the NIMH P30 HIV Neurobehavioral Research Center (HNRC) has been a leader in the
neuroHIV field, supporting research that has greatly advanced our understanding of the central nervous system
(CNS) consequences of HIV disease, as well as their predictors, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. In this
renewal application, we propose to continue supporting innovative, basic/mechanistic, clinical, and translational
studies of HIV, its treatment, and comorbidities. This will include studies of persistence (e.g., proviral epigenetics)
and eradication of HIV in the CNS (“cure” agenda) and the role of gut microbiome alterations in HIV-associated
CNS disorders. Depressive disorders have long been recognized to be highly prevalent among persons with HIV
(PWH) and, especially when combined with cognitive impairment, may result in adverse consequences in many
areas of public health concern, including poorer healthcare engagement, antiretroviral therapy effectiveness,
social engagement, and life quality. Using both dimensional and diagnostic assessment approaches to
depression and cognition, we aim to support research identifying and characterizing complex neurobehavioral
phenotypes in PWH, determining their underlying biological mechanisms (e.g., inflammation, gut dysbiosis), and
examining their effects on critical outcomes in PWH. These aims will be achieved by drawing on data and
biospecimens from a registry of over 1200 well characterized PWH and HIV-uninfected participants, who have
received comprehensive HNRC examinations during the last 5 years. During the proposed renewal period, we
also will enrich the HNRC data and biospecimen resource by conducting 200 comprehensive assessments per
year of registry participants who are identified on briefer semi-annual assessments as undergoing changes in
neuromedical status, mood, cognition, or everyday functioning. The HNRC Participant Registry also will be
refreshed with new participant enrollments. Together, these evaluations aim to determine the biological
mechanisms underpinning neurobehavioral changes in PWH, as well as their clinical risk factors and
consequences, with a view toward informing future interventions. This renewal builds on the track record of the
HNRC as a national and international leader and a resource that facilitates research on pathogenesis,
phenomenology, treatment, and prevention of neurobehavioral disturbances in PWH. To accomplish these goals,
we propose four redesigned Scientific Cores (NeuroBehavioral and Psychiatry, NeuroMedical, Microbiome, and
NeuroVirology and Biology) that will strongly support the HNRC aims and provide intellectual leadership and
technical support. An Administrative Core will support and coordinate their activities, and a Developmental Core
will support innovative pilot studies and coordinate training opportunities to help advance the careers of the next
generation of neuroHIV scientists."
10613165,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Brain circuits are dynamic networks of neurons that process information in the form of electrical and chemical
signals to form memories and shape behaviors. To investigate how brain circuits instantiate fundamental
computations underlying behaviors, we need to map their wiring diagrams coupled with functional analysis at
cellular resolution. However, the electrical (voltage) and chemical (e.g. neuropeptides) signals are not directly
visible, and current circuit tracing tools are insufficient for meaningful functional analysis. Using protein
engineering this proposal aims to develop a toolbox of genetically-encoded fluorescent reporters and tracers
specifically tailored to study neural circuits. At the electrical level, voltage sensors can image the precise timing
of action potentials and subthreshold voltage not detectable by other means. However, even the latest voltage
sensors do not perform well with high-resolution microscopes that use 2-photon illumination for imaging deep
in the brain. To overcome these limitations, we are taking a two-pronged approach by evolving amino acids at
the mechanistic heart of voltage sensor proteins and by using spectroscopy to aid our protein engineering efforts.
We believe directed evolution will improve voltage sensitivity and 2-photon functionality >10 fold, enabling us
to image currently invisible signals, like synaptic potentials, deep inside the brain. At the chemical level,
neuropeptides are highly expressed in almost all cortical neurons, but their role and impact in animals can only
be inferred because current detection methods, like microdialysis, are invasive and lack spatiotemporal
resolution. We are using phage display to evolve nanobodies capable of recognizing neuropeptides and coupling
their conformational changes to fluorescence changes from reporter molecules. These sensors will provide
visualization of neuropeptide release at cellular resolution throughout an animal’s brain during behavior
paradigms that mimic human health and disease states. At the cellular connectivity level, current tools for circuit-
mapping, like rabies virus, exhibit substantial neurotoxicity, prohibiting meaningful functional analyses. We are
engineering proteins with a natural propensity to assemble into structures capable of delivering a genetic
payload to specific cells to produce more effective and less toxic tools to map and manipulate brain circuits.
Effective and robust tools to map the brain will bridge functional and structural analysis and finally allow long-
term studies of neural networks based on their connectivity. Overall, the optogenetic tools developed in this
proposal will translate the chemical and electrical signals between neural circuits into fluorescence that can be
easily measured. Consequently, they can be used to unravel the functional basis and causes of neuronal disorders
at a level of detail that has not been accessible to date and empower us to develop novel treatments."

The goal of this National Eye Institute (NEI) P30 competitive renewal is to continue to enhance
the research activities of NEI-funded investigators at The University of Iowa. This will be
achieved by providing a suite of Core Services, performed by skilled technical staff and
supervised by experienced NEI-funded faculty members, employing standardized, automated
procedures when possible. We have modified the Core Services in this renewal application to
continue to provide the most up-to-date state-of-the-art services to meet the evolving needs of
NEI-funded faculty at The University of Iowa. The combination of centralization (allowing
specialization and concomitant increases in efficiency) and the breadth of services available
from the various Cores are expected to continue to provide utility and increased productivity to
all vision researchers at The University of Iowa.
The University of Iowa NEI P30 program is aimed at supporting three primary service cores: 1)
Molecular Imaging Core; 2) Rodent Phenotyping Core; and 3) Bioinformatics and Biostatistics
Core. The capabilities of and research activities provided by these cores all require specialized
equipment and highly trained staff that would be inefficient and costly to duplicate in every
laboratory seeking to employ these techniques."
11136650,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Innate immune receptors from the NLR protein family control basic organism-organism interactions across
kingdoms, including incompatibility within a species. Current availability of genomic biodiversity allows
us to examine patterns of innate immune receptor evolution. I propose that adaptive immunity has evolved
by adopting subsets of proteins domains already present in innate immunity as well as their diversification
mechanisms to act somatically in specialized cells. Testing this hypothesis through comparative genomics
will be paradigm-shifting to our understanding of immune system evolution. To do this, we will examine
evolution of protein domains involved in innate immunity across all available eukaryotic genomes,
determine sources of genomic diversity and how they change with the re-current evolution of adaptive
immunity across independent lineages. To test that there are targeted diversity generation mechanisms
acting on NLRs at the population level, we will examine patterns of NLR evolution on multiple scales,
including cross-kingdom analyses. We will test diversification mechanisms acting on them within species
lacking adaptive immunity, including model plants and fungi. In parallel, we will experimentally test
involvement of NLRs in fungal immunity, which has been proposed but yet to be experimentally validated.
Finally, we will conduct experimental evolution on both NLRs and their ligands to collect data for modeling
how new binding specificities arise on the population scale. Altogether, this project will fill in important
gaps in understanding the evolution of innate immune systems, including our own."

expanding AD/ADRD research; to accelerate efforts to identify early and pre-symptomatic stages of AD/ADRD;
and to educate the public about AD/ADRD. BU ADRC research themes are congruent with NIH AD/ADRD
Research Summit recommendations including: 1) research on heterogeneity and the multifactorial nature of
AD/ADRD; 2) molecular profiling of existing and new cohorts; and 3) developing new public-private
partnerships. We operationalize our mission through 7 tightly integrated cores: Administrative, Clinical (CC),
Data Management and Statistics (DMS), Biomarker, Neuropathology (NPC), Outreach/Recruitment,
Engagement (ORE), Genetics and Molecular Profiling (GMP) and a research education component (REC).
The Cores are focused on cutting edge research, proactive community engagement, training the next
generation of AD/ADRD clinicians and researchers, and sharing key material, data, and expertise both among
key partners and with the community at large. The BU ADRC has made significant contributions to the
remarkable growth of AD/ADRD research nationally and has actively contributed participants, biological
samples, clinical data, and scientific expertise to all major national AD/ADRD research initiatives. The BU
ADRC has been the catalyst for exciting new research on genetic and lifespan environmental risk factors and
AD/ADRD, particularly vascular risk and exposure to repetitive head impacts (RHI) from contact sports, military
service and other sources. Major BU ADRC research themes include studies on RHI from contact sports and
military service and risk for AD/ADRD, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and deep
phenotyping AD/ADRD heterogeneity with a range of complementary innovative approaches including digital
and EEG phenotyping; neuropathology; genetics; biostatistical modelling; biomarker discovery; and molecular
profiling. The BU ADRC will build on this strong record of accomplishment to support new research and
educate the next generation of AD/ADRD scientists. The BU ADRC will also support high risk high gain
innovative developmental projects focused on NAPA and NIA strategic goals and utilize our collective expertise
and experience to facilitate career development of investigators with diverse backgrounds. The BU ADRC will
develop new partnerships and enhance current partnerships with other ADRCs and national research
programs, foundations, advocacy groups and private organizations in our quest to prevent and treat AD/ADRD.
Exposure to RHI is associated with CTE and a wide range of other AD/ADRD pathologies. As recognized
leaders in this space, we are uniquely positioned to support research on genetic and other risks factors and
study how RHI affects the clinical course, biomarker profile, and clinical-pathological features of AD/ADRD
including CTE."
10926821,"Project Summary Abstract: Overall
Skin cancers are the most common cancers in the US, including melanoma and cutaneous squamous cell
carcinoma (cSCC). Despite substantial progress, most patients with advanced melanoma do not benefit from
treatment, while the most potent therapies of melanoma also cause serious adverse events. In addition, we still
need safe, efficient, and cost-effective therapies of cSCCs in immunocompetent and immunodeficient patients
that could transform treatment and outcomes for these at-risk patient populations. The overall goal of the
Melanoma and Skin Cancer Program (MSCP SPORE) is to develop novel translational research to overcome
the hurdles of current therapies of melanoma and cSCCs. Each of the three Projects results from seminal and
innovative findings made by the investigators of the MSCP SPORE, which are translated into new
combinatorial immunotherapy trials for patients with melanoma and skin cancers. Project 1 will assess the
clinical and immunological activity of anti-LAG3 alone and in combination with anti-PD1, for the first time, in
treatment-naïve MPs who have not received prior ICB. Project 2 will evaluate the efficacy, and immunogenicity
of CMP-001 (CMP), a type A CpG, in PD1 naïve metastatic melanoma in the context of a phase II/III
randomized clinical trial with intratumoral CMP and nivolumab (CMP/nivo) vs. nivo. Project 3 will test a novel
microneedle array (MNA) device to deliver both a potent chemotherapeutic agent to induce immunogenic cell
death and an innate immune stimulant into accessible cSCCs. This approach will be tested both in
immunocompetent and immunosuppressed cancer patients.The MSCP SPORE will use innovative strategies
to determine the mechanisms of response and resistance to the proposed therapies. The investigators will be
supported by shared-facility cores to provide state-of-the-art expertise and economies-of-scale in 1) sample
collection and processing, translational pathology, data annotation, biospecimen repository, and
immunomonitoring (Core 1); and 2) biostatistics and bioinformatics (Core 2), supporting rigor and
reproducibility across all research projects. The Career Enhancement Program (CEP) and Development
Research Program (DRP) will attract talented basic, translational, and clinical investigators into melanoma
research. The MSCP SPORE leverages Hillman Cancer center (HCC) resources and institutional commitment
with state-of-the-art research and clinical facilities, clinical regulatory services to support clinical trial
coordination, and translational research. The MSCP SPORE includes outstanding External and Internal
Advisory Boards (EAB, IAB), an Executive Committee that is highly experienced in the successful
management of SPOREs and Patient Advocates. The organizational structure of the MSCP SPORE will
facilitate thorough following of progress and managing of potential hurdles for each project. The MSCP SPORE
will share data with the scientific community and other SPOREs in agreement with the NIH policy. The MSCP
SPORE will benefit from and promote a large number of horizontal and vertical collaborations with academic
institutions, NCI, pharmaceutical companies, and cooperative groups."
11014634,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
After decades of cell death study, it is now well accepted that cell death can be highly programmed,
including some lytic forms. For example, the plasma membrane (PM) pore-forming executor for
necroptosis is MLKL, when phosphorylated by RIPK3. For pyroptosis, gasdermin family members
are the PM damaging executors, once processed by caspases or granzymes. Intriguingly, the PM
pore-forming is not the “point of no return” for necroptosis or pyroptosis. This is because ESCRT-
III complex can repair the damaged PM by membrane remodeling. The broken PM fractions can
be shed off. Therefore, for both necroptotic and pyroptotic cells, they can tolerate a limited level
of PM damage and survive for a long time if ESCRT-III repairing capacity is not overwhelmed. In
this grant, we presented our UNPUBLISHED data showing if a necrotic cell can manage to stay
alive, the sub-lethal PM damage is sufficient to initiate a sophisticated signal transduction network.
We named this signaling transduction pathway as Plasma Membrane Integrity signaling (PMI
signaling). PMI signals are efficient in promoting pro-tumor chemokines/cytokines secretions. We
hypothesize that the necrotic “survivors” can stimulate oncogenesis via the PMI signaling pathway
and the consequent chemokines/cytokines paracrine. Our ultimate goal is to mechanistically
understand and further target these “survivors” to improve cancer treatment. To achieve this end,
we will firstly hunt for the sensors for PM integrity loss. We proposed to test a promising ion
channel candidate that is very likely to be one of the sensors for PM damage. We have also
planned an elegant cell culture system to perform both siRNA and sgRNA screen to search for
the PM damage sensors genome-wide. Next, we will use both animal models and human
specimens to probe the necrotic “survivors.” We will further test the roles of the
chemokines/cytokines secreted by these “survivors” in tumorigenesis and metastasis. Third, we
will try to eliminate the necrotic “survivors” directly. Our preliminary data lead us to a candidate
RING E3 ligase. We will test whether targeting this E3 ligase can help us suppress the ESCRT-
III repair action and eradicate necrotic “survivors.” As the necrotic “survivors” were only
discovered not long ago (by us and others), the massive impacts of cell death “survivors” in
contributing to cancers, transplantation, and other illnesses are still fresh and needed to be fully
defined. Innovative research, like this one, will promote the revelation."

11090253,"The future of biomedicine will rely on the ability to integrate genotype and phenotype data contextually to
identify biomarkers, decipher mechanisms, reconstruct networks, and develop quantitative models by
biomedical and clinical researchers in a seamless manner. What would be extremely valuable is a webaccessible
one-stop shop providing these capabilities. Creating such seamless infrastructure is the
vision of our initiative. We propose the development of the Biomedical Data Commons Workbench
(BDCW), which will help overcome the fundamental barriers to biomedical data integration.
BDCW will address two fundamental barriers faced by biomedical researchers – the first deals with
the question, are there data available that can answer a biomedical question or questions (also
referred to from the research point of view as a Use Case) and second, how can such data be
integratively analyzed without having to go through the tedious process of either developing or
using a variety of tools (which in turn requires working knowledge of computational methods).
Several Common Fund data sources attempt to help the end-user vis-à-vis the data they provide, but not
the ability to seamlessly interoperate with another Common Fund data source. Even if one were to identify
the appropriate data sources to address a given research question, the challenge of integration of these
diverse data is non-trivial. Data integration refers to the task of combining information about the same
entities managed in different information systems to present a unified data view across different systems.
It also refers to integrative analyses of multiple types of data, including data collected at different biological
scales, to discover new knowledge as to how biological systems function (“mechanisms”)."
10849907,"In this AADCRC program renewal, we will focus on three critical and understudied innate immune factors
and how they impact viral infections in asthma: the anionic phospholipids of surfactant (palmitoyl-
oleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol, POPG, and phosphatidylinositol, PI), Toll interacting protein (Tollip), and
surfactant protein-A (SP-A). Because these mediators have complementary functions to modulate
inflammation and immunity in asthma and infection, we propose three interrelated, synergistic, self-standing
projects to investigate how these mediators orchestrate novel innate immune responses associated with viral
infections in asthma. We will study three viruses with a spectrum of effects in airway disease, and
determine how innate responses protect against them. Specifically, we will focus on rhinovirus C (RV-C), a
known exacerbator of asthma that can cause severe disease; influenza A, a virus whose effect in asthma remains
ambiguous and SARS-CoV-2, a virus that can cause severe lung disease, but for which asthma may not be a
risk factor, and may in fact confer protection. We show innovative preliminary data indicating that 1) POPG, PI
and SP-A attenuate RV-C infection; 2) Tollip exhibits protective effects as it is required for IL-13 to generate
soluble ST2 that in turn attenuates the effects of IL-33 during influenza A infection; and 3) SP-A and type 2
cytokines confer protection in the effector and initiation phases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in asthma by inhibiting
the expression and function of ACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, through effects upon transcription, receptor
binding and downstream pro-inflammatory signaling. Thus, all these innate immune components appear to
protect against viral infections in asthma. Our exciting preliminary data underpin our program’s overall
hypothesis that POPG/PI, Tollip and SP-A function as unique immune modulators that attenuate the
impact of specific viral infections (RV-C, Influenza A and SARS-CoV-2) in type-2 asthma. Therefore,
supplementation of functional POPG/PI, SP-A and the IL-33 decoy receptor sST2 may be novel strategies
against asthma exacerbations due to viral infections. Project 1 will critically test the activity of POPG/PI and SP-
A supplementation as a novel molecular tool for disrupting infections due to RV-C, a virus known to exacerbate
asthma. Project 2 will determine how Tollip protects against viral exacerbations caused by influenza A in asthma
through inhibition of IL-33 signaling. Project 3 will determine how type-2 cytokines and SP-A synergize to protect
against SARS-CoV-2 infection through inhibition of ACE2-mediated infection and IL-6 signaling pathways. We
also include an Administrative Core and a Clinical Core, both which serve all projects equally. We build upon
productive collaborations of over 20 years on innate molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between
type 2 inflammation and viral exacerbations of asthma. The strong synergy among our three projects will
accelerate progress toward novel therapies by demonstrating that the innate immune components under
study protect against viral infection in asthma."
10904884,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We propose to strengthen and extend the research capacity of the COBRE Center for the Computational
Biology of Human Disease (CBHD) at Brown University and affiliated hospitals. High throughput data from
multiple ‘omics-level’ technologies are fundamental factors in the identification and treatment of human disease.
The acquisition of these data is now straightforward, but the efficient and creative interpretation of these data
remain a serious impediment to progress for junior faculty in both the basic and translational aspects of
biomedical science. The underlying principle of this Center is that close collaboration between laboratory
scientists working with model systems and data scientists working with computational and bioinformatics tools
can accelerate the implementation of human disease research. In Phase 1, we established the CBHD COBRE
around a Computational Biology Core (CBC) and support for junior faculty Project Leaders (9) and Pilots Project
leaders (8). These Project Leaders have been awarded six NIH R01s, an R35 MIRA, an NIH T32 Training Grant,
an NIH R21, a USDA grant, a Sloan Award, and a Searle Award, totaling ~$17.9M. In Phase 2 we will strengthen
this research environment with support for four new Project Leaders and a plan for growth and sustainability of
the CBC that serves as the analysis and training hub of this COBRE. Our innovative joint mentoring strategy
where each Project Leader is advised by both computational and biological or clinical senior faculty members
has proven successful, and this will be extended. Moreover, we will build sustainable support for the CBC through
expanded collaboration with COBRE graduates and other faculty on external grant support plus internally funded
staff data scientists. The long-term goal of the Center is to grow a nexus of computational biology infrastructure
for the greater Brown and hospital environments that will benefit all of Rhode Island. The objective of this
proposal is to strengthen the infrastructure of the CBHD COBRE to ensure the transition of junior faculty Project
Leaders to R01-funded scientists, and raise the computational proficiency and diversity of the broader biomedical
research community. The three Aims are: Aim 1. Support the research of junior faculty Project Leaders pursuing
biological and computational approaches to human disease. Aim 2. Broaden the CBHD research environment
through enhanced Pilot and Mentoring programs that increase faculty recruitment and promote funding
independence for Project Leaders. Aim 3. Strengthen the Computational Biology Core through enhanced staffing
and broader access across the Brown biomedical community to build sustainability. The four new Research
Projects are: 1. Local Regulation of T-cell Differentiation and Function in the Reproductive Mucosa; 2: Profiling
Gene Expression and Mechanophenotype in Circulating Tumor Cells Ex Vivo; 3: Mapping Long-range Allosteric
Pathways in CRISPR-Cas9; 4: Modeling Long-range Regulatory Interactions to Predict Gene Expression Using
Graph Convolutional Networks."
10704493,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability. Of the 3.5 million Americans who sustain a
TBI every year, approximately 27,000 experience prolonged traumatic coma, the most severe form of TBI.
Less than 20% of these patients make a good recovery, and most are left with life-long disabilities. ICU
management of severe TBI focuses on monitoring intracranial pressure (ICP), but data from recently
conducted randomized clinical trials indicate that this approach is overly simplistic. Another approach is to
monitor the partial pressure of oxygen in brain tissue (PbtO2) and apply interventions to prevent brain tissue
hypoxia and improve neurologic outcome. Clinical studies demonstrate that brain tissue hypoxia is common,
that there is a strong relationship between low PbtO2 and poor outcome, and that timely interventions can
reverse brain tissue hypoxia. The first randomized controlled trial of PbtO2 monitoring in severe TBI, titled
“Brain Oxygen Optimization in Severe TBI (BOOST) Phase 2,” enrolled 122 subjects and demonstrated that
the mean hypoxia burden was reduced by 74% by the treatment protocol informed by PbtO2 monitoring (p <
0.0001), and there were no significant safety issues. There was a trend towards improved functional outcome,
supporting the pre-determined non-futility hypothesis. We are proposing the BOOST-3 trial to determine if
there is evidence of clinical efficacy of a treatment protocol based on PbtO2 monitoring compared to treatment
based on ICP monitoring alone. BOOST-3 will enroll patients with severe TBI requiring placement of ICP
monitors within 6 hours of presentation to a participating hospital. Patients will be randomized to a treatment
protocol based on ICP monitoring alone or the combination of ICP and PbtO2 monitoring. The Glasgow
Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E) measured at 6 months post injury will be the primary outcome. Other
secondary outcomes include functional, cognitive and behavioral assessments at 6 months, safety, survival to
discharge, shortened time to follow commands, and reduction of total brain hypoxia exposure."
11176616,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The ultimate goal in clinical transplantation is robust and specific host immunological tolerance toward
transplanted allogeneic tissue and cells. While systemic immunosuppression regimens have saved lives by
enabling long-term allogeneic graft survival, they come with a host of potentially severe side effects, including
infections and malignancies. The development of a method to induce donor-specific, localized tolerance toward
allogeneic grafts, and thereby eliminate the need for chronic systemic immunosuppression, would dramatically
reduce the risks associated with cell and tissue transplantation.
 Typical tolerogenic immunomodulatory approaches are systemic, potentially resulting in off-target and
detrimental effects. Many groups have turned toward local delivery or presentation of immunomodulatory factors,
which can eliminate systemic and off-target effects, but have limited opportunity for renewal when exhausted,
resulting in a transient treatment. One approach to achieve more persistent localized immunomodulation
includes the use of tolerogenic cells, such as T regulatory cells, tolerized mesenchymal stem cells or tolerized
antigen presenting cells. However, while these cells can be influenced to take on a tolerogenic phenotype in
vitro, it is unclear whether, or for how long, these manipulated cells maintain this phenotype in vivo. An alternative
strategy would be the use of professional tolerogenic cells, such as placenta-derived trophoblasts, wherein their
primary physiological role is sustained and persistent maintenance of tolerance toward allogeneic tissue.
 Our research approaches immunological tolerance from the perspective of the only physiologically natural
scenario of allogeneic tissue tolerance, placental pregnancy. In placental pregnancy, semi-allogeneic and fully
allogeneic conceptus are protected from immune response by the placenta, a fetus-derived organ consisting of
various types of trophoblasts which physically isolate the fetus from the mother. We aim to probe and exploit the
tolerogenic immunomodulatory mechanisms of trophoblasts and their capacity to induce tolerance in allogeneic
graft transplantation through three main projects: (1) develop artificial placenta organoids using tunable hydrogel
matrices to direct trophoblast differentiation and explore their immunomodulatory mechanisms in vitro; (2)
engineer a safe and translatable method of artificial placenta organoid transplantation for tolerogenic cell therapy;
(3) develop a tolerance-inducing vaccine via implantation of artificial placenta organoids for antigen-specific
tolerance against allogeneic grafts. The use of placenta-based mechanisms to induce tolerance toward
allogeneic grafts is a drastically understudied area of immunology, and presents an opportunity to widen and
enrich the broader research areas of transplantation and transplantation immunology."
10873068,"Project Summary – IADRC Overall
The Indiana Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (IADRC) was established in 1991 to bring investigators and
institutional resources at the Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM) together to address the fundamental
causes and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD). Despite many important
gains, the need for targeted research is greater than ever, with an estimated 5.8 million people in the U.S.
suffering from AD/ADRD. Unfortunately, we do not yet know how to prevent AD or have an approved disease
modifying intervention. Both are critical to stem the growth in dementia prevalence. The overarching goal of the
IADRC going forward is to support the goal of the NAPA to prevent and effectively treat AD by 2025, through
innovative research on etiology, early detection, and therapeutics. Biomarker studies indicate that processes
leading to AD begin at least 20 years prior to dementia, suggesting that successful interventions must be
implemented early. This presents a potential opportunity for early intervention, but the field is challenged by
critical barriers decreasing the prospects of timely success. The IADRC has identified the barriers as: a) The
current understanding of etiology and pathophysiology is fragmented and incomplete; b) Sensitive, specific, and
cost-effective methods for early detection are not available; c) Therapeutic development is hampered by the
heterogeneity and complexity of ADRD; d) Shortage of data and translational scientists; and, e) Inadequate
diversity at all levels. The IADRC specific aims entail innovation to overcome these barriers and accelerate
research toward prevention and effective treatment: 1) Support, enhance, and expand innovative research on
ADRD targeting causes, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention; 2) Provide critical research resources and
infrastructure to support existing studies and enable new innovative research, utilizing a well-characterized
longitudinal clinical cohort, with prioritization of diverse populations including underrepresented groups (URG)
and those in preclinical and early symptomatic phases, including subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive
impairment, which will help to advance the identification of easily accessible biomarkers for early detection; 3)
Identify and prioritize novel therapeutic targets from high-throughput approaches with rapid translation to proof-
of-concept studies using genetic and other enrichment strategies for better biological targeting and reduction of
phenotypic and biological heterogeneity for more efficient and cost-effective clinical trials; 4) Increase the number
of investigators with deep expertise in advanced data sciences to bridge cellular/molecular processes of
neurodegeneration and clinical phenotypes, as well as clinical and translational researchers who can move
therapeutic approaches from model systems to clinical trials; 5) Provide educational and training opportunities
related to dementia for a broad array of learners, with special emphasis on increasing participation from URG in
ADRD related research and healthcare specialties. The IADRC is well-positioned to help achieve the NIA/NAPA
goals through sustained and impactful contributions towards prevention and treatment of AD/ADRD."

 The University of Kansas Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (KU ADRC) promotes Alzheimer's
Disease and Related Disorders (ADRD) research at local, national, and international levels. Our strengths in
basic and translational mitochondria, lifestyle modification, and prevention research define a metabolism theme
we pursued and refined over the past decade. We boast a sophisticated and mature infrastructure that
advances a better understanding of AD, better care of affected persons, and new treatment interventions. The
KU ADRC will use its intellectual and infrastructure assets this next cycle to drive AD research at a university
vested and investing in our success, and in doing so move the field closer to a cure.
 Our Center moves seamlessly between bench and bedside, both in terms of the research projects we
support, and in the infrastructure required to back investigator projects. Lifestyle intervention research
generates fundamental mechanistic questions we call on wet lab investigators to address, and questions of
clinical implementation and practice are now the focus of dry lab, clinical, and health care delivery
investigators. Research addressing AD's mitochondrial component demonstrate a role for mitochondrial genes
in AD risk, that mitochondria play a critical role in cell proteostasis and protein aggregation, specific links
between mitochondria and AD hallmark proteins, and how to manipulate brain energy metabolism through
lifestyle and pharmacologic approaches. To date these efforts led us to create novel compounds that constitute
a unique therapeutic pipeline, and clinical trial infrastructure that supports actual studies of metabolism
interventions in actual AD patients.
 For the 2021-26 cycle we will use our intellectual and infrastructure assets to address critical gaps in the
AD field, including gaps in fundamental knowledge and care implementation. During this cycle the KU ADRC
will work to (1) Empower innovative AD and brain aging research, education, and clinical programs; (2) Drive
field-defining metabolism research, and (3) Bring practical and novel metabolism-directed therapies to the
bedside and clinic."
10947446,"SUMMARY
Congenital anomalies represent an increasing burden of disease worldwide, accounting for millions of birth
defect-related disabilities with a disproportionate impact on Low to Middle Income Countries (LIMCs). Many
harbor genetic etiologies, for which no confirmatory diagnosis can be made due to the dearth of diagnostic
technologies in most LMICs. The inability to rapidly and accurately diagnose individuals that harbor a genetic
syndrome increases the risk of mortality and morbidity (as a number of manageable congenital anomalies may
be hidden, such as congenital heart defects or hearing infections) and prevents the accurate determination of
prevalence rates, critical for public health surveillance and intervention programs.
The first part (R21) of this project addresses these gaps using two synergistic mobile health intervention tools
to screen for syndromic conditions and specifically demonstrate that a specific diagnostic of Down syndrome
(expandable to all aneuploidies and those diseases resulting from copy number variants, point mutations and
insertions/deletions) can be performed with minimal resources, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC).
Aim 1 will be to train and validate AI-guided smartphone-based technology to screen for syndromic
conditions, while Aim 2 will create low-cost, rapid initial genetic diagnostic capacity in the DRC.
In the expansion part of the proposal (R33), we will test whether the implementation of a registry measuring
health outcomes can be used as a scalable model for future newborn screening and health surveillance in a
low-resource setting. To this effect, Aim 3 will build infrastructure for birth defects detection, genetic
confirmation, competence building, and practice and outcomes surveillance in low-resource conditions
with two parallel sub-aims: Aim 3a will assess the feasibility of the diagnostic capacity on a large
population sample and provide a tool to measure specific health outcomes, while Aim 3b will establish a
small-scale and functional database/registry of morphological, genetic, and health outcomes data.
In limited resources settings, comprehensive systems to detect, refer, treat and surveil individuals with
congenital anomalies are non-existent. Our innovative technologies will address this gap, build local capacity of
diagnostic screening and of a data registry, allowing for early diagnosis and condition-specific care, likely to
lower morbidity and mortality of children with non-communicable syndromic conditions."

cores and one component, which align with the recommendations of the 2017 NIA strategic plan, including
studies that: 1) recognize the heterogeneity and multifactorial nature of dementias; 2) support extensive
molecular profiling to fill the gaps in large-scale human data needed to build predictive models of disease and
wellness; 3) employ new research paradigms, e.g., systems biology, human cell modeling; 4) enable rapid and
extensive sharing of data, disease models, specimens, and support open and team science; 5) develop
computational tools and infrastructure for storage, integration, and analysis of large-scale biological and
patient-relevant data; 6) build multidisciplinary translational teams in virtual and real spaces; 7) develop new
pre-competitive public-private partnerships; 8) change academic, publishing, and funding incentives to promote
collaborative, transparent, and reproducible research; and 9) engage patients, caregivers, and citizens as
direct partners in research.
The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership to the Rush ADRC as a whole. The Religious Orders
Study (ROS) Core will recruit and conduct annual evaluations of Catholic clergy without dementia who agree to
organ donation. The Clinical and Latino Cores will collect data harmonized with on Blacks and Latinos without
dementia and work to obtain brain autopsy. The Neuropathology Core will process, store, evaluate and
distribute biospecimens obtained by the Clinical, ROS, and Latino Cores. The Outreach, Recruitment, and
Engagement Core will provide a wide range of educational programs to support outreach and recruitment of
racial and ethnic minorities into the Clinical, ROS and Latino Cores, and other NIA funded initiatives. The
Biomarker/Neuroimaging Core will process neuroimaging generated with other funds from all three Cores and
affiliated studies, and document neuroimaging and biofluid biomarker data. The new Research and Education
Component will provide structured mentoring of students and faculty at all levels. The Data Management and
Statistical Core will provide the infrastructure that allows all other Cores and the REC to be maximally
successful and impactful and will provide statistical support to users of ADRC resources especially junior
investigators and trainees."

Metastatic disease is responsible for the vast majority of cancer mortality. Understanding of the fundamental
mechanisms leading to metastatic cancer has been hampered by the need for models that replicate the step-
wise metastatic process in vivo, yet are amenable to tight control and facilitate high-resolution, time-lapse
imaging and quantitative analysis of cell behavior. Over the past decade, our team has developed in vivo and
in vitro methods capable of simulating many steps of the metastatic cascade including tumor cell invasion,
intravasation, trapping in the microcirculation or adhesion to the vessel walls, and extravasation into the
surrounding extracellular matrix. In parallel, we have developed computational studies that provided detailed
insights often not possible through experiments. This collective prior work has shed new light on central aspects
of single-cell and collective cell behavior during metastasis, and identified mechanical adaptations and
vulnerabilities of the tumor cell with promise for targeted interventions. The goal of our proposed U54 Center is
to employ these developed assays and methods in combination with new measurement techniques to interrogate
the full spectrum of stressors experienced by tumor cells in the metastatic niche during arrest and extravasation,
and couple these with parallel studies of changes in chromatin structure and the transcriptome of tumor cells
(Core B). These changes are critical to mechano-adaptation of the tumor cells towards an organ-preferential
initiation of a metastatic colony or transition to dormancy. A hallmark of our proposed center is the use of state-
of-the-art in vitro (Project 1) and in vivo (Project 2) experiments and computation (Core A) to uncover and probe
the factors that ultimately determine tumor cell fate. We anticipate that such integrated studies will provide new
insights into metastatic cancer, not possible by the use of any method alone, and enhance our ability to identify
and screen for new therapies to inhibit the tendency for metastatic spread of disease."

11062757,"Abstract
 The nervous system requires tight control of transcription for processes such as learning and memory
formation. The field of epigenetics seeks to understand how changes to gene transcription occur in response to
environmental cues and external signals such as those that our brains experience during learning. This proposal
lies at the intersection of neuroscience and epigenetics, with a particular focus on chromatin biology. Chromatin
is the complex of DNA and the histone proteins that wrap up DNA into complex structures, recruit key
transcriptional regulators, and in doing so, control gene expression. In recent years, it has become clear that
disruptions to chromatin regulation lead to a range of neurological and mental health disorders such as post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, we have a limited understanding of how chromatin functions in the
brain or how its disruption can lead to disease. We will apply the tools and techniques of the epigenetics field to
the study of neuronal function. In doing so, we hope to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that allow our brains
to perform incredibly complex tasks and how disruption of these mechanisms can lead to neuronal dysfunction.
 We propose overcome long-standing hurdles in the field using a combination of novel techniques to
reveal how the epigenetic landscape encodes the transcriptional changes that underlie memory formation.
Specifically, we seek to uncover the transcriptional signature of memory formation and memory maintenance
within single neurons in an in vivo context. We then will examine the epigenetic underpinnings of this
transcriptional signature and manipulate specific components of the chromatin environment to define their
contribution to learning and memory maintenance. First, in order to elucidate the gene program associated with
learning, we will use single-nucleus RNA-sequencing in combination with mouse models that label the specific
neurons activated during learning. This will allow us to examine the transcriptional programs activated in neurons
that form a memory engram compared to their neighboring cells at various times after learning. Next, we will
employ a quantitative biochemical approach uniquely available to our group as part of the Epigenetics Institute
to characterize the chromatin landscape changes the occur during memory formation, memory maintenance,
and reversal learning. Finally, we will modify the chromatin landscape by manipulating specific histone proteins
in combination with numerous sequencing approaches to elucidate how chromatin controls learning and the
transcriptional program. Employing this novel combination of techniques will allow us to uncover the mechanisms
through which the epigenome encodes information within neurons to modify behavior both in the context of
normal learning and in the context of maladaptive responses that lead to disorders such as PTSD. If successful,
these methods will 1) identify the transcriptional signature that encodes a memory in neurons, 2) map how this
signature is encoded by specific epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, and 3) define how the chromatin landscape
affects memory formation and contributes to mental health disorders."

Interpreting individual genome sequence and the consequence of any sequence variation is critical for the study
of the genetic basis of diseases and the path toward precision medicine. Genomic sequence is at the basis of
multiple levels of genome regulation which are highly intertwined, including chromatin protein binding, 3D
genome architecture, and gene transcription. Decoding these regulatory functions directly from the sequence will
provide a computational platform for scalable prediction of variant effects and interrogation of base pair-level
sequence functions with “in silico mutagenesis”. Progress has been made in decoding regulatory genomic
sequence, including with the development of deep learning sequence models. However, the sequence-basis of
complex phenomena such as transcriptional regulation will not be fully resolved without accounting for genome
structure and long-range 3D sequence context. Genome structures at multiple spatial scales, including promoter-
enhancer interactions, transcriptional condensates, topologically associating domains, chromatin compartments,
and nuclear bodies can have strong impacts on transcriptional regulation. With data and techniques that have
only now become sufficient to tackle this challenge, we will study these phenomena and trace complex regulatory
output back to the basis of sequence dependencies by developing sequence models of 3D genome regulatory
architecture. We will develop a computational framework of deep learning sequence models with the capability
of modeling multiscale 3D genome interactions and integrating long-range sequence
information, for comprehensively interpreting the regulatory functions of genome sequence. The proposed work
will open up new possibilities for interpreting and applying structural and transcriptional impacts of sequence
variations, including asking how genetic factors, such as large structural variants, affect gene expression through
remodeling of genome structural organization in healthy and disease states."
11111632,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Human antibody repertoire is highly diverse due to VDJ recombination and somatic hypermutation. VDJ
recombination is a somatic recombination process that assembles the variable region of an antibody from a
diverse set of gene segments, known as variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) genes. During the course of
an immune response, antibodies will increase affinity to their antigens through somatic hypermutation. The
huge diversity of antibodies enables human immune system to confer protection against various pathogens by
recognizing a wide range of antigens and epitopes. Detailed molecular characterization of antibody-antigen
interaction is crucial to vaccine and therapeutic development, as well as the fundamental understanding of the
human immune system.
 The binding specificity and epitope of an antibody are determined by its structure, which in turn is
determined by its amino acid sequence. As a result, information on the binding specificity and epitope of an
antibody are encoded in its amino acid sequence. However, accurately predicting the epitopes of antibodies
from their sequences is an extremely difficult task because our understanding of antibody sequence-function
relationship is far from comprehensive. This proposal aims to develop a library-to-library screening approach to
characterize antibody-antigen interaction in a high-throughput manner, with a focus on influenza A
hemagglutinin (HA) as a proof-of-concept. Specifically, we will determine the HA-binding specificity and
conformational epitope of hundreds of thousands of antibodies in a single experiment. Subsequently, antibody
sequence features that are associated with different epitopes on HA will be systematically identified. We further
aim to use these antibody features to identify HA-binding antibodies from publicly available antibody repertoire
sequencing datasets as well as predict their epitopes on HA. While this proposed project focuses on influenza
HA, our approach can be easily extended to any antigen of interest. This proposal will open up the possibility
for antibody sequence-based epitope prediction and provides new perspectives to the understanding of human
antibody repertoire."
11009677,"Project Summary
An emerging theme in personalized medicine is the central role of metabolic dysfunction in disease and treatment
response. As metabolic changes occur earlier than morphological changes, there are significant and untapped
opportunities to incorporate metabolic markers into medical imaging. While medical imaging is an indispensable
resource for the diagnosis and prognosis of disease, we do not have a way to reliably, repeatably, and non-
invasively image metabolic abnormalities. Despite the mounting evidence that metabolism is involved in disease
onset, treatment response and resistance, and prognosis, crucial metabolic information is left unexplored and
uncharacterized. To facilitate a new paradigm in medical imaging and clinical decision making, I propose the
development of a novel investigative approach termed “metaboloradiomics.” Metaboloradiomics will incorporate
non-invasive metabolic imaging with conventional morphological imaging into a metabolism driven -omics model.
By overcoming the existing challenges of clinical magnetic resonance spectroscopy data collection, analysis,
and integration, combined with a suite of innovative computational tools, my vision is to enable an entirely new
approach to magnetic resonance imaging that will enable researchers and clinicians to routinely characterize the
role of metabolism in disease. The proposed research will facilitate a paradigm shift in magnetic resonance-
based medical imaging and is ideally suited to the New Innovator Award mechanism. These methods will be
applicable to a wide range of diseases, spanning the missions of multiple NIH Institutes and Centers. As a new
investigator, my cross-disciplinary background in chemistry and biomedical engineering, combined with
immersion in a clinical radiology department, has provided me with a unique skillset and specific expertise to
execute this high-risk and high-impact research."

More than 90% of older Americans would prefer to stay in their homes as long as possible as they age.
However, the prevalence of chronic illness including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's disease related
dementias (ADRD) can make the goal of successful aging at home out of reach without substantial support. At-
home health care technologies hold significant promise to provide many needed forms of support, but have not
been specifically developed for older adults, AD/ADRD patients, caregivers, and their clinicians. Many existing
health monitoring technologies are burdensome to use for older adults, are not sufficiently accurate, have
specific algorithmic biases, and lack adequate usability, and the resulting deluge of data often fails to provide
information that can usefully inform caregivers and support clinical decisions. Further, many current treatment

patient needs and caregiver abilities over time.
The Massachusetts AI and Technology Center for Connected Care in Aging and Alzheimer's Disease
(MAITC) is a multidisciplinary Center spanning five sites – the University of Massachusetts Amherst, Brigham
and Women’s Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, Brandeis University and Northeastern University –
that aims to foster interdisciplinary research on the development, validation and translation of emerging AI-
enhanced technologies to enhance connections between older adults, caregivers, and clinicians in order to
more effectively support healthy aging as well as the care of patients with AD/ADRD at home. To achieve this
objective, MAITC will pursue the five aims. The first is to apply a rigorous process which involves eliciting
stakeholder needs to drive the foci of pilot studies and identifying promising technologies suitable for
incorporation into pilot research projects. The second is to form and support a multidisciplinary community of
engineers, computer scientists, behavioral scientists, medical researchers, nurses and clinicians working to
advance the goals of the MAITC. The third is to provide access to state-of-art validation facilities, diverse
cohorts across rural and urban areas, and translation and commercialization services to enable rapid, robust
and multi-faceted validation and translation of AI-enhanced technologies. The fourth is to administer a pilot
project granting process and ensure that the pilot projects are responsive to stakeholder needs, use emerging
AI and related technologies that have significant potential to improve interactions between older adults, lay
caregivers, and clinicians. The fifth is to provide training to developers, clinicians, and other stakeholders and
to disseminate findings to diverse research, development and practice communities to accelerate further
development of promising technologies and promote the adoption of validated technologies beyond the
MAITC. Through these coordinated efforts, we hope to improve the lives of older adults and their caregivers."
10847476,"The long-term objective of this application is to define the relationship between infant respiratory syncytial virus
(RSV) infection and the host response that enables asthma inception, data needed to develop RSV and
asthma prevention strategies. There is abundant evidence that children who experience severe RSV during
infancy are at greater risk for developing asthma later in childhood; however, the host and viral determinants
that lead to asthma development are not known. In our prior funding cycle, we conducted a study considering
RSV infection in infancy as a natural quasi-random event and demonstrated that infant RSV infection, not only
severe infection, is associated with increased asthma risk, and that missing RSV infection during infancy
protects from asthma development. Furthermore, we demonstrated the mediating effect of infant RSV infection
on the developing airway microbiome and immune development and risk of wheeze, and in preliminary data,
the effect of RSV on long-term airway epithelial cell metabolism. Our overarching hypothesis for this proposal
is that age-dependent effects of infant RSV infection contribute to chronic respiratory disease through altering
DNA methylation (DNAm) of the airway epithelium, and airway epithelial metabolism and developmental
programming, and that identifying gene x RSV interactions will explain extremes of asthma susceptibility
following infant RSV infection. This proposal leverages rich data sets and birth cohorts to address these
hypotheses, and has the potential to greatly advance understanding of the mechanisms and developmental
processes underlying the effect of RSV on recurrent wheeze and asthma. To test these hypotheses we will use
a combination of two human natural quasi-randomization studies of infant RSV infection specifically designed
to assess effects of infant RSV infection on subsequent respiratory health and the airway epithelium, in vitro
models of RSV infection of nasal airway epithelial cells (NAECs), along with cutting edge-laboratory and
analytic approaches to integrate the resultant complex data. Project 2 leverages data from the INSPIRE cohort
that revealed that increased infant blood levels at birth of L-citrulline (L-CIT) were significantly associated with
decreased odds of infant bronchiolitis. These data suggested that higher blood levels of L-CIT at time of birth
protected against infant bronchiolitis and may protect against the development of asthma later in childhood.
We hypothesize that compared to regular diet (RD), an L-CIT supplemented diet (L-CITsd) fed to parents
during gestation and their offspring prevents severe RSV bronchiolitis in the offspring. Our preliminary data
strongly support this hypothesis and reveal that the L-CITsd decreased RSV-induced lung IL-13 expression,
reduced the frequency of lung IL-13 expressing ILC2, and restrained airways responsiveness. Further, L-
CITsd significantly decreased ILC2 expression of IL-13 when the cells were stimulated ex vivo with IL-33, and
L-CIT added to ILC2 culture inhibited IL-33-induced IL-13 production. These studies support that L-CITsd is a
therapeutic target to decrease the risk for severe RSV bronchiolitis and subsequent childhood asthma."
11062756,"Project Summary/Abstract
Many functions of the nervous system, such as learning and memory, inferring cause and effect, and predicting
future outcomes, depend upon the brain’s ability to perceive and form memories of the temporal duration of
events. Despite progress in establishing the neural basis of timing on the scale of milliseconds and circadian
timing over hours, many fundamental questions remain about time encoding on the intermediate scale of interval
timing (i.e. seconds to minutes). To investigate how interval time is represented in the brain, I developed a novel
behavioral approach (Heys and Dombeck, 2018) and a novel surgical and optical approach to enable large-
scale, cellular-resolution functional imaging in MEC in the behaving mouse (Heys et al., 2014). By combining
these imaging and behavioral methods, I discovered a previously unknown population of neurons in MEC that
encode interval time, whereby individual time-encoding neurons become regularly activated at a specific moment
during an interval timing task (Heys and Dombeck, 2018). I then established that MEC is critical for interval timing
during learning (Heys et al., In Press). This previous work has positioned my laboratory to address fundamental
questions regarding the neural circuit and synaptic mechanisms underlying interval timing. We will test a novel
conceptual framework, whereby time is encoded through a multi-stage process. In the first stage of this model,
a neural clock generates a context-independent representation of elapsed time. In the second stage, a
downstream circuit reads out the clock and associates time with other features of experience, such as spatial
context. Building upon my published, this proposal will test the hypothesis that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)
serves as an upstream neural clock, providing context-independent temporal information to medial entorhinal
cortex (MEC), which in turn integrates elapsed time with spatial context. To test this model, I will apply my cutting-
edge imaging techniques to record and manipulate neural activity from synapses and dendrites, up to thousands
of individual neurons simultaneously in awake behaving mice (Heys et al. 2014) during virtual-reality behavioral
paradigms that allow precise control of timing behavior (Heys and Dombeck, 2018). Using this approach, we will
first evaluate the ability of ACC axons terminating in MEC to serve as a neural clock signal in MEC. Second, we
will determine whether MEC encodes a context-dependent representation of time by integrating synaptic input
from ACC with spatial coding input from other upstream brain regions. Third, we will identify the synaptic and
dendritic mechanisms underlying cellular integration of context-dependent representations of time in MEC. This
proposal will have a far-reaching influence on cellular, systems and cognitive neuroscience. As interval timing is
a fundamental component of essentially all major brain functions, understanding the neural mechanisms of
interval timing, from synaptic to population level neural coding, will provide a basis for understanding how the
brain performs all complex functions that depend upon encoding of time on the scale of seconds to minutes."

The overall aim of the Cole Eye Institute (CEI) Core Facilities for Vision Research is to facilitate the analysis of the structure,
function and disease mechanisms that affect the visual system by providing centralized assess to shared resources. The Core
Facilities will provide resources, expertise and equipment to aid in the research endeavors of a vibrant and highly
collaborative group of vision science investigators at CEI of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. The long-term goal of the
investigators served by this grant is to prevent blindness and restore vision in diseases such as Retinopathy of Prematurity,
Diabetic Retinopathy. AMD and Inherited Retinal Degenerations. To this end we have developed a series of Core modules
that will continue to provide state-of-the-art instrumentation and technologies required for vision research. The three Core
modules are: (1) Ocular Imaging Core; (2) Functional Vision Core; and (3) Molecular Informatics Core. These Cores contain
equipment that is maintained and operated by highly skilled technicians that are supervised by established research scientists.
Consolidating these technologies into the three Cores allows us to bring these techniques and skills to all potential users in
our program, which we anticipate will continue to increase productivity in the user laboratories and avoid duplication of
equipment and effort. Successful operation of these three Cores will bring the best of these technologies to each of the NEI
RO1 supported laboratories in this institution. We also envision that these Core modules will continue to enhance and sustain
the collaborative scientific environment that is a strong feature of the CEI Vision research group. The Cores will also
enhance productivity among the participating investigators as in the previous grant cycle and allow junior investigators to
have access to services and research strategies that will help generate preliminary data to support new RO1 applications."

Continued support is requested for the NEI Core Grant for Vision Research that supports investigators of the
Atlanta Vision Research Community (AVRC). This Center Grant renewal application includes three
Resource/Service Cores: (1) Structural Biology and Imaging, (2) Functional Genomics and Proteomics, and (3)
Bioinformatics and Biostatistics. The AVRC Core grant supports collaborative vision research and service
among 23 faculty with 18 eligible NEI funded R01s, 24 postdoctoral fellows, and 38 predoctoral fellows. This
support comes largely via the expertise and service of AVRC personnel, their training of AVRC faculty and staff,
and the availability of equipment, supplies, and other resources. In the past 5 years, the Core grant contributed
to the generation of 193 peer-reviewed publications and to many new and competing renewal NEI-funded
R01s. During the next 5 years, we are actively recruiting 5-7 junior research tenure-track faculty who will re-
invigorate the AVRC and the EEC, increasing the need, value, and scientific impact of this P30 Core grant.
The Structural Biology and Imaging (SBI) Core provides resources and services for members of the AVRC with
regard to determining the relationship between normal and abnormal structure of ocular structures in healthy
tissue and in disease models with and without experimental therapies. Support is provided for structure-
function studies with an emphasis on retinal function, retinal degeneration/injury, RPE morphometry, ocular
oncology and gene/drug delivery. The Core supports ultrasonography, immunohistochemistry, confocal
microscopy, fluorescence image analysis, and light and electron microscopy services.
The goal of the Functional Genomics and Proteomics (FG&P) Core is to enhance research that increases our
understanding of how biological function (e.g., vision) arises from the information encoded in an organism's
genome and is modified by epigenetics. The Core supports molecular, biochemical, and phenotypic
experiments via six sections: DNA/RNA services, protein/small molecule analysis, cell culture, and
ocular/vision structural and functional analysis, rodent ocular microsurgery, and mouse colony services.
Approaches include scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, SD-OCT, fundus imaging, precision micrometry,
photorefraction, rebound tonometry, ERG, OKT, HPLC, LC-MS, PCR, LCM, immunoblotting and ELISA, flow-
cytometry, protein sequencing, microarray analysis, and NexGen sequencing.
The Bioinformatics and Biostatistics (Bioanalysis) Core provides biostatistics, bioinformatics, data management,
electronic notebooks, data backups, and advanced computational analyses. The support includes effort of
Core-dedicated informaticists and statisticians, advanced software, and cloud-computing access.
An Advisory Committee aids the Core directors to insure full and equitable use of the facilities and to advise on
creation of new resources based on need or elimination of components that are underutilized. The Cores have
increased and will continue to increase research productivity by providing common services to stimulate and
facilitate collaborative studies among faculty and to attract other academic disciplines to vision research."

Metastasis, the dissemination of cells from the primary tumor to other organs in the body, leads to 90% of the
1,800 daily cancer deaths. Cell invasion is an essential feature of tumorigenesis, which is necessary for tumor
growth, local invasion and metastatic outgrowth. The local tumor microenvironment, composed of stromal and
immune cells, the vasculature and extracellular matrix, provides tumor cells with numerous chemical, biophysical
and electrical cues that promote local invasion and support tumorigenesis. However, one major component of
the TME whose function has not been well studied and whose therapeutic potential in cancer has not been
explored is nerves. Perineural invasion has been associated with tumor aggressiveness by providing a path for
cancer cell invasion, however, for a long time, these nerves were not seen as major drivers of tumor growth and
metastasis. The lack of clinical approaches to prevent, diagnose and treat metastatic disease are largely due to
a poor understanding of targetable pathways for preventing and treating migrating cells. My goal is to investigate
a poorly studied component of tumors: their neuronal identity, which will provide new strategies for prevention
and targeting of metastatic cancer.
First, we will focus on elucidating the mechanisms by which neoneurogenesis of solid tumors occurs, which will
lead us to evaluate the systemic effects of nerves on local invasion and metastasis. Second, we will dissect the
neuronal identity of epithelial tumors, by studying how neuronal mimicry in metastasizing cells contributes to
tumor progression. Together, our findings will contribute to the development of non-invasive monitoring of
neuronal activity in solid tumors and the repurposing of FDA-approved drugs that target neuronal function for
use in metastatic disease. The research described in this proposal has the potential to impact both our basic
understanding of the role of the TME in tumor metastasis as well as lead to the development of novel detection
and treatment approaches for metastatic disease.
The neuronal identity of tumors is not well understood. Nerves have mostly been regarded as passive bystanders
to dissemination and deemed to contribute to tumor phenotypes only via the molecules they secrete. A thorough
literature review identified fewer than 40 primary papers directly investigating tumor cell-cancer crosstalk in solid
tumors, and fewer than 7 papers focused on breast cancer. The majority of published studies focus on the central
nervous system. With over 90% of tumors occurring outside of the brain, it is critical that we gain a better
understanding of how peripheral nerves interact with tumor cells. The extensive and unique expertise of Dr.
Oudin in both in neuroscience and cancer metastasis suggests her lab provides the perfect setting in which to
study this novel topic."
11176615,"Project Summary/Abstract:
There is an urgent need to develop new approaches to induce broadly protective immunity against rapidly
mutating viruses. The induction of protective immunity requires the development of memory lymphocytes that
can rapidly recognize and neutralize the virus upon re-infection. Virus-specific memory B cells are long-lived
cells that are critical for the establishment of protective immunity by vaccines. Memory B cells mediate
protective immunity by rapidly differentiating into antibody secreting cells upon antigen re-encounter. Memory
B cells that re-encounter antigen can also undergo further mutation of their B cell receptor to increase their
affinity for viral antigen. Induction of broadly reactive memory B cells through iterative exposure to cross-
reactive viral antigens is an emerging vaccination strategy designed to protect against rapidly mutating viruses.
However, efforts to induce broadly reactive memory B cells have been hindered by the relative inefficiency with
which memory B cells diversify their B cell receptor following antigen re-encounter. Better understanding of the
mechanisms governing memory B cell development is necessary to facilitate the design of vaccines capable of
eliciting a broadly protective memory B cell response.
Additionally, effective harnessing of memory B cells to protect against mucosal viruses requires understanding
how memory B cells develop and function in barrier tissues. Memory cells are critical for the establishment of
barrier immunity, with lung-resident memory B cells recently identified as essential to elicit a rapid and robust
local antibody response following influenza challenge. However, a lack of clarity regarding the pathways
regulating memory B cells development in barrier tissues remains a significant barrier to designing vaccines
capable of inducing tissue-resident memory B cells.
This project proposes to characterize how the tissue microenvironment shapes the development of memory B
cells following viral infection. This project will first determine how viral- and tissue-specific cues influence the
transcriptional profile of memory B cells. This proposal will then identify key transcriptional regulators of
memory B cell development in barrier tissues and investigate the mechanisms by which these regulators
function. Transcriptional regulators are essential in facilitating memory lymphocyte development and function in
barrier tissues. By revealing the developmental pathway of memory B cells in barrier tissues, this study will
provide important insight into how vaccines can overcome existing challenges in order to elicit broadly
protective immunity against mucosal viruses. The development of vaccines specifically designed to induce
tissue-resident memory B cells would mark an important paradigm shift away from traditional vaccination
approaches focused on inducing a systemic virus-specific B cell response."

Institute, with 25 qualifying R01 grants and 48 vision scientists in all. Vision research at Columbia ranges
across a gamut of topics, from genetic studies of retinal and visual brain development in Drosophila and mice
to studies of human retinal disease. Computational, neurophysiological, light microscopic, genetic,
biochemical, and clinical techniques focus on a range of problems including the development of the eye and
the visual brain, the mechanisms of ocular angiogenesis, the systems neuroscience of visual and oculomotor
behavior, and the pathophysiology, genetics, and treatment of retinal diseases such as macular degeneration,
retinitis pigmentosa, myopia, and glaucoma. To support this vision research, we are applying to renew our
National Eye Institute grant P30 EY019007, which will continue to support a set of Core Facilities for Vision
Research and enable services that could not be provided by individual research grants. The grant supports
three research cores: i) an Instrumentation Fabrication and Design Core that designs and builds custom
equipment; ii) a Computer Core that performs support and maintenance for the hundreds of computers,
including real-time laboratory computer-based interface used by the vision research community, handles
research-specific database design, integrated data storage, management and analysis with the new Genomics
Analysis Suite; and iii) an Imaging, Histology and Functional Diagnostics Core, which provides histological, in
vivo, fluorescent microscopy, OCT, and ERG services. The grant not only supports currently funded
investigators with NEI R01s, but also aids the work of vision scientists supported by other NEI funding
mechanisms, other NIH institutes, and, importantly, young investigators gathering data in order to submit their
first NEI grants. This grant facilitates collaboration among members of the Columbia vision research
community, and encourages scientists not currently engaged in vision research to use their expertise in
problems related to vision."
10795727,"Red blood cell (RBC) dysfunction may play a major role in VCID. The RBC expresses NOS3 (eryNOS3), a key
mediator of cerebral blood flow (CBF). Our long-term goal is to target RBC dysfunction (rheoerythrocrine) in
patients with cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and white matter (WM) damage, an unexplored area in
dementia and VCID research. We advance the provocative hypothesis that age-related RBC dysfunction
with reduced eryNOS3 and eryNO coupled with underlying endothelial dysfunction leads to reduced
CBF, WM damage and cognitive impairment. A secondary hypothesis is that this RBC dysfunction can be
targeted and ameliorated with physical exercise and chronic remote ischemic conditioning (C-RIC), an exercise
mimetic. Our Specific Aims are:
Aim 1. (Mice) Determine the contribution of the dose of eryNOS3 to WM damage, CBF, and cognitive outcomes
in the bilateral carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) model. We will utilize male, female, and aged mutant mice lacking
NOS3 in the erythroid lineage (eryNOS3-/- )
Aim 2. (Mice-Therapeutic) Determine if modulating and improving RBC dysfunction with C-RIC and/or physical
exercise will improve cognition, reduce WM damage and improved functional outcomes.
Aim 3. ( Human) Determine if C-RIC targets and improves RBC rheoerythrocrine biomarkers in human subjects
with VCID and WM disease.

11013611,"Cellular metabolism is the crux of all organismal biology. Therefore, uncovering fundamental knowledge
regarding how metabolism is controlled will have far-reaching implications. Metabolic systems are traditionally
depicted as linear or circular pathways in textbooks. In reality, these processes are intricately governed by
complex, higher-order networks of macromolecules including proteins and lipids. A metabolon is a dynamic
cluster of proteins, cofactors, and small molecules that interact to control a metabolic process. Importantly,
metabolons are found across multiple biological systems from plants to humans, indicating their fundamental
importance in biology. Heme is an essential and conserved biomolecule that is produced by the community of
proteins forming the heme metabolon. Heme not only transports oxygen in red blood cells, but it also serves as
a catalytic cofactor for proteins governing multiple cellular signaling processes across all kingdoms of life. Thus,
determining how proteins assemble and disassemble to control heme metabolon formation will provide insight
into production of this critical molecule and also form the basis for studying other key metabolons. Specifically,
we will 1) isolate and solve the structure of the heme metabolon, 2) determine dynamics of metabolon formation,
and 3) investigate how defects in specific assembly steps alter metabolic output. We will accomplish this by
integrating high-resolution cryo-EM with time-resolved proteomics and metabolomics experiments to reveal
metabolon dynamics. The combination of these approaches will unite multiple hierarchies of cellular signaling,
transforming the static textbook snapshot of metabolism into a 3D movie of a living, breathing metabolic machine.
Addressing the fundamental and unknown question of how metabolic networks are controlled via coordinated
protein organization will have major impacts in broad areas of research, including cancer progression, diabetes,
and the immune response."
11064929,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The functions of mammalian organs are maintained by the behaviors and dynamics of individual cells. The
ability to systematically map each cell type's temporal dynamics is central to the understanding of many
aspects of biological changes that mammals undergo in development. However, conventional methods are
restricted by inadequate throughput and the limited range of cellular contents that can be measured. While
single-cell genomic techniques have been developed to characterize cell state heterogeneity with high
resolution, nearly all such methods capture only a static snapshot at a single time point, with both temporal and
spatial information lost during cell isolation. Herein, the proposed projects aim to develop novel methodologies
that enable a comprehensive view of single-cell spatiotemporal dynamics across the lifespan of an entire
mammalian organism. Specifically, I will expand on the high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq platform (sci-RNA-
seq), to develop a novel method for concurrently profiling transcriptome, epigenome, and cellular temporal
dynamics (e.g., proliferation, apoptosis) in each of millions of cells. The technique will be employed to
investigate how aging regulates the status of a whole mammalian body by systematically monitoring single cell
state dynamics across a broad range of tissues in young and aged mice. This approach will be powerful
because we can not only visualize in-vivo proliferation and apoptosis behaviors of each cell type but also
dissect its connection with internal transcriptome/epigenome states. In addition to the internal molecular
programs, cell state dynamics are controlled by aspects of tissue architecture such as cell-cell interactions and
extracellular matrix abundance. To profile single cell microenvironment with high throughput and accuracy, we
will develop a novel technique called ""microtissue-seq"", for co-profiling single-cell molecular contents, cellular
spatial interactions, and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins across tens of thousands of spatial locations in a
single experiment. We will employ this technique to interrogate how cellular microenvironment regulates
organismal-scale cell state dynamics in different age groups of mice. Overall, the proposed projects will
establish a technical framework for comprehensive profiling single-cell spatiotemporal dynamics at an
unprecedented scale of a whole mammalian organism. By profiling cell-state specific dynamic behaviors
across the lifespan of mice, these technologies and experiments would uniquely enable accurate modeling of
the exquisite program underlying mammalian system maintenance and breakdown with age at single cell
resolution. These multi-pronged approaches also open a new paradigm for understanding the global molecular
programs regulating cell states and dynamics during aging, thereby informing potential pathways to delay the
aging process as well as the rational design of effective therapies to restore tissue homeostasis for patients
with aging-related diseases."
