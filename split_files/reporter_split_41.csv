10802299,"Deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) scientists are severely underrepresented in the nation’s biomedical
research workforce. In 2018 only 0.38% of all PIs on NIH awards reported a hearing disability, yet
hearing-loss prevalence for US adults ages 20-69 is 31.1%. DHH undergraduates face many barriers to
pursuing advanced research degrees, including poor mentoring, lack of DHH scientist role models, poor
self-efficacy skills, poor science identity, and community disincentives. Further, DHH people vary widely
in communication modalities, language skills, and cultural identities with respect to hearing culture. As a
result, DHH STEM students often encounter cultural stigmas and communication barriers that limit their
access to mentored undergraduate research opportunities in biomedical laboratories. The primary
mission of the proposed RIT U-RISE Scientists-in-Training Program for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing
Undergraduates (RIT U-RISE) is to diversify the biomedical research workforce by preparing 8 DHH
undergraduates annually to enter biomedically related PhD programs at research-intensive universities.
A secondary mission is to disseminate evidence-based best practices to scientists at other institutions to
make biomedical research communities-of-practice more accessible and inclusive for DHH students.
There are more than 1100 DHH students at RIT (6% of the student body). RIT institutional data shows
that DHH baccalaureate students disproportionately gravitate to non-research biomedically related
graduate programs despite persistence rates, graduation rates, and academic achievement on par with
hearing students. To counter this trend, RIT U-RISE trainees will participate in evidence-based co-
curricular enrichment and cohort building activities, specialized research ethics, safety, reproducibility,
and science writing training, and intensive mentored research training in culturally supportive labs at RIT
and research-intensive universities. Trainees will also present at national conferences. An individual
development plan (IDP) based on targeted core scientific and professional competencies will guide each
trainee’s program. Enhanced advising, monitoring, tutoring, and communication access services will
ensure trainees have the psychosocial, academic, and institutional support to succeed in entering PhD
programs. RIT U-RISE will provide cultural competency training for mentors and other faculty that fosters
institutional change. Best practices for mentoring DHH PhD-bound undergraduates will be disseminated
nationally. Fifteen RIT U-RISE trainees are expected to graduate by the end of the grant cycle and at
least 8 to enter biomedically related PhD research programs within three years of graduation. RIT has
the extensive DHH community and institutional resources, partnerships with post-graduate training
programs at research-intensive universities, and rich administrative experience and infrastructure from
the RIT-RISE program (2017-2022) to ensure the success of the RIT U-RISE program."
10814927,"Project Summary/Abstract
Circadian disruptions are strongly associated with metabolic dysfunction, yet the mechanisms by which the
circadian and metabolic systems influence one another are unclear. Elucidating the relationship between the
two systems is especially important because of the prevalence of both metabolic and circadian disruptions and
the safety and tractability of the circadian system as a therapeutic target. To address this need, the proposed
work will determine whether changes to the relative timing of the circadian oscillators in the brain, which
houses the central clock (the suprachiasmatic nucleus, or SCN) and controls feeding and metabolic rate, and
liver, which controls both glucose and fat metabolism, underlie light- and diet-induced metabolic disorders. This
work will test the hypothesis that relative timing of the brain and the liver is disrupted by aberrant light exposure
and/or maladaptive feeding, and that this relative timing is established under typical conditions by tissue-
specific period changes stemming from circadian transcriptional regulation differences. The proposed work will
test these hypotheses using mouse models of clock disruption, obesogenic diets, and altered light timing to
investigate the relative timing of the brain and liver and how that timing can be tuned. The resulting
understanding of the origin and plasticity of the endogenous relative timing between the two tissues will provide
a framework for prevention and intervention from metabolic disease with circadian etiology.
The fellowship training plan developed around the research project described above will combine skills that I
have developed during my Ph.D. studies with the expertise of the laboratory of my sponsor. Specifically, I will
take advantage of my extensive experience with circadian biology, particularly with regards to the SCN and its
influence over physiological rhythms, as well as my training in the production, maintenance, data acquisition,
and analysis of organotypic tissue cultures expressing circadian clock gene reporters. I will apply these skills to
the metabolic research questions described above by taking advantage of the expertise in the Lazar Lab in
metabolic and liver health and functional genomic techniques. The synergistic combination of my past
experience and the expertise of the Lazar Lab will thoroughly broaden and deepen my scientific and technical
skillset, which will aid me in my preparation for becoming an independent investigator. The proposed
experiments will be carried out at the world-class University of Pennsylvania, which will provide technical
support in the form of collaboration, expertise, and core facilities as well as career development support in the
form of training sessions, guidance, and networking opportunities."
10814928,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The development of additional therapies for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a pressing human health need. We
have identified epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), as potent (IC50 ~ 50-100 nM) blocker of TGFβ1 responses
ex vivo and new collagen deposition in vivo in the bleomycin model of pulmonary fibrosis. EGCG is a principal
component of green tea and has been utilized in multiple human studies. We have administered EGCG to
patients with pulmonary fibrosis for two weeks prior to undergoing lung biopsy and demonstrated highly
significant reversal of pro-fibrotic markers in lung tissue and decreases in blood biomarkers of TGFβ1
signaling. However, EGCG has not been given to patients with IPF in the setting of concurrent FDA-approved
IPF therapies and determination of the safety of EGCG in the setting of nintedanib or pirfenidone use is
essential given infrequent report of EGCG associated hepatotoxicity. The overarching goal of this proposal is
to define the safety and optimal dose of EGCG in IPF patients. We will use the R61/R33 mechanism to
conduct a robust randomized controlled Phase I trial to obtain additional critical safety and biomarker data
sufficient to empower a Phase II clinical trial to assess the efficacy of EGCG in IPF patients. A total of 5
cohorts of 10 IPF patients each at 6 clinical sites will be enrolled to receive EGCG. In Aim 1, we will determine
the safety of oral 400 mg and 600 mg EGCG given once daily to IPF patients for 12 weeks concurrent with
nintedanib or pirfenidone. We will also determine if 400 mg or 600 mg EGCG impacts nintedanib or pirfenidone
blood levels, and whether these antifibrotics alter the blood levels of EGCG. Clinical safety, especially
hepatotoxicity, will be monitored closely during the 12 week treatment duration and the 4 weeks of follow-up. In
Aim 2, we will measure the change in levels of prespecified serum biomarkers including COMP, Periostin, and
pro-MMP1 with EGCG treatment to determine if there is an in vivo signal for EGCG effect. Lastly, in Aim 3, we
will utilize the type I collagen-specific PET probe, 68Ga-CBP8 to determine the impact of EGCG in attenuating
lung accumulation. The results of Aim 2 and 3 will provide crucial information as to dose selection. This
proposal leverages the expertise of a multi-principal investigator team that are leaders in fibrosis biology and
clinical trial design, a low cost intervention, and an innovative molecular probe. The totality of this information
will provide key information needed to design a phase II with the ultimate goal of developing much needed IPF
therapies."
10915688,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) related to tobacco and alcohol consumption is aggressive and
responds poorly to available therapy. Even the new PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade is insufficient to
control progression due to other highly immunosuppressive conditions in the tumor microenvironment (TME).
Compelling evidence implicates the ecto-5'-nucleotidase (NT5E) CD73 as another important immune checkpoint,
as high CD73 expression in the TME of many tumors, including HNSC, is linked to poor patient survival.
Several consistent TME conditions, such as hypoxia and treatment, cause an increase in extracellular (e)ATP,
and CD73 serves at the last, rate-limiting step in concert with CD39 and other ectoenzymes, to convert eATP to
adenosine (eADO). eADO activates adenosine receptor (AR) A2AR to suppress T cell activation, while A2BR
promotes immunosuppression via cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) and myeloid cells present in the TME.
Studies, including our own, show that CD73 and A2BR, and to a lesser extent A2AR, are expressed in the highly
immunosuppressive TME of progressive HNSC of both clinical and preclinical samples, suggesting their role in
the immunosuppression. However, the contributions of molecules downstream of CD73 are poorly understood.
Recent rapid advances in spatial analysis of the TME have revealed a critical role of immune effector to target
cell distance in generating productive antitumor immunity with impact on clinical outcomes. Because eADO is
short-lived, the spatial relationship between CD73 on one hand and A2AR or A2BR on the other hand, is likely to
affect the specific AR activated by eADO. We discovered in HNSC clinical specimens that A2AR is rather limited
and located remotely from CD73, which supports the hypothesis that the major immunosuppressive impact of
CD73-AR immune checkpoint is mediated primarily through the CD73-A2BR axis.
Our plan is to: (1) dissect how the CD73-A2BR pathway regulates the immune landscape in the TME of ectopic
preclinical HNSC models during progression and treatment; (2) develop effective CD73-ADO-A2BR ICB regimens
in preclinical models of orthotopic and in primary carcinogen-induced tongue HNSC; (3) assess the relationships
between HNSC patient peripheral blood myeloid precursors, levels and distribution of CD73 and A2BR on myeloid
and CAF subsets in the TME, patients’ three-year post-operative outcomes.
Impact: The proposed study will identify CD73-A2BR-dependent mechanisms of immunosuppression in HNSC
preclinical models and develop translatable therapeutic intervention. The results will provide highly valuable
insights into the effects of CD73-A2BR axis on disease progression and the therapeutic potential of blocking it."

The objective of this project is to develop an innovative ring sensor system, to be worn on the finger, for the
diagnosis and monitoring of Parkinson's disease (PD) in underserved rural populations. Rural regions of the US
have been observed to be disproportionately impacted by PD due to higher rates of diagnosis, while also lacking
access to neurologists and other allied health professionals, who are overconcentrated in urban areas with
academic medical centers. As a result, rural PwPD may be diagnosed later in the disease process and have
fewer specialty care visits which leads to increased hospitalizations, morbidity and decreased quality of life. The
proposed inexpensive, easy-to-use ring can be worn daily, adjustable to any finger and used to support both
early diagnosis and ongoing symptom management. This ring could be used as a screening tool to detect PD
and alert primary care physicians (PCP) much earlier than typical. It could also be used as a tool to aid in the
remote management of PD as movement disorder specialists could use the data to assess medication timing
and management or deep brain stimulation (DBS) programming settings. The proposed system is designed with
a rural low-income user in mind. No Internet connection or smartphone/computer technology is required.
Wearable sensors for medical use in PD patients are plagued with usability concerns, many focused on the
stigma associated with wearing them in prominent locations. They also typically require a smartphone, app
and/or Internet connectivity which may limit their applicability for rural populations. There is therefore a need for
a discreet device without the need for Internet connectivity to be useful for rural PwPD. Newly available
ultraminiature high-capacity curved battery and IMU technologies make the proposed ring technically feasible at
this time."
10816389,"PROJECT SUMMARY
SARS-CoV-2 transmission was expected to have a devastating impact in sub-Saharan African countries.
Instead, morbidity and mortality rates in nearly the whole region are an order of magnitude lower than in Europe
and the Americas. To identify what is different requires a better understanding of the underlying immunological
substrate of the population, and how these factors affect susceptibility to infection, progression of symptoms,
transmission, and responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.
 These populations are assaulted by many infectious diseases, including malaria. Exposure to these
pathogens can produce long-lasting changes in the innate immune system, which may confer decreased
susceptibility to heterologous infections. By generating rapid responses to the virus, the innate immune system
can decrease the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the risk of progression from infection to disease.
On the other hand, malaria infections and helminthiasis can impair the acquisition and longevity of antibody (Ab)-
induced immunity through several mechanisms, including tolerogenic innate immune responses. In addition to
malaria, other co-morbidities, e.g., anemia and chronic undernutrition, are likely to affect Ab-mediated immunity.
 We hypothesize that malaria and helminthiasis affect morbidity of SARS-CoV-2 in sub-Saharan Africa.
Compared to Western populations, both uninfected and infected-but-asymptomatic subjects will have enhanced
innate immune phenotypes. Most infections will be asymptomatic. Once infected, though, malaria, infections with
intestinal parasites, anemia, and mild undernutrition will decrease the acquisition and longevity of Ab responses,
increasing the risk of re-infection. These comorbidities will also reduce longevity of Ab responses elicited by the
Astrazeneca vaccine. To test these hypotheses, we will enroll 200 symptomatic individuals (index cases), their
household contacts, and 300 vaccinees. We will assess the specific innate immune phenotypes that differentiate
uninfected Malawians from Western controls and whether those responses are protecting Malawians from
infection and/or progression of disease. We will follow infected participants and vaccinees for 1.5 years to assess
acquisition and longevity of Ab responses and memory B cells. The work will be supported by a platform
established on the basis of long-term collaborations with the Ministry of Health and the University of Malawi.
 As global vaccination campaigns launch, data to optimize vaccination in sub-Saharan countries are
urgently needed. Identifying groups at high risk of infection and disease and understanding the susceptibility of
the local population will help to define optimal vaccination policies to control transmission. Identifying “hypo-
responders” and those whose Ab responses wane more quickly will help to optimize vaccination regimen. In
summary, data generated by this study will improve our general understanding of SARS-CoV-2 transmission
and pathogenesis and will allow regional vaccination programs to be designed for maximum effectiveness."
10816496,"Male circumcision (MC) is a critical HIV prevention intervention with global support for expansion across sub-
Saharan Africa (SSA). MC is safe: routine programs in SSA report adverse event (AE) rates well under 2%.
Nevertheless, global MC guidelines require one or more follow-up visits within 14 days for AE detection. With
low AE rates, overstretched clinic staff waste invaluable resources conducting unnecessary routine reviews for
MC clients without complications. Men healing well needlessly pay for transport, miss work, and wait for reviews,
discouraging MC uptake. In weak healthcare systems in SSA, MC quality is buckling under pressure to provide
quality MC services and meet ambitious global targets of 5 million annual MCs. Our prior research in Zimbabwe
employed two-way texting (2wT) between patients and providers to focus follow-up on men with potential AEs,
allowing men healing without complication to opt-out of routine post-operative visits. 2wT safely reduced client
visits by 85%, suggesting that 2wT can make MC services dramatically more efficient while maintaining safety.
Whether 2wT can be replicated and scaled in other routine program settings is now a critical implementation
research question. The Republic of South Africa’s (RSA) MC context of high-volume urban clinics, remote service
delivery, and low AE identification threaten quality at scale. Across more than 500,000 annual MCs performed,
up to 1 million multi-stage, unnecessary MC reviews are likely conducted. In urban sites, this causes service
delivery bottlenecks; in rural areas, follow-up requires multiple, multi-hour trips, curtailing productivity. RSA
pressure for MC expansion and severe health system constraints, combined with good cell coverage, suggest
2wT’s impact would be significant for MC care quality and efficiency, especially in rural areas. Therefore, we
seek to develop an adaptable 2wT dissemination and implementation model at scale (2wT-2-SCALE) delivered
by routine MC teams, not research teams. First, a randomized control trial (RCT) (phase 1: test) will rigorously
evaluate how 2wT improves AE ascertainment and follow-up efficiency in urban and rural clinics. Then (phase
2: intensive), we scale (2wT-2-SCALE) via a one-year, quasi-experimental, step-wedge design with insights
gained from one additional year of 2wT with routine MC teams (phase 3: maintain). Guided by implementation
science, we employ mixed-methods to evaluate 2wT-2-SCALE’s impact on VMMC service quality. Our specific
aims are to 1) conduct an RCT to determine how 2wT increases AE ascertainment while reducing workload in
the RSA implementation context; 2) develop an effective dissemination and implementation strategy at scale
(2WT-2-SCALE) using RE-AIM to evaluate program reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and
maintenance; and 3) use activity based micro-costing to estimate the payer-perspective budget and program
impact from 2wT scale-up compared to routine care. This implementation research is feasible, highly innovative
and systems-focused, establishing local evidence and timely, real-world data to support further adaptation,
adoption, and spread of 2wT to improve efficient, safe, high-quality MC services at scale in RSA and beyond."
10816499,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is often described as a ‘prototypic’ receptor tyrosine kinase
(RTK). As one of the first single transmembrane domain receptors for which ligand-induced dimerization was
reported, the ‘traditional’ view of EGFR (and other RTKs) has been of a binary ‘off’/‘on’ switch. Our previous
work, together with recent work on similar receptors, instead argues that signaling by receptors of this type is
much more ‘graded’ – and that EGFR and other receptors can discriminate between different ligands. Indeed,
we showed that different EGFR-activating ligands can induce receptor dimers with distinct structures – leading
to different signaling kinetics and orthogonal cellular outcomes. Remarkably, the key residues that define the
differences between the structures of these dimers coincide with the hotspots for extracellular EGFR mutations
in glioblastoma. We therefore hypothesize here that EGFR mutations in GBM may exert at least part of their
effect by altering the nature of the signaling response to different EGFR ligands. This would open the
possibility of ‘correcting’ EGFR signaling in cancer if antibodies or other agents could be developed to
reprogram them as ‘allosteric microprocessors’ by analogy with biased agonists for G-protein coupled
receptors.
 Primary resistance to EGFR inhibitors in glioblastoma and in lung cancer is an important clinical problem
that limits success with existing EGFR-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Static structural views of
kinase domains have not allowed satisfying explanations for the relative abilities of TKIs to inhibit different
variants – leaving the origins of primary resistance and of mutant selectivity (e.g. of osimertinib) unclear and
difficult to solve. New instances of acquired TKI resistance suffer from the same problem. Our studies using
hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) alongside enzymology suggest that the key may
lie in the effects of both the mutations and the TKIs themselves on structural dynamics – particularly in the
case of 3rd generation covalent EGFR inhibitors that associate with their targets in multiple steps.
 With this background, the key overall goal of this proposal is to identify specific behavior of EGFR variants
seen in cancer that can explain their altered signaling properties and altered sensitivity to inhibitors. We apply
a range of biophysical, structural, biochemical, and cellular approaches to interrogate signaling at several
levels of resolution. In addition to answering key mechanistic questions for EGFR, our results should illuminate
potential new avenues for therapeutic intervention. Our Specific Aims ask the following questions:
1 How do disease-associated extracellular mutations in EGFR family members affect signaling specificity
 and kinetics?
2 Can structural dynamics explain primary kinase inhibitor resistance of exon 19 EGFR variants in lung
 cancer, and selectivity of 3rd generation covalent inhibitors?"
10816393,"Currently, almost all molecular biomarker studies in Alzheimer disease (AD) and clinical trials on AD have been
largely limited to Caucasian participants. The fundamental question is whether AD, as currently defined, is the
same disease for African Americans, the largest under-represented group (URG) in the US, and Caucasians,
both in the preclinical and symptomatic stages. Conflicting results have thus far appeared in the literature about
this very question, largely due to the limited sample sizes of African Americans in published studies. We propose
to tackle these problems by implementing a multi-center and longitudinal study with a central and standardized
re-processing of all currently existing and prospectively collected cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples, magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) structural scans, and positron emission tomography (PET) beta-amyloid and PET tau
imaging scans, in addition to a harmonization of clinical and cognitive outcomes. We will join forces with five
major biomarker studies of AD: the Washington University Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (ADRC),
University of Pennsylvania AD Core Center, Emory University ADRC, Harvard Aging Brain Study, and the Anti-
Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's trial. We will assemble likely the largest biomarker data set of
African Americans, and analyze resulting AD biomarker and cognitive data in a comprehensive manner to
examine the racial disparity in both the preclinical and the symptomatic stages. We will further assess the roles
that AD risk factors, APOE ε4 status, family history, age, sex, education, socioeconomic status, and vascular
burden play in cross sectional and longitudinal differences between African Americans and Caucasians. We will
also determine the racial differences in the predictability of AD biomarkers to concurrent and longitudinal
cognitive outcomes. These racial differences, if confirmed by the proposed study on the largest African
Americans biomarker cohort, may imply potentially differential treatment responses between the races, and
hence will have profound implications to the design and analyses of ongoing and future prevention and treatment
trials of AD."
10797517,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) continues to have a dismal 5-year survival rate of <25% with chemotherapy.
In addition, those who survive suffer lifelong consequences, due to complications from chemotherapy using non-
targeted cytotoxic drugs such as cytarabine and anthracycline. Thus, there is an urgent need to discover and
develop novel and targeted drugs that are more effective and less toxic to improve the treatment for AML. Studies
have found that the human MDM2 oncogene is frequently overexpressed in AML, and high levels of MDM2
expression is associated with disease progression and poor treatment outcome. It is known that one of the
oncogenic functions of MDM2 is to bind to the tumor suppressor p53, which inhibits p53-mediated transactivation
in the nucleus leading to cancer promotion. MDM2 also plays p53-independent roles in oncogenesis by
interacting with and regulating other molecules. For instance, MDM2 interacts with and regulates α/β tubulins in
the cytoplasm, which may play a p53-independent role in oncogenesis. This notion is derived from our
observations that a novel tubulin inhibitor termed VERU-111 can specifically and strongly inhibit MDM2
expression without associated activation of p53. Significantly, we have found that AML-cell death induced by
VERU-111 is correlated with the expression level of MDM2 in AML cells: leukemic cells with high-levels of MDM2
expression are very sensitive to VERU-111 with a IC50 value of 2.5~5 nM, whereas MDM2-negative AML cells
are resistant, regardless of their p53 status (wild type or mutant p53). Based on these observations, we
hypothesize that an important p53-independent oncogenic role of MDM2 is regulation of the microtubule network
through its interaction with tubulins, leading to altered microtubule dynamics and carcinogenesis. We further
hypothesize that VERU-111 blocks MDM2-tubulin interaction by binding to the colchicine site within the α/β
tubulin interface, leading to downregulation of MDM2 via increased ubiquitination and cancer cell death. The
goal of this proposal is to use VERU-111 as a probe and AML as cell model to test our hypothesis and perform
preclinical studies to validate that targeting the MDM2-microtubule signaling pathway by VERU-111 is a novel
and attractive therapeutic strategy in MDM2-expressing AML. Specifically, we will elucidate the p53-independent
role of MDM2 in interacting with and regulating α/β tubulins for AML cell growth and disease progression (Aim
1). We will determine whether the MDM2-α/β tubulin interaction is a target of VERU-111 (Aim 2). Additionally,
we will investigate the feasibility of targeting the MDM2-α/β tubulin signaling pathway by VERU-111 for precision
and personalized treatment of refractory/MDM2-overexpressing AML (Aim 3). Since VERU-111 is well developed
with oral availability, excellent PK properties and minimal toxicity; it has also passed extensive IND-enabling
studies and is currently as a tubulin inhibitor in Phase 3 clinical trials for metastatic prostate cancer, knowledge
generated from the proposed study should have near-term clinical impact by providing a rationale for expedited
initiation of VERU-111 in an AML Phase-1 clinical trial."
10925425,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Beta cell dysfunction and death are significant pathologies underlying the development of Type 2 diabetes.
There is both clinical and molecular evidence that the pathogenesis of COVID19 may have acute and specific
effects on pancreatic beta cell function. One of the barriers to understanding how SARS-CoV2 infection may
affect beta cell function and survival in patients is the limited number of physiologically relevant animal models
to study. We have capitalized on unique access the pancreas of SCV2-innoculated animals to model and
understand how SARS-CoV2 infection affects beta cell survival, metabolism, and function. There is controversy
in the literature regarding if SARS-COV2 directly infects beta cells and affects beta cell function and survival or
if the disruption of glucose homeostasis in patients is secondary. We hypothesize that SARS-CoV2 infection
directly and acutely compromises beta cell function and survival by reprogramming cellular metabolism,
thus leaving hosts susceptible to diabetes during or after infection. These highly innovative experiments
capitalize on a unique and clinically relevant model system and employs cutting edge techniques to assess how
beta cell survival and metabolism are affected by SARS-CoV2 infection. These experiments will provide critical
mechanistic insight to the underpinnings of the emerging clinical phenotype of acute hyperglycemia, diabetic
ketoacidosis, and potentially lifelong diabetes that may afflict a significant number of patients who have
recovered from COVID19. The objective of this proposal is to protect the PI’s time to provide culturally-aware
mentoring and intensive training to graduate students from historically underrepresented backgrounds
participating in this innovative research program. This objective dovetails with the PI’s immediate and long terms
goals, which are to: (1) establish MERCH-LA (Mentoring Emerging Researchers at Children’s Hospital Los
Angeles) as a fundamental part of the educational and research infrastructure at CHLA and (2) longitudinally
track and quantify outcomes for MERCH-LA graduates into bioscience-related post-graduate careers."
10816396,"ABSTRACT
Toddler milk (i.e., an ultra-processed milk-based drink marketed to toddlers) is increasing in popularity in the US
and globally. However, toddler milk is not recommended by medical and pediatric associations, because it
usually contains added sugar, and early consumption of added sugar is associated with obesity and type 2
diabetes. Toddler milk packaging contains front-of-package (FOP) claims marketing the supposed “benefits” of
the product. Such marketing claims are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and may
mislead parents about the healthfulness of toddler milk. There is a significant gap in understanding how
marketing elements on toddler milk packaging influence parents' perceptions of and beliefs about the product.
This gap represents a critical public health problem because understanding how marketing claims on toddler
milk packages affect parents is necessary to inform labeling policy and prevent parents from exposure to
information that is not supported by science. This project examines how toddler milk marketing influences
parental perceptions and beliefs via a systematic review, packaging content analysis, and focus groups with
parents. Using primary and secondary data, this study aims to: 1) Describe the determinants of toddler milk
purchasing and the influence of marketing on parents’ beliefs and behavior by conducting a systematic review.
Under this aim, the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA) Statement will be used, and the existing literature around toddler milk labeling will be synthesized; 2)
Describe the nutritional qualities and FOP marketing claims of the top 5 toddler milk brands in the United States
and 22 Latin American countries by conducting a content analysis of toddler milk FOP labels. This aim will
elucidate and quantify food companies' labeling marketing practices around toddler milk; and 3) Explore how
marketing exposure, including reactions to FOP claims and warnings, influences parents' perceptions, beliefs,
and use of toddler milk. Focus groups with parents of toddlers will provide in-depth knowledge about how and
why the marketing practices identified in Aim 2 affect parents' perceptions and beliefs. The overall training
objectives are to develop a theoretical understanding of how marketing practices influence consumers'
perceptions and beliefs while developing skills to conduct systematic reviews, content analysis, and focus group
data analysis. The proposed research fits with NICHD's mission of “enhancing the lives of children,” and is timely
and significant because it will generate both an understanding of how food labeling influences parents and
evidence to support food labeling policy change. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to inform the FDA
so that it can regulate toddler milk packaging and protect parents from feeding their children an unhealthy product
during a crucial phase of development."
10816531,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Dysregulation of dopamine (DA) signaling is thought to underlie the neural deficits of serious mental illness (SMI),
including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression. Treatment for SMI relies on second generation
antipsychotics (SGAs), which bind with high affinity to the DA D2-like family of inhibitory Gi/o trimeric G protein
coupled receptors, thereby impairing the ability of DA receptors to signal to G protein in response to DA. While
the primary target of SGAs was thought to be the D2 DA receptor (D2R), in-vitro binding assays have
demonstrated equal or even higher affinity of these drugs for the D3 DA receptor (D3R), which is known to be
localized in neural loci associated with affect. Recently, we found that D3Rs in the axon initial segment (AIS) of
midbrain and prefrontal cortex modulate cellular excitability via an Arrestin-mediated, ERK1/2 dependent
interaction with T-type Ca2+ channels (CaV3.2), as opposed to canonical Gi-mediated Ca2+ channel inhibition.
This is particularly intriguing as DA binding to D3R does not promote Arrestin recruitment except, as we have
found, with concomitant activation of protein kinase C (PKC) via second messengers and/or depolarization.
Furthermore, we have found that some SGAs engage this Arrestin-specific signaling mechanism even in the
absence of G protein activation. I hypothesize that ligand binding and PKC activation promote independent
phosphorylation events on the D3R, both of which are required for Arrestin engagement and channel modulation.
Here, I will examine the molecular determinants of the neuromodulatory interaction between the D3R and CaV3.2.
I will determine the ligand-dependent and PKC-dependent kinase phosphorylation sites on the D3R that are
integral to this functional interaction using site-directed mutagenesis. I will create heterologous cell lines stably
expressing these mutant receptors and examine their impact on D3R Ca2+ modulation using in vitro whole cell
patch clamp electrophysiology in this heterologous system. I will also examine the ability of a panel of SGAs to
recruit Arrestin and modulate channel function. Lastly, I will examine which SGA ligands, as a consequence of
Arrestin engagement, promote D3R endocytosis and degradation upon prolonged drug administration, and
whether this differential trafficking can account for the variable cognitive side-effects commonly observed in
patient populations, using in vivo mouse behavioral models. I hypothesize that while all SGAs antagonize G
protein signaling, only some will engage Arrestin supporting acute inhibition of CaV3.2 in the AIS while others
will not. By extension, I also hypothesize that the select ligands that engage Arrestin will promote D3R
downregulation during repeated SGA administration while those that do not will promote D3R upregulation by
preventing DA-mediated endocytosis and degradation. My goal is to better characterize SGAs for their D3R
Arrestin-mediated signaling and trafficking, and thereby provide insight into the effect/side-effect profiles of SGAs
and perhaps guide the development of next generation treatments for SMI."

introduced, as well as explore (7) two new BAHA-promoted single-electron oxidative coupling reactions that we
have discovered since the grant was last reviewed. The studies target antitumor compounds that act through
selective protein (e.g., tubulin) or sequence selective DNA binding and provide well-defined challenges for the
design, synthesis, and evaluation of synthetic, mechanism-based analogs in which the structural features
responsible for their target binding affinity, selectivity, and functional reactivity will be identified, addressed,
optimized, and exploited. Efforts will provide synthetic vinblastine analogs that clarify their interaction with their
biological target, help delineate their mechanism of action, and address clinical limitations of the natural product
drug. Studies have provided synthetic vinblastine analogs now available in 3-steps from commercial materials
that are as much as 100-fold more potent than the natural product and/or that directly overcome the basis of
clinical resistance derived from Pgp overexpression and drug efflux (aka MDR). Analogs with improved potency,
selectivity, and/or such improved tumor resistance profiles can be expected to emerge from the studies that
could provide the basis for transformative new oncology drugs, representing compounds that not only could
serve as vinblastine replacements in clinic, but also offer new and effective treatment options in instances of
other multidrug resistant tumors (overexpression of Pgp) refractory to nearly all other front-line drugs."

 Subthalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease (PD) can be highly
effective at improving motor symptoms and enhancing the patient’s quality of life. However, DBS surgical
targeting technology and post-operative programming practices have been relatively stagnant over the ~20
year history of the therapy. Nonetheless, substantial scientific advances have been made in MRI acquisition
protocols, patient-specific DBS modeling methods, and 3D visualization technologies. Therefore, the goal of
this Bioengineering Research Grant (PAR-19-159) is to apply the latest advances in MR imaging, DBS
modeling, and holographic visualization to the clinical practice of subthalamic DBS for PD.
 The first step of this project is to apply the scientific advances of quantitative MRI to the clinical problem of
subthalamic nucleus (STN) identification in patients with PD. Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) is a
completely new approach to MR acquisition, reconstruction, and post processing. Our group has used MRF to
simultaneously acquire quantitative maps of T1, T2, and T2* in a single, inherently co-registered, whole-brain
3D acquisition, with 0.6 mm3 image resolution, lasting only ~15 min. The key advantage of multi-dimensional
MRF data is that provides the best possible information for performing volumetric segmentation of the STN.
 The second step of this project is to take the patient-specific MRF data, with our STN segmentations, and
integrate them with the coordinate system of the stereotactic frame via holographic visualization for the
neurosurgeon. Our group developed the first fully functional neurosurgical navigation system within the
Microsoft HoloLens visualization platform and this system is directly compatible with the Leksell stereotactic
frame. This study will apply that tool we call HoloDBS to the creation of the pre-operative surgical plan for our
research subjects.
 The third step of this project is to take the patient-specific holographic model of DBS and put it into the
hands of the programming neurologist. Modern DBS devices consist of electrodes with 8 contacts and a
nearly infinite parameter space of stimulus amplitudes, pulse durations, and frequencies. This study will
provide our patient-specific DBS models, which also run within the HoloLens platform, to the neurologist who
can then use holographic visualization to help customize the treatment to patient."

Considerable efforts have been spent in the past two decades to search for biomarkers for pre-symptomatic
stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). For neuroimaging, amyloid-PET imaging of amyloid beta (Aβ) accumulation
in the brain is considered an early marker for the preclinical stage of AD, while tau-PET imaging correlates more
closely with neuronal injury and cognitive decline. However, PET scans are expensive and involve radioactive
tracers. Resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) studies in AD have shown that the functional connectivity (FC) of resting
brain networks is progressively diminished in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. However,
FC analysis of rs-fMRI has limited capability to characterize the dynamic fluctuations of rs-fMRI signals that
possess clinically meaningful information. Our group and others have recently explored the use of entropy
measures as indices of the complexity and regularity of rs-fMRI time-series. Accumulating data showed
decreasing entropy values associated with aging, APOE ɛ4 genotype, cognitive decline in autosomal dominant
Alzheimer's disease (ADAD) and late-onset AD (LOAD). Our group began developing the Complexity Toolbox
in 2013 as the first systematic and comprehensive software package dedicated to complexity analysis of
neuroimaging (fMRI) data. In particular, a recent independent study using our toolbox to analyze the rs-fMRI
data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study reported progressive reductions of
entropy from healthy controls, early MRI, to late MCI and AD groups, with significant associations between
complexity measures of rs-fMRI and cognitive decline in MCI/AD subjects. Our preliminary data in ADAD and
LOAD subjects further showed consistent negative correlations between rs-fMRI entropy and tau-PET signal.
The goal of this project is to further develop our Complexity Toolbox and a cloud-based pipeline for
comprehensive complexity analysis of (large scale) fMRI data. We will systematically evaluate the complexity of
fMRI as a novel imaging marker of AD in both ADAD and LOAD populations, using 3 public databases of rs-
fMRI and PET including Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN), Connectome of ADAD, and the
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-3) with a total sample size >900. Finally, we will use
advanced machine learning techniques to evaluate complexity of rs-fMRI as a predictor for transversion from
healthy to MCI and to AD. We will generate a disease staging model based on multimodal AD biomarkers
including PET, CSF and rs-fMRI measures. We hypothesize that the complexity of BOLD signals provides an
index of the information processing capacity of regional neuron populations, and is therefore sensitive to tau-
related neuronal injury and cognitive decline in the AD processes. The successful completion of this project will
lead to a noninvasive, economical and alternative imaging biomarker of neuronal injury in MCI and AD with
relevant tools ready to be deployed in clinical research and care of AD."

 A significant percentage of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH) exhibit HIV associated neurocognitive
disorders (HAND). With the development and improvement of combination antiretroviral therapies (cART) there
was a substantial decrease of the death and morbidity rates of PLWH. HAND and neuroinflammation are
exacerbated by Methamphetamine (Meth) abuse. PLWH abusing Meth present a high prevalence of chronic
neuroinflammation and the cellular mechanism(s) that drive such inflammation have not been entirely defined.
 Certain models of neuroinflammation define inter-cellular cytokine signaling as a major player in
neuroinflammation. These models propose that activation of microglia results in the production of inflammatory
cytokines and metabolites that are recognized by astrocytes, leading to a modification from non-reactive
astrocytes to a range of pro-inflammatory or repair phenotypes. In this proposal we aim to identify the molecular
mechanisms that trigger the activation of intracellular innate immunity in microglia and astrocytes in the context
of NeuroHIV and Meth, and characterize the cellular crosstalk between HIV infected and non-infected brain cells
under physiological concentrations of cART.
 Our preliminary data from gene expression and microscopy of innate sensing immune complexes points to
an activation of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)/stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway in
microglia with Meth and HIV infection. Thus, we hypothesize that HIV-triggered activation of the cGAS/STING
pathway leads to episodes of chronic neuroinflamation. We also hypothesize that Meth-mediated DNA damage
is additive to the activation of the inflammation pathway. In the R61 phase, we aim to determine the impact of
HIV post-entry events and Meth-mediated DNA damage on innate immune sensing of glial cells. During the R33
phase, we will characterize the biological consequences of HIV/Meth-mediated innate sensing to brain organoids
under brain physiologic cART concentrations. We aim to assess the potential of cGAS/STING antagonists to
reduce neuroinflammation in the context of HIV/Meth. We will carry out an experimental plan using functional
assays, cyclic multiplex immunofluorescence and super-resolution fluorescence imaging, machine learning
analysis, next-generation sequencing, and multiplexed cytokine profiling in iPSC-derived microglia, astrocytes,
cerebral brain organoids and a chimeric human/mouse animal model.
 These studies will define the activation of HIV/Meth-mediated innate immunity in cells from the brain that are
known to be infected by HIV and the impact of this activation in the disruption of normal brain homeostasis by
inflammatory processes. At the heart of this proposal is the clarification and identification of the
mechanism(s) that drive and/or contribute to persistent neuroinflammation by HIV and Meth under cART
that culminate in HAND. Knowledge gained from this research plan can inform therapeutic potential to
ameliorate and/or reduce HAND in PLWH."

Adults with traumatic brain injury (TBI) have deficits in flexible and goal-directed behavior and these
impairments have been linked to negative outcomes and poor community reintegration and independence. The
frontal lobes, and their putative functions of executive control and working memory, have figured prominently,
and nearly exclusively, in mechanistic accounts of flexible and adaptive behavior and in understanding the
underlying nature of behavioral dysfunction in individuals with TBI. Yet, interventions designed to target the
frontal lobes have not yielded significant improvements in behavior or independence in the community. We
propose that the frontal lobes may be the wrong, or not the only, mechanism of impairment leading to inflexible
and maladaptive behavior in TBI. We aim to show that flexible and goal-directed behavior depends critically on
the operation of the hippocampal relational memory system and is a key mechanism in the observed
behavioral dysfunction and poor outcomes in individuals with TBI. The proposed program of research
represents a novel direction in the study of traumatic brain injury with substantial basic science and clinical
translational significance. The proposal is organized around four AIMS: (1) To characterize disruptions in the
integrity of the structure of the hippocampal system and their impact on relational memory in individuals with
traumatic brain injury. (2) To characterize the impact of relational memory impairments on flexible and goal-
directed behavior in individuals with traumatic brain injury. (3) To investigate the impact of disruption of the
hippocampal system and relational memory on the larger network of structures participating in flexible and
goal-directed behavior in individuals with traumatic brain injury. (4) To determine the relationship between
impairment in relational memory and community integration and independence in individuals with traumatic
brain injury. This proposal is unique in the field and uniquely promising for understanding the nature of
behavioral dysfunction in TBI and, ultimately, improving rehabilitation intervention outcomes. Indeed, the
proposed work lays the critical foundation for the identification of objective and diagnostic biomarkers for
behavioral dysfunction following TBI and for the development of new rehabilitative targets. Linking behavioral
dysfunction in TBI to the hippocampal relational memory system will also inform the characterization of a
number of other neurological (e.g., stroke, TBI, Alzheimer's disease), psychiatric (e.g., schizophrenia,
depression), and developmental (e.g., autism) conditions that affect hippocampal relational memory and where
deficits in flexible and goal-directed behavior are also hallmark."

Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) is the largest long-term study of brain development and child
health in the United States. The ABCD Research Consortium consists of 21 research sites across the country,
a Coordinating Center, and a Data Analysis and Informatics Resource Center. In its first five years, under
RFA-DA-15-015, ABCD enrolled a diverse sample of 11,878 9-10 year olds from across the consortium, and
will track their biological and behavioral development through adolescence into young adulthood.
All participants received a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging,
neuropsychological testing, bioassays, careful assessment of substance use, mental health, physical health,
and culture and environment. A similar detailed assessment recurs every 2 years. Interim in-person annual
interviews and mid-year telephone or mobile app assessments provide refined temporal resolution of
developmental changes and life events that occur over time with minimal burden to participating youth and
parents. Intensive efforts are made to keep the vast majority of participants involved with the study through
adolescence and beyond, and retention rates thus far are very high. Neuroimaging has expanded our
understanding of brain development from childhood into adulthood. Using this and other cutting-edge
technologies, ABCD can determine how different kinds of youth experiences (such as sports, school
involvement, extracurricular activities, videogames, social media, unhealthy sleep patterns, and vaping)
interact with each other and with a child’s changing biology to affect brain development and social, behavioral,
academic, health, and other outcomes.
Data, securely and privately shared with the scientific community, will enable investigators to: (1) describe
individual developmental pathways in terms of neural, cognitive, emotional, and academic functioning, and
influencing factors; (2) develop national standards of healthy brain development; (3) investigate the roles and
interaction of genes and the environment on development; (4) examine how physical activity, sleep, screen
time, sports injuries (including traumatic brain injuries), and other experiences influence brain development; (5)
determine and replicate factors that influence mental health from childhood to young adulthood; (6)
characterize relationships between mental health and substance use; and (7) specify how use of substances
such as cannabis, alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine affects developmental outcomes, and how neural, cognitive,
emotional, and environmental factors influence the risk for adolescent substance use."
10816424,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Fibrosis is the accumulation of extracellular matrix components that disrupt tissue function and is prevalent
across many muscle diseases. Muscle functions compromised in fibrosis include muscles primary function to
contract as well as its ability to be compliantly stretched when not active. This results in weak and stiff muscle
decreasing mobility and producing joint contractures. Skeletal muscle regenerates following injury from resident
muscle stem cells, however those cells are sensitive to the organization and mechanics of fibrotic extracellular
matrix. Another muscle resident stem cell, fibro-adipogenic progenitors, support myogenesis following injury, but
in the context of fibrosis contribute to the pathologic buildup of extracellular matrix. However, the sensitivity of
fibro-adipogenic progenitors to their mechanical environment is unknown. Nor is it known how fibro-adipogenic
progenitors production of extracellular matrix signals to muscle stem cells to support or impair myogenesis. In
order to target effective anti-fbrotic therapies the mechanisms that of communication between fibro-adipogenic
progenitors and the extracellular matrix that defines fibrosis must be revealed. Further, the fibrotic environment
can act as a barrier to restorative gene therapies for muscular dystrophy, but how fibrosis may influence the
efficacy of promising gene therapies is unknown.
Fibrosis is particularly common in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, with associated joint contractures. Yet, even
removal of functional dystrophin from more fibrotic mouse strains yields a less severe fibrosis, motivating a
conjunction of studies in both mice and humans. Fibro-adipogenic progenitors can be activated into pro-
fibrogenic cells to resist apoptotic signals and produce excessive extracellular matrix components. This fibrotic
extracellular matrix is mainly made of fibrillar collagen, which is the dominant load-bearing structure within
healthy and fibrotic extracellular matrix. However, the organization of collagen fibers in the extracellular matrix
can alter both the mechanics and adherent cell phenotypes. Fibro-adipogenic progenitors are similar to
mesenchymal stromal cells, yet how extracellular matrix organization and mechanical signals drive conversion
to the pro-fibrotic state are not known. Nor is it known how one of the primary functions of fibro-adipogenic
progenitors, to secrete extracellular matrix, impacts the muscle stem cells responsible for myogenesis. This the
potential to create a positive feedback cycle between fibro-adipogenic protenitors and the extracellular matrix.
Promising gene therapy using micro-dystrophin is able to largely restore the integrity of myofibers. However, it
isn’t known if once the pro-fibrotic cycle is in place if restoring the myofiber integrity and the initiating signals of
fibrosis will be sufficient to reverse prominent fibrosis and the associated decline in function. Thus, our objective
is to reveal fibro-adipogenic progenitors-based extracellular matrix contribution to functional decline and lack of
regeneration in fibrosis along with the potential to reverse fibrosis in muscular dystrophy.
In Aim 1, we will utilize a combination of engineered gels and native decellularized matrices to mimic health and
fibrosis to determine both the architectural and mechanical features of a cell substrate that directs fibro-
adipogenic progenitor fate. In Aim 2, we will induce pro-fibrotic or pro-regenerative fibro-adipogenic progenitor
synthesis of extracellular matrices to determine how their structure influences muscle stem cell myogenesis in
fibrosis. In Aim 3, micro-dystrophin gene therapy will be administered to before and after the onset of fibrosis to
stratify the functional efficacy and change in fibrosis based on the initial stage of fibro-adipogenic progenitors
and fibrosis. Success in these Aims will establish the mechanisms fibro-adipogenic progenitors and extracellular
matrix interact to perpetuate progressive fibrosis and identify specific targets for anti-fibrotic therapy development
that can restore function and enhance the efficacy of restorative gene therapy in muscular dystrophies."
10816427,"Our lack of understanding regarding how vitamin D regulates glucose prevents its use as an effective diabetes
therapy. We have shown that vitamin D can act in the brain to lower glucose levels and that loss of vitamin D
receptors (VDR) within the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) of the brain are critical for normal glucose
levels in obese, but not lean, animals. However, the neurocircuitry/function of VDRPVH neurons, the role of the
PVH VDR responding to dietary vitamin D, and mechanisms underlying effects in obese but not lean states are
unknown. This raises basic questions regarding how vitamin D receptors mediate glucose balance. We have
generated a genetic mouse model with Cre recombinase expression in VDR positive cells (VDRCre). This
provides an excellent model to determine the function, necessity, and downstream neuronal targets of VDRPVH
neurons. Additionally, utilizing other genetic tools, we can determine if VDR within the PVH are necessary for
changes in blood glucose by dietary vitamin D. Last, we can utilize these tools to determine the mechanisms
underlying weight-specific effects of vitamin D in the brain on glucose regulation. The objective of this grant is
to determine the mechanisms of vitamin D in the brain on glucose balance. We hypothesize that VDR regulate
glucose levels through distinct neuronal circuits and through genomic effects in PVH neurons. The central
hypothesis will be tested by three specific aims: 1) identifying neuronal mechanisms for PVH VDR positive
neurons; 2) determining if PVH VDR are required or sufficient for dietary-vitamin D changes in glucose
homeostasis; and 3) establishing mechanisms for the glucose-protective effect of vitamin D in an obese model.
In Aim 1, we will use chemogenetics, single-cell genomics, and immunohistochemistry to determine the
function, identity, and circuitry of VDRPVH neurons. In Aim 2, we will use different dietary manipulations of
vitamin D to test if PVH VDR are necessary for high-vitamin D induced glucose improvements. Additionally,
we will determine if central administration of active vitamin D can overcome deleterious effects of low dietary
vitamin D on glucose balance. In Aim 3, we will determine how obesity alters the transcriptomic and neuronal
activation response to active vitamin D (1,25D3). Additionally, we will determine if there are differences in VDR
expression or VDR+ neuronal number in obese vs. lean states. The research proposed is innovative, because
it investigates the function of a novel neuronal population (VDRPVH) on glucose tolerance, using a novel mouse
model. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to identify new paradigms to understand
vitamin D action, as well as possibly identifying a novel circuit in the PVH with critical glucose-regulating
properties. Results from this research may ultimately explain some of the variance in clinical trials utilizing
vitamin D as a therapy and provide critical information to advance the use of vitamin D as a therapeutic agent.
Altogether, I envision that the completion of this proposal will move this research towards the long-term goal of
understanding how to utilize vitamin D as an effective therapy for type 2 diabetes."

This proposal focuses on titin, the largest protein known, in heart function and disease. Titin forms a novel and
multifunctional myofilament in the striated-muscle sarcomere with important roles that include regulating the
diastolic stiffness of the heart. Recent breakthrough studies revealed that titin is of high clinical importance in
both heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction
(HFrEF). Although significant progress has been made in understanding the basic biology of titin, major gaps in
our understanding still remain, including a mechanistic understanding of how titin causes/contributes to heart
disease. An important focus of this proposal will be on titin’s role in diastolic dysfunction, motivated by recent
studies on patients with HFpEF that revealed deranged phosphorylation of titin’s molecular spring elements and
diastolic stiffening. The full spectrum of posttranslational modifications that occur in HFpEF will be studied and
high-resolution time-resolved spectroscopic techniques will focus on uncovering the structural changes in titin’s
spring elements triggered by posttranslational modification. Drug screens will focus on identifying compounds
that mimic or block these structural changes and functional studies will test whether newly discovered and
candidate drugs ameliorate titin-based diastolic stiffening in HFpEF. Post-transcriptional mechanisms will be
investigated as well, taking advantage of our recent work that has shown that splicing of titin can be manipulated
to upregulate complaint titin isoforms and restore diastolic function. The functional efficacy of identified
compounds will be tested on engineered heart tissues as well as on animal models. The second major focus of
this proposal will be on titin in HFrEF. Several recent sequencing studies in large groups of patients revealed
that mutations in the titin gene (TTN) are causative in ~20% of studied dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients.
Many of the mutations are truncation mutations (TTNtv) and they have a preferential location in the A-band
segment of titin. The A-band segment is the least well-studied part of titin and an important goal of our research
is to critically examine the biology of titin in this region of the sarcomere where disease-causing mutations are
prominent. These studies include a focus on the role of titin in interacting with cMyBP-C (cardiac myosin-binding
protein C, a clinically important thick filament protein). Animal models will be investigated in which TTNtv have
been introduced in different regions of titin’s A-band segment. The effects of the mutations will be studied under
baseline conditions, when stressed, and when occurring in combination with mutations in other genes.
Importantly, we will also test whether excision of the mutated titin exons ameliorates titin-based DCM. In
summary, capitalizing on my >20-year track record of innovative titin research, and utilizing our team of
experienced scientists and talented trainees, this proposal sets ambitious goals that are expected to further
accelerate understanding of the biology of titin, its role in heart disease and titin’s potential to function as a
therapeutic target."

Keratinocytes and melanocytes together form the epidermal melanin unit, which is essential for the protective
tanning response after ultraviolet radiation (UV) exposure. Keratinocytes respond to UV by releasing paracrine
factors that induce melanocytes to increase melanin production and dendricity. My lab showed that the
keratinocyte-specific desmosomal cadherin, desmoglein 1 (Dsg1), which is temporarily lost in response to acute
UV exposure, plays a role in this protective tanning response. Acute exposure of melanocytes to conditioned
media from Dsg1-deficient keratinocytes increase melanin secretion and dendricity. However, melanocytes
chronically exposed to Dsg1-deficient keratinocytes exhibited features of transformation, including pagetoid
melanocytosis. We found recently that melanoma cells in conditioned media from Dsg1-deficient keratinocytes
exhibited increased migration, due at least in part to CXCL1/CXCR2 signaling. When keratinocytes were cultured
in melanoma conditioned media, Dsg1 was downregulated along with its transcriptional activator Grainyhead
like 1 (Grhl1), while in sections from patient melanoma tissues, Dsg1 was lost in keratinocytes surrounding
melanomas. Overall, these data lead me to hypothesize that melanoma cells actively target Dsg1 for
downregulation in keratinocytes for their own benefit, leading to increased production of paracrine factors that in
turn promote melanoma progression. Our RNA sequencing results suggest that melanoma cells cultured in
Dsg1-deficient media upregulate a neural crest stem cell (NCSC)-like signature, exhibited by a melanoma cell
population with enhanced migration, invasion and drug resistance. Here, I propose to 1) determine how loss of
keratinocyte Dsg1 leads to the reprogramming of melanoma cells to adopt more pro-tumorigenic cell fates, and
2) determine how melanoma cells downregulate keratinocyte Dsg1 by elucidating the upstream regulators that
modulate Dsg1 expression and the mechanisms by which melanoma cells target Dsg1 in keratinocytes. Toward
this end, I will culture melanoma cells in Dsg1-deficient keratinocyte conditioned media and use RNA sequencing
and single molecule RNA FISH to identify changes in transcriptional signatures between migratory/non-migratory
and invasive/non-invasive melanoma cell populations. To determine if melanoma cells adjacent to keratinocytes
that lack Dsg1 exhibit an increase in NCSC-like markers, I will use human tissue sections and stain for NCSC-
like markers. To identify the melanoma secreted factors that can inhibit Dsg1 in keratinocytes, I will take a parallel
candidate and unbiased approach, focusing on growth factors that can activate Erk5, which was identified as an
upstream regulator of Dsg1 by RNA sequencing. Factors that alter Dsg1 expression in keratinocytes will be
genetically manipulated in melanoma cells and resulting conditioned media collected. Keratinocytes will be
cultured in melanoma conditioned media to determine if loss of identified targets inhibits Dsg1 loss. Overall,
these studies will elucidate novel paracrine signaling between keratinocytes and melanoma cells and identify the
molecular mechanisms by which melanoma cells can control keratinocyte secretion of pro-melanoma factors."

Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury is a multifactorial event characterized by oxidative stress and
mitochondrial damage. Interrupted blood supply establishes ischemia, and restoration of flow introduces a
second wave of damage caused by uncontrolled reduction of oxygen (i.e., superoxide). Superoxide and nitric
oxide produced by nitric oxide synthase in the myocardium initiates both lipid peroxidation and nitration in cell
membranes. Lipid peroxidation mechanisms and consequences have been the focus of many studies, yet efforts
are not matched for lipid nitration. Mechanistically, lipid nitration proceeds by the addition of nitrogen dioxide, a
product of NO and oxygen radical reactions, to conjugated fatty acids. Complex lipids (i.e., triglycerides and
phospholipids) are recognized as the main substrates for lipid nitration. However, their chemical complexity
amplifies the challenges of analytical characterization. Nitrated conjugated linoleic acid (NO2-CLA) is an anti-
inflammatory fatty acid that forms during cardiac IR injury. NO2-CLA formation was first established in a model
of coronary artery ligation, and later work identified the mitochondria as a source of the nitrated species. Due to
its electrophilic character, NO2-CLA reversibly modifies cysteines in target proteins to modulate signaling
cascades. The impacts of NO2-CLA-mediated signaling have been evaluated in inflammatory, autoimmune, and
viral infection preclinical models. Through these studies, covalent targets were identified, including Nf-kB, Keap1,
and STING. Complementary to preclinical efforts, in a small clinical study of cardiac arrest, plasma levels of NO2-
CLA correlated with patient survival. Despite this evidence, the mechanism of NO2-CLA formation in IR remains
to be established, as well as the target protective signaling pathways. Given that phospholipids represent a major
class of lipids in the myocardium and accumulate CLA, it is hypothesized that during cardiac IR injury, CLA
esterified to phospholipids acts as a scavenger for nitration radicals, forming NO2-CLA that is released by
phospholipases to initiate protective signaling cascades by modification of protein thiol targets. This hypothesis
will be tested by the following two Aims: Aim 1: Establish that CLA esterified to phospholipids is a target for lipid
nitration. Aim 2: Determine the protein targets that are modified by NO2-CLA during IR injury. Using cardiac H9c2
cells and isolated hearts subject to IR conditions, we will evaluate lipid nitration products, covalent targets, and
protection endpoints. Mass spectrometry and novel bio-orthogonal labeling will serve as the experimental pillars,
as they bring analytical value, physiological relevance, and innovation to this project. Overall, the proposed work
will be the first to demonstrate the role of myocardial phospholipid nitration in establishing levels of NO2-CLA for
the activation of protective and anti-inflammatory signaling pathways during IR injury."

Transposons are ubiquitous genomic elements that can mobilize, replicate, and integrate within the host
genome. Extensive research has focused on how transposons impact their host, revealing instances of both
deleterious and selectively advantageous roles. While transposon exonization (defined as the inclusion of
transposon-derived exons into cellular transcripts through alternative splicing) is common, the biological
relevance of transposon-derived transcript isoforms remains unclear and controversial. Here, I propose to
investigate transposon exonization in coding regions as an important, recurrent evolutionary mechanism that
drives adaptive proteome diversification, specifically in the context of host-pathogen arms races.
 In preliminary studies, I re-analyzed long-read transcriptome data from human macrophages and
discovered hundreds of poorly characterized isoforms derived from transposon exonization events for genes
involved in immune and inflammatory responses. These include a transposon-derived isoform of the type I
interferon receptor subunit 2 gene (IFNAR2), which I have experimentally shown to act as a novel immune decoy
receptor. I will use alternative splicing of the IFNAR2 gene as a model to reconstruct the genomic events that
can lead to the successful exonization of transposons to form functional protein isoforms (Aim 1), with the goal
of reconstructing the genetic basis of the “road to co-option” of exonized transposons. Using IFNAR2 as a model,
I will then investigate which mechanisms and factors are involved in the regulation of alternative splicing and
expression of transcribed transposon-derived coding alternative exons (Aim 2). Finally, I will compare long-read
RNA sequencing de novo transcriptome assemblies from multiple species of the vertebrate tree of life to evaluate
the incidence of proteins that evolved through the inclusion of transposons in coding sequences (Aim 3). Taken
together, these aims will establish an experimental framework to test the role of transposable elements in
adaptive proteome diversification, and shed light on the process of how transposons can evolve novel functions
beneficial for their host (transposon co-option) through their inclusion in coding regions. Additionally, they will
provide me with new training in: 1) techniques for testing and validating mechanisms of mRNA and alternative
splicing regulation; 2) how to design and perform immunological assays, including viral infections; and 3) the
execution and troubleshooting of genome-scale screens for phenotypes of interest and training in primary cell
culture and genome engineering. Additionally, I will learn how to perform high throughput long-read RNA
sequencing and isoform-specific transcriptome assembly for model and non-model species. The research and
training provided by this proposal will prepare me to launch my own research group studying how transposon
co-option shapes the evolution of vertebrate proteomes."

Newly synthesized DNA represents an ideal system to understand the molecule mechanisms governing
chromatin structure and gene expression. Chromatin structure controls transcription by modulating DNA
accessibility. During DNA replication, chromatin structure must be disassembled to allow for passage of the
replication fork, which generates an intermediate chromatin structure distinct from mature chromatin. Failure to
reestablish proper chromatin structure leads to spurious gene expression and is associated with a variety of
human diseases. Transcription factors (TFs) are a critical component of chromatin structure that regulate
transcription by binding to targeted sequences on DNA and altering chromatin structure. Following replication
fork passage, TF binding sites become occluded by nucleosomes. As nucleosomes are refractory to TF
binding, it is unclear when or how TFs rebind to targeted DNA sequences to reestablish mature chromatin
structure. Furthermore, in-spite of the established role for TFs in regulating gene expression, it is unclear what
effect TF binding has on chromatin structure. To address these gaps in knowledge, I will use novel techniques
termed Nascent CUT&Tag and Nascent Fiber-seq to profile TF binding on nascent DNA and during the
subsequent steps of chromatin maturation. In Aim 1, I will use Nascent CUT&Tag to determine the kinetics
and mechanisms of TF binding to nascent chromatin. This aim will test whether TFs can associate with
nucleosomal DNA during the process of rebinding, or whether accessible DNA is necessary for TFs to bind
following replication fork passage. In Aim 2, I will visualize TF binding and nascent chromatin maturation on
the single molecule level. By simultaneously visualizing TF binding and surrounding chromatin structure, I will
be able to assess the direct impacts of TF binding on critical chromatin features such as nucleosome
positioning and RNA polymerase II occupancy. In Aim 3, I will characterize the impacts of nucleosome
turnover on TF binding and chromatin maturation. Using the anti-cancer drug aclarubicin, I will drive elevated
nucleosome turnover and observe the effects on TF binding and nascent chromatin maturation. These studies
will provide critical insights into the features regulating TF binding and chromatin assembly, which will inform
our understanding of the underlying mechanisms regulating gene expression and cell fate specification. The
training outlined in this proposal will provide a strong foundation to develop as an independent investigator
studying the critical relationship between chromatin structure and gene expression."

youth for suicidal thoughts and behaviors have increased over the last decade. The ED represents a critical
contact point to detect suicide risk and initiate preventive interventions. Youth who visit the ED for suicidal
thoughts or behaviors remain at high risk after discharge, with as many as 22% attempting suicide within one
year. Thus, effective interventions are needed for the high-risk period following ED discharge. Caring Contacts
are brief, supportive messages that have been shown to prevent suicide attempts and suicides among adults
after inpatient psychiatric hospitalizations or ED visits, but there has been limited evaluation of Caring Contacts
for adolescents. The objective of this proposal is to adapt and implement Caring Contacts delivered via text
message to adolescents with suicidal thoughts or behaviors following discharge from the ED. To do so, Dr.
Hoffmann will pursue the following specific aims: (1) adapt Caring Contacts delivered via text message to align
with adolescent preferences, (2) develop a multicomponent implementation strategy for delivery of Caring
Contacts via text message for adolescents following an ED visit for suicidal thoughts or behaviors, and (3) pilot
Caring Contacts via text message to assess feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary intervention effectiveness
and implementation outcomes. Results will provide the data necessary for a planned R01 that is a full-scale
hybrid effectiveness-implementation type II study of Caring Contacts for adolescents. The proposal is closely
aligned with the National Institute of Mental Health Strategic Priority 3.2.A, “establishing the safety and efficacy
of efficacious therapeutic interventions developed for adult populations in children” and addresses an urgent
need to prevent youth suicide during the high-risk post-discharge period. This intervention is scalable for
widespread use and has potential for high impact to prevent youth suicide."

Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is genetic disorder that effects approximately 30,000 people in the United states and more
then 70,000 worldwide. CF is caused by mutations in the epithelial chloride channel CF transmembrane
conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. In CF, loss-of-function mutations in CFTR, reduces chloride efflux from
cells, and elevates the activity of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) through a mechanism that is not fully
understood. This results in an increase sodium and water reabsorption, which ultimately leads to dehydration of
the epithelial surface and reduction in mucus transport in multiple mucin-producing organs, such as the lungs,
sinuses, intestine, pancreas, and reproductive organs. CF patients develop clinical symptoms in all these mucus-
producing organs. In particular, most CF patients have shortened lifespans because of loss of CFTR in the
respiratory tract, but also develop gut phenotypes early in the progression of the disease. These gut phenotypes
are less studied than the lung phenotypes of CF but still significantly impact CF patients lives. While CF is caused
by many different mutations in CFTR, the differences in CFTR function cannot explain the differences in patient
symptoms. This indicates that many of the clinical phenotypes of CF are influenced by genetic modifiers and/or
environmental factors. These genetic modifiers and environmental factors could be additional targets to develop
treatments for CF that could be used to treat all patients regardless of the mutation they harbor. However, many
of the potential genetic modifiers of CF are not well studied and the mechanism by which they modify CF
phenotypes is unknown.
 Our lab has recently identified a Drosophila ortholog of the CFTR gene and established a CF model in
the fly gut epithelium. In addition to observing CF phenotypes in the gut epithelium of CFTR mutant flies, we
uncovered a micro RNA, mir263a, as a negative regulator of ENaC activity. Interestingly, the expression of
mir263a is decreased in CFTR mutant flies, suggesting that that the regulation of ENAC by CFTR is regulated
in part by mir263a. Here, I propose to further characterize the pathology of the fly mutant model including
examining how bacteria can modulate disease phenotypes in this model. I will then use the fly CF model to gain
new insight into ENaC, a known modifier of the CF phenotype. Finally, as the short lifespan, low cost, and genetic
tractability of the fly makes it an ideal model organism to perform genetic screens, I propose to identify new
potential genetic modifiers of CF. Altogether this work will establish Drosophila as a useful model to study CF
and potentially provide new molecular targets for treatment of the disease."
10789849,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Obesity and associated “meta-inflammation” are major risk factors for type-2 diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and cancers. Visceral “white” adiposity drives
these deadly sequelae of obesity. In contrast, thermogenic “brown” and “beige” adipose can uniquely catabolize
stored fat, and are potently anti-obesogenic. The anti-obesity activity of thermogenic adipocytes requires
activation by peripheral signals, and the identification of these signals is key to leveraging the therapeutic
potential of these cells. Such thermogenic adipose is also thought to be anti-inflammatory but the mechanistic
basis of this is unclear. Understanding the mechanisms that promote this anti-inflammatory function of
thermogenic fat would have major therapeutic potential. Thermogenic fat is rich in mitochondria which produce
a vast array of metabolites, many of which possess signaling capacity. Interestingly the tricarboxylic acid
intermediate succinate is an important signaling molecule that controls both thermogenic adipose function and
inflammation. I identified that thermogenic fat has a unique capacity to sequester succinate from the extracellular
milieu (through an undefined mechanism) to promote thermogenesis; while immune cells express a G-protein
coupled receptor (termed succinate receptor 1), the ligation of which is potently pro-inflammatory. I hypothesize
that activation of thermogenic adipose tissue will promote an anti-inflammatory phenotype by altering the levels
of important signaling metabolites, such as succinate, that are known to regulate immune cell function. Moreover,
I predict manipulation of these signals will aid in the treatment of metabolic disease.
Objectives:
1) What is the succinate transport mechanism in thermogenic fat?
2) Can thermogenic fat limit circulating succinate and inflammation in obesity-driven pathologies?
3) Can we manipulate thermogenic fat to modify the pathology of NAFLD?
This work will use both in vitro primary brown fat cell culture and in vivo models of visceral adipose expansion
and thermogenesis. This will be coupled with liquid-chromatography/mass spectrometry (LCMS), genetic
manipulation, and pharmacological methods to clarify the causality between thermogenic fat and inflammatory
signaling. My research experience has afforded me with a skill set that is unique in the world, that will allow me
to study the metabolic cross-talk between the adipose and immune systems. Working with Drs. Chouchani and
Spiegelman, experts in the fields of thermogenesis and metabolism, I will become proficient in the study and
manipulation of adipocyte biology and LCMS analysis and these skills will be coupled with my strong background
in immunology. The diverse and rich scientific environment at DFCI adds fuel to my enthusiasm to establish
myself as an independent investigator and drives my determination to ensure that I make a success of it."

An estimated 3 million people are affected by glaucoma in the United States, and increasing life expectancy
exacerbates the disease’s socio-economic impact. Glaucoma and other optic neuropathies lead to permanent
damage of the optic nerve and loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). No therapies are currently available to
mitigate irreversible vision loss. The feasibility of cell replacement therapy was recently demonstrated using
RGCs isolated from a developing retina. Furthermore, we have shown that it is possible to achieve robust and
reproducible transplants with stem cell-derived RGCs. While our donor RGCs survived in host retinas following
transplantation, cell survival does not equate to the restoration of vision, and poor structural and functional
integration remains a significant challenge for successful RGC replacement.
One of the key molecular features limiting donor RGC integration into the existing circuitry is likely to be the
vestigial homophilic molecular cues that guide somatic spacing and dendritic arborization during development.
Down Syndrome Cell Adhesion Molecule (DSCAM) has been identified as a key molecular cue that mediates
neuronal self-avoidance to prevent fasciculation and preserve mosaic spacing in the retina during development.
We hypothesize that these same mechanisms govern the integration of transplanted RGCs and that
homophilic molecular cues, including DSCAM, limit donor RGC migration towards their natural
connecting points within the retina. Therefore, this proposal aims to investigate DSCAM in the context of RGC
transplantation to understand how self-avoidance mechanisms contribute to neural circuit development and
repair.
Using RGC transplantation into the retina as a model system, we will determine if DSCAM-mediated self-
avoidance mechanisms are dose-mediated, rely on transcellular interactions, and function similarly irrespective
of neural migration. To investigate the need for transcellular DSCAM expression for RGC self-avoidance, we will
conduct a series of transplantation experiments using gain- and lose-of-function (GOF and LOF) mice.
Expression of DSCAM by mouse stem cell-derived RGC will be suppressed with siRNA before intravitreal
injections. Similarly, to investigate if DSCAM regulates donor RGC spacing independent of the mode of
migration, we will suppress DSCAM in host and donor RGCs while temporarily destabilizing the donor RGC’s
cytoskeleton to alter their migratory modality between somal translocation and multipolar migration. Live imaging
and quantitative immunohistochemistry will be used to assess donor cell morphology and distribution in the
retina. Anterograde tracing and retinal explants cultured on multielectrode arrays will be used to evaluate
synapse formation with host bipolar cells. Altogether, this mechanistic approach would significantly impact the
development of cell replacement therapy for glaucoma and other neurodegenerative diseases."

Synthetic lethality screens hold great promise for cancer therapy since they enable the identification of
chemical compounds that selectively target tumor cells while sparing normal tissue. This approach presumes
that cancer cells harboring a specific mutation will be more sensitive to manipulation of certain pathways than
normal cells that lack the mutation. The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor-suppressor gene is functionally lost in
about 90% of Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinomas (ccRCCs). Because VHL-deficient ccRCCs resist current
therapies and frequently metastasize, identifying effective new therapies will be crucial for achieving long-
lasting responses. This project’s long-term goal is to therapeutically target VHL-deficient ccRCCs using a
synthetic lethality approach, and to move the most promising therapeutics to clinical trials. Here we propose
to investigate cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors as synthetic lethality-based therapeutics for targeting
ccRCC. We have validated a multi-CDK inhibitor—Dinaciclib—as a therapeutic candidate with potent in vivo
activity in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX)-based orthotopic mouse model of ccRCC. Our preliminary data
indicate that several specific CDK9 inhibitors (CDK9i)—AZD4573, NVP-2, and KB-0742—mimic Dinaciclib-
induced death of VHL-deficient cells in vitro. CDK9 represents a promising therapeutic target since: (1) it is a
non-canonical CDK regulating RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription; (2) multiple CDK9i have been
developed, with several undergoing clinical trials in cancers other than ccRCC. Accordingly, our goal is to
evaluate AZD4573 as a potential therapeutic for ccRCC. Our objectives are to dissect the mechanism of
synthetic lethality in vitro, and assess AZD4573 efficacy in vivo, including its effects on anti-tumor immunity.
We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) Dissect the mechanism of synthetic lethality of CDK9 inhibition
with VHL loss in vitro, where we will test the hypothesis that there is a cross-talk between VHL and CDK9
pathways, affecting each other’s activity. We will also test the involvement of several candidate pathways
downstream of CDK9 (MCL-1 and Bfl-1 pro-survival proteins) and VHL (HIF-1 and HIF-2) in synthetic lethality
to determine the biomarkers of tumor response; and 2) Evaluate CDK inhibitor AZD4573 as a potential
therapeutic in an orthotopic PDX-based and immunocompetent models of ccRCC, the latter conducted in
combination with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)—anti-PD1. ICIs represent a current front-line treatment for
ccRCC, and literature indicates that CDK inhibition by Dinaciclib and a specific CDK9i induce anti-tumor
immunity, potentiating their anti-tumor effects. Accordingly, our working hypothesis is that CDK9i will slow the
tumor growth in immunodeficient model and cause tumor regression in immunocompetent model, especially
when combined with ICI. Successful completion of the experimental plan will provide an efficient therapeutic
strategy for VHL-deficient ccRCC—CDK9i + ICI combination treatment. Dissecting the mechanism of synthetic
lethality will allow for patient stratification into potential responders and non-responders."

 Morehouse School of Medicine’s (MSM) proposes a G-RISE training and career
development program with the objective of addressing the deficits of biomedical scientists from
underrepresented communities in the biomedical research workforce. A recent external review
of MSM’s Graduate Education in Biomedical Sciences (GEBS) Program revealed that while
the program’s success has been satisfactory in terms of persistence in the PhD curriculum and
graduation, there is the continued need for tuition support for PhD students, skills development
to increase competitiveness, expanding the pool of potential mentors, and expanding
knowledge and preparation for academic and non-academic biomedical careers particularly in
data science, bioinformatics and genomics.
 We propose two specific goals and objectives of the proposed G-RISE program. In
Goal 1, we will support pre-doctoral graduate students in completing the Ph.D. Program
with the knowledge base and skill set that will make them competitive for the
biomedical research workforce. In Goal 2, we will leverage MSM Centers and Institutes,
Student Learning Communities, and the Office of Career Connections to enhance the
graduate experience and prepare G-RISE Scholars for academic and non-academic
biomedical careers. The anticipated milestones include; increased numbers of abstracts
accepted for presentation and increased numbers of published manuscripts; reach the optimal
average graduation rate of 90% for G-RISE Scholars with an average of 80% of them entering
the biomedical research workforce; expanding the data science, bioinformatics and
genomic curricula; and increasing the quality and diversity of the mentor pool available to G-
RISE Scholars and the overall graduate program.
 To accomplish these milestones, the G-RISE Program will include hands-on, focused
skill development workshops; fellowship application development mini-camps; and active
learning training for investigators. Sponsored seminars will include; seminars given by
scientific leaders in their respective fields; student-led seminars to develop scientific
presentation skills; and career development seminars. Additionally, the G-RISE program staff
will enhance the academic experience of graduate students through Learning Communities,
career exploration via the Office of Career Connections, and provide exposure to rapidly
developing fields such as Data Science, Bioinformatics and Genomics."
10931704,"Osteosarcoma (OSA) is the most common primary malignancy of bone in children and
adolescents, accounting for approximately 5% of all childhood tumors (www.cancer.gov).
Osteosarcoma occurs primarily in the long bones of the limbs, including most commonly the
femur, tibia, and humerus1. The current standard of care therapy for human patients diagnosed
with OSA includes multi-agent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (doxorubicin + cisplatin +/-
methotrexate) followed by surgical resection of the primary lesion and adjuvant chemotherapy,
curing approximately 60 to 70% of patients 1–3. However, up to 40% of newly diagnosed patients
presenting with localized disease eventually develop metastases to the lung, indicating that
many patients already have micrometastases present in the lung at the time of diagnosis or
develop them during the perioperative period 4. The 5-year survival rate for children with
metastatic OSA is extremely low, hovering around 20%-30%, a rate that has not improved in
over 30 years 2. Clearly, novel therapies are in critical need, specifically molecules capable of
inhibiting the process of OSA metastasis. PharmaIN is developing immunomodulating peptide
with unique anti-tumor and anti-fibrotic properties for the treatment of osteosarcoma and other

trial in canine OSA patients as a translation tool for human and concurrent product development
for veterinary applications. The additional proposed work is IND enabling for a Phase 1 human

10822347,"Project Summary
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, devastating disease with the initial pathognomonic instigator
being a combination of genetic and environmental (injurious) factors including hypoxemia and reactive oxygen
species (ROS) signaling. PAH is characterized by aggressive lung endothelial cell (EC)/smooth muscle cell
(SMC) proliferation/migration (remodeling) in balance with apoptosis, senescence and several other factors all
leading to ensuing right ventricle (RV) failure. Hypoxia and EC injury in rodents spawn physiological and cellular
signaling changes resembling hallmark changes observed in human PAH. We postulated that NADPH oxidase
1 (NOX1) and attendant ROS mediate EC proliferation and hemodynamic changes occurring in PAH. Findings
from our lab have shown induction of NOX1 and ROS in tissue from PAH patients and in human pulmonary
artery endothelial cells (HPAECs). Furthermore, the laboratory’s preliminary findings implicate AMPK isoform
alpha-1 (AMPKα1) as a potential lynchpin in the NOX1 pro-proliferative pathway. Mechanistically speaking, we
deduced that redox-sensitive cysteines (Cys 299 & 304) in AMPKα1 would be susceptible to oxidation, which
would, in turn, augment AMPKα1 activity. Using the bioinformatic tools of STRING, TRANSFAC and Orange, I
discovered that phosphorylated/activated AMPKα1 is associated with cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1
(p21cip1), a member of the Cip/Kip family of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors. Importantly, the subcellular
localization of p21cip1 dictates its cellular function. In the nucleus, the Cip/Kip family promotes apoptosis and
senescence through retinoblastoma (Rb)-mediated suppression of the cell cycle. In contrast, when
phosphorylated and largely localized in the cytosol, p21cip1 purportedly indirectly actuates (disinhibits) cyclin D
and CDK4/6 leading to Rb inhibition (by phosphorylation) and a permissive cell cycle progression. Therefore, we
postulate that NOX1 mediates oxidative activation of AMPKα1 subunit via oxidizing cysteines 229 and/or 304
(Cys299/304). This is expected to phosphorylate p21cip1 leading to disinhibited binding from cyclin/CDK and cell
cycle progression and EC hyperproliferation in PAH. To test this overarching hypothesis, the following aims will
be tested: (1) To determine whether Nox1-induced oxidation of AMPKα1 elicits p21cip1 family disinhibition of
CyclinD/CDK4/6 and EC proliferation/migration; (2) To Interrogate the effect of EC NOX1 in the promotion of
vascular remodeling and hemodynamic changes in PAH animal models (Mouse and Rat Su/Hx). This proposal
is expected to reveal previously unidentified pathways controlled by NOX1 that participate in the pathology of
PAH. Additionally, an F31 award at this time will enhance my ability to grow as a young scientist and develop
the skills needed to obtain my PhD and pursue a career in the biomedical sciences."

The ongoing epidemic of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), particularly in men who have sex with men
(MSM), is worsening as the fear of HIV and the acceptance/use of barrier methods (e.g condoms) decreases.
STI diagnostics are the critical gateway to treatment, yet traditional test methods (i.e., mail-in kits and centralized
labs) are decidedly ineffective for the individuals and groups most impacted by STIs, such as MSM, economically
disadvantaged communities/countries, and those without health insurance. As stated by the WHO, “A major
barrier to STI control and prevention is the unavailability of reliable, low-cost, point-of-care (POC) tests which
allow diagnosis and treatment in a single visit.” Indeed, technology for POC STI tests that can be accessed at
local clinics and performed by “lay health workers” during the patient visit are needed to address ongoing STI
socioeconomic health disparities. Salus has invented 3STEP, a POC nucleic acid test (NAT) platform that
addresses this critical need by enabling laboratory performance at the POC in a format that is as easy to perform
as a rapid antigen test in <35 min using a single swab/sample. Laboratory performance in 3STEP is
accomplished via exclusion-based sample preparation (ESP) for high-purity extraction/concentration (an often
skipped but vitally important step in POC-NAT tests, particularly samples with more complex matrix such as anal
swabs), while its POC simplicity and affordability is enabled by novel stabilized interface technology (SIFT). The
single disposable device performs sample collection, nucleic acid extraction, and amplification/detection in
spatially separated wells that enables rapid development of multiplexed test panels. Unlike many other POC
NATs, there are no microfluidic valves, pumps, or electronics, minimizing costs, e-waste, and manufacturing
complexity. Salus Discovery is now applying 3STEP to meet important POC STI testing needs. Specifically, in
collaboration with Dr. Striker (MD, PhD) at the University of Wisconsin, we target a significant need/opportunity
in the MSM population identified by the groundbreaking ANCHOR study for an anal HPV NAT to detect infections
with high risk of anal cancer (no approved test is currently available for anal swabs). The multiplexing capability
of 3STEP allows us to also target the need for lab-quality POC single-visit testing and treatment for the curable
and highly prevalent STIs Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG). We have preliminary
data in the 3STEP platform with HPV 16, HPV 18, CT, and NG detection chemistries. Thus, in Aim 1 we will
focus on optimizing and integrating the STI test chemistries into a panel and in Aim 2 we will use this panel to
(i) efficiently assess the ability to detect each pathogen in actual patient samples, and (ii) compare different
sampling methodologies (anal CT/NG swab vs. anal HPV cytology swab) setting the stage for a Phase II
proposal."

Project Summary
This project addresses the Advancing Research on Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and AD-Related Dementias
(ADRD) Initiative of the National Institute on Aging (PAS-22-196). We propose to develop an advanced
hardware-software package, ADRD360, to optimally acquire, process, and analyze magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) in the human brain. The ADRD360 will help to localize metabolic
signatures and obtain MRI and MRS brain data at much higher resolutions than currently possible on
clinical MR systems. Highly resolved MRI and MRS will be of utmost importance to aid in the early
prediction of the risk of developing AD. The ADRD360 may lead to the early detection of structural and
metabolic parameters as predictive diagnostic tool biomarkers in patients with AD, ADRD, other
neurological disorders and psychiatric diseases. This project will offer a complete solution with the
development and optimization of 1) advanced radio-frequency (RF) coils approaching ultimate intrinsic
signal-to-noises (UISNRs) and acceptable specific absorption rates (SARs); 2) pushing structural MR
imaging resolutions over commercial devices; 3) advancing shimming procedures to improve the
homogeneity of the B0 field; 4) permitting high-resolution, multi-dimensional, multi-volume MRS exams
with 100% structure-function correlation in reasonable scan times; 5) a stand-alone, easy-to-use program
that provides the crucial link between multi-dimensional structural and multi-volume MRS acquisition,
including its clinical and metabolic interpretation by effectively tackling the demanding spectral processing
and analysis needs; and 6) a comprehensive MRI-MRS metrics system calibration, quality assurance and
validation phantom essential to confirm reproducibility of measurements. Initially, we will demonstrate the
research utility and clinical applicability by determining the structural and metabolic MRI-MRS parameter
spread in healthy subjects. Results from this study will become essential to interpretation in subjects at
higher risk of developing AD. This work builds upon our expertise in creating the first commercial dual-
tuned 1H-31P 1.5T and 3T head coils (R44NS037273). This research also builds upon our work with the
development of an automated B0 shimming program (FWHM 11.7 ± 1.9 Hz, n=94 at 1.5T) and the
interactive MRS software. This project will offer 'A Complete Solution for the Early AD Detection’ with
advanced brain MR assessments in the high-resolution structural and functional MRI exams, and
multinuclear metabolic-based MRS acquisitions. Our licensed Siemens vendor agreement will propel the
development and commercialization of the ADRD360. We aim to satiate the researchers by approaching
the ultimate intrinsic SNR 31P and 1H limits on the 3T and 7T MR systems. We plan to demonstrate the
clinical advantages by identifying critical structural and metabolic MR brain parameters that can be used
as screening biomarkers in humans with mild cognitive impairment due to aging, AD, and related dementia.

This T32 grant, Impact of Biological, Clinical, and Social Determinants on Trauma and Trauma
Outcomes, will provide the training and mentoring to create the next generation of physician scientists.
Physician-scientists are a critical element of the workforce necessary to improve the health of patients.
Injuries and deaths from traumatic injury represent the major cause of death and impaired function among
people under the age of 44. This morbidity and mortality creates a disproportionate drain on healthcare
resources due to the typical young age of the trauma patient. Additionally, new advances in identifying the
scope of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (football players' brain injury) show the need for increased
investment in the basic science of trauma. Trauma also disproportionately affects underserved minority
patients, resulting in increased healthcare disparities in the United States. This highlights the need for
scientists who will lead studies to improve our understanding of and develop interventions to reduce
disparities in trauma care, risk of interpersonal violence (child abuse, intimate partner violence, elder
abuse) leading to trauma, and social determinants and trauma. This competing renewal will build on the
success of the prior ten years of funding. These successes include effective recruitment of minority
physicians into the program, 112 publications authored by 17 trainees, including 54 first-author
publications. Some of the significant changes in the new application include inclusion of health services
and population sciences faculty mentors to support and mentor trainees increasing interest in these areas
of research related to causes and outcomes of traumatic events. This grant specifically requests funding for
two postdoctoral fellows for two years of training, a formula which has proven successful since inception of
this training program. The Executive Committee works closely with the individual trainees to identify
mentors whose research matches the interests of the trainees. All of our prior trainees have been drawn
from the residency programs at Boston Medical Center, the largest safety net hospital in New England.
There is exceptional institutional commitment manifest by the support for the recruitment and retention of
minority physicians and trainees with disabilities. The productivity of trainees both during and after their
participation in this fellowship demonstrate that we have prepared our trainees for academic careers."

Molecular interactions between hosts and microbes have substantial impact on host physiology,
development, and disease symptomology. This training program will support five postdoctoral scholars to
collaborate with faculty-led research groups at Cornell in the study of how molecular interactions between
microbes (bacteria, fungi and viruses) and their animal and plant hosts manifest as major traits in the host.
Eligible trainees will be recruited from top Ph.D. programs in the nation and world, with a concerted
emphasis on recruitment of trainees who affiliate with groups that are historically underrepresented in
biological research. Trainees will work in collaboration two or more trainer labs but will have considerable
research independence and a discretionary research allowance. All trainees will have intellectual
ownership over their projects and will be allowed to carry their postdoctoral research into subsequent
independent positions if they so desire. The role of the training mentors will be to provide the necessary
infrastructure and resources to support the research, and to cultivate trainee development and
preparedness for independent research-related careers in academia, industry, or government.
Training will be coordinated through the Cornell Institute of Host-Microbe Interactions and Disease
(CIHMID) and will include a substantial component of professional development in addition to the research
training. The research component will emphasize specialized training using advanced methodologies in a
highly interdisciplinary environment, exploiting comparison across diverse biological systems to maximize
intellectual breadth, creativity, and insight. The professional development will include an array of activities
and workshops designed to help trainees secure and be successful in the subsequent position of their
choice. Each trainee will work with a tailored mentoring committee to create a personalized Individual
Development Plan (IDP) that will include annual objectives and benchmarks for both the research and
professional development components."

Catalytic C-H bond functionalization has emerged as a powerful approach in synthetic organic chemistry for the
discovery and production of new pharmaceuticals. The next generation C-H bond functionalization methods
described in this proposal will enable the rapid assembly of pharmaceutically relevant compounds from simple
and readily available inputs. In one program, we will access complex molecular architectures in a single step
from simple precursors by the sequential three-component coupling of a C-H bond and two different types of
coupling partners. Because many different coupling partners are effective for conventional C-H bond additions
to one coupling partner, sequential three-component reactions utilitizing different combinations of coupling
partners should provide access to an enormous diversity of motifs relevant to drug and natural product synthesis.
Preliminary results obtained with MIRA funding have established the feasibility and utility of this approach. In a
second program, we will apply reversible light-mediated C-H bond activation to obtain the most stable from the
most accessible heterocycle stereoisomer. Saturated heterocycles such as piperidines, morpholines,
piperazines, and lactams are prevalent in drugs and drug candidates but are often most efficiently prepared as
the less stable stereoisomer. However, light-mediated processes can enable their highly stereoselective
conversion to the more stable stereoisomer as we recently demonstrated for piperidines with MIRA funding. In
a third program, we will broadly develop nitrogen heterocycle synthesis by imidoyl C-H functionalization. Imines
derived from readily available aldehydes and primary amines are centrally important intermediates in organic
synthesis. With MIRA funding, we developed a new approach for the efficient preparation of purine bioisosteres
by imidoyl C-H activation of imines followed by in situ annulation with different coupling partners. Purine
bioisosteres are found in large numbers of drugs and drug candidates, especially those that interact with
biomolecular targets that have purine recognition motifs such as receptors, kinases, and mRNA. We will leverage
our methods for the synthesis of purine bioisosteres to target the transcriptome and will apply imidoyl C-H
activation and annulation to prepare other important heterocycles. With MIRA funding we advanced new enzyme
inhibitor discovery approaches and potent and selective inhibitors to challenging enzyme targets. In proposed
research, we will directly apply C-H functionalization to biological inquiry. For example, our methods for the
synthesis and elaboration of dihydropyridines enable the rapid preparation of amine-containing structures with
three-dimensional display of functionality and stereoselective introduction of multiple stereogenic centers,
features increasingly sought after in medicinal chemistry endeavors. These approaches will be applied to the
discovery of potent and selective ligands to challenging biomolecular targets relevant to the treatment of unmet
medical conditions, including the identification of CNS penetrant, highly selective ligands to aminergic GPCRs."

 With the support of PAS-20-160 “Small R01s for Clinical Trials Targeting Diseases within the Mission of
NIDDK,” we will perform a feasibility study to test our overall hypothesis that TRE presents a viable
alternative to caloric restriction for improving glycemic measures and reducing weight in
overweight/obese patients [BMI:25-35 kg/m2] with metformin-only treated Type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The
rationale for this study arises from the observation that intentional caloric restriction plays an integral part in
glycemic management in patients with newly diagnosed/early-stage T2DM. Yet intentional caloric restriction is
difficult to sustain due to multiple barriers, including challenges arising from acquiring the necessary
knowledge, teaching the intervention, cost of delivery and potential burden on quality of life. In contrast to
intentionally restricting calories, time restricted eating (TRE), focuses on restricting the eating window. This
simplified view of eating allows participants to eat ad libitum per their dietary preferences during a daily time
frame. TRE is associated with weight loss in patients without T2DM and improves glycemic measures in
patients with prediabetes, however its effects on glycemic measures, especially when accounting for weight
change, in patients with T2DM remains unknown.
 This study will involve a 24-week intervention of TRE vs Caloric Restriction (n=56 total, n=28 per group)
which will be staff supervised for 12 weeks and self-maintained for 12 weeks. We will use innovative state of
the art technology such as Zoom-based virtual visits, mobile phone-based food record, wifi-enabled scale for
weekly weights, continuous glucose monitoring and actigraphy to implement our interventions and assess
outcomes. Our Specific Aims include: Aim #1: Compare the effect of TRE vs Caloric Restriction on glycemic
measures, Aim#2: Compare the effect of TRE vs Caloric Restriction on weight, Aim #3: Compare the effect of
TRE vs Caloric Restriction on intervention burden. The impact and significance of this feasibility study is to
provide preliminary data to support a definitive randomized controlled trial of TRE to treat hyperglycemia in
patients with T2DM."
10825529,"VSMCs dedifferentiate into a proliferative state upon vessel injury or transdifferentiate into macrophage-like
cells (MLCs) during atherosclerosis progression. VSMC phenotypic switching are driven by multiple
transcriptional and epigenetic changes that lead to increased proliferation with reduced contractile gene
expression and increased matrix production, which is detrimental to atherosclerotic lesions, direct
interventional studies that target this process have been lacking. Increased matrix and growth factors alter
integrin signaling and leads to aberrant focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activation, which may promote VSMC
phenotypic switching. We demonstrated that FAK is inactive and primarily localized in the nuclei of VSMCs of
healthy arteries. However, vessel injury promoted FAK activation and cytoplasmic relocalization, which
increased cyclin D1 transcription and cell cycling. While we found that inhibition of FAK activity in VSMCs
induced nuclear localization of FAK and increased contractile gene transcription, the underlying mechanism by
which FAK regulates the contractile genes is not known. We have identified DNA methyltransferase 3A
(DNMT3A) and the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, two key epigenetic repression
machineries, as nuclear FAK-interacting partners in VSMCs. FAK inhibition decreased DNMT3A and NuRD
component expression, which was associated with decreased DNA methylation and increased active histone
marks within contractile gene promoters. Using genetic FAK cytoplasmic (Cyto) restricted VSMCs, we found
that nuclear FAK is required for reducing DNMT3A/NuRD and for increasing contractile gene expression.
Additionally, ApoE-/-;FAK-Cyto mice showed increased atherosclerosis compared to WT mice, suggesting that
active cytoplasmic FAK exacerbates atherosclerosis. Further, FAK showed increased cytoplasmic localization
and activity within human atherosclerotic lesions compared to healthy specimens. Importantly, FAK inhibitor
reduced advanced atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE-/- mice, which was associated with reduced DNMT3A and
NuRD component expression with increased ACTA2+ cells in the fibrous cap. Our hypothesis is that FAK
catalytic inhibition forces FAK nuclear localization and promotes VSMC differentiation via reduced expression
of epigenetic regulators DNMT3A and NuRD complex. Aim 1 will elucidate the molecular mechanism of
nuclear FAK-mediated VSMC phenotypic switching via epigenetic modulation of DNA methylation, chromatin
remodeling, and histone modification. Aim 2 will investigate the role of DNMT3A and the NuRD complex in
VSMC dedifferentiation upon vascular injury using both DNMT3A and NuRD genetic models. Aim 3 will
evaluate the effect of FAK inhibition on blocking VSMC transdifferentiation and promoting plaque stability in
early and advanced atherosclerosis. This study will provide new insights into VSMC phenotype switching via
FAK-mediated epigenetic control through DNMT3A and NuRD complex stability. The therapeutic potential of
FAK inhibitors in alleviating intimal thickening in vascular injury and atherosclerosis will also be assessed."
10810831,"Postpartum weight retention (PWR) is a significant contributor to obesity in women of reproductive age. PWR
is associated with continued weight gain, obesity development later in life, and cardiovascular disease
development (CVD). Among postpartum women, standard weight-loss interventions that address diet and
physical activity have produced only modest effects. Prior interventions are limited by not adequately
addressing poor sleep, a common issue in postpartum women. Despite epidemiological evidence on the
relationship between sleep and obesity, standard weight-loss interventions rarely include key elements of sleep
interventions. Integrating sleep interventions with diet and physical activity may enhance weight loss among
postpartum women. The overall goal of this K01 is to develop and test the feasibility, acceptability, and
preliminary efficacy of Sleep GOALS (Goal-focused Online Access to Lifestyle Support), an Internet-assisted
multiple health behavior (diet, physical activity, and sleep) weight loss intervention for postpartum women. We
will create Sleep GOALS by adapting and integrating an existing sleep intervention (TSC; Transdiagnostic Sleep
and Circadian intervention) with a diet and physical activity weight-loss intervention (GOALS Lifestyles, an
online version of the Diabetes Prevention Program). We will use intervention mapping to guide the 3-step
adaptation process. First, we will conduct semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 12
primiparous women between 3 and 6 months postpartum with overweight or obesity to review the framework
and content of TSC and GOALS Lifestyle to solicit their suggestions for adapting these interventions for
postpartum women. Step 2: We will pre-test the intervention content by reviewing the proposed adaptations
with the same participants. Step 3: We will use feedback from the participants and experts in behavioral sleep
medicine, weight loss interventions, and behavior change to ensure the adaptations maintain the core
elements of the original interventions and address the specific needs of postpartum women. (Aim 1). We will
then randomize 40 postpartum women to Sleep GOALS or an education control group to test the feasibility,
acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of Sleep GOALS (Aim 2). We will use the pilot trial results to inform the
conduct of a larger and definitive randomized controlled trial. A multi-disciplinary team of experts will guide
my training in 1) intervention development, to learn the science of behavioral change, frameworks for
intervention development and adaptation, and principles of user-centered design; 2) behavioral sleep
medicine, to learn to evaluate sleep problems and developing individual sleep management plans; and 3)
randomized controlled trials to learn the best practices of conducting clinical trials research. Consistent
with the NHLBI’s Strategic Goals and Objectives, this training will allow me to become an independent
researcher who develops/adapts behavioral health interventions that target multiple health behaviors to reduce
CVD risk in women during the postpartum period."

The overall goals of this Tropical Medicine Research Center (TMRC), proposed for the Research Institute of
Tropical Medicine (RITM) in the Philippines, are to a) execute the key scientific aims of this study, b) build
research capacity at RITM, and c) build research capacity and support the development of junior investigators
at all TMRCs in partnership with the TMRC coordinating center’s “opportunity funds” and other initiatives
Currently, preventative chemotherapy strategies with Praziquantel (PZQ) are the mainstay of treatment for
schistosomiasis, with “mass drug administration” (MDA) delivered annually or bi-annually. The primary cause
of severe morbidity and death due to intestinal schistosomiasis is portal fibrosis secondary to intra-hepatic egg
deposition with consequent portal hypertension and esophageal varices with high risk of hemorrhage.
Importantly, there are no current recommendations to identify and more aggressively treat individuals with
hepatic fibrosis in most regions, including The Philippines, leaving individuals to receive infrequent, if any,
treatment. Currently, little is known with respect to risk factors for progression to higher grade portal fibrosis,
including biomarkers to identify risk. This is a lost opportunity to mitigate this risk through more frequent
treatment, which has been shown to halt and even reverse fibrosis if identified early. Our groups have
developed a multiplexed “FibroPlex_v2” assay that now captures 38 key analytes involved in fibro-proliferation
or degradation. We will employ this to address the scientific goals of the study which are to:
1) Evaluate biomarkers that will identify individuals with S. japonicum associated hepatic fibrosis as diagnosed
by ultrasound (US) at baseline as well as biomarkers that identify risk of progression from mild-moderate to
higher grades as assessed by US annually for three years
2) To develop diagnostic tests to facilitate identification of high-risk individuals in the field who would ultimately
benefit from more frequent treatment with PZQ or other treatment approaches. We expect many analytes will
predict progression and these will be developed singly or in combination as lateral flow-based assays that can
ultimately be developed as POCTs for use with MDA.
The availability of potential treatment approaches to halt progression, the lack of approaches to reverse higher
grade periportal fibrosis once established, and sub-optimal interventions for addressing portal hypertension
and its high mortality rate once established, make this an ideal screening target. Biomarkers that longitudinally
predict risk of progression to less reversible grades are a crucial first step. The successful execution of these
aims will also build research capacity at RITM and provide outstanding opportunities for related studies through
TMRC “opportunity funds” as well as future grants to evaluate different treatment strategies for individuals at
risk for fibrosis progression with definitive randomized controlled trials."

10791368,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Malaria in pregnancy (MiP) carries substantial - but largely preventable - risks for both the pregnant woman
and unborn child. Despite rigorous evidence supporting the efficacy of current interventions, such as long-lasting
insecticidal nets (LLIN) and intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp), MiP is estimated to
occur in more than 40% of livebirths in endemic areas of sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, additional interventions
that would complement existing strategies are urgently needed One intriguing, but largely unexplored strategy
for preventing MiP would be to reduce the risk of malaria transmission in the home environment, essentially
creating a “safe zone” around the pregnant woman. This strategy has many potential advantages, including (i)
leveraging the spatiotemporal clustering of malaria risk, (ii) bridging gaps in the existing package of interventions
(i.e., imperfect LLIN use and missed IPTp doses), and (iii) the established safety and effectiveness of mass drug
administration (MDA) programs. Therefore, the scientific objective of this Exploratory/Developmental
Grant (R21) application is to demonstrate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of a focal
mass drug administration (fMDA) program for household members of pregnant women to protect against MiP.
Our hypothesis is that eliminating the parasite reservoir within the household will provide a complementary layer
of protection against MiP especially when access to care is limited and visits may be delayed or missed. To
achieve this, we will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to:
 Aim 1: Determine the feasibility and acceptability of a fMDA program with dihydroartemisinin-
piperaquine (DP) as a novel component of the MiP prevention package. We will conduct an open-label,
randomized pilot study at a primary health center in rural western Uganda. Women presenting to their first
antenatal clinic visit will be randomized 1:1:1: to (i) monthly fMDA, (ii) one-time fMDA, or (iii) usual care. Using
an established implementation framework, we will assess process measures such as the proportion of household
members reached, adherence to the course of treatment, and frequency of adverse events.
 Aim 2: Estimate the efficacy of fMDA to create a “safe zone” in the immediate home environment
and ultimately prevent MiP. Using the study design outlined in Aim 1, we will follow participating pregnant
women and associated households through delivery, including longitudinal assessments of P. falciparum
infection. As a pilot study, the trial is deliberately not powered for statistical tests of significance, but we will
measure the incidence of (i) clinical malaria, defined as the presence of typical symptoms (e.g., fever, lethargy)
and a positive malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT), (ii) asymptomatic P. falciparum parasitemia and placental
malaria by PCR throughout pregnancy and (iii) the incidence of adverse birth outcomes (e.g., stillbirth, low birth
weight). In addition, we will measure the prevalence of asymptomatic parasitemia in household members using
RDTs at three time points in order to estimate the effectiveness of fMDA at maintaining a parasite free zone."

10807673,"Project Abstract
The prevalence of neurodevelopmental delays in the United States has increased substantially over the last two
decades, possibly due to increased prenatal exposure to chemical and non-chemical stressors. Persistent
organic pollutants, or POPs, are man-made chemicals that are of health concern given their ubiquitous exposure,
persistence in the environment and human body, and transmission to offspring during pregnancy. For humans,
the most commonly encountered POPs include per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), polybrominated
diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).
Psychosocial stress is also a major public health problem, due to its high prevalence, association with adverse
maternal and child health outcomes, and ability to amplify the adverse health effects of environmental chemicals.
Communities of color, particularly African Americans (AAs), experience the largest burden of POPs exposure
and are disproportionately exposed to non-chemical and psychosocial stressors. However, few studies have
examined chemical and non-chemical stressors together as an exposure mixture, despite our knowledge that
they co-occur and cluster around socioeconomic status. Leveraging an ongoing prospective birth cohort of
African American pregnant people and their children in Atlanta, Georgia, this study will examine the cumulative
effect of prenatal POPs and non-chemical stressors on delayed neurodevelopment in early infancy. The Atlanta
African American Maternal-Child cohort is a socioeconomically diverse and exceptionally phenotyped cohort that
recruits pregnant people during early pregnancy and is following offspring through age 5. This project will take
advantage of the rich biological and questionnaire data, as well as infant cognition assessments. Specifically,
my project will examine sociodemographic characteristics, home product and personal care product usage as
predictors of POPs exposure (Aim 1). This may illuminate interventions and practices aimed at reducing POPs
exposure and ultimately preventing adverse outcomes. In order to better characterize the prenatal exposome,
my analytical approach in Aims 2 and 3 will utilize methods designed for analyzing chemical exposure mixtures
to examine the combined effects of POPs and psychosocial stressors. I will examine the mixture effects of
prenatal exposure to four classes of POPs on infant neurodevelopment (Aim 2) and assess the combined effects
of POPs, racial discrimination, depression, anxiety, and perceived stress on infant neurodevelopment (Aim 3).
My long-term career goal is to become a leader in environmental health sciences, with a focus on maternal and
child health. To build on my previous pre-doctoral and post-doctoral research in perinatal and environmental
epidemiology, I will be mentored by Dr. Dana Barr, a leader in exposure assessment, as well as Drs. Carmen
Marist and Patricia Brennan, experts in studies of the exposome and child neurodevelopment, respectively. The
outstanding training opportunities in high-priority research areas with key leaders in the field will enhance my
skillset and position me well for a career as an independent investigator."
10809777,"Project Summary
How does the human brain encode visual feature conjunctions? Two inﬂuential, yet disparate, research traditions
have proposed two different mechanisms. Research in neurophysiology and computer vision has explored static
conjunction coding, where feature conjunctions are automatically extracted via a feedforward hierarchy. While
efﬁcient, this mechanism may be limited to encoding conjunctions enabled by the hierarchy's learned connectivity.
By contrast, research in cognitive psychology has explored dynamic conjunction coding, which sequentially
encodes task-relevant conjunctions via attentional selection. While slow, this mechanism is ﬂexible and capable
of encoding any feature conjunction. Despite evidence for both mechanisms, their interplay remains unclear. In
this project, we leverage advances in deep learning and open neuroimaging datasets to understand how these
two mechanisms interact in the human brain, yielding the best of both worlds: fast, but ﬂexible conjunction coding.
Through the three complementary Speciﬁc Aims, we advance our understanding of these fundamental issues in
vision science, and on a practical level, develop approaches that can be used to improve computer vision, aiding
the development of useful technologies like autonomous vehicles. In the course of this project, I will master
modern approaches in deep learning and computational neuroscience through the mentorship of my sponsor Dr.
Kriegeskorte and my co-sponsor Dr. Fusi, equipping me for a career leading a lab that bridges cognitive science,
neuroscience, and artiﬁcial intelligence.
Hypotheses: The human brain implements static conjunction coding via neural populations with “and-like” tuning
to feature combinations that emerges via feedforward convergence of neurons tuned to single features, while dy-
namic conjunction coding requires recurrent connections. Static conjunction coding can rapidly encode familiar,
but not unfamiliar conjunctions, while dynamic conjunction coding can encode any conjunction, but more slowly.
Aim 1: We use a massive open-source fMRI dataset to chart the prevalence of static conjunction coding through-
out the human visual system, using a method we developed in preliminary analyses.
Aim 2: We apply “synthetic neurophysiology” to feedforward artiﬁcial neural networks to understand how static
conjunction coding emerges in a feedforward hierarchy, beginning by characterizing conjunction-tuned units iden-
tiﬁed in preliminary analyses, followed by testing inﬂuential models for how this occurs in biological vision.
Aim 3: We test whether feedforward artiﬁcial neural networks exhibit similar limitations on a visual search task
compared to known results for human feedforward vision, followed by testing whether introducing recurrent con-
nections to networks can overcome these limitations."
10809689,"SUMMARY
CAR-T immunotherapy has great promise as a salvage regimen for patients who will no longer respond to
conventional therapies. Five CAR-T cell therapies (four targeting CD19 on cancer cells) have been approved
by FDA for treatment of relapsed and/or refractory (r/r) B-lineage malignancies, including ALL, Non-Hodgkin
Lymphoma, CLL and multiple myeloma. However, about 50% of B cell leukemia and lymphoma patients
treated with CD19 CAR-T therapy relapse within a year after CAR-T therapy. The success of CAR-T therapy
has been associated with several factors, including: 1) the initial expansion of CAR-T cells after transfer into
the patients in an IL-2-deprived environment, 2) maintenance of the CAR-T cell effector function 3) long-term
survival of CAR-T cells. These T cell biology aspects are highly influence by their metabolic stage, and CAR-T
cell outcome is known to be influenced by their metabolism. Metabolism is now considered as a major
regulatory factor of the function of immune cells and influences the course of an immune response. We have
identified MCJ (Methylation-Controlled J protein) as a protein localized in the inner membrane of mitochondria
that acts as an endogenous negative regulator of Complex I and mitochondrial respiration (mitochondrial ATP
production). We have shown that loss of MCJ in CD8 cells enhances cytokine secretion as well as cytotoxic
activity. Memory MCJ KO CD8 cells have superior protective activity against influenza virus. MCJ deficient
CD8 cells are also more efficient in killing tumor cells. Thus, we hypothesize that eliminating MCJ as a
metabolic brake in CD8 cells will result in enhanced cytokine production, tumor killing activity and survival of
CAR-T cells and that MCJ could be an attractive target to improve the success of CAR-T immunotherapy. To
test this hypothesis and show its clinical relevance, we propose: 1) to evaluate the role of MCJ as a regulator
of mitochondrial metabolism and effector function in human CD8 cells; 2) to evaluate the in vitro and vivo
potency and efficacy of mouse MCJ-deficient CAR T cells, 3) to develop an MCJ-deficient human CD8 CAR-T
with improved survival, expansion and cytotoxic activity."
10809695,"There is no licensed vaccine for humans against potentially life-threatening paratyphoid and nontyphoidal
septicemia caused by the Salmonella enterica. This intracellular pathogen evades sophisticated host immune
defenses. The host immune system is controlled by regulatory mechanisms, such as intercellular communication
between infected and uninfected cells, which can also be accomplished via small extracellular vesicles (EVs),
exosomes. Exosomes are vesicles that originate in the endosomal pathway and transport cargo to other cells.
We found that exosomes carry bacterial antigens (Ags) from S. Typhimurium-infected macrophages (
MΦ
s) and
stimulate naïve antigen-presenting cells involved in T cell recruitment, and an intranasal administration of these
exosomes leads to the production of anti-S. Typhimurium antibodies (Abs) and stimulation of Th 1 response
critical for engulfing and killing intracellular bacteria. These adaptive responses are Ags-dependent, but the Ags
responsible for this humoral response or the mechanisms responsible for Ag trafficking to EVs are unknown. We
will address the contribution of exosomes to adaptive immune responses against intracellular pathogens as there
is a critical need to determine new mechanisms of protective immune responses, such as exosome-modulated
immunity. Our long-term goal is to advance the development of mechanism-based preventative measures for
bacterial infections. Our overall objective is to elucidate the mechanisms whereby bacterial Ags are trafficked to
exosomes and identify the capability of exosomes to generate protective cellular and humoral immunity against
intracellular Salmonella. Our central hypothesis is that Salmonella Ags are trafficked to endosomal
compartments of infected MΦs and released via exosomes to stimulate innate responses and Ag-specific
Th1
cell responses
. The rationale is that determining the mechanisms via which Salmonella Ags are trafficked to
exosomes and generate adaptive immunity against Salmonella, we will assign a novel role of EVs in host
defense, important for the design of preventative approaches. In Aim 1, we will identify mechanisms whereby
Salmonella Ags are trafficked into EVs. In Aim 2, we will determine the mechanisms by which EVs produced by
Salmonella-infected
determine how EVs
MΦ
s regulate the activation and function of DCs in mucosal tissues. In Aim 3, we will
derived from Salmonella-infected
MΦ
s drive adaptive immunity. The expected outcomes
are that we will have established a mechanism responsible for the trafficking of Ags into EVs, and characterize
novel roles of EVs in innate immunity and Th1 adaptive immunity. This study will have a positive impact as it will
provide a conceptual framework for the future development of targets for vaccine design and significantly
advance knowledge of how Salmonella disrupts host immunity, which is vital for the development of preventative
and therapeutic approaches against this pathogen. The innovation lies in addressing the function of EVs
produced by host cells in rendering protection against salmonellosis. This study is significant since we will
advance knowledge on the function of host exosomes in altering the immune response to Salmonella infection."

β cell dysfunction is critical for the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Studies suggested that
over-nutrition and inflammation induce profound changes in the transcriptome and the epigenome of beta cells,
resulting in impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and loss of beta cell mass. However, the molecular
mechanisms of the epigenetic regulation in beta cell function and failure remain largely unclear. Our recent
results suggest that SIRT7, a NAD+-dependent deacetylase, regulate the glucose-stimulated insulin secretion
(GSIS), and antagonize inflammation- and overnutrition-induced islet dysfunction. We found that SIRT7
activates the expression of a number of key genes in the insulin synthesis and secretion pathways, while
suppresses the inflammatory and metabolic stress-induced transcription. These results raise the possibility that
SIRT7 simultaneously activates GSIS pathway, and represses stress-induced inflammatory responses,
through diverge molecular mechanisms. SIRT7 interacts with PBRM1, a chromatin remodeler, which controls
the chromatin accessibility of regulatory cis-elements associated with the GSIS pathway genes. On the other
hand, SIRT7 deacetylates H3K18Ac, a histone marks highly enriched in stress-induced promoter/enhancers in
beta cells. In addition, the ability and specificity of SIRT7 to repress targets is regulated by the intracellular
level of NAD+, and its interacting partner, vitamin D receptor (VDR), respectively. We hypothesize that SIRT7
is an essential regulator of insulin secretion and stress responses in beta cells through integrating NAD+ and
vitamin D signaling at the chromatin level. Accordingly, Specific Aim 1 will utilize novel genetic loss-of-function
mouse models to test the hypothesis that SIRT7 promotes insulin secretion through recruiting PBRM1 and
maintaining the chromatin accessibility. Specific Aim 2 will use multiple diabetes mouse models, to determine
the molecular underpinnings of SIRT7 in antagonizing stress-induced transcription in beta cells, through
deacetylating H3K18Ac and acting as a novel co-repressor of VDR. Lastly, Aim 3 will dissect the converge of
NAD+-SIRT7 and vitamin D-VDR signaling at the chromatin level, and test the therapeutic potential of co-
activating SIRT7-VDR to antagonize both mouse and human islet dysfunction. The proposed project will reveal
novel molecular regulatory mechanisms of beta cell function in healthy and dysfunctional state and may lead to
novel strategies for the development of next generation anti-diabetic therapies directly targeting β cell
dysfunction."

Congenital malformations, or birth defects, are the leading cause of death of American children under the age
of nine. Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common and devastating congenital malformations,
and result from a failure of the neural tube to close during early embryonic development. Neural tube closure
requires not only that the paired neural folds raise and fuse together, but also that the neuroectoderm
(precursor to the neural tube), narrows sufficiently for the neural folds to meet along the midline. This critical
narrowing begins during gastrulation and is coupled to a concurrent anteroposterior (AP) extension of the
neuroectoderm that results from the polarized rearrangement of cells into a longer and narrower array. This
process, appropriately termed convergence & extension (C&E), is a highly conserved morphogenetic
mechanism with essential roles in shaping numerous embryonic tissues and establishing the animal body plan.
Neural tube closure and extension of the primary AP embryonic axis are driven by C&E of both the
neuroectoderm and the underlying mesoderm, each of which exhibits a distinct suite of cell behaviors and
contributes actively to axis extension. It remains poorly understood, however, how tissue identity is coordinated
with tissue-specific cell behavior programs.
 Here, we address the tissue-specific morphogenesis underlying axis extension in zebrafish, a model
vertebrate embryo. We recently reported that the TGF- family morphogen Nodal is not only necessary for
C&E gastrulation movements in zebrafish, but also sufficient to promote these cell behaviors in otherwise
naïve zebrafish embryonic explants. By varying the method of Nodal signaling activation, we can drive tissue-
specific C&E of either the neuroectoderm or mesoderm within these explants. Importantly, this allows us to
uncouple morphogenesis of individual tissue layers and distinguish the mechanisms that control cell identity
from those that control cell movement. Each mode of C&E is associated with a specific developmental peak of
Nodal activity and transcriptional profile, leading us to hypothesize that temporal patterns of Nodal activity
define tissue-specific morphogenesis via distinct downstream molecular programs. Using cutting-edge
optogenetic approaches to precisely manipulate Nodal activity, experiments proposed in Aim 1 will test how
variations in temporal signaling dynamics control tissue-specific C&E both in and ex vivo. In Aims 2 and 3, we
will define the specific components of each Nodal-dependent gene expression program that are necessary
and/or sufficient for tissue-specific C&E of the mesoderm and neuroectoderm, respectively. This proposal
leverages the unique advantages of our innovative explant model and optogenetic approaches to identify
genes with novel roles in axis extension, thereby advancing a fundamental understanding of neural tube
closure essential for improved diagnosis, prevention, and treatment strategies for NTDs."

properties of serum and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) elicited by vaccinations. In Projects 1-3,
Drs. Bjorkman, Hahn, Shaw, and Nussenzweig will make regular use of Core A-produced
recombinant proteins and automated assays carried out on two Tecan Freedom Evo automated
liquid handling stations for the characterization of Env immunogens and Abs from immunized
mice, rabbits, and rhesus macaques (RMs). In addition, the availability of a Berkeley Lights
Beacon Instrument at Caltech to Core A will allow Caltech, UPenn, and Rockefeller labs to rapidly
conduct single B cell assays to assess degrees of Ab cross-reactivity across heterologous Envs
and clone sequences of cross-reactive Abs. The specific aims of Core A are to use high-
throughput methods for: (Aim 1) Expression and purification of mAbs, Env immunogens, and
protein nanoparticles; (Aim 2) Evaluating binding and affinities of Env immunogens for Abs; (Aim
3) Evaluating the potency and breadth of Abs derived from vaccination studies to neutralize
primary strains of HIV-1; and (Aim 4) Conducting B cell characterization and Ab discovery using
a Berkeley Lights Beacon instrument. The Protein Expression and Automated Assays Core
will be directed by Dr. Jost Vielmetter, an expert in protein expression, automated assay
development, and data management. Dr. Kate Malecek, the director of Caltech’s Beacon facility,
will supervise Beacon-related projects. Core A will maintain two custom-equipped Evo Freedom
Liquid handling stations, a surface plasmon resonance instrument with high-throughput
capabilities, and the Berkeley Lights Beacon instrument. Core A personnel will validate, refine,
and trouble-shoot protocols for automated protein expression, binding, in vitro neutralization
assays, Beacon isolation of single B cells from immunized animals, and perform assays for
evaluating Abs and Env proteins for Projects 1-3. The core will also train and assist students,
postdoctoral fellows, research assistants, and investigators in the analysis and interpretation of
data from automated assays, keeping track of projects using a cloud-based Notebook application
(Evernote), allowing all researchers to access data and experimental details in real time."

An effective HIV-1 vaccine likely requires induction of Abs against HIV-1 Env that neutralize across the majority
of circulating viral strains (i.e., broadly neutralizing antibodies; bNAbs). Because administered bNAbs are
protective against HIV-1 infection in animal models, it is widely believed that a vaccine that elicits bNAbs would
prevent infection. HIV-1 vaccine candidates generally target a single bNAb precursor lineage or epitope.
However, a protective HIV-1 vaccine likely requires inducing multiple bNAb lineages and/or bNAbs targeting
multiple epitopes on HIV-1 Env. We engineered three immunogens based on soluble native-like Env trimers
multimerized on protein nanoparticles, which together allow us to make priming immunogens to induce multiple
bNAb lineages against three epitopes: (1) RC1, targeting the V3-glycan patch; (2) IGT2, to elicit two classes of
CD4bs bNAbs; and (3) 3nv.2, a triple immunogen targeting the V3, CD4bs, and V1V2 epitopes. In our current
HIVRAD, the Bjorkman and Nussenzweig labs showed that these immunogens target intended epitopes and
elicit heterologously neutralizing Ab responses in both inferred germline (iGL) transgenic mice and wildtype (wt)
animals with polyclonal Ab repertoires. In addition, we demonstrated a boosting regimen using 3nv.2 as a prime
elicits more broad and potent Ab responses compared to a counterpart single epitope immunogen. Although
epitope mapping studies demonstrated Ab targeting of desired epitopes after a priming immunization, successive
boosting immunizations resulted in increasing elicitation of off-target Abs. This work provides a scaffold upon
which to improve GL targeting of bNAb precursor lineages and epitopes (Aim 1) and boosting regimens (Aims
2-4). We will improve Ab responses by applying boosting regimens designed through understanding viral
evolution from elicited Ab pressures are required to shepherd primed Ab responses to mature into potent bNAbs.
To design boosting regimens, we will use Env sequence information from two approaches in Aims 2 & 3: Aim 2
(with Drs. Hahn and Shaw): Immunogen immunized and then SHIV-infected rhesus macaques (RMs); Aim 3:
In vitro evolution assays. In addition, in Aim 4 (with Dr. Nussenzweig), we will design immunization regimens
using information from their studies aimed at mitigating impaired boosting from epitope-blocking Abs elicited by
a germline (GL)-targeting immunogen. In summary, the specific aims for Project 1 are: (Aim 1) Improve our V3,
CD4bs, and V3/CD4bs/V1V2 priming immunogens, (Aim 2) Improve boosting immunogens using viral evolution
data from RMs infected with GL-targeted and lineage-maturing SHIVs, (Aim 3) Use in vitro selection results to
engineer boosting immunogens to mimic Env evolution during infection, and (Aim 4) Investigate the effects of
epitope-targeting Abs to block a desired epitope during boosting."

California State University, Dominguez Hills (CSUDH), a public 4-year, Hispanic- and Minority-serving
institution, home to a diverse community of learners and educators, proposes to offer a well-structured U-RISE
program that will provide personalized guidance, organization, and support for its scholars by “meeting each
student where they are” through individual student-centric approach. The proposed program leverages
successes of various previously funded NIH MARC-USTAR and RISE programs at CSUDH and draws upon
relevant current academic interventions in the literature to offer a personalized, well-structured training plan to
prepare students for future biomedical or behavioral science research workforce. The specific aims of the
proposed U-RISE program at CSUDH are:
 Aim 1. U-RISE Scholars Performance. Offer a personalized and well-structured program that will
facilitate acceptance into and completion of a Ph.D. program in biomedical or behavioral science.
 Aim 2. Impact on other CSUDH Students. Involve non-U-RISE CSUDH students in relevant activities
to foster interest in pursuing Ph.D. degrees in biomedical and behavioral sciences.
 Aim 3. Program Dissemination and Showcasing. Share best practices and results nationally;
strengthen both intramural and extramural U-RISE program’s visibility to motivate other students to follow this
path and to promote building institutional capacity.
Based on prior RISE program outcomes, we project a minimum success rate of about 60%–65% scholars
entering Ph.D. programs by the end of the U-RISE cycle covered by this proposal. This number is significant
considering that many of our scholars are first generation college students who do not have role models who
have gone on to biomedical or behavioral science research careers. However, we are confident that our
proposed project has the structure and personalized attention that will lead us to exceed the projected success
rate. Overall, the U-RISE program at CSUDH (Fall 2020 enrollment of 17,763) will impact its cohort of students
directly and other students in U-RISE related disciplines indirectly by empowering a highly diverse pool of
undergraduates to first complete their bachelor’s degree, then transition into—and, finally, complete—
research-focused advanced degree programs in the biomedical or behavioral sciences."
10802304,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tissue engineered vascular grafts (TEVGs) have demonstrated potential to revolutionize cardiovascular care,
with multiple grafts now in clinical trials in children and adults. Yet, there remains a pressing need to optimize
these grafts to improve outcomes and enable wide-spread usage. In this proposal, we build upon a strong
foundation of prior findings but introduce an innovative multi-fidelity computational-experimental approach that
promises to accelerate greatly the development of improved TEVGs. Although the proposed approach is general
with broad applicability, we will focus on one particular application – TEVGs for congenital heart surgery – to
refine the approach and illustrate its utility. Specifically, we will use a pre-clinical juvenile ovine model to collect
the longitudinal data needed to develop and inform novel multiscale computational models that will be melded
to describe the in vivo development of a neovessel from an implanted biodegradable polymeric scaffold. Our
approach will be informed by data from three initial, non-optimal designs, then used to identify via formal methods
of optimization preferred microstructural scaffold parameters and an overall geometry that optimizes in vivo
function. Particularly novel will be our ability to account for normal developmental changes in the lamb
vasculature and coupling of cell signaling, growth and remodeling, and 3D hemodynamics in a novel multi-fidelity,
multiscale workflow that allows optimization of desired biological and physiological outcomes. To achieve these
goals, we propose three Specific Aims: 1) To quantify normal vascular development and performance of three
baseline TEVG designs in a lamb model; 2) To develop and employ a novel multiscale fluid-solid-growth (FSG)
simulation framework to optimize TEVG design; 3) To validate the model-identified optimal TEVG design in a
longitudinal large animal study. Our team is uniquely positioned for success, combining expertise in animal
models of congenital heart disease, development of TEVGs and their clinical translation, finite element
simulations of cardiovascular hemodynamics and biomechanics, modeling vascular growth and remodeling, and
identifying and modeling mechanisms of mechanobiology. Our approach is innovative in that we will 1) meld
macro (organ) level simulations of cardiovascular biomechanics with micro level simulations of vascular cell
signaling, 2) develop a novel, generally applicable paradigm for model-driven optimization of tissue engineered
structures that provides control over outcomes, and 3) facilitate clinical translation of TEVGs with improved
performance. Successful completion of this study will be significant in multiple ways – not only will it result in a
new (optimal) design of a TEVG for use in the Fontan surgical procedure, performed in children born with single
ventricle congenital heart defects, it will also establish a novel computational-experimental paradigm in
cardiovascular tissue engineering that promises to accelerate the development of diverse implants."

fosters research on basic mechanisms of DNA repair, mutagenesis, and environmental epigenetics and
application of this knowledge to understanding human health effects from environmental exposures. Studies of
DNA repair, mutagenesis, and epigenetics by EMGS scientists are integrated with research on inherited and
acquired genetic alterations that predispose individuals to cancer, premature aging, neurodegenerations and
birth defects. Fundamental understanding of the mechanisms and consequences of cellular, tissue, whole
organism, and human population responses to genotoxic agents is crucial to informed regulatory decision-
making with respect to environmental health hazards. The integration of multi-disciplinary basic and applied
research is essential to this process. Such integration remains the central focus of the EMGS, and the annual
meetings are key to the dissemination of information and fostering the necessary interactions. In addition,
meetings provide an important forum for students and new/early stage investigators to present their research
and to interact with leading scientists in their field in a setting that encourages open exchange of ideas. The 54th
Annual Meeting of the EMGS will be held in Chicago, IL. from September 9-13, 2023. The theme is “EMGS in
the Windy City: Billowing the Sails of DNA Science”, encompassing areas of current research that converge on
the issues of environmental exposure, how cells and organisms respond to such challenges, and how this
information can be applied to promote human health in the era of high-throughput data. The themes for the 55th

Follicular lymphoma (FL) is an indolent form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, that arises from B
lymphocytes and accounts for ~25% of NHL cases that is presently considered an incurable disease.
Intratumoral application [to within diseased lymph nodes (LNs)] of immunotherapy drugs when used in
combination with radiation therapy potently induces the abscopal effect, which is an attractive approach
given the systemic nature of FL. However, given the toxicity risks of radiation therapy and invasive
nature of intratumoral drug administration, new therapeutic approaches are crucially needed. The
objective of this R01 program is to develop and validate a temporally controlled, two-stage drug delivery
technology targeting lymphoma-bearing LNs for FL therapy. This will be tested in a rigorous preclinical
model of Bcl6 and EZH2-driven lymphoma which is an animal model that most closely resembles
human disease. Three aims are proposed:
 Aim 1: LN delivery and effects of immune stimulatory agents.
 Aim 2: LN delivery and effects of drugs inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD).
 Aim 3: Combined delivery of immune stimulatory and ICD-inducing agents in the Bcl6-EZH2
 lymphoma model.
This project is expected to yield several outcomes. First, these studies will define parameters for
enhancing the efficacy of FL therapy via LN drug targeting. Second, the potential for LN-targeted
therapy to improve the abscopal effect in the treatment of FL will be established. Therapeutic agents
already in human clinical testing or approved for human use will be investigated in this work to ensure
the highest potential for rapid clinical translation."

10816525,"Project Summary/Abstract
Most senior design courses in Biomedical Engineering (BME) challenge students with the task of creating
engineered solutions to unsolved clinical problems. This experience, however, is often the first time in the
curriculum that students are exposed to needs finding, communicating with clinicians, following an engineering
process to generate innovative solutions, and incorporating user feedback. Through the proposed activities, we
will introduce clinical innovation experiences earlier in the curriculum so that BME students enter their capstone
year as experienced innovators. We will capitalize on existing partnerships between medicine, engineering and
business in design, innovation, and entrepreneurship to form an early interdisciplinary BME education that
fosters more experienced and creative biomedical engineers well into the 21st century. Three specific
opportunities for strategic enhancement of the BME undergraduate experience at UAB have been identified.
First, there is a need to create a cohesive experience for BME underclassmen, as student exposure to BME
faculty and content is limited in the first two years. Secondly, there is a large gap in time between the early design
courses and the senior capstone, during which exposure to clinical problems is sparse, and design/innovation
are not emphasized. Thirdly, there is a need for higher level engineering design activities in the capstone
experience. The objective of the present proposal will be met through three aims. The first aim is to introduce to
clinical innovation and design thinking to freshmen and sophomores by providing needs finding opportunities in
a clinical setting and guiding them toward development of solutions to clinical problems in a classroom setting.
In the second aim, ten rising BME juniors will take part in a 10-week summer clinical immersion in which they
will perform needs finding and customer discovery surrounding medical/assistive devices or processes, develop
a preliminary design/prototype, and create a business model. A faculty team will screen their output for use in
the upcoming senior design course. The third aim is to enhancement the senior capstone experience by
accelerating the project selection process and teaching best design practices during the first semester. In the
second semester, new online modules covering business topics will free up valuable class time for advanced
engineering topics and design activities that will improve student learning outcomes and increase the potential
for novel, patentable designs. In addition, we will launch a new effort with the UAB Office of Disability Support
Services (DSS) to recruit students with disabilities into our undergraduate program. People with disabilities
represent a powerful stakeholder and given our record of accomplishment for product development in this space,
this activity will serve to improve overall success and involve an underserved constituent in engineering."
10816526,"We will determine the utility of a novel brain mapping technique for epilepsy presurgical evaluation, referred to
as 'six-dimensional (6D) dynamic tractography'. This innovative program animates the rapid neural propagations
along MRI-defined, 3D white matter tracts that connect regions supporting cognitive functions. Specifically, it will
use event-related high gamma activity to localize the regions supporting specific linguistic functions and compute
the velocity and strength of neural propagations based on the latency and amplitude of early neural responses
to single-pulse electrical stimulation. We expect that considering both the negative effect of damaged white
matter tracts and the positive effect of seizure control will help optimize the model's performance in predicting
postoperative language outcomes; this will be accomplished by incorporating the 6D dynamic tractography and
objective epilepsy biomarkers, including spontaneous high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) coupled to slow-waves,
into our predictive model. By also identifying and considering the physiological high gamma augmentation strictly
time-locked to stimuli and behaviors, our innovative intracranial EEG analysis will better distinguish the randomly-
occurring pathologic HFOs. Another significant advancement provided by our model is its independence of
conventional electrical stimulation mapping, which can acutely elicit seizures and fail to satisfactorily localize
language areas in certain patient subsets. Additionally, this project will use 6D dynamic tractography to provide
an explicit neurobiological model of language network dynamics, allowing us to tease apart the specific pathways
originating from temporal lobe cortices that support the lexical retrieval of auditory or visual domains. Our prior
project indicated that the arcuate fasciculus fibers support the direct transfer of lexical representations of auditory
sentences. We will now determine whether the lexical representations of visual objects are likewise transferred
via the arcuate fasciculus or others, including the fusiform-parietal fasciculus. To accomplish these goals, this
project will prospectively recruit a new cohort of 80 epilepsy patients - age range: 0.5 to 21 years - undergoing
extraoperative intracranial EEG recording and subsequent resective surgery. Finally, we will determine if the
human brain creates and strengthens language-related functional parcellations throughout development. It has
been suggested that the adult brain efficiently activates the posterior superior-temporal gyrus (STG) only during
sound onset to decode the boundary between sounds. In contrast, the anterior STG shows sustained activation
during an auditory stimulus to encode the phonetic features. We will determine if such a functional parcellation
is more evident in older individuals, whose brains are more developed. While providing hypotheses focusing on
specific brain regions, we will perform all of the proposed analyses at the whole-brain level. We will make all data
and codes publicly available to facilitate external validation and implementation."

10820403,"Influenza virus is a major pathogen causing seasonal epidemics of disease in the world. Airway epithelium
acts as the first line of host antiviral defense. Influenza virus-induced innate immunity plays a critical role in viral
clearance. However, if uncontrolled, dysregulated innate immune responses contribute significantly to the
morbidity and mortality. Therefore, influenza virus-induced innate immune responses must be tightly regulated.
The molecular mechanisms underlying the tight regulation of influenza virus-induced innate immunity remain
largely unknown. Currently available influenza vaccines and antiviral drugs have a limited impact on influenza
virus infection due to the mismatches between the vaccine strains and the circulating strains as well as newly
emerging mutant viruses and drug-resistant virus strains. There is an urgent need for developing innovative
therapeutic strategies for improving innate immunity. Our long-term goal is to elucidate the molecular
mechanisms underlying the tight regulation of host innate immune responses in influenza virus infection and
identify novel therapeutic targets. In contrast to the relatively well-studied positive regulators such as RIG-I like
receptor (RLR) in regulating antiviral response, the molecular mechanisms, in particular the negative regulators,
involved in the tight regulation of host antiviral innate immune responses still remain largely unknown. Pirin, a
key signaling regulatory protein, has been shown to be involved in cancer and fibrosis. Its role in infectious
diseases, in particular in regulating host innate immune responses remains unclear. Our encouraging preliminary
data suggest that Pirin may negatively regulate influenza virus-induced innate immunity in Adenosine
Deaminases Acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1)- and phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1)-dependent manners in airway
epithelial cells in vitro and in the mouse models of influenza virus infection. Moreover, Pirin is highly expressed
in lung, especially in airway epithelium, and Pirin depletion improves anti-viral innate immune responses, viral
clearance and host survival. Together, these exciting preliminary data have thus laid a solid foundation for us to
hypothesize that [1] Pirin acts as a key negative regulator for influenza virus-induced innate immunity in airway
epithelium; [2] Pirin inhibits influenza virus-induced innate immunity via (1) interacting with ADAR1, and Pirin-
ADAR1 signaling axis inhibits RIG-I-dependent anti-viral innate immune response via negatively cross-talking
with Ras-related Nuclear protein (RAN), a positive regulator of anti-viral response and (2) inhibiting PGK1, a
positive regulator, in influenza virus infection (hypothesis). To test our hypothesis, we will pursue three specific
aims to determine (Aim 1) the role of Pirin in airway epithelium in influenza virus infection and its therapeutic
potential; (Aim 2 & 3) the molecular mechanisms underlying negative regulation of antiviral innate immunity by
Pirin via ADAR1-dependent negative cross-talk with RAN (Aim 2) and inhibiting PGK1 (Aim 3). These studies
may not only significantly advance our understanding of the negative regulation of innate immunity but may also
lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets for treating influenza virus infections."
10819476,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Large-scale genomic studies of human tumors have uncovered a series of characteristic “mutation signatures”;
i.e., statistically enriched patterns of DNA substitutions and rearrangements common across tumors. While
some of these signatures are associated with particular cancer subtypes, known genotoxic insults, and/or
rough mutational patterns arising from specific DNA repair defects, most remain uncharacterized without
known biological correlates. To determine the mechanisms by which mutation signatures arise, we will initially
focus on triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) with lesions in the BRCA1 tumor suppressor pathway. Recent
studies have identified at least five distinct mutation signatures in TNBCs. However, we do not know if
additional signatures exist, nor do we understand the molecular mechanisms by which these signatures are
generated. BRCA1 acts to preserve genome integrity through multiple processes, including homology-directed
repair (HDR) and stalled fork protection (SFP), and it does so in association with a number of distinct protein
partners. Thus, the mutation signatures associated with TNBC may reflect the loss of particular BRCA1
pathway functions and/or defects in other as yet unidentified DNA repair factors. To address these issues, we
will combine expertise in computation analysis of genomic data and the molecular biology of DNA repair to 1)
elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible for TNBC mutation signatures, and 2) determine the full
spectrum of mutation signatures associated with TNBC patients bearing pathogenic lesions in the BRCA1
pathway."
10785043,"Project Summary:
Aging is the primary diver of neurodegenerative disease (ND), yet the etiology often remains elusive. Intriguingly,
transient neuroinflammation (e.g. from acute infection) is a risk factor for developing ND decades later. This
phenomenon has remained largely unexplored at the cellular and molecular level. My K99/R00 study focuses
on the role of astrocytes in this process, a cell type that is often perceived as an inert neural support cell, however,
they are essential for nervous system development, function, and regeneration, and have many parallels with
innate immune cells. Research including my own reveals that astrocytes respond to neuroinflammation and
injury with context-dependent molecular and functional changes referred to as “astrocyte reactivity”. In addition,
we observed that astrocyte reactivity is mediated through substantial epigenetic changes, however, if these
alterations are persistent after insult resolution is unclear. Indeed, if, or how, astrocyte reactivity resolves; and
how transient astrocyte reactivity affects future insults remains unexplored. I propose a novel concept that:
transient neuroinflammation results in long-lasting reactive astrocyte memory (RAM) – characterized by durable
epigenetic changes, which allow for rapid gene alteration upon a subsequent insult. During aging, RAM can be
inappropriately activated and contribute to ND onset and pathology. In this way, the astrocyte's response would
mimic trained immunity described in the peripheral myeloid lineage where transient insults impart long-lasting
“inflammatory memories” encoded by epigenetic changes. This inflammatory memory lowers the threshold for
subsequent insults and enhances the cellular response. However, during aging, trained immunity can be
inappropriately activated and contribute to pathologies such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. The objective
of the current study is to establish the novel concept of RAM; determine the functional consequences of RAM in
Alzheimer's disease (AD); and dissect the molecular mechanisms underpinning RAM. In Aim1 I will use mouse
models of acute neuroinflammation and matched transcriptomic and epigenomic sequencing to define RAM with
molecular precision. In Aim 2 I will use a mouse model of AD to functionally test the contribution of RAM to AD
onset and progression. Finally, in Aim 3, I will determine the molecular mechanisms required for RAM formation,
maintenance and recall by using astrocyte-specific gene knockdown methodology. This research will pioneer
the concept and understanding of RAM and its role in ND. Data from this study can direct new therapeutics
aimed at attenuating the maladaptive effects of neuroinflammation to limit ND pathology. This a critical goal for
the future of medicine given the aging population and increasing global prominence of ND."

Craniofacial deformity often involves cranial sutures. Adequate understanding of the molecular mechanism
underlying cranial suture development is urgently demanded for exploring new diagnostic and therapeutic
methods for cranial diseases, such as craniosynostosis and sutural agenesis. Neural crest cells (NCCs) are a
multipotent stem cell population, and make great contributions to cranial suture development, especially frontal
(metopic) suture, which is derived from NCCs. The long-term objective of this K99/R00 application is to develop
Dr. Xiaolei Zhao's capability to conduct studies aimed at dissecting and mapping the molecular mechanism
underlying cranial suture development, to explore novel and critical factors for the diagnosis and treatment of
cranial suture diseases. In the K99 phase, the proposed studies support Dr. Zhao in four training goals which
will allow her to learn more skills and transition to an independent investigator, who focuses on studying the
complicated molecular mechanism of how cranial suture is orchestrated during craniofacial development. First,
she will obtain training in iPSCs, which will allow her to explore and validate the molecular mechanism in human
cells. Second, she will learn how to analyze the large datasets, such as single cell RNA-seq and CUT&RUN,
using bioinformatics techniques to fully understand and analyze the sequencing results. Third, she will extend
her knowledge in craniofacial field to comprehensively understand the craniofacial development and disease as
well as the potential molecular regulation. Finally, Dr. Zhao will engage in career training for professional
development, especially in the writing, mentoring and collaboration.
Dr. Zhao's pilot data discovered a crosstalk between two fundamental pathways, FGF and Hippo-Yap pathway,
in NCC-derived suture, which had not been reported up to date. Her data also revealed the potential functions
of the crosstalk in stemness and differentiation of NC-derived suture cells. To further dissect the potential and
novel molecular mechanism underlying cranial suture development, which could potentially contribute to the
discovery of critical factors for the diagnosis and treatment of cranial suture diseases, Dr. Zhao proposed 3
research aims in this application as follows. In Aim 1, she evaluates the functions of FGF signaling in stemness
and differentiation of NCC-derived suture cells, and investigates if the Hippo signaling downstream effectors,
Yap and Taz, are required for the functions of FGF signaling. In Aim 2, she proposes to validate the molecular
interaction between Yap/Taz and FGF signaling downstream effectors, p-ERK1/2, which was shown in her pilot
data, er vivo and in vivo, and detect how p-ERK1/2 affect Yap and Taz activity. In Aim 3, she further dissects the
population and function of suture mesenchymal stem cells (SMSCs) in NC-derived frontal suture at single cell
level, and how SMSCs are coordinately regulated by FGF and Hippo-Yap pathways. Through comprehensive
analysis, she expects to discover novel and critical factors for cranial suture development and diseases."

Genetic disruption of DNA polymerase theta (Polθ) activity has been shown to effectively target BRCA1 mutated
cells, while leaving BRCA1 wild-type (WT) cells intact. Polθ facilitates theta-mediated DNA end joining (TMEJ)
repair by promoting DNA synapsis and repair synthesis at break sites containing 3' single stranded (ss)DNA
overhangs. Although small molecule inhibitors of Polθ activity are currently under development for the treatment
of BRCA1 mutant cancers, very little is known regarding the mechanisms that activate TMEJ and result in Polθ-
dependency in BRCA1 mutant cells. Moreover, the current paradigm assumes that homologous recombination
(HR)-deficiency confers Polθi sensitivity, therefore PARPi responsiveness is expected to be a biomarker for Polθ
inhibitor (Polθi) sensitivity. In our preliminary data, we unexpectedly identified commonly used Brca1 mutant
cells that grow relatively unperturbed with genetic Polq (Polθ) knockout (KO), indicating that Polθi and PARPi
sensitivity may not necessarily correlate. In this proposal, we will elucidate the molecular requirements for TMEJ
activation and identify biological factors that distinguish PARPi and Polθi sensitivity. We will address the following
Specific Aims: 1) reveal the molecular basis of TMEJ activation in Brca1 mutant cells; 2) uncover genetic Polθ-
dependencies in Brca1 mutant cells; and 3) examine pharmacologic Polθ inhibition in Brca1 mutant cells.
Collectively, these studies will be informative for future clinical studies employing Polθi."

Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) is a cancer whose principal therapies are associated with an increased risk for
cardiopulmonary complications and cerebrovascular disease when compared to sibling. Reduced
cardiopulmonary functional reserve and lung morbidity are associated with poor neurocognitive outcomes. The
pathophysiology of how HL treatment and cardiopulmonary complications are related to increased
cerebrovascular and neurocognitive risks are not well understood. We hypothesize that impaired regulation of
cerebral blood flow (CBF), which is primarily driven by oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the blood, is
caused by impaired gas diffusion in the lungs and reduced cardiopulmonary function and functional reserve.
The specific aims of this research are: 1) to evaluate how CBF and oxygenation change during exercise in
survivors compared to controls; 2) to examine if CO2 clearance differs in survivors compared to controls during
rest and exercise; and 3) to examine associations among CBF, reduced cardiopulmonary functional reserve,
cardiopulmonary function, and neurocognitive outcomes in HL survivors.
This study will utilize a cross-sectional assessment of community controls and adult survivors of HL who were
treated with bleomycin and/or chest and neck radiation. Participants will be recruited from the St. Jude Lifetime
Cohort (SJLIFE) study. As part of this study, they will undergo complete pulmonary function tests,
echocardiogram, and neurocognitive testing. In addition to this standard testing, CBF will be assessed
immediately prior to and during cardiopulmonary exercise using a wearable, near infrared spectroscopy
system. Participants will complete maximal (100% of predicted heart rate) cardiopulmonary exercise testing
with continuous 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring. Expired gas will be collected with a two-way non-
rebreather valve and monitored continuously using a breath-by-breath gas analysis system to evaluate
cardiopulmonary functional reserve and lung ventilation and gas diffusion measures. Demographic and
treatment factors will be compared to cardiopulmonary functional reserve outcomes. Gas diffusion
(ETCO2/DLCO) and CBF will be compared between HL survivors and community controls and identified
differences will be referenced to the chemotherapy, chest and neck radiation dose, pulmonary function test,
ECG, and neurocognitive testing. This study will improve our understanding of the relationship between
cardiopulmonary health and functional reserve, CBF regulation, and late-onset neurocognitive impairments in
HL survivors. This can be translated to improved screening and monitoring, and development of interventions
to reduce cancer related late-effects."

Health Equity Research and Outreach Network (HAWAI‘I HERON)” will create an Administrative Core to allow
us to quickly respond and participate in multi-institutional studies that support three health equity pillars: equity
of voices, equitable data efforts, and equity in clinical trials. First, we will enhance equity of voices by 1) amplifying
the voices of our AA-NHPI stakeholder communities; 2) understanding diverse patient perspectives, preferences,
and unmet needs; and 3) supporting expansion of culturally and linguistically tailored health education. Second,
we will support equitable data efforts by expanding capacity to evaluate outcomes by 1) race/ethnicity; 2)
geography; and 3) other social determinants of health. Third, we will promote equity in clinical trials by 1)
identifying barriers; 2) employing innovative strategies to increase clinical trial enrollment for AA-NHPI; 3)
understanding the impact of the evolving multicultural landscape on trial participation; and 4) increasing training
for diverse students and investigators. The HAWAI‘I HERON Administrative Core will foster collaboration with
the Food and Drug Administration Office of Minority Health and Health Equity and other institutions that are part
of the Racial & Ethnic Minority Acceleration Consortium for Health Equity (REACH) network. In addition, we will
leverage the Administrative Core to conduct a pilot study involving a discrete choice experiment examining AA-
NHPI perceptions and preferences for diabetes medications. We will gain an understanding of AA-NHPI
preferences regarding attributes of diabetes medications through administering patient preference surveys to 50
AA and 50 NHPI with type 2 diabetes. Random utility theory will serve as the basis for analysis. This assumes
that individuals make choices to maximize their utility (or wellbeing), which they derive from different choices.
Mixed logit regression, which allows for heterogeneity in preferences across individuals, will be used to estimate
the random utility models. Results will enable us to better understand the importance of different attributes and
levels, as well as willingness to trade-off between attributes. We will compare findings for AA to those of NHPI
and describe similarities and differences. Sensitivity analysis will be used to test the robustness of the results to
different assumptions and model specifications. We will hire and train a Health Equity Fellow to support the
discrete choice experiment in diabetes medications and build expertise and scholarship for future work and
engagement. Achievement of these aims will enable HAWAI‘I HERON to be an active partner to the FDA Office
of Minority Health and Health Equity in collaborative research efforts to advance minority health and health equity
focused research, to improve outreach and communications, and to support training and mentoring of diverse

 Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a lethal disease with a median survival of only 5-7 years.
Pathophysiologically, PAH is a progressive vasculopathy of the precapillary pulmonary vessels that increases
pulmonary arterial pressures and pulmonary vascular resistance while reducing pulmonary arterial compliance.
The changes in the pulmonary vasculature augment the work load of the right ventricle, which ultimately results
in right ventricular dysfunction (RVD). The presence of RVD is the greatest risk factor for death in PAH;
however, no current PAH therapies actually target the RV directly. In this proposal, we will investigate the
hypothesis that sex-differences in RV function in PAH are in-part mediated by an inhibitory action of estrogen
on microtubule dynamics. We will employ state of the art microscopy and computational analysis to define how
estrogen regulates microtubules. Then, in translational studies we will determine modulation of the estrogen-
microtubule interaction impacts right ventricular function in pre-clinical PAH using advanced hemodynamics
and molecular phenotyping of the RV microtubule cytoskeleton."
10825443,"Project Summary/Abstract
The objective of this proposal is to create dexterous steerable instrument sheaths that enable patients who
currently are subject to invasive surgeries to receive minimally invasive endoscopic interventions.
Clinical signiﬁcance comes from (1) the high incidence of colon lesions – there are 6.3 million colonoscopies
per year with 50% ﬁnding lesions, and (2) the difﬁculty of removing a subset of these (those with challenging
sizes, shapes, or locations) due to the limited dexterity of conventional endoscopes. This results in over 60,000
patients per year in the USA with colon lesions that the very best endoscopists have demonstrated can be safely
removed with an outpatient endoscopic procedure, who are instead subjected to invasive surgery to remove
a section of their colon (i.e. colectomy surgery). This occurs because of the dexterity gap between the best
endoscopists and typical endoscopists. We aim to close this gap with the new device described in this proposal.
The innovation in our work is a new steerable sheath concept that harnesses elastic asymmetry to provide
dexterity at the tip of a colonoscope. This dexterity reduces the difﬁculty of removing challenging lesions endo-
scopically. Our controllably deﬂectable, thin-walled, tube-like device will be small enough to pass through the
port of a conventional endoscope, while providing a large open lumen for surgical instruments to pass through.
Its innovative mechanical design accomplishes this by dispensing with conventional pull-wires, hinges, and other
bulky force transmission elements in favor of the push-pull interaction of two thin-walled tubes, which bend con-
trollably via interacting regions of stiffness asymmetry at their tips.
Our approach consists of three Speciﬁc Aims. Aim 1 addresses the construction of the steerable sheaths and
their actuation systems. Aim 2 focuses on enabling dexterous physician control via a physician interface console,
and optimization of device dexterity. Aim 3 consists of ex vivo and in vivo porcine experiments to demonstrate
that the device enables physicians new to endoscopic dissection to perform with accuracy and efﬁciency similar
to what elite endoscopists have shown can effectively and safely treat the 60,000 patients mentioned above. The
endpoint of this project will be a device that has been validated in an animal model, setting the stage for rapid
clinical translation after successful completion of this R01."
10824332,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The complexity of human splicing is daunting, yet intervention in splicing for treatment of diseases holds
huge potential. Based on strong preliminary results, we propose three areas of investigation that leverage our
group’s deep knowledge of splicing to address critical open questions, and to explore the potential for innovative
engineering. The first area addresses the mechanism by which U2 snRNP captures the intron branchpoint
early in spliceosome assembly, a step altered by recurrent cancer mutations and targeted in nature by
antibiotic-producing bacteria. Using new reporters in which two branchpoints compete for recognition, we have
identified a novel splicing fidelity mechanism we call “NO-BP decay,” in which U2 complexes that fail due to
aberrant branchpoint selection are destroyed. We will characterize this process, applying a battery of candidate
gene-based suppressor screens and biochemical tests in splicing extracts. The second area of investigation
addresses how splicing is integrated with transcription and cell growth at the individual gene and cellular
levels, an emerging area in need of innovation if splicing is to be successfully engineered. Preliminary results
indicate that yeast cells have a limited capacity for splicing that creates competition for pre-mRNAs that is critical
to cell function. We will measure both splicing capacity and the dynamics of competition, using RNA sequencing
to develop a predictive model that explains how splicing is coordinated at a systems level. To understand the
contribution of individual genes to this system we are applying synthetic biology approaches. We have
engineered site-specific pauses of RNA polymerase II and shown that they alter splicing efficiency and
alternative splicing, by unknown mechanism(s) that we will dissect. We will also explore in detail the role of
splicing noise (stochastic variations in splicing output over time) on the ability of splicing to control stable
homeostatic expression settings (as it does in many RNA binding protein genes) as well as to control a bistable
switch (as it does in the Drosophila Sex lethal gene). These experiments will define the operational principles of
simple splicing regulatory circuits. The third area of investigation is focused on the process of intron gain
and its roles in eukaryotic gene creation and gene diversification. Our recent discovery that the spliceosome
can convert the lariat intron to a true intron circle after splicing indicates that it can carry out reverse splicing
reactions in vivo, raising questions about whether and how it might promote formation of new introns. We
propose to test biochemical steps predicted to be necessary for spliceosome-mediated intron gain, and have
already set up experiments to document intron gain in vivo. Given the fundamental conservation of the splicing
machinery, this work promises to translate directly into new understanding of the mechanisms of gene regulation
in eukaryotes, including humans. Defects in splicing are frequently recognized as contributors to disease, and
interventions that address splicing defects are increasingly successful pathways to treatment."

The goals of the Administrative Core, located at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, are
to provide coordination and integration of all Projects and Cores across Northwestern, National Jewish and
University of Calgary, as well as dissemination of resources, primary data, and scientific results with the other
Cooperative Centers on Human Immunology and to the public. The Administrative Core will accomplish these
objectives as outlined in four specific aims: 1) To support communication between Project Investigators, Core
Leaders, other Cooperative Centers on Human Immunology Sites, and NIAID Program Staff. In addition, Core
A will organize quarterly executive committee hybrid meetings, host an annual in-person scientific meeting of our
multidisciplinary investigators, and will host an annual external advisory board review. 2) To provide a structure
for the distribution of common resources, and regulatory and budgetary oversight for Project Investigators and
Core Leaders. 3) To disseminate the discoveries made by Neu-Lung Consortium Investigators through support
of publications and presentations, and to implement sharing of materials, protocols and raw data to other
institutions and investigators, including NIAID-directed public databases/repositories. 4) To foster an
environment of collaborative interdisciplinary research and mentoring of students, post-doctoral fellows, and
investigators. Core A will be led by Dr. Stephanie Eisenbarth, an accomplished immunologist with expertise in
both innate and adaptive immunity, and the inaugural director of the new Center for Human Immunobiology (CHI)
at Northwestern. Core A will be supported by the expertise of Dr. G. R. Scott Budinger, Chief of Pulmonary and
Critical Care Medicine at Northwestern and CHI advisory board member, and an institutionally supported CHI
Research Program Coordinator. The primary mission of the CHI is to foster collaboration and provide resources
for immunology-focused investigators at Northwestern. As part of that mission, monthly faculty working groups
have been formed to identify scientific synergy amongst CHI labs. This proposal is a result of the “Innate
Immunity in the Lung” working group, which brings together immunologists with expertise in neutrophil biology,
lung pathology, and immune disease modeling. Core A will continue to foster the interactions of this group by
hosting monthly hybrid meetings, an annual in-person scientific meeting and oversight of this U19 if awarded.
The CHI at Northwestern will provide important resources for this proposal if funded as the breadth of human
immunology grows on campus and new initiatives to support trainees focused on human immunology are
implemented."
10825206,"The overarching goal of our CCHI application on “Vaccine and Infection Induced Immunity in the Young and
Aged” is to address fundamental issues about innate and adaptive immunity in humans to infection and
vaccination. Our proposal is focused around a large cohort of > 700 COVID-19 patients that we have been
following for the past 3 years and now propose to follow for an additional 5 years during the course of this
proposal. These patients were recruited at our two clinical research sites, Emory University (Atlanta, Georgia)
and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center (Seattle, Washington). Our combined cohort of > 700 patients consists of
individuals who were first infected with SARS-CoV-2 and then received the mRNA Pfizer or Moderna vaccine,
and some individuals who got the vaccine first and were then infected. Several of these individuals then had
booster shots and some also had breakthrough infections. During this 3 year period of multiple antigen
encounters we have collected on average between 5-10 blood samples from each patient. We now propose to
collect 3-4 samples/year from each patient for the next 5 years. The longitudinal assessment of innate, humoral
and cellular immunity in this large cohort over an 8 year period with 20-30 time points for each person will provide
an extraordinary and unprecedented look at the durability and evolution adaptive and innate immunity following
infection and vaccination. These studies will not only provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of innate
immunity and long-term immune memory but will also inform how we develop optimal vaccination strategies
against SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging viral infections. We have assembled a group of outstanding
investigators from five institutions with highly complementary expertise and organized our renewal application
along the following Projects and Cores: Project 1: Immune Memory: Drs. Rafi Ahmed and Julie McElrath; Project
2: Innate Immunity: Drs. Bali Pulendran and Donna Farber; Project 3: immune Senescence: Dr. Jorg Goronzy;
Core A: Administrative: Dr. Rafi Ahmed; Core B: Genomics Core: Drs. Steve Bosinger and William Greenleaf;
Core C: Clinical and Biostatistics: Drs. Sri Edupuganti, Julie McElrath, Max Lau, and Veronika Zarnitsyna. The
overall broad Aims of our CCHI program are as follows: Aim 1: Longitudinal analysis of T and B cell responses
to SARS-CoV-2. Aim 2: Innate Immunity with focus on functional and epigenetics changes in myeloid cells.
Aim 3: Effect of aging on SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses."

2026 (RFA-FD-23-027) to continue conformance and maintenance of the Manufactured
Food Regulatory Program Standards (MFRPS). Under state authority, PDA adopts most
of the specified CFR provisions as the regulations of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
which in turn are the regulations by which PDA enforces at manufactured food facilities
throughout the Commonwealth. Inspections are conducted following the best practices
as developed by the Partnership for Food Protection workgroup recommendations for

10825561,"An important unsolved question in cell death is to understand why different cells within a population vary in
their responses. Which cells will live or die and what determines exactly how they die after exposure to a
death stimulus? These questions underlie fundamental cell fate decisions and also have important practical
ramifications, for example, during cancer therapy when non-heritable, heterogeneous responses to anti-cancer
drugs underlie the eventual acquisition of resistance to therapy. Heterogeneity in cell responses can be driven
by stable genetic differences between cells, which are easy to understand. However, such differences also
occur even in genetically homogeneous cell populations. What underlies these differences? More important,
can we manipulate these effects? Previous work supported by this grant discovered that even in a
homogeneous population of cells under unstressed conditions, there is extensive variation in the amount of
autophagic flux, which in turn predicts the outcome to future treatment with a death stimulus. And, in the last
funding period, we discovered a specific mechanism by which autophagy controls the apoptosis threshold and
a quite different mechanism by which the autophagy machinery can control necroptosis. Building on these
previous studies, we hypothesize: autophagy controls apoptotic and necroptotic thresholds by regulating
Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Permeabilization (MOMP). And, this explains cell death variation between cells
in a population. We will test this hypothesis by completing the following aims using a variety of new
approaches including the first method that allows optogenetic regulation of autophagy. Specific Aim 1. Test if
autophagy variation before and after a death stimulus controls heterogeneity in apoptosis responses in a cell
population. Specific Aim 2. Determine how autophagy regulates necroptosis. By completing these aims, we
will gain new insights into the interplay between two major forms of programmed cell death (apoptosis and
necroptosis) and uncover how autophagy regulates these processes."

Well-characterized longitudinal epidemiological cohorts are crucial resources for identifying novel risk factors,
examining exposure-outcome associations, and determining the role of biomarkers in disease development and
progression. The Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW) is a unique environmental epidemiological cohort
where rigorous survey methodology was used to ensure state-wide participation from Wisconsin, resulting in a
representative sample. Based on our successful experience in participant recruitment, we propose to initiate
SHOW-Forward to further enhance diversity of the cohort, enrich already collected data and expand its access
to the research community to facilitate novel environmental epidemiology and translational research aligned with
the NIEHS mission. To accomplish these goals, we propose three specific aims. First, we will expand the SHOW
cohort through continued and enhanced outreach and engagement of underserved and underrepresented
populations in Wisconsin. Novel approaches for participant-centric biospecimen collection will be implemented
to reduce the burden for participants from rural areas with limited access to health care resources. Second, we
will develop the SHOW Real World Data Collaborative infrastructure as a foundation for secure integrative
environmental health research. Third, we will establish the administrative infrastructure to develop, refine, and
conduct participant recruitment, ethical and compliant acquisition, linkage, usage, analysis and sharing of PHI-
containing multi-dimensional data and annotated biospecimens. Ultimately, this collaborative infrastructure will
facilitate broad access to SHOW data and biospecimens, enable early detection and treatment of emerging
health issues, improve understanding of the role of environmental and lifestyle factors, harmful chemical
exposures, and genetics on human health, and unlock new pathways for evidence-based prevention of
environmentally caused diseases."
10823627,"The current study proposal is a mechanistic ancillary grant application that will leverage the infrastructure of an
actively enrolling, NIH-funded, multi-site R01 research project (1 R01 AR078396-01A1). This proposal is
time-sensitive because the parent R01 is currently recruiting and enrolling patients at UNC-Chapel Hill and
Virginia Tech and if delayed beyond the proposed start date, the resulting sample size loss will negatively
impact the power of our expanded and more comprehensive prognostic models. The parent R01 is actively
recruiting patients with first-time (primary) ACL reconstructions (ACLR) to participate in a single visit to collect
clinical data, patient reported outcomes, muscle strength and kinetic loading data using in-shoe wearable
sensors. This session is scheduled at the time when patients are released from medical care by their
physician to return to unrestricted physical activity. After the data collection session, patients are followed for
18 months via monthly electronic surveys to determine engagement in physical activity, perceived function,
and occurrence of a second ACL injury. The parent R01 grant submission did originally not include motion
capture due to high cost, time-burden to research participants and lack of access of the equipment required to
collect kinematic data in a clinical setting. Since the parent R01 was awarded, an opensource markerless
motion capture technology became available, presenting a unique opportunity to capture lower body
kinematics using clinically accessible methods. The current ancillary study proposal will benefit the parent
R01 tremendously through the addition of kinematic data in a clinical setting, which was not possible when
the parent grant was submitted, and at a much lower cost and shorter time-line than submitting a separate
grant application. In this ancillary proposal, we will utilize markerless videography while participants enrolled
in the parent R01 perform jump-landing and hopping procedures. We will record and calculate joint kinematics
from the ankle, knee, and hip in the sagittal and frontal planes, using two iPads in positioned within the testing
area and processed using an NIH-supported open-source data capture technology (OpenCap.ai). The resulting
movement data will be analyzed using advanced multi-joint approaches to derive kinematic features that will
enable our research team to develop predictive models for second ACL injuries using lower body kinematics
and joint coordination. The kinematic data will be combined with the existing kinetic-loading data collected from
wearable in-shoe sensors (Parent R01) to develop a comprehensive mechanistic prognostic model for second
ACL injury risk after primary ACLR. This highly innovative proposal will advance the understanding of
mechanisms of risk for second ACL injuries through inclusion of multi-joint movement coordination during
unilateral and bilateral landing tasks. The ability to detect subtle movement coordination features in a natural
and unrestricted environment will empower clinicians and scientists to track progress, identify risk and optimize
outcomes over the course of rehabilitation using clinically accessible and open-source technologies."
10824148,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite advances in pharmaceutical and surgical approaches to the treatment of Parkinson’s disease (PD), an
effective disease modifying treatment remains elusive. A growing body of evidence supports the notion that
high intensity aerobic exercise, when delivered in a highly supervised, well-controlled laboratory setting,
improves PD symptomology. Despite community exercise being recommended by the American Physical
Therapy Association, high intensity aerobic exercise performed in a community-setting is not supported by third
party payors and therefore not delivered by physical therapists. The aim of this project is to address two
fundamental gaps related to the widespread utilization of exercise to modify PD: 1) are community-based
exercise programs effective in altering disease progression? and 2) what is the role of genetics in modulating
the disease altering effects of high intensity aerobic exercise? Our underlying hypothesis is that high-intensity
community-based exercise is effective in slowing disease progression in PD and those positive effects are
more likely to occur in individuals with a lower genetic\biological burden. The proposed multi-site, Genetics and
Aerobic Exercise to Slow (GEARS) PD trial will determine the interplay between genetics and exercise in
altering PD progression. A total of 250 individuals with PD will be enrolled in Pedaling for Parkinson’s (PFP)
programs across six locations in NE Ohio and Salt Lake City. The PFP exercise protocol is rooted in our
established and effective laboratory-based exercise protocol for PD (e.g. exercise at 60-80% of heart rate
reserve and strive to pedal at 75 RPMs). The PFP community group will exercise 3 times per week for 12
months. A novel and efficient aspect of the GEARS Trial is the leveraging of PD control data (n=125) from Dr.
Alberts’ CYCLE-II RCT (2R01NS073717; enrollment completed March 2022). Identical clinical and
biomechanical data characterizing motor and non-motor function will be gathered from the PFP group to match
historical control outcomes. Genetic burden for PD will be determined for all 375 PD patients by determining
the PD polygenic risk score. Aims 1-3 will determine the disease altering potential of community-based
exercise using clinical and biomechanical outcomes reflective of motor and non-motor performance. A
prognostic model will be developed in Aim 4 to predict what factors are important in modulating the beneficial
effects of exercise on slowing disease progression. The model will facilitate understanding of the interplay of
genetics, aerobic exercise, and disease progression and serve as a non-incremental step in the development
of patient-specific exercise recommendations in which potential outcomes can be estimated. Demonstrating
the effectiveness of a community-based exercise program, that can be scaled for minimal cost, will bring an
effective intervention to PD patients that is not impacted by the healthcare reimbursement policy and politics."
10809599,"Project Summary/Abstract
This study's principal hypothesis is that delivering a circadian-effective, tailored lighting intervention (TLI)
will reveal a strong association between dose (amount and duration) and improvement in outcome measures
of sleep, behavior, and mood among people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD),
with greater responses being associated with greater doses. It is also hypothesized that a longer morning TLI
exposure (e.g., 4 h) will be more effective for improving theses outcomes, and that an all-day TLI exposure will
result in later bedtimes and greater sleep onset latency. It is further hypothesized that long-term exposure to
the TLI will promote better sleep, improved cognition, and reduced depression and agitation compared to
control lighting intervention. Preliminary results from an ongoing study of a TLI delivering a fixed amount of
circadian stimulus (CS) have demonstrated significant improvements in sleep and behavior in AD/ADRD
patients, over both the short (4 weeks) and the long (4 months) term. Elucidating the relationship between the
TLI's dose and the study's outcomes will further contribute to the scientific understanding of AD/ADRD
while providing a translational component for the development of new lighting products designed to promote
sleep and reduce behavioral disturbances in AD/ADRD patients.
The study's aims are 3-fold and involve AD/ADRD patients living in controlled environments (memory care,
nursing homes, long-term care), examining the TLI's effects on measures of sleep, behavior, and mood. First, a
randomized, within-subjects, placebo-controlled study involving 135 participants will investigate the effects of
3 TLI doses, 1 h/day, for 3 consecutive 4-week periods (with 2 intervening 4-week washouts). A second
randomized, mixed design, placebo-controlled study involving 135 participants will investigate the effects of a
fixed-CS TLI (same as in the ongoing study) of 3 durations (2 h in the morning, 4 h in the morning, and all day)
for 2 consecutive 4-week periods (with 1 intervening 4-week washout). A non-active lighting intervention will
be used as placebo control for each of the 3 active TLI conditions. A third single-arm, placebo-controlled study
involving 200 participants will investigate the impact of the optimal CS dose (amount and duration
determined from the first two aims) for a period of 6 months. Participants will be randomly selected to receive
either the active or the placebo intervention. The CS dose will be measured in the field for all 3 study aims.
The strengths of this project are considerable, as very few instruments are otherwise available to measure
personal circadian light exposures and activity patterns. The study population would benefit immensely and
immediately from a tailored, non-pharmacological treatment to improve sleep efficiency and consolidation.
Effective treatment can significantly reduce the burden on society and, more directly, on caregivers. The expert
project team is unique, including a practicing physician/clinician who has access to the population and a team

This proposal explores the hypothesis that sphingolipids such as ceramides serve as common, cell-autonomous
signals that impair beta cell function and contribute to the development of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The idea
is predicated upon data presented herein showing that the administration of a pharmacological inhibitor of
ceramide biosynthesis to rodents preserves the beta cell and prevents the development of both forms of the
disease (i.e. in Zucker Diabetic Fatty rats as well as Non-Obese Diabetic mice). The theory is further supported
by studies in human and mouse islets implicating ceramides as intermediates linking saturated fatty acids and
inflammatory cytokines to the impairment of insulin secretion, mitochondrial function, and beta cell survival. We
will evaluate this hypothesized role for ceramides and its metabolites in the pancreatic islet through the following
aims:
· First, we will study new mouse models allowing for the conditional, beta cell-specific modulation of genes
 involved in ceramide synthesis or degradation, allowing us to determine whether the lipids are either (a)
 necessary or (b) sufficient for beta cell failure and the onset of frank hyperglycemia.
· Second, we will test the efficacy of a new class of ceramide synthesis inhibitors targeting dihydroceramide
 desaturase-1 as therapeutics that improve insulin secretion and prevent type 1 or type 2 diabetes in
rodents.
· Third, we will determine the mechanisms through which ceramides impair the function of mouse and
 human islets. We will test a hypothesized role for ceramides as drivers of metabolic reprogramming using
 state-of-the-art metabolic tracing, mitochondrial phenotyping, and cell function assays.
Findings obtained from these studies could uncover new nutrient-sensing and/or inflammatory mechanisms that
modulate islet function, survival and growth. Moreover, the translational component of this work could lead to
the development of new therapeutic alternatives for preventing or treating diabetes."

Tau pathology in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is linked to neuronal activity in multiple ways, including an effect of
activity to increase tau phosphorylation [1], tau spread between neurons, and tau shedding into the CSF [2], and
activity inhibition reduces tau pathology [3]. NPTX2 (Neuronal Pentraxins 2) is an immediate early gene (IEG)
that acts specifically at excitatory synapses on parvalbumin interneurons (PV) to regulate circuit inhibition and is
prominently down-regulated in the brain of individuals with AD [4]. During its normal function, a portion of synaptic
NPTX2 is shed into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) where levels in human subjects inversely correlate with
cognitive performance and hippocampal volume in MCI and AD [4-6]. One consistent observation in these
studies is that a ratio of CSF NPTX2 and tau or ptau prominently increases diagnostic performance [4-6]. This
suggests an important relationship between CSF NPTX2 and tau/ptau in AD. NPTX2 is generated by pyramidal
neurons (Py) throughout the forebrain and is trafficked along axons to presynaptic sites where it is exocytosed
in response to Py activity and functions specifically at excitatory synapses on PV to strengthen the excitatory
drive of PVs, thereby enhancing inhibition within the circuit [7, 8]. Consistent with these synaptic effects, NPTX2
loss of function results in increased Py activity and reduced gamma power, and these effects are amplified by
Aß amyloidosis [4]. These observations focus attention on potential interactions between NPTX2 loss of function
and tau pathophysiology. To examine the interaction of tau with NPTX2, we will use a newly established rat AD
model (TgF344-AD) that expresses human FAD mutations including APP (APPswe) and presenilin 1 (PSΔE9)
and mimics human disease by developing tau pathology without requiring mutation of tau [9]. Aim 1 will develop
novel tools to image tau accumulation in vivo using 2-photon microscopy. Fluorescent tau indicators, termed
Tau1 and Tau 2, will be evaluated for detection of tau accumulations in TgF344-AD rats following either i.v. or
local injection of the reporters into the brain using a novel perforated cranial window. In vivo 2-photon images of
tau will be correlated with histopathologically imaged tau. Aim 2 will examine the impact of conditional deletion
of NPTX2 in TgF344-AD rat neocortex on tau accumulation and cellular localization and correlate these
parameters with the activity of Py and PV neurons using cutting-edge multi-color longitudinal 2 photon imaging.
The proposed research will develop methods to image pathologic tau accumulation in vivo and test the
association of pathological forms of tau with NPTX2 loss of function and resulting changes in brain activity."
10807789,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by aggregation of Tau protein into paired
helical filaments causing neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in the brain. The goal of this study is to design, develop
and evaluate the effectiveness of novel radioiodinated tracers for binding to Tau protein in postmortem human
brains of AD and non-AD Taupathies and serve as in vivo imaging agents. These novel radioligands, such as
IPPI, will be suitable for in vitro studies ([125I]IPPI), for extended positron emission tomography (PET) studies
([124I]IPPI) and for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies ([123I]IPPI). The radioligands
will complement and support studies of several PET NFT imaging agents, such as [18F]MK-6240, currently being
carried out in AD related disorders (ADRD). Phosphorylated Tau (pTau) is a reliable marker for NFT
accumulation in AD beginning in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, spreading to the temporal cortex and
subsequently to the neocortex. Preliminary studies using [125I]IPPI in human AD frontal cortex, anterior cingulate
and hippocampus show excellent binding of [125I]IPPI to Tau consistent with total Tau (tTau)
immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. However, variations in the degree of [125I]IPPI binding and sensitivity to
distinguish Braak stages lower than IV needs to be understood. Several pTau species are known to be present
in AD. Novel radiotracers that exhibit high binding affinity and selectivity for Tau (Ki<10 nM Tau; Ki>1 M for A)
and optimal lipophilicity will be evaluated in AD, cognitively normal, progressive supranuclear palsy, Pick’s
disease, corticobasal degeneration and Down’s syndrome subjects. Brain regions will be studied using
radioiodinated tracers including [125/124/123I]IPPI and IHC. Methods of image analysis for detailed IHC and
autoradiography will be used to correlate binding. Because of the interplay between A plaques and NFT,
autoradiographic images of A plaques (using [18F]flotaza and [125I]IBETA) will also be acquired. Correlation of
A plaques and NFT autoradiography will be carried out in brain regions of the same subjects. The binding of
radioiodinated tracers, [125/124/123I]IPPI will also be compared with [18F]MK-6240 and [18F]AV-1451. This will
further demonstrate the potential translational utility of the radioiodinated ligands for human AD imaging studies.
In vivo metabolic stability, brain penetration and clearance of the [124I] and [123I]radiotracers will be evaluated in
rats, wild type and Tau transgenic mice using in vivo PET and SPECT, respectively. Based on the in vitro and in
vivo parameters of Tau imaging, the optimal derivative will be chosen for whole-body radiation dosimetry and
acute toxicity studies. An exploratory IND application will be filed with FDA for the selected imaging agent. Thus,
the overall impact of this application will be the availability of novel radioiodinated Tau imaging agent for NFT
imaging using SPECT and PET. Our promising preliminary work with [125I]IPPI and [125I]INFT is indicative of the
likelihood of success for imaging human NFT in ADRD using these novel radioiodinated Tau imaging agents."

I have two overall career goals, which directly align with the aims of this proposal: 1) to generate high quality patient-
oriented research at the nexus of geriatric oncology and supportive care interventions, generating the critically
needed evidence to inform and improve the care of older adults with cancer through the use of new infrastructure
underlying the City of Hope’s Center for Cancer and Aging and the national Cancer and Aging Research Group
(CARG), both of which I lead; and 2) to mentor the next generation of geriatric oncology and supportive care scholars
and future leaders in patient-oriented research based on newly-created infrastructure to ensure a healthy cadre of
well-trained researchers in aging and cancer poised to sustain the field. This is important because one in three
Americans over the age of 60 will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime. From 2010 to 2030, cancer incidence is
expected to rise 67% for individuals age ≥ 65, making cancer a disease of aging. Dr. Arti Hurria, my close colleague
from whom I inherited this award, dedicated her career to developing and validating the CARG Geriatric Assessment
(GA) and conducting evidence-based research showing the positive patient-centered outcomes of GA-guided care. I
am carrying out her vision cut short with her death. Although GA is now considered the standard of care, only 20% of
older patients with cancer receive a GA in the community setting. The goal of this K24 Renewal for the Midcareer
Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research is to: 1) unite the fields of geriatrics, oncology, and supportive
care by building and sustaining the infrastructure to provide equitable patient-centered care for an aging oncology
population, and 2) mentor the next generation of geriatric oncology and supportive care investigators and future
leaders using this infrastructure. There are three components proposed in this application. The first is a
comprehensive mentoring program to foster the career development of trainees from diverse backgrounds by
teaching patient-oriented research skills for geriatric oncology and supportive care. This includes the development of
an individualized career development plan that will enable each mentee to learn the skills of patient-oriented
research; 1:1 mentor-mentee meetings; and seminars and coursework to foster mentees’ career development. The
second component is to leverage the recently received infrastructure grants (NIA R33 grant, Rising Tide Foundation
GOTO Grant, PI: W. Dale) to support the conduct of patient-oriented research focused on improving the care of older
adults with cancer. The third component is my own career development plan, which will include expanding recent
interventional and implementation work’s impact by leveraging newly developed infrastructure, and expanding my
skill set in national aging scholarship through 1:1 mentoring. The research, mentorship, and training proposed in
this application address key priorities identified by the National Institute of Aging, National Cancer Institute,
Institute of Medicine, and American Society of Clinical Oncology to improve the care of older adults with
cancer."
10809782,"Effect of Hearing Aid Insurance Coverage Requirements for Adults on Utilization
Abstract
Hearing loss affects 23% of those aged 12 and older in the U.S. More than 2/3 of U.S. adults over the age of
70 have significant hearing loss. The most efficacious management option for most individuals with hearing
loss is the use of hearing aids (i.e., a small removable electronic device that is worn in or behind the ear to
amplify sound), which can improve communication and quality of life. Hearing aids are generally not covered
by insurance and about 86% of hearing loss cases go untreated. However, Medicaid provides hearing aid
benefits in 28 states and 8 states require private insurance benefits for at least some adults. These coverage
requirements may improve hearing aid uptake by reducing costs as a barrier. The long-term goal of our
research agenda is to understand the effects of improving hearing on health. Specifically, the objective of our
current application is to use quasi-experimental (e.g., difference-in-differences) evaluation methods to estimate
the effect of coverage requirements in Medicaid and private insurance plans on hearing aid use. We will use
high quality, reproducible Anthem private insurance claims data, National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data,
Medicaid claims-linked NHIS data, and Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) data to study: (i) the
effect of state private insurance coverage requirements for hearing aids on beneficiary hearing aid purchasing
and out-of-pocket payments in fully-insured health insurance plans; (ii) the effect of Medicaid and private
insurance coverage requirements on use of hearing aids in the NHIS, and Medicaid coverage requirements in
the Medicaid-linked NHIS and MCBS (for dual-eligibles); and (iii) the effect of private and Medicaid
requirements by demographic group. Our project is significant by focusing on high rates of untreated hearing
loss; by estimating the effects of state implementation of private and public insurance coverage requirements
on hearing aid adoption among U.S. adults (which provides evidence for the effects of pending national
legislation); and by providing evidence on whether hearing aid coverage requirements improve well-
documented disparities in hearing aid use for males, racial/ethnic minorities, and lower-educated individuals.
Our project is innovative by being the first to use quasi-experimental difference-in-differences methods (which
can provide causal evidence) for hearing health care research, including newer methods accounting for
heterogeneous treatment effects; leveraging powerful sources of currently under-used data to study hearing
health care access and utilization; constructing detailed coverage requirement data through original policy
research that we will make available publicly. The research team includes experts in clinical audiology, health
economics, advanced statistical modeling, insurance claims data, and health policy. The proposed project will
have a positive impact because addressing system barriers to affordable and accessible hearing health care
has the potential to reduce disparities and increase use."

Social anxiety disorder (or social phobia) is the most common form of anxiety disorder in the United States.
Affected individuals avoid social contexts, which disrupts social relationships and impairs performance at
school or work. New therapeutic approaches are needed because ~40% of affected individuals who seek
existing treatments do not respond. Oxytocin is a well-known modulator of social behaviors, and has been put
forth as a possible therapeutic. In some studies using human participants, intranasal oxytocin enhances social
approach related behaviors. However, other studies (especially in women) report that intranasal oxytocin
increases social anxiety. How can the same neuropeptide exert such different effects on behavior? Our central
hypothesis is that oxytocin acts in the mesolimbic dopamine system to promote social approach, whereas
oxytocin acts in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) to enhance social anxiety. This hypothesis is
conceptually innovative because it can reconcile apparently contradictory findings in both human and animal
studies of oxytocin function. The proposed studies will test this hypothesis in both males and females because
social anxiety disorder is more prevalent in women than men. Our studies will use the California mouse social
defeat model, which induces a stronger social anxiety phenotype in females versus males.
First, we will use antisense morpholinos to selectively inhibit oxytocin synthesis in neurons within the BNST or
hypothalamus (which project to the nucleus accumbens, NAc) to determine how these cells modulate social
anxiety and social approach. Next, we will use viral vectors to visualize oxytocin producing cells in the BNST
and hypothalamus. We will isolate oxytocin neurons for single-cell RNAseq analyses, and we will also conduct
electrophysiological analyses. We will determine the extent to which social stress induces molecular and
physiological responses that increase excitability. Finally, we will study the behavioral effects of oxytocin
receptor (OTR) in the NAc and BNST using biased agonists that selectively induce OTR coupling of either Gq
or Gi pathways. Our research team is ideally suited to execute these studies. Dr. Trainor's lab developed the
California mouse social defeat model and collected most of the preliminary data. Dr. Robison is a behavioral
neuroscientist with strong molecular and electrophysiology skills. Dr. Settles is an expert in bioinformatics and
performed analyses of single-cell RNAseq data. Dr. Chini is a leading authority on OTR G-protein coupling and
provides expertise for pharmacology studies. Dr. Grinevich developed viral tools for targeting oxytocin neurons
and provides viruses and advice. Our analyses of how stress alters the physiological and molecular
phenotypes of distinct populations of oxytocin neurons from males and females are unprecedented, and could
lead to novel insights into how to selectively target these cells."

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infects the lungs causing 1.6 million deaths a year. The only vaccine
approved for tuberculosis has limited efficacy. Additionally, antibiotic treatment requires six months, but can
require two or more years for multi-drug resistant strains that are becoming more prevalent. Therefore,
development of a host-directed therapeutic strategy that directly targets the Mtb reservoir would dramatically
impact human health. I propose to identify novel innate immune factors that protect against Mtb infection in
vivo, which could be the basis of such a therapeutic approach. Specific Aims: During Mtb infection,
inflammatory cytokines like IL-1 stimulate non-infected cells to produce factors that enhance anti-bacterial
activity of Mtb-bearing cells. While IL-1 is critical for protection against Mtb, its mechanism of action is
unknown. Aim 1) We have identified IL-1 sensing cells in Mtb-infected lungs and IL-1-induced genes
expressed by these cells. I will test whether natural killer T 17 cells, one of the IL-1 sensing populations,
provides protection against Mtb. Additionally, I will determine which IL-1-induced genes act directly on Mtb
infected macrophages in vivo to confer the protective effect of IL-1. Aim 2) Neutrophils are detrimental in Mtb-
susceptible mouse strains and neutrophilia positively correlates with bacterial burden and mortality in humans.
However, it is unclear how neutrophils interfere with the host response to Mtb. We have previously shown that
IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) is an immunosuppressive molecule that limits Mtb control in a susceptible
mouse strain. As IL-1Ra is highly expressed by neutrophils, I will determine whether neutrophils inhibit the
protective response against Mtb through their production of IL-1Ra and whether this immunosuppressive
function is conserved across multiple Mtb susceptible strains. Additionally, I will determine whether neutrophils
exploit other immunosuppressive pathways, like IL-18 signaling inhibition and PD-1, to hinder the productive
immune response to Mtb. Study Design: I will define how communication between non-infected and infected
cells leads to control of tuberculosis infection by generating mixed bone marrow chimeras. These experiments
will test the in vivo relevance of IL-1-driven gene expression for candidates identified in our single cell RNA-
sequencing dataset of Mtb-infected lungs. Additionally, I will leverage our single cell RNA-sequencing dataset
to determine how neutrophils inhibit control of the infection in Mtb-sensitive mouse strains. Potential Impact:
The identification of protective and inhibitory regulators of Mtb control can serve as the basis for host-directed
therapies to treat Mtb infection, which will be a major advance for the field."
10809801,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A growing body of evidence implicates oxidative stress in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Nevertheless, it
is currently unknow if it is a cause, a by-product or a consequence of disease. The effects of oxidative stress on
cellular damage caused by reactive oxygen species is usually attributed to modifying proteins and DNA.
However, RNA oxidation occurs ten times more often than DNA oxidation. Importantly, high levels of oxidized
RNA are detected in relevant neuronal tissues of patients with ALS while, mouse models of ALS show increased
RNA oxidation in motor neurons of the spinal cord at an early pre-symptomatic stage. What remains lacking,
however, is an understanding of the functional relationship between RNA oxidation and ALS onset and
progression. Thus, there is a critical need to identify which motor neuron transcripts are oxidized in early, pre-
symptomatic stages of ALS and how this dysregulation contributes to neuronal death and other molecular
hallmarks of ALS. I believe that there are many, yet to be discovered, RNA Binding Proteins (RBPs) that are
crucial for controlling the fate of oxidized RNAs. I hypothesize that RNA oxidation drives motor neuron
degeneration in ALS by dysregulating proper RNA processing by RBPs. I will test this hypothesis by (1)
elucidating, in iPSC-derived motor neurons, the RNA targets and the consequences of depletion of known RBPs
that interact with oxidized RNAs and identify novel ones; (2) identifying and comparing oxidized RNAs in iPSC-
derived motor neuron models; and (3) investigating, at a single cell resolution, the effects of RNA oxidation on
transcription, translation and RBP-RNA interactions in iPSC-derived spinal organoid ALS models. If successful,
this project will generate the foundational methods and insights to enable early, pre-symptomatic-stage
diagnostic approaches and interventions to reduce RNA oxidation levels in high-risk individuals.
My background in DNA damage and repair and single cell transcriptomics together with the Yeo lab’s expertise
on RNA processing and neurodegeneration make me an ideal candidate to accomplish the research proposed
above. These three aims will serve as a basis for my independent academic position generating the foundational
methods and insights to study the effects of RNA damage. The Yeo lab at UCSD is an ideal environment to
perform this research and complete my training towards pursuit of an independent academic faculty position, as
it has consistently been a leader in developing both experimental and computational methods to characterize
RNA processing and RBP regulation. Additionally, the location of the Yeo lab proximal to outstanding
researchers at UCSD, the Salk Institute, and other research institutes and biotechnology companies in La Jolla
will provide ample opportunities for mentored training in performing research and developing an independent
research program."
10809658,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite significant research advances in the past two decades, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains the sixth
leading cause of death that cannot be prevented, cured or even slowed. Attention has shifted towards under-
standing early synaptic events in AD and related dementia (ADRD), resulting in memory deficits. However, the
mechanism recruited and leading to synapse dysfunction associated memory deficits remains elusive thus im-
peding successful therapeutic intervention. Bridging this critical gap in our current knowledge is the goal of this
proposal. We present compelling preliminary results that support our hypothesis that inducible phospholipase D
(PLD1) overexpression and the resulting aberrant signaling contributes to the progressive detrimental impact on
synapses and subsequent cognitive deficits. We will test our central hypothesis by pursuing the following specific
aims: (I) testing how elevated synaptic PLD1 levels/signaling contributes to synaptic dysfunction and memory
deficits in ADRD; (II) evaluating the functional contribution of elevated PLD1 in preclinical mouse models and
studying partners contributing to ADRD-like synaptic dysfunction and memory deficits. The present project is
highly significant because the proposed studies will establish elevated PLD1 and the associated signaling part-
ners as key players in promoting vulnerability causing progressive synaptic dysfunction and underlying cognitive
deficits. The successful completion of the aims will provide insight into the involved molecular mechanisms and
therapeutic possibilities using well-tolerated small molecule PLD1 inhibitor in preventing memory deficits asso-
ciated with ADRD progression. The proposed project will improve our scientific understanding of how synaptic
dysfunction is mediated by elevated PLD1 and interacting signaling partners in contributing to synaptic vulnera-
bility."
10807383,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect 5.5 million people in the US and account for $305 billion in
health care spending annually. Nearly half of all Medicare decedents have an ADRD diagnosis prior to death. Nursing
homes play an important role in end-of-life (EOL) care for individuals with ADRD. Among the 1.4 million nursing home
residents in the US, 68% have some degree of ADRD, with the prevalence expected to increase. More than two-thirds of all
ADRD-related deaths occur in nursing homes. Nursing home ownership has been associated with the quality of EOL care
for residents with ADRD. Among US nursing homes, 12% have investment from real estate investment trusts (REITs). It
is not known whether REIT investments in nursing homes are associated with the quality of EOL care. The prevalence and
increasing rates of these corporate investments have raised concerns among policymakers and oversight agencies including
the Government Accountability Office, MedPAC, the House Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Finance Committee,
and The White House. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have proposed a new rule that would require public
reporting of REIT investments in nursing homes. REITs are for-profit public or private corporations that invest in income-
producing properties. They are “pass-through entities” which qualify for tax exemptions if they satisfy requirements related
to sources of income and assets, including disbursing 90% of their taxable income to shareholders as dividends. These
corporations purchase a nursing home's property and lease it back to the nursing home operator. Under this arrangement,
the operator pays all of the expenses of the property, including real estate taxes, building insurance, and maintenance. These
expenses are in addition to the cost of rent and utilities that are paid to the REIT by the operator. REITs are not directly
involved in nursing home operations, though they may provide guidance to help the operator achieve profitability goals.
Selling a nursing home's property to a REIT provides the operator with an infusion of capital that can conceivably be used
for facility improvements and/or to provide more resources for resident care. However, annual rent escalations that are
typically included in the leases may make rent unaffordable for nursing home operators over time and potentially lead to
reductions in staffing, supplies, or equipment that negatively impact the quality of EOL care. Preliminary analyses indicate
that registered nurse staffing levels in nursing homes are often reduced following REIT investment. For this project, a
nationally representative database of nursing home residents with ADRD will be constructed from Medicare claims and
Minimum Data Set assessments and merged with a novel database of REIT investments in nursing homes for the period
2012-2022. This will be the first study of the relationships between REIT investments in nursing homes and the quality and
cost of care at the EOL for residents with ADRD. The project addresses priority areas of the National Institute of Aging by
identifying economic and organizational factors associated with the use and quality of health care services for individuals
with ADRD. The results will provide important insights sought by policymakers that will also benefit payers and nursing
home residents with ADRD and their families."
10810686,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), an aggressive leukemia characterized by the excessive proliferation of abnormal
myeloid progenitor cells in the bone marrow (BM), and carries a 5-year survival rate less than 25%.
Overexpression of the oncogene ecotropic viral integration site 1 (EVI1) in AML is associated with shorter survival
durations and higher relapse rates. AML-associated relapse is multifactorial, and previous studies have shown
that the activation of cell cycle quiescence protects AML subclones during chemotherapy, resulting in their
survival. Given the severity of EVI1-overexpressing AML, the lack of an in-depth understanding of the role of
EVI1 in AML patients’ shorter survival durations and higher relapse rates, and the inadequacy of current
therapeutic strategies, we aim to gain a better understanding of EVI1-associated chemoresistance with the long-
term goal of developing novel therapies for this sever form of AML. Our preliminary studies using an EVI1-
overexpressing AML mouse model and patient samples indicate that EVI1 overexpression activates quiescence
pathways. Our ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq data revealed that the mechanism of EVI1-induced quiescence involves
two pathways: 1) the upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C (CDKN1C/P57kip2), a critical activator
of hematopoietic stem cell quiescence, whose expression has been linked with AML relapse; and 2) the
activation of purine-rich box binding protein 1 (PU.1), a master regulator of myelopoiesis, which is sufficient to
trigger cell cycle quiescence in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Thus, we hypothesize that EVI1 overexpression
protects AML cells from chemotherapy by activating quiescence through CDKN1C and PU.1 pathways.
To test our hypothesis, we will elucidate the mechanism of EVI1-induced CDKN1C expression and its role in
quiescence (Aim 1), and investigate the role of PU.1 activation in EVI1-associated quiescence (Aim 2) in EVI1-
overexpressing AML. This will be accomplished by integrating data from RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and
other techniques to analyze EVI1-overexpressing leukemia cells from our in vitro and in vivo models and from
primary human AML samples. To translate the proposed mechanistic insights into clinical settings and
therapeutic strategies, we will test new treatment regiments in preclinical studies using EVI1-overexpressing
AML patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models (Aim 3). In summary, the proposed work will focus on investigating
EVI1-induced quiescence mechanisms, and its findings will not only help explain the shorter survival durations
and higher relapse rates associated with EVI1-overexpressing leukemia but also unveil new therapeutic
strategies that reactivate the cell cycle and improve the survival of patients with EVI1-overexpressing AML."

pregnancy or the postpartum period. Pregnant and postpartum women would benefit from easily accessible,
non-pharmacologic, and inexpensive self-management approaches, such as via the internet, to prevent
development of symptoms and/or intervene with current symptoms. At present, no systematic internet-based
self-management approaches designed to prevent or treat perinatal depressive symptoms exist in the U.S. Our
proposed study will address this gap by evaluating an internet-based self-management program to prevent and
intervene with perinatal depressive symptoms— “Mamma Mia”— in a large scale randomized controlled study.
“Mamma Mia” is a self-guided program that women will begin during the “teachable moment” of pregnancy,
when intrinsic motivation for self-management is high, and will complete by six months postpartum. The
program contains a novel combination of components designed to enable women to enhance self-efficacy,
emotional self-regulation, and perceived social support. With our Norwegian colleagues, we recently
established the feasibility and efficacy of “Mamma Mia” for perinatal depressive symptoms in 1342 women in
Norway and we piloted a demonstration version in the U.S. The proposed study builds upon our findings by
adapting the intervention for a diverse U.S. audience; by using national and hub-based (local) strategies for
recruiting women of diverse racial/ethnic and socioeconomic status; and, by adding a small amount of guided
support (“Mamma Mia Plus”). The overall goal of this three-arm longitudinal randomized controlled trial is to
evaluate the effects and mechanisms of this internet-based self-management approach in diverse women in
the U.S. (n=1950). Enrolled pregnant women will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) “Mamma
Mia” in which they engage in 44 modules throughout their pregnancy and the first six months postpartum; (2)
“Mamma Mia Plus” in which they engage in the “Mamma Mia” modules plus receive brief guided support from
a registered nurse; or (3) usual prenatal/postpartum care. The first specific aim is to evaluate effects by group
on the primary outcome of interest, depressive symptom severity, over time. The second aim is to evaluate
effects by group on subjective well-being, anxiety, and stress. Using a conceptual framework based upon
Individual and Family Self-Management Theory, the tertiary aim is to evaluate possible mediators (self-efficacy,
emotion self-regulation, perceived support) and possible moderators (e.g., race/ethnicity, type of healthcare
clinician) of this self-management approach, which may differ from those in the Norwegian RCT. We seek to
shift the clinical paradigm regarding prevention of perinatal depressive symptoms by using an internet-based
self-management approach that allows for wide-ranging accessibility and large reach to individuals across all
geographical regions of the U.S. If proven efficacious, “Mamma Mia” may be a low-cost, sustainable, and
translatable option for prevention of and intervention in perinatal depressive symptoms."

In the first two weeks of development, the human embryo breaks symmetry twice, transforming itself from a
uniform ball of cells into a highly-patterned, spatially organized set of tissues. Although decades of elegant
genetics and biochemistry in non-human model organisms have uncovered many of the essential signaling
proteins and pathways for embryonic patterning at this early stage, a lack of tools for directly manipulating the
signaling in time and space, as well as limitations to working with human embryos, have limited our ability to
understand how these early patterning events arise in humans. Thus, my laboratory seeks to develop
engineering strategies to (1) understand what patterns of signaling activity encode extracellular information,
and (2) determine how these patterns are decoded at the tissue level to drive high fidelity collective cell fate
decisions in human embryonic stem cells.
 This proposal brings together many recent advances in stem cell and molecular engineering to decode
how spatiotemporal signaling and embryo size instruct tissue fate patterning. We leverage advances in 2D
micropatterning, 3D bioprinting, cellular optogenetic control over developmental signaling pathways, and
CRISPR-based reporters of cell signaling pathways. Together, these technologies give us unprecedented
control over and visualization of microengineered models of human gastrulation, thereby enabling us to
investigate the principles of environmental information transmission and potential mechanisms of pregnancy
loss and developmental anomalies that arise with a surprisingly high frequency (10-20% by some estimates) in
the early human embryo. In addition, our platform does not face the same ethical barriers that have limited
human embryo research, allowing us to ascertain how physical and information-bearing parameters of the
embryo lead to stereotyped patterning of the germ layers during human gastrulation. In this proposal, we focus
on the role of canonical developmental signaling pathways by dissecting the effects of spatiotemporal signaling
and variance of the Wnt pathway on germ layer fate positioning in 2D (Aim 1); examining the role of Erk
signaling on positioning, dynamics, and coordination of cells during the development of the
mesoderm/trophectoderm boundary (Aim 2); and examining the effect of cell number and tissue size in 3D
gastrulating models of the human epiblast and amniotic sac (Aim 3)."
10810699,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) corneal infections are leading infectious causes of blindness world-wide.
It is well established that the blinding form of HSV-1 infection called herpes stromal keratitis (HSK) is caused
by the immune response to the virus rather than by a direct effect of the virus on corneal cells. The disease
tends to recur in people because the virus invades and establishes a quiescent (latent) infection in sensory
nerves during initial (primary) infection. HSV-1 periodically reactivates from the latent state, travels back down
the nerves to the cornea, and triggers recurrent bouts of HSK. A hallmark of HSK is loss of corneal sensitivity
that has been associated with loss of corneal sensory nerve endings. However, the role of the neuroimmune
axis in pathology is incompletely understood. Our preliminary studies in mice demonstrated that a host factor,
Sterile alpha and TIR motif containing 1 (SARM1), acts to prevent HSK as SARM1 deficient mice develop
more severe HSK compared to WT controls. While SARM1 is conventionally linked to neuronal cells, it also
can function in various immune cell populations. Therefore, we plan to assess the functional consequences of
SARM1 during HSK in nerve and immune cells. Specifically, our first aim will investigate how SARM1
deficiency may affect viral control and the generation of the anti-viral immune response over time. Our second
aim will focus on defining immune cell intrinsic mechanisms of SARM1 by comparing immune cell functionality,
migration, and metabolism of SARM1 deficient immune cells to WT immune cells in vivo and in vitro. Finally,
our third aim will investigate how SARM1 deficiency affects sensory and sympathetic nerve growth during
steady state and in the context of neurotrophic viral infection. We posit a role that SARM1 limits the activation
of inflammatory monocytes while also limiting the outgrowth of sympathetic nerves, which we have found to
contribute to pathogenesis in ocular HSV-1 infection. Overall, we anticipate that our studies will identify SARM1
as a host factor that plays an integral role in preventing HSK."
10808782,"As cannabis legalization increases, there have been concurrent increases in use. A common reason for use is
the mitigation of anxiety and stress, which has been exacerbated with the COVID-19 pandemic. However,
cannabis use for coping purposes is associated with greater quantity and frequency (Q/F) of cannabis use,
increased risk for cannabis-related problems, and greater likelihood for cannabis dependence. In turn, greater
Q/F of cannabis use and dependence can lead to safety risks, mental/physical health issues, and other
problems like greater Q/F of alcohol use. Thus, developing a greater understanding of cannabis use for coping
purposes is a critical research endeavor. There are several important avenues of research that can inform our
understanding of this use pattern. The first is examining if quantity of cannabis is actually increased when used
for coping purposes, which has not yet been experimentally tested, as well as exploring factors that may
moderate this effect (e.g., social anxiety and inhibitory control). A second avenue is investigating whether
cannabis use actually mitigates stress. A third avenue is exploring the biological role of the endocannabinoid
system as a mechanism by which cannabis use may relate to acute stress reduction as well as the role of
cannabinoid content in this process. Specifically, research shows that the endocannabinoid, arachidonoyl
ethanolamide (AEA), is negatively associated with anxiety and stress such that it may mediate the relationship
between cannabis use and stress reduction. Because the two main cannabis constituents, 9-delta
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), are associated with disparate effects on AEA, they may
differentially influence how cannabis use relates to stress. In particular, CBD may actually decrease stress
compared to THC via greater effects on AEA production. This study proposes to examine these research
questions with four aims. The first will experimentally test a causal relationship between cannabis use for
coping purposes and quantity of cannabis use (i.e., if more cannabis is used after stress induction compared to
a control condition among individuals who endorse cannabis use for coping purposes). The second will test if
the relationship between stress and cannabis use is stronger for individuals with social anxiety and/or poorer
inhibitory control. The third will test if cannabis use after stress is related to decreases in subjective and
objective stress. The fourth will ask whether decreases in stress are mediated via increased AEA, and if this
indirect relationship is stronger with greater CBD to THC product ratios. Knowledge gained from this study will
have significant public health impact including aiding in intervention and prevention efforts for cannabis misuse
and contributing data on the harm reduction potential of CBD."
10810475,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Intestinal homeostasis, which is paramount to maintaining human health and preventing inflammatory bowel
diseases (IBDs), relies on the ability of the immune system to react to pathogens while tolerating commensal
microbes. Although much has been learned regarding the mechanisms that regulate immunity at this mucosal
site, this system is quite complex and many aspects of how the host ensures proper responses remain elusive.
Recent work indicates that various cells of the immune system utilize a novel mode of communication that is
mediated by small lipid extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes. Following their release from cells,
exosomes have been shown to bind target recipient cells and deliver their cargo, including microRNAs
(miRNAs), to change cellular functions. Despite decades of knowing that exosomes exist, work in this field has
been hampered by a lack of mouse mutants that have impaired exosome production. Moreover, even less is
known about the functional roles of exosomes within the gut. Recently, the small GTPases Rab27a/b have
been shown to be critical for the release of exosomes, and dysregulated expression of Rab27 is associated
with human colitis and colon cancer. Our preliminary data indicate that genetic deletion of Rab27a in CD11c+
macrophages (Macs) and dendritic cells (DCs) leads to inflammation in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, while
injection of dendritic cell exosomes containing miRNAs can rescue this phenotype. We hypothesize that
Rab27a-dependent, Ybx1-loaded exosomes produced by Cd11c+ Macs/DCs of the GI tract regulate
inflammation during colitis by delivering specific regulatory miRNAs to gut cells. We will carry out the following
aims to explore this prediction and gain a deeper understanding about the functional relevance of exosomes in
the prevention of intestinal inflammation. Aim 1 will determine functionally relevant CD11c+ exosome
producing Mac/DC cell subsets during intestinal inflammation. Aim 2 will determine the role of Ybx1 during
colitis, and its contribution to CD11c+ Mac/DC exosome contents. Aim 3 will determine the functional
consequences of CD11c+ Mac/DC exosome delivery of specific miRNAs to cells of the GI tract during colitis.
This work will lead to groundbreaking insights into the roles played by EVs in the GI tract during human health
and disease."

 Bacterial keratitis is a serious public health threat associated with significant ocular morbidity and is one of
the major causes of blindness worldwide. By one estimate, the annual incidence of bacterial keratitis is
approximately 500,000 patients worldwide. Even with modern day treatment, corneal infections can result in
poor vision in 50% and surgical intervention in 12% of patients. Several Gram-positive and Gram-negative
bacterial pathogens can infect the cornea and cause keratitis. Bacterial pathogens use all resources available
to survive in the hostile host environment. Subversion of host extracellular matrix (ECM) components and their
receptors as attachment sites is thought to be a common virulence mechanism shared by many bacteria.
However, there are few data that clearly support this idea in vivo. We found in preliminary studies that deletion
of syndecan-1 (Sdc1), a major cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) of epithelial cells, causes a
gain of function in a mouse model of scarified corneal infection, where Sdc1-/- corneas are significantly less
susceptible to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. Topical administration of excess Sdc1 ectodomains or
heparan sulfate (HS) significantly inhibits S. pneumoniae corneal infection, suggesting that HS chains of Sdc1
promote infection as a cell surface attachment receptor. However, S. pneumoniae does not interact with Sdc1
and Sdc1 is shed upon S. pneumoniae infection, indicating that Sdc1 does not directly support S. pneumoniae
adhesion. Instead, Sdc1 promotes S. pneumoniae adhesion by driving the assembly of fibronectin (FN) fibrils
in the corneal basement membrane to which S. pneumoniae attaches when infecting injured corneas. Excess
Sdc1 ectodomains inhibit S. pneumoniae corneal infection by binding to the heparin-binding domain in FN, and
interfering with S. pneumoniae binding to FN. Based on these data, this proposal will examine the overall
hypothesis that specific ECM interactions coordinate the assembly of corneal basement membranes, and that
certain bacterial pathogens of the ocular surface exploit these normal biological processes to promote their
pathogenesis. This hypothesis will be tested in 3 Specific Aims. Aim 1 will define the structural basis of how HS
inhibits bacterial corneal infection. Aim 2 will determine the significance and relevance of bacteria-induced
Sdc1 shedding in corneal infection, and Aim 3 will elucidate the underlying mechanisms of how Sdc1 regulates
FN fibrillogenesis in the corneal basement membrane. These studies are expected to uncover previously
unknown functions of the ECM in the cornea and to establish a new integrated virulence pathway in bacterial
keratitis."
10815489,"Project Summary/Abstract (REC)
Safety net health care organizations play a central role in caring for medically underserved communities and
vulnerable populations. Conducting high-quality, cost effectiveness research (CER) and patient-centered
outcomes research (PCOR) in these settings is critical to promoting health equity in underserved, vulnerable
groups. However, safety net health systems commonly lack the infrastructure and personnel necessary to
undertake data-intensive research, such as CER and PCOR, and to disseminate evidence-based practices,
including quality performance management, rigorous data capture, analysis, and reporting. In the absence of
research studies explicitly designed to identify and address the unique circumstances and needs of traditionally
underrepresented groups, health disparities in these populations will persist. To support the Southwest Safety
Net Learning Health System in its overall goal to reduce health disparities and improve health equity for
historically disadvantaged populations, the REC will recruit, engage, and train diverse LHS Scholars
embedded in our safety net health systems to conduct inclusive, patient-centered research that improves
outcomes for our most vulnerable and promotes sustained practice change. The REC will support the System
by providing mentorship and training that is personalized to the needs, experiences, and goals of each Scholar
and building a broader network of clinician, the “Rapid Implementers”, who become champions for translating
generated CER and PCOR evidence into practice. Our team is uniquely qualified to lead this effort. Led by
faculty with extensive experience leading and engaging in research training and mentoring programs, the REC
will build on ASU’s past experience as a PCORnet partner to develop a strong personalized training and
mentoring program for Scholars embedded in the under-resourced institutions in our community. ASU faculty at
CHS and beyond have extensive experience mentoring and supporting trainees at all levels, and our safety net
organization partners have a long-standing history of leveraging PCOR and CER principles. Building on ASU’s
world-class educational infrastructure in systems science, informatics, data science, ethics, health equity, and
dissemination and implementation science, aligned with our extensive network of safety net partnerships, we
will prepare a cadre of Embedded LHS Scholars to lead patient-centered outcome research focused on
improving health equity among high-risk priority patient populations. In parallel, we will develop a diverse,
inclusive network of LHS champion clinicians, “Rapid Implementers'', who will be trained to implement PCOR
and CER in clinical care delivery through experiential learning and immersion opportunities. Supported by an
excellent mentoring and training infrastructure, Scholars will conduct research within the context of safety net
institutions, ensuring that the evidence generated is built with and for underserved populations, and
encompasses principles of equity, inclusion, and accessibility."
10815490,"Project Summary (RDAC)
Clinical experts providing care in safety-net systems frequently operate in low-resource settings, without an
analytics team to conduct analyses that could improve the quality of care, improve patient safety, and reduce
costs. Yet the insights these dedicated experts have about system improvements are limitless, if only they had
resources such as time, analytics training, and data resources to implement interventions and test hypotheses
using the most rigorous research methods.
This application for the College of Health Solutions at Arizona State University’s Research Data Analysis Core
(RDAC) will address important gaps in research applications for clinical and research scientists that build on
the insights they have developed during their work in these systems. The RDAC will be the hub of rigorous
research activities for LHS Scholars in the Center and will be the location where Scholars will be able to
practice and expand the skills learned in courses and where mentorship activities will come to fruition. Scholars
will participate in several projects through the RDAC, including a chance to serve as an apprentice to an
on-going project and a chance to lead a project in a protected community of Scholars, giving Scholars the
chance to practice the tools and approaches for conducting rigorous research. The RDAC will bring together
the advanced analysis capabilities of ASU’s Center for Health Information and Research (CHiR) with
experienced CER/PCOR researchers, data scientists, health economists, and biostatisticians.
Barriers to implementation and dissemination of timely and impactful research projects to improve the
knowledge base of treatment options for safety net systems will be achieved by the RDAC through the
following specific aims: (1) curate and maintain a rich data repository, comprising health care claims,
encounters, and clinical data, to support high-quality CER/PCOR research; (2) Improve access for LHS
Scholars to use and analyze high-quality clinical and non-clinical data to conduct impactful and rigorous
CER/PCOR research.; (3) develop and deploy a dissemination strategy to promote rapid uptake of CER/PCOR
findings among relevant stakeholders in the local research and clinical community and nationwide. By
achieving these three aims, the RDAC will help create a new generation of research Scholars who are
addressing the most important topics in health equity among populations that have not been well-served by the
nation’s health care system.

10814813,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major health problem; 2.5 million Americans sustain TBI each year at a cost of
80 billion dollars annually. Few therapies reduce long-term cognitive sequelae of TBI, and there are only
limited options for rehabilitation. Brain injury causes a primary structural injury followed by a secondary phase,
which involves the activation of the innate and adaptive immune systems. Neuroinflammation with microglia’s
involvement has been identified as a major contributor to the pathogenesis of TBI. However, there is still no
effective immune therapy to modulate the microglial response post-injury. Nasal administration of anti-CD3
monoclonal antibody induces an anti-inflammatory immune response that down-regulates microglial activation
in animal models of multiple sclerosis. The mechanism involves localization of nasal anti-CD3 to cervical lymph
nodes where it induces IL-10-secreting (CD4+LAP+ and CD4+FoxP3+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) that migrate
to the brain and inhibit microglial activation. Nasal anti-CD3 therapy is an unexplored area in TBI, and the
mechanisms by which Tregs modulate microglia in TBI are largely unknown. Dr. Saef Izzy, a trained
neurointensivist with a background in acute brain injury research, hypothesized that nasal anti-CD3 represents
a unique, clinically applicable immunomodulatory approach for the treatment of TBI. Dr. Izzy worked closely
with his primary mentor, Dr. Howard Weiner, to investigate the effects of nasal anti-CD3 on TBI outcomes in
mice. His preliminary data showed that nasal anti-CD3 increases CD4+Tregs and IL 10 expression and
reduces microglial activation in the brain 7 days after controlled cortical impact injury (CCI). It also improves
behavioral outcomes at 1-month post-injury. In this K08 proposal, Dr. Izzy will determine the effects of nasal
anti-CD3 on long-term histopathological and behavioral outcomes after CCI (Aim 1). He will survey the
microglial, effector, and regulatory T cell responses after injury and study the effects of Tregs on microglial
inflammatory response in vitro after CCI (Aim 2). He will investigate the effect of nasal anti-CD3 on IL-10/IL-
10R signaling in microglia using a C57BL6/J mouse harboring IL-10Rflox/floxTMEM119CreETR2, which does not
express the IL-10 receptor on microglia after tamoxifen administration. He will also delineate the role(s) of
other anti-inflammatory cytokines produced by Tregs by neutralizing TGF-β and IL-4 in vitro and in vivo and
study their effects on behavior and microglial inflammatory response post-CCI (Aim 3). Dr. Izzy's career goal is
to better understand how the adaptive immune response interfaces with the innate immune system after TBI.
Successful completion of this proposal will provide insight into the mechanisms by which Tregs modulate the
microglial response after TBI and the identification of novel immune-based therapeutics to improve patients’
outcomes. The proposed K08 application leverages Dr. Izzy’s mentor’s expertise in immunology, mouse
models of acute brain injury, and bioinformatics to provide him with the additional knowledge and experience
necessary to become an independent NIH-funded investigator and expert in the neuroimmunology of TBI."
10814814,"PROJECT SUMMARY The highest priority recommended by NINDS for clinical Parkinson’s research is
to define “the features and natural history of prodromal Parkinson disease (PPD), including the events
that underlie phenoconversion to clinically manifest PD, and biomarkers or other determinants of
prodromal subtypes with the goal of providing sufficient rationale to initiate proof-of-concept prevention
trials....” We are in a privileged position to address this priority by leveraging 25 years of research on
PD in the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS), large
cohorts of women and men recruited in mid-adult life and followed prospectively for over 30 years. In
2012, we screened the active participants in these cohorts for probable REM sleep behavior disorder
(pRBD) and constipation, and selected a sub-cohort enriched for these features for further investigation
(the ProPD cohort). This sub-cohort included 20,455 individuals who have so far completed two
olfactory tests and two comprehensive mailed surveys of non-motor and early motor features of PPD,
and have been actively followed until 2018. We are now proposing to extend the longitudinal follow-up
of this unique cohort and its source population to monitor the progression of prodromal features and
phenoconversion to clinically manifest PD (“phenoconversion”, for brevity), thus providing important
insights on the course of PPD and fill the gap between current knowledge and what we need to know
for implementing prevention trials. Further, as part of the proposed project, we will examine the impact
of covid-19 on PPD and its progression and collect new biological samples to evaluate the sebum
volatilome and metabolome, novel promising and non-invasive biomarkers that could play an important
role in the early identification of PPD. The Aims of the study include: i) to obtain an in-depth descriptive
characterization of PPD and its heterogeneity; ii) to identify risk factors for PPD progression and
phenoconversion; iii) to assess the impact of SARS-Cov2/covid-19 on features of prodromal PD and
phenoconversion; and iv) to evaluate the relationship between the sebum volatilome and metabolome
with prodromal features and manifest PD (sebum samples will be collected from individuals with high
probability of PPD, manifest PD, and matched controls). A unique and virtually irreproducible strength
of the proposed study are the data prospectively collected since mid-adult life (men were 40 to 65 at
recruitment, women 30 to 55) on lifestyle and medical history, including risk factors for PD and several
features associated with PPD. If funded, the proposed study stands to lead to groundbreaking
discoveries and create an invaluable resource that will offer numerous opportunities for further in-depth
investigations on PPD and its determinants. Most importantly, the information generated by the
proposed investigation will be pivotal to assess the feasibility of prevention trials and inform their design."

The era of “big data” has opened the door for genomic and systems biology approaches to be applied to
current challenges in life sciences and precision medicine. One critical challenge in these areas is how to
prioritize research findings to validate and identify actionable insights that can translate into better outcomes
for patients. In this regard, we have assembled a multidisciplinary group of scientists and physicians from
academia and industry with a focus on creating discovery pipelines that combine high-throughput profiling
technologies with advanced statistical and machine learning approaches to generate predictive tools that
enable us to move rapidly from big data to better diagnoses and treatment. In this regard, we propose to apply
these approaches to develop a computational clinical decision tool that will improve disease forecasting and
treatment plans for Multiple Myeloma (MM), an incurable cancer that originates in bone marrow plasma cells
and affects more than 30,000 patients a year. Though there have been some advances in the number and
diversity of available therapeutic options for these patients, relapse remains inevitable, and MM ultimately
remains a terminal diagnosis. The clinical assay and computational pipeline developed in this project will
combine a targeted sequencing panel specific to myeloma patients and clonality estimates with RNA-
sequencing and drug repurposing to expand therapeutic options for MM patients. We will develop this unique
tool with the following specific aims: (1) Develop an integrated genomic clinical decision tool to guide precision
treatment of MM and validate therapy recommendations using PDX profiling, and (2) Validate MM precision
medicine platform in a prospective clinical trial and generate clone-specific treatment recommendations. To
achieve these objectives, we will integrate a Cancer Genetic, Inc.'s FOCUS::Myeloma panel, a targeted panel
designed to specifically interrogateall the genes and copy number alterations commonly altered in myeloma,
and into a computational drug selection pipeline that utilizes RNA-sequencing data
and drug repurposing algorithms to generate therapeutic recommendations matched to a patient's unique
disease profile. These recommendations will be validated in mouse avatars of myeloma to confirm and refine
drug predictions. We will implement our assay in a prospective clinical trial of 100 patients to determine if the
treatment decisions generated by our pipeline achieves an improvement in standard-of-care. Finally, we will
perform clonal modeling on relapsed patients to retrospectively evaluate clone-specific treatment responses.
Completion of these studies will result in a clinic-ready assay and computational tool that will guide MM
precision treatment decisions and inform new therapeutic strategies based on a patient's unique cancer profile.

The opioid epidemic in the United States is profound, with an annual economic burden of $95.8 billion dollars
(2016 dollars) and a total cost of over $1Trillion since 2001. Moreover, drug overdose is now the no. 1 cause of
accidental death with over 72,000 lives lost in 2017, and opioid overdoses account for over 60% of these deaths.
In order to develop pharmacological and behavioral therapies to treat opioid use disorder (OUD), it is important
to understand the neural circuitry and neuroadaptation that occurs following opioid use and withdrawal. Disorders
on the affective spectrum often exhibit high comorbidity. Therefore, it is imperative to understand how opioids
alter critical circuits and neurotransmitters that regulate addiction-like behaviors, aversion/anxiety and the
response to stress. A node in the extended amygdala, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), receives
the densest innervation of norepinephrine (NE, a stress responsive neurotransmitter) in the brain. The BNST is
a major contributor to opioid withdrawal behaviors and previously, we demonstrated that morphine exposure and
withdrawal modulates BNST NE release and uptake mechanisms in rats. Our preliminary data demonstrate that
chronic stress enhances the same noradrenergic circuitry mice, and that opioid exposure and withdrawal
modulates NE neurons. Furthermore, in mice we observe sex specific acute withdrawal behaviors, withdrawal
induced disruption of sleep rhythms, and anxiety-like behavior in protracted abstinence. The BNST is a sexually
dimorphic brain region, and we observe further sex differences in (and some similarities) in BNST physiology.
Intriguingly, our data suggest that there may be reductions in excitatory transmission in select circuitry following
opioid withdrawal, which may ultimately alter BNST output to classical reward circuits. These data inform the
central hypothesis of our proposal investigated in 3 aims: opioid withdrawal 1. enhances the synaptic drive onto
NE neurons innervating the BNST, 2. facilitates enhanced noradrenergic transmission within the BNST, and 3.
induces glutamatergic plasticity within the BNST intensifying opioid withdrawal syndrome related behaviors."
10814956,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The bottleneck for tauopathy therapy development is the lack of validated tauopathy models, mouse, cell or in vitro.
This is reflected in the current reality that tauopathy-specific fibril structures solved by cryo-EM from post mortem
patient brain tissue have never been replicated outside a patient, i.e. not in a mouse, cell or in vitro. While the patient-
derived tauopathy fibrils offer critical goal posts, they are not in and of themselves viable therapeutic targets. For
example, the development of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) ligands to diagnose and track Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) or corticobasal degeneration (CBD) disease progression relies on screening small molecule binding to CBD- or
AD-phenotypic fibrils—the very construct that nobody knows how to build yet. There are many more factors to consider
for replicating the pathological pathway of tau aggregation, but replicating disease phenotypic tau fibrils is a minimal
and necessary requirement, and so far an unattained tool for therapy development. The major knowledge gap that
this proposal aims to close is the mechanism and tools to replicate tauopathy specific fibrils in vitro (Aim 1),
and the key cellular and molecular factors that initiate misfolding of tau in cell to disease phenotypic shapes
and facilitate aggregation (Aim 2). If we can successfully replicate any one tauopathy-phenotypic tau fold, or even
a part of a folded tau structure, such as a mini-hairpin fold of CBD or AD with seeding competency, it will have an
immediate impact on ongoing therapy developments, such as on the development of tauopathy-specific PET ligands,
antibodies and small molecule drugs. This team will employ an innovative set of structural biology tools encompassing
pulsed double electron-electron resonance (DEER), TEM and cryo-EM, as well as computational tools to focus on
capturing the full folding and aggregation pathway of the tau protein ensemble from its intrinsically disordered to
partially folded and fully converged fibril states. This team will concurrently use innovative cell biological tools with a
strong premise of the knowledge of a dedicated tau receptor and transporter that can enhance tau seeding by
endosomal escape and the knowledge that enhanced hydrophobicity of the local environment of tau is a potent factor
to initiate misfolding, aggregation and propagation. While discovering the defining property of a competent seed and
achieving shape propagation with seeds developed in this proposal will be a breakthrough, independent of this
success, we will have developed experimental and computational tools to evaluate whether seeded shape
propagation has occurred, or whether all, part, or none of the shape propagates. To have the tools to evaluate the
mechanism of shape propagation will be a game changer. The lack of progress in closing the above-described
knowledge gap is not due to a lack of investment by top notch laboratories around the world, but due to shortcomings
of existing concepts and tools. Han and Kosik, together with Shea, will rely on the convergence of their respective
fields and investing concerted effort using innovative tools to address long-standing questions in tauopathy research."
10814958,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Losses in protein homeostasis associated with accumulation of damaged, misfolded and aggregated proteins is
a characteristic feature of aging and many age-related neurodegenerative diseases. We hypothesize that this
may in part be driven by age-related dysfunctions in autophagy which establishes a prodromal process resulting
in decreased protein homeostasis and subsequent neurodegeneration. Growing evidence suggests that reduced
activity of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis, could
underlie many neurodegenerative diseases. Based on these findings, we conducted a chemical screen in a
neuronal cell line for chemical compounds that induce TFEB. We identified a series of compounds that induce
TFEB and its targets to levels far exceeding that produced by the classic TFEB inducer rapamycin. Our lead
compound `C1' was tested across a wide range of proteotoxic disease models including in the nematode C.
elegans, in in vitro human neuronal tauopathy models, and in an in vivo mouse model of Parkinson's disease
(PD). In conjunction with elevations in autophagic flux, the compound was found to prevent the formation of
neurotoxic proteins aggregates and enhanced mitochondrial function. Subsequent genetic and biochemical
analysis shows that C1 induces TFEB by acting as a “reverse agonist” of the nuclear hormone receptor DAF-
12/FXR, validated via the use of known modulators of DAF-12/FXR. Although FXR is best known for its ability to
act in the liver and gut to maintain lipid homeostasis, it has recently been shown to be present in brain neurons
although its role in here is currently unexplored. Our results highlight a novel previously uncharacterized role for
FXR-TFEB signaling-mediated autophagy in age-associated neurodegenerative diseases. Based on these
results, we hypothesize that neuronal FXR mechanistically acts to modulate levels of TFEB-mediated autophagy
and as such constitutes a novel target for the treatment of age-related neurodegenerative diseases including
Alzheimer's disease (AD). To test this hypothesis, we propose to determine whether: (1) FXR inhibition results

The purpose of this proposed K-Award is to promote my development as an independent investigator; and
support my program of research involving new media to reduce sexually transmitted infections and improve
access to sexual health services for young Black males in urban settings, thereby improving a broad range of
health outcomes. As it stands, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], sexually
transmitted infections (STIs) are a significant health challenge facing the United States. Each year,
approximately 20 million individuals are diagnosed with an STI. STIs occur disproportionately in young people
ages 13-24. Within this population, young Black males between 18-24 endure compromised sexual
reproductive health (SRH) that is substandard compared to that of their non-Black peers. Recent evidence
documents the potential power of various forms of new media to promote safer sex behaviors and STI
prevention among this population. This study aims to examine if new media can positively inform,
educate, and reach young Black males, resulting in improved access to sexual reproductive healthcare
and safe sex behaviors. To achieve my career goals, I need additional training in (1) advanced
methodological training in data analysis, (2) mixed methods research (3) designing and implementing
interventions. The strong mentoring team will help to address my knowledge gaps and support my growth as
an independent investigator, ensuring that I reach each milestone during this rigorous process. The proposed
research will apply an innovative methodology. This includes conducting a secondary analysis from a
Barbershop-Based HIV/STD Risk Reduction for African American/Black Young Men (Aim 1), in-depth
interviewing, and social media data mining that will involve transcribing a large body of social media data using
natural language processing (Aim 2), and finally a pilot intervention to assess feasibility and acceptability that
will include a social media campaign and community partners in an urban setting who have contributed to the
current health promotion and risk reduction of this population (Aim 3). The intervention will be designed to be
easily disseminated and accessible in the community. At the conclusion, the optimized intervention will be
ready to be evaluated in a large-scale randomized controlled trial."
10816528,"Project Description
Multidrug efflux pumps as exemplified by AcrAB-TolC from Escherichia coli are the major contributors to clinical
antibiotic resistance in bacteria and to various adaptive responses during pathogenesis and chronic infections.
During the previous funding period, we made major advances in two areas: 1) understanding the molecular
mechanism of efflux pump assembly and the role of periplasmic membrane fusion proteins in multidrug efflux
across two membranes; and 2) the development of a synergistic computational and empirical approach to
discovering efflux pump inhibitors with novel mechanisms of action. We successfully applied these advances to
discover inhibitors that act in a novel way, by interacting with AcrA and inhibiting the assembly of the AcrAB-
TolC complex. These efflux pump inhibitors potentiate activities of multiple antibiotics in various bacteria. The
major goal of the proposed research is to establish the molecular mechanisms of the new efflux pump inhibitors
and to optimize these inhibitors for use in combination with specific antibiotics and against specific multidrug
resistant bacteria. The underlying hypothesis is that the broad potentiation activity of the discovered inhibitors is
caused by their unique mechanism that traps efflux pumps in a poorly assembled and leaky conformation. In the
proposed approach, biochemical, structural and kinetic experiments will be used synergistically with advanced
computations to characterize the mechanism of efflux pump inhibitors and to optimize inhibitors acting on efflux
pumps of multidrug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. To optimize inhibitors, we will apply what is to our
knowledge the most comprehensive platform available. The platform utilizes a set of strains with variable efflux
capacities and outer membrane permeability barriers and allows to establish structure-activity relationships
separately for efflux avoidance, inhibition and permeation across the outer membrane. Successful completion of
the proposed experiments will help design efflux pump inhibitors that would be effective even in the context of
multiple pumps and mechanisms of antibiotic resistance."

a Coordinating Center, and a Data Analysis and Informatics Resource Center.  In its first five years, under 
RFA-­DA-­15-­015, ABCD enrolled a diverse sample of 11,878 9-­10 year olds from across the consortium, and 
will track their biological and behavioral development through adolescence into young adulthood.   
 
All participants received a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-­of-­the-­art brain imaging,

 Anxiety symptom onset peaks in adolescence, with an estimated one in three teens experiencing
clinically-significant symptoms by age 18 years. Adolescent anxiety confers risk for adulthood anxiety
disorders, as well as poor outcomes in multiple domains including overall health and interpersonal functioning.
Over the past several decades, the social world of teens has been transformed by pervasive use of digital
media (e.g., social media, messaging apps) ingrained in daily life. Both adolescent anxiety and digital media
use have continued to become increasingly prevalent throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the
urgent need for rigorous investigations of longitudinal and mechanistic links between digital technology use
and mental health. Guided by three major gaps in the literature, the proposed study will (1) capture how youth
engage in digital media use in ways that facilitate or disrupt social connectedness, (2) examine when youth use
digital media in the context of momentary affect and anxiety in daily life, and (3) address why digital media use
may be beneficial or detrimental for some by examining mechanistic links among biobehavioral cognitive and
affective functioning, digital media use, and anxiety. In particular, adolescence is a critical period of
neurodevelopment in frontal-subcortical circuitry underlying emotion regulation, the implicit and explicit
processes by which we manage emotions, and a major predictor of anxiety disorders. This study will leverage
an innovative, multi-method (i.e., questionnaires, interviews, reaction time, eye-tracking, EEG) biobehavioral
assessment of emotion regulation coupled with ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of within-person
daily patterns of digital media use, emotional experiences, anxiety symptoms, and emotion regulation
measured longitudinally in teens. We will index youths' emotion regulation strengths and vulnerabilities by (1)
contextualizing emotion regulation within adolescents' daily life, (2) targeting both explicit and implicit
regulatory processes, and (3) capturing biobehavioral aspects of ER that reflect rapid attentional processes,
cognitive control, and flexibility. This work is in line with the Research Domain Criteria initiative to investigate
developmental change within ecologically-valid environments by integrating measurement across multiple
domains [(negative valence (potential threat), cognitive systems (attention, control), social processes
(communication, connectedness), arousal (affective states)] and across units of analysis (physiology,
behaviors, paradigms, self-reports). This research aligns with the NIH-wide strategic plan emphasizing the
need to illuminate the role of technology and media use in development and will contribute to NIMH's Objective
2 by furthering the interrogation of biobehavioral indicators related to anxiety symptom trajectories in youth.
Findings from this research have the potential to elucidate the impact of digital media use on vulnerable
individuals and inform recommendations for healthy technology use."
10798697,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The notion that people consume alcohol in order to regulate both positive (drink-to-enhance) and negative
(drink-to-cope) emotions is central to theories of the development and treatment of alcohol use disorder (AUD).
Evidence for affect regulation is robust from both experiments and people’s retrospective, global self-reports of
their drinking motives. However, evidence from ecological momentary assessment (EMA) studies have failed
to produce compelling evidence of affective regulation of alcohol use. A central problem is that affect regulation
theories are vague as to when, where, how, and for whom they are relevant, leading to potentially hundreds of
ways that these theories can be operationalized. The lack of empirical consensus means that studies designed
to test a single affect regulation hypothesis are ultimately less informative because they cannot rule out or rule
in plausible alternative hypotheses. We will test hypotheses across timescales, measures, persons, and
situations using an adaptive, multi-burst EMA design. Our design will allow us to weigh the evidence for the
most theoretically informed and empirically supported affect regulation hypotheses in the same dataset. Using
specification curve analysis in combination with cross-validation in a hold-out sample, we will be able to test
the robustness and generalizability of each hypothesis across hundreds of specifications of timescale, affect,
and alcohol outcomes. We will simultaneously test multiple specific and contextualized predictions of the
affect–alcohol use association that can inform etiological and intervention research. We aim to do this in a
large (n = 500) adult regular and hazardous drinkers collected across three sites who will complete three high
intensity bursts of EMAs (10 per day over 10 days. By using these data to compare all reasonable ways that
affect regulation may be specified, the proposed project will identify sets of hypotheses about affect regulation
of alcohol use that are either well supported by data, or which should no longer be investigated."
10931611,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Preterm birth remains a major cause of mortality and morbidity globally and in the United States. Fortunately,
over the past several decades, mortality has decreased such that survival is now over 90% in high income
countries. Unfortunately, commensurate improvements in neurodevelopmental outcomes of extremely preterm
infants (EP, born <28 weeks’ gestation) remain elusive, with more than 60% of survivors developing at least one
disability such as cerebral palsy, autism, ADHD, or cognitive, hearing, or visual impairment. There are no
targeted neuroprotective interventions for preterm infants in current clinical use, driving a significant clinical need
to develop therapies that reduce the mortality and long-term morbidity seen in EP infants. To evaluate promising
therapeutics in the preterm infant, we have developed complementary in vitro and in vivo techniques in the
developing ferret. Our preliminary data in the inflammation sensitized hypoxic-ischemic-hyperoxic (HIH) ferret
model of preterm brain injury shows injury patterns and behavioral changes consistent with those seen in infants
born prematurely. In cultured organotypic ferret brain slices exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), we
have also shown regionally dependent injury, similar to the preterm human, and regional and treatment-
dependent transcriptome changes associated with neuroprotection. The fact that we see regionally dependent
responses to therapy suggests that an optimal therapeutic approach will require combinatorial therapies to
provide global neuroprotection and improve long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. This is particularly
relevant considering the recent publication of the PENUT trial, which found no significant neuroprotective effect
of erythropoietin (Epo) monotherapy – one of the most promising therapies in the pipeline – in EP infants.
Organotypic brain slices can provide a platform to screen combinatorial therapeutics including their interactions.
For example, our preliminary data in EP-equivalent ferret brain slices shows Epo in combination with the anti-
inflammatory antibiotic azithromycin results in synergistic benefit in the subcortical white matter, a region that is
specifically at risk in EP infants, but this combination does not result in benefit in all brain regions. Building on
these findings, the objectives of our proposed research are to (1) determine the regional specificity and efficacy
of multiple promising neurotherapeutics in vitro, (2) evaluate combined neurotherapeutics to optimize regional
and global neuroprotection in vitro, and (3) develop a cocktail of neurotherapeutics optimizing neuroprotection
in vivo in a ferret model of EP brain injury. Our overarching hypotheses are that: (1) neurotherapeutics that
provide complementary region-specific neuroprotection in vitro will increase global neuroprotection in vivo, and
(2) that compared to monotherapy, combining complementary neurotherapeutics will result in greater
neuroprotection across the entire brain that persists into adolescence. Data resulting from this proposal could
support a clinical trial in this population for which no specific neuroprotective therapies are currently available."

DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair is essential to prevent persistent DNA damage,
counteract genome instability and suppress tumor development. The spatial organization of
DNA repair is critical to protect the genome from chromosome translocations and complex
rearrangements. Thus, it is critical to better understand the mechanisms underlying the
formation of DNA repair domains and the contribution of these domains to the maintenance of
genome stability and, ultimately, tumor suppression. Armed with novel tools to manipulate the
formation of homology-directed repair domains, we propose three specific aims to assess the
impact of perturbing their formation on DNA repair and genome stability: mutation generation
and chromosome rearrangements. First, we will investigate further how actin movements
generated by the WASP-ARP2/3 pathway participate in DSB repair domain formation using
ARP2/3 inhibition or clinically relevant mutations in WASP. Repair domains will be probed by
state-of-the-art microscopy as well as by chromosome conformation capture assays (Hi-C).
Next, we will assess the consequences of interfering with DNA repair domain formation on
genome stability, specifically on chromosome translocations arising from various genomic
insults: endonucleases, topoisomerase inhibitors and replication stressors. Finally, we will
define the mutational signatures associated with DSB repair domain defects using loss and gain
of function mutations in the WASP-ARP2/3 pathway. This project will greatly benefit from
conceptual and technical interactions with all other projects of the program. The proposed
experiments should provide an unprecedented level of understanding of the impact of the
spatial organization of the nucleus, i.e. repair domains, on genome stability and subsequent
tumor development."

A major challenge facing the future of human health is the rise of antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria. In 2017
the World Health Organization (WHO) published a list of twelve pathogens that will pose the greatest threat to
human health due to resistance to frontline treatments. The overall goal of this project will be to identify novel
fungal natural products that exhibit antibiotic activity towards the WHO pathogens. Natural products are
secondary metabolites produced by living organisms. These small molecule chemical entities have played an
important role in traditional medicine for thousands of years and are an essential part of the current therapeutic
arsenal for modern medicine. This project will achieve the overall goal through two areas of research. The first
area involves the development of a rapid dereplication method that reduces redundant fungal strains in culture
libraries to streamline biological screening. The second involves the identification of antibiotic drug-leads with
novel chemical scaffolds or that function through a unique antivirulence mechanism of action against the WHO
pathogens. Once completed, these two areas of research will be bridged to develop a fungal metabolite drug
discovery platform that will be used to promote future lines of biomedical research."

 Oral potentially preneoplastic diseases are common with worldwide prevalence of approximately 4%,
and millions of cases in the United States alone. A large subset of these harbor the histopathological features
of oral dysplasia, the lesions most likely to progress to oral squamous cell carcinoma. Despite years of
research on these lesions, the approach to management of these lesions is quite variable. In particular,
because we lack a clear molecular classification of these lesions, we do not have good, clinically applicable
biomarkers that predict which lesions are likely to progress to cancer (and therefore require treatment) and
which are likely to not progress (and therefore can be observed). Further, we lack a full understanding of the
identity of the mutations responsible for reprogramming cells from normal oral keratinocytes into dysplastic oral
keratinocytes, and subsequently to carcinoma cells. We also do not understand how these mutations interact
in order to give rise to dysplasia, or how this knowledge could be harnessed to generate novel therapeutic
approaches to oral dysplasia. The work proposed within this grant aims to address these questions. First, we
will perform next generation sequencing on a large panel of oral dysplasias in order to define the mutational
landscape of oral dysplasias in general. Next, we propose performing next generation sequencing on biopsies
from a group of patients followed longitudinally over the arc of years whose oral dysplasias ultimately
progressed to cancer. We next take advantage of novel gene editing systems in primary human oral
keratinocytes combined with optimized organotypic model systems to generate “designer” oral dysplastic

complete, this work will serve as the foundational data resource for the oral dysplasia research community, and
will introduce novel, flexible, and powerful model systems to address key questions in oral preneoplastic

 The overall goal of this proposal is to develop genetic and pharmacological interventions that will delay
the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). AD and other Related Dementias (ADRD) affect well
over 5 million people in the United States. By mid-century, these numbers are predicted to at least triple. Despite
this, there are no effective treatments for these devastating illnesses. The onset and progression of AD has been
linked to age-related changes in several critical physiological pathways including cellular and mitochondrial
metabolism and genomic stability. We propose the age-related decline in the efficacy of these pathways
promotes AD-related neurodegeneration and interventions which improve and stabilize physiological pathways
leading to extension of healthy life span will delay the onset and progression of AD. In this proposal we will use
the fly and mouse AD models in combination to determine whether potential genetic and pharmacological
geroprotectors known to extend life span or health span in flies and mice, through an enhancement of the activity
of cellular and mitochondrial metabolism or improvement in genomic stability, delay the onset and progression
of neurodegeneration and other AD-related phenotypes in AD models in mice and flies. The goal of these studies
is to identify new and novel genetic and pharmacological geroprotectors that can be translated for use in the
treatment of AD.
 We will use specific molecular genetic and pharmacological interventions known to extend life span in
flies or to extend health span in mice in the context of molecular genetic models of fly and mouse AD. The effect
of each intervention will be evaluated in two different fly AD models (neuronal-specific expression of human Aß42
or human tau) and the 5XFAD mouse AD model.
 We will test the hypotheses that: (i) genetic interventions known to improve cellular and mitochondrial
metabolism or genomic stability and to extend life span in flies or health span in mammals serve as
geroprotectors that can delay the onset and progression of the neurodegeneration associated phenotypes in the
fly and mouse models of AD and (ii) pharmacological interventions known to improve cellular and mitochondrial
metabolism or genomic stability and extend life span in flies or health span in mammals can delay the onset and
progression of the neurodegeneration associated phenotypes in the fly and mouse AD models.
 We will determine whether these interventions delay the onset and progression of a series of AD-related
neurodegeneration phenotypes including: (i) decline in whole organismal health (life span in flies, frailty in mice);
(ii) loss of neurobehavioral robustness or resilience (mobility and circadian rhythms in flies, a series of
neurobehavioral tests in mice); (iii) microscopic histological examination of neurodegeneration in the brain and
the retina of flies and gross and microscopic neuro-pathological examination of the relevant regions of the mouse
brain; and (iv) molecular changes in mice."
10785243,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Allostery, the phenomenon describing how the state of one site in a protein is coupled to
the state of a distal site, is a fundamental driver of functional evolution in protein families. It is
especially impactful in multimeric and multidomain proteins – those that arise from the
recombination of protein domains that are structurally and functionally distinct. The goal of this
proposal is to develop methods that combine computational and experimental approaches to
understand the role of allostery in establishing new functions by coupling enzymatic activity to
biological processes at the membrane. Insights gained in this work will enable us to better
understand how domain recombination has expanded the functional repertoires of protein
families, and will enable more efficient engineering of synthetic proteins.
 In Aim 1 of this proposal, I will leverage recent advances in machine learning and
computational geometry to develop more accurate generative models of protein families that
implicitly account for evolutionary processes that act upon them.
 In Aim 2, I will conduct a systematic investigation into sequence-function landscape of a
dimeric bacterial bicarbonate transporter that couples proton transport across the membrane to
enzymatic production of bicarbonate. Using deep mutational scans in the context of a
suppressor screen, I will identify sequence positions that decouple enzymatic activity from
proton transport and will use this knowledge to test structure-function hypotheses related to
allostery in this protein system.
 In Aim 3, I will use machine learning models fit to protein families to rationally design
focused deep mutational scans to explore allostery in human atrial natriuretic peptide receptors.
These receptors directly couple ligand binding to secondary messenger production in a single
polypeptide chain containing multiple distinct domains. Using information from evolution will help
me make more effective use of an experimentally limited mutational budget and will allow me to
interrogate the higher order interactions that are a hallmark of allosteric networks.
 My background in structural biology and subsequent training in biological machine
learning give me a unique perspective and skillset to tackle these challenging problems. The
engaging scientific environment at UC Berkeley, and the strong support of my mentors Dr. Yun
Song and Dr. David Savage will enable me to more seamlessly operate at the interface of
computation and experimentation in biology as I launch my independent research career."
10785251,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Hyperphosphorylation to the microtubule (MT) associated protein Tau is the primary driving force of Tau
aggregation, a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease. Tau binds to and stabilizes MTs, especially in
neuronal axons. Phosphorylation causes Tau to dissociate from MTs, thus destabilizing them while also
increasing the vulnerability of Tau to further phosphorylation and toxic aggregation. Yet, clinical trials aimed at
either stabilizing MTs or degrading phospho-Tau (pTau) have yet to succeed. A major caveat of these trials is
that they did not stabilize the interactions of specific Tau species to MTs, which is a feasible strategy to stabilizing
Tau function and preventing its toxic aggregation. It has been challenging to achieve this clinical goal because
there are critical gaps in the Alzheimer’s disease field in distinguishing pathological from functional pTau species,
and mapping dysregulation of the pathways that drive Tau toward its hyperphosphorylated state.
 Most Tau research to date has focused exclusively on the longest Tau isoform even though it is the least
abundant isoform in the brain. However, there are a total of 6 Tau isoforms in the brain, expressed at varying
protein levels. I have made several discoveries connecting phosphorylation of Tau to its function and dysfunction
in an isoform-dependent manner. I found that i) Tau isoforms have different phosphorylation levels in human
neurons, ii) pTau species that are associated with Alzheimer’s disease are also abundant and soluble in normal
developing brains, iii) phosphorylation regulates Tau-MT interactions and aggregation levels in an isoform-
dependent manner. These findings support my central hypothesis that phosphorylation impacts Tau-MT
interactions in an isoform-dependent manner (AIM 1), modulated by isoform-specific regulation of Tau-MT
interactions (AIM 2).
 While the study of Tau hyperphosphorylation is a rich field, many studies have been limited by Tau
overexpression systems and/or exclusive focus on pathology. Furthermore, high-throughput tools to test for
regulators of Tau-MT interactions were not available until recently. I will address these concerns by using new
technologies to contrast Tau function and pathology. I will receive training to apply CRISPR prime editing, a new
and highly efficient gene editing technique with reduced off-target effects, to endogenously edit phosphorylation
sites of interest to Tau to test for isoform-specific effects on its binding to MTs in neurons (AIM 1). Second, I will
apply a powerful new technology, pooled optical CRISPR screening, to identify trans-regulators that increase
dissociation of Tau from MTs. Optical screening allows for genotype-phenotype matching of virtually any
phenotype that can be imaged under a microscope. This aim will uncover both known and novel genetic risk
factors for Alzheimer’s disease, thus opening several avenues for my future studies beyond this proposal."
10785250,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Elastin is the major component of circumferential elastic lamellae that alternate with rings of smooth
muscle cells (SMC) to form lamellar units in arteries. Loss-of-function mutations in the elastin gene ELN in
humans cause supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS), which is characterized by aortic SMC accumulation and
subsequent lumen obstruction. SVAS occurs as an isolated entity or as part of Williams-Beuren Syndrome
(WBS). Defective elastic lamellae and excess SMC accumulation are also observed during physiological
closure of the ductus arteriosus (DA). Failure of DA closure (i.e., patent DA [PDA]) leads to blood flow
imbalance and subsequent mortality. SMC accumulation is essential for postnatal DA closure and thus
promoting SMC accumulation may provide a therapeutic potential for PDA. In contrast, SMC accumulation is
detrimental for patients with SVAS/WBS and some congenital heart diseases in which PDA maintains
pulmonary or systematic circulation. Although regulating SMC accumulation is desired in these elastin-
defective arteries, mechanistic links between defective elastic lamellae and SMC hyperproliferation in
SVAS/WBS and DA are not well elucidated. To address this key question, my postdoctoral studies focus on
elastin aortopathy (K99), and I will bridge these findings to DA biology during the independent phase (R00).
 My preliminary data demonstrate that sphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1), an enzyme that phosphorylates
sphingosine into a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), is the most upregulated gene in elastin mutant mouse
aortic SMCs at embryonic day 15.5. This day is when differential hyperproliferative SMCs are first observed in
Eln(-/-) aorta. Reduced ELN increases levels of SPHK1 in human aortic SMCs in culture and mouse aorta.
Upregulated SPHK1 is also observed in mouse and human DAs. Pharmacological inhibition of SPHK1
attenuates SMC proliferation and hypermuscularization in elastin-defective aorta and DA.
 Although sphingolipids play a key role in vascular development and remodeling, no prior studies have
evaluated the role of the sphingolipid pathway in elastin aortopathy or DA biology. SPHK-produced
S1P, a highly bioactive sphingolipid, binds and activates S1P receptors. I hypothesize that in the context of
SVAS or DA, defective elastin upregulates Sphk1 levels via transcription factors (TFs), leading to increased
S1P binding to S1PR1 and thus, SMC proliferation. This proposal has three specific aims: 1) elucidate role of
SPHK1 in hypermuscularization of elastin aortopathy (K99); 2) determine which TFs mediate elastin
deficiency-induced Sphk1 transcription (K99); and 3) delineate role of SPHK1 in DA closure (R00). These
studies will use induced pluripotent stem cells and aortic tissues from SVAS/WBS patients, chromatin
immunoprecipitation assay in human aortic SMCs, SMC-specific Sphk1 deletion in mice and S1PR1 signaling
transgenic mice. Since SPHK inhibitors are being tested clinically for cancer, modulating SPHK1 is an
intriguing therapeutic strategy that warrants intense investigation."

comparatively little is known about how that spatial knowledge is acquired in the first place. Here, we address
the important problem of how people learn and remember new environments. In particular, we aim to
investigate a fundamental type of spatial knowledge, the path connections between locations (‘graph
knowledge’). A topological graph consists of place nodes linked by path edges which could generate routes,
but without exact metric distances and angles, like a subway map. When it comes to learning spatial
knowledge, it seems intuitive that active navigation should facilitate, however, we do not yet understand the
mechanisms behind this advantage. Our overarching hypothesis is that interactions of a prefrontal-
hippocampal-striatal (PHS) circuit support graph learning, particularly during active decision making about
exploration. Combined with decision making and reinforcement learning mechanisms, the PHS pathway is
hypothesized to facilitate memory during learning. Based on this model, interactions and functional
communication within the PHS circuit are critical to new learning. The goals of this fundamental basic research
proposal are to 1) determine the trajectory of navigational learning, including both behavioral and brain network
dynamics, 2) identify the underlying brain mechanisms behind active decision making during graph learning,
and 3) answer fundamental questions about the relationship between decision making and memory. In
Specific Aim 1, we will determine exploration behaviors that facilitate graph learning. We will compare a
variety of graph structures, environmental openness, and scale to determine the robustness of graph learning.
In Specific Aim 2, we will use novel fMRI methods to examine changes in the formation of cohesive groups of
brain areas (‘communities’), harnessing the dynamics of learning. We will use this technique to identify brain
networks supporting active compared to passive learning. In Specific Aim 3, we will compare the brain
networks found in graph learning with those in non-spatial and non-Euclidean graphs. These studies will test
for brain networks common across different types of graphs, as well as those unique to spatial graphs. The
outcomes will provide insights into fundamental processes of navigation, learning, and memory, and will help
answer questions about learning beyond the realm of navigation. The PHS circuit is relevant to mental
disorders involving reinforcement and reward learning, including OCD, depression, and Parkinson’s Disease.
These studies will establish a vital link between spatial navigation and the PHS circuit, and will form the basis
for computational approaches to navigation, learning, memory, and breakdowns of the PHS circuit. The far-
reaching impact of this research includes assessing the function and dysfunction of this circuit in clinical
populations to better understand disease mechanisms."

Off-label medications are widely used in the clinical care of pediatric patients, with disproportionate use in
cardiovascular subspecialties. More than 75% of children with cardiovascular disease receive at least one off-
label medication. Further, congenital heart disease (CHD) patients requiring surgical repair are likely to receive
multiple off-label therapies, including antiarrhythmics (76% of prescribed medications), beta-blockers (97%),
adrenergic agents (85%) and Ca2+ channel blockers (96%). Since pediatric CHD populations are
underrepresented in preclinical and clinical studies, practitioners often rely on empirical data or adult data to
guide off-label prescription choice and/or extrapolate dosing regimens. As a result, cardiovascular drugs are
administered off-label to neonates, infants, and children with little consideration of myocardial immaturity. Indeed,
many cardiovascular medications have been shown to exert variable age-dependent outcomes and/or
undesirable adverse effects. A physiology-driven approach is urgently needed to inform and optimize age-
appropriate therapies for CHD patients, particularly in the neonatal – adolescent period when the myocardium
undergoes rapid adaptive changes.
In the proposed application, we will test the hypothesis that myocardial immaturity perturbs cardiac drug
responsiveness, as ion channel expression, calcium handling, and dopamine/adrenergic drug targets are
underdeveloped. Using innovative techniques, including large animal models and human cardiac tissue procured
during surgery, optical mapping of voltage and intracellular calcium, computational models, and transcriptomic
and proteomic profiling, we will address the following aims: 1) Determine the extent to which postnatal
development alters the transcriptomic, proteomic, and anatomical profile of the myocardium. 2) Investigate
pharmacodynamic responses to off-label antiarrhythmic and inotropic drugs in neonatal – juvenile hearts, in the
context of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). 3) Evaluate the impact of myocardial immaturity on clinical
responsiveness to drug therapies in CHD patients. This study addresses the objectives of PAR-20-300 by
establishing data on developmental pharmacodynamics using highly translational cardiac models and
mathematical modeling approaches. Results will inform clinical care decisions for CHD patients by providing
evidence on the safety, efficacy, and potency of antiarrhythmics and inotropes. Moreover, the methods and
models within this study are scalable to other drug therapies used in pediatric cardiology. Completion of this work
will enhance our understanding of postnatal cardiac development in the context of CHD, which can promote
tailored pharmacotherapies that are age- and disease-appropriate."
10789926,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chromosomal rearrangements of the proto-oncogene ROS1 produce constitutively active ROS1 kinase-fusion
proteins that are established as druggable pathogenic drivers in human cancer. Currently, this is the only
validated mechanism of aberrant ROS1 activation in oncogenesis. ROS1 is targetable with multiple tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (TKI), and significant tumor regression is observed in ROS1-fusion positive patients who are
treated with targeted TKI. Cancer genome sequencing studies reveal numerous ROS1 somatic mutations but
their impact on catalytic function has not been tested, prompting new questions about ROS1-driven cancer
pathogenesis. Further, the mechanistic role of ROS1 carboxy terminus in governing intra- or
intermolecular regulation is unknown. Broadly, these gaps in knowledge, regarding regulation of ROS1
and its structure-function relationships, impede meaningful utilization of accumulating cancer genome data.
Our overall hypothesis is that characterization of ROS1 tyrosine kinase and carboxy-terminal domains through
the lens of somatic mutations will unveil biological underpinnings of receptor regulation, and contribute to
translation of cancer genomic data. We will experimentally address this hypothesis by answering the following
questions:
(1) Do cancer-associated ROS1 tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations activate catalytic function, and
is this sufficient for neoplastic transformation or metastatic dissemination, either alone or in cooperation
with hotspot oncoproteins? Preliminary data offer proof of concept that an engineered activating ROS1 TKD
mutation transforms cells, and is targetable with ROS1-TKI. We will test if twenty prioritized somatic ROS1 TKD
mutations enhance catalytic function, induce cellular transformation and tumor formation, and assess their drug
sensitivity patterns.
(2) How does the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of ROS1 regulate protein stability and TKI-induced
protein downregulation? Our pilot data show that (a) ROS1 is ubiquitinated, (b) catalytically inactive ROS1
undergoes proteasome-assisted degradation, and (c) regulatory motifs within ROS1 CTD are likely involved.
Engineered ROS1 CTD truncations retain catalytic activity but exhibit longer protein half-life under steady state
and TKI-treated conditions. In Aim 2, we will map ubiquitination sites, track the cellular fate of ubiquitinated
ROS1, and assess impact of somatic CTD mutations on ROS1 function.
Cumulatively, I am confident that these studies will provide novel mechanistic insight into ROS1, and potentially
facilitate clinical translation of genomic sequencing data for expanded impact of ROS1-TKI."
10789945,"ABSTRACT
Neonatal sepsis results in more than 3 million deaths per annum worldwide and the highest risk of mortality
occurs in preterm infants (≤37 weeks). This increased vulnerability is due to altered myelopoiesis and an intrinsic
hypo-responsiveness to pathogens, concomitant with activation of immunosuppressive mechanisms that sustain
maternal-fetal tolerance. Following birth, the neonatal immune system undergoes transition from a semi-
allogeneic sterile condition to a microbial-rich postnatal environment, which is modulated in part by neonatal
myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) and innate immune effector cell responses. In newborns, the role of
MDSCs is highly controversial, as they may not only control inflammation during early microbial colonization, but
also contribute to neonatal susceptibility to infection by inducing immunosuppression. Innate immune effector
cell function is also aberrant in prematurity. Our overarching hypothesis is that the increased susceptibility to and
mortality from sepsis in preterm neonates can be explained in part by the presence of immature,
immunosuppressive myeloid cell populations (MDSCs) and deviant terminal differentiation of innate immune
effector cells (e.g. monocytes, PMNs). Furthermore, we propose that the prophylactic administration of
immunomodulatory agents early in life can stimulate host protective immunity by altering MDSC numbers and
function, leading to augmentation of innate immune effector cell numbers and function (especially PMNs). This
strategy will reduce the incidence and severity of microbial infections in this fragile ‘born-too-soon’ population.
The two specific aims are as follows: (1) to test the hypothesis that neonatal prematurity and sepsis in early life
induce MDSC expansion, which is inversely correlated with innate immune cell function. Circulating MDSCs
(CD33+CD11b+HLADRlow/-) will be quantified in 120 preterm and 40 full-term infants at birth and during
hospitalization and in those who develop sepsis. We will determine how human MDSC and PMN phenotypes
are influenced by gestational age and sepsis, as well as whether expansion of MDSCs and PMN dysfunction at
birth is beneficial or increases susceptibility to infections. (2) In complimentary studies that cannot be performed
in humans, we hypothesize that myelopoiesis and myeloid function (especially MDSCs) can be influenced to
differentiate into functional terminal innate immune effector cells by the administration of immunomodulatory
agents. Using a model of neonatal sepsis, we will test the role of MDSCs in immune cell effector functions and
outcomes to sepsis through the induction of non-specific effects (NSEs) or ‘trained immunity’. In summary, the
proposed studies will focus on mechanisms critical to regulate neonatal immune responses in neonates. With
the use of -omics technology, we expect to provide: 1) a global view of changes that myeloid populations undergo
in preterm neonates during hospitalization and sepsis, and 2) insights into underlying mechanisms of how
immunomodulation through the use of adjuvants (BCG and TLR4 agonists) influences myeloid cells and prevents
sepsis in this highly vulnerable population."

The primary objective of this proposal is to facilitate the development of Dr. Brachova into an independent
research scientist. This objective will be accomplished through a combination of active mentorship, didactic
training, enrichment activities, and research. The mentorship phase is well described by her mentors and
includes weekly contact and formal course work. The core of the research focuses on the role of a post-
transcriptional regulation mechanism known as RNA editing in overall oocyte quality. Defects in oocyte growth
and meiotic maturation represent a significant cause of human birth defects, miscarriage, and infertility. The
contribution of RNA post-transcriptional modifications is emerging as an important regulator of RNA stability
and oocyte quality, however the role of adenosine deaminase acting on double stranded RNA (ADAR1), which
catalyzes the deamination of an adenosine (A) into inosine (I) remains unexplored. The goal of this research
is to determine the effect of ADAR1 RNA editing on RNA stability and oocyte competence in young and
old mice. Preliminary data show that ADARFL/FLZP3-Cre oocytes have reduced embryonic developmental
potential, suggesting that ADAR1 is a novel factor that contributes to female fertility. We also show that
oocytes and eggs from aged individuals have reduced RNA editing efficiency, suggesting that RNA editing
deficiencies could be involved in female age-associated decline of fertility. The central hypothesis is that
ADAR1 RNA editing is a novel mechanism for maintaining female fertility through the regulation of RNA
stability during oocyte growth and early embryonic development. The hypothesis will be tested in two
independent specific aims. Specific Aim 1 will assess the role of ADAR1 A-to-I RNA editing in the regulation of
maternal mRNA dosage in the oocyte and early embryo. Specific Aim 2 will determine how ADAR1 A-to-I RNA
editing effects mRNA degradation in oocytes. The proposed research will utilize oocytes and eggs from young
and maternally aged mice to explore the role of A-to-I editing in oogenesis and age-related reduction in fertility.
This proposal represents an innovative approach to study oocyte competence, and has the potential to expand
our understanding of female fertility. Furthermore, the studies proposed herein are integral to enhance the
scientific training of Dr. Brachova and enable her to accomplish her goal of achieving independence and
becoming an independent scientist in the field of female reproduction."

 Lung metastasis is the 2nd most common metastasis and accounts for 30% of all metastatic diseases in
human cancer patients. Patients with lung metastases have a very short survival time. For example, the 5-
year survival rate for colorectal cancer patients with lung metastases, if left untreated, is only 5%. Surgical
lung metastases resection (pulmonary metastasectomy) is a “curative” treatment for cancer patients with lung
metastases. For example, pulmonary metastasectomy increases the 5-year survival rate of colorectal cancer
patients with lung metastases from 50.3-66%. However, pulmonary metastasectomy is currently performed
only in a very small population of cancer patients with lung metastases due to the risk-related highly selective
criteria. For example, only 5% of colorectal cancer patients with lung metastases are treated with pulmonary
metastasectomy. A neoadjuvant therapy that can effectively reduce lung metastases number and/or size is
therefore expected to significantly increase the eligible patient population for this life-saving pulmonary
metastasectomy. ChemMedImmune Inc. is developing IFNA2-LNP001, a lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated
IFN2-encoding mini-plasmid DNA for treatment of patients with lung metastases. IFNA2-LNP01 will be
administered in the clinically neoadjuvant setting, where it activates the type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling
pathways in lung metastases to increase the expression of T cell chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10, resulting
in enhanced T cell recruitment to the tumor site to reduce the size and number of lung metastases. A key
differentiating feature of IFNA2-LNP01 is its administration in the neoadjuvant setting, which is necessary to
give patients the best chance to fight their metastatic tumor ahead of other lines of therapies that can
negatively affect T cells. IFNA2-LNP01 is designed based on our recent published data showing that loss of
IFN-I expression and function is a major mechanism underlying lung metastases immune evasion and growth.
Two aims will be pursued in this project: 1) determine the efficacy of IFNA2-LNP01 in suppression of tumor
lung metastases in vivo; and 2) determine IFNA2-LNP01 biodistribution and toxicology in vivo. This project is
expected to generate sufficient efficacy and toxicology data for a Phase II IND-enabling study of IFNA2-
LNP01."
10820367,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 (HSV-1, -2) are epidemic worldwide. Globally, it has been estimated that
approximately 1.5 million cases of HSV-related ocular infection occur every year, with 40,000 of those ending
up with longstanding visual damage. The virus’s ability to spread through airborne droplets contributes to its
high degree of transmissibility, often leading to blinding corneal ulcers. Current standards of care include
concurrent treatment with anti-virals and corticosteroids, which are effective, but have side effects that can
compromise visual acuity. Similarly, during severe inflammatory conditions, corneal transplantation is required
to preserve vision. Therefore, there is a need to develop therapies that can prevent or reduce the ability of
HSV-1 to infect ocular surface epithelial cells, which would then mitigate subsequent inflammation and loss of
visual acuity. It has been suggested that molecules contributing to more than one step in the HSV life cycle
may serve more effectively as targets for new preventative or therapeutic drugs. Dynasore is a cell-permeant
small molecule developed to target the GTPase activities of classic dynamins, a family of molecules that
participate in several endocytic pathways and in several steps in the HSV life cycle. Indeed, dynasore has
been demonstrated to have pleiotropic effects against HSV infection, including inhibition of cell uptake,
intracellular trafficking, capsid assembly, and cell-to-cell spread. The applicant company recently undertook a
project to develop dynasore analogues to protect against epitheliopathy in dry eye (DE) disease. The team
identified 3 lead compounds that inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis with greater potency than dynasore.
Two of the leads are novel chemical entities (NCEs) substantially different from dynasore, thus are likely to be
patentable. Importantly, the team now demonstrates their antiviral effect specifically against HSV infection of
corneal mucosal epithelial cells in culture, although with different rank potencies than for cytoprotection. The
goal of this proposal is to refine the structure-activity relationship for antiviral effect against HSV. From this
screen, up to 5 lead compounds with optimized anti-HSV1 profiles will be selected. Then, using a mouse
model of HSK, the most efficacious compound(s) will be identified to take forward for further development.
Following completion of this Phase I effort, the team will have defined the SAR for inhibition of HSV-1 infection
and HSK in a mouse model. During Phase II, the team will prepare additional compounds to evaluate
absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) properties as well as physicochemical and
pharmacokinetic (PK) measurements. Finally, the team will fine tune the formulation and dosage to maximize
efficacy, shelf life and ease of application, while decreasing any toxic or off-target effects."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most common in the United States, as the sixth leading cause of death
among those 65 or older, and impairing the quality of life for 6.2 million adults as of late 2020. As the population
ages, the number of AD patients is expected to grow to over 13.8 million by late 2060 without the development
of more effective treatments, straining the capacity of both Medicare and the US caregiving system with the
direct costs of AD estimated at $244B and care-giving estimated to reach $305B by 2050. The primary
biochemical characteristic of AD is the presence of beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles,
primarily composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, in the brain. The only FDA approved disease-modifying
treatment for AD is Aduhelm, an anti-Ab monoclonal antibody (mAb) that clears Abeta deposits in the AD brain
despite not significantly improving cognition. However, its approval has boosted other mAb efforts, including
drugs targeting tau tangles, instead of beta amyloid plaques. Aeton has identified ac-tau as a compelling target
for mAb treatment of tauopathy in AD and is developing a mAb based treatment. This pathogenic tau modification
is highly expressed in the AD brain when compared to healthy controls, The lab of Aeton’s co-founder, Dr. Li
Gan, has developed several murine mAbs that strongly bind to the ac-K174 tau protein, effectively reducing
taupathy in mouse models. This reduction protected the hippocampus, a region key for memory and learning,
from typical AD atrophy, reducing cognitive defects in a mouse model of AD. Aeton has licensed these mAbs for
development, humanizing 9 clones to function similarly in human tissue and producing a leading candidate, AT-
01. In this Phase I SBIR application, Aeton has two specific aims: 1) Evaluate the effectiveness of AT-01 in
treating in vitro neural cells and organoids in head-to-head comparisons with another anti-tau mAb, HJ8.7, 2)
Determine the efficacy and safety of AT-01 against HJ8.7 in a mouse model of tauopathy while evaluating its
pharmokinetics and dynamics. At this point, Aeton will evaluate the success of AT-01, determining if it reduces
tauopathy by blocking spread and aggregation via targeting the ac-K174 epitope. In a future Phase II application,
Aeton would then continue evaluation of AT-01 by initiating IND-enabling studies of efficacy and safety. This
Phase I proposal would enable the development of an anti-tau monoclonal antibody treatment for Alzheimer’s
disease, with an eye towards clinical translation."
10824355,"Obesity, a long-standing pandemic in the United States, is associated with an increased risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is the most common chronic liver disease globally, affecting about one third of adults, for which there is no approved medication. The first stage of NAFLD is steatosis (fatty liver), a condition that can progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) where fat accumulation in the liver is associated with inflammation, fibrosis and scarring, resulting in the eventual loss of liver function. There is therefore a dire need to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of fatty liver and NASH to create the first identified targets for medication. The liver produces a peptide known as kisspeptin (KP), that signals by binding a G protein-coupled receptor, the kisspeptin 1 receptor (KISS1R) expressed in the liver. The metabolic functions of KISS1R signaling in the liver, however, are not known. We found that hepatic KP/KISS1R expression are upregulated in high fat diet induced mouse model of NAFLD. We also observed that when mice lacking hepatic KISS1R were challenged with high fat diet-feeding, they showed increased hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and an upregulation of inflammatory and fibrosis markers, compared to controls on the same diet. Taken together, this data led us to hypothesize that hepatic KISS1R activation suppresses hepatic lipogenesis thus limiting fat accumulation and NASH development. The proposed work will decipher the mechanisms by which KISS1R signaling inhibits fatty liver and NASH. In Aim 1, we will investigate the mechanisms by which hepatic KISS1R signaling modulates hepatic lipid levels by inhibiting lipogenesis. In Aim 2, we will assess the impact of enhancing KISS1R signaling on the development of NAFLD. In Aim 3, we will study the clinical relevance of KP/KISS1R signaling pathway by measuring plasma KP levels in healthy subjects, NAFLD and NASH patients and assess whether plasma KP levels correlate with metabolic disease severity and other anthropometric, laboratory, radiographic and demographic features. Additionally, the expression and localization of hepatic KISS1R in NAFLD/NASH liver biopsies will be examined. Understanding this knowledge is important because it will shed light on using the KISS1R signaling pathway as a potential avenue to develop a novel pharmacological approach to reduce NAFLD and NASH."

Core C will be responsible for the in-depth determination of the molecular composition, temporal dynamics and
functional properties of the antibodies that comprise the polyclonal response to influenza HA or to SARS-CoV2

comprehensive sequencing and functional analyses of the natively paired VH:VL BCR repertoire encoded by B
cell subsets of interest from peripheral blood, lymph node FNA, bone marrow aspirates and from respiratory
track specimens. Both the IgG and the IgA serological and BCR repertoires will be determined and compared.
Furthermore, we will analyze the immunoglobulin subclass repertoires. The studies by Core C will be enabled
by a set of technologies developed by the UT Austin team, namely Ig-Seq: bottom-up high resolution LC-MS/MS
based identification and quantification of antigen-specific circulating antibodies: BCR-Seq:very high throughput
sequencing of natively paired VH and VL cDNA from single B cells and HuRep: extensive functional analysis of
the B cell encoded repertoire displayed on yeast. Core C, together with Projects 1 and 2, will seek to address
a plethora of key questions on the humoral responses to infection by respiratory pathogens and also following
vaccination, including: (i) How does the sequence and functional diversity of the peripheral blood antibody
repertoire compares to those of respiratory track antibodies? (ii) What fraction of the mucosal antibodies develop
locally and are produced by tissue resident plasma cells versus being produced at other anatomical locations
and then exported to the respiratory track following transcytosis from peripheral blood? (iii) What is the temporal
persistence of individual IgG/IgA antibody clones in the respiratory track? (iv) To what extent does the
concentration of individual IgG antibodies in peripheral blood correlates with their level in the mucosa following
transcytosis via FcRn? Also, a related question is whether there exist abundant centrally produced antibodies
that are not found in the respiratory track, either because of poor transepithelial export or enhanced mucosal
elimination (e.g. due to proteolysis). (v) How do B cell clonal expansions in peripheral blood, lymph node
aspirates and in the bone marrow correlate with the concentration of the respective antibody in circulation and
in BALF? Finally, (iv) very importantly, together with Project 1 we will delineate the binding and neutralization
breadth of the dominant anti-HA or anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies in circulation and in the respiratory track."
10824364,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is prevalent among
breast cancer survivors. This is due to shared risk factors between CVD and cancer, but also that breast
cancer therapies are often cardiotoxic, which may later cause heart failure (HF). Cardiotoxicity from breast
cancer chemotherapy affects between 10-20% of patients with enhanced risk in the presence of traditional
CVD risk factors. However, there is a significant gap in our knowledge of cardiotoxicity among the rapidly
growing population of young and emerging adult (YEA) breast cancer survivors, which comprise 5-12% of all
breast cancer diagnoses. As survival from breast cancer increases, exposure to cardiotoxic chemotherapies at
a younger age may enhance HF risk among YEA breast cancer survivors. Moreover, YEA breast cancer
patients are more likely to have gene mutations that may also impair cardiac tissue function combined with a
unique pattern of health behaviors and CVD risk factors. However, we are currently unable to predict which
patients are at highest risk of cardiotoxicity. Studies suggest that gene expression may refine identification of
women at increased risk of cardiotoxicity. To date, no studies examined whether combining gene expression
and genetic mutations with CVD risk factors can identify YEA patients at increased risk of cardiotoxic effects of
chemotherapy. To address this issue, I will complete the following specific aims: 1) Develop a predictive model
combining psychosocial and traditional CVD risk factors to identify YEA breast cancer patients at increased
risk of cardiotoxicity as defined by a decline in global longitudinal strain (GLS) or left ventricular ejection
fraction (LVEF); 2) Investigate if the risk factor profile at diagnosis is associated with trajectory of GLS and
LVEF during and after breast cancer treatment; and 3) investigate the impact of molecular biomarkers to risk
prediction models. We will recruit a longitudinal cohort of n=300 YEA breast cancer patients treated at
Northwestern Medicine. Among these participants, in a nested case-control design, we will select cases
diagnosed with decline in GLS during chemotherapy (n=50) with age-matched controls without cardiotoxicity
(n=50). For all participants, we will combine electronic health record (EHR) data with psychosocial and
traditional CVD risk factors at three timepoints. For the nested case-control study, we will additionally measure
gene expression at two timepoints. This directly informs my short-term career development goals to 1) Gain
experience in HF and CVD etiology, epidemiology, and risk factors; 2) Develop skills in machine learning and
bioinformatics approaches for prediction; and 3) Refine health informatics methods to integrate EHR with
epidemiologic and molecular data. The skills and pilot data generated through this K01 will enable me to
address the NHLBI compelling question (5.CQ.10) to reduce cardiac morbidity and mortality in cancer
survivors. I will thus achieve my long-term career goal to identify and intervene on the CVD threats to the
health and longevity of YEA cancer survivors."

Global climate change is the most important issue humanity has faced. While this has been acknowledged by
scientists for years, educating the younger generation is paramount. The importance of teaching scientific data
interpretation has recently come to the forefront, with the emergence of polarizing social issues such as
vaccination. Similarly, environmental climate change is a contentious concept that requires the understanding of
climate data, projections, and mitigation strategies. Yet, a major frustration of educators, scientists and policy
makers surrounds the difficulty of getting effective, evidence-based learning approaches into widespread use in
the classroom. Implementing inquiry-based activities has in the past proved problematic because of the
complexity involved for the educator. Our proposal addresses this problem and the lack of innovative product
offering in climate education. The revolutionary EcoWell™ platform consists of hardware, dedicated curriculum
material and supporting infrastructure. The EcoWell™ is a small bench-top unit that converts a generic six-well
plate into six separate micro-incubators able to mimic aspects of climate change including global warming and
the greenhouse effect and terrestrial and aquatic pollution. Using the intuitive touchscreen interface, students
will be able to implement automated experimental protocols, download data and follow in-depth instructional
videos reducing burden on the educator. The EcoWell™ fully integrated system can be used to grow a range of
biological materials under different environmental conditions, in a single low-cost unit and that has numerous
applications in a range of core STEM subjects."
10825538,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Melanoma incidence rates continue to increase, whereas rates for most other cancers have
declined. Emerging systemic therapies for patients who have progressed to metastatic melanoma
are extending survival, but can be toxic, immensely costly and have variable efficacy. There are
efforts to extend the use of new agents to earlier disease stages as adjuvant therapies. Better
prediction of lethal melanoma at time of diagnosis is important to determine those who would
benefit from adjuvant therapies and, conversely, avoid toxicity in those whose melanomas are
unlikely to recur. Our central hypothesis is that it is possible to determine the combinations of
genetic alterations and immune responses in tumor samples that define a melanoma likely to be
ultimately lethal if not treated early. Conversely, we hypothesize that it will be possible to identify
somatic profiles of the tumors that indicate a very low risk of recurrence and ultimate death of the
patient, obviating the need for expensive, toxic treatments in such patients. We also hypothesize
that host characteristics, including germline variants in multiple genes, will be associated with
lethal melanoma. In Aim 1, we will test whether common somatic mutations in 104 genes/gene
regions in tumors are associated with death from melanoma. These genes include known
oncogenic drivers (BRAF, NRAS and TERT) and tumor suppressors (NF1, CDKN2A/CDKN2B,
PTEN and TP53). We will also test the hypothesis that measuring the immune cell milieu will add
information to survival prediction beyond conventional grading of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.
We will then explore how best to combine the genetic alterations, immune measures and 2018
American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor stage to identify those melanomas highly
likely to be ultimately lethal. In Aim 2, we will determine the extent to which the host characteristics
of germline variants, phenotypic characteristics, sun exposure, age and gender differ among
melanoma cases characterized as potentially lethal vs. nonlethal, leading to the identification of
a subset of the population at high risk for lethal melanoma. This research will be undertaken using
a resource that is uniquely suited to addressing these issues, the international, population-based
Genes, Environment and Melanoma (GEM) Study, which collected epidemiologic data, pathology
and tumor sections for a large cohort of incident primary cutaneous melanoma cases diagnosed
in the year 2000. We have available a minimum of 10 years of follow-up of vital status and cause
of death for all cases. GEM is an ideal resource because the end of the follow-up period precedes
the targeted and immune therapy era, allowing us to study factors affecting the natural history of
the disease. The vast majority of GEM cases (more than 85%) presented with local disease, and
we project that at least 80% of the deaths will occur in cases initially presenting with local or
regional disease. The results should enhance our ability to identify lethal melanomas at an early
stage when treatments may be more effective and, conversely, to identify melanomas with a very
low risk of recurrence for which unnecessary and potentially toxic treatments can be confidently
avoided."

specific mechanisms are hypothesized. An improved understanding is critical for developing new therapies to
treat or prevent this growing problem. This study builds upon a novel, established multinational (US and Uganda)
cohort of HIV+ persons. The study measured selected markers of immune activation, inflammation, lung injury,
and cellular aging in both blood and lung specimens. The study also performed lung function testing and
examined the associations between the selected markers and lung function. Our data show that different markers
are associated with different lung function abnormalities, suggesting that these lung function abnormalities may
be due to different underlying mechanisms. Interestingly, cytomegalovirus (CMV), which is a chronic viral
infection common in HIV+ persons, has been associated with the three markers most strongly associated with
one of the lung function abnormalities. These data lead to the following specific aims: Aims 1 and 2: To test the
hypothesis that persistent abnormalities in selected markers of immune activation, inflammation, lung injury, and
cellular aging measured in the blood are associated with subsequent changes (declines) in lung function and
that the specific markers associated with each lung function abnormality will be different. The longitudinal study
design will strengthen the causal inferences from our earlier work and will set the foundation for future trials of
therapeutic interventions, including the potential for personalized medicine with potentially novel and/or different
therapies for different biomarker and/or different lung function abnormalities. Aim 3. In a cross-sectional subset
of HIV+ participants selected to undergo bronchoscopy and collect lung specimens, to test the hypothesis that
abnormalities in the same markers but now measured in lung specimens are associated with abnormal lung
function and test the hypothesis that asymptomatic CMV co-infection is also associated with lung function
abnormalities and is mediated by these markers. This aim will determine whether CMV co-infection is involved
in lung function abnormalities and potentially set the stage for trials of anti-CMV therapy in HIV+ COPD. To
address these aims, we will conduct a longitudinal study of 400 HIV+ subjects (200 in the US and 200 in Uganda)
and collect and bank blood specimens at the same time as lung function testing. We will also perform
bronchoscopy in a subset of 80 subjects (40 in the US and 40 in Uganda) and collect and bank lung specimens
and specimens to assess for CMV co-infection at the same time as lung function testing. The banked specimens
will allow for efficient testing of new and novel markers in the future. Our long-term objective is to improve our
mechanistic understanding of lung function abnormalities seen in persons with HIV that would lead to a future
study that tests new treatments for this important and growing clinical problem."

The CAM Research Training in Neuroscience and Stress T32 program will continue to
utilize ongoing cross-institutional collaborations to provide a multidisciplinary setting for
training both basic and clinical CAM researchers. Oregon Health & Science University
formally houses the training grant and most of the faculty across multiple departments,
but some faculty have primary appointments at the Linus Pauling Institute at Oregon
State University and the National University of Natural Medicine. The CAM research
training program will build upon other NIH funded educational programs located at
Oregon Health & Science University and has access to many excellent core resources
including, most importantly, the Oregon Clinical and Translational Research Institute
that is sponsored by a Clinical and Translational Science Award. The positions funded
will be 6 positions per year for fellows recently obtaining a clinical doctorate degree or a
PhD, targeting approximately equal numbers of clinical and basic science researchers.
The mentors include many established researchers who have done funded research in
areas of CAM along with neuroscience or stress. There are additionally some less well-
established CAM researchers and well-established non-CAM researchers who will be
part of the program. To ensure adequate mentorship, those trainees wanting to do
research with these faculty will be assigned dual mentors to ensure high quality
research in a CAM-related project. This training program will continue the tradition of
cooperation amongst the CAM and neuroscience community in Oregon and at OHSU
that has led to strong research and educational programs and that fosters collaborations
across departments, schools and institutions. The specific activities of the T32 program
include coursework, a focused journal club, an annual retreat, and in depth research
training with mentors’ laboratories. Trainees will learn scientific writing, specific
research methodologies individualized for each trainee and have guidance on their
career planning. In addition, trainees coming from this program will have the ability to
interact with those who do CAM research in neuroscience or stress, be it at the cellular,
whole animal, or human level of analysis, and to understand the scientific literature from
all of these areas."
10825505,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The gene regulatory program of a cell reflects and largely determines cell state, and is a tightly regulated and
dynamic system. In the immune system, rapid changes in gene regulation are required during immune
responses, and also during specification and differentiation of different immune cell types. Indeed, many of the
most important regulatory proteins in immune cells are transcription factors, which specify the regulatory state
of a cell. Multiple genomic assays assess diverse aspects of gene regulation, and represent an important tool
set for modern biology research and biomedicine. Currently, multiple different genomic assays with distinct
readouts are often used in combination to generate comprehensive cell gene regulatory profiles, with a resulting
increase in cost, time, technical expertise and sample requirements. Here we propose to develop a single
multimodal assay optimized for low sample input, which will generate comprehensive gene regulatory information
traditionally only possible using multiple parallel assays. We will optimize the micro-PRO-seq (μPRO-seq) assay,
a next-generation sequencing methodology, which will generate three distinct genome-wide readouts: (i) a
comprehensive and quantitative measure of gene synthesis, achieved by detecting nascent RNA molecules; (ii)
quantitative detection genome-wide of active enhancers, the regulatory elements in the genome that specify
gene synthesis by binding transcription factors; and, (iii) identification of all genes existing in a poised state,
representing a novel mode of gene regulation that positions genes to respond rapidly to activation. This
combination of data has broad applicability, with particular utility for dynamic cell types such as primary immune
cells. By detecting only newly synthesized nascent RNAs, μPRO-seq generates a more accurate snapshot of
actively expressed genes than other technologies – a readout that better reflects response to stimulus or change
in differentiation state. A major goal of modern immunology research, with increasing clinical relevance, is the
identification of the specific transcription factors responsible for immune responses and differentiation across
myriad different immune cell types. μPRO-seq is highly responsive to this demand, in that it directly identifies
active enhancers, which together with the established sequence binding motifs for most transcription factors,
thereby efficiently identifies candidate transcription factors that regulate genes central to immunologic cell fate.
The main objectives of this proposal are to (i) develop and optimize μPRO-seq as a sample-sparing assay, (ii)
establish the utility of μPRO-seq using a panel of different human T cell subsets isolated from male and females
across a range of ages, and (iii) develop informatics tools to maximize the utility of μPRO-seq data for
immunology research and clinical diagnostics. Accomplishing our aims will produce a robust, multimodal,
sample-sparing assay with multiple genome-wide readouts, which in combination produce an unparalleled and
comprehensive delineation of immunologic gene regulatory status."
10825506,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) called for action towards achieving the global elimination of
cervical cancer. A strategy for achieving this goal was ratified by member states in August 2020. The WHO
plan calls for an aggressive approach of vaccination, screening, and treatment of the human papillomavirus
(HPV), the single cause of cervical cancer. In low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), which bear 90% of the
incidence and mortality of cervical cancer globally, it is estimated that these goals will not be reached until
2120 – a century from now. One way to markedly shorten this timeline is through HPV self-sampling and
immediate treatment for those who screen positive. In order to scale-up HPV there must be a low-cost,
effective test that is easy to use in the field. An optimal field test would allow women to collect their own
samples without compromising efficacy. The only WHO prequalified test specifically developed for low
resource settings is careHPV, which has relatively good sensitivity when a sample is taken by a clinician, but
which performs poorly when self-sampled. There is an urgent need for evaluation of a low-cost self-
sampling test that is effective and can be easily implemented in LMIC. AmpFire® (Atila Biosystems, CA),
a new low-cost HPV test, has demonstrated high sensitivity in self-collected samples and may perform better
than provider-collected careHPV. Furthermore, the current protocol for careHPV requires a 2-day visit because
the machines are in a central location and require 3-4 hours for processing. AmpFire® can be run from local
locations using a battery-operated PCR machine. Since these tests process in approximately 1 hour, a single-
visit approach is feasible, which is more efficient for the health system and more convenient for patients. The
purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of AmpFire® versus careHPV for the detection of high grade
precancer (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, grade 2 or higher, or CIN2+) and to compare the efficacy and
feasibility of each test through the following aims: Aim 1: To compare self-collected AmpFire® to standard
provider-collected careHPV for the detection of high grade cervical precancer. Aim 2: Demonstrate
that a single-visit approach using self-collected AmpFire® will result in lower loss to follow-up than the
current conventional two-visit approach using provider-collected careHPV. Aim 3: Perform a cost-
effectiveness analysis to compare efficacy, loss to follow-up and generalizability of self-sampled
AmpFire® HPV versus provider-collected careHPV."
10825507,"Project Summary / Abstract:
Many neuroscience studies have shown that specific cell types within a brain network have unique
contributions to behavioral output and that even a single neuron makes connections to large portions of the
brain. Therefore, in order to truly get at the problem of uncovering brain function we need measurements with
cellular specificity across the whole brain during behavior. As such, due to technological limitations, our current
understanding of global brain circuit mechanisms is extremely limited. My recent development of optogenetic
functional magnetic resonance imaging (ofMRI) technology provides a partial solution. However, challenges
still remain: how do you non-invasively deliver cell type specific neuromodulation? How do you image the
whole brain function in freely moving subjects? In this Pioneer Award proposal, I propose a novel approach
that enables non-invasive, cell type specific, whole mammalian brain imaging in freely moving subjects. In
particular, we propose to develop a non-invasive cell type specific stimulation in mammalian brain termed
“Mechanogenetics” and a functional ultrasound (fUS) imaging technology that can image whole brain function
in awake-behaving animals. Mechanogenetics will utilize mechanosensitive ion channels expressed in
selective cell types enabling neuromodulation using mechanical deflection from ultrasound probes delivered
non-invasively instead of using optical probes that need to be surgically implanted. For imaging, miniaturized
functional ultrasound technologies with high-resolution, 3D real-time imaging capability that can be mountable
on the subject's head will be developed. The resulting “Mechanogenetic functional ultrasound (MfUS)”
technology will enable non-invasive flexible modulation of neuronal populations while the impact of such
modulation can be monitored in freely moving animals across the whole brain with high spatiotemporal
resolution. Instead of measuring large-scale neuronal activity associated with binary behavioral readout or
complex behaviors related to single neuronal populations, my goal is to establish a new paradigm for
understanding brain function, where cell type specific whole brain function during behavior can be monitored
continuously. With such data, combined with computational modeling, whole brain algorithms of behavioral
control can be constructed. Furthermore, the Mechanogenetics technology can bring cell type specific
neuromodulation closer to human translation. Functional ultrasound technology development will also enable
human brain function monitoring in non-laboratory settings. This will ultimately enable brain circuits to be
engineered the way electrical engineers engineer electronic circuits allowing direct treatment of neurological
disease including Alzheimer's disease and related dementias or directly manage pain addressing the opioid
crisis."
10825510,"The mission of the Society for Investigative Dermatology (SID) is ‘To advance and promote the sciences
relevant to skin health and disease through education, advocacy, and scholarly exchange of scientific
information.’ Part of this mission is to ensure there is an adequate pipeline of educators and researchers
to foster the next generation. Over the past few decades, there is a notable shortage of Academic
Dermatologists in the United States. Among the 127 ACGME accredited Dermatology residency
programs in the US, a relatively small percentage of graduating residents indicate an interest in
academic medicine and teaching the next generation. Members of the SID represent a significant
percentage of U.S. dermatology faculty. The SID is uniquely suited to address the problem given its
access to both faculty and resident physicians. The SID mission and that of the National Institute for
Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) are largely overlapping. Both are committed to
supporting skin disease research and training basic and clinical investigators. The two organizations
have a vested interest maintaining a pipeline of dermatology educators and researchers. To leverage
potential synergy in the missions of the SID and NIAMS, the SID Retreat was developed. The SID
Retreat is an annual conference presented by the SID for a select group of first, and second-year
dermatology residents and PhD-trained post-doctoral fellows who have expressed an interest in a career
in academics. The program tests the hypothesis that early and sustained exposure to like-minded
residents, post-docs and seasoned faculty will have a positive effect on a decision to enter academia. To
achieve our goals, we will continue to expand upon the format utilized over the past 20 years, which
included discussions of grant writing, finding mentors, negotiating a job (and protected time), economics,
work-life balance, developing an interest area, integrating academics into dermatologic specialties,
finding funding, and how to form meaningful collaborative liaisons between MD- and PhD-trained
scientists, educators and clinicians. New recruitment strategies will be used in this iteration of the SID
Retreat to enhance and grow our Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) initiatives, to increase the URM pipeline,
to retain people of color, and to synergize with existing D&I initiatives ongoing within in the SID. This
retreat provides scientific and educational opportunities for future leaders in dermatology and supports
the core values of the SID. Outcome analyses measured by retention in academia supports the SID
Retreat as effective at promoting increases in academic retention."
10825511,"Project Summary/ Abstract
The proposed work will integrate two long-standing lines of research in the laboratory. One is to
understand is to understand how the many types of ion channels present in a single neuron
work together to regulate its firing pattern. In earlier grant periods, we focused on the individual
gating behavior and functional roles of various kinds of calcium channels, sodium channels, and
potassium channels in different kinds of mammalian neurons. More recently, we have tried to
understand how the currents through the many kinds of channels in a given neuronal type
interact, often in surprising ways, to control the firing pattern of the neuron. In a second line of
research, we have characterized a variety of pharmacological agents that are targeted to
voltage-dependent channels. Much of this work originally focused on finding peptide toxins and
small molecules useful for separating components of current from specific channel types. Our
goal now is to use our expanding knowledge about the differences in ion channel make-up of
different kinds of neurons to rationally design novel compounds that can inhibit (or enhance)
activity of specific kinds of neurons. Hypothesizing that it is no accident that many clinically-
effective drugs act on multiple ion channels, we will attempt to design single compounds
deliberately designed to inhibit or enhance specific combinations of voltage-dependent sodium,
potassium, and calcium channels to differentially depress (or enhance) firing of specific neuronal
types of interest, including primary nociceptors, hippocampal and cortical pyramidal neurons,
various populations of cortical and hippocampal GABAergic neurons, and spinal cord motor
neurons, in ways designed to have clinically beneficial effects. A key element of our approach is
realizing that almost all small-molecule compounds targeted to voltage-dependent channels
interact differentially with different gating states of the channels, resulting in complex
dependence on voltage waveforms. Thus, differential inhibition of different neuronal types can
be based on their different resting potentials, action potential shapes, and firing patterns as well
as presence or absence of particular channel types being targeted. Our previous experience
with a range of cell types, channel types, and channel-targeted drugs will provide a strong
foundation for this effort."
10825512,"Summary
In the past, new diseases were delineated when clinicians brought together a cohort of individuals with similar
phenotypic characteristics. They then performed genetic testing and looked for shared genetic changes among
the affected cohort. While this method proved successful in some cases, discovery was limited to disorders
with relatively few genes and highly distinctive presentation. Since the advent of exome sequencing,
physicians have become increasingly aware of the wide spectrum of variability of clinical features associated
with previously known genes, with the actual manifestations attributable to a genetic variation being far greater
than what was previously anticipated--the proverbial, “iceberg effect.” Overcoming these challenges requires a
new approach. Instead of starting with the defined phenotype, we propose starting at the gene and working our
way forward to identify the full spectrum of phenotypes that can arise from these genetic variations. Such work
requires high numbers of well-phenotyped and genotyped samples, as well as the expertise to appropriately
evaluate patients of interest. This application brings together two institutions with the experience and capability
to do just that. The Geisinger Health System maintains extensive medical records and genotype and sequence
data on more than 141,000 participants enrolled in the MyCode Community Health Initiative and has the
expertise to mine those records and genomic sequences for meaningful and medically relevant associations.
The NIH has expertise in the deep phenotyping and discovery in rare disease. For proof of principle that this
gene-first strategy works, we are beginning our analysis into elastic fiber mediated connective tissue disease,
an area with which our NIH collaborators have significant expertise. Previous literature linked changes in
elastic fiber genes to defects in aortic diameter and tortuosity, lung changes such as emphysema and skin
changes including laxity with more recent work suggesting connections to more common phenotypes such as
hypertension, intracranial aneurysm, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Our goal is to define all
phenotypes, rare and common, associated with elastic fiber disease and to investigate the mechanism by
which variation in these genes produces phenotypes in order to develop novel treatment strategies. In order to
achieve this goal, we have developed two specific aims combining the strengths of Geisinger and the National
Institutes of Health investigators. Aim 1. A) Screen an unselected population for variants in elastin and other
elastic fiber genes and B) correlate with phenotypic features mined from the electronic health record. Aim 2:
Identify previously unidentified phenotypes in patients with known and novel damaging variants in elastic fiber
genes through deep phenotyping and disease modeling in vitro functional analysis. Collaboration between the
two institution's diverse and multidisciplinary teams will increase understanding about the impact of elastic fiber
disease and provide insight leading to treatment of human disease."
10825513,"Treatment of metastatic melanoma with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) has extended the life of many melanoma
patients, but the vast majority of patient experience disease progression, prompting the need for alternate therapies.
For ~50% of patients with BRAFmut tumors, treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors provide a good second-line
treatment option. Unfortunately, there are few second-line options for the 25-30% of patients whose tumors harbor
NRAS mutations. Since nearly 40% of all melanoma patients exhibit loss, mutation, or epigenetic silencing of the
CDK4/6 regulator CDKN2A, we postulate that inhibition of CDK4/6 may induce response in NRASmut RBWT tumors
with loss of CDKN2A. Because loss of CDKN2A also disrupts ARF, a suppressor of MDM2-mediated degradation of
p53, it will be essential to also inhibit MDM2 to restore cell cycle control in p53WT melanoma. We have shown that
NRASmut melanoma tumors with acquired resistance to ICI respond to co-treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor plus an
MDM2, demonstrating both with reduced tumor growth and enhanced CD8+T cell recruitment into the tumor. These
tumors contain a significant number of CXCR1,2 expressing myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) that create
an immune suppressive tumor microenvironment. Our preliminary data show that when CXCR2 is deleted in myeloid
cells, MDSC recruitment to tumor is reduced and tumor growth is inhibited. Moreover, systemic delivery of a CXCR1,2
inhibitor reduced the growth of NRASmut melanoma in mice (p<0.02), and inducible deletion of CXCR2 in melanocytes
blocks melanoma formation in the inducible BRAFV600E/PTEN-/- melanoma mouse model. These intriguing findings
support prior studies indicating a role for CXCR2 inhibitors for treatment of melanoma. However, the mechanisms
and generality of response to CXCR1,2 antagonism require further elucidation. Premise and Hypothesis: CXCR2
plays critical and pleotropic role in melanoma by promoting tumorigenesis and inducing an immunosuppressive tumor
environment. Moreover, combined CDK4/6 and MDM2 inhibition significantly inhibits the growth of mouse and human
NRASmut melanoma tumors. We hypothesize that co-inhibition of CXCR1,2, CDK4/6, and MDM2 in NRASmut
melanoma with acquired resistance to ICI will inhibit tumor cell proliferation, induce tumor cell death, stimulate anti-
tumor immunity, and potentially overcome the acquired resistance to ICI. We propose 3 specific aims. 1)To examine
the ability of CDK4/6i plus MDM2i, combined with a CXCR1,2 antagonist treatment, or CXCR1,2 agonist alone, to
enhance or restore ICI sensitivity for NRASmut melanoma tumors. 2) To determine the role of melanocyte-expressed
CXCR2 in melanoma initiation. CXCR2 will be deleted coincident with induction of melanoma formation in mice and
effects of this deletion on melanocyte apoptosis, senescence, differentiation and proliferation will be characterized.
3) To determine whether findings in mouse translate to human melanoma, changes in the tumor immune
microenvironment (TIME) will be characterized over time in response to a CXCR1,2 antagonist (CXCR1,2i) with or
without CDK4/6i+MDM2i followed by ICI therapy in humanized NRASmut patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and
human NRAS mut melanoma organoid co-cultures. These data will inform future clinical trials."
10825620,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Substance use disorders (SUDs), particularly those involving opioids, have reached epidemic levels. SUDs
are hypothesized to be learning and memory disorders: the association of drug ‘reward’ with otherwise neutral
stimuli promotes continued or reinstated drug use (relapse) when similar stimuli are re-encountered. Relapse
rates are 40-60%, suggesting that previously learned drug associations are a constant risk for those recovering
from SUDs. Socially-mediated learning is ubiquitous across species, and social factors also modulate drug use.
However, how social factors influence drug-associated learning, and its expression once established, is unclear.
The nucleus accumbens (NAc) reward region is critical for both drug associative learning and for social influence
over behavior. We determined that microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, mediate social development
via phagocytosis, or “pruning,” of synaptic proteins in the NAc core during early adolescence in male rats, and
pre-adolescence in females. Adolescent drug use increases SUD risk and social dysfunction later in life; in fact,
even prescription opioid use in adolescence increases opioid misuse later in life. The opioid morphine directly
activates a pro-phagocytic receptor on microglia, including on NAc microglia. These data raise the possibility
that adolescent opioid use increases SUD risk by changing microglia-mediated NAc and social development,
and in turn social influence over reward learning.
 In this proposal, we will restrict short-term morphine exposure to each sex-specific NAc core pruning period
in adolescence to determine (1) how morphine affects ongoing developmental synaptic pruning activity, (2) social
development, and (3) socially-mediated reward learning. Our core hypothesis is that adolescent morphine
exposure exacerbates microglia-mediated pruning in the NAc core, causing abnormal social development and
increased social influence over reward learning. This proposal will be the first to examine a mechanistic
relationship between social development in adolescence and reward learning in adulthood, and may identify sex-
specific adolescent periods of vulnerability during which lifetime SUD risk and other mental health disorders can
be influenced."
10790646,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Background. Among social factors affecting vulnerability to mental illness, family is key, and the quality of care
that parents provide for their children perhaps being the most strategic. However, it is still unclear whether the
early childhood parenting support programs offer later mental health benefits for the child; and if they do, which
mechanisms explain the association between early parenting support programs and mental health at school age.
Specifically, it is not well understood how family social factors (e.g., parent sense of self-efficacy, family
dynamics, quality of caregiving environment, school attendance) are associated with mental health outcomes in
childhood. Therefore, in this project we will evaluate the long-term effect of a parenting support program on child
mental health outcomes at school age, and test the impacts of social family, maternal mental health, and child
growth factors as predictors of longer-term child mental health. We will conduct a 3-year observational
longitudinal follow-up assessment (once each year) of 100 children whose mothers previously completed the
year-long biweekly mediational intervention for sensitizing caregivers (MISC), and 114 children whose mothers
were randomized to the No MISC (treatment as usual) arm. Specific Aims for this study are: Aim 1: To evaluate
long-term mental health outcomes (e.g., executive functioning/self-regulation, emotional responses, social
communication, emotion regulation behaviors in caregiver-child interactions) of the MISC intervention among
school-age children living in the DR Congo 5 years after their mothers received MISC or no MISC training. Child
mental health outcomes will be evaluated annually for 3 consecutive years with a range of validated and direct
measures (video recordings of parent/child interactions, psychopathology checklists, eye tracking measures of
child response to short video vignettes of child caregiving interactions). We hypothesize that children of mothers
who received MISC intervention will have more positive psychosocial and eye tracking based emotional
outcomes at school age compared to children of mothers who did not receive MISC. Aim 2: To examine the
family social, child growth, and maternal mental health factors gathered both in early childhood during the MISC
trial, and again in the proposed follow-up study, as simultaneous or consecutive mediators of the MISC effects
on child mental health. We will also evaluate these factors as independent predictors of child mental health
outcomes at 5-12 years of age. Findings on indirect effects of MISC through these factors or their effects
independent of MISC will help guide future efforts on how to best enhance the trajectory of mental health from
early to middle childhood. Aim 3: Controlling for the receipt of the MISC intervention, assess longitudinal dyadic
interdependence of maternal and child mental health outcomes to determine if there are reciprocating effects
between mother and child mental health over time. Overall Impact. Establishing how early childhood parenting
support reduces psychopathology -- along with the family social, child growth, and maternal mental health factors
driving this process -- will sustainably enhance child mental health in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)."

The objective of the activities proposed in this application is to provide spectral-domain optical
coherence tomography (SD-OCT) Reading Center support to the NAC Attack study. This project's
primary goal is to identify by OCT the effect of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) compared to control
treatment on progression of retinitis pigmentosa from baseline to study end, as assessed by the
cumulative loss in foveal-centered ellipsoid zone (EZ) length. An exploratory goal is to determine
NAC's effect, when compared to control, on the cumulative loss of the EZ area.
The primary and exploratory objectives will be accomplished through the following specific aims:
Specific Aim 1: Provide the infrastructure to process SD-OCT images submitted by NAC Attack
clinical sites to the OCT Reading Center.
Specific Aim 2: Train and certify NAC Attack clinical site personnel on methods to acquire and
transmit images to the OCT Reading Center.
Specific Aim 3: Provide Reliable, Timely, Reproducible, and Systematic Grading of submitted
SD-OCT.
To achieve these aims, we will use in-house developed, validated, and 21 CFR 21-compliant
stand-alone web-based systems to provide secure methods for clinical sites to transmit electronic
SD-OCT data to the OCT Reading Center, to store and back-up submitted data, assign the
images to be graded to Reader, and to provide electronic data entry forms into which Readers
will enter their image quality assessment data. Readers will use our custom-developed and
validated software to manually grade the foveal EZ length and automatically quantify the EZ area
in the assigned images. The foveal EZ length and EZ area data will be exported directly from
software into a database that will be transferred to the Coordinating Center through a secure
portal. The OCT Reading Center will also implement materials and methods for Reader and
clinical site OCT technician certification and training, rigorous quality control for manual and
automatic gradings, and support study goals as an image resource for recruitment, Study Group
meetings, presentations, and publications."
10809043,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a psychiatric illness characterized by both distorted self-image and a
restriction of energy intake relative to requirements, leading to significantly low body weight, and
frequently resulting in severe medical complications. As such, numerous physiological changes
in people with AN have been observed, including differences in both immunological and
gastrointestinal function during the disease. However, these changes have not yet been related
to the cognitive and behavioral symptoms observed during AN. This K23 Mentored Career
Development Award proposal is a first step to address this gap in the literature. Our proposed
research project will evaluate both immune dysregulation and gut microbiome composition
in women with AN and healthy comparison participants. In Aim 1, we characterize the
molecular components of inflammation by assessing both basal and innate cytokine production
capacity. In Aim 2, we evaluate the composition of the gut microbiome and its relationship to
eating disorder symptoms. Lastly we will explore (Aim 3) whether alterations in gut microbiome
composition correlate with inflammatory marker levels. The career development portion of this
award provides the PI with detailed training in 1) gut microbiome-immune system research; 2)
psychopathology research methods necessary to conduct independent research investigating
biomarkers in eating disorders; 3) translational science design, implementation and
management; and 4) responsible conduct of research. An expert team of mentors and advisors
will oversee both research and training aims, including an on-site primary mentor with expertise
in eating disorders and translational science, Dr. Carrie McAdams, and an on-site co-mentor
with expertise in how gut microbiome modulates host immune responses, Dr. Andrew Koh. Dr.
Cynthia Bulik, a scientific advisor, will provide mentorship on relating biomarkers with complex
human behaviors seen in psychiatric illness. Two additional scientific advisors, Dr. Robert
Haley (expertise in biostatistics in relation to neuroimmunology) and Dr. Larry Borish
(expertise on immune function and inflammatory pathways) complete the mentorship team.
The research and training outlined in this proposal will provide crucial formal and experiential
training to allow the PI, a board certified internist with a strong research background in
gastrointestinal physiology and immunology, to develop into an independent translational
physician-scientist."
10809044,"Project Summary/Abstract
The goal of this revised R01 is to determine how a hypothalamic region integrates and then processes
hormone and CNS metabolic cues to affect sex-dependent physical activity behavior in female mice. We
showed previously that loss of hormone-responsive neurons in the medial basal hypothalamus (MBH)
diminishes activity only in female mice. In new work, we discovered that a small, discrete cluster of
melanocortin 4 receptor (Mc4r)-expressing neurons in the ventrolateral region of the ventromedial
hypothalamus (VMHvlMC4R neurons) increases female activity and promotes weight loss when activated.
Increasing dosage of Mc4r in the VMHvl of wild type female mice by CRISPRa increases distance traveled
leading to weight loss when pair-fed with control mice.
Here, we will ask if this VMHvlMC4R node can be exploited to mitigate age-related and environmental-
induced metabolic challenges and also define the mechanistic pathway and circuits responsible for
regulating this module. Aim 1 will ask if the VMHvlMC4R node depends on hormones, can improve metabolic
deficits, and whether silencing this node (inhibitory DREADDs) results in lowered physical activity
behaviors. Aim 2 will confirm that Mc4r is an integral part of this node and define other signaling
components that participate in the VMHvlMC4R activity node. Aim 3 will address the physiological
consequences of melanocortin and estrogen signaling in modulating VMHvlMC4R neuron activity by
electrophysiology brain slice recordings with the Gao lab (Yale) and begin mapping inputs that interact
with VMHvlMC4R neurons. We posit that this ancillary VMHvlMC4R female-module disengages in states of low
or no estrogen (estrus or post-menopause period) thereby reducing metabolic fitness. Our approaches to
define the molecular basis of this VMHvl activity node are highly innovative and likely to provide novel

10809711,"Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a significant public health problem, affecting nearly 40 million Americans.
We have made the exciting discovery that NIHL may be linked to the unfolded protein response (UPR), a
critical early response mechanism to cellular stress that has downstream effectors that can promote both cell
survival and apoptosis. In support of this, we have additionally identified and characterized a novel deafness
gene in mice, Tmtc4, which has also been recently identified as a potential deafness gene in a human family.
Mice in which Tmtc4 is genetically absent (Tmtc4 knockout (KO) mice) hear normally at the onset of hearing
but rapidly become deaf within 2 weeks and have markedly increased susceptibility to NIHL. We have found
that Tmtc4 is broadly expressed in cochlear hair cells and supporting cells, both of which degenerate over time
in Tmtc4 KO mice. We have shown that Tmtc4 is part of a macromolecular complex involved in clearing
calcium (Ca2+) from the cytoplasm into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and that cochlear cells from Tmtc4 KO
mice have impairments in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and dynamics. This impairment in Ca2+ management
leads to upregulation of the UPR and cell death in the Tmtc4 KO cochlea. In parallel with this genetic deafness
model of UPR dysregulation, we have found that NIHL in wild-type (WT) mice results in UPR upregulation
within 2 hours of noise exposure; this hearing loss could be prevented in part by treatment with one drug,
ISRIB, that specifically targets the UPR, or a second drug, CDN1163, that facilitates Ca2+ reuptake into the ER.
These preliminary findings strongly implicate the UPR as an early mediator of cellular stress in the cochlea,
upstream of other previously studied apoptotic mechanisms, and thus is a potential therapeutic target for a
wide range of acquired and genetic forms of hearing loss.
 In this proposal, our specific aims are to investigate 1) how, in cell lines, TMTC4 dysfunction, including
human variants associated with hearing loss, affect ER Ca2+ flux and, subsequently, UPR activation; 2) how, in
the cochlea, noise-induced trauma in the form of hair-cell tip-link disruption and ER Ca2+ depletion activate the
UPR to induce hair-cell loss; and 3) how, in in vivo models of hearing loss, the UPR is modulated to give rise to
different patterns of hearing loss and hair-cell death. These Aims will be achieved using a multidisciplinary set
of physiologic, biochemical, pharmacologic, and genetic techniques including ER Ca2+ imaging, mRNA
transcriptional analysis, and genetic TMTC4 conditional knockout mice. Through these experiments, we will
gain valuable insight into the mechanisms by which ER Ca2+ flux and the UPR are involved in genetic and
noise-induced hearing loss, laying the foundation for development of targeted therapies for NIHL, a critical
unmet clinical need."

Fifteen states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana products for non-medical use, making them
accessible to one-third of the US population. Despite having therapeutic effects, marijuana use leads to a wide
range of adverse physical and mental effects. Based on approaches to regulate alcohol and cigarettes, imposing
excise taxes on retail marijuana is among the most effective policies to mitigate related harmful public health
consequences. However, the retail marijuana market is still in its infancy, and state and local authorities have
knowledge gaps on how to best design excise tax structures (i.e., rates and bases) to reduce harms. Unlike
cigarette and alcohol markets where standard products dominate, marijuana products come in different forms
and various tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) levels, which consequently pose different levels of harm. Therefore,
there are multiple factors to consider when setting tax structures for retail marijuana. Taxes could be based on
weight, price, or potency. A weight basis has the advantage of raising prices equally to prevent switching to
lower-priced products but may fail to reduce THC consumption by not targeting potency. Conversely, because
more potent THC products are priced higher, price and potency bases may have the advantage of imposing
higher taxes on products with higher THC levels but may fail to put effective price barriers on less potent, lower-
priced products that would deter initiation. Further, marijuana prices decrease over time after legalization, calling
for frequent increases in tax rates to sufficiently raise prices. It is unclear whether existing tax rates are set
properly in response to this decreasing price trend. As such, which tax rates are applied to which bases will
significantly alter prices and relative prices by product form and potency level, thereby influencing marijuana use
and health outcomes. The tax structure design for retail marijuana is further challenged by the illegal market,
which is often used as an argument against raising marijuana excise taxes. We lack empirical evidence indicating
the extent to which excise tax structures drive consumers to the illegal market and how this may undermine the
effectiveness of tax policies in reducing marijuana use and harms. Project goal: To evaluate how excise tax
structures impact marijuana consumption and product choices among different marijuana forms and between
legal and illegal products. This project will innovatively integrate state-of-the-art choice experiments and natural
experiments to identify the impacts of tax structures on THC consumption and product choices. Aim 1: Examine
the impact of excise tax rates for retail marijuana on marijuana use and product choices. Aim 2: Examine the
impact of tax bases (weight, price, potency) on marijuana initiation and consumption. Aim 3: Evaluate the overall
THC consumption and market share shifts from legal to illegal markets under different excise tax structures for
retail marijuana using calibration. Results will have critical policy implications that inform how to set tax structure
to mitigate harms for states contemplating excise taxation policies as they legalize, and states and localities with
legal sales contemplating reforms to their current tax structures."

Chlamydia trachomatis (C.t.) is the leading cause of non-congenital blindness and the most prevalent sexually
transmitted bacterial infection in the world and thus, has a major impact on global health. C.t. replicates in a
membrane-bound vacuole, termed the inclusion, that is extensively modified early in infection through the
incorporation of over 50 type III secreted effector proteins termed inclusion membrane proteins (Incs). From
within the confines of the inclusion, the bacterium must engage select host organelles to obtain key nutrients
such as lipids and iron for bacterial replication and inclusion expansion. Despite the importance of nutrient
acquisition to chlamydial infection, a major gap in our knowledge exists regarding how C.t. acquires these
essential substrates from the host cell. Recent work from our group shows that the Inc protein CT229 binds and
recruits Rab GTPases and specific Rab effectors to the inclusion. Using cutting-edge genetics, we showed that
the absence of CT229 results in defects in intracellular replication and inclusion development. We hypothesize
that CT229-Rab interactions direct post-Golgi vesicles and recycling endosomes to the inclusion for the
acquisition of essential substrates needed for proliferation and inclusion expansion. In Aim 1, we will determine
how CT229-Rab interactions promote lipid acquisition by hijacking host vesicular trafficking pathways and iron
acquisition by promoting the recruitment of transferrin-positive vesicles to the inclusion. We will evaluate the lipid
composition of the bacterial and inclusion membranes and evaluate the importance of lipid acquisition for
incorporation into the inclusion and bacterial membranes. We will also answer a major long-standing question in
the field by determining whether transferrin indeed serves as a major source of iron for chlamydia and
furthermore mechanistically probe the mechanisms by which chlamydia may extract iron from this pathway. It is
unlikely that CT229 alone controls vesicle hijacking from start to finish, therefore in Aim 2 we will identify the
complex of host and bacterial proteins that are formed at the inclusion during CT229-Rab interactions. Using
cellular, genetic, and molecular techniques we will evaluate the impact of Inc-Inc interactions on Rab-dependent
vesicle transport to the inclusion. Detailed characterization of the bacterial and host proteins that co-opt host
vesicular trafficking during C.t. infection will provide a holistic view of how intracellular pathogens coordinate the
capture and fusion of host vesicles that are necessary for bacterial infection."

Protein quality control is vital for cellular function, encompassing pathways that help proteins fold and maintain structural
conformations, as well as cellular systems that ultimately degrade proteins. Several degenerative diseases, including those
that are accompanied by abnormal aging, are associated with altered protein quality control, highlighting the importance
of protein fidelity in both health and disease. CHIP (carboxyl terminus of heat shock 70-interacting protein) is a multi-
functional enzyme with distinct activities that contribute both to protein folding and protein degradation. Our lab recently
identified the first human disease associated with CHIP mutations, with phenotypes that include accelerated aging,
cerebellar ataxia and degeneration, cognitive dysfunction, and hypogonadism. Two known CHIP substrates, receptor-
interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) and AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), are regulated by either the degradative or re-
folding activities of CHIP, respectively. These kinases regulate important cellular processes, necroptosis (an inflammatory
form of programmed cell death) and cellular metabolism, both of which are central to the ability of cells to react to the
stress that occurs with aging or in pathophysiological conditions. In this proposal, we seek to define the role of protein
quality control in aging by determining how the various activities of CHIP regulate these recently identified
substrates, and the mechanism that drives the sensitivity to cell stress when CHIP function is compromised. Our
approach includes novel pre-clinical models of accelerated aging, cutting-edge cell models, and determining the molecular
movements of CHIP when engaged with its substrate. We then ask how disease-causing mutations in CHIP
mechanistically drive the molecular and cellular phenotypes associated with CHIP dysfunction. Finally, we will use our
preclinical models to determine how aging and disease pathologies are altered when necroptosis is inhibited
pharmacologically, or when CHIP function is restored genetically. The ultimate goal of these studies is to identify
druggable targets of CHIP-regulated signaling pathways that impact age-dependent progression of degenerative

This project will develop and apply new intravital microscopy techniques to gain greater insight into the putative
benefits effects of gamma entrainment, a promising nonpharmacological neuromodulation technique for
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other brain pathologies. Investigators recently demonstrated the powerful effects
of neuromodulation strategies for preserving synchronized neuronal activity in circuit pathways between the
visual cortex, hippocampus, and pre-frontal cortex. Gamma entrainment using sensory stimulus (GENUS) is a
simple, noninvasive gamma entrainment technique involving repeated exposure to a 40 Hz visual or auditory
stimulus. This method is easily translatable, and remarkably, experiments in preclinical animal models show that
it effectively reduces Amyloid levels and synaptic degradation while evoking morphological changes and cytokine
secretion from microglia. In some human patients, the technique has shown promise for reducing cognitive
decline. Ostensibly, the stimulus parameters require optimization to improve its efficacy in AD patients. The goal
of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of how GENUS influences cerebral energy metabolism and
microvascular hemodynamics. Advanced microscopy methods will be developed and applied to mouse models
of AD to nondisruptively characterize GENUS-related changes to cellular signaling, metabolism, and
microvascular blood flow in the living brain with cellular resolution. By developing new microscopy techniques,
we will explore how these indicators of metabolism and cerebral blood flow change in different regions of the
brain in response to GENUS neuromodulation. The project’s findings will improve our understanding of the
technique’s operating mechanisms. By understanding how GENUS affects measurable changes of brain
hemodynamics, the results will eventually guide strategies to optimize its utility in human patients. Ultimately,
the project’s findings will facilitate development of accessible, nonpharmacological methods to stem AD’s
dramatically increasing global prevalence."
10810798,"Nearly 25% of Americans die in intensive care units (ICUs), the largest proportion of whom are older persons
with advanced illness. Most deaths in ICUs are expected and involve the removal of ventilator support, or
palliative ventilator withdrawal (PVW). Prior work by the Principal Investigator (PI) found more than two-thirds
of ICU patients undergoing PVW were over age 60. Moreover, there are unique management considerations
when transitioning an older ICU patient to comfort care, including for the PVW process (e.g. choice and dose of
drugs to alleviate distressing symptoms and approach to agitated delirium). While research conducted over the
past 15 years has informed several aspects of palliative care in the ICU, relatively little of that work has
focused on PVW. As such, PVW practices vary widely, and patient suffering is common; 30-59% of terminally
extubated patients experience dyspnea. Thus, experts and national organizations have called for evidence to
inform guidelines for PVW, an area of particular relevance to older patients. The over-riding objective of the
proposed research is to generate the evidence-base to improve PVW in older ICU patients. The Specific Aims
are: 1. To better understand the patient experience and providers’ perspectives, 150 mechanically ventilated
ICU patients over 60 years old will be recruited and prospectively followed in two Boston hospitals (180 beds)
undergoing PVW. 2. To develop and refine a Comfort Measures Only Time out (CMOT) intervention consisting
of a structured time out with check-list protocol for the ICU team (nurse, physician, respiratory therapist) to
improve the process of PVW. 3. To pilot test the CMOT intervention in 4 ICUs (2 medical/2 surgical) among 40
PVW patients. Impact: By rigorously characterizing the experience of older ICU patients undergoing PVW, and
developing and pilot testing a novel CMOT intervention, the proposed work will generate the much need
evidence base to improve the care provided to this vulnerable population. Findings will directly inform the
design of a larger RCT (R01) to fully evaluate the intervention. This work will establish the PI as an
independent investigator with unique skills conducting palliative care intervention research among older adults

10810708,"Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal disease which has a median survival of 3.5 years and affects
approximately 89,000 people in the United States. There is no known genetic cause of IPF, and thus
identification of new mechanisms required for disease pathogenesis is of critical importance for the
development of novel treatment strategies. A defining feature of IPF is the differentiation of lung fibroblasts into
myofibroblasts, which secrete excessive amounts of extracellular matrix (collagen) and are the primary cell
responsible for the structural remodeling and impairment of lung function characteristic of IPF. We have
recently discovered that myofibroblasts depend on metabolic reprogramming characterized by increased levels
of glycolysis and metabolite flux through the de novo serine, glycine, one-carbon (SGOC) pathway to promote
glycine production for collagen protein synthesis. Glycine constitutes one third of all amino acids in collagen
protein and de novo synthesis of glycine from glucose is required to support collagen protein synthesis by
myofibroblasts. However, the signaling and transcriptional regulators of this metabolic reprogramming in
fibroblasts are unknown. The central goal of this proposal is to identify the regulators of metabolic
reprogramming in myofibroblasts and to determine their role in lung fibrosis. The premise underlying this goal
is that elucidating the mechanisms of metabolic regulation in myofibroblasts will unveil new strategies to fulfill
the sorely unmet therapeutic need in IPF. Our preliminary results show that TGF-β (Transforming Growth
Factor-β, the key cytokine involved in fibrosis), promotes signaling through the mTOR pathway, which
activates ATF4 (activating transcription factor 4). ATF4 is required for the expression of SGOC pathway
enzymes in myofibroblasts. We further show that SGOC pathway activation not only promotes collagen protein
production by myofibroblasts, but alters the epigenome of these cells, possibly providing additional ways to
target myofibroblast biology for therapeutic purposes. In the current proposal, we aim to determine the
regulators of myofibroblast metabolism and determine the mechanisms by which altered metabolism
contributes to the myofibroblastic phenotype. In Specific Aim 1 we will determine how the transcription factor
ATF4 regulates the SGOC and other metabolic pathways in lung fibroblasts in vitro and in vivo. In Specific Aim
2, we will determine how the mTOR signaling pathway regulates ATF4 and other transcriptional regulators of
cellular metabolism in lung fibroblasts in vitro and in vivo. In Specific Aim 3, we will determine how SGOC
pathway activation contributes to epigenetic changes in lung fibroblasts in vitro and in vivo. Our proposed
experiments will identify and fully characterize multiple targetable pathways required for fibrogenesis."

 Bacillus anthracis is a Gram-positive soil bacterium that forms spores when starved for nutrients and
contact with these spores causes anthrax in animals and humans. B. anthracis spores are surrounded by
three protective layers, the outermost of which is a loosely fitting exosporium. The exosporium plays key roles
in spore survival and disease progression. Over the past two decades, there has been significant progress in
identifying the proteins that comprise the exosporium and their functions, however, the assembly process is
poorly understood. This proposal is designed to elucidate major components of exosporium assembly.
 The exosporium is a bipartite structure consisting of a paracrystalline basal layer and an external hair-
like nap. Each filament of the nap is formed solely by a trimer of the collagen-like glycoprotein BclA. In
contrast, the basal layer contains ~25 different proteins. One of these proteins called BxpB is required for the
attachment of nearly all BclA in the exosporium. BclA attachment occurs through and requires only its 38-
residue amino-terminal domain (NTD), which is proteolytically processed during sporulation to remove residues
1-19. Cryo-electron micrographs reveal that each filament of the nap—through BclA residues 20-38—is
attached to a basal layer surface protrusion that appears to be a trimer of BxpB.
 When extracted from spores, BclA and BxpB are present primarily in >250-kDa complexes, the stability
of which suggested that the two proteins are attached through a covalent bond. Recent studies from this lab
have demonstrated that complexes between purified BxpB and BclA residues 20-38, that are as stable as
BclA-BxpB complexes found in spores, can be formed in vitro. These complexes do not contain covalently
cross-linked peptides, indicating that BclA-BxpB attachment is noncovalent. Furthermore, we recently
determined the crystal structure of BxpB trimers, with monomers that are all b-strand with connecting loops.
The orientation of three of these loops suggest that they can interact with and entrap the BclA NTD.
 The primary goal of this study is to use structural and genetic methods to describe the amino acid
contacts that account for the stable BclA-BxpB attachment. Structural tools include X-ray crystallography,
focusing on a BclA NTD-BxpB complex, and hydrogen deuterium exchange by mass spectrometry to reveal
contacts between the BclA NTD and BxpB in solution. Targeted mutagenesis of BxpB and the BclA NTD will
reveal specific roles for individual amino acids in the attachment process. Related studies will examine the
mechanism of BxpB attachment to and stabilization of the basal layer scaffold and the requirement for BclA
NTD cleavage in BclA-BxpB complex formation. The expected outcome is a detailed model for BclA-BxpB
attachment and insertion into the exosporium. This study will further impact the field as this model is likely to
be shared by many other spore-forming bacteria, including important Bacillus and Clostridium pathogens."

Descriptive Title: REpeated ASSEssment of SurvivorS in ICH-MRI, an ancillary neuroimaging study of the
REASSESS ICH longitudinal study.
Purpose: The REpeated ASSEssment of SurvivorS MRI study will conduct a single MRI with SWI/GRE along
with blinded central measurement of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) parameters to determine if
evacuation of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) reduces risk of later progression of CSVD. This
study builds on the funded REASSESS ICH parent study which is conducting serial long-term cognitive and
functional assessments on the same population to determine if ICH evacuation reduces risk of cognitive
decline in the ageing brain. This study will compare CSVD burden after minimally invasive surgery (MIS) as
performed in the MISTIE III and ENRICH trials, and standard of care, supplemented by comparative data from
The ROSE-Longitudinal Assessment With Neuroimaging (ROSE-LAWN) study (R-01-NS120493) which is
conducting MRI on 250 cases recruited into the ROSE study of ICH at 12-24 months with cognitive exams.
Rationale: ICH survivors are at high risk for progressive cognitive impairment which is strongly associated with
greater hematoma volume, but also with cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and with multiple markers for CSVD, the
most common cause of vascular dementia. MIS with effective hematoma volume reduction may improve long-
term functional outcomes while also reducing mortality. As such, reducing hematoma volume after ICH may
reduce the progression of CSVD as a mechanism for reducing the risk of post ICH cognitive decline.
Design: REASSESS MRI is an MRI study ancillary to the ongoing REASSESS study. MRI will be performed
during a one-time in-person visit of an anticipated 150-200 ICH survivors enrolled in MISTIE III or ENRICH.
Aim 1: To determine the effects of surgical clot reduction on MRI markers of cerebral small vessel
disease (CSVD) after ICH. We hypothesize that reducing end of treatment (EOT) ICH volume will be
associated with decrease in total burden of CSVD (including WMHs, microbleeds or siderosis, perivascular
spaces, lacunar infarcts and atrophy) in survivors of MISTIE III and ENRICH.
Exploratory Aim 1: To determine the effects of burden of CSVD on MRI on cognitive function after
surgical clot reduction for ICH. We hypothesize that the burden of total CSVD, and other MRI features of
CSVD will correlate with cognitive decline measured by the Folstein Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE) and will
be modified by EOT ICH volume in operated and non-operated survivors of MISTIE III and ENRICH.
Exploratory Aim 2: To determine the effects of inflammatory gene pathway expression on CSVD MRI
markers. We will evaluate whether inflammatory pathways, in particular, differ between those with and without
burden of CSVD on MRI independent of gene risk scores for dementia and surgery."

students from biomedically-relevant majors involved in research programs as undergraduates, 2) Encourage
URM students to enter graduate research degree programs, and 3) Recruit and prepare U-RISE scholars for
graduate school and research careers through an integrated mentoring and training program that will enhance
academic and research skills. Key measurable outcomes include that 100% of U-RISE scholars will graduate
within two years of joining U-RISE and at least 80% of our scholars will matriculate into doctoral programs
(PhD or MD/PhD) within 3 years of graduation.
Thirty scholars will be recruited over five years from the Departments of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,
Biology, Chemistry & Chemical Biology, Mathematics & Statistics, Physics, Psychology and the School of
Engineering at the end of their sophomore years. Criteria for scholar selection will include, but are not limited to
GPA (typically > 3.2), underrepresented status, and a desire to pursue a career in biomedical research. Other
factors that would suggest that a student would excel in the program, graduate school and beyond, will also be
considered. Students will participate in authentic research experiences with one of our 26 mentors from across
the UNM campus. Required and elective courses will strengthen writing and quantitative/computational skills
and provide training in methods to enhance data rigor and reproducibility, and responsible conduct in research.
Professional development training and mentoring will contribute to scholar success. At the same time, the U-
RISE at UNM program will improve undergraduate experiences overall through improvements in advising,
curriculum, and dissemination of information about opportunities for undergraduate research and graduate
school. Evaluation of the U-RISE scholars, mentors, and pack leaders will be performed each year and student

Yogic breathwork is a low-risk low-cost mind-body therapy that can be easily learned and performed without any additional equipment. The practices of yogic breathwork have been demonstrated to be effective for a wide range of health conditions including sleep and neurological conditions. While underlying mechanisms are still not fully known, one previously studied mechanism for the health benefits of yogic breathwork is through parasympathetic activation as evidenced by decreased respiration rate, heart rate and blood pressure, and increased heart rate variability. Another mechanism for explaining the health benefits of yogic breathwork can be its direct influence on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation, which to date has not been investigated due to lack of non-invasive methodology. CSF circulates by bulk flow (macrocirculation) around the central nervous system (CNS) while ensuring the health of the CNS. CSF undergoes periodic pulsations due to arterial pulsation and respiration. While cardiac-driven CSF has been studied extensively, respiratory-driven CSF is not very well-understood due to lack of real-time non-invasive approaches. To address this gap, we have recently developed a real-time phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (RT-PCMRI) technique, and demonstrated that deep slow abdominal breathing - compared to natural breathing - increases the amplitude of the CSF flow velocities while lowering the frequency of respiratory-driven CSF flow, suggesting that breathing patterns have quasi-immediate influence on the modulation of CSF circulation. Additionally, CSF circulation plays a central role in maintaining glymphatic function (microcirculation), which is a recently identified brain-wide cleaning mechanism that supports the rapid interchange of CSF and interstitial fluid (ISF), and facilitates the clearance of solutes and metabolic wastes from the brain interstitium, preferentially during sleep compared to wakefulness. In order to evaluate glymphatic function in human brain, we have recently developed a novel non-invasive imaging approach incorporating simultaneous polysomnography and magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements across sleep-wakes cycles, which indicated enhanced glymphatic activity during sleep, particularly in slow wave sleep. Because we know that the entry of CSF along perivascular channels facilitates glymphatic function in rodents, we hypothesize that the influence of yogic breathwork on CSF flow dynamics will also facilitate the glymphatic activity. Because we know yoga improves sleep, and glymphatic function is mainly active during sleep compared to the wakefulness, we expect that a regular practice of yogic breathwork will improve sleep quality, and will benefit the glymphatic activity. Thus, we propose to: (1) determine the influence of an 8-week yogic breathwork intervention on CSF flow dynamics; (2) determine the influence of an 8-week yogic breathwork intervention on CSF circulation (flow dynamics and glymphatic function), and; (3) measure the effects of the breathwork intervention on participants’ long-term sleep patterns, and correlate the degree of sleep improvement with the changes in CSF circulation measured in Aim 2."

Cytotoxic lymphocytes, including Natural Killer (NK) cells, are at the forefront of a therapeutic revolution in which
the power of the cytotoxic cell is harnessed to kill tumor or virus-infected cells in patients with otherwise hopeless
medical diagnoses. For nearly two decades, our laboratory has studied NK cell biology, learning that NK cells
use a tightly controlled series of cell biological steps to precisely target their potent cytotoxic contents onto a
diseased cell. This process is initiated and directed through the lytic immunological synapse, a specialized
interface formed between the NK cell and its triggering target. In previous programs, we have shown that
positioning of the NK cell’s destructive organelle, the lytic granule, is key to precise control of NK cell killing.
When NK cells meet a target cell, lytic granules rapidly converge to the microtubule organizing center (MTOC);
as activation proceeds, the MTOC and its granules move to the lytic synapse where they traverse through a
dynamic actin meshwork to be secreted onto the target cell (degranulation). Lytic granule convergence is dynein-
dependent and key to limiting killing to a single target cell. When convergence is disrupted, NK cells degranulate
in all directions, killing “innocent” bystander cells. While convergence makes sense for surveillance cells who
seek to destroy a single infected or malignant cell without causing damage to surrounding healthy tissue, it is
limiting in the context of immunotherapy for an established tumor. We propose that blocking convergence without
interfering with degranulation will convert NK cells into efficient non-directional destroyers, better suited for solid
tumor cancer therapy. We predict that inhibitors and mutations that durably promote non-directional
degranulation will promote killing efficiency and afford broader killing (escaping cells, stroma, and tumor-
promoting immune cells) in complex pathogenic environments. In the proposed work, we test known and novel
inhibitors of convergence, using high through-put small molecule inhibitor and genetic screens as well as a
physical “synapsome mapping” approach to identify novel candidates. We ask whether we can achieve non-
directional degranulation in a sustainable way (Aim 1A) without disrupting other critical NK cell functions (Aim
1B). In Aim 2, we confirm relevance of non-directional degranulation in a new, tumor-relevant, high-resolution,
3-dimensional model system we’ve called TheCOS (Thermal Collapse of Stroma). This hydrogel-based system
allows us to generate instantaneous cell interactions in a manipulable complex environment suitable for high
resolution live-cell imaging and functional assessment. We expect our insights to inform an immunotherapy
strategy wherein a cytotoxic cell could be maximally efficient, destroying cells it normally wouldn’t, and potentially
even avoiding exhaustion within the tumor environment. This would be of tremendous therapeutic value as
broadly targeting the pathogenic environment with present cell-based immunotherapies has been a challenge.
Equally important, the detailed “map” of synaptic function and novel tools we develop herein will provide critical
resources for comprehending and harnessing the function of these powerful cytotoxic cells."

We will elucidate how three RNA editing Catalytic Complexes (CCs) interact with Substrate Complexes (SCs),
Accessory Factors (AFs), mRNAs and gRNAs to generate translatable mitochondrial mRNAs via precise U
insertion and deletion and do so differentially between bloodstream (BF) and procyclic (PF) forms in
Trypanosoma brucei. We hypothesize that this occurs via specific molecular interactions between domains of
CC, SC and AF proteins and the mRNA/gRNA substrate. We will in: Aim 1. Identify these interactions in PFs
and determine which are RNA dependent by a combination of in vivo proximity labelling, protein-protein cross-
linking, and affinity purification methods. We will build structural models to identify similarities and differences
between the three CCs. Aim 2. Determine the effects of loss of function (LOF) mutations of editing steps on
these interactions, interactions with RNA by cross-linking immunoprecipitation and on RNA editing by RT-PCR
sequencing. We will prioritize mutations that affect initiation of editing, subsequent catalytic steps and the
functions of other essential proteins that are in all three CCs. This will validate and extend results from Aim 1,
link the interactions to functional steps of editing and advance the structural models. Aim 3. Identify physical and
functional interactions in BF cells by approaches used in Aims 1 and 2 and extended using a MGA knock-in
approach which eliminates dependence on RNA editing in BFs and enables additional analyses of LOF
mutations and interactions with RNA. This aim will identify similar and different molecular interactions between
BFs and PFs. Aim 4. Determine the detailed characteristics of protein domains that function differently between
BFs and PFs. We will determine the detailed chemical, structural, and functional characteristics of CC protein
domains that affect editing differently in BFs vs. PFs using a focused saturation mutagenesis approach.
Overall, this project will advance the understanding of how multiprotein complexes generate translatable mRNAs
for essential components of the mt energy generating system in protozoan pathogens and do so differently
between their developmental stages. The results may aid identification of targets for novel drug targets that are
needed and provide insights into mechanisms of protein/nucleic acid interactions that are widespread and
important in eukaryotes and which may lead to practical applications."

avoidance) without consideration of other potentially important processes such as emotional arousal, the
quality of emotions expressed, and sequences and trajectories of communication behaviors. This narrow focus
has prohibited advancements in our understanding of communication processes which, in turn, limits efforts to
develop efficacious interventions and target them to couples most at risk of poor adjustment. The proposed
study will address these limitations by leveraging a large longitudinal, multi-method dataset we collected
among 353 couples coping with stage II-IV breast, colon, rectal, and lung cancer (R01 CA201179). Participants
completed global self-report measures of communication four times over a one-year period; twice-daily
ecological momentary assessments (EMA) over two weeks; and audio- and video-recorded couple
conversations of cancer-related topics from which we coded affective expressions and communicative
behaviors and obtained data on fundamental frequency, a novel objective indicator of vocally expressed
emotional arousal. Preliminary results provided support for two theories of couple communication in cancer
(Social Cognitive Processing and Relationship Intimacy) and underscored the utility of different indicators of
communication in predicting adjustment. While these findings are promising, our original aims and methods
relied on single indicators of communication in isolation, and thus did not fully capitalize on the integrative
potential of the dataset. Recent advances in relationship science suggest that the integration of self-report,
behavioral, and fundamental frequency data can provide a richer and more sophisticated picture of
communication processes and their impacts on intra- and interpersonal outcomes. This in turn can inform the
development of more targeted and efficacious interventions. Specific aims of this proposal are: (1) To identify
communication profiles of couples based on EMA and observational data. (2) To examine the predictive
relationship of these communication profiles to outcomes including patient and partner psychological
adjustment, relational functioning, and physical and functional well-being collected at the 12-month follow up.
(3a) To develop, using machine learning, a brief self-report screening tool that will identify couples most at risk
for poor outcomes based on the communication profiles developed and tested in Aims 1-2. (3b) To
concurrently and prospectively validate this brief screening tool in a new sample of 270 couples (patients with
stage II-IV breast, colorectal, or lung cancer and their partners). (3c) To identify facilitators and barriers to
implementation of the screener in a clinical setting. The goal is development of an efficient, empirically-derived
measure that can be administered to patients and partners in real-world clinical settings."
10804657,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Precise and dynamic regulation of vascular barrier function, the ability of endothelial cells that line blood vessels
to provide a selectively permeable barrier between the bloodstream and surrounding tissue, is universally
important for maintaining tissue homeostasis. The pathological consequences of dysregulated barrier are evident
in various cardiovascular diseases like atherosclerosis and chronic ischemia as well as inflammatory and
neurodegenerative diseases. In homeostatic conditions, hemodynamic shear stress, the frictional drag force
exerted by the flow of blood on endothelial cells, promotes vascular homeostasis and barrier function through
remodeling and enhancement of cell-cell adherens junctions (AJs) and intrinsic actin cytoskeletal dynamics. The
critical cell-cell adhesion molecule vascular endothelial (VE-) cadherin, the principle component of AJs, regulates
junctional stability through its turnover and internalization and experiences significant changes in tension under
shear stress. Additionally, the actin cytoskeleton regulates vascular barrier by maintaining a balance between
dynamic pushing forces to maintain VE-cadherin and tensile forces which stabilize intracellular AJ complexes.
However, the specific molecular sensors and transducers that link hemodynamic shear stress to the mechanical
regulation of AJs and vascular barrier function remain poorly understood. Activation of the ubiquitously important
Notch1 receptor was recently been found to modulate vascular barrier function in response to shear stress by
complexing with VE-cadherin and stabilizing AJs. While previous work has determined how this Notch1 cortical
pathway modulates vascular barrier function, it remains unclear how shear stress activates the Notch1 receptor.
Building on preliminary data linking Notch1 to intrinsic cellular adhesive and cytoskeletal machinery, this proposal
tests the hypothesis that intrinsic coupling of Notch1 to VE-cadherin and the cortical actin cytoskeleton regulates
shear stress-mediated Notch1 activation. Interrogation of Notch1 activation in response to shear stress will be
approached by completing two specific aims: (1) determine how VE-cadherin spatiotemporally regulates
Notch1 and its ligand Dll4 to coordinate activation by shear stress and (2) identify the mechanical
interplay between Notch1 and intrinsic actin cytoskeletal dynamics under shear stress. Throughout the
course of the proposed research, I will gain training in 3D biomimetic models of the human microvasculature,
super-resolution live cell microscopy, and mechanistic molecular approaches, while simultaneously enhancing
career development through training in scientific communication, mentoring, and teaching. I have assembled an
exceptional, complementary mentoring team to help me achieve my research and career goals: Dr. Matthew
Kutys, an expert in organotypic tissue modeling and cell mechanics will be my primary sponsor and Dr. Diane
Barber, a leader in cellular cytoskeletal dynamics, will be my co-sponsor. Ultimately, these findings will identify
new mechanisms by which Notch1 is activated in response to shear stress and potentially identify new
therapeutic targets for modulating barrier function and other vasculopathies where Notch1 is implicated."
10804661,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pregnant persons are at increased risk for severe COVD-19 illness compared to non-pregnant
women of reproductive age, experiencing higher rates of admission to intensive care,
mechanical ventilation and death. In addition to the direct impacts on the health of pregnant
persons, there is growing evidence to suggest COVID-19 adversely impacts fetal and neonatal
health. As of May 2021, three vaccines have been issued Emergency Use Approval in the US.
However, because pregnant persons were excluded from initial Phase 3 clinical trials, data to
confirm the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy are lacking.
Driven by this limited data, obstetric and public health governing bodies do not currently directly
recommend vaccination for pregnant persons. The American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advise that
COVID-19 vaccines should not be withheld from pregnant persons. As a result, the decision to
vaccinate is made at the individual level, and pregnant persons express anxiety around making
this decision. Additional data to inform the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines
administered during pregnancy would strengthen current clinical guidelines.
Despite weak guidance, individuals are choosing to be vaccinated during pregnancy. As of 3
May 2021, 106,241 pregnant persons were reported as having received a COVID-19 vaccine
through V-SAFE, the CDC’s active vaccine safety surveillance system. When surveyed, more
than 50% of pregnant persons report an intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Phase 2/3
clinical trial data are currently being gathered to evaluate safety and efficacy. While these
clinical trial data are being collected, we have the opportunity to learn from large observational
studies of pregnant persons who have chosen to be vaccinated.
Leveraging existing national medical claims and electronic medical records for more than
870,000 pregnancies, we plan to conduct large-scale post-implementation cohort studies to
evaluate the uptake, safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines administered during
pregnancy. Completion of the proposed research will provide important epidemiological
evidence on the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy. This
evidence will aid informed decision and policy-making around COVID-19 vaccination for
pregnant persons."
10930900,"Sub-Saharan Africa is most severely affected by the HIV epidemic, particularly Zambia. Young people with
HIV (YPWH) are disproportionately impacted by HIV/AIDS. Emerging adulthood (ages 18-24) is characterized
by increasing independence, risk-taking behaviors, identity exploration, and changing social supports, which
may impact HIV management behaviors, including medication adherence, retention in care, sexual risk
behavior, and substance abuse. Substance use has synergistic and additive effects on health and HIV-related
comorbidities, and accelerated HIV disease. Self-management interventions targeting HIV and substance use
reduction in Zambian YPWH are urgently needed. We propose to develop and pilot a multi-component,
mHealth intervention to promote HIV self-management and reduce substance use. We will adapt the 4-
session, in-person Healthy Choices (HC) intervention for mHealth (mHC) to increase access and delivery of
HC. In addition, we will develop and pilot test Motivational Text Messaging (MTM) to enhance the impact of
mHC. mHC and MTM will be delivered using Computerized Intervention Authoring System (CIAS). Our
primary aim is to develop and assess the preliminary efficacy of the resulting mHealth intervention. We will
utilize a Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) framework to identify the most effective intervention
component or combination of components that addresses self-management and substance use among YPWH
in Zambia. The proposed study includes 3 phases. Phase I includes focus groups with Zambian YPWH to
explore barriers and facilitators of HIV self-management and substance use to inform the intervention. Phase
II consists of adapting and beta testing of mHC and MTM for functionality and feasibility using a community
advisory board of Zambian YPWH, local healthcare personnel, and community leaders. In Phase III, we will
conduct a pilot using the MOST framework to assess feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of
intervention components (mHC and MTM) to improve HIV self-management and reduce alcohol and other
drug use. One hundred YPWH be randomized to four experimental conditions: 1) Standard ART Counseling
(SAC), 2) mHC + SAC, 3) MTM + SAC, and 4) mHC + MTM + SAC. Feasibility and acceptability of the
intervention will be assessed through paradata of usage patterns and the System Usability Scale. Preliminary
impact will be assessed by evaluating ART Adherence and substance use. YPWH will complete assessments at
baseline and 3-, and 6-months post-intervention. Biomarkers of adherence to ART and HIV/STI will be
collected. Upon project completion, we will have an optimized mHealth intervention to support YPWH’s self-
management of HIV which will be ready for testing in a larger efficacy trial."
10813518,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pangenome references and indexes have been shown to alleviate the reference bias problem. Computer
scientists recently described the novel “move structure,” which supports similar pattern-matching capabil-
ities as the more typical r-index or F M -index structures, but with radically improved locality of reference.
That is, move-structure algorithms access computer memory in a predictable way that minimizes cache
misses, or other kinds of pauses due to data movement. We will adapt the “move structure” to the problem
of pangenome indexing, enabling extremely and consistently fast pangenome queries. This will allow us
to leverage inclusive and bias-avoiding pangenomes in applications where (a) we must keep up with a
sequencer in real-time, e.g. nanopore sequencing, or (b) the index is so big that we must divide it across
many computers, e.g. BLAST-like sequence classiﬁcation."

10814839,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common genetic red blood cell disorder in the African American (AA)
population. Prior to 1970, only half of the children with SCD survived to adulthood. With universal newborn
screening and medical advances (antibiotic prophylaxis, transfusions, hydroxyurea, stem cell transplantation and
gene therapy), survival rates have improved. In patients with SCD, transition from pediatric to adult medical care
is a high-risk period for death. Preventing premature death requires that patients with SCD engage in self-care
as they transition into adulthood. However, cognitive impairment is a pervasive debilitating feature of SCD across
the lifespan, and influences ability to engage in effective decision-making needed for self-care. Additionally,
cognitive impairment is compounded by specific challenges faced by transition-aged youth with SCD due to
health-related disparities and poor social determinants of health. As such, there is an unmet need for patients
with SCD to adopt and assimilate decision-making skills to enhance self-care and self-advocacy, which could
result in improvement in transition of care and independence in adulthood, thus preventing life-threatening
complications and premature death. This study aims to utilize a cognitive remediation program (CRP) delivered
via telehealth to improve decision-making skills necessary for successful transition of care. Scientific Aim 1 will
determine if a 4-week CRP improves transition readiness skills in youth with SCD (10-18y). Persistence of
improvement across time will also be evaluated. Scientific Aim 2 will assess brain-related changes pre- to post-
CRP, in order to identify neurobiological markers related to cognitive changes in youth with SCD after
intervention. Additionally, two exploratory aims will be investigated in order to 1) identify demographic and clinical
characteristics associated with improvement in transition readiness skills post-CRP, and 2) to test the feasibility
and preliminary efficacy of a 1-year post-CRP booster session in order to continue to maintain transition
readiness skills. Overall, this study will promote my long-term career goal of improving quality of life for patients
with SCD and will provide opportunities for additional training and career development. The career development
plan includes formal training in research methodology specific to conducting clinical trials, engagement of
minority populations in research, and neuroimaging methodology and analyses. The scientific and training plans
are supported by a team of experienced mentors and advisors who are committed to the success of this project
and my development as a patient-oriented scientist. The primary mentor is an expert in neurocognitive outcomes
among blood disorders, an experienced mentor of young investigators, and the director of the UAB Institute for
Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship. The results of this proposal will be utilized to form the foundation of a future
clinical trial designed to test the refined CRP among those who are most likely to benefit from the intervention.
This project will strengthen my skills as a clinical researcher, establish an independent research platform, and
make a true contribution towards improving long-term health outcomes in patients with SCD."
10814860,"Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a major public health problem in the United States. Data from the
Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study afford our team an opportunity to significantly
advance the study of mTBI-associated behavioral, psychiatric, and neurocognitive problems which are
very controversial. We shall analyze biopsychosocial data generated since 2016 from this ten-year prospective
longitudinal 21-site national study of an enrolled cohort of over 11,000 nine/ten-year old children who have
been subsequently evaluated annually. The study design permits a rare analysis of predictive factors and
mechanisms of post-injury behavioral, psychiatric, and neurocognitive outcomes by examining child and
family variables collected pre-injury and post-injury in the 237 children who have so far suffered a mTBI in
the years subsequent to enrollment. The mTBI group will be compared with two groups of children 1) with a
post-enrollment accidental bone fracture (orthopedic injury; OI); and 2) a lifetime “no injury” (NI) group.
Additional children who have had a mTBI will be identified and will be compared with OI and NI controls in the
first month of the study, and at the end of year 2 and middle of year 4 of the five-year study.
 There are three unique aspects of the proposed study. 1) Pre-injury and post-injury sequential
structural and functional neuroimaging data facilitate predictive and mediation analyses of behavioral,
psychiatric, and neurocognitive outcomes using individual pre- versus post-injury changes and group
differences in brain maturation trajectories. 2) Genetic data permit predictive and moderation analyses of
outcomes using a novel systems biology approach not based on candidate genes. 3) The proposed study
evaluates multiple neurocognitive domains before and after mTBI.
 The study will examine 3 major hypotheses: (1) Change in behavioral measures and changes in
neurocognitive function will be of greater magnitude, and new-onset psychiatric disorders will occur at a
significantly higher rate, in children with mTBI compared with children with OI and NI. (2) Behavioral changes,
new-onset psychiatric disorders, and neurocognitive function changes in children will be predicted by pre-injury
child variables (sex, adaptive function, academic and cognitive function, lifetime psychiatric disorders,
behavioral ratings, brain structure and functional MRI measures, and genetic factors), and pre-injury family
variables (socioeconomic status, family function, family psychiatric history) in children with mTBI, OI, and NI.
(3) The occurrence and pattern of behavioral changes, new-onset psychiatric disorders, and neurocognitive
function changes will be mediated by child brain variables (trajectory of brain maturation), post-injury family
variables (functioning and stressors), and injury variables (age at injury, time-since-injury, severity, presence of
a brain lesion, and extent of diffuse axonal injury) and moderated by child gene structure (genetic factors), in
children with mTBI, OI, and NI."
10908729,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Changes in chromatin architecture is a hallmark of aging. Disruption of the nuclear lamina and associated
heterochromatin are commonly observed in various aging contexts, including premature aging diseases, cellular
senescence, and normative aging. Although these shared structural changes have been reported for over two
decades, their impact on transcription and the contribution to age-related degenerative changes remains
unknown. Through computational analysis, we recently identified that CpG islands (CGIs), mammalian
promoter-associated elements, provide important clues to answering this question. In humans, about 60% of
genes contain CGIs at their promoters (CGI+ genes) and are broadly expressed throughout the body, while the
other 40% of genes that do not have CGIs (CGI- genes) exhibit tissue-restricted expression patterns. Our
preliminary results demonstrate that, in young nuclei, only CGI- genes can reside within lamina-associated
heterochromatin, when transcriptionally inactive. This suggests that aging-mediated heterochromatin
decondensation and lamina disruption would specifically hinder the repressive status of CGI- genes. Our data
indeed show over 30% of CGI- genes are mis-activated within various aged tissues, and this pattern coincides
with the loss of organ function. In this project, we will test the novel hypothesis that 1) changes in chromatin
architecture during aging directly trigger uncontrolled expression of CGI- genes in tissues/contexts where they
should not be expressed and this, in turn, 2) accelerates age-associated deterioration. We will also test whether
the 3) pharmacological inhibition of CGI- gene misexpression delay age-related degenerative changes."

Restricted amounts of biological samples that can be collected from pediatric patients
for the study of immune function are often insufﬁcient for conventional assays.
Development of novel, multi-parameter sample sparing assays is necessary for
advancing the fundamental understanding of the immune system. In this proposal, we
outline three aims which detail the addition and integration of new biological readouts to
an existing microﬂuidic technology and the use of this expanded platform to investigate
the mechanisms for how allergies and asthma develop in children. The kit-on-a-lid-
assay (KOALA) is an easy to use self-contained microﬂuidic platform which is capable
of isolating neutrophils from whole blood, and assessing their chemotactic abilities. In
Aim 1 we propose to adapt and validate assays for measuring neutrophil ROS
production, NETosis, phagocytosis, cytokine production, and gene expression (RT-
qPCR) into KOALA. We also plan to modify the cell capture speciﬁcity of KOALA to
allow us to isolate T cells from whole blood and assess their cytokine production and
gene expression (RT-qPCR). The last component of Aim 1 is to test and compare a
new, less invasive blood draw method called Hemolink™ against traditional blood draw
methods in terms of immune cell phenotype. In Aim 2 we propose to use a single-cell
real-time non-invasive label-free microscopy method called optical metabolic imaging
(OMI) to identify single-cell heterogeneity in activation within T cell and neutrophil
populations. OMI is compatible with the other endpoints and can be run simultaneously.
In Aim 3 will apply our multiplexed KOALA assays to blood samples from a cohort of
children with allergic disease and matched healthy controls from the WISC cohort (an
ongoing study at UW that includes farm and non-farm children). We will compare our
neutrophil and T cell function and phenotype results from these children with the
extensive measurements being done as part of the WISC cohort study. In Aim 3 we will
also extend these analyses to a group of infants from the CREW study (a new study at
UW that aims to identify early life genetic and environmental risk factors for allergic
diseases and asthma) using the HemoLink™ device to draw blood with minimal
discomfort and proﬁle type 2 T cell function (T cells differentiated to secrete IL-4, IL-5,
IL-13 and other type 2 cytokines) using KOALA. If successful in our aims, we will have
created a miniaturized, highly multiplexed, self-contained microﬂuidic platform that is
capable of measuring biological markers related to immune status and function. This
system will have then been validated in pediatric subjects and ready for transition into
clinical research."
10816568,"PROJECT SUMMARY: 40% of U.S. adults are obese. Obesity produces type II diabetes, which increases the
risk for cardiovascular disease, many cancers, and Alzheimer's. The NIH strategic plan for obesity research
provides “a blueprint (to) encourage the research community to examine the epidemic of obesity from diverse
perspectives…in order to develop and evaluate new prevention and treatment strategies”. Further, the NIDDK
Cognitive and Clinical Neuroscience of Obesity Program was formed to promote studies of “non-homeostatic
brain-behavior mechanisms (to prevent) obesity”. This proposal directly addresses these needs by using novel
approaches to understand differences in neural function and behavior in preclinical obesity models. In people,
exposure to cues associated with food (food cues), like the smell of brownies or a blinking donuts sign, increases
food craving and the amount of food consumed. Obese people report stronger craving and eat larger portions in
response to food cues. Further, increases in activity of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) triggered by food cues
predict future weight gain inability to lose weight. Thus in people, enhanced neurobehavioral responses to food
cues contribute to obesity. But, the mechanism underlying this enhanced neurobehavioral reactivity is unknown.
Our long-term goal is to understand the neurobehavioral mechanisms that underlie enhanced cue-triggered
`cravings' that contribute to obesity. AMPA type glutamate receptors (AMPAR) provide the main source of
excitation to the NAc, and NAc activity is required for cue-triggered motivation in non-obese rats. My lab has
found that that cue-triggered food-seeking is stronger in obesity-susceptible males and females prior to obesity
and that consumption of a sugary, fatty `junk-food' diet enhances excitatory transmission within the NAc. Our
objectives here are to determine the role of NAc glutamatergic plasticity in cue-triggered food-seeking after junk-
food exposure, and the degree to which junk-food-induced glutamate plasticity occurs in specific circuits and
NAc cell types. These studies address significant gaps in our current understanding of diet-induced plasticity
that drives obesity. Our studies will provide key insights into the neural basis of cue-triggered motivation and
help delineate behavioral processes and specific circuits involved in both sexes, and as a function of obesity-
susceptibility. Eating is often initiated by food cues and eating in response to food cues contributes to human
obesity. Thus, this work inform treatment by providing a better understanding of the neurobiological
underpinnings of cue-triggered motivation in relevant preclinical models."
10816569,"Project Summary/Abstract
Dementia is a common disorder that increases in frequency in the elderly. Dementia is a progressive loss of
thinking and memory skills that eventually results in an inability to care for oneself and to live independently.
The most common cause of dementia in older Americans is Alzheimer’s disease, which develops as a result
of multiple lifestyle/environmental factors and inherited or familial causes. Many familial traits (such as the risk
of developing Alzheimer’s disease are inherited genetically, through gene variants (sequences of a chemical
code called DNA). The most common genetic variant that increases the risk of Alzheimer’s disease in older
adults (ie above age 60) is called APOE4. Although we have known for over 25 years that inheriting an
APOE4 genetic variant (also called an allele) increases Alzheimer’s disease risk, it is unclear how and why
APOE4 increases this risk. Recent data has raised the possibility that APOE4 may act by increasing the
activation of the complement pathway, a set of proteins that are used by immune cells to kill and eat bacteria,
and that also play a role in “killing” and “eating” connections between nerve cells in the brain, known as
synapses. In this project, we will examine whether people that carry the APOE4 allele (either 1 or 2 copies of
this allele) have increased evidence of complement pathway activation in the fluid that bathes their brain and
spinal cord, known as the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We will also determine whether CSF complement
pathway activation in APOE4 allele carriers is associated with long term cognitive decline over a
7.5 year period. Finally, we will determine whether modulating APOE biology in vivo with a peptide that “mimics”
the disease-resistant APOE2 allele. This work will be performed using an advanced method that can measure
the levels of a large percentage of all proteins present in human CSF, and which can precisely measure the
levels of proteins in the complement pathway. Overall, this work will help us understand how and why APOE4
changes the function of the brain, and how and why it contributes to AD risk. This work is an early step
towards identifying proteins or pathways that could be targeted by drugs to prevent Alzheimer’s disease in
people that carry an APOE4 allele."

Mycobacterium abscessus (Mab) accounts for most pulmonary infections caused by fast-growing non-
tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). Incidence and prevalence rates are increasing throughout the developed
world, there is currently no reliable cure for Mab lung disease, and the drug development pipeline is limited to
repurposed and largely underperforming antibiotics. During the previous funding cycle, we have leveraged 2
decades of chemical matter, tools and concepts developed by the TB community to build an attractive anti-Mab
drug discovery portfolio of 8 novel advanced lead compounds with demonstrated efficacy in an
immunocompromised Mab mouse model. Meanwhile, we have optimized an immune-competent model with
separately acquired funds to address the caveats of immunodeficiency. We have also uncovered the intrinsic
mechanism by which Mab resists rifamycins and used this knowledge to synthesize 20- to 100-fold more potent
analogs with 50- to 100-fold improved pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic parameters. Using targeted drug
combination approaches, we have uncovered outstanding bactericidal synergies between (i) rifabutin,
moxifloxacin and tebipenem, and (ii) amoxicillin and each of sulopenem, tebipenem and cefuroxime, all oral -
lactams that are approved or in late clinical development, acting synergistically due to the combined inhibition of
complementary/redundant peptidoglycan synthesis enzymes. Building on these promising results, the major
goals of this renewal application are (i) to advance promising hits and optimize early leads, (ii) to populate the
Mab preclinical candidate pipeline and (iii) to identify all-oral bactericidal combination regimens ready to enter
clinical trials. Our team of antimycobacterial drug discovery experts in microbiology and pharmacology will
continue to leverage the successful partnerships established with external chemistry collaborators. As in the
previous funding cycle, we will access compound collections and medicinal chemistry support from academic
and Pharma partners, a business model that has proven successful. The hit-to-lead and lead optimization
programs will capitalize on our successes with a novel class of non-fluoroquinolone gyrase inhibitors, rifamycin
and non-rifamycin RNA polymerase inhibitors, to deliver leads and preclinical development candidates with
efficacy in the immuno-compromised and -competent mouse models. To prioritize trial-ready all-oral drug
combinations, we will focus our efforts on the bactericidal 2- and 3-drug backbones and combine these with
bacteriostatic and bactericidal oral drugs used for the treatment of M. abscessus. Combinations that preserve
bactericidal and sterilizing activity of the backbones will be prioritized for testing in both mouse models.
Our unique niche consists in a pragmatic approach focused on compound sets active against TB, novel
ligand/target pairs and late clinical development candidates or approved antibiotics, maximizing both short and
long-term chances of success, to accelerate the discovery of all-oral cures against Mab lung disease."
10799179,"Effective, clinically meaningful treatments are lacking for patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI),
which is associated with increased risk of transition to dementia. Cognitive training represents an important
therapeutic strategy. In our recently completed two-site, blinded, COG-IT trial (R01AG052440, PI Devanand),
107 participants with MCI were randomized to web-based cognitive videogames (computerized cognitive
training, n=51) or computerized crossword puzzles (n=56) for 12 weeks of intensive training followed by
booster sessions for a total of 78 weeks. Crossword puzzles were superior to computerized cognitive training
on the primary cognitive outcome (ADAS-Cog11; effect size 0.43 at 12 weeks and 0.34 at 78 weeks) and
function (Functional Activities Questionnaire) with decreased brain atrophy on MRI over 78 weeks. Building on
these findings, for this competitive renewal we propose a 78-week clinical trial, WORDFIT, involving 4 U.S.
academic sites that compares high dose crosswords (4 puzzles per week) to low dose crosswords (1 puzzle
per week) and a health education control group in the initial acute phase of 12 weeks. Subsequent booster
sessions will occur up to 78 weeks. Blinded assessments will occur at baseline and weeks 12, 32, 52, and 78.
Sample size will be 240 with 80 participants per group. Sites led by Dr. Devanand (PI) at Columbia and Dr.
Doraiswamy at Duke, who were the investigators in the COG-IT trial, will be joined by sites at University of
Miami (PI Dr. Philip Harvey) and University of Washington (PI Dr. Angela Hanson). On measures of cognition
(primary outcome ADAS-Cog14) and informant report of function (secondary outcome Functional Activities
Questionnaire), we hypothesize that the high dose crosswords will show superior efficacy to the control group
and that there will be an increasing trend in treatment effects across the three ordered groups (control < low
dose crosswords < high dose crosswords). We will evaluate changes in MRI hippocampal volume and cortical
thickness in relation to changes in cognition and function and explore whether reduction in plasma
neurofilament light (marker of neurodegeneration) and plasma ptau181 (marker of Alzheimer's Disease) will be
associated with efficacy for high dose crosswords compared to control. In summary, in our completed COG-IT
trial in MCI, home-based computerized crossword puzzles training showed superior efficacy to computerized
cognitive training on cognition and function with decreased brain atrophy over 78 weeks, but there was no
control group. If these findings are confirmed and expanded with two crossword conditions and a control group
in WORDFIT, crosswords training could become a low-cost, home-based, scalable, cognitive enhancement
tool for people with MCI, which is a common condition and major public health problem worldwide."
10799181,"We propose a novel approach for identifying skeletal trait patterns that predict fracture risk in older men and
women, independent of areal bone mineral density (aBMD). The breakthrough was finding that aBMD loss
results from different relative proportions of decline in bone mineral content (BMC) and increase in bone area
based on baseline external bone size. aBMD is often used as a surrogate of strength, and loss in aBMD is often
assumed to reflect loss in strength. However, this association has been predicated on an implicit assumption
that the proportion of BMC-declines to area-increases is similar among individuals which our data contradict. In
the proposed work, we will test the global hypothesis that external bone size is associated with variation in
strength-decline trajectory and fracture risk, independent of aBMD. This hypothesis is supported by preliminary
cadaveric studies showing different strength-age regressions for narrow and wide subgroups. Moreover, we
show that low aBMD may explain fracture risk within subgroups stratified by external bone size but did not explain
the two-fold increase in fracture risk between subgroups. Thus, we have identified limitations in the uniform
application of aBMD to predict fracture risk, suggesting that recognizing population heterogeneity is necessary
for advancing fracture risk prediction. To address these limitations, we will identify the structural traits that explain
fracture risk within subgroups and test the hypothesis that the structural traits predicting fracture risk differ among
the subgroups. We first leverage high resolution imaging and direct mechanical tests available for cadaveric
femurs to test the hypothesis that the structural trait patterns determining low femur strength vary with external
femur size (Aim 1). To systematically identify structural patterns associated with variation in fracture risk and
strength-decline trajectories, we will use statistical shape and trait modeling within a novel computational
framework to identify the specific structural patterns that best predict experimental strength and then test how
these associations differ with external size, sex, and race. We address how these structure-function relationships
change over time by leveraging existing longitudinal hip DXA data for elderly White men enrolled in the
Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study (MrOS) and elderly White women enrolled in Health ABC (Aim 2) and
elderly Black men and women enrolled in Health ABC (Aim 3). We will test the hypothesis that strength-decline
trajectories differ between baseline FN area tertiles for older men and women, and that the strength-trajectory is
associated with risk of fracture within tertiles. Successful completion of these aims will provide evidence of
multiple biomechanical pathways leading to reduced proximal femur strength in older men and women and will
identify sets of traits and trait interactions that best predict fracture risk for subgroups of individuals. This outcome
will explain why changes in aBMD track strength-decline for some but not all individuals, and will identify early
indicators of fragility fractures, providing a voice to what has been called a silent disease."

Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia and fourth most common cause of death.
Amyloid-beta (Aβ) plays a crucial role in initiation and progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
Removal of circulating Aβ would shift the equilibrium in Aβ levels between brain and blood towards
blood. This shift would deplete brain amyloid levels and improve memory. Three commercial monoclonal
antibodies Adecanumab (Biogen), Lacenumab (Eisai) and Donanemab (Eli Lilly) have been approved by
the FDA after showing cognitive improvement by reducing amyloid. Recombinant Technologies [RT] has
developed an extracorporeal apheresis device, namely, Amytrapper Catheter to sequester blood Aβ. The
device is built on our IP-protected active pharmacological ingredient [API], a tetrameric retro-inverso
(RI) peptide, named Amytrap peptide. The device is a medically viable catheter which is coated inside
with the API. Amytrap peptide prevents Aβ self-aggregation by binding to a specific motif on Aβ that
promotes its misfolding and self-aggregation. Amytrap peptide has been shown to bind both soluble and
insoluble forms of amyloid efficiently with little side effects. The API is superior in that it is a small
peptide, not an antibody and it does not trigger any immunological side effects.
Previous research through SBIR phases I and II met or exceeded the intended goals. We completed the
following quantitative milestones: 1) we obtained proof of concept for a prototype Amytrapper Catheter
device in vitro. It bound and retained biotinylated Aβ42 (spiked) in a concentration dependent manner
from circulating fluids including sera or plasma from mice, rat and humans, in vitro. 2) we have obtained
in vivo proof of concept for the device in AD model rats. Blood amyloid reduction coupled with
behavioral improvement was observed in these rats after catheter-apheresis. 3) we have obtained
preliminary proof of concept with the device to remove native amyloid from blood samples of a small
number of patients with AD. 4) Completed market research for the device by partnering with Bio Heath
Innovations (MD) with the help of an NIA-sponsored TABA program which produced encouraging
feedback from key opinion leaders including end users 5) We have raised outside funds through
partnership with Start Engine Capital LLC via Regulation CF and we plan to continue this effort. This
phase IIB proposal is a necessary and logical extension of our ongoing research and commercialization
efforts that will bring the device from bench to the patient. We plan to improvise and optimize the
Amytrapper catheter device. Reflecting on these goals, in this proposal, we plan: in aim 1. Scaled up
synthesis (GLP grade), optimization and characterization of API, in aim 2. Fine-tune and improvise
Amytrapper Catheter device utilizing amyloid-spiked human blood samples, in aim 3. Confirm preclinical
POC on the streamlined catheter device by testing Amytrapper Catheter on blood samples from AD
patients and in aim 4. Complete regulatory filing and FDA clearance for Amytrapper Catheter. We have
partnered with Connecticut Innovations Inc, a local biotech venture investment firm and SA Capital
Partners NY, to raise additional private funds. This phase 2B award is likely to attract a syndicate of
investors to help us succeed in our commercialization efforts. At the end of this study, we would have
completed an IDE (investigational new device exemption) with the FDA for an eventual first in human
[FIH] study. We present well defined goals with realistic milestones and deliverables that is supported by
established players and partners. We believe that removal of amyloid by this device in AD patients will
significantly improve their living conditions and complement existing therapeutic regimen."
10821391,"This project is inspired by the premise that signals and substrates extrinsic to the β-cell trigger cell cycle entry, and that reactivation of the cell cycle in β-cells would provide the potential for restoring β-cell mass and function in diabetes. Our published and preliminary data suggest that the translation factor eIF5A functions as an acute response factor that catalyzes translation of specific mRNAs, enabling cellular replication. Strikingly, eIF5A is the only protein containing the unique, polyamine-derived amino acid hypusine, which is required for its function. Hypusine formation occurs posttranslationally and is governed by two rate-limiting enzymes, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS). ODC generates intracellular polyamines from arginine (and indirectly from glutamine, proline, methionine, phenylalanine, leucine), and DHPS utilizes the polyamine spermidine to form hypusine on eIF5A. Collectively, we refer to the ODC/DHPS/eIF5A proteins as belonging to the “polyamine/hypusine pathway.” Because polyamine and hypusine productions can be manipulated by diet and/or small molecules, they represent real-world targets to intervene in β-cell growth and replication. We hypothesize that the pathway that generates polyamines and hypusine links nutritional signals (amino acids, glucose) to mRNA translation to enable adaptive β-cell replication. The strength of this Multi-PI R01 application is the collaborative effort between Drs. R. Mirmira (an expert in the polyamine/hypusine pathway in β-cells) and L. Alonso (an expert in β-cell replication); our Team is uniquely positioned with the relevant expertise, novel conditional knockout mice, and mRNA translation assessment tools to test this hypothesis. We propose the following 3 aims: Aim 1: Elucidate the mechanisms by which the polyamine/hypusine pathway governs adaptive β-cell proliferation in models of obesity and hyperglycemia. Aim 2: Characterize how polyamine biosynthesis functions as a nutrient-activated gatekeeper for the proliferative signal induced by the UPR in β-cells. Aim 3: Reveal an unusual function of eIF5A as a biosensor for amino acid and polyamine supply. We will use a comprehensive toolbox of state-of-the-art imaging and cell biology techniques and novel reagents, including the only collection of ODC/DHPS/eIF5A knockout mice, to reveal a role in β-cell proliferation for an otherwise enigmatic pathway. Therefore, the primary impact of this proposal is the identification and mechanisms of the polyamine/hypusine pathway in rodent and human β-cell replication."
10821392,"Project Summary
 Many aspects of cell biology as well as tissue physiology and the proper functioning of organisms are
essentially problems in material science. The structures and reactions that enable proper functioning of an
organism need to produce movements that are greater than those generated by random Brownian motion.
Cells need to build structures that are strong enough to resist gravitational forces as well as the mechanical
stresses that are generated by the same molecular structures and cellular assemblies that evolved to generate
movement and force. A related problem in soft matter is to understand the physical chemistry and dynamics of
the phospholipid bilayer that forms the cell membrane and orchestrates the signals generated at the cell
membrane and sent to the interior. This MIRA application combines two physical studies. One is focused on
the mechanical properties of purified biopolymer networks, intact cells, and whole tissues. The second
involves biophysical and biochemical characterizations of lipid bilayers containing anionic signaling lipids to
determine how these lipids distribute in the dynamic membrane and how this organization impacts their control
of intracellular protein targets.
 We have characterized and worked with theorists to explain the striking nonlinear elastic response of
semi-flexible polymeric networks, with emphasis on the cytoskeletal intermediate filament protein vimentin, and
shown how these physical models help explain cell and tissue mechanism. We have also shown how important
viscoelastic properties of the substrate are to cell phenotypes and have developed new materials by which to
study them. In membrane studies, we collaborate with molecular dynamics experts to produce a coherent
model of the structures and motions of anionic signaling lipids such as PIP2 ranging from the atomic to the
molecular, to the macroscopic membrane scale. Biochemical and cellular studies show that the spatial
distribution of these lipids in bilayers impacts the way they control cytoskeletal actin assembly at the
cytoplasm/membrane interface.
 Future work will build on these studies in three different areas. We will use our established models of
semiflexible networks to determine why vimentin networks, in contrast to those formed by stiffer polymers,
become stiffer when compressed, whereas crosslinked actin or microtubules become softer. We will also
extend our studies of extracellular polymers and cells to intracellular systems: cytoskeletal networks
containing membrane-bounded organelles, and crosslinked DNA or chromatin with the liquid particles and
organelles contained in the nuclear matrix. Here we will use our newly developed method to prepare intact
metabolically active nuclei surrounded by a thin layer or cytoplasm and a plasma membrane, and determine
how the perinuclear vimentin cage influences the structure and mechanical response of the nucleus.
Membrane studies will use our previous methods to alter PIP2 distribution in artificial bilayers and isolated cell
membranes, to study how similar changes in PIP2 distribution triggered by changes in intracellular Ca2+ or
cholesterol affect actin assembly in intact cells. We will also build on the MD simulations of relatively small
membrane systems to coarse grain simulations using the essential features identified by current all-atom
simulations. These will enable studies of systems that are large enough and followed for sufficient time to
produce phase transitions and nano-scale lipid clusters. These models will be used to predict how different
PIP2 binding proteins respond to lateral distribution of the lipid and test these ideas biochemically and in cells."

Aging of skeleton becomes more susceptible to develop autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
Increased osteoclast activity and bone resorption is partly responsible for deterioration of skeleton during aging.
We have shown that aberrant activation of osteoclast formation in the subchondral bone initiates uncoupled
remodeling activity to induce degeneration of joints in both RA and osteoarthritis (OA). The elevated osteoclast
activity in the subchondral bone is also responsible for the joint pain. However, the signaling mechanism of
increased osteoclast fusion and bone resorption is unclear in RA. Interestingly, sialic acid level in serum and
sialylation of cellular receptors continuously increase during with implication of skeleton aging and autoimmune
disease. We found that sialylation of TLR2 induced binding to Siglec15 to initiate osteoclast fusion for bone loss.
Trap+ mononuclear cells with RANKL undergo cell-cell fusion to form Trap+ multinuclear osteoclasts. The
mechanism of RANKL-induced osteoclast fusion and maturation are not fully understood. Our preliminary results
showed that RANKL induced transcription of α2,3-sialyltransferase ST3Gal1 in preosteoclasts. Noteworthy, the
sialylation of TLR2 by ST3Gal1 induces binding to Siglec15, a member of sialic acid-binding lectins of the
immunoglobulin superfamily, to promote osteoclast fusion for bone resorption.
In parallel, our preliminary results also showed that the binding of sialylated TLR2 to Siglec 15 induced biased
Th17 differentiation of CD4+ T cells at onset of RA development. We now know that Th17 T cells are involved in
nearly all major autoimmune diseases, including RA, multiple sclerosis (MS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It is critical to understand the divergent functions of Th17 cells in
homeostatic and disease states. Th17 cells also promote the maturation of B cells for autoimmune antibody
generation. Most importantly, our preliminary results showed that soyasaponin Bb, a triterpenoid saponin from
soy, effectively inhibited α2,3-sialyltransferases activity in both aged and RA mice. Thus, we hypothesize that
sialylation TLR2-induced osteoclast fusion and biased Th17 differentiation of CD4+ T cells during aging
accelerates skeleton deterioration susceptible to development of autoimmune disease such as RA. In
the proposed study, we will first characterize mechanism of sialylated TLR2-induced osteoclast fusion in Specific
Aim 1. We will then investigate the effect of sialylation of TLR2 on T cells at onset of RA. We will finally examine
the therapeutic effect of Soyasaponin Bb sialyltransferase inhibitor on RA. Inhibition of TLR2 sialylation by
soyasaponin Bb could mitigate age-induced biased differentiation of Th17 and osteoclast fusion."
10821474,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Sensory hypersensitivity, particularly in the auditory realm, is one of the most common and debilitating
features of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Not only is auditory hypersensitivity a core deficit and important
clinical problem in ASD, but it likely contributes to and reflects fundamental brain pathology that will extend to
more complex but less accessible features of autism, such as communication impairment and abnormal social
interaction. Thus, determining the nature of aberrant sound perception in ASD is a tractable model for
identifying core cellular and circuit alterations in ASD that also has direct clinical implications for unique
aspects of the disorder. I have developed novel behavioral paradigms to measure loudness growth and sound
intolerance in rodents. Using these tools, I determined that a well-validated rat model of Fragile X Syndrome
(FX), one of the leading inherited causes of ASD, exhibits exaggerated loudness perception and extreme
sound avoidance behavior, consistent with auditory hypersensitivity observed in a majority of FX individuals.
This proposal will combine these novel behavioral assays with high-density in vivo multi-electrode, ex vivo
whole-cell electrophysiological recordings, and novel cell-type specific chemogenetic manipulations to
determine how altered auditory network activity gives rise to aberrant sound perception and loudness
intolerance in Fmr1 KO animals. The results from these aims will: (1) offer insight into clinically relevant
features of FX and other autism-related disorders; (2) uncover fundamental neural disruptions at the core of
ASD pathophysiology; and (3) provide a novel platform for screening potential therapies for FX and ASD.
 The proposed research is both a logical extension and novel direction from my previous work in
neurodevelopmental disorders and the mechanisms of experience-dependent plasticity. With the guidance of
my mentor, co-mentors and collaborator, I will develop the experimental and intellectual tools for dissecting the
neural circuits involved the dynamic encoding of sensory information, and how these processes may be
disturbed in neurological disorders like autism and hyperacusis. The technical and professional training I would
receive here will be instrumental towards my ultimate goal of establishing an independent academic laboratory
where I can combine the above techniques to study how experience shapes functional brain circuits at multiple
levels of analysis, using the auditory system as a model that is also associated with direct clinical implications."

10872306,"Technology Research & Development Project 7: Cell Specific Proteomics
Abstract
One of the primary challenges of quantitative proteomics is the dilution of signal due to sampling. Therefore, in
this TR&D, we seek to create and refine three workflows to sample 10,000-100,000 cells of specific types prior
to proteoform-resolved analysis via top-down proteomics (TDP). We outline a plan of attack involving three
common varieties of clinical samples, namely peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (DBP 5), brain
sections (DBP 10, 12, and 13), diseased tissue (DBP 12 and 14) and solid tumors (DBP 9). We propose three
main strategies to achieve cell specificity and spatial localization, range from actively deployable fluorescence-
activated cell sorting (FACS), to the more venerable method of laser capture microdissection (LCM), to a novel,
more direct method, which employs a picosecond infrared laser (PIRL) to ablate intact proteins prior to top-down
proteomics. We will subsequently analyze collected cell-specific samples by our quantitative TDP platform in
both discovery and targeted modes, with the latter utilizing proteoform-specific assays already developed (like
for KRAS proteoforms in DBP 9) or the many more to emerge from TR&D 6 throughout the proposed granting
period. A specific example derives from our work with PBMCs in DBP 5 (kidney and liver transplant patients),
where a panel of 30 proteoforms has emerged from discovery work. From these candidates, we now need
determine which immune cells are most responsible for this signal through cell type-resolved sampling.
The resulting proteoform-resolved measurements will provide more precise, context-rich, and therefore valuable
data revealing how proteins operate in human disease. Although cell-specific TDP technology does not presently
exist, its development will unlock significant bottlenecks in protein-level science by sharply improved information
about molecular signatures in a proteoform- and cell-specific fashion. While several DBPs will benefit from the
sampling of specific cells and tissue regions prior to TDP by FACS, LCM, and PIRL, these technologies are
applicable to the spatial sampling of proteins within a wide variety of biological contexts, which will directly benefit
a broad range of studies in basic biological, translational and clinical research. The measurement capabilities
will also augment the national infrastructure in proteomics, helping to keep pace with an increasingly competitive
international landscape in science and technology."
10872307,"Driving Biomedical Projects
Abstract
The National Resource for Translational and Developmental Proteomics (NRTDP) will collaborate with
geographically diverse investigators to complete eight Driving Biomedical Projects (DBPs) seeking advances
that require top-down proteomics in four pillars of biomedical research. While these projects arise from disparate
areas of science and medicine, each project cannot be performed optimally with the technology available at this
point in time. These projects drive the Technology Research and Development (TR&D) projects of the
NRTDP forward – giving them a tangible and quantifiable goal with the overarching goal to impact and improve
human health. Our TR&D projects focus on specific technologies throughout the progression of each DBP from
accelerating top-down robustness to innovating novel targeted and discovery approaches from specific cell
types. Integrating parts of each TR&D project, we have arranged our eight DBPs around four pillars (described
in detail in the Overall section):
Specific Aim 1 (Pillar 1): Cancer Proteomics. Top-down proteomics of p53, RAS, and H3.3K27M.
Specific Aim 2 (Pillar 2): Immunoproteomics. Top-down analysis of multi-drug resistant ESKAPE pathogens
and identification of transplant rejection markers using quantitative top-down proteomics.
Specific Aim 3 (Pillar 3): Neuroproteomics. A specific focus on brain cancer and proteinopathies with roles in
neurodegeneration and aging.
Specific Aim 4 (Pillar 4): Cardiac Proteomics. Identifying the repertoire of ApoC-III proteoforms associated
with coronary artery disease.
It is through the integrated development of next generation proteomics technologies that we will be able to
achieve success in Driving Biomedical Projects within these four pillars. As these projects progress
throughout the lifetime of the grant, they will be reassessed and once technologies are matured, may be
translated into Collaboration and Service projects, allowing new biomedical problems to drive the next
generation of technology."
10789947,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is an essential genome maintenance pathway that detects and removes
harmful DNA lesions resulting from exposure to environmental carcinogens, toxins, alkylating agents, reactive
oxygen species and ultraviolet radiation. NER stands out among all DNA repair pathways for its ability to remove
the widest array of structurally unrelated lesions. The need to process a wide variety of damaged sites has given
rise to a remarkably complex molecular machinery. Defects in this machinery provide a paradigm for the diverse
clinical consequences of DNA damage and are associated with severe human diseases – 1) ultraviolet radiation-
sensitive syndrome; 2) xeroderma pigmentosum, characterized with extreme cancer predisposition; 3) cerebro-
oculo-facio-skeletal syndrome; 4) trichothiodystrophy; and 5) Cockayne syndrome, associated with premature
ageing and accelerated neurodegeneration. Furthermore, NER is intricately intertwined with other vital pathways
that orchestrate the expression and repair of genes. Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms of NER is
a grand challenge in biomedical science. Progress toward this goal has been hindered by the size, complexity
and dynamic nature of the assemblies that accomplish NER. To overcome this critical barrier to progress, we
will employ integrative modeling methods, combining state-of-the-art computation with experimental data from
cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), site-directed mutagenesis, crosslinking mass spectrometry (XL-MS),
hydrogen deuterium exchange (HDX) mass spectrometry and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to elucidate
the assembly, function and regulation of key NER complexes. Specifically, our focus is on transcription factor
IIH (TFIIH) as the centerpiece of the NER machinery. In Aim1, we will elucidate the functional dynamics of TFIIH
and discover key allosteric residue networks enabling the function of this recognized NER master coordinator.
We will also decipher the effects of TFIIH disease mutations, providing a novel paradigm for the diverse clinical
manifestations of NER impairment. In Aim2, we will unravel the mechanisms of TFIIH-associated lesion scanning
and DNA damage verification. In Aim3, we will synthesize diverse structural data to create an integrative model
of the most crucial intermediate in NER – the pre-incision complex. Hybrid models will define the structural
elements allowing TFIIH to serve as a mobile platform for the assembly and remodeling of the NER machinery.
Our work will benefit from synergistic collaborative interactions with world-class experimental groups to inform,
validate, and extend our models. Parallel computational and experimental advances will yield key insights into
the structure, dynamics and function of NER complexes while making direct connection to genetic disease
phenotypes. Success of the project will thus have major impacts - both in understanding disease etiology and in
offering a structural framework to devise effective treatments."

10824296,"Early detection of ovarian cancer using screening algorithms is ineffective, even in high-risk populations.
Patients who carry germline mutations, such as BRCA, have limited options to lower their ovarian cancer risk,
short of removing their ovaries and fallopian tubes. There is a critical need for novel methods to prevent
ovarian cancer without the negative consequences of surgical menopause.
Drugs that inhibit OXPHOS, such as atovaquone, have potential as effective chemoprevention agents.
Atovaquone is a mitochondrial complex III inhibitor. Preliminary data from our laboratory support atovaquone's
ability to effectively block OXPHOS by interfering with mitochondrial electron transport. Atovaquone is currently
FDA approved for the treatment of malaria, and is a well-tolerated, orally available medication. It slows ovarian
cancer growth in vitro and in vivo and increases p53-related apoptosis.
Hypothesis: We hypothesize that atovaquone will block oxidative phosphorylation, increase oxidative stress,
and potentially activate p53-mediated apoptosis, preventing precursor lesions from progressing to ovarian
cancer in a genetically engineered mouse model.
Aim 1. Examine the role of atovaquone in delaying the onset of ovarian cancer in an OVGP1 mouse
model. The OVGP1 BPRN genetically engineered mouse model is based on fallopian tube transformation and
mimics human high-grade serous carcinoma development. This mouse model will be used to determine if
atovaquone delays the onset of ovarian cancer in mice predisposed to develop this disease. Additional studies
will investigate short-term transcriptome changes seen in the ovary and fallopian tube that could serve as
additional exploratory biomarkers in our proposed window-of-opportunity clinical trial.
Aim 2. Complete a window of opportunity clinical trial examining the effects of atovaquone on normal
fallopian tube and ovarian epithelium in patients undergoing planned gynecologic surgery. Eligible
patients will be women scheduled to undergo removal of at least one fallopian tube for benign indications.
Baseline cytology sampling of the fallopian tube will be performed using office hysteroscopy. Cells collected
can be used for transcriptome analysis. The subjects will be exposed to atovaquone for 25-35 days pre-
operatively. MDA expression, a marker of inhibition to OXPHOS, will be measured after atovaquone exposure
to confirm its proposed mechanism of action. IHC expression for p53 and p53 phosphorylation will be
performed. Additional biomarkers from our mouse work may be added.
Aim 3. Investigate potential barriers to atovaquone therapy. The Nrf-2 chemoresistance mechanisms
pertinent to oxidative phosphorylation will be explored. It is critical to develop strategies to overcome the
antioxidant mechanisms induced by Nrf-2 regulated genes, including superoxide dismutase (MnSOD),
catalase, and hemoxygenase-1 (HO-1)."
10824306,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Motor acts such as reaching often rely upon the primary motor cortex (M1) for their execution. Oscillatory
activities in M1 accompany motor actions, with the dominant electroencephalographic correlate of those actions
being event-related desynchronization (ERD), a loss of low frequency power during movement onsets.
Intracerebral recordings in humans, monkeys, and rodents have found that ERD co-occurs with movement
associated gamma oscillations in M1. Gamma has received increased attention as a therapeutic target because
it is altered in several movement disorders and affected by transcranial stimulation. However, the microcircuitry
and function of gamma oscillations in M1 are not well studied. Given the abundance of specialized projection
neurons in M1, it is crucial to understand how they are coordinated by gamma in normal subjects. In other cortical
circuits, gamma oscillations depend on the interaction between principal cells (PNs) and fast-spiking
interneurons (FSIs). In M1, projection-specific PN subtypes differ in their connectivity with FSIs, suggesting that
they are differentially regulated by gamma. This project seeks to understand how gamma oscillations during
reaching orchestrate three major classes of PNs in M1: pyramidal tract, corticostriatal, and corticothalamic. In
Aim 1, local field potentials and single unit activity in M1 are recorded during a skilled reaching task in rats.
Extracellular spike waveform characteristics will be used to identify FSIs, while PNs will be classified with
antidromic stimulation. Paw kinematics will be tracked to measure reaching. For each PN subtype, we will
characterize entrainment to gamma, coordination with FSIs, and reaching correlates. Aim 2 dissects the circuit
mechanisms underlying any projection-specific differences in gamma entrainment. For each pair of PN subtypes,
one will be made to selectively express the excitatory opsin ChroME, while the other will be labeled with GFP.
In M1 brain slices, whole-cell patch clamp recordings will be made from both populations during gamma induced
by optogenetic ramp stimuli. This will reveal the ability for the opsin-bearing population to induce local gamma,
and how sensitive the GFP population is to it. Voltage clamp recordings will reveal the relative contributions of
EPSCs and IPSCs to these rhythms, further illuminating circuit mechanisms. Lastly, Aim 3 assesses the
behavioral importance of gamma entrainment. During the reaching task closed-loop optogenetic modulation of
each of the PN subtypes will be delivered to bias their spiking either in- or out-of-phase with ongoing M1 gamma.
The effect this has on gamma amplitude, behavioral performance, and the unstimulated projection PNs, will be
determined. Altogether, these aims offer a comprehensive characterization of how M1 gamma coordinates the
output microcircuitry, clarifies its physiology, and tests its behavioral relevance. Those insights are necessary for
deepening our understanding of oscillatory activities in M1 and motor disordes, and perfecting future therapies."

demonstrated significant benefits due to multiple factors including inconsistent delivery. ONE (Opioid and
Naloxone Education) is our innovative approach to screening and educating patients who receive prescribed
opioid medications. The program has been implemented in community pharmacies in three states and has
demonstrated positive outcomes including naloxone dispensing for high risk opioid prescriptions that is six times
the national average. Currently, the ONE program’s screening tool is paper-based, with the collected data
retrospectively entered into pharmacy computers. This proposal intends to integrate the tools and process
developed by the ONE Program into a digital platform on tablet PCs to improve the ability to consistently deliver
screening for opioid risk and provide targeted opioid safety interventions based on individual risk factors. Oprems
and North Dakota State University researchers will provide tablets with the digital platform to select community
pharmacy locations currently using the paper-based ONE screening tool. The tablet will collect additional
information on patient interaction with the digital screening tools, including the hesitation answering certain
questions, changed answers, and other variables which can be used to assess the functionality and validity of
the screening tools. These data will undergo statistical analysis to determine whether the digital platforms aid in
predicting potential opioid misuse and overdose and serve as another input to a robust screening process.
Concurrently, other predictive indicators for opioid misuse will be identified, including factors not currently
available, to support their assessment and to generate a longer-term target analytical model. The artificial
intelligence (AI) incorporated into the digital platform will be utilized to characterize patient actions and identify
patient behavioral characteristics that may indicate uncertainty, deceptive intent, or concern. Characteristics
associated with opioid misuse, overdose or overdose-related deaths will be used to identify the screening
elements with the most impact. Qualitative data gathered by surveys of pharmacy staff will be used to determine
how the digital platform fits into clinical workflow. Lastly, the digital platform will be compared to existing paper-
based ONE Program results to establish if there are significant differences in predictive efficacy. The research
will result in a consistent product suited for incorporation into FDA opioid REMS programs."

This renewal project builds on the successful first five years of progress during the initial award, which focused
on utilizing American Community Survey (ACS) data and curricular materials to introduce demographic
perspectives to undergraduates in a wide spectrum of courses. This project will make ACS-based curricular
materials available to undergraduates in many undergraduate courses in order to expose them to demographic
approaches as applied to different subject areas, as well as to pathways toward careers in population related
fields. The ACS, as a successor to the US Census long form, provides the potential for undergraduates to
explore a wide range of topics. Through this exploration, undergraduates encounter demographic
perspectives, in a way that will familiarize them with frameworks, concepts and analysis techniques commonly
utilized by demographers, thus exposing them to the field of demography in courses whose content they do not
necessarily associate with population studies. This renewal project will update and expand the creation of data
and curricular materials that are accessible to undergraduates, by working directly with undergraduate
teachers in workshops and follow up webinars, and by enhancing our general use web instructional materials.
Further, in response to requests by earlier participants and reviewers, it will broaden the training opportunities
by introducing an advanced analysis tier of training for teachers interested in accessing ACS data with more
sophisticated software and web portals. In addition, by working with graduate training population programs
and the faculty teacher network, the project's website and staff will provide information to interested
undergraduates about graduate training and careers in the population field and work actively to connect them
with those opportunities."

A growing literature documents Black-White inequalities in sleep deficiencies with Black adults experiencing
less sleep and lower sleep quality compared to White adults. Because sleep hygiene is tightly linked to health,
racial inequalities in sleep deficiencies may be a key determinant of racial inequalities in health. Racial
inequalities in work-related stress may be a key, but understudied driver of sleep inequalities and ultimately,
health inequalities. As with all racial groups, the majority of Black men and women are in the labor force;
however, compared to White adults, Black adults spend more time in the workplace, are more likely to hold
multiple jobs – and twice as likely to hold two full-time jobs. Further compared to White adults, Black adults
tend to be in occupations that are objectively more stressful, where they have less control and greater physical
and emotional demands, and to report greater levels of stress at work. While work-related stress has been
linked to sleep deficiencies, there is a need to examine more racially-salient forms of stress such as vigilance,
or the thoughts and behaviors in which Black Americans may engage in order to navigate everyday spaces
such as the workplace. A substantial qualitative literature indicates that Black adults regularly anticipate and
worry about potential encounters in everyday life such as being followed in stores or having assumptions made
about their intellect or character. Vigilance may be particularly important for sleep inequalities because it
captures a racially-salient and prevalent for of stress with characteristics that interfere with sleep quality and
duration, including: (a) anticipatory stress, which predicts increased biological stress even in the absence of a
stressful event; and (b) ruminative stress, which can transform acute situations into chronic sources of stress.
Using both real-world and laboratory settings, we propose to collect data from 500 Black men and women to
capture both momentary work-related stressful experiences and chronic work-related stress. We propose to
examine the linkages between racially-salient, work-related stress, captured through ecological momentary
assessments (EMA), and sleep deficiencies, captured through self-report and actigraphy. The workplace is
particularly relevant for racial inequalities in health due to focus on economic upward mobility among Black
Americans and the growth of diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives that may widen inequalities due to the
need for vigilance as Black workers join predominantly White workplaces."
10825621,"Heart failure is often marked by stiffening of cardiac tissue that impairs the heart’s ability to relax. The microtubule network – a part of the cardiomyocyte cytoskeleton – provides an internal stiffness that can impede cardiomyocyte contraction and relaxation. We have recently found that cardiomyocyte microtubule network stiffness is tightly regulated by post-translational detyrosination and that microtubules, detyrosination, and cytoskeletal cross-linkers are consistently elevated in heart failure, with concomitant increases in cardiomyocyte stiffness. Our findings that reducing detyrosination lessens microtubule network density and contractile defects in cardiomyocytes from patients with advanced heart failure supports detyrosination as a therapeutic target. At the same time, these findings raise important questions about the processes driving remodeling of the microtubule network in heart failure and the consequences of sustained increases in the microtubule network over time. Accordingly, the proposed research will test the hypothesis that remodeling of the cardiac microtubule network is a reversible adaptation to altered mechanical stress, which when sustained, contributes to pathological hypertrophy and contractile dysfunction. Studies under three aims will address the multiple components of this hypothesis. Aim 1 experiments will determine if mechanical stress is sufficient to drive cell-autonomous remodeling of the microtubule network using a mechanobiology toolkit to isolate the contribution of three key mechanical stressors (pre-load, after-load, and matrix stiffness) on microtubule network remodeling. Aim 2 experiments will extend our mechanical manipulations to the tissue and organ level to characterize microtubule network remodeling under relevant in vivo contexts. Aim 3 studies will employ in vitro and in vivo genetic manipulations to determine whether sustained increases in detyrosination contribute to pathologic cardiac hypertrophy in the presence and absence of chronic pressure overload. Our overall study design uses novel and complementary experimental approaches to both exploit strengths of model systems and mitigate their shortcomings. This includes primary cardiomyocytes from human myocardium to complement findings from animal models and engineered tissue constructs. This cross-species, multi-scale approach balances the dual goals of reductionist rigor and integrative relevance that furthers ultimate clinical translation. Together this work will provide insight into the causes of microtubule network changes in heart failure and help determine if preventing or reversing these changes is therapeutically beneficial."

The goal of this project is to functionalize quantitation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) huntingtin (HTT) protein as a
Huntington disease (HD) biomarker. The first Phase I/IIa HTT lowering clinical trial for the treatment of HD
recently concluded demonstrating dose-dependent reduction of mutant HTT (mtHTT) protein in the CSF of
treated patients. The use of this measure was based on our previous work using a novel ultrasensitive mtHTT
detection assay to demonstrate that suppression of HTT in the entire mouse CNS results in correlative reduction
of CSF mtHTT, but further studies are required for meaningful use of this measure in the clinic. The therapeutic
under trial is expected to mostly be active in superficial brain regions, while other strategies in development are
expected to mostly be active in deeper brain regions or specific cell types. For this reason, it is necessary to
know the regional and cell type contributions to CSF mtHTT in order to predict what a treatment-induced change
means for the targeted tissue(s). Comparison of brain and CSF mtHTT in mice that express mtHTT everywhere
except the brain region or cell type at study to those with ubiquitous mtHTT expression will be used to discern
the proportional contributions to CSF mtHTT and provide a way to infer magnitude of treatment-induced changes
in the brain by those in CSF. It will also be necessary to know how mtHTT enters CSF. Comparison of brain and
CSF HTT in systems with and without neurodegeneration will be used to distinguish passive release of HTT as
cells die and break open from active transport of HTT to CSF. Furthermore, the kinetics of brain clearance of
mtHTT will be delineated by ectopic delivery of intra- or extracellular mtHTT protein directly to the brains of mice
and subsequent measurement of brain, CSF, and plasma mtHTT at multiple post-delivery time points.
Perturbation of HTT secretion and the glymphatic system will be used to investigate how mtHTT moves from
inside cells of the brain to the CSF and eventually the blood. Concurrently, mtHTT will be quantified in longitudinal
CSF and plasma samples from HD patients and controls and compared to phenotypic data to determine how
biofluid mtHTT changes over typical clinical trial intervals and with progression in individuals, thus separating
time- and treatment-dependent changes. This will also determine if CSF mtHTT concentration can be used to
more accurately predict disease conversion and progression. We will also attempt to quantify wtHTT protein in
CSF to investigate potential extracellular functions of HTT as well as enable allelic discrimination for trials of
selective agents. The results of these studies will provide the necessary basis to interpret clinical quantitation of
CSF HTT, determine which types of therapeutics could be effectively evaluated by this measure, and ascertain
the predictive value of longitudinal CSF HTT quantitation in monitoring HD progression and selecting clinical trial
participants."
10825626,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Somatic post-zygotic mutations are increasingly recognized as a cause of neurologic disorders ranging from
epilepsy to autism to neurodegeneration. Somatic mutations accumulate with each cell division during fetal life,
a developmental process of not yet fully defined scale and mechanism, hampering interpretation of disease
states. The first part of this study implements a clinically applicable somatic-aware algorithm to identify early
somatic mutations that lead to epilepsy and brain malformations. The latter aspect applies cutting-edge single-
cell DNA technology to human fetal brain in order to define the rates and mechanisms driving accumulation of
somatic mutations in neurons during normal development. The insights from this study have the potential to
impact the detection and diagnosis of somatic disorders in clinical practice, and defines the scope of normal
brain developmental mosaicism in neurons to serve as a framework for future studies of neurological disease.
 The candidate’s career goal is to become an independent physician-scientist contributing to the
understanding of genetic and functional implications of post-zygotic mutations in childhood neurological
disorders. The candidate trained clinically in child neurogenetics with deep research experience, including in
cellular and molecular biology and statistical analysis, acquired in the cancer field. During the mentored training
period, the candidate will prioritize activities to transition skills from a cancer background to human genetics and
neuroscience: specifically working with primary human postmortem tissue, single cell analytical methods, and
evaluating genotype-phenotype relationships in somatic disorders, and additionally, preparing for a transition to
independence. The candidate will be mentored by Dr. Christopher Walsh, a renowned neurobiologist who has
mentored dozens of successful independent investigators and will be supported by an advisory team with
expertise in epilepsy, neuroscience, and bioinformatics. The proposed research and training plan will take place
in the laboratory of Dr. Walsh at Boston Children’s Hospital (BCH), which is affiliated with Harvard Medical School
and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, embedded within a world-class life sciences community of the Boston-
Cambridge area. The candidate will benefit from both the outstanding resources and intellectual community of
this tremendous network in addition to the close-knit communities within the BCH Department of Neurology and
Division of Genetics."

10827455,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – METABOLOMICS CORE
Comprehensive metabolic analysis, or “metabolomics”, is a technology that defines the chemical phenotype of
living systems. Given that metabolic fluxes and metabolite levels are downstream of genomic, transcriptomic,
and proteomic variability, metabolomics provides a highly integrated profile of biological status. As such, it has
unique potential for discovery of biomarkers that predict disease incidence, severity, and progression, and for
casting new light on underlying mechanistic abnormalities. Metabolomic analyses are challenging, however, due
to the complexity inherent in measuring large numbers of intermediary metabolites with diverse chemical
properties in a quantitatively rigorous and reproducible fashion. The DMPI Metabolomics Core Lab has a long
history of collaborative research and has established a strong and reliable infrastructure for conducting
measurements for investigators at Duke and at outside institutions. Thus, it is well poised to become the NCDRC
Metabolomics Core. While Duke has world-renowned facilities for metabolomics, its use by diabetes
investigators outside of Duke (such as WF and UNC researchers) has been limited by bottlenecks, particularly
in the analysis and interpretation of data, which the NCDRC seeks to address by establishing the NCDRC
Metabolomics Core with support from Research Navigators."
10911203,"Significance: This project evaluates access to emergency care for Veterans with particular emphasis on:
assessing resources and capabilities of VA EDs to care for Veterans during times of crisis, determining where
care is provided (VA vs. non-VA EDs), and understanding how and why Veterans make decisions regarding
where to seek emergency care. The objectives of this proposal are directly responsive to HSRD priority areas
(Access and Health systems change) and three of the VA Breakthrough priority areas (Improve Access to
Health Care, Improve Community Care, and Improve the Veteran Experience). We also address Secretary
Shulkin's priority areas (Choice Act, improve infrastructure). Dr. Vashi and her team have strong ties to VA and
non-VA operational and policy partners, including the VA National Director of Emergency Medicine, which will
be instrumental in translating research findings into meaningful improvements in policy.
 Background and Innovation: Emergency care is a critical but understudied part of the continuum of
health care services offered to Veterans by the VA. While the VA is committed to providing timely and high-
quality emergency care, surprisingly little is known about Veteran access to acute care or about the quality of
care provided. Variations in VA emergency care resources are not well understood and prevent Veterans from
making informed choices. Moreover, eligibility for non-VA ED care is confusing, complex and can translate to
delays in treatment and poor outcomes. VA estimates that current VA users get, on average, only about 38%
of their ED visits from VA, yet no study to date has examined emergency care Veterans receive in non-VA
settings. While use of non-VA EDs may sometimes be appropriate, there are other times when the ED care
could have been provided at the VA and use of the non-VA ED may result in duplicative care and delays. This
dual use matters to the VA because, like an Accountable Care Organization, the VA is still responsible for the
overall health of the Veteran and often the expenses even when Veterans receive care outside of the VA.
 Aims: Objectives of this proposal are: (1) To create survey items that facilitate a comprehensive inventory
of VA ED resources and capabilities; (2) to calculate VA and non-VA ED utilization rates and identify the
patient, facility, and community-level predictors of VA ED use and VA reliance; and (3) to characterize
Veterans' preferences, resources and contextual factors that influence ED setting choice (i.e. VA, non-VA).
 Methods: We will build on pilot work and convene an advisory panel to create and add survey items to the
next ED survey to assess VA ED resources and capabilities and determine how they vary (e.g. region, rurality,
complexity). Using an innovative linkage method, we will use VA, Medicare, and California data to examine ED
use across groups. Further, we will assess the patient, facility, and community level predictors of Veterans'
choice of delivery system and VA reliance. All analyses will be conducted for three cohorts: a national
accountable veteran population (Veterans 65+), residents of California (Veterans 65+), and residents of
California (Veterans 18-64). Finally, we will conduct semi-structured interviews with Veterans
to better understand why Veterans choose to receive their ED care inside or outside the VA. As underscored
by the Secretary, our methods rely on “what Veterans actually tell us” and lay the groundwork for future
comparisons of VA and non-VA ED quality metrics.
 Expected results: We will determine capabilities of VA EDs nationwide and examine the impact of these
factors on VA ED use and reliance. Further by analyzing data and speaking with Veterans, we will better
understand where and why Veterans access the acute care system (in both VA and non-VA settings) and will
identify barriers in access amendable to future intervention and policy changes. Once we can identify patients
receiving care outside the VA and determine why they made that decision, we can then develop interventions
to keep Veterans “in-network” when appropriate."

Candidate’s Long-Term Career Goal. Dr. Munroe’s goal is to become an independent physician-scientist
leading clinical trials to improve sepsis survival and recovery. Through the training outlined in this F32 award,
she will gain the skills necessary to perform advanced statistical analyses, conduct randomized surveys, and
begin to design and develop clinical trials, which will be instrumental in her achieving this goal.
Clinical Problem to be Addressed. Sepsis is a major cause of mortality and morbidity, leading to 1 in every 2
to 3 hospital deaths in the US and causing long-term impairment for many survivors. Vasopressors are broadly
recommended to treat the most severe form of sepsis, septic shock, but the most effective method(s) for
delivering vasopressors is unclear. Dr. Munroe’s early work has shown that there is wide variation in hospital
policies on vasopressor administration routes and revealed that there is a lack of systematic knowledge about
how vasopressors are administered in practice and how variation in these practices affects patient outcomes.
Candidate Background. Dr. Munroe is a clinical Pulmonary and Critical Care fellow at the University of
Michigan (U-M). She received her MD with Alpha Omega Alpha honors (2016), completed Internal Medicine
residency (2019), and was selected to serve as Chief Resident (2019-2020) at the University of Chicago. She
was recruited to U-M for fellowship in 2020, where she has begun to develop expertise in early sepsis
management and vasopressor practices, with 4 first-author publications and 2 national conference
presentations. Her Department has a strong commitment to supporting her academic career, including
selecting her to join a T32 grant in June 2022. She is currently completing a Master’s in Health Care Research.
Career Development Plan. Dr. Munroe proposes building on her early research experience and Master’s
training to develop expertise in multi-level modeling, risk-adjustment, and survey design, as well as to pursue
preliminary training in clinical trial development.
Mentors. Her primary mentor is Dr. Hallie Prescott at the U-M, who has mentored 3 clinician-scientists on K
awards. Dr. Munroe and Dr. Prescott have an excellent track record of success, working together since 2020.
Aims. In the first aim, Dr. Munroe will assess practice patterns, outcomes, and complications of vasopressor
administration routes in sepsis using two complementary, multi-hospital datasets—the NHLBI-funded
CLOVERS trial and a diverse 69-hospital Michigan registry. In the second aim, she will expand on these
findings by conducting a national randomized clinical vignette survey of ICU providers to determine factors
associated with provider decisions about vasopressor administration.
Deliverables for Aims. Dr. Munroe’s aims will lead to 2-3 first-author publications yearly and representation at
2 national conferences per year. The results will serve as pilot data for her K23 application, which will focus on
conducting a pilot trial to optimize vasopressor delivery in early sepsis."

The phylum of Spirochetes forms an evolutionarily and structurally unique group of bacteria. Spirochetes are
ubiquitous in nature due to their ability to adapt and colonize a wide range of environments and hosts. This
diverse phylum includes pathogens associated with human and zoonotic diseases, such as Lyme disease,
relapsing fever borreliosis, periodontal diseases, syphilis, endemic trepanemotoses, leptospirosis and
dysentery. The global burden of spirochetal diseases, lyme disease, syphilis and leptospirosis in particular,
continues to increase annually due to a variety of factors, including climate changes. In addition, they
participate in polymicrobial infections and host-bacterial endosymbioses, and they are models for vector-borne,
environmental, and zoonotic infections. Due to the extreme divergence of spirochetes as compared to model
microorganisms and their fastidious nature, our knowledge about the general biology of spirochetes is still
limited. The Biology of Spirochetes GRC (BoS GRC) and the accompanying GRS (BoS GRS), which is
organized by and targeted to researchers in training, have been held every two years since 1994 and serve as
the only scientific meetings that bring together researchers who work on this structurally and taxonomically
unique phylum of bacteria. The 2024 BoS GRC and GRS programs have been designed to highlight the
diversity of research in spirochete biology and disease pathogenesis. Our first Aim is to promote presentation
and discussion of diverse and cutting-edge research on spirochete disease pathogenesis and spirochete
biology, including host interactions and defenses, immune evasion and persistence mechanisms, ecology and
evolution, and structural biology and physiology. Our second Aim is to promote career development for all
scientists studying spirochetes. To achieve these Aims, we have invited 37 speakers to the 2024 BoS GRC,
many of whom are first-time attendees and the majority of them have never been invited for talks at the GRC.
We have reserved thirteen speaking slots for “poster talks” that will be selected from the abstracts submitted by
attendees for poster presentations. The BoS GRS will include oral presentations, poster presentations, and
panel discussions focused on career options and on harassment in science. Outcomes of the harassment
discussion will be summarized in the BoS GRC. The BoS GRC will include a “Power Hour”, an informal
gathering for all meeting participants to address the challenges women and underrepresented minorities face
in science and to support their professional growth in science. Both the GRC and the GRS programs reflect the
diversity of the research and the scientists in the field, with strong representation of women and international
scientists as both speakers and discussion leaders. The vast majority of the major advances in spirochete
research during the past 20 years evolved from the discussions and collaborations fostered by the BoS GRC:
the 2024 conferences endeavor to continue this laudable trajectory."

One in 10 pregnant women in the United States smokes at the beginning of pregnancy, increasing the risk of
miscarriage, preterm birth, low birth weight, and neonatal death. Among these women who smoke, virtually all
report a desire to quit, yet only 25% abstain throughout pregnancy. A known behavioral economic mechanism
behind this “intention-action gap” is delay discounting (DD), the tendency to discount delayed outcomes
when choosing present actions. Because the negative consequences of smoking are delayed, whereas its
benefits are immediate, DD reinforces tobacco use even when one desires abstinence. In pregnancy, existing
smoking cessation pharmacotherapies are generally considered unsafe and/or ineffective, and thus DD may
provide a novel therapeutic target for smoking cessation treatment. However, three critical knowledge gaps
currently limit this possibility: (1) the optimal approach to measuring DD in the context of addiction is unclear,
(2) the longitudinal relationship between DD and smoking in pregnancy is poorly characterized, and (3) no
pharmacologic agent for reducing DD that is safe in pregnancy is known. To address these gaps, I will pursue
a set of training and research activities centered around “Measuring and Modifying Delay Discounting as a
Mechanism of Smoking in Pregnancy (The MM-DD Study)”. Leveraging (1) the Effort Delay Discounting Task
(EDDT), a novel mobile phone-based instrument that I have developed for measuring DD based on willingness
to exert cognitive and physical effort, (2) a mentorship committee with expertise in nicotine dependence,
behavioral economics, neuroscience, and structural equation modeling, and (3) an ongoing NIH-sponsored
RCT of high-dose omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation for pregnant smokers, my SPECIFIC
AIMS are to: (1) jointly measure and test the factor structure of cognitive effort DD, physical effort DD, and
monetary DD, (2) characterize the longitudinal relationship between DD and smoking in pregnancy, and (3)
safely test the modifiability of DD in pregnancy through a clinical trial. In parallel with these Aims, building on
previous training in behavioral economics, I will pursue four integrated training objectives, in which I will gain:
(1) advanced expertise in DD research, (2) foundational knowledge of the neurobiology of addiction, (3)
competence in structural equation modeling, and (4) skills to build scholarly productivity in biomedical
research. IMPACT: This career development award will (1) advance addiction science by systematically
measuring and attempting to modify DD as a novel therapeutic target for smoking cessation in pregnancy and
(2) advance my career by enabling me to secure R01 funding to further investigate novel approaches to
measuring and modifying DD across addiction contexts. In so doing, this award will position me to become an
independent investigator of interventions that prevent and treat addiction by targeting its behavioral economic
mechanisms, including DD."

Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States and has increased by 35% in the last two
decades. Emergency Departments (EDs), often serving as the only clinical contact for individuals at risk for
suicide, are a critical point for initiating suicide prevention interventions. Limited availability of psychiatric beds
and challenges with linking to, or sustaining, post-ED care exacerbate the already heightened risk for suicidal
behavior among discharged individuals. Best-practice guidelines for EDs recommend providing individuals at
elevated suicide risk with brief interventions that include safety planning—emphasizing coping strategies to
mitigate suicidal crises—as well as post-discharge contacts, however busy EDs often lack adequate resources
to offer these interventions consistently or with fidelity. New approaches that can provide accessible,
personalized, and resource-efficient continuity of care are urgently needed to prevent suicidal behavior during
the high-risk post-ED period. Leveraging accessible technologies, we propose to develop and pilot an ED-
initiated intervention package that incorporates an electronic safety plan (ESP) and adaptive text-based
support to facilitate effective post-discharge coping and safety plan use, and ultimately reduce suicidal
behavior in high-risk adults. Adults presenting to an ED for suicide-related concerns (N=120) will be
randomized to ESP (n=40) or ESP + text-based support program (n=80) delivered for a month after discharge.
The ESP + text-based support condition will include an embedded micro-randomized trial (MRT), with twice-
daily randomizations over the month-long intervention, to optimize the frequency, timing, and content of
messages and to inform the design of a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) for suicide prevention. Follow-
ups will occur at 1 and 3 months, as well as twice-daily for the first month after discharge. The specific aims
are to: (1) Develop and refine ESP and text-based support with stakeholder input; (2) Demonstrate feasibility,
acceptability, and explore initial impact on mechanisms (coping self-efficacy, motivation for safety plan use)
and distal outcomes (e.g., suicidal ideation severity), assessed at 1 and 3 months, for ESP with text-based
support compared to ESP alone; and (3) Conduct a pilot MRT to inform the optimization of adaptive text-based
support (JITAI). Specifically, through the series of micro-randomizations, we will explore if provision of (a) any
coping message, (b) a specific type of coping message (untailored vs. ESP-tailored; with or without dynamic
personalized feedback based on daily-level functioning), and (c) message timing (e.g., morning vs. evening)
influence daily-level proximal mechanisms (e.g., safety plan use, coping behavior, self-efficacy) and distal
outcomes (suicidal ideation). With potential for high public health impact, this proposal addresses a critical
need for effective and scalable continuity of care during the high-risk post-ED period to improve suicide-related
outcomes. The impact of the proposed intervention will be strengthened by stakeholder input to inform future
implementation, and tailored remote delivery that can be integrated with existing health system technologies."

A variety of gene therapy strategies have been developed to achieve HIV cure. These strategies include genetic
methods to render immune cells resistant to infection or to enhance immune effector cell anti-HIV activity. In this
latter instance, genetic engineering of B cells has provided a highly novel means to achieve vectored
immunotherapy for production of broadly neutralizing anti-HIV antibodies (bnAbs). Of note, the exceptional
utilities of gene editing have been successfully employed to achieve precision genome modification of B cells to
accomplish this technical end. In this approach, primary mature B cells from the periphery are modified to express
HIV bnAbs as functional antigen receptors spliced to cell endogenous heavy chain constant genes. These cells
are then expanded and affinity-matured, using vaccines or viral antigen in vivo, resulting in the elicitation of
durable, self-tolerant, and isotyped-switched broadly neutralizing antibodies and memory. Here-to-fore this
promising B cell approach has mandated ex vivo genetic modification to practically accomplish effective cell
engineering. This facet of the strategy thereby entrains technical and methodological complexities practically
limiting this approach. Clearly, the ability to accomplish genetic modification of B cells in vivo would render this
approach of greater applicability and accessibility. Further to this end, the ability to achieve such in vivo B cell
transduction, in an efficient and selective manner, would be key to realizing the benefits of this technology with
an acceptable margin of safety. To this end, we have explored the utilities of replication defective adenoviral
vectors (Ad) to address the mandates for in vivo transduction of B cells. In this regard, we have developed a
novel “triple targeting” approach that allows efficient and selective gene delivery to key target cells in vivo. In
addition, adenovirus provides a unique framework for effective and economical in vivo delivery of CRISPR/Cas9
and donor DNA for targeted integration of bnAb genes into the B cell genome by homology directed repair in
situ. Of additional note, the use of non-human primate Ads allows derivation of vectors that can traverse immune
barriers to human adenovirus-based vectors. In the aggregate, these combined facets of adenovirus provide the
critical functional capacities allowing us to address the mandates of an in vivo applied anti-HIV B cell vectored
immunotherapy strategy."

 Sperm have a remarkable and still unexplained capacity to survive for extended periods in the oviduct, contrary to the
strong innate immune response they elicit in the uterus. Following mating, when semen reaches the uterus, sperm interact
with uterine epithelial cells to stimulate an inflammatory reaction. The release of pro-inflammatory cytokines induces a
rapid infiltration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) into the uterus. PMNs then release neutrophil extracellular
traps and phagocytose the majority of sperm. The few sperm that evade phagocytosis in the uterus move to the oviduct
where, in stark contrast, they do not trigger a phagocytic response and can survive for extended periods ranging from
hours to months, depending on the species. Indeed, in the isthmic region of the oviduct (nearest to the uterus), the
presence of macrophages or neutrophils is rare. The oviduct demonstrates unique immunological privilege within the
female reproductive system that enables remaining sperm to avoid elimination by phagocytes. The mechanisms
underlying the different responses between the oviduct and the uterus are unknown. But the ability of sperm to survive
and evade phagocytosis in the oviduct is critical for fertility. Sperm are coated with sialic acid-terminating glycans
(sialoglycans) and changes in sialylation influence the ability of sperm to evade phagocytosis of uterine macrophages.
Sialoglycans can interact with several proteins, including Siglecs (sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-type lectins), the
most abundant and best-known receptors for sialoglycans. There are many different Siglec proteins, found most
commonly on leukocytes, and they are known for their ability to activate or inhibit the immune system, attract immune
cells, and facilitate cell adhesion. However, Siglecs have also recently been localized to non-immune cells such as kidney
and prostate epithelium and uterine and cervical epithelium. Using endpoint PCR, we discovered for the first time that 8
Siglecs are expressed in oviduct epithelium (porcine) and expression is biased towards Siglecs that inhibit the immune
response. We also found that porcine sperm contain sialylated glycans that are high-preference Siglec ligands. These
results led to our overall hypothesis that sperm sialoglycan binding to oviduct Siglecs alters cytokine production
through Siglec-downstream signaling. This inhibits the innate immune response, allowing sperm to avoid immune
rejection and phagocytosis during the storage period in the oviduct. To test this model using in vivo and in vitro
studies, we will determine the role of Siglecs in the oviduct response to sperm by removing sperm sialic acid and blocking
individual Siglecs to determine if oviduct cell gene expression, including the production of immune mediators, and
chemotaxis is affected. We will determine if sperm interaction with oviduct cells is dependent on direct sialoglycan-Siglec
binding. Finally, we will compare Siglec and intracellular signaling protein abundance and localization in the oviduct and
uterus to investigate if that is responsible for the different innate immune responses of both organs to sperm. Collectively,
these Aims will elucidate the role of oviduct Siglecs and sperm sialoglycans in suppressing the immune response in the
oviduct, despite sperm being foreign cells that are largely phagocytosed in the uterus. The results may be used to enhance
sperm lifespan in the oviduct and perhaps develop therapies for infertile females."

 This project aims to understand the basic molecular mechanisms of Hedgehog (Hh) signal
transduction in Drosophila. Hh proteins are prominent members of the limited set of extracellular signaling
molecules responsible for directing development and regulating stem cell activity in Drosophila and in
humans. Consequently, genetic alterations to Hh signaling underlie many developmental disorders and
many types of cancer. Pioneering studies in Drosophila identified the central Hh signaling pathway
components, which were later found to be highly conserved in mammals. Those advances led to much
improved diagnosis of several human syndromes and diseases, and to the development of very promising
anti-cancer drugs that target Smoothened (Smo), a key membrane protein that initiates Hh signal
transduction. The Hh pathway culminates in altering patterns of gene transcription by modifying the activity
of the conserved transcription factors, Ci (in flies) and Gli1-3 (in mammals). Deciphering the mechanisms
that connect Smo to Ci/Gli activation is critical to understand Hh signaling and for the development of drugs
that directly target Ci/Gli activity. Such drugs would potentially counter or restore pathway activation
perturbed by any type of mutation.
 Hh signaling is extremely sensitive to the stoichiometry of signal transduction components and must
therefore be studied under normal physiological conditions. Drosophila offers the most rapid and incisive
molecular genetic approaches to accomplish this. New insights can then be applied rapidly to Hh signaling
in humans and other mammals because the components and mechanisms involved are highly conserved.
Hh regulates Ci in two ways. Hh blocks proteolytic processing of full-length Ci (Ci-155) to a transcriptional
repressor and it activates Ci-155, opposing inhibition by a direct binding partner, Suppressor of fused
(Su(fu)). The mechanism of Ci or Gli activation is largely unknown, but the protein kinase, Fused (Fu), has a
central role in Drosophila. We aim to understand how Su(fu) restrains Ci-155 activity and how Fu kinase
overcomes this inhibition. Our studies will use extensive resources generated by prior studies: a large set of
CRISPR-derived designer ci alleles, stocks that additionally permit simultaneous genetic alteration of one or
more interacting signal transduction proteins and knowledge of Fu target sites of uncertain functional
importance. We expect to define relevant Fu sites, investigate indications that Hh promotes a transition from
an inactive to an active Ci-Su(fu) complex, and explore whether these regulatory transitions can be
reproduced by relevant domains of mammalian proteins in Drosophila."
10809873,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Our recent publications described pathogenic effects of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa type III secretion
system effector ExoU on caspase-1 regulated inflammation. Our new preliminary data indicate that ExoU
bypasses the inflammasome to induce a non-canonical form of caspase-1 activation in lung endothelial cells.
However, the mechanisms underlying ExoU-directed caspase-1 activation are unknown. The consequences of
ExoU-directed caspase-1 activation on a form of cell death known as pyroptosis are also undefined.
 ExoU is a phospholipase A2 (PLA2) that directly interacts with the host cell plasmalemmal membrane to
induce lysis. We have discovered that ExoU also activates an indirect lysis pathway involving the gasdermin D
(GSDMD) executioner of pyroptosis. Together, the data raise the intriguing prospect that ExoU-induced cell
damage involves a combination of direct (ExoU PLA2 activity) and indirect (GSDMD-mediated) lysis pathways.
The ExoU-induced indirect lysis pathway represents a novel virulence mechanism that contributes to P.
aeruginosa pathogenesis. Based on our published and preliminary data, two complementary Specific Aims will
test the Hypothesis that ExoU elicits non-canonical caspase-1 activation and processing of GSDMD to
incite lung endothelial cell pyroptosis during P. aeruginosa infection.
 Aim 1 will elucidate mechanisms underlying ExoU-induced caspase-1 activation. Proposed experiments will
determine whether: 1) ExoU PLA2 increases cytosolic Ca++ to stimulate calpain protease activation and 2) ExoU-
mediated calpain activation liberates caspase-1 from the cytoskeleton to induce auto-activation.
 Aim 2 will examine the role of ExoU in GSDMD activation by: 1) rigorously validating the role of GSDMD in
the ExoU indirect lysis pathway and 2) determining the role of ExoU PLA2 activity in GSDMD activation.
 The studies proposed herein are highly significant. P. aeruginosa is the most frequent Gram-negative,
opportunistic pathogen causing pneumonia in patients with chronic lung disease (e.g., chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis), older age, and/or immunocompromised status. P. aeruginosa is also
prevalent in critically ill patients with respiratory failure in the intensive care unit. Importantly, ExoU-expressing
strains associate with the highest levels of patient morbidity and mortality. Thus, combined therapies targeting
both ExoU and caspase-1 represent a pharmacological strategy to treat the most severe cases of P. aeruginosa
induced pneumonia, acute lung injury, and sepsis. Moreover, the discovery that ExoU induces non-canonical
caspase-1 and GSDMD activation, which drives lung cell death and dysfunction during P. aeruginosa infection
is conceptually innovative. Our proposed studies will use technically innovative gene editing and inducible
expression technologies to demonstrate cause-and-effect relationships between ExoU PLA2 activity, caspase-
1, and GSDMD towards testing our hypothesis."

The correct implementation of developmental programs depends on information encoded in an organism’s
DNA. Despite decades of work in dissecting the spatial control of gene expression in embryonic development,
we know relatively little about the temporal control of these programs—largely due to reliance on dead, fixed
tissues. Recently, our lab established new technologies for real-time measurements of input transcription factor
concentration dynamics and output transcriptional activity in single cells of the early embryo of the fruit fly
Drosophila melanogaster. These measurements have revealed that the transcriptional activity of individual
genes is not constant in time; rather, bursts of gene expression arise when promoters transition between ON
and OFF states.
Transcriptional bursting in eukaryotes, particularly in developmental genes, is ubiquitous; most transcription
factors control mRNA levels by modulating bursting frequency, duration or amplitude, or some combination
thereof. Critically, while we have uncovered which bursting parameters transcription factors modulate to dictate
transcriptional dynamics, we remain ignorant about how this control is implemented at the molecular level.
Here, we propose to make progress toward uncovering the molecular mechanisms by which the Dorsal
activator controls transcriptional bursting in the early embryo of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. We will
combine our cutting-edge imaging and computational technologies for simultaneously measuring Dorsal
concentration dynamics and the instantaneous state of its target promoters (ON or OFF) in individual nuclei of
living embryos. Specifically, we will (1) use our novel compound-state Hidden Markov model to determine
whether Dorsal controls burst size, frequency, amplitude, or some combination thereof, in order to generate
hypotheses about the mechanisms of action of this activator, (2) determine whether stable clusters of high
Dorsal concentration that we recently discovered play an active role in regulating transcriptional dynamics, and
(3) use cutting-edge lattice light-sheet and adaptive optics microscopy to detect functional Dorsal binding
events at snail and determine how this binding triggers the cascade of biochemical events that leads to the
initiation and maintenance of transcription.
Overall, our proposed work will establish a clear workflow for the in vivo dissection of the molecular
mechanisms of transcriptional control in development. This approach is amenable to implementation in other
genes in the fruit fly as well as in other workhorses of developmental biology. We envision that our mechanistic
insights will make it possible to derive theoretical models of developmental decision-making that will empower
future synthetic applications as well as reengineering of multicellular organisms, for example to fix
developmental defects or to halt states of unchecked cellular proliferation in cancer."

Impaired emotion regulation (ER) is a risk factor for a wide range of neuropsychiatric conditions and safeguarding
its development could have important implications on mental health. Pre-pregnancy obesity has long been
associated with indicators of impaired ER in children – e.g., elevated mood symptoms, increased negative
emotional intensity, and increased rates of psychiatric disorders with ER deficits such as depressive and anxiety
disorders. Despite these well documented associations, mechanistic studies in humans that link pre-pregnancy
obesity with offspring ER development are scarce. Our proposal aims to address this research gap. We will
examine the overarching hypothesis that pre-pregnancy maternal obesity negatively influences offspring ER
development through its effects on the maternal gut microbiome and metabolome. Our innovative design
includes longitudinal assessments of the maternal microbiome and metabolome, repeated assessments of ER-
related brain systems in the offspring using fetal and infant MRI scans, and behavioral assays of ER in the
offspring through the first 24 months of life. Using these multimodal assessments and longitudinal design, we
will test whether (a) the maternal gut microbiome during gestation is influenced by maternal obesity; (b) the
maternal gut microbiome is associated with maternal metabolites within tryptophan and tyrosine metabolic
pathways; and (c) maternal metabolites in turn correlate with ER development measured with brain (fetal and
infant MRI) and behavioral correlates. Our study is uniquely positioned to address these aims leveraging an
ongoing human birth cohort study (HOPE cohort, supported by Duke University) of mother-infant dyads enriched
for obesity (50% of enrollees with pre-pregnancy BMI>=30, confirmed by medical record). The HOPE cohort
includes an extensive battery of biospecimens and clinical/demographic measures with pregnant women
enrolled during the first trimester gestation and their children followed into the first few years of life. With over 1
million children born yearly in the US to mothers who experienced pre-pregnancy obesity, the ER developmental
impact of pre-pregnancy obesity is a substantial and mounting concern – and disproportionately impacts low
income and minoritized populations. Mechanistic research in humans that links pre-pregnancy obesity with
offspring ER development and psychiatric risk is critical to advancing prevention efforts."
10935975,"Cerebrovascular injuries, including overt stroke, silent cerebral infarction involving diffused white matter neuroaxonal lesions are integrated within the pathogenesis of vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). A significant disease burden in sickle cell disease (SCD) includes cognitive decline affecting >50% of the adult patients impacting memory and executive functioning primarily associated with white matter hyperintensities. Occlusions of the cerebral microvessels due to sickle hemoglobin polymerization results in hypoxia and subsequent reoxygenation (H/R) leading to ischemic tissue damage. The present proposal, set to determine the mechanistic link between H/R within the cerebrovascular space and the white matter hyperintensities instigating VCID in SCD setting, thus create a prototype to fill the knowledge gap in the pathogenesis of VCID. Using a preclinical mouse model of SCD, we found that microstructural white matter hyperintensities, identified by magnetic resonance imaging-based diffusion tensor imaging and histopathology are substantially abundant in sickle (SS) mice compared to normal (AA) mice. The white matter hyperintensities in the SS mice were associated with cognitive decline and activation of astrocytes, the modified glial cells connecting cerebral microvasculature and the neurons. Frataxin (FXN), a mitochondrial protein responsible for iron-sulfer clustering, regulates astrocyte function and is associated with neurodegeneration in Friedreich’s ataxia. Our pilot data showed that expression of FXN is reduced in the astrocytes concomitant with an increase in hypoxia inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a), a homeostatic regulatory transcription factor that is elevated during H/R events. The overarching scientific hypothesis is that elevated HIF-1a inhibits astrocytic frataxin and promotes white matter injury and VCID in SCD. In Aim 1, we will be performing diffusion tensor imaging and immunofluorescence experiments to assess microstructural damage, neuronal calcium accumulation and astrocyte activation in H/R-challenged SS and AA mice. Using bone marrow trasplantation (BMT), we will be assessing the role of FXN in the development of white matter injury and cognitive impairment following H/R injury in the sickle chimera mice lacking expression of astrocytic FXN. In Aim 2, a sickle chimera mice with targeted deletion of HIF-1a in the astrocytes will be generated using BMT. The new sickle chimera mice will be used to determine whether HIF-1a is critical for inhibition of FXN promoting white matter injury and cognitive decline. Successful completion of the study will identify FXN as a promising therapeutic target for white matter protection that may help provide resilience against VCID. Since underlying inflammation and ischemia often accelerate age-related pathophysiology in SCD, this study will lay the foundation to identify the causal link between ischemia and astrocyte function in the pathogenesis of progressive VCID, which also has the potential to generalize beyond VCID in SCD to common mixed dementias such as clinical Alzheimer’s disease."

In neuronal excitation-transcription (E-T) coupling, electrical signals at somatodendritic membranes drive
transcriptional activation in the nucleus, tens or hundreds of micrometers away. E-T coupling is critical for long-
term adaptation, synaptic plasticity, development and memory; it can go awry in brain disorders. Voltage-gated
L-type Ca2+ channels (LTCCs) play a dominant role in E-T coupling. Switching on these Ca2+ channels initiates
a cascade that causes activation of a nuclear transcription factor CREB (Ca2+- and cAMP- response element
binding protein), heavily studied because of its importance for learning and memory. This proposal concerns
signaling mechanisms that connect activation of LTCCs to CREB phosphorylation and other nuclear events.
We recently found that excitatory neurons use two distinct signals to mediate E-T coupling: a local rise in Ca2+
and a voltage-dependent conformational change (VΔC) of the LTCC, akin to the VΔC that triggers contraction
of skeletal muscle. Even with LTCC Ca2+ influx blocked, VΔC synergistically augmented CaMKII mobilization to
dendritic spines initiated by NMDA receptor stimulation and greatly enhanced the phospho-CREB response.
Such cooperation between glutamatergic input (NMDAR) and electrical signaling (VΔC) operates like a
temporal proximity detector, of likely significance for synaptic plasticity. We will address new questions about
mechanistic components, impact on synaptic and molecular dynamics, and signaling from neuronal
subregions. First, we will make designer L-type channels to determine how Ca2+ channelCaMKII
communication comes about. Second, we will test a mechanstic model for the multiple steps between CaMKII
liberation and mobilization to synaptic sites, its dwell at NMDARs and its eventual conformation-sensitive LTCC
trapping. Third, we will delineate the potency of local subregions to control nuclear transcription and gauge the
impact of synaptic L-type channelCaMKII signaling on immediate and 24 h changes in synaptic strength, of
relevance to multiple brain disorders, including neuropsychiatric diseases and Alzheimer’s disease."
10827427,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Multidrug resistant (MDR) infections caused by the bacterial pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii are increasing
at alarming rates. Currently, over 60 % of global A. baumannii clinical isolates are MDR, leading the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization to categorize it as a top priority for the
research and development of new antimicrobial therapies. In addition to accumulating resistance mechanisms,
A. baumannii strains develop tolerance to antibiotics, which can frequently lead to poor therapeutic outcomes
even with antibiotic susceptible strains. However, the mechanisms used by A. baumannii to adapt to and tolerate
hostile conditions remain largely unknown. We found that A. baumannii employs a novel stress response
pathway in which phenylacetic acid (PAA), a metabolite derived from phenylalanine catabolism, acts as a
signaling molecule. We established that, in the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of different antibiotics,
such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, A. baumannii dramatically increases the transcription of the paa operon
which encodes enzymes required to degrade PAA. Conversely, other conditions, like hydrogen peroxide
treatment, lead to a repression of the paa operon. The regulation of the paa operon triggers a physiological
adaptive response that includes the modulation of pili biosynthesis and biofilm formation. Importantly, we found
that artificial augmentation of PAA levels, through the addition of commercially available PAA-derivatives or
mutations in PAA degradative genes, disrupts this response Furthermore, mutating initial steps of PAA
degradation leads to increased sensitivity to antibiotics and oxidative stress in multiple strains. Here we propose
to use our expertise in A. baumannii genetics and pathogenesis to investigate the PAA-mediated stress response
in Acinetobacter and determine its importance in virulence. We will determine the breadth of PAA signaling using
reporter assays, and we will explore PAA-mediated changes in cell physiology by profiling gene expression
under different stress conditions. Further, we will characterize the PAA-dependent mechanisms of cell signaling
under stress by measuring cellular levels of PAA and determining the role of important regulatory proteins in this
cascade. Finally, we will test the virulence of strains unable to regulate PAA levels in the catheter-associated
urinary tract infection and lung infection murine models. Our work will establish the role of PAA as a key
regulatory molecule in A. baumannii, determine the biological processes regulated by PAA, and uncover the
mechanisms by which PAA triggers adaptations to promote survival under stress. Understanding the
fundamental aspects of the PAA stress response will provide a foundation to future clinical studies."
10809611,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a debilitating muscle disease that remains without an effective
treatment despite the accumulated knowledge about the causative gene and muscle pathogenesis. Several
clinical trials have failed partly because of a lack of reliable and sensitive outcome measures to assess disease
progression and changes in disease course in response to an intervention. Current outcome measures such as
timed physical tests and forced vital capacity (FVC) are laborious and often less objective than ideal, and
moreover not sufficiently sensitive to detect meaningful short-term changes. We hypothesize that blood
accessible biomarkers provide useful tools as surrogate outcome measures to monitor disease course and
early changes in disease direction in DMD. Highly specific, precise, and reproducible analytical assays are
needed to identify such biomarkers. We have extensively published on biomarker discoveries in DMD using
SomaScan aptamer-based assay and mass spectrometry. The next step is to further develop and test
biomarkers for their clinical utility. The goal of this R61/R33 proposal is to use a rigorous workflow to evaluate
monitoring biomarker signatures that could be translated from bench to clinic and bench to clinical trials to help
with drug development programs. We have generated strong preliminary data that support our hypothesis and
feasibility. For the R61 phase, we propose two aims. Specific Aim 1 is to develop reliable, specific, and
accurate methods for discovery and measurement of serum protein biomarkers in DMD. Specific Aim 2 is to
define optimal monitoring biomarker signatures with robust statistical methods using longitudinal serum
samples with clinical data collected from well-defined and well annotated cohorts. Specific Aim 3 is to carry out
an evaluation of the developed monitoring biomarker signatures in external independent samples
(retrospective or prospective) using longitudinal sera samples and clinical data collected through independent
cohorts. If successful, this proposal will provide proof of concept of monitoring biomarker signatures for DMD to
help with go/no-go decision making in future short term clinical trials or in day to day clinical usage by a
physician to judge disease burden and severity, i.e., sensitive to short-term changes in function and predictive
of longer-term disease milestones."

The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is
seeking proposals for collaborative research and convening activities to advance and promote regulatory science
in several key areas prioritized by the FDA, the pharmaceutical industry, and Congress in 2022’s Prescription
Drug User Fee Act VII (PDUFA VII) and Biosimilar User Fee Act (BsUFA III). Building on more than fourteen
years of collaborative working experience with the FDA on priority topics, the Duke-Robert J. Margolis, MD,
Center for Health Policy (Duke-Margolis) proposes to continue collaborating with the FDA to tackle the range of
policy, scientific, and operational challenges identified in PDUFA VII and BsUFA III.
Duke-Margolis will build on its past experience to work collaboratively with FDA to identify priority topics for
development and delivery of up to nine collaborative research and convening activities that include the annual
completion of up to four large public conferences, two private expert workshops, and three other convening
activities (e.g., think tanks, webinars) as needed and achievable under the annual budget. Depending on the
intended convening purpose or need, convenings may be virtual, hybrid, or in-person. Through this new
cooperative agreement, and in keeping with goals in PDUFA VII and BsUFA III to expedite development through
trusted science, Duke-Margolis proposes to expand on our existing infrastructure, extensive stakeholder
relationships, convening experience and expertise, and positive track record of collaboration with numerous FDA
Centers and Offices to achieve the following aims:
Specific Aim 1: Implement a multidisciplinary, multi-stakeholder, and collaborative research and convening
program to support FDA and its stakeholders in addressing complex drug development and regulatory review
challenges as outlined in PDUFA VII and BsUFA III.
Specific Aim 2: Synthesize and distill the core background research, stakeholder input, and workshop or meeting
discussions pursued in Aim 1 to promote and establish concrete, actionable next steps and recommendations
for all stakeholder groups.
Specific Aim 3: Disseminate the findings and recommendations developed under Aim 2 to the public in a
transparent and timely method, with an eye toward continually engaging stakeholders to further refine and
implement key concepts and recommendations where feasible and appropriate.
Duke-Margolis is uniquely suited to collaborate with the FDA to advance research in the key areas identified in
PDUFA VII and BsUFA III. We seek to build on our senior team’s fourteen years of experience working
collaboratively with the FDA through other such cooperative agreements to engage stakeholders on high-
priority questions of interest, develop recommendations and models for making progress, and advance
regulatory science and more efficient development of safe and effective drugs for patients in need."
10807653,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is incurable, the 2nd most common blood cancer, and most common cancer
that affects bone. It occurs preferentially in elderly, males, and African Americans. Agent Orange and toxic agents
used in Vietnam and Gulf Wars increase MM risk. Thus, MM incidence is rapidly rising among veterans. MM
cells interact with the bone niche to activate osteoclasts and inhibit osteoblasts, leading to skeletal destruction
that seldom heals even in remission. The bone niche protects MM cells against treatment, leading to future
relapses and incurability. Current treatments provide temporary disease control with inadequate new bone
formation. Patients suffer from chronic bone pain and require long-term treatment with new choices needed at
relapse. MM takes a major toll on the health of veterans and is a heavy financial burden on the VA system.
 Proteasome inhibitors (PIs) such as bortezomib (Btz) are the mainstay of MM therapy. They are the only
drug class with bone anabolic effects, but their benefit is transient. We propose to increase PI efficacy by
combining them with a sphingolipid-modulating drug, fingolimod, already FDA-approved for multiple sclerosis.
Our data show that fingolimod dramatically increases efficacy of bortezomib both to inhibit tumors and stimulate
bone formation in mouse xenograft models of human MM. The dual efficacy was seen with MM cells growing
within bone marrow and as subcutaneous plasmacytoma. In both models, there was a significant new trabecular
bone formation in the lumbar spine distant from tumor cells. The combination also inhibited the growth of MM
cells isolated from Btz-refractory patients in ex vivo co-cultures. Repurposing the approved drug fingolimod and
new analogs (Imods) is particularly attractive since they are safe for long-term use, conveniently available as
pills, and can be rapidly and cheaply tested in clinical trials. Both Btz and fingolimod have FDA-approved analogs
with higher specificity and better safety profiles. Our goal is a phase I/II clinical trial of PI + Imods in relapsed
MM within 5 years. The present grant is designed to provide necessary preclinical data to support this trial.
 Aim 1 will test combinations of second-generation fingolimod analogs (siponimod, ozanimod, and
ponesimod) and PI, carfilzomib, and compare to Btz + fingolimod. Three models will be used: subcutaneous
and intravenous xenografts of human MM cell lines with different genetic risk factors, and a mouse model with
an intact immune system. The models will be characterized in detail for a reduction in tumor burden and
preservation/stimulation of bone formation. The most promising combination will be further tested in Aim 3 using
primary MM samples. Aim 2 will investigate the mechanism of action of combination at concentrations
achievable in patients. Fingolimod and other Imods may have indirect effects via the tumor niche or alter
concentrations of systemic endocrine factors. We will test fingolimod effects on bone cells and endothelial cells,
and assay for endocrine factors that may play a role in its anti-tumor effect both within and outside of the bone.
Imods are immune modulators in multiple sclerosis, so we will test whether it has an additional antitumor action
against MM in a syngeneic mouse model with an intact immune system. We will also test whether combination
treatment postpones or prevents recurrence and heals bone lesions in xenografts following initial treatment. This
aim will define important markers that can be analyzed in Aim 3 and further validated in clinical trials. The
mechanisms may further identify sphingolipid targets to be specifically targeted. Aim 3 will interrogate gene
sequence databases to identify sphingolipid signatures that impact outcomes and validate them using our local
tissue bank of primary MM cells and bone niche cells for SL signature and sensitivity to the combination in ex
vivo co-culture models (EVOCA), which we have developed. To support the planned trial, bone marrow samples
will be collected prospectively from 60 veterans with newly diagnosed myeloma, and their responses to treatment
correlated with the expression of identified gene markers. Primary cells from MM patients will also be tested for
sensitivity to the combination in EVOCA and PDX xenograft models."
10810306,"PROJECT SUMMARY
SHIV-infected rhesus macaques (RMs) develop HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) via Env-antibody
(Ab) co-evolutionary pathways that recapitulate events in HIV-1 infected humans. This includes the frequency of
bNAb induction, the viral epitopes targeted, and the immunogenetic and structural features of bNAbs, which are
all similar in RMs and humans. Thus, we hypothesize that SHIV-infected RMs can serve as a guide for HIV-1
immunogen design, allowing for an iterative analysis of Env-Ab coevolution and the design of lineage-based
immunogens in a way not previously possible. There are three main hurdles to inducing bNAbs in monkeys and
humans: (i) efficient priming of rare HIV bNAb germline (GL) B cells; (ii) immunofocused boosting of B cell
responses targeting conserved bNAb epitopes and away from off-target epitopes; and (iii) affinity-guided,
antigen-driven maturation of B cell lineages. We hypothesize that we can find solutions to all of these inter-
related challenges by using the SHIV animal model to guide the design of new priming and boosting immunogens
that target V3 glycan and CD4 binding site (CD4bs) bNAb epitopes. Specifically, we will work with the Bjorkman
laboratory and Core A to incorporate selective glycan deletions and other GL-targeted mutations into our SHIV
designs to immunofocus early B cell responses to the V3 glycan and CD4bs bNAb epitopes. We will also develop
lineage-maturing SHIVs designed to boost bNAb responses that are primed by GL-targeted Env trimer
nanoparticles or mRNA-LNPs vaccines and then allow the natural process of Env-Ab coevolution in the setting
of an evolving SHIV quasispecies to affinity-mature the primed bNAb lineages to neutralization breath. In both
instances, we will decipher SHIV Env-Ab co-evolution where, unlike in humans, we can analyze multiple animals
infected by the same SHIVs and identify maturation pathways that are shared among different outbred animals.
We hypothesize that such analyses, when combined with work by the Bjorkman and Nussenzweig laboratories,
can provide a “blueprint” for lineage-based immunogens by identifying key Env variants that bind bNAb
precursors and intermediate stage antibodies required for affinity maturation. In the last year of the Project, we
will determine the protective capacity of the best lineage-based protein and/or mRNA-LNP immunization regimen
against a heterologous tier 2 SHIV challenge. Throughout these studies, we will work closely with the Bjorkman
and Nussenzweig laboratories to assess the impact of antibody feedback on bNAb development in both
vaccinated and SHIV-infected RMs."
10810307,"Project Summary
Despite AIDS being a preventable disease, UNAIDS reports millions of newly HIV-1 infected people every
year. An efficacious vaccine for HIV-1 is therefore highly sought after. Despite many efforts, attempts to create
immunization regimens that reproducibly elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against HIV-1 have
failed thus far. The field has focused on developing a sequential immunization strategies that through priming
with immunogens that activate germline bNAb precursor B cells, followed by boosts with increasingly more
native Env based-immunogens, shepherds these germline precursors through somatic hypermutation in the
germinal center to the develop into mature bNAbs-expessing cells. Whereas priming immunogens now exist
that can reliably activate the correct bNAb precursor B cells, the immune response over the course of
sequential immunization regimens becomes increasingly less focused on target epitopes and non-neutralizing
off-target responses start to dominate the antibody response over time. To aid the design of better boosting
immunogens by the Bjorkman and Hahn/Shaw labs, the Nussenzweig lab will conduct experiments in wt and
transgenic mice to identify better boosting immunogens and dissect mechanisms that lead to off-target epitope
responses in sequential immunization. Recent experiments from the Nussenzweig lab indicate that antibody
feedback and the quality and quantity of the T follicular helper cell response affect recruitment and affinity
maturation of germinal center (GC) B cell. Passively infused monoclonal antibodies in immunologically intact
mice and humans indicated that antibody feedback resulted in the emergence of more off-target responses by
masking target epitopes. Moreover, memory B cells emerging from such GCs are selected by a mechanism
favoring antibody repertoire diversity over affinity8,11. HIV-1 immunogens designed by the Bjorkman lab will be
used by the Nussenzweig lab to explore how polyclonal antibody responses alter the outcome of sequential
immunization with the aim to improve on-target responses during boosting. The concepts that will be
delineated from these experiments will then be tested in RM models by the Hahn/Shaw laboratories."
10931738,"Conversations are a critical medium for success in daily life, but predictors and measures of conversational
success are poorly understood. The overarching goal of this proposal is to identify networks of naturalistic
and standardized psycholinguistic features that lead to successful conversations. Standardized language
assessments often do not capture important linguistic processes in real-world conversations, such as pronominal
reference, back-channeling, turn-taking, or phonological, lexical, or syntactic alignment. The double empathy
theory further posits that autistic conversational difficulties reflect failures of mutual understanding, rather than
autistic deficits, indicating that autistic and neurotypical conversation partners differentially use and understand
these linguistic processes. This proposal centers individuals with autism spectrum disorder who have age-
appropriate scores on standardized language measures, many of whom nonetheless struggle with
communication. We will use machine learning to model conversational profiles based on interactional
measures of linguistic processes drawn from spontaneous conversation, and standardized language
assessments, to evaluate conversational success in neurotype-concordant and neurotype-discordant
interactions. Leveraging the ubiquity of videoconferencing, we will collect clinical and psycholinguistic data from
dyadic conversations in a large sample of 500 12–15-year-old adolescents. We will also collect in-person
conversational data from a group of n = 60. After providing a canonical speech sample, participants will have
conversations with neurotype-concordant and -discordant partners in two contexts: (1) a get to know you
conversation, and (2) a collaborative conversation, in which partners each hold one of a pair of pictures that
differs in five ways and verbally collaborate to find the differences. We objectively define conversational success
as the number and speed of correct identifications in Task 2. In addition, partners will rate their interactions post-
hoc on subjective social metrics (e.g., likeability, warmth, boredom) and conversational success metrics (e.g.,
turn-taking, mutual appreciation, interest in further interaction). Conversations and speech samples will be
recorded and then scored by naïve third-party raters on the same metrics. Recordings will be analyzed for
acoustic, psycholinguistic, and conversational measures (e.g., fundamental frequency, prosodic range, pause
duration, linguistic alignment, turn-taking). We will contrast the power of standardized scores and naturalistic
psycholinguistic measures to predict both subjectively and objectively defined conversational success (Aim 1)
and compare success in neurotype-concordant and neurotype-discordant partnerships (Aim 2). Aim 3 will
leverage this rich dataset of acoustic, linguistic, perceptual, and standardized data to model computational
predictor networks of conversational success. Results will advance the field by establishing metrics of
conversational success in real-world social interactions and using computational models to form meaningful
conversational profile clusters that go beyond simple diagnostic dichotomies to inform personalized supports."
10807470,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most common cause of preventable vision loss in the U.S. and disproportionately
affects minorities and people with limited socioeconomic resources. Prompt diagnosis and treatment can prevent
visual impairment by up to 90%, making adherence to visits critical. The Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) is a
validated measure which has demonstrated the effects of neighborhood-level vulnerability on individual patient
access and outcomes. Increased neighborhood-level social vulnerability, measured using SVI, is associated with
increased risk of missed ophthalmology appointments. As SVI is being integrated into electronic health records,
there is now an opportunity to systematically identify individuals with high neighborhood SVI who are at increased
risk of missed appointments and subsequent vision loss. Dr. Scanzera previously identified transportation to and
from visits to be among the most consistent markers of social vulnerability that contributes to missed
appointments in patients residing in neighborhoods with high social vulnerability. The purpose of Dr. Scanzera’s
K23 research plan is to design, implement, and evaluate a ride-share transportation intervention adapted from
her health system’s existing PROgram for Non-emergency TranspOrtation (PRONTO) to mitigate barriers to
adhering to scheduled ophthalmology visits in patients with DR coming from neighborhoods with high social
vulnerability. She plans to integrate implementation science and human-centered design research strategies to
(1) Co-Design and (2) Pilot test PRONTO-EYE, which she hypothesizes will be successfully integrated into the
existing healthcare system and will improve adherence to ophthalmology visits in this population.
Dr. Scanzera’s long-term career goal is to develop and implement evidence-based interventions to reduce
preventable blindness in underserved areas in the U.S. The K23 Career Development Award will provide her the
mentored research as well as didactic and experiential training to become an independent investigator using
implementation science to work toward eliminating disparities in eye health. She will have access to considerable
resources through the University of Illinois Chicago, including mentors with expertise that each complement her
research proposal and career development. This K23 proposal directly aligns with the National Institutes of
Health commitment to ending structural racism by 1) improving minority health and reducing health disparities,
and 2) removing barriers to advancing health disparities research. Additionally, the National Eye Institute’s 2021
Strategic Plan includes public health & disparities research as an area of emphasis. By developing an
intervention for patients with diabetic retinopathy residing in neighborhoods with high social vulnerability, Dr.
Scanzera’s research plan has the potential to improve access to eye care and eye health outcomes in the
underserved. The immediate deliverable will be a transportation intervention to improve adherence to
ophthalmology visits in patients with diabetic retinopathy residing in neighborhoods with high social vulnerability
which will be evaluated in a subsequent larger trial as part of an R01."
10807473,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Increasing evidence suggests that brain perivascular
spaces play important roles in intracerebral fluid transport and brain homeostasis. Enlarged
perivascular spaces (PVS) have reported associations with aging, mild cognitive impairment
(MCI), and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the utility of this biomarker as an imaging
predictor of AD is not fully known. To advance progress in AD, early disease biomarkers must be
developed. PVS are linked with biological changes that occur early during the course of AD,
including dysfunctional intracerebral fluid regulation, neuroinflammation, and small vessel
disease. Yet, substantial gaps in knowledge persist with regard to optimal methods of PVS
detection and quantitation in live humans. To advance knowledge on PVS effects in humans, a
harmonized, non-biased, and time-efficient technique of PVS quantification must be employed in
diseased cohorts. In this project, an open-source automated Frangi filter technique of PVS
detection will be used to detect PVS and assess their associations with AD in a large, well
characterized, underserved Appalachian community cohort. PVS will be analyzed globally and in
specific brain regions in aging, MCI, and AD and PVS longitudinal changes will be examined. This
work will leverage a rich resource of existing clinical and imaging material available from the
Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute Memory Health Clinic and will produce novel data pertaining
to PVS metrics. The hypothesis is that PVS serve as a predictor for AD. In Aim 1, we will examine
the associations of static PVS metrics with a diagnosis of AD and cognitive decline. In Aim 2, we
will examine the associations of longitudinal PVS metrics with a diagnosis of AD and cognitive
decline. In both aims, we will investigate how relationships of PVS metrics differ by age, sex,
education history, and comorbid diseases. Overall, these studies have the potential to uncover
new knowledge regarding optimal methods of PVS measurement, interpretation, and detection in
persons at risk of developing AD. This project may reveal new diagnostic and prognostic factors
for AD while elucidating appropriate methods for studying PVS in the setting of other age-related
neurological conditions."
10810709,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We will develop novel computer vision tools to reliably and precisely measure nonverbal social
communication through quantifying communicative facial and bodily expressions. Our tools will be
designed and developed in order to maximize their usability by non-engineer behavioral scientists, filling the
enormous gap between engineering advances and their clinical accessibility. Significance: Social interaction
inherently relies on perception and production of coordinated face and body expressions. Indeed, atypical face
and body movements are observed in many disorders, impacting social interaction and communication.
Traditional systems for quantifying nonverbal communication (e.g., FACS, BAP) require extensive training and
coding time. Their tedious coding requirements drastically limits their scalability and reproducibility. While an
extensive literature exists on advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques for face and body
analysis, there is no well-established method commonly used in mental health community to quantify production
of facial and bodily expressions or efficiently capture individual differences in nonverbal communication in
general. As a part of this proposal, we will develop a computer vision toolbox including tools that are both highly
granular and highly scalable, to allow for measurement of complex social behavior in large and heterogeneous
populations. Approach: Our team will develop tools that provide granular metrics of nonverbal social behavior,
including localized face and body kinematics, characteristics of elicited expressions, and imitation performance.
Our tools will facilitate measurement of social communication both within a person and between people, to allow
for assessment of individual social communication cues as well as those that occur within bidirectional social
contexts. Preliminary Data: We have developed and applied novel computer vision tools to assess: (1) diversity
of mouth motion during conversational speech (effect size d=1.0 in differentiating young adults with and without
autism during a brief natural conversation), (2) interpersonal facial coordination (91% accuracy in classifying
autism diagnosis in young adults during a brief natural conversation, replicated in an independent child sample),
and (3) body action imitation (85% accuracy in classifying autism diagnosis based on body imitation
performance). As apart of current proposal, we will develop more generic methods that can be used in normative
and clinical samples. Aims. In Aim 1, we will develop tools to automatically quantify fine-grained face movements
and their coordination during facial expression production; in Aim 2, we will develop tools to quantify body joint
kinematics and their coordination during bodily expression production; in Aim 3, we will demonstrate the tools’
ability to yield dimensional metrics using machine learning. Impact: Our approach is designed for fast and
rigorous assessment of nonverbal social communication, providing a scalable solution to measure individual
variability, within a dimensional and transdiagnostic framework."
10810710,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects 25% of the global population at a substantial burden to the
health care system. Despite significant advances in our understanding of the underlying causes and considerable
efforts in drug development, no pharmacological therapy currently exists for this disease. Accelerated
atherosclerosis, independent of traditional risk factors, is the major cause of death in patients with NAFLD,
particularly in those with the more severe non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Thus, there is an urgent clinical
need to identify new pathways for simultaneous targeting of NASH and atherosclerosis. Imbalanced lipid
metabolism and dysregulated amino acid metabolism are emerging as common features in both NASH and
atherosclerosis, although their crosstalk has not received much attention. Lipidated amino acids or N-acyl amino
acids (NAAs) have emerged as endogenous signaling molecules in which an amide bond links an amino acid to
the acyl moiety of a long-chain fatty acid. Yet, little is known about the metabolic regulation of NAAs, particularly
in cardiometabolic diseases. Our preliminary data uncovered that the liver is a major hub for NAA metabolism.
Unbiased transcriptomics revealed suppression of known NAA biosynthetic genes (GLYAT, ADH7 and PM20D1)
and upregulation of degradative genes (PAM, PTGS1 and PTGS2) in livers from humans and mice with NASH,
concomitant with marked reduction of NAAs, as determined by metabolomics. Hepatic NAAs inversely correlated
with NASH and inflammatory indices. Importantly, chronic administration of N-oleoyl leucine (C18:1-Leu), as
proof-of-concept, protected against diet-induced NASH, independent of changes in systemic energy metabolism.
This was associated with induction of hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα)/fatty acid
oxidation (FAO), suppression of C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) and reduced hepatic macrophages and
fibrosis. In atherosclerotic mice, C18:1-Leu reduced lesional macrophages and atherosclerosis, while
concurrently lowering hepatic steatosis and CCL2. Thus, our findings support the potential of NAAs for the
simultaneous treatment of NASH and atherosclerosis. This project will address the central hypothesis that lipid
overload and ensuing inflammation inhibit hepatic NAA formation, while NAAs stimulate hepatic PPARα and
suppress CCL2, simultaneously reducing NASH and atherosclerosis. Aim 1 will determine the mechanisms
driving suppression of NAAs in NASH and atherosclerosis using in vitro and in vivo models of loss- and gain-of-
function of NAA metabolic genes and will define genetic variants in these genes linking both diseases in GWAS
and human liver samples. Aim 2 will define NAAs as a potential therapy for NASH, thereby atherosclerosis, and
its dependence on PPARα-mediated hepatic FAO and suppression of CCL2 using new liver-specific and dietary
mouse models combined with in vitro approaches. This work will characterize a newly identified metabolic
pathway linking NASH and atherosclerosis and provide mechanistic data to accelerate the development of NAAs
as a simultaneous treatment for these diseases, thus addressing a significant unmet clinical need."
10810809,"ABSTRACT
Research in our laboratory focuses on understanding how the human brain encodes and interprets information
about odor stimuli. Often regarded as the trivial “fifth” sense, the human sense of smell is in fact remarkably
robust. The human nose can discriminate odors with subtle differences in molecular structure, distinguish
thousands of unique smells, and transport us back in time to reactivate distant memories and emotional states.
Additionally, the olfactory system (in human and non-human animals) is an increasingly attractive and powerful
model for studying brain function under normal and pathological conditions.
Studies investigating the human olfactory system have traditionally relied on two types of methods: functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and scalp-based EEG. While these non-invasive approaches have yielded
important insights about odor processing, the scope of testable questions is limited due to temporal (MRI) and
spatial (EEG) constraints. In particular, there is a critical knowledge gap in understanding the physiological
basis of the human sense of smell. Over the last few years, we have had the opportunity to obtain intracranial
EEG (iEEG) recordings from epilepsy patients with medically resistant seizures. As part of a standard surgical
pre-clinical evaluation, patients undergo surgery during which invasive depth electrodes are implanted into the
brain to localize epileptogenic foci. This approach provides an invaluable opportunity to characterize human
olfactory cortical processing with high spatiotemporal resolution. Our recent studies have established that odor
stimuli evoke rhythmic oscillations of 3-7 Hz (“theta” frequency) in human piriform cortex (PC), and that distinct
odors evoke distinct theta activity as soon as 100 ms after the onset of a sniff. We have also shown that theta
phase coupling between PC and hippocampus increases in the presence of odor but not air.
These novel findings provide a platform for experiments outlined here. By leveraging our expertise in olfactory
cognitive neuroscience with state-of-the-art iEEG signal analysis tools, we will establish a physiological
foundation of human olfactory processing at the level of population dynamics and network interactions. Our
proposed studies, informed by data from animal models, are designed to test forward-based, hypothesis-driven
questions about the mechanistic underpinnings of odor perception. Aim 1 will address how changes in
fundamental features of odor stimuli alter PC neural dynamics as assessed by changes in theta oscillatory
features. Aim 2 will test the role of PC-hippocampal coupling in odor discrimination. Aim 3 will examine whether
PC theta plays a causal role in odor perception, and will identify potential mechanisms by which theta can
shape odor processing. The conceptual approaches developed here should help guide future basic and clinical
research strategies for assessing the biological relevance of olfactory oscillations in the human brain."

Access and Individual Results Return on Environmental Exposures to Participant Communities
We seek to expand our Chemicals in Our Bodies (CIOB) pregnancy cohort at University of California, San
Francisco (UCSF) to enhance the diversity of our study population, integrate new individual and neighborhood
level measures of structural racism and social marginalization, expand environmental chemical exposure
measures, report back individual chemical results to participants, and share accessible and actionable
pregnancy cohort data to diverse end-users. CIOB is a diverse pregnancy cohort of Latina, White, Asian, and
Black participants dedicated to understanding how prenatal exposures to endocrine-disrupting chemicals
(EDCs) and social stressors during pregnancy affect perinatal, maternal health, and neurodevelopmental
outcomes in offspring. With 769 participants, the nine-year-old CIOB pregnancy cohort was launched in the
San Francisco Bay Area as part of our NIEHS/US EPA Children’s Environmental Health Center, and continued
recruitment of pregnant participants and extended follow-up of offspring through seven years old in
collaboration with University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign as part of the NIH ECHO program. For this grant,
we will enhance the diversity of CIOB by expanding recruitment of Black (N=80) and other pregnant
participants of color (N=70) from Oakland, CA (Total N=150) from a safety net hospital. We will administer our
established surveys and collect biospecimens to increase our cohort size to ~920 participants and measure
~200 chemicals including phthalates and other plasticizers, phenolic compounds, pesticides, and aromatic
amines. We will integrate new neighborhood measures of structural racism and socioeconomic marginalization
to facilitate analyses of the cumulative and joint effects of chemical and social stressor exposures on perinatal
and maternal health outcomes. We will evaluate the relationship between the multiple chemical exposures and
social stressors and their relationship to adverse pregnancy outcomes. We will also make our cohort data
broadly accessible to other researchers including those who wish to leverage banked biospecimens and
expand analyses of prenatal social and environmental chemical exposures via the Vivli platform, an online data
repository. We will use the smartphone Digital Exposure Report Back Interface (DERBI) to report back to
participants their individual chemical exposure results (with aggregate study results, exposure sources, and
strategies for individual and collective approaches to exposure reduction). Development of DERBI will entail
iterative feedback from our participants via usability testing. Analyses using our CIOB cohort will inform clinical
practice, as well as environmental and social policies and interventions to eliminate the double jeopardy of
environmental chemical and social stressor exposures on perinatal and maternal health."

Advancement of science is enhanced when researchers have diverse backgrounds, talents, and perspectives to
stimulate innovative and creative approaches that address healthcare challenges. The talent, experiences, and
participation of students from underrepresented groups have been demonstrated to be starkly low in science,
technology, and engineering and are worse at the highest levels of educational training (PhD). This project seeks
to establish the U-RISE at Kennesaw State training program to increase the number of underrepresented
students entering doctoral programs in the biomedical sciences. Four objectives have been set to achieve this
goal: (1) recruit five underrepresented biomedical science undergraduates per year for five years into the U-
RISE program; (2) retain at least four U-RISE trainees in biomedical degree programs at KSU for the duration of
their training; (3) provide U-RISE students a truly exceptional undergraduate research training, and; (4) facilitate
the successful transition of at least three U-RISE students into doctoral programs in the biomedical sciences.
Taking advantage of multiple recruitment avenues, a pool of high-achieving students from underrepresented
groups will be identified and nurtured. Successful program applicants will display an expressed interest in
pursuing a biomedical PhD or MD/PhD. Directed research and enrichment activities are planned for the two-year
appointment of each U-RISE trainee. Summer year one will feature training in foundational research skills,
responsible conduct, and methods to enhance reproducibility. In parallel, trainees will undergo three 2-week
research rotations before matching with their mentor. Throughout the junior and senior academic years, U-RISE
trainees will be required to conduct research with faculty mentors, while reinforcing core responsible conduct
and reproducibility tenets. Bi-monthly U-RISE seminars will build scientific identity, cohort cohesiveness, and
scientific communication. In spring semester year one, trainees will identify one or more labs at an R1 institution
to engage in summer research. After matching with their R1 lab, each trainee will spend U-RISE summer two
immersed in a 10-week R1 institute research experience. Fall semester year two will require an advanced team
research class, in addition to continuing projects with their KSU mentor. Fall bi-monthly seminars will prepare
trainees for doctoral program applications, while spring will feature doctoral interview preparation. Trainees will
receive peer and faculty mentoring throughout the two-year appointment. An advisory committee will oversee
program effectiveness. Using the above measurable objectives, survey instruments will be deployed by an
external evaluator to assess mentee training and mentor effectiveness. We will modify our program as needed,
based on survey outcomes. Results will be disseminated by our program website, conference proceedings, and
journal articles. If we are successful, at least fifteen U-RISE trainees will matriculate into biomedical PhD
programs over the five years of the project."
10802309,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Current ideas that systemic factors regulate the aging of cells and tissues, in terms of both promoting and
reversing the aging process, have emerged from studies of heterochronic parabiosis (HP) and heterochronic
blood exchange (HBE) protocols. Our lab performed the first HP studies in order to assess cellular aging and
rejuvenation as it relates to tissue homeostasis and repair and in terms of molecular determinants of cellular age.
Initially, we focused changes in muscle stem cells (MuSCs), but we and others later explored these phenotypic
changes in many different cell populations. Since then, we have explored the molecular mechanisms by which
systemic factors might influence the aging process. Based on numerous lines of evidence, we have hypothesized
that the alteration in cellular aging features is due to a form of epigenetic reprogramming that is akin to that which
occurs during induced pluripotent stem cell generation but without the loss of cellular differentiation.
 A general feature of cellular aging is the loss of heterochromatin and subsequent dysregulation of
transcriptional stability. Heterochromatin is prominently associated with specific histone modifications, most
notably by di- and tri-methylation of lysine 9 on histone 3 (H3K9me2 and H3K9me3, respectively). In Preliminary
Studies, we have shown the H3K9me3 and heterochromatin can be regulated in MuSCs, with loss of both leading
to features seen in aging cells. Based on these data and related published findings, the primary hypothesis of
this proposal is that a primary mediator of HP and HBE transposition of aging phenotypes to young and old cells
is the regulation of the cellular epigenome, and with a specific focus on H3K9 methylation and heterochromatin
formation.
 To test this hypothesis, this proposal is divided into three Specific Aims. Aim 1: To assess the transcriptional
and epigenetic signature of MuSCs in response to HP. We will establish HP and control pairs, and we will assess
the MuSC molecular signatures compared to control mice in assays of the transcriptome and the epigenome.
Aim 2: To examine the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the transposition of aging phenotypes in MuSCs.
Using genetic and pharmacologic tools, we will modulate H3K9 methylation in young and old MuSCs exposed
to young or old serum in vitro. We will test for the effect of changes in H3K9 methylation on the phenotypic
changes of MuSCs previously described in response to heterochronic serum exposure. Aim 3: To test in vivo
for the essential roles of H3K9 methyltransferase and demethylase activities in mediating the effects of HP on
MuSCs. We will use genetic and pharmacologic tools to modulate H3K9 methylation in MuSCs in vivo. We will
assess epigenetic and heterochromatin status, as well as the functional changes in MuSCs in response to HP.
Together, these studies will elucidate molecular mechanisms of epigenetic programming of age in response to
HP and HBE."

and a sense of belonging to the Marquette and greater science community. U-RISE students will engage in
course work, a summer research bootcamp, attend U-RISE and research seminars, write a pre-doctoral grant
proposal, and develop an individual development plan with their research mentors.
 Student selection for the U-RISE at Marquette will emphasize the inclusion of under-represented student
populations, first-generation college students, and women. While Marquette University has previously
committed to further expanding campus diversity and inclusion through resource expansion and opportunities,
the U-RISE at Marquette will serve as a prominent exemplar of Marquette’s mission -- Cura Personalis or

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative condition for which accurate and timely diagnosis
is key for optimal intervention and for guiding treatment when disease-modifying therapies become available.
Olfactory dysfunction is a core preclinical sign of AD that predicts conversion from mild cognitive impairment
(MCI) to AD with high sensitivity and specificity. The olfactory system is among the earliest brain regions to
demonstrate AD pathology and is the only sensory system that provides direct access to the entorhinal cortex
(ERC) and hippocampus, medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures critically important for cognitive and memory
decline in AD and MCI. Despite the relevance of olfactory dysfunction to the pathophysiology of AD, the
neurobiological underpinnings of olfactory impairment remain poorly understood. To date, clinical evaluation of
olfaction has been limited to psychophysical assessment, which is subjective and uninformative regarding
underlying physiological abnormalities of the olfactory system. We have developed advanced 7T MRI methods
to examine olfactory dysfunction and will use these methods to investigate microvascular and metabolic changes
of the olfactory system in prodromal Alzheimer's disease patients and controls. In Aims 1 and 2, we will examine
abnormalities in microvascular and metabolic parameters at rest and during olfactory stimulation. Importantly,
we will quantify each individual microvascular and metabolic parameter for different blood vessel types (arterioles
in particular) separately. These indices will be more biologically meaningful than the relatively global, nonspecific
indicators of compromised olfactory function obtained from the behavioral tests. In Aim 3, we will assess the
relationship between neurovascular abnormalities of the olfactory system and: olfactory behavioral measures;
structural changes measured by MRI; and established CSF biomarkers of AD, including beta amyloid, tau and
phosphorylated tau. A longitudinal follow-up of the cognitive measures will be collected after 2 years for all the
participants, which will be used to evaluate whether the MRI measures at the initial visit are predictive for
cognitive decline in these subjects. This work will significantly advance our understanding of the microvascular
and metabolic changes associated with olfactory impairment in MCI. The MRI measures used here are
noninvasive, repeatable for longitudinal investigations, and can be performed with high spatial resolution in
humans. Results from the proposed studies can facilitate the development of biomarkers for early identification
and prediction of AD and also has the potential to inform treatment studies for early intervention in AD."
10802314,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Protein misfolding is a key feature of many human diseases including most neurodegenerative diseases
and many cancers. Destruction of misfolded proteins is largely mediated by the proteasome, a 2.5 MDa
multisubunit complex which is the most sophisticated protease ever described. The proteasome's active sites
are sequestered within a barrel-shaped cylindrical chamber, known as the core particle (CP). Access of
substrates to the CP is mediated by the regulatory particle (RP), which recognizes proteasome substrates via
their ubiquitin tags. The RP unfolds, deubiquitinates, and injects the substrate into the CP where it is rendered
into small peptides. Pharmacologic inhibition of the proteasome is an established anti-cancer therapy, most
notably in multiple myeloma. Conversely, the possibility of enhancing proteasome function has generated
considerable interest in recent years. Such a strategy might ameliorate diseases caused by protein misfolding.
A key step in the generation of active proteasomes is the assembly of the 700 kDa 28-subunit CP, which
precedes assembly of the full proteasome and occurs by an ordered multistep pathway that requires the function
of five dedicated chaperone proteins. Structural analysis of CP maturation has been hampered by challenges in
isolating and characterizing assembly intermediates due to their low abundance and transitory nature. Here we
hypothesized that defined CP mutants may be enriched for assembly intermediates. We have developed a
productive work-flow for the affinity purification and structural analysis of these mutants, and have already
generated eight high resolution structures. In Aim 1, we will carry out this structural analysis of CP mutants using
Cryo-Electron Microscopy, coupled with detailed structure-function analyses. In Aim 2, we will characterize a
long-known but poorly understood regulator of the CP known as PI31/Fub1. We will attempt to determine its
structure in complex with the CP using Cryo-Electron Microscopy, and test a number of specific hypotheses
regarding its function. In Aim 3, we will characterize a novel protein which is a previously unrecognized
transcriptional target of the Rpn4-mediated proteasome biogenesis regulon, and which appears to be a new
proteasome-interacting protein. This proposal is expected to provide significant insight into proteasome
assembly and overall function, information which could lead to novel therapeutic strategies based on modulating
proteasome activity to treat diseases characterized by protein misfolding."
10800511,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an extremely deadly cancer, and current chemo/radiation therapies lack durable
effects. Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint blockades is effective for only ~13% of SCLC patients and
rarely results in sustained responses in extensive-stage SCLC. Targeted therapy development for SCLC is
challenging as SCLC tumors typically have few actionable drivers but instead are mainly driven by loss-of-
function mutations in RB1 and TP53 (>90%) and frequent loss and inactivation of other potential tumor
suppressors, including a set of epigenetic regulators. Nevertheless, recent discoveries from SCLC genomics
provide a new framework for understanding the biology of SCLC and identifying the molecular vulnerabilities of
the disease. Functional characterization of the recurrent mutations in putative tumor suppressor genes is crucial
for defining the mechanisms of tumorigenesis, which will facilitate the discovery of biomarkers for tumor
prevention and intervention. We recently identified a new tumor suppressor gene, CRACD (Capping protein
inhibiting Regulator of ACtin Dynamics; KIAA1211/CRAD). CRACD encodes a protein that binds to and inhibits
the capping proteins, thereby facilitating actin polymerization. CRACD is frequently mutated or transcriptionally
downregulated in SCLC patient tumors. Cracd knockout (KO) promotes the transformation of preneoplastic
precursor lung epithelial cells. Cracd KO also significantly accelerates SCLC development in an autochthonous
mouse model in which tumor initiation is induced by the deletion of Rb1, Trp53, and Rbl2 triple KO mouse
models. Cracd KO SCLC tumors harbor distinct root cell clusters with aberrant cell lineage trajectories and
impaired antigen presentation. Single-cell transcriptome analysis has further stratified SCLC patients by CRACD
inactivation and antigen presentation pathway impairment. Intriguingly, ablation of Cracd alone induces
hyperplasia of neuroendocrine cells and aberrant cell lineage plasticity in the mouse lung. These results led to
the hypothesis that CRACD inactivation induces aberrant neuroendocrine cell plasticity to initiate and promote
SCLC tumorigenesis via dysregulated nuclear actin dynamics and subsequent epigenetic reprogramming. The
proposed study will unveil the biology of SCLC initiation and progression and determine the cells-of-origin and
their relevant cell lineages inducing neuroendocrine cell plasticity, providing novel insight into SCLC
tumorigenesis. Additionally, this study will establish a new model system for SCLC initiation and progression and
introduce a novel somatic engineering system, which is technologically innovative. Completing this study will
also lay a solid foundation to determine whether CRACD loss is a molecular signature for specific SCLC patient
stratification and immunotherapy response prediction, which will be conceptually and clinically innovative."
10804616,"Imaging is a critical component in the detection, characterization and treatment of cancer. The rich
information content of advanced imaging methods, combined with the growing capacity to collect
multiple types of images from various sources and time points during therapy creates an exciting
opportunity for image-based guidance and assessment of interventions for radiation oncology, surgery,
and interventional radiology. In addition, the development of novel treatment techniques, including
radiation, minimally invasive surgery or targeted ablation, requires an accurate assessment of the
treatment results for personalized medicine. The ability to personalize treatment is critically dependent
on our ability to precisely measure and relate the delivered treatment with the corresponding outcome.
Quantitative assessment of therapeutic response through anatomical, functional, and metabolic
imaging has been identified by the NIH has a critical component in the advancement of local therapies.
Consistent longitudinal acquisition, correlation, and evaluation of these quantitative imaging biomarkers
across multiple therapies has the potential to improve the local control and reduce toxicities, ultimately
leading to improved patient outcomes through better cancer control and quality of life. These exciting
advances has led MD Anderson Cancer Center to develop an Image Guided Cancer Therapy Research
Program, which is empowering multidisciplinary teams of scientists and physicians to address clinical
challenges and technology barriers. The goal of this training program is to provide multi-disciplinary
research training for tomorrow’s pioneering leaders in image guided cancer therapy, including surgery,
interventional and diagnostic radiology, radiation oncology, and correlative pathology, using advanced
imaging, navigation, and analysis techniques. This training program is unique in that it trains, within a
single program, both scientists and clinician scientists working in image guided cancer therapy in all
three focal therapy disciplines of surgery, radiation oncology, and interventional radiology."
10814791,"Abstract
 Stents are implanted during the percutaneous treatment of narrowed arteries. However, limitations and
unresolved questions remain how to achieve optimal stent patency and safety. Bare metal stent (BMS)
deployment remains limited by neointimal hyperplasia caused by vascular injury during stent implantation,
leading to in-stent restenosis. To reduce restenosis, a drug-eluting stents (DES), coated with anti-proliferative
and/or immuno-suppressive agents targeting neointimal hyperplasia, have been developed. However, recent
studies have revealed that the clinically used dose of sirolimus and its analogues for DES cause serious adverse
effects including 1) damage to the endothelium that delays re-endothelialization with impaired functions, and 2)
inflammation in response to the polymer coating that delivers sirolimus.
 Another major issue in the stent industry is that outcomes from healthy animal model studies with or without
balloon injury do not adequately predict problems found when stents are used in a large number of patients.
Thus, there is a critical need to develop an innovative strategy for stent coating and stent evaluation in an
atherosclerosis model in order to address 1) adverse effects of clinical dose of sirolimus and 2) “overly optimistic”
findings when evaluating stents in a healthy rabbit model.
 We have successfully developed the nitric oxide (NO) releasing prohealing multifunctional endothelium-
mimicking nanomatrix stent coating capable of providing the chemical and biological properties of the native
endothelium as demonstrated in vitro, ex vivo, and in a balloon injury healthy rabbit iliac artery model. Notably,
we recently found that NO has significant potential to salvage endothelial cell proliferation and migration from
the adverse effects of sirolimus while synergistically suppressing smooth muscle cell proliferation.
 Therefore, we will develop the dual action NO and low-dose liposome-encapsulated sirolimus releasing
prohealing nanomatrix in Specific Aim 1. We will also develop novel Engineered Artery Sheets with
Atherosclerotic features (eASA) in Specific Aim 2. The efficacy of the dual action NO and sirolimus releasing
prohealing nanomatrix compared with commercial BMS and DES will be evaluated under atherosclerotic
conditions using the eASA in Specific Aim 2 and in a high fat diet rabbit model in Specific Aim 3.
 If successful, this novel strategy, combining the unique features of NO and sirolimus will advance the field by
overcoming the current limitations of BMS and DES, and with the development of improved in vitro and in vivo
models for stent evaluation."
10814792,"The pathological aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein tau and its subsequent
deposition in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are defining histopathological features of Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) and many other neurodegenerative disorders. Although accumulated tau protein
aggregates in the brain are a consistent hallmark of AD, there is a vast array in the progression
rate of disease and diversity in symptoms. An expansive body of evidence demonstrates that AD
shares important characteristics with prion diseases in terms of protein aggregation where
conformational variants of tau and Aβ can induce templating of aggregation in cell models or in
vivo. Recent advances have spurred a series of critical questions as i) how variable tau aggregate
strains can be, ii) formation of tau strains with the ability of spreading within the brain regions and
induce aggregation of native tau, iii) the propensity of diverse tau strains to precede and
accompany other amyloid aggregation.
Our central hypothesis is that the biological properties of AD-relevant tau oligomer strains in
specific genetic background and mixed protein pathologies are encoded in the structure of these
aggregates. Thus, the interplay/competition between distinct tau oligomer strains is a critical
determinant in controlling the extent of disease progression and initiating definite toxicity
cascades in AD. The identification of the most dominant and latent strains will be crucial for the
design of personalized therapeutic strategies by enhancing accurate targeting of the toxic
species.
This proposal is based on our excellent progress and exciting preliminary data and supported by
our competent team and collaborators, will address tau oligomeric strain biology and the
unexplored role of domination in oligomer stains, thus regulating disease progression and
phenotypes in AD, one of the most relevant contemporary NIH mission areas. The novel insights
gained from this study will lead to the future designing of clinical trials and the possibility for
personalized medicine."
10814795,"Intercalated cells (ICs) in the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron (ASDN) secrete H+ and HCO3-. Emerging
evidence has identified nontraditional roles for ICs, including absorption of filtered Na+ and Cl-, flow-induced K+
secretion (FIKS) and participation in innate immunity. Apical BK channels in ICs are activated by a flow-
stimulated increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). The rapid initial mechanoinduced increase in
[Ca2+]i reflects basolateral Ca2+ entry and release of internal Ca2+ stores. Piezo1, a member of a family of
mechanosensitive non-selective cation channels, is expressed along the basolateral membrane of ICs and
principal cells (PCs) in the ASDN. In preliminary studies, we found that a Piezo1 inhibitor dampens both the flow-
induced [Ca2+]i response in cortical collecting ducts (CCDs) as well as FIKS, whereas an activator increases
[Ca2+]i in CCDs perfused at slow flow rates. The flow-induced IC [Ca2+]i response was largely absent in CCDs
from mice with an IC-specific genetic deletion of Piezo1. These observations suggest that Piezo1 mediates flow-
induced early basolateral Ca2+ entry into ASDN epithelial cells, a key factor in the activation of BK channels.
Based on these observations, we hypothesize that Piezo1 channels function as mechanosensors in the ASDN
and enable FIKS by facilitating basolateral Ca2+ entry and secondarily activating luminal Ca2+ entry pathways in
ICs. Experiments proposed in Aim 1 will define the localization and developmental expression of Piezo1 in the
ASDN, and cell type-specific changes in Piezo1 expression in CCDs in response to a low K+ (LK) or high K+ (HK)
diet, or aldosterone. Studies in Aim 2 will determine the effects of Piezo1 activators and inhibitors on basal and
flow-stimulated [Ca2+]i, effects on net transepithelial Na+ and K+ transport (JNa and JK) in CCDs isolated from
control K+ (CK) and HK fed mice, and effects on IC BK channel activity as assessed by patch clamp. Studies
proposed in Aim 3 will determine whether targeted deletion of Piezo1 in ICs alters K+ handling in mice, affects
flow-induced increases in [Ca2+]i and JNa and JK in microperfused CCDs, and affects IC BK channel activity as
assessed by patch clamp. We expect that the results of our proposed studies will uncover novel and unexpected
pathways involved in urinary K+ excretion and identify potential targets for novel therapies to treat K+ imbalances."

Our proposal to establish the Colorado Resource Center for Tribal Epidemiology Centers capitalizes on the
Centers for American Indian and Alaska Native Health’s 30+ year, nationwide experience providing high quality,
scientifically grounded, culturally informed training and technical assistance to hundreds of Native programs
through resource centers that addressed needs similar to those highlighted in RFA-MD-21-003. We marry this
programmatic focus with an equally superior record of preparing Native investigators to compete for NIH-
sponsored research and, thereby, enhance the nature, extent, and quality of the science undertaken by Tribal
Epidemiology Centers (TECs). Accordingly, the specific aims of our Resource Center-TEC are to:
1) Jointly plan, issue, monitor, and evaluate subawards of varying degrees of support to each TEC consistent
with local priorities and needs that progressively expand their capacity to engage in the full spectrum of
research activities ranging from data acquisition, management, and analysis to data visualization,
interpretation, and reporting.
2) Provide technical assistance to each TEC to design, implement, and analyze both primary data acquisition
as well as secondary data analytic studies consistent with local priorities, and to prepare as well as
disseminate lay, program, policy, and scientific reports of findings to a wide array of audiences.
3) Enhance the research capacity of TEC personnel across all levels of preparation by drawing upon an
extensive body of existing instructional materials and experience to offer:
a. bimonthly interactive, 2-hour didactic sessions on timely data science topics;
b. on-line, short-course offerings that target foundational and intermediary knowledge and skills regarding
 data collection, linkage, management, and analysis;
c. once annually, a 6-month, mentored grant-writing course for senior TEC personnel—tailored to the
interests and priorities of their respective key stakeholders—to increase the number of submitted and
funded NIH R-series grant applications, and
d. a year-long research career development program for early-stage investigators to add to and retain them
in the health disparities scientific workforce.
4) Promote collaborative research between the TECs and external investigators by disseminating information
about sponsored research opportunities and related resources and building upon our current Satellite Center
research network led by senior, NIH-funded American Indian and Alaska Native health disparities scientists
at 7 adjacent major institutions, and other organizational partnerships.
Recent calls to action by advocates underscore the important contribution of research to address the health
priorities of Native peoples. This Resource Center will enable TECs to bring this vision to fruition."
10815288,"PROJECT SUMMARY
While cerebral oxygen delivery depends on the cerebral blood flow (CBF; ml blood/100g tissue/minute) and
blood oxygen content, it is becoming increasingly recognized that blood capillary transit time itself can also
influence tissue oxygen extraction, even in the presence of normal or elevated CBF. In individuals with
anemia where accelerated capillary flow velocities may be present as a result of hyperemia and
cerebral autoregulation, reduced capillary transit time can lead to reduced times for tissue oxygen
offloading. Compelling evidence has been provided for heterogeneous capillary flow underlying abnormal
oxygen delivery in multiple conditions including expansion of infarcts in acute ischemic stroke, traumatic brain
injury, and Alzheimer's disease. In sickle cell anemia (SCA), we have observed that rapid capillary transit,
visible on arterial spin labeling (ASL) CBF-weighted MRI, is present in more than 50% of adults and children.
We have shown in published work and preliminary data from 154 adults and children with SCA that
hyperintense ASL signal within cerebral dural venous sinuses is directly associated with elevated arterial
velocities, elevated CBF, and reduced oxygen extraction fraction (OEF; ratio of oxygen consumed to oxygen
delivered), and that this effect may reduce following transfusion therapies that improve oxygen delivery to
tissue. These findings indicate that venous hyperintense signal on ASL images may represent a marker of
capillary-level disturbances in oxygen exchange efficiency. One of the most impactful findings of our
preliminary work is that we have observed that rapid capillary-level arterio-venous transit is associated
with reduced oxygen metabolism, suggesting that these transit times may provide a biomarker of
cerebral ischemia in individuals with SCA who have greater than a 50% risk of cerebral infarcts by age
30 years, yet often lack conventional stroke risk factors. Here, we propose to refine neuroimaging
methods for evaluating arterio-venous transit to allow for robust, quantitative measures of capillary transit time
non-invasively in vivo, and subsequently to test fundamental hypotheses regarding cerebral oxygen utilization
in anemic individuals with vs. without infarcts. Aim (1): To apply innovative ASL MRI methods and time
regression analyses over major intracranial arteries and dural sinuses in healthy control and SCA participants.
Aim (2): To quantify cerebral capillary transit time in SCA participants before and after treatment with blood
transfusion to understand how increases in hemoglobin parallel an improvement in brain oxygen extraction.
Aim (3): To test the hypothesis that arterio-venous transit times are reduced in individuals with SCA with
versus without infarcts. The short-term goal is to utilize non-invasive imaging approaches to understand
mechanisms of oxygen utilization and neurovascular dysfunction in anemia. The long-term goal is to
use this information to triage individuals with anemia for personalized stroke prevention therapies, as
well as to objectively quantify the impact of these therapies on brain health."
10814861,"Project Summary/Abstract
We seek to validate a quantitative method to predict the risk of pathologic vertebral fracture (PVF) in cancer
patients treated with radiotherapy for metastatic spine disease before the onset of these complications.
Vertebral bone is the most frequent site of skeletal metastasis. Radiation therapy aims to palliate pain and
reduce the risk of PVF. However, PVF are a common complication afflicting up to 39% of patients within 6
months after-radiotherapy. Clinical guidelines for estimating fracture risk remain subjective and suffer from low
specificity and sensitivity. Improved prediction of PVF risk would facilitate selection of whether, how, and when
to intervene prior to the occurrence of PVF. Such individualized prediction is not available in clinical practice.
 As part of our previous NIH grant, we have developed a computed tomography (CT) based structural
analysis (CT-SAP) to successfully predict the failure of human spines with lytic defects. Based on these
accomplishments, the objectives of this observational prospective study are threefold: 1) To test the
performance of CT-SAP (providing a snapshot of bone structure and calcium content) and bone turnover
markers (providing an indication of disease trajectory) for predicting the baseline risk of vertebral fractures in
a cohort of patients treated with radiotherapy for spinal bone metastases. For this purpose, we will acquire the
standard clinical CT and serum sample at the patient's radiotherapy planning. From the CT, we will derive
individualized estimates of vertebral strength (CT-SAP) and vertebral loading to compute the loading /
strength ratio for both treated and untreated vertebrae, and measure the value for markers for bone
resorption and formation from the serum sample. We will test the independent association of the vertebral
loading / strength ratio and marker value with the observed vertebral fractures within 6 months after treatment.
This novel data will provide information on the effect of radiation and metastatic disease on the baseline and
short term risk of vertebral fracture in this patient cohort. 2) To establish the performance of the spinal
instability neoplastic score (SINS) for predicting the patient's risk of vertebral fracture within 6 months after
treatment and test whether adding the load / strength ratio (CT-SAP) and bone turnover risk models,
independently and combined, improves the model's performance. This will establish a new paradigm for
individualized prediction of baseline risk for fracture in this patient cohort. 3) To test the established model
performance for predicting the evolving risk of PVF within a 3 month interval by acquiring and analyzing the
CT scans and serum samples collected at 3, 6, and 9 months after treatment as part of standard clinical care.
This time period provides clinically meaningful guidelines for assessing the impact of a low vs. high risk of PVF
to the health and quality of life of this infirm population with short life expectancy. Successful completion of this
project will address a critical gap in our ability to individualize evaluation and management of these patients."
10814967,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) carries a dismal prognosis, due largely to the fact that it
metastasizes early and is typically detected late, when tumors can no longer be resected. Obesity increases
an individual’s risk of developing PDA, although the mechanisms driving this link are poorly understood. This
proposal investigates the hypothesis that insulin signaling in PDA cells promotes metabolic alterations and
changes in gene expression that facilitate tumor development and progression, potentially pointing towards
new strategies to prevent PDA in at-risk populations or to improve PDA treatment outcomes.
Histone acetylation is highly sensitive to the availability of the acetyl donor acetyl-CoA, and our previous work
has defined a role for the metabolic enzyme ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) in the regulation of histone acetylation
levels in diverse mammalian cell types. Histone acetylation plays key roles in PDA tumorigenesis, although
the mechanisms that drive altered histone acetylation are not well understood. In preliminary studies, we have
found that insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) stimulation of PDA cells results in ACLY Ser455
phosphorylation, increasing its activity, as well as elevated levels of global histone acetylation. ACLY is
phosphorylated downstream of AKT, and AKT inhibition suppresses histone acetylation globally and at cancer-
relevant loci. We hypothesize that elevated insulin/IGF levels promote metabolic and transcriptional
remodeling in PDA cells, promoting tumor progression. To test this, we will define the role of insulin/IGF
signaling in metabolic and epigenetic remodeling in KRAS mutant PDA cells, using a combination of
hypothesis-driven and unbiased approaches. Finally, we will test the role of ACLY in mediating obesity-linked
pancreatic tumorigenesis, as well as the potential to target acetyl-CoA-dependent processes to suppress tumor
growth and improve therapeutic responses. This study will elucidate new mechanisms through which systemic
metabolism influences cellular metabolism and the tumor epigenome. Findings from this study have potential
to provide a mechanistic rationale for nutritional recommendations for PDA patients and/or to identify new
therapeutic targets to prevent tumor recurrence after surgical resection or to use in conjunction with
chemotherapy to improve its efficacy."
10814970,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Atherosclerosis is the leading cause of human mortality worldwide. There has been a great interest in
developing novel therapeutics for this disease that function via an orthogonal mechanism of action to currently
available drugs. One promising strategy is to enhance the function of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs). HDLs
facilitate reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) to transfer excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver
for elimination. The proposed research, supported by strong recent progress, seeks to advance a novel
supramolecular strategy for improving HDL function in vivo to combat atherosclerosis.
 The proposed studies build on the successes of our research program, funded by an NHLBI R01 grant over
the past eight years. Despite substantial progress in the field of apolipoprotein mimetic peptides, including
evaluation of several candidates in phase 1 and 2 human clinical trials, the inherent pharmacological
shortcomings typically associated with linear peptides have been a major impediment to advancing HDL-
modulating peptides through the clinic. Our proposed research seeks to develop a novel class of chemotypes
that can recapitulate the functional attributes of helical lipoprotein mimetics, but without their inherent limitations.
We have established that appropriately designed eight-residue self-assembling cyclic D,L-a-peptides are
effective HDL modulating agents that can remodel human and mouse plasma HDLs and enhance cholesterol
efflux from macrophage cells. These peptides specifically increase the level of pre-beta HDL particles
(subspecies of HDLs considered to be the most anti-atherogenic), reduce LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels,
and promote anti-inflammatory effects with concomitant prevention of atherosclerosis in mouse disease models.
The abiotic structure of cyclic D,L-a-peptides overcomes many of the shortcomings typically associated with
linear peptides, such as low serum/plasma stability and high production costs, among others.
 Specific aims 1 and 2 of the proposed research involve i) implementing a series of mechanism-based
functional bioassays and biophysical assays to optimize and better characterize the mode of action of the lead
compounds, and ii) establishing in vivo pharmacology, toxicology, and efficacy of selected cyclic peptides in two
leading mouse models of atherosclerosis. Specific aim 3 of the proposed research is based on an unexpected,
remarkable observation made in the course of our recent studies. We have discovered that trifluoroacetate (TFA),
administered orally or parenterally, causes dose-dependent reductions in plasma cholesterol levels and prevents
the development of atherosclerosis in vivo. The implications of this discovery are potentially broad because
nearly all synthetic peptides, employed across diverse biological settings, contain TFA counterions resulting from
purification by preparative HPLC. As such, the effects of TFA on cellular metabolism in vitro and in vivo must be
characterized and understood. We propose a series of hypothesis-based in vitro and in vivo studies to define
the mechanism and generality of the observed TFA-mediated anti-atherosclerosis effects."
10814971,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Two decades since the development of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV infection, HIV-positive
people who use illicit drugs (PWUD) continue to experience persistent disparities in HIV treatment outcomes.
Although the deleterious impact of high-intensity illicit drug use on access and adherence to ART is clear, the
social, structural and economic barriers to engagement and retention in HIV care remain incompletely
described, and there is an urgent need to identify aspects of treatment for HIV and addiction that promote
optimal HIV treatment outcomes.
 At the same time, there is an increasing appreciation of the importance of HIV-associated comorbidities,
coinfections and complications—especially immunologic dysfunction, chronic inflammation and premature
aging—on HIV disease outcomes, even among HIV-positive individuals optimally engaged in ART. Although
the impact of some comorbidities, such as hepatitis C virus co-infection, on HIV-positive PWUD are well
described, we are unaware of any longitudinal study using a validated measure incorporating HIV- and non-
HIV-related clinical biomarkers to systematically investigate HIV disease severity, and the impact of illicit drug
use and related social, structural and economic factors, among HIV-positive PWUD in a setting of no-cost
universal medical care including all ART and medications for addiction treatment.
 Thus, in this application, we propose novel and significant investigations into the individual, social,
structural and economic determinants of HIV treatment and disease outcomes among PWUD. Specifically,
through the renewal of funding for a longstanding community-recruited prospective cohort of more than 1000
HIV-positive PWUD linked to comprehensive clinical monitoring data in Vancouver, Canada, we propose to:
analyze the implementation, uptake and impact of new and emerging treatment for HIV and addiction on the
achievement and maintenance of optimal HIV treatment and disease outcomes; investigate the impacts of
established and emerging illicit drug use patterns and evolving approaches to addiction treatment on HIV
treatment and disease outcomes; explore the interrelationships between social, structural and economic forces
and illicit drug use patterns on HIV disease outcomes; and continue to serve as a NIDA-funded cohort that is a
platform for a range of epidemiological, phylogenetic/bioinformatic and basic research into HIV acquisition,
transmission and pathogenesis among people who use illicit drugs.
 This proposal to renew our research program exploits several established and emerging facets of the
local environment, including: a centralized program of universal access to no-cost medical care, allowing for
the complete ascertainment of clinical data free of the confounding influence of financial ability; the ongoing
development of a range of innovative HIV and addiction programs for PWUD, including initiation of ART upon
HIV diagnosis, harm-reduction-based HIV prevention and treatment supports; and novel approaches to
manage opioid and stimulant use disorders. Our proposal is well aligned with recent calls for high-priority
research to reduce disparities in HIV treatment and disease outcomes among HIV-positive PWUD through
evidence to promote engagement and retention in HIV care and reduce the effect of comorbidities,
complications and coinfections."
10822850,"Personal Cooling Garments to Protect at-Risk Patients from Extreme Heat Waves
Project Summary/Abstract
Global warming is resulting in more intense, more frequent, and longer periods of extreme heat
events, which have caused numerous diseases and, in some cases, fatalities. Heat stress could
especially impact patients with heart, lung, and blood diseases. Patients suffering from heart
disease, poor blood circulation, high blood pressure, obesity, as well as the elderly have a higher
risk for heat-related illness due to low sensitivity in temperature changes and weak self-regulation
capability. A lightweight personal cooling garment could be a game-changing solution to protect
at-risk patients with cardiovascular, lung, blood, and other diseases during extreme heat events.
However, today’s personal cooling garments are not adequate as they are often too bulky and
heavy, have limited cooling duration, and have no or limited temperature controllability. There is
a strong need for a personal cooling garment with effective cooling, adjustable temperature,
lightweight, is flexible & wearable, consumes less power (high coefficient of performance), and
has low cost. The project aims to develop and test prototypes of personal active cooling garments
to protect at-risk patients from heat waves. The project will leverage the core intellectual property
developed at UCSD on flexible thermoelectric devices (f-TEDs). GE&R LLC and UCSD will
establish a high-throughput manufacturing process to scale up the fabrication of flexible f-TEGs
specifically designed for personal cooling, integrate them into garments with temperature-control
electronics and power supply, and test the garments using lab benchtop experiments. We will
participate in the NSF I-Corps program at UCSD to interview potential users and conduct a market
survey for further development towards commercialization."

10819490,"Abstract/Summary (Administrative Core; Core 1)
The Administrative Core provides oversight of the Center for Gene Therapy of Cystic Fibrosis (CF), under the
supervision of the Center Executive Committee and External Advisors. One major area of responsibility is
largely administrative, including financial documentation and accountability for the Center's Pilot and Feasibility
Program and its Cores, and oversight of external review of the Center overall. Three major governing bodies
contribute to the review of various Center functions. The Pilot and Feasibility Committee oversees decisions
regarding pilot funding, with each pilot receiving two external reviews before a decision is made. The Executive
Committee is the major decision-making body of the Center, and makes final judgments about the funding of
new pilots and the renewal of ongoing pilots for a second year of funding. The External Advisory Committee
provides direction to the Executive Committee, as does the College of Medicine leadership. A second major
responsibility of this Core is to enrich CF-related scientific programs, and it does so through sustained
membership and pilot recruitment efforts, scientific enrichment programs (seminar series, retreats, workshops,
and less formal scientific working-group meetings), and assessment of the Center's Research Cores and their
services (e.g., through investigator questionnaires and external review). Lastly, the Administrative Core acts as
a conduit for research and services to both investigators outside the University of Iowa and the lay community
(e.g., by maintaining the Center web site). In summary, the Administrative Core assists its members in making
breakthroughs in CF research and molecular therapies by: 1) recruiting talented junior investigators into
careers in CF research and mentoring them, through its pilot program and Center activities; 2) assisting the
Research Cores in providing efficient, high quality, and cost-effective services; and 3) providing forums for the
exchange of new information and ideas among its members through its Enrichment Programs."
10819492,"Abstract/Summary Vector Core (Core 2)
The Vector Core at the University of Iowa serves multiple projects directed at the study of cystic fibrosis and
therapy development. The interaction with multiple investigators from various disciplines allows for cross-
fertilization of ideas, technical advancements, and innovations in vector designs. The overall objective of the
Vector Core is to support investigators in generating and implementing gene delivery and gene editing
technologies. This includes consultation with the Principle Investigator, development of novel vectors, and
routine vector preparation. The Core staff and investigators are in close contact through all phases of vector
design and generation. Thus, the Core serves as both a research & development facility for gene transfer
studies and a service facility for routine vector preparations. The Core provides purified and concentrated
preparations of recombinant adenovirus, adeno-associated virus (AAV), vaccinia, baculovirus and retrovirus
(including lentivirus). These vectors have proven success at delivering therapeutic transgenes or CRISPR-
based technologies to airway cells. Additional services include access to standard cell lines, expression
plasmids, and stocks of reporter viruses.
The main responsibilities of the Vector Core will be:
· Viral Vector Production
· Research and Development
· Education
· Materials Archive
Delivery vectors for gene replacement or genome engineering strategies in airway epithelia could confer long-
term correction of the CF phenotype. In addition, such vectors can be used for hypothesis driven research
such as labeling progenitor cells within the airways. There have been important advancements in approaches
to rescue CFTR protein function. However similar therapies for the most common mutation is not yet available.
The goal of the Vector Core is to provide support for researchers working to develop a life-long gene
replacement strategy that would be efficacious regardless of the disease causing mutation. The Core
specializes in gene transfer and gene editing technologies that provide Principle Investigators with delivery
vehicles for therapeutic genes such as CFTR. The reagents, methods, and guidance generated by this core
provide an important service addressing CF therapies."
10819494,"Abstract/Summary (Animal Models Core–Core 3)
Animal models of cystic fibrosis (CF) are critical for the development of effective molecular therapies. In
particular, animal models that reproduce the clinical manifestations of CF are necessary for elucidating the
pathophysiologically relevant cellular targets for gene therapy, and aid in the development and testing of both
gene and cell therapies for CF. The Animal Models Core (AMC) provides support to investigators who use
animal models to study CF pathogenesis, as well as to those who develop molecular therapies for CF.
Specifically, it provides centralized production, care, breeding, genotyping, and quality control of CF mouse
and ferret models used by Center investigators. Additionally, the AMC has served as a conduit for the
dissemination of CF pig tissue specimens from other funded programs in the Carver College of Medicine.
However, because of the high cost of maintaining CF pigs, the AMC has not established its own colony,
instead relying on two established PPGs, directed by Drs. Stoltz and McCray, to gain access to pig samples.
The AMC also assists in the management of BSL2 containment and compliance in animal experiments
involving recombinant viruses. Technicians within the Core perform the more technically challenging aspects of
studies in CF animal models, such as administering viral vectors, glucose clamps, mixed meal tolerance tests,
and oral glucose tolerance tests, as well as testing of drugs and harvesting tissue. Recently, the AMC was
instrumental in developing new methods of genetic engineering involving the CRISPR/Cas9 system. This new
technology circumvents the need for somatic cell nuclear transfer in the generation of ferret models and has
enabled the creation of ROSA26 knock-in Cre-reporter ferrets, cell-specific IRES-CreERT2 driver knock-in
ferrets, and conditional CFTR-knockout ferrets. These new lines are enabling Center Members to trace the
fates of endocrine progenitors in the CF pancreas and to study CFTR function in specific cell populations.
Together with a CFTRG551D ferret generated and characterized during the last funding period, these lines are
expected to lead to considerable expansion of the services the AMC provides to the research community.
During the last 5 years the AMC greatly increased its dissemination of CF ferret tissue to investigators, serving
over 70 researchers at or outside UI and disseminating over 3000 specimens, enabling cost-effective broad
use of the model. The majority of AMC effort is directed toward CF gene therapy and CF pathophysiology,
providing extensive support for research on CF-related diabetes and disease pathology in the lung, pancreas,
intestine, vas deferens, and gallbladder."

The Clinical Core (Core 6) facilitates translational research in CF human subjects and human samples. This

biobanking of CF and non-CF control specimens and the increasing involvement of Center Members in clinical
studies seeking to ask basic scientific questions in humans and compare these findings to the CF mouse,
ferret and pig models. Major objectives of the core include assistance in recruiting and identifying patients
suitable for various investigator-driven CF clinical trials and studies. This Core functions under the umbrella of
the Institute for Clinical and Translational Science (ICTS) and will benefit from its resources and support for
translational clinical research.
The main goals of the Core are:
 1. To sustain an umbrella biobank to archive biosamples collected during routine clinical visits and
 research-related visits, and to obtain consent from current and future CF patients for this biobank.
 2. To acquire normal and CF specimens including DNA, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), whole
 blood, plasma, feces, urine, and bacterial isolates.
 3. To maintain databases of historical clinical samples and prospectively collected samples, including
 molecular typing of bacterial and other isolates when available.
 4. To support a standardized process through which investigators can obtain de-identified or identified
 clinical information about archived clinical samples or prospectively obtained samples from routine
 clinical bloodwork (e.g. samples from oral glucose tolerance testing, or routine liver function monitoring)
 5. To assist basic and translational researchers in obtaining specific biological samples that are not
 routinely banked (e.g. surgical discarded specimens such as the gallbladder following
cholecystectomy).
 6. To facilitate patient recruitment and enrollment in clinical trials and studies, particularly early phase
 trials of novel therapies and mechanistic or pathophysiology studies.
 7. To assist investigators in conducting clinical trials and preparing IRB submissions, and to ensure that
 clinical research is conducted in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and
 appropriate biostatistical analysis."

Cancer disparities impacting African Americans are deeply rooted in historical social injustices such as
structural racism, housing discrimination and redlining, struggling educational systems, and concentrated
poverty. It is well-established that the neighborhood where a person lives can have a considerable impact on
their health and health behaviors. This includes cancer control behaviors, a primary driver of cancer incidence
and mortality. Our preliminary data suggests that neighborhood characteristics contribute uniquely to cancer
control behaviors beyond individual factors in African Americans. However, little is known about multi-level and
longitudinal influences of structural racism and discrimination in predicting cancer control behaviors, and the
potential role of protective psychosocial resources. This is particularly true among African Americans, who
suffer a disproportionate cancer burden. The proposed study will quantitatively measure SRD, evaluate its
longitudinal role in cancer control behaviors, and examine the moderating role of psychosocial resources in
African American adults. In Aim 1, we will construct an index of structural racism and discrimination from
publicly available data for use in the Aims 2 and 3 analysis. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the relative contributions
of the impact of historical, long-term, and current place-based exposure to structural racism and discrimination
on cancer control behaviors (e.g., diet, smoking, physical activity, screening) in probability samples of African
Americans from four focal states (N=5000) via a multilevel analysis. In Aim 3, we will test the moderating role
of psychosocial resources in the relationship between exposure to SRD and cancer control behaviors in
African Americans. Study findings will have important implications for policy and community interventions to
eliminate persistent cancer disparities that disproportionately impact African Americans."
10820095,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Ovarian Cancer (OvCa) is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths for women and is associated with very low
survivability. Current treatment strategies for OvCa largely include surgery and chemotherapy. Chemotherapy,
which often involves platinum-containing drugs and taxanes, can be effective; however, many patients
experience complications due to side effects and/or resistance to the chemotherapy. Alternative options are
needed to provide effective treatment strategies for OvCa patients. Immuno-oncology (IO) drugs have shown to
improve treatment outcomes for some cancers by enabling a patient’s immune system to launch an immune
attack against the tumor. However, the efficacy of current IO drugs (e.g., immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)) is
low due to their inability to generate immunogenic tumors. Current IO drugs stop immunosuppression only from
cancer cells; immunosuppression from immunosuppressor cells such as the Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells
(MDSCs) remains intact thereby sustaining an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. While eliminating
MDSCs is perceived as a strategy for overcoming immunosuppression, clinical trials have shown that eliminating
MDSCs alone is insufficient to reduce tumor burden. Current drugs that can eliminate MDSCs are unsuitable as
they lack selectivity to target MDSCs and non-specifically deplete other immune cells. Hence, tumor specific
elimination of only MDSCs whilst eliminating cancer cells is a major unmet clinical need.
TRIO Pharmaceuticals (TRIO) is fulfilling the need by developing a new class of cancer drugs, referred to as
TRAILBody™, which are designed to eliminate both cancer cells and MDSCs by selective activation of
TRAIL-R2 mediated apoptosis without engaging immune effector cells and conjugated toxins. TRAILBodies
target cancer cells by binding a tumor specific antigen and target MDSCs by binding FcγRII. TRAILBodies
eliminate both cancer cells and MDSCs by TRAIL-R2 mediated apoptosis upon engaging the tumor specific
antigen and FcγRII, respectively. In this SBIR proposal, TRIO is developing a TRAILBody™ for OvCa: αFOLR1
× TRAIL-R2, referred to as TRIO-628. TRIO-628 is designed to improve OvCa treatment efficacy by generating
immunogenic tumors via eliminating cancer cells by targeting FOLR1 (overexpressed in OvCa) and eliminating
MDSCs by targeting FcγRII. Preliminary studies have shown a high degree of selectivity of αFOLR1 × TRAIL-
R2 for its targets and enhanced anti-tumor activity in comparison to lexatumumab. The goal of the Phase I
program is to establish TRIO-628 as an OvCa drug. This goal will be met through the execution of two Specific
Aims, which will involve in vitro assessments of the selectivity of TRIO-628 in depleting MDSCs and enhancing
tumor immunity and an in vivo efficacy study of TRIO-228 using a platinum resistant patient-derived xenograft
model. Successful completion of Phase I will provide critical in vivo proof-of-concept data for using TRIO-628 to
treat OVCA and support a Phase II proposal focused on safety and tolerability studies and translation studies to
advance the IND efforts."
10820097,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Functional Fluidics (FF) is developing a rapid integrated test for assessing RBC sickling based on hypoxia-
induced changes in cell morphology as a potential indicator of efficacy of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) treatment
efficacy and overall patient condition. The medical care for persons with SCD has been recognized as a
significant burden to healthcare with an annual cost exceeding $1.1 billion in the US alone with up to 80% of the
costs associated with inpatient care. There is a pressing need for assays to both assess patient condition and to
monitor the progress of new SCD therapies, especially when such are expected to affect Hb polymerization
kinetics and outcomes. It could be beneficial for such an assay to allow assessment of oxygen dissociation under
both equilibrium (mimicking a longer-term effects) and non-equilibrium (simulating in-vivo process) conditions.
Also desirable is the CLIA-waived system suitable for use at Point of Care (POC) for monitoring in a doctor’s
office or a clinic. Measurements using such systems could improve personalized treatment for patients using
different drugs and in clinical trials for new therapeutics targeting RBC. For SCD, many clinical trials are presently
performed in developing countries, further highlighting the need for a simple and inexpensive system to track
treatment progress. The goal of this Phase I Project is to develop and initially validate a SS-RBC hypoxia-induced
sickling assay (the Dynamic Sickling Assay, DSA) as a simple to use, stand-alone, and potentially CLIA-waived
POC device with single use disposable cartridges to be used in a) a research tool assist in drug development in
SCD space, and b) a clinical system to assess SCD patient condition and to assist in monitoring and optimization
of SCD treatment, especially with drugs affecting Hb-oxygen affinity. The system proposes the use of an
enzymatic oxygen scrubbing system for both quasi-equilibrium measurements and for fast kinetic sickling
assessment. The goal of this work will be 1) the proposed assay can show sufficient relevance to Hb profile of
blood samples from SCD patients and 2) the test results can provide sufficient sensitivity and specificity to
monitor therapeutic response of RBC modifying agents. The goal of future Phase 2 work would be to further
optimize and clinically validate where future work would support an FDA submission (likely a Class 2 diagnostic
device through De NOVO pathway) for use in clinical management of SCD patients. Success with these goals
would improve therapeutic outcomes in patients with dramatically different SCD clinical presentations."

The overall objective of this proposal is to further our understanding of the biology and therapeutic potential of
C-type natriuretic peptide in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Cardiac fibrosis a key risk factor for the
development adverse outcomes in HCM, however, there is no proven medical therapy for HCM that modifies
fibrosis in humans, which represents a critical unmet need. The natriuretic peptides ANP and BNP are
increased in HCM. However, there is also a third natriuretic peptide, CNP, and we show that HCM is a state of
CNP deficiency. CNP is the most potent anti-fibrotic natriuretic peptide, and augmenting CNP is a novel approach
to target fibrosis in HCM. However, systemic delivery of CNP requires innovative approaches to minimize CNP
degradation. C53 is a potent CNP analog with resistance to degradation. Our preliminary data demonstrate that
administration of C53 attenuates the emergence of fibrosis in the 403/+ mouse model of HCM. The objective
of this proposal is to validate the anti-fibrotic mechanism of C53 in HCM, and determine if C53 can
attenuate or reverse fibrosis in established HCM. To further define the antifibrotic effects of C53 in HCM, the
following Specific Aims will be addressed. 1) Define the mechanism by which C53 modifies fibrosis (K99 phase).
With tailored training, the candidate will learn and perform established functional in vitro assays using
pharmacologic modulators to define the mechanism by which C53 modifies fibrosis. 2) Develop expertise in
small animal cardiac MRI to evaluate myocardial fibrosis in vivo (K99 phase). 3) Test the hypothesis C53 can
attenuate or reverse established HCM, and validate the molecular and cellular mechanism of C53 in vivo (R00
phase). The candidate’s career goals are to become an independent physician-scientist focusing on innovative
approaches to target fibrosis in HCM. The career development plan focuses on learning new skills for in vitro
quantification of fibroblast activity, learning advanced histologic quantification of fibrosis, and learning small
animal cardiac MRI for evaluation of cardiac fibrosis in vivo. The Merryman lab at Vanderbilt is an ideal
environment to acquire such training as Dr. Merryman is an expert in cardiopulmonary mechanobiology and
fibrosis. The training received throughout this award will enable the PI to secure an independent research
position and lead a multi-faceted, R01-funded research laboratory focusing on fibrosis in HCM. In summary, the
PI will utilize this K99/R00 award to establish a program aimed at uncovering new mechanisms of fibrosis in
HCM, and evaluate new therapeutic targets. This project will lay the groundwork to further our understanding of
the biology and therapeutic potential of natriuretic peptides as antifibrotic agents in HCM, and define the course
of the PI’s goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist."

 The objective of this study is to examine the validity of reflectance spectroscopy as a diagnostic tool for
objectively diagnosing bruising in infants and children. In cases of suspected child physical abuse, bruising is a
key clinical finding. The identification of bruising is extremely important, as it 1) triggers standard of care child
physical abuse medical evaluations in infants and young children; and 2) often forms the “reasonable
suspicion” basis for making reports to child protective services.
 Yet, the current clinical assessment of bruising in children is subjective and imprecise. One difficulty is that
bruising can be difficult to detect in children with darker skin tones, as melanin is a chromophore that can
obscure or distort characteristic color appearance of extravasated blood in the skin. Unfortunately, this clinical
imprecision has contributed to racial disproportionality of child physical abuse evaluations and reporting. The
current gold-standard of clinical bruising confirmation is time-dependent, i.e., serial evaluations of the lesion
that demonstrate color changes and disappearance of the lesion in a matter of weeks. In the suspected child
physical abuse scenario, the time-dependent confirmation of bruising is problematic, as decisions on whether
to undertake medical evaluations and/or make reports to child protective services require immediate, point-of-
care determinations.
 We propose that reflectance spectroscopy is an ideal candidate for this pediatric point-of-care tool because
it is painless, non-invasive, quickly utilized, and potentially scalable for widespread use in smartphone
cameras. The use of reflectance spectroscopy in other lines of clinical research—melanoma, neonatal
hyperbilirubinemia, and forensic dating of bruising--provide the scientific substrate for our novel and innovative
application of this technology. We propose that, irrespective of skin tone, reflectance spectroscopy will
demonstrate a reflectance pattern that is characteristic of traumatic bruising and is different from common
bruising mimics (i.e, birthmarks, vascular malformations, etc). Finally, we aim to utilize the patterns of
hemoglobin breakdown products to create a predictive model that identifies a bruise with high sensitivity and
specificity.
 We will utilize a multi-center approach to diversify our patient population and ensure sufficient patient
volumes, recruiting 260 children (ages 0-17 years) who have suspected bruising and common bruising mimics.
Using a laboratory-grade spectrometer, we will obtain spectral readings of both affected and adjacent
unaffected skin areas on all patients, controlling for skin tone. Spectral analysis will be performed using a least-
squares fitting method and Monte Carlo simulations will be used to help generate a predictive model. We
believe that, ultimately, the point-of-care use of reflectance spectroscopy will diminish unnecessary healthcare
utilization and racial disparities in child physical abuse evaluations and reporting."

Dr. Mark Arcario is a cardiothoracic anesthesiologist whose long-term goal is to be an independent physician-
scientist studying molecular mechanisms of allostery in ion channels. His research background is in
computational biophysics of membrane proteins with a focus on the effects of lipids and lipophiles on membrane
protein structure and function. He has a special interest in pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) and
mechanisms of anesthetic action. Several endogenous lipids, including neurosteroids, phospholipids, and fatty
acids, are strong allosteric modulators of pLGICs and it has been suggested that drugs, including anesthetics,
exploit these innate regulatory mechanisms. It is not well-known how lipophiles, which bind at the periphery of
the protein, alter channel function and equilibrium between functional states. Such a molecular mechanism is
essential for the rational, structure-based design of new drugs targeting this family of channels. To address this
knowledge gap, the candidate will use a combination of innovative molecular dynamics (MD) techniques to
characterize state-dependent structural ensembles of prokaryotic pLGIC, ELIC (Erwinia ligand-gated ion
channel), and the human 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). Aim 1 will determine how the conformation
of the lipid-facing, fourth transmembrane (M4) helix varies with the functional state of the channel (i.e., resting,
activated, desensitized), using computational electrophysiology methods. Aim 2 will characterize the binding site
of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a polyunsaturated fatty acid, and how binding of DHA causes inhibition using
multiscale simulation and free energy calculations. This work will yield novel insight into state-dependent
dynamics of pLGICs as well as establish a molecular model of lipophilic allosteric modulation. This research will
be conducted under Dr. Wayland Cheng, an expert in pLGIC structure and function with a focus on lipid binding
and modulation, along with co-mentor, Dr. Grace Brannigan, an expert in computational biophysics with a focus
on MD method development and application to membrane proteins. An advisory committee comprised of Dr.
Alex Evers, an expert in anesthetic pharmacology, Dr. Baron Chanda, an expert in ion channel thermodynamics
and gating, and Dr. Jerome Hénin, an expert in free energy calculations, will aid in the scientific development of
the candidate. The research plan will allow the candidate to develop skills in free energy calculations and
computational electrophysiology, which will prepare him for a career in computational biophysics of ion channels.
In addition, involvement in career development activities during this award will prepare the candidate for
independence by the end of the award. The Department of Anesthesiology at Washington University in St. Louis,
a leader in academic anesthesiology, provides an excellent and supportive environment for ion channel research
and development of physician-scientists."

 Axonal degeneration within the corticospinal tract leads to several neurological diseases, including
hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs), which are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of gait
disorders characterized by poor balance, spasticity, and progressive muscle weakness that can ultimately result
in paralysis. Leveraging parallel animal (rat) and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based models, our goal is
to develop a better understanding of the pathomechanisms that underlie neurodegeneration resulting from
mutations in genes that cause HSP, with a longer term goal of using these models as platforms to identify new
therapeutics to combat disease. Using CRISPR-mediated genome editing, we have developed physiologically
relevant models that recapitulate phenotypes exhibited by patients suffering from HSP. Specifically, CRISPR-
modified rats expressing pathological variants of SPG4 (spastin) and SPG57 (TFG) demonstrate early onset
hind limb spasticity and ataxia, which rapidly progresses to hind limb paralysis. Other rat models, including those
harboring a truncation of SPG80 (UBAP1) identified previously in patients, exhibit later onset disease phenotypes,
enabling us to examine disease progression in multiple, unique contexts. We now have an unprecedented
opportunity to determine the mechanistic basis of the axonopathies observed. In particular, we plan to use high-
resolution, live cell confocal imaging and electron tomography to test the hypothesis that changes in the
trafficking of specific factors, including neurofilament proteins implicated previously in neurodegenerative
disease, contribute to impaired neuronal function in HSP. We will also determine how neurofilament trafficking
defects observed relate to disease onset based on a combination of electromyography studies, histopathology,
and comprehensive gait and kinematic analysis of rodent movement as spasticity and muscle weakness ensues.
Furthermore, we will determine mechanisms by which mutations that underlie HSP impact neuronal excitability,
again using live cell imaging approaches, but also in vitro biochemistry and genetic studies. Collectively, this
work will help to uncover several of the mechanisms that contribute to neuronal dysfunction observed in patients
with HSP and lay the foundation for the future development of drug screening approaches."
10824253,"The research proposed in this MIRA renewal application seeks to understand mechanisms of transmembrane
signaling by members of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) superfamily – and other receptor-like kinases –
that do not fit the ‘rules’ that explain most RTKs. Non-canonical receptors in this group play important roles in
human disease – from neurodevelopmental disorders, to bone diseases, cancers, and congenital
malformations. The traditional model for RTK signaling involves ligand-induced receptor dimerization, which
promotes tyrosine autophosphorylation of the receptor and recruitment of downstream signaling molecules. As
we understand more about the 58 human RTKs, it has become clear that this mechanism only applies to about
half of them. For example, 10% of human RTKs are linked to WNT signaling, and must function differently
because their intracellular regions often have only catalytically inactive ‘pseudokinase’ domains. Still other
RTKs (such as ALK) have unique extracellular regions for which ligand binding and receptor regulation are
poorly understood. We have made significant progress in understanding extracellular and intracellular
structures of WNT-regulated pseudokinase RTKs. Their extracellular WNT-binding modules differ significantly
from their counterparts in proteins involved in ‘canonical’ WNT signaling, in ways that suggest well-defined
hypotheses for how these RTKs might participate as co-receptors with Frizzled receptors in b-catenin
independent WNT signaling. The intracellular pseudokinase domains of the RTKs structurally resemble the
insulin receptor kinase in its ‘inactive’ conformation, and analysis of their structural dynamics suggests that
they can undergo the same ‘inactive-like’ to ‘active-like’ conformational transitions seen for normal tyrosine
kinase domains. Indeed, we have found that these transitions can be promoted by small molecule kinase
inhibitor-like molecules, despite the fact that the isolated pseudokinase domains do not bind ATP. In the next
5-10 years of this project, we propose to test hypotheses for WNT-induced assembly of receptor complexes
that incorporate pseudokinase RTKs, elucidate their specific WNT dependence and reliance on WNT acylation,
gain high resolution structural views through crystallography and EM, and analyze their signaling properties.
We will test hypotheses for how the pseudokinase domains contribute to signaling – either by acquiring kinase
activity or by functioning as allosterically switchable interaction platforms, with precedents in other
pseudokinases and in catalytically active kinases such as Aurora A. In parallel with these efforts, we will
investigate new opportunities for therapeutic targeting of pseudokinase RTKs such as PTK7, ROR1, ROR2,
and RYK, which have all been implicated in numerous diseases. Together, these studies will provide important
new insight into signaling by receptors that do not fit normal paradigms for RTKs or WNT receptors. The new
lessons should also be applicable to other classes of receptor-like kinases implicated in disease, opening new
avenues for potential therapeutic inhibition."
10824254,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
 Cervical cancer mortality is expected to increase by 42% to 442,926 deaths worldwide by 2030. Currently
85% of incident cervical cancers and 87% of cervical cancer deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries
(LMIC). Due in large part to the low utilization of cervical cancer screening services, Senegal ranks 17th in the
world for cervical cancer incidence. For women ages 40 to 49 in rural regions of the country the cervical cancer
screening rate is very low at less than 2%. As a result women often present with mostly preventable late stage
cancers. Secondary prevention programs (cervical cancer screening) are critical to effectively achieving global
progress toward the elimination of human papillomavirus related cancers. However, considerable context
variation across geographic- and health system-levels in LMICs markedly obstructs the community
responsiveness of an implemented program. Lessons learned from higher resource countries show that
incidence and mortality rates decline and early deaths are prevented with early detection and appropriate follow-
up and treatment. Prior efforts and pilot studies in Senegal show that there is slow uptake, poor follow-up, and
low treatment rates for women who are screened positive.
 Patient navigation is a strategy to eliminate barriers to screening, timely diagnosis, and follow-up to
improve cancer outcomes in vulnerable populations. In high-income countries, patient navigation has
demonstrated considerable effectiveness in its ability to address communication, information, medical system,
and emotional barriers to timely care across all phases of the cancer care continuum, including detection,
diagnosis, treatment, and post-treatment quality of life. Patient navigation programs enhance access to care,
promote self-efficacy, and sustain patient engagement with care, and have been shown to improve cancer
outcomes, particularly among marginalized groups, rural populations, and impoverished communities.
 The goal of this project is to prevent unnecessary deaths due to cervical cancer in Senegal. This mixed
methods research responds to identified intrapersonal- and community-level barriers to early cervical cancer
screening uptake, follow-up, and treatment among women there. We will apply the Dynamic Adaptation Process
to study the adaptation of an evidence-based cervical cancer patient navigation program in urban and rural
contexts of Senegal, measure the intervention effectiveness, and evaluate programmatic implementation
outcomes. By studying the process of adaptation of a patient navigation program in a low- and middle-income
country, we will apply implementation science to a novel context. With a particular focus on how the adaptation
responds to cancer-related stigma and women’s autonomy in healthcare decision-making, our project
demonstrates additional innovation. The process knowledge generated will further our long-term goal to inform
the national cervical cancer prevention and control programs in Senegal and other low- and middle-income
countries."
10824382,"SUMMARY
IgE-mediated food allergy is a common disease affecting approximately 1 in 13 children in the USA. For many,
this is a lifelong disease with significant impairment in quality of life and no FDA-approved treatment. Although
IgE is central to the pathophysiology of food allergy, the maintenance of IgE is poorly understood and is key to
developing treatments that are truly disease modifying. We have shown that maintenance of IgE in mice requires
IL-4 production from CD4+ T cells, and blocking IL-4/13 signaling in humans demonstrates that IgE requires
continual Th2 cytokine production for maintenance. IgE memory in mice is contained within a population of
antigen-specific IgG+ memory cells that continually renew the short-lived IgE+ plasma cell pool with T cell help.
There is a lack of corresponding information on the cellular basis of IgE production in humans. We hypothesize
that memory IgG+ B cells are the main B cell subset in humans from which allergen-specific IgE is derived under
control of T cell help. We have identified significant heterogeneity in Th2 cytokine producing CD4+ T cells from
food allergic individuals, including conventional Th2 cells, pathogenic effector Th2 cells (peTh2), and T follicular
helper type-2 (Tfh2) cells. We propose that peTh2 cells are enriched in intestinal tissues where they can support
class-switch to IgE from allergen-specific IgG memory B cells. We propose that Tfh2 cells are enriched in
mucosal lymphoid tissues (tonsils) where they support class switch from naïve and memory B cells, with the
latter being the source of high-affinity IgE. Furthermore, we propose that CD27+ conventional Th2 cells are a
reservoir of memory that maintain the pool of Tfh2 and peTh2 cells through local cues in the lymphoid tissues
and mucosa, respectively. In this multi-PI proposal bringing together T cell and B cell expertise in food allergy,
we will test these stated hypotheses using tonsil, gastrointestinal biopsies, and blood from patients with IgE-
mediated food allergy. Understanding the maintenance and function of CD4+ Th2 subsets in the context of IgE-
mediated food allergy will allow us to design disease modifying immunotherapies for the treatment of food allergy."
10824384,"Post-resection prognostication for oral cavity cancers (OCC) is qualitative and potentially ambiguous. A
significant subset (25-37%) of Stage I/II patients still develop local recurrence after treatment with surgery alone.
The long-term goal of this proposal will be to create a Quantitative Risk Model (QRM) using machine learning
and artificial intelligence to predict recurrence risk for Stage I/II patients using image-based biomarkers of
aggression. The objective is to develop and validate state-of-the-art systems for biomarker imaging,
quantification, and modeling to accurately predict risk of recurrence in cancer patients based on image analytics.
The central hypothesis is that a quantitative, artificial intelligence approach to pathology will result in significantly
greater prognostic value compared with manual microscope-based analysis. The rationale for this work is that
tumor aggression can be predicted from patterns present in pathology images, given the existence of histological
risk models that have been clinically validated in the past; however, these risk models are not in widespread use
because they are less accurate, robust, and transportable to the larger community of pathologists. This proposal
will test the central hypothesis through three specific aims: (1) Develop an analysis pipeline that can accurately
predict recurrence risk for Stage I/II OCC patients and identify treatment targets (e.g. adaptive local immune
response and angiogenesis); (2) Demonstrate robust performance across a multi-site data cohort collected from
seven national and international centers; and (3) Distil the results of QRM analysis to synoptic pathology
reporting, demonstrating the ability of QRM to interface with standard clinical reporting tools. The innovation for
addressing these aims comes from a unique application of active learning for training artificial intelligence to
recognize tissue structures, new features for quantifying tissue architecture based on the interface between
tumor and host, and a novel approach for large cross-site validation. Moreover, this proposal develops a unique
mapping between computational pathology and commonly-used synoptic reporting variables, enabling rapid
uptake of this work into existing clinical workflows. This research is significant because it provides personalized
outcome predictions for a niche group of undertreated patients with limited options and can serve as the
foundation for designing future clinical trials through identification of treatment targets. Multi-site training and
evaluation, combined with AI-to-report mapping, will be broadly applicable to a large group of computational
approaches, bridging the gap between engineering research labs and clinical application. The expected outcome
of this work is a trained model for predicting Stage I/II OCC recurrence, identification of treatment targets, and
mapping to synoptic reports, as well as a broadly-applicable workflow for the broader computational pathology
community. This project will have a large positive impact on patients and surgical pathologists by enabling rapid,
accurate prognosis and directed treatment plans in an easy-to-use pipeline that integrates seamlessly into
existing clinical workflows."
10824365,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)-Ca2+ signaling is activated following stimulation of growth
factor receptors, antigen receptors, and G protein-coupled receptors by ligands including neurotransmitters and
histamine. The activation of phospholipase C triggers hydrolysis of the PIP2 lipid at the plasma membrane (PM)
to generate diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 subsequently releases Ca2+ stored in the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to activate cytosolic Ca2+ effectors for downstream signaling events such as
secretion, proliferation, and migration. The consumed PM PIP2 and ER Ca2+ must be quickly restored to sustain
signaling responses and to maintain cellular homeostasis. This homeostatic regulation of PIP2-Ca2+ signaling
requires transport of phosphatidylinositol (PI) from the ER to the PM for PIP2 resynthesis and store-operated
Ca2+ entry (SOCE) that activates Ca2+ influx to refill the ER Ca2+ store. SOCE has been studied extensively;
however, the mechanisms underlying PIP2 replenishment during PIP2-Ca2+ signaling are not well understood.
Recently, we and others discovered the lipid transfer protein Nir2 that localizes at ER-PM junctions, where the
ER is in contact with the PM, to mediate PM PIP2 replenishment. The objective of this proposal is to define the
mechanisms regulating PIP2 replenishment by Nir2 at ER-PM junctions during receptor-induced Ca2+ signaling.
Our preliminary studies identified Nir1, an Nir protein lacking a lipid transfer protein domain, as a binding partner
and positive regulator of Nir2 at ER-PM junctions. In addition, our recent data revealed that the membrane-
shaping hairpin sequence present in all extended synaptotagmins (E-Syts) is important for regulating PIP2
replenishment at ER-PM junctions. Moreover, we found that conversion of DAG into phosphatidic acid (PA) by
DAG kinases (DGKs) is crucial for Nir2 localization at ER-PM junctions. Among the ten DGKs in mammalian
cells, the epsilon-isoform of DGK (DGKε) is recently shown to localize at ER-PM junctions. Our central hypothesis
is that PM PIP2 replenishment during receptor-induced Ca2+ signaling is mediated by the oligomers of Nir1 and
Nir2 formed following PA production from DAG by DGKε at ER-PM junctions shaped by E-Syts. We propose
three specific aims to test our central hypothesis using biochemical analysis and advanced imaging techniques
to determine the mechanisms by which Nir1, E-Syts and DGKε regulate PIP2 replenishment. We expect that
successfully completion of the proposed studies will establish the molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating
PIP2 replenishment following hydrolysis induced by receptor stimulation. Restoring PM PIP2 is critical to sustain
Ca2+ signaling and maintain PM PIP2 levels critical to membrane trafficking, cytoskeletal dynamics, and ion
transport in receptor-stimulated cells. Mutations in Nir1 are linked to retinal dystrophy and patients with mutations
in DGKε suffer from renal failure. Our proposed studies may provide knowledge for developing therapeutic
strategies to treat patients affected by these diseases."
10824851,"Human memory B and T cells (Bmem, Tmem) can be found in circulation and residing in lymphoid and non-
lymphoid tissues. After infection and vaccination, we can follow antigen (Ag)-specific phenotypically-defined
memory cells in blood, but we can't easily track Ag-specific clones of memory cells in blood over time and the
cells are lost to us if they leave circulation and move into tissues. Our knowledge of the antigen (Ag)-specific
Tmem and Bmem compartments in tissues, particularly non-lymphoid tissues, has been largely limited to single
timepoint analyses. While we have learned much about the human immune system from these static and serial
approaches, at the end of the day, these analyses still only provide us with “immune snapshots” of the Ag-specific
memory clones and tissue resident memory cells. This limits us from asking key questions such as which signals
facilitate or prevent the recruitment, retention, and survival of specific populations of tissue resident human
memory cells. We are also unable to precisely measure the evolution of Ag-specific clones over time or assess
whether microenvironment or immune perturbations influences the evolution and durability of these clones of
cells. This knowledge gap is the basis for the Cooperative Centers in Human Immunology (CCHI) U19 application
entitled “Evolution and Durability of Human T and B cell Responses”. The goal of this Program is to address the
knowledge gap by leveraging our access to samples from organ transplant recipients to: (i) monitor cellular
trafficking of memory cells from circulation into tissues over time; (ii) study the evolution of memory cells that
reside in the tissue or respond to tissue specific Ags; and (iii) assess the durability of these memory populations
over time and in response to changes in the environment. The central hypothesis addressed in this program is
that the human immune memory compartment is constantly evolving in response to local and systemic signals
that influence both the durability and reactivity profile of these cells. We will address this hypothesis in three
research Projects that are supported by three scientific service Cores. Project 1 will address the factors that
control the evolution and durability of memory B cells and antibody secreting cells that contribute to organ failure
and rejection in kidney transplant patients. Project 2 will study the generation and durability of memory T cells
that reside in the endometrium of uterus transplant patients. Project 3 will assess B cell and antibody responses
in lung transplants. The three science service Cores will support the overarching goals of the Program and will
provide the individual projects with the tools needed to track and analyze memory T cells, memory B cells and
antibodies. We believe that the studies in this Proposal are important because they are designed to address
fundamental questions about the generation, evolution and durability of human memory B and T cells. In the
future, these data may be used to develop immune-modulating modalities that can be used to appropriately tune
protective and damaging memory cell-driven immune responses."

Memory T cells play a key role in allograft rejection. They represent a sizeable proportion of the
alloreactive T cell repertoire and are superior to naive T cells in driving the effector mechanisms
of acute and chronic rejection.
Much of the research on immune memory in transplantation has focused on circulating effector
(TEM) and central (TCM) memory T cells. Recent studies have identified large populations of non-
circulating, resident memory T cells (TRM) that provide local immunity in non-lymphoid tissues
and are phenotypically, transcriptionally, and functionally distinct from TEM and TCM. TRM-
phenotype cells have been identified in human small bowel and lung allografts but their biology
and function in transplantation are poorly understood.
During the past funding period, we established a mouse kidney transplantation model in which
allografts undergo slow, chronic rejection, and monoclonal and polyclonal T cells that infiltrate the
graft can be tracked and interrogated over time. Using this model, we could show that TRM
(defined by their phenotype, transcriptional profile, non-circulatory behavior, and function) form in
the graft and contribute to rejection. This led to the central thesis that TRM are maintained locally
and sustain rejection locally. In this application we propose to investigate how TRM are maintained
in the allograft. In Aim 1, we will investigate the roles of antigen, dendritic cells, and the cytokine
IL-15. In Aim 2, we will investigate the role of a specific transcriptional and post-transcriptional
regulator (Ebp1), identified by single cell transcriptional analysis, that enhances cell proliferation
and survival. In both aims we will study the effects of interrupting TRM maintenance on chronic
rejection. Answering these questions promises to yield novel biological and therapeutic insights
applicable to organ transplant rejection and possibly other diseases such as GVHD and
autoimmunity."
10825562,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory autoimmune disease affecting 1% of the
population. Aggressive treatment is a fundamental therapeutic strategy to improve disease-related
outcomes and cardiovascular disease, which contributes to excess mortality in RA. Thus, therapeutics
targeting novel pathways that treat RA and reduce cardiovascular risk are needed. A potential target is
blocking the proinflammatory, immunogenic, and proatherogenic consequences of isolevuglandins
(isoLGs).
 IsoLGs are highly reactive dicarbonyl products of oxidative stress that bind covalently to proteins
causing conformational changes rendering them immunogenic and proinflammatory. Two decades of
work at Vanderbilt led to the identification of 2-hydroxybenzylamine (2-HOBA) as a highly effective
scavenger of reactive dicarbonyls such as isoLGs. Scavenging reactive dicarbonyls is preferable to using
antioxidants because reactive oxygen species are necessary for normal cellular function. In animal models
of autoimmunity, hypertension, and atherosclerosis 2-HOBA reduced inflammation, autoantibodies,
blood pressure, and atherosclerosis, and in human phase 1 clinical studies in healthy volunteers 2-HOBA
was well tolerated.
 We propose a phase 2 study to determine 2-HOBA’s tolerability, safety, and effect on isoLG-
adducts, inflammation and blood pressure in RA patients. Twenty-eight subjects will be randomized to
750mg 2-HOBA or matching placebo three times a day for 12 weeks (14 per group). A visit at week 16 will
assess for persisting effects after a 4-week washout. Aim 1 will compare tolerability and adverse events
in active and placebo arms. Aim 2 will compare changes in cellular and plasma isoLG-adducts, markers of
inflammation, DAS28 score, and 24-hour blood pressure in active and placebo arms. This pilot study will
inform the feasibility and design of future studies to examine the efficacy of 2-HOBA in RA patients."

 Anne E. Fehrenbacher, PhD, MPH is a social epidemiologist in the Department of Psychiatry and
Biobehavioral Sciences at the University of California, Los Angeles and a Fogary GloCal Fellow at the Public
Health Research Institute of India. Dr. Fehrenbacher’s long-term career goal is to become an independent
investigator with expertise in implementation science for HIV interventions with stigmatized populations. The
proposed K01 research and training plan will provide Dr. Fehrenbacher with the methodological and practical
skills to meet this goal. The present study will evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and sustainability of an
adapted WHO E-PrEP Implementation Tool to increase PrEP uptake, retention, and adherence.
 Dr. Fehrenbacher’s research plan will address three specific aims guided by the EPIS Framework of
Implementation Science: 1) to model barriers and facilitators at the policy, structural, and organizational levels
for adopting the WHO E-PrEP Implementation Tool to support PrEP rollout in targeted interventions in India; 2)
to assess patient and provider preferences for bundled intervention components to inform the adaptation,
localization, and tailoring of the WHO E-PrEP Implementation Tool; and 3) to evaluate the acceptability,
feasibility, and sustainability of the adapted WHO E-PrEP Implementation Tool. The first aim will be addressed
through concept mapping and bottleneck analysis with policymakers, health officials, and targeted intervention
staff to visualize stakeholder priorities for PrEP implementation. The second aim will be addressed using
conjoint analysis experiments conducted with patients and providers assessing bundled intervention attributes
to elucidate the relative importance of each attribute on the likelihood of successful implementation. The third
aim will involve a pilot cluster randomized controlled trial to evaluate implementation processes and outcomes
along the HIV prevention continuum for testing, linkage, PrEP uptake, retention, and adherence.
 Dr. Fehrenbacher’s training objectives correspond with each of these specific aims, as follows: 1) to
gain expertise in implementation science methods; 2) to gain expertise in the design and adaptation of eHealth
interventions; and 3) to gain expertise in monitoring and evaluation of longitudinal interventions. The findings
from this implementation science study will aid in the scale-up of sustainable biobehavioral interventions to
reduce HIV disparities among stigmatized groups across India."
10825598,"Measles is increasing as a cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Measles virus (MeV), the causative
agent of measles, is spread by the respiratory route and is one of the most highly infectious viruses of humans
with an estimated basic reproductive rate (R0) of 12-18 that drives the need for high levels of population
immunity to prevent outbreaks. Measles is a human disease, but macaques can contract measles through
contact with humans, develop disease that mimics human measles and have been effectively used for studies
of measles pathogenesis. Understanding the extremely efficient airborne transmission of MeV requires
knowledge of both the initiation of infection after viral aerosol or droplet contact with the respiratory tract and
mechanisms of virus control and release. Respiratory epithelial cells were long assumed to be the first site of
MeV infection with subsequent spread to lymphoid tissue. However, investigators using enhanced green
fluorescent protein (eGFP)-expressing recombinant reporter MeVs were not able to detect infected respiratory
epithelial cells early after infection of macaques or to demonstrate infection from the apical surface of
differentiated respiratory epithelial cells in culture and deduced that they had not become infected. Because
eGFP-expressing cells were observed after basal infection of cultured epithelial cells, an alternate view
emerged that lung epithelial cell infection is initiated through basolateral exposure to infected lymphocytes and
does not occur until after the viremia is established. These latter studies have concluded that myeloid cells
rather than epithelial cells are the initial sites of MeV infection in the lung. However, our data show that apical
infection of respiratory epithelial cells is actually quite efficient, but exposure to MeV induces shedding of MeV-
producing multinucleated giant cells from the epithelial surface and leaves it without detectable infected cells.
Therefore, epithelial cells may be important for the initiation as well as dissemination of MeV infection.
Identification of the susceptible cells in the respiratory tract that allow for very efficient initiation of infection and
determination of the mechanism of MeV entry into differentiated epithelial cells are key to understanding
efficient MeV transmission and use aerosolized vaccine for measles immunization. To address this critical area
we will use in vitro and in vivo studies of rhesus macaques to identify the mechanisms by which both wild type
and vaccine strains of MeV infect primary differentiated respiratory tract epithelial cells through the following
specific aims: (1) Determine the relative susceptibility to infection with MeV of primary alveolar macrophages
and cultures of differentiated cells from the upper and lower respiratory tract that include lung fibroblasts,
dendritic cells and basal, ciliated and mucous-producing epithelial cells. (2) Determine the host receptors used
and mechanisms by which MeV infects and induces shedding of primary differentiated respiratory epithelial
cells after interaction at the apical surface. (3) Identify the innate responses of differentiated respiratory
epithelial cells to MeV infection and their role(s) in restricting virus replication.

10825601,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Most adult tissues are maintained by resident adult stem cells that maintain the function and integrity of the
tissue. As old cells die or are damaged, new cells are produced from adult stem cells. In many tissues there is
emerging data suggesting the presence of both rapid-cycling and quiescent stem cells. Rapid cycling cells are
actively engaged in tissue repair while slow-cycling, or G0-arrested cells, are reserve cells. Recently published
work, and preliminary studies in this proposal, support the hypothesis that spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) in
the testis are heterogeneous in their cycling status and that disruption of the normal cell cycle can interfere with
both self-renewal and differentiation. We have identified a subpopulation of spermatogonia that express EOMES,
a T box transcription factor. Using lineage tracing we have shown that they contribute to steady-state
spermatogenesis and to regeneration following germ cell ablation by busulfan. In Plzf mutant mice, which show
an age-dependent depletion of SSCs, EOMES+ cells cycle more rapidly, suggesting that age-dependent
depletion of SSCs is caused by proliferative exhaustion. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that
spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) are also heterogeneous with respect to their cycling status and that there are
both rapid cycling and slow cycling SSCs. We propose that proper regulation of the cell cycle is critical for
maintaining the homeostatic balance between self-renewal and differentiation and that loss of cell cycle
regulation can lead to age-dependent loss of SSCs due to the mis-regulation of critical self-renewal genes. In
Specific Aim 1 we will quantify the frequency of cell cycle asynchrony, the concordance of SSC marker
expression and cycling status, and the effect of mutation of Plzf on both of these parameters. In Specific Aim 2
we will utilize an allele of Ki67 (Mki67-RFP) to flow sort cycling and non-cycling cells from the larger pool of
GFRA1+ population. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), and single nuclei Assay for Transposase
Accessible Chromatin (snATACseq) of the cycling and non-cycling cells will provide and independent
assessment of the non-cycling G0 population of SSCs, whether Eomes and other markers of SSCs cells are
enriched within the population, and whether there is a previously unidentified population of G0 cells within the
SSC pool. Lastly, In Specific Aim 3 we will assess how mutation of Batf, a regulator of Eomes expression,
enhances the germ cell loss phenotype in Plzf lu/lu mutants, and assess the role of the mis-regulation of cell cycle
genes in the driving the hyperproliferative phenotype."
10825609,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We are entering a post antibiotic world where understanding the mechanism of an antibacterial strategy is not
sufficient to ensure an effective therapy. We must also consider the mechanisms of resistance and address them
during the design process. We will use genetics and proteomics to discover how bacteria combat bacteriophage
(phage) lysis. Driving this goal is the desire to combat phage resistance mechanisms so as to make bacteria
more susceptible to phage predation. We first tackle the problem by employing state of the art genetic methods
to interrogate the role of essential genes in limiting phage replication and bacterial lysis. Using CRISPR
transcriptional interference (CRISPRi), we will conduct the first studies in the human pathogen Pseudomonas
aeruginosa to determine whether partial knockdown of essential genes can positively impact phage replication.
We hypothesize that inhibition of certain essential genes will not only limit bacterial fitness, but also has the
potential to enhance the success of any phage-host pairing, regardless of whether the a priori state is one of
phage resistance or sensitivity. Put another way, even phages that already replicate in a given host can do better.
We will additionally harness the ease of CRISPRi screening to identify non-essential genes that limit phage
replication in strain-dependent manners, more akin to canonical hypervariable immune systems (e.g. CRISPR).
To further our understanding of the physical underpinnings of phage resistance, we will create a physical map
of phage-host protein-protein interactions using whole cell fractionation proteomics. This is particularly critical as
many phage proteins are of unknown function and is in line with our goal of identifying essential protein
complexes interacting with phage factors. We will validate the importance of factors identified from genetic and
proteomic assays with phage replication assays during single gene knockdown to assess generalities of
phenomena observed. Lastly, we suspect that phage “accessory genes” (i.e. hypervariable loci not strictly
essential for phage replication in all hosts) represent a treasure trove of inhibitors and modulators of host
processes, which could be useful genetic fodder for enhancing future phage therapeutics. Accessory genes have
been bioinformatically identified and host binding partners will be identified with conventional affinity purification-
mass spectrometry, and validated with phage replication assays. Our research strategy combines the
complementary expertise of three investigators: Joseph Bondy-Denomy, an expert in phage biology and bacterial
immune systems; and Danielle Swaney, an expert in bioanalytical mass spectrometry who has used her skills to
define the host-pathogen protein-protein network for many human pathogens; and Jason Peters, a microbiologist
with expertise in bacterial genetics and pathogenesis."
10825619,"Summary
Neurons encode a wide variety of signals, each with specific relevance for translating a sensory response or
memory into behavior. How are cells and synapses optimized to meet these needs? Our work has used in
vitro model systems to understand such specializations of function at the level of the dendrite, the axon initial
segment and the nerve terminal. The lab's studies have stretched the classical views of neuronal function, for
example by showing how neurotransmitter receptors in the axon initial segment and in the nerve terminal have
unique roles for modifying axon and synaptic communication. In this proposal, we will turn to a new view of the
role of the axon. Beyond its function in the one-way transmission of spikes, we will examine how subthreshold
signals generated in the soma, the axon or the terminal spread along the axon in the forward and reverse
directions to modify the spike and its propagation. Additionally, we will examine how calcium release
mechanism modulate excitation in neonatal brain. Key to these aims will be the use of carefully selected
mouse lines that feature sparse fluorescent labeling of neurons with fluorophores that clearly reveal each
compartment of the neuron in living brain slices, from dendrite to nerve terminal. The research should reveal
new dimensions of signaling that operate in parallel with the action potential, particularly in interneurons in
neural microcircuits"

The North Carolina Diabetes Research Center (NCDRC) seeks to provide research support to explore feasibility
of concepts related to the NCDRC’s goals, and to provide a mechanism to generate sufficient preliminary data
to pursue competitive funding mechanisms. We will support Pilot and Feasibility (P&F) studies that are aligned
with the Center’s mission of connecting promising investigators with resources that are novel and not generally
widely available, and connect individuals new to diabetes research with the expertise and resources needed to

The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma and its premalignant metaplastic precursor Barrett's esophagus
(BE) have both displayed marked increases in incidence in the US in recent decades. The progression to
esophageal adenocarcinoma occurs through a transformation in which non-dysplastic BE becomes dysplastic
BE and acquires the earliest histological features of cancer. Currently, we do not know the molecular drivers of
this transition and how it occurs in human patients. The primary objective of this proposal is to identify the earliest
events underlying the transition to dysplasia as these will yield new therapeutic and diagnostic targets. Our
proposal leverages technological advances in single-cell biology using mitochondrial mutation lineage tracing
combined with RNA-sequencing to track clonality and RNA profiles in single cells. Our preliminary data
demonstrates the technological approach and reveals that non-dysplastic BE emerges through multiple clones
that can generate all BE cell types. However, our preliminary data from dysplastic BE revealed the opposite
result. Dysplasia emerged from non-dysplasia BE through a single clone with a distinguishing transcriptional
profile. Using our single-cell and clonal tracking data, we identified the Wnt pathway, including Wnt genes LGR5,
NOTUM, and DKK1, as differentially expressed in dysplasia. Further supporting the Wnt pathway, we also
uncovered an APC mutation occurring in the same sample. Thus, our central hypothesis is that the
transformation from non-dysplastic to dysplastic Barrett's esophagus emerges from a single clone with genetic
and transcriptional changes that can be tracked to identify new targets for dysplasia. To test this hypothesis, we
will implement a comprehensive and rigorous experimental approach that couples single-cell RNA-Seq,
mitochondrial mutation-based lineage tracing, and 3D organoids for functional investigation into the mechanisms
of dysplasia. The proposed studies will leverage these techniques to track the clonal evolution and RNA profiles
of single cells in non-dysplasia and dysplastic BE (Aim 1) and to provide mechanistic exploration into the role of
the Wnt pathway in the emergence of dysplasia (Aim 2). This study leverages the research team's diverse and
complementary expertise in cancer single cell genomics and bioinformatics, clinical and basic approaches to BE,
and in vitro epithelial model systems to develop a robust platform for tracking cell fate in human tissues that will
provide unprecedented molecular insight into the development of dysplasia in BE. Our expected outcomes are
a molecular characterization of the earliest changes underlying the transformation to dysplasia in BE. Our work
will have broad positive impact as it will reveal both therapeutic targets as well as diagnostic markers for patients
with BE who will progress to esophageal adenocarcinoma. This work ultimately aims to dramatically decrease
the number of patients who are diagnosed with late-stage esophageal adenocarcinoma by identifying and
targeting these early lesions before progression."

in the same location, and one day prior to the start of the annual to the American Society of
Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) and Center for International Blood and Marrow

Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (PTCTC) Late-Effects and Graft-versus-Host Disease
strategy groups. Prior to the conference four working comittees have been formed to develop key
topics for long-term survivors with cGVHD: 1) Phases of cGVHD, 2) Organ Dysfunction and
Immunity, 3) Metabolism, Growth and Development, and 4) Patient Important Outcomes. Each
working group is co-lead by a member with expertise in GVHD and a member with expertise in
survivorship, and includes 5-7 additional members. Meticulous attention has been paid to ensure
the composition of working committees represents experts with diverse backgrounds based on
several criteria including: career stage, race, gender, and ethnicity, geographic location across
the United States and Canada, HCT program size (i.e. how many HCTs are performed each year,
is the program part of a single health system or a standalone children’s hospital), and credentials
(e.g. inclusion of pharmacists, psychologists, nurses, physician assistants, physicians, physical
therapist). Working group diversity also encompasses experts in research and clinical care to
promote both advances in clinical care that could be adapted quickly and broad research
questions that could be addressed through collaborations in these groups. The working
committees will present their preliminary findings at the consensus conference which will then be
followed by a forum for open discussion. Finally, manuscripts from each working group will be
submitted for peer-reviewed publication and dissemination throughout the HCT Community."

NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) is a critical component of the
innate immune system that forms the NLRP3 inflammasome, an intracellular molecular platform
that drives caspase-1 activation and the secretion of biologically active IL-1β and IL-18. In addition
to its protective role in innate immunity, aberrant activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome
contributes to the pathogenesis of several inherited and acquired inflammatory disorders, such
as Cryopyrin-associated autoinflammatory syndrome, gout, Crohn's disease, Alzheimer's
disease, diabetes and atherosclerosis. Despite extensive investigation, the molecular mechanism
leading to NLRP3 inflammasome activation remains elusive. Recently, the protein kinase Nek7
has been found to mediate NLRP3 inflammasome activation independently of its kinase activity.
However, it is unknown how Nek7 is mechanistically linked to NLRP3 inflammasome activation.
Our recent studies implicate a critical role for Nek7 phosphorylation in NLRP3 inflammasome
activation. In this application we aim to elucidate the molecular mechanism of Nek7-mediated
NLRP3 inflammasome activation and determine the role of a novel regulator in this pathway. Our
results are expected to provide new mechanistic insights into NLRP3 inflammasome activation
and might guide the development of novel therapeutic strategies for treating NLRP3-driven
inflammatory diseases."

Liver cancer remains one of the most lethal cancers worldwide, second only to pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC), with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) making up at least 85% of liver cancer cases.
The most effective treatment options for HCC are for early- to intermediate-stage HCC. Unfortunately, due to the
absence of signs and symptoms in the early stages, most HCC patients are not diagnosed until advanced-stage
of disease, and therefore can only be treated with systemic therapies. First-line therapy for advanced HCC was
recently updated to a combination treatment of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, and while this update is
encouraging, progression-free survival currently remains around 7 months. Thus, more effective strategies to
treat advanced HCC are still desperately needed. Our lab recently identified an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)
that targets glucose metabolism through alternative splicing of pyruvate kinase (PKM) pre-mRNA, which could
be used as a therapy to treat HCC. PKM pre-mRNA undergoes mutually exclusive alternative splicing that results
in expression of either the PKM1 or PKM2 isoform. PKM2 is well known to be preferentially upregulated in HCC.
Its low enzymatic activity can create a bottleneck at the end of glycolysis that potentially promotes tumor growth
by shunting upstream glycolytic intermediates into various biosynthesis pathways. Given that PKM1 has higher
enzymatic activity, our ASO-based PKM splice-switching (APSS) therapy is designed to redirect alternative
splicing from PKM2 to PKM1, thereby relieving the PKM2-induced bottleneck, and reducing the accumulation of
glycolytic intermediates. Currently, our therapy has achieved reduced tumor growth in two pre-clinical models of
HCC. Despite these promising results, we have yet to establish a precise metabolic explanation by which APSS
therapy results in reduced HCC growth, as well as to evaluate its efficacy in combination with current HCC
therapies. My hypothesis is that our APSS therapy reduces serine synthesis in HCC and promotes dependence
on extracellular serine to sustain production of purine nucleotides. Additionally, I hypothesize that combination
treatment of APSS therapy with sorafenib will re-sensitize sorafenib-resistant HCC tumors. I plan to utilize in vivo
stable isotope tracing with LC-MS in HCC xenografts in order to obtain a comprehensive profile of HCC
metabolism in response to APSS therapy. Additionally, I will establish sorafenib-resistant HCC xenografts in
order to identify potential synergy between our APSS therapy and sorafenib. The significance of the proposed
research is that it will: (i) improve our understanding of PKM alternative splicing in tumorigenesis; (ii) help to
identify synergistic therapies that reinforce the effects of our APSS therapy; and (iii) provide further justification
for the eventual testing of our APSS therapy in clinical trials for advanced HCC."
10827411,"Neurodevelopmental disorders, including psychiatric symptoms and learning disabilities, and substance use,
remain public health concerns as they can lead to suboptimal educational and occupational outcomes in
adolescence and adulthood. Human brain development is a complex process that begins in the weeks following
conception and undergoes rapid development through the first two years of postnatal life. Advancing
understanding of early neurodevelopmental processes, and the conditions which foster healthy versus
maladaptive development, represents a critical means of addressing these challenges. The rapidly growing field
of fetal, infant, and toddler neuroimaging demonstrates potential to contribute to this area, with an increase from
160 to 530 publications per year during the 1990's to 2021. Yet, a myriad of challenges hinder progress of the
field including methodological issues related to data acquisition and processing; rapid changes in available
technology and tools with limited resources for dissemination to users; and underrepresentation of minoritized
individuals among research participants and researchers. We considered the growing pains of the community
and responded to the need for a bridge organization that brings together those with expertise in developmental
neuroscience, clinical-science, and computational and biomedical engineering to facilitate advances in data
quality and image processing tools for the young brain. The Fetal, Infant, and Toddler Neuroimaging Group
(FIT'NG), non-profit academic society established in 2018, aims to bring together interdisciplinary researchers
with a focus on neurodevelopment during the first years of life. An annual meeting focused solely on this field is
essential to keep up with technological advances, establish and share best practices to address methodological
challenges, and increase diversity at every level. We propose a multi-year conference application to support the
following specific aims: to (1) stimulate new research and collaboration between FIT'NG scientists across
disciplines; (2) increase the opportunity for scientists from racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse
backgrounds, with particular attention to underrepresented minority scientists, to highlight their work, and engage
effectively in this field of research; and (3) promote and support the development of the next generation of FIT'NG
researchers by providing financial and career support for young investigators to attend the meeting. The timing
of the meetings aligns with the Healthy Brain and Child Development (HBCD) initiative of eight NIH institutes, a
groundbreaking study involving neuroimaging with thousands of newborns across the United States that will be
prospectively followed from birth through childhood. The FIT'NG meeting will provide a forum for U.S.
investigators both within and outside of the HBCD network to exchange information and collaborate, and engage
with the international community of scientists conducting fetal, infant and toddler neuroimaging research."

Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) can increase the risk for obesity both during childhood and later in
adulthood. Emerging evidence suggests a parent's history of ACEs can increase their child's obesity risk,
regardless of whether the child experiences their own ACEs. The association between a parent's ACEs and
their child's obesity is believed to be moderated by via enduring stress-related effects of ACEs on parent's
biology and behavior and family functioning. Research on ACEs-obesity associations rarely focuses on
neighborhood environment, yet neighborhood characteristics are relevant to both ACEs and obesity risk.
Neighborhood characteristics such as greenspace and food access can impact engagement in obesity related
behaviors. Neighborhood factors such as neighborhood poverty and crime can be a source of adversity. Our
previous research documented that adults with a history of ACEs live in less health-promoting neighborhoods
with more obesogenic qualities (e.g., worse supermarket access, less greenspace). However neighborhood's
impact on associations between a parent's ACEs and their child's obesity has not been widely investigated.
Illuminating the role of neighborhood requires advanced spatial analytic methods, because neighborhoods
are complex environments comprised of numerous synergistic characteristics that co-occur within a broader
context of racial and economic segregation. To begin to illuminate neighborhood influences on ACEs-obesity
associations, we validated spatial analytic methods for creating a Neighborhood ACEs Index (NAI). A NAI is
a weighted composite that answers the question “what is the neighborhood environment of individuals who
have experienced ACEs?” It serves as a single-item individual-level proxy for collective neighborhood
environment associated with ACEs. Individuals who live in neighborhoods that have more characteristics
associated with ACEs have a higher NAI score. Using geocoding and spatial methods, a NAI connects
individual-level ACEs data with rich spatial data that includes numerous neighborhood characteristics such as
crime, poverty, and healthcare access. A NAI can be used as an independent variable in analyses to examine
how neighborhood characteristics associated with ACEs influence the relationship of ACEs and obesity. In
addition, a NAI identifies population-specific neighborhood-level targets for interventions and polices.
Neighborhoods whose residents have the highest NAI score can be prioritized for trauma-informed obesity
reduction efforts. Building upon our prior work, this study will create a NAI based upon parent ACEs and
test how that NAI influences associations between a parent's history of ACEs and their child's obesity.
We will harness robust existing data from the H2O study (N=1320) that captured parent ACEs and child
obesity, rich spatial data that captured neighborhood environment, and robust spatial methods. Collectively,
this study is a foundational step towards our long-term goal: informing development of place-based
interventions and policies to reduce obesity for millions of Americans affected by ACEs."

Inhalation of airborne particles, especially fine and ultrafine particulate matter (PM) can lead to pulmonary
inflammation, which if not resolved, can cause lung injury and subsequent development of several chronic
diseases. Pulmonary cells release signaling molecules to orchestrate inflammatory responses via cell-cell
communication. One of the essential cell-cell communication mechanisms is via extracellular vesicles (EVs)
and their enclosed cargoes (e.g. microRNAs). Compared to the extracellular signaling molecules, EVs carry
the advantages of protecting the messengers better with their membrane structures and enhancing their effective
concentrations within the vesicular compartment. Thus, identifying the key EV populations responsible for
inflammation regulation and even resolution could greatly help development of therapeutics to alleviate the
damage from the airborne particle-induced inflammation. However, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact types of
EVs and their cargos responsible for inflammation resolution. We hypothesize that by tracing the EVs derived
from pulmonary cells with the special focus on exosomes (Exos) at various time points during inflammation
development, we can identify the specific EV sub-groups responsible for inflammation resolution. Hence, we
proposed to identify Exos and their miRNA cargos in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lung tissue
in acute and sub-chronic models of pulmonary inflammation (Aim1) and employ NanOstirBar-EnabLed
Single EV Analysis (NOBEL-SEA) to analyze cell specific Exos and enclosed miRNAs (Aim 2). NOBEL-
SEA is a highly innovative advanced analytical technique developed in Dr. Zhong’s group. This technique
enables detection of single EVs and their enclosed miRNA cargos with low sample consumption, high sensitivity
and specificity, and short turn-around time. We will examine the kinetic secretion profiles of Exos in two
inflammation models induced by two nanoparticles that have shown in our previous work to cause either
resolving or persistent inflammation. We will first profile miRNAs from isolated exosomes in BAL fluid and lung
tissue and then apply NOBEL-SEA for analyses of cell-specific Exos and miRNAs. Utilizing two inflammation
models will allow us to study differences in Exos and miRNAs secretion during inflammation initiation and
resolution. Monitoring the dynamic of Exo secretion from different cells and revealing their enclosed miRNAs will
help achieve better understanding on how this EV subtype mediates communication between pulmonary cells
and contributes to the transformation from pro- to anti-inflammatory states. It will pave the way for our long-term
goals in exploring the functions of EVs for alleviation of inflammatory lung diseases induced by exposure to
ultrafine airborne particles."

 There is a critical gap in understanding hospital- and structural-level causes leading to maternal
mortality and severe maternal morbidity (SMM), particularly with regard to preventable deaths.
Understanding and addressing these root causes of mortality and SMM is particularly urgent for Black,
Indigenous and other birthing people of color. Black pregnant and postpartum people are 3-4 times more likely
to die from pregnancy-related causes and have a two-fold higher risk of SMM compared to their White
counterparts. Race is not a biological construct, but a social one with real health consequences. Both
structual racism (which creates differential distribution of opportunities for health by race), and experiences of
interpersonal racism (explicit and implicit bias) play a role in health consequences for Black, Indigenous, and
other birthing people.
 Our central hypothesis is that social determinants of health and hospital factors significantly impact
maternal and pregnancy outcomes, and are more prognostic for BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color)

(Universities of Missouri and Utah) with geocoding, social security death files, obituary files, and PCORnet to
elucidate the impact of structural and social determinants of health (SSDoH), on rates of maternal mortality and
SMM, and to assess the extent to which these factors explain or predict inequity in these outcomes among
Black birthing people. We hypothesize that downstream consequences of structural racism will have an
significant association with mortality and SMM, and will help explain inequity in mortality and SMM rates
between Black and White birthing people. Aim 2 will interrogate de-identified healthcare records from the
Cerner Corporation's multi-institutional Real-World DataTM system to identify hospital-level factors associated
with maternal mortality and SMM, and to assess the extent to which these factors explain or predict inequity in
these outcomes among Black birthing people. We hypothesize that hospital-level factors such as medical
services segregation, maternal levels of care, urban/rural status, and patient demographics and comorbidities
have significant impact.
 The proposed research is innovative, as it will (a) use data to develop and validate a prognostic scoring
tool for maternal mortality/SMM; (b) assess hospital-level factors that may contribute to maternal mortality,
using data from 128 separate health systems in Cerner's database; (c) integrate geocoding and linked death
data to enable better estimates of structural and social determinants of health (SSDoH) factors that contribute
to maternal mortality/SMM; and (d) facilitate a rapid “scale-up” to a national level, given the multi-site nature of
the Greater Plains Collaborative (GPC)/PCORnet data system."

This is the first renewal application for the Tulane StARR Program which successfully recruited a diverse cadre
of 6 StARR Scholars who are actively engaged in mentored research training in heart, lung, and blood (HLB)
diseases in the last 2.5 years. The long-term goal is to increase the number and diversity of highly trained,
independent, interdisciplinary board-certified physician scientists engaging in HLB research. Key components of
our successful mentored research and career development StARR program include: 1) Boot Camps and
didactics tailored to specific Scholar needs; 2) individualized career development training; 3) StARR Physician
Scientists seminar series; 4) Work-in-Progress sessions; 5) required grant writing, project management, and
mentoring workshops; 6) mentored interdisciplinary research; 7) responsible conduct in research training; 8)
institutional resources; and 9) a planned transition for StARR Scholars to fellowship training, K38, K12, or K-like
programs,. The innovative approach involves tailoring the program to Scholars needs using self-efficacy surveys
and individual development plans (IDP) and using a network mentoring model for each Scholar Oversight
Committee (SOC) which includes expertise in both basic and clinical science and clinical care, as well as
participation by the Residency Program Director to ensure appropriate integration of clinical and research
rotations. Scholars are immediately exposed to research, are guided to establish a scholarly track record early,
and participate in national scientific meetings. New components of Tulane StARR 2 include expanding capacity
by increasing faculty Preceptors and Tulane Research Centers in expanded fields of HLB; building Scholar
competence in team science and equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) in research; and advancing understanding
of the interplay between HLB with social determinants of health (SDOH).The Scholars will learn cutting-edge
research methods and skills from Bench (cellular, molecular, and genetics), to Bedside (clinical research and
clinical trials) to Population (epidemiology, prevention, and implementation research) and conduct mentored
research projects in established laboratories/research groups led by 52 outstanding NIH-funded Preceptors in a
mentored, interdisciplinary environment that addresses NHLBI priorities from a lifespan perspective. With strong
institutional support and approval of the training by the American Board of Internal Medicine and American Board
of Pediatrics, we propose to train 8 (6 new, 2 carryover from Tulane StARR 1) resident StARR Scholars (4
medicine residents and 4 pediatric residents; 50% women and 25% underrepresented groups (URG)) for 18
months (in 6-month Research Blocks in PGY 2, PGY3, and PGY4 with 80% effort dedicated to research) over
the 4-year residency program while maintaining Continuity Clinics. Ongoing and comprehensive evaluation will
assess and guide improvements to the StARR Program’s effectiveness in 1) bridging research training and
research independence; 2) ensuring board eligibility for medicine and pediatrics residents; and 3) increasing the
number and diversity of physician scientists translating science to improve human health across the lifespan."

Internalizing problems, most prominently anxiety and depressive disorders affect > 400 million people globally.
Rooted in early development starting in utero, there is a steep rise in these disorders in the transition to
adolescence. Identifying those at risk as early in life as possible is critical in order to ensure optimal
development and prevention. There has been growing interest in studying the role of nutritional factors in
modifying effects of chemical environmental exposures, as nutrition is amenable to intervention. Our group was
recently funded to examine the role of prenatal exposure to metals and their mixtures on early life
neurobehavioral domains linked to a greater risk of developing anxiety and depressive disorders later in
childhood (R01 ES033436, RJ Wright PI). In addition, we demonstrated that several nutrients, particularly
those with antioxidant potential (e.g., vitamin A) can mitigate the impacts of metals on fetal growth, providing
proof of concept for this proposal. The joint associations between maternal prenatal nutrition and in utero metal
exposures in influencing offspring’s internalizing disorders remain poorly understood, particularly beginning in
the prenatal period. To overcome existing knowledge gaps, we will examine the joint associations of prenatal
exposure to maternal nutrition and heavy metals on young children’s internalizing problems and related
prefrontal cortex (PFC) functions in the PRogramming of Intergenerational Stress Mechanisms (PRISM)
cohort. PRISM is a racially and ethnically diverse urban sample with extant data on prenatal urinary metal
exposure and children’s neurobehavioral outcomes measured at ages 6 months and 3-5 years. We will
leverage available data on maternal prenatal nutrition assessed two ways - (i) using a food frequency
questionnaire (FFQ) and (ii) measurement of additional micronutrient biomarkers in maternal blood and urine
obtained in pregnancy. This will enable us to determine how maternal nutrition affects internalizing behaviors in
early childhood as well as to examine the modifying effects of optimal or inadequate intake of key
micronutrients on associations between metals and neurobehavioral outcomes. We hypothesize that increased
intake or higher measured levels of antioxidant micronutrients (e.g., retinol, carotenoids, tocohperhols) will
mitigate associations between prenatal metal exposures and internalizing problems whereas lower intake or
levels of iodine will interact with metals to enhance risk of neurobehavioral problems. Novel advanced
statistical modeling will consider interactions between metal and micronutrient mixtures allowing examination of
non-linear relationships between mixtures and internalizing problems. Applying mixture analysis and agonistic
selection of nutrients has the potential to characterize modifiers that have not been identified in studies focused
on a single nutrient or a specific diet pattern. Sex-specific effects will also be explored. Understanding the
independent and modifying effects of key micronutrients in the relationship between prenatal metal exposures
and early indicators of psychiatric risk is arguably critical to informing future interventions."
10827442,"Project Summary/Abstract
Epidemiologic evidence has established obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease
(AD). However, the mechanisms of this increase in AD risk remain unclear. Three potentially AD-relevant clinical
features of OSA include severity of hypoxemia, global sleep fragmentation, and local deficits in memory-relevant
sleep oscillations, i.e. slow waves and sleep spindles. These clinical features of OSA have been independently
linked to amyloid and tau burden and accumulation, medial temporal lobe (MTL) degeneration, and MTL-
dependent memory impairment—all hallmark biomarkers of AD. However, it remains unclear how each of these
features relate to AD pathophysiology or MTL-dependent memory decline in patients with OSA. The overarching
research objective of this proposal is to address these unknowns. The proposed specific aims are to determine
whether distinct global and local OSA features are associated with 1) cortical amyloid burden, 2) MTL tau burden,
and 3) degeneration of specific MTL brain circuits supporting multiple forms of memory known to depend on
sleep and be vulnerable to AD pathophysiology. The proposed aims will be supported by leveraging existing
resources, and collecting high density electroencephalography (hdEEG, 256 channels) sleep recordings in
cognitively normal older adults (60-85 years) undergoing positron emission tomography (PET) to assess amyloid
and tau burden, as well as ultrahigh resolution magnetic resonance imaging (uhr-MRI) of MTL structure. The
proposed study will therefore capitalize on an opportunity to examine how OSA relates to AD pathological
burden, MTL structure and function, and memory in an unprecedented level of detail and breadth. This is
congruent with both my short and long-term career goals. Specifically, I plan to generate research proposals
seeking funding to uncover the impact of distinct forms of sleep disturbance on circuit and molecular mechanisms
of AD pathogenesis in humans. This will support my efforts to establish a clinical research program evaluating i)
the contribution of sleep disturbance to the onset and progression of various forms of neurodegenerative disease
across clinical stages, ii) the utility of sleep-based biomarkers to predict dementia onset and aid differential
diagnosis between dementias, and iii) the utility of targeted sleep-based interventions to arrest cognitive decline
associated with AD and related dementias. This research proposal and my long-term career goals are supported
by my training plan overseen by my mentoring team which includes experts in hdEEG, uhr-MRI, MTL-dependent
memory circuit function, PET methods in the context of aging and AD—including amyloid and tau PET, clinical
aspects of sleep disorders, geriatric psychiatry, and neurodegenerative disease, and clinical trial design and
implementation in the context of sleep disorders and AD. The proposed training plan includes structured
mentoring on each of these topics and participation in a clinical research certificate program, as well as a course
focused on clinical trials in AD. By establishing this research program, I hope to develop sleep-based approaches
to reduce risk, delay onset, and slow progression of dementia and age-related cognitive decline."

 A central question in the study of cell cycle regulation is, how the cell cycle transitions are controlled to
allow the transition to the next cell cycle stage at a right time? Such control mechanisms are critical for
maintaining genome integrity because premature transition from one stage to the next stage of the cell cycle
can lead to aneuploidy and, hence, cell death. Four major cell cycle transition points, the G1/S transition, the
G2/M transition, the metaphase/anaphase transition, and the mitosis/cytokinesis transition, are under stringent
control, but how they are regulated at the molecular level in T. brucei, a protozoan parasite and the causative
agent of human sleeping sickness, remains poorly understood. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are key
regulators of the cell cycle transitions in eukaryotes, and T. brucei employs the CDK-related kinase CRK1 to
control the G1/S transition, CRK2 to promote S-phase progression, and CRK3 to govern the G2/M transition.
The roles of CRK1 in controlling the nuclear events in promoting the G1/S transition and the role of CRK2 in
regulating S-phase progression have been recently revealed by us. However, the molecular mechanisms
underlying the G2/M transition and the metaphase/anaphase transition are still elusive. Further, it is generally
accepted that T. brucei lacks several cell cycle checkpoints, including the spindle assembly checkpoint, and it
is unclear how T. brucei recognizes the genomic errors occurred during the cell cycle and prevents erroneous
genome duplication and premature genome segregation. Our recent discovery of a novel DNA damage-
induced metaphase checkpoint suggests a kinetochore-based checkpoint machinery in T. brucei, but the
underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. The current proposal aims to understand the control of the
G2/M transition by CRK3-mediated regulation of the chromosomal passenger complex, the control of
metaphase/anaphase transition by CRK3-mediated regulation of kinetochore proteins, and the mechanism of
the metaphase checkpoint mediated by KKIP5 and its associated proteins. The outcomes from these
investigations not only will have important biological significance, but also could provide novel targets for anti-
trypanosomiasis chemotherapy."
10808919,"Clostridium difficile is the leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in the hospital and long
term health care settings. In addition to the patient toll, the treatment-associated costs of C.
difficile infections to the United States healthcare system have been estimated at $5 billion.
Although the rate of C. difficile infection in the United States is rising, surprisingly little is known
about the mechanisms of C. difficile pathogenesis. C. difficile is believed to be acquired by the
host in the form of a dormant spore. To cause disease, the spore must respond in the
gastrointestinal tract to signals that trigger germination, thereby allowing growth as a vegetative
bacterium, toxin production and subsequent spore formation before excretion into the
environment. Taurocholic acid, a bile acid normally found in the GI tract, and glycine are co-
germinants for C. difficile spores. Another bile acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, inhibits taurocholic
acid-mediated germination and is toxic for C. difficile vegetative growth. In prior work, the
molecular target of bile acids on the C. difficile spore was identified - identifying the first C.
difficile spore germinant receptor. This led to the finding that C. difficile spore germination
proceeds through a novel, ‘outside – in’ germination pathway. More recently, the target of the
amino acid co-germinants on the C. difficile spore was identified. In this proposal, the
investigator proposes to: (1) characterize how the C. difficile ‘germinosome’ proteins interact; (2)
define the mechanism of localization of these proteins in the C. difficile spore; (3) globally
identify YabG protease targets; and (4) characterize the impact of these targets on C. difficile
pathogenesis. Successful completion of the experiments outlined herein will extend the
understanding of the mechanisms of C. difficile germination, open new avenues in the study of
C. difficile spore formation and spore germination."
10843205,"There is increasing recognition of the importance of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) for assessment of health-
related quality of life in both research and clinical settings. PROs are especially important for inherently subjective
but crucial clinical phenomena such as pain, mood, and fatigue. Despite much research in PROs, concerns
about reliability and validity persist, especially when used at the individual level, particularly among patients who
may struggle to understand PRO questions, such as those with low health literacy or undetected cognitive
impairment. Over the past decade, we have developed and tested a tool with the potential to enhance PROs at
the individual level – embodied conversational agents (ECA), which are computer characters that simulate face-
to-face conversation using voice, hand gestures, gaze cues and other nonverbal behavior. We have successfully
used them in behavioral interventions for populations with limited health literacy, elderly patients, and patients
with cancer. Face-to-face encounters, in conjunction with written instructions supported by pictures, remains one
of the best methods for communicating information in general, but is particularly effective for individuals with
limited health literacy. We have also demonstrated that ECAs can be used as valid alternatives to standard
paper-based surveys for substance use screening, and that the display of empathy for patients and other
relational behavior by ECAs leads to increased engagement by patients over time. We will adapt our prior work
on ECAs to produce ECA-PRO, a framework for administering PROs over time using an ECA on patients’
smartphones in English and Spanish. The ECA-PRO system will include novel user interfaces to optimally
communicate the results to patients and clinicians using clear visualizations. To demonstrate the generalizability
of ECA-PRO, we will focus on two clinical scenarios: 1) longitudinal monitoring of symptoms and quality of life in
patients undergoing cancer treatment, and 2) monitoring of medication adherence in patients taking long-term
oral anti-cancer drugs. We hypothesize that the ECA-PRO system, designed for individual-patient-level
interactions and data collection, will improve the reliability, validity, and overall clinical relevance of PROs
collected during cancer treatment. We will develop and evaluate a PRO system that engages patients with
interactive communication and empathy, while delivering standard PROs in a way that minimizes missing data
and enables user-friendly visual sharing of results. The ECA-PRO system will create a strong foundation for
PRO-based clinical decision-making. If successful, these tools can be rapidly and broadly disseminated."
10809603,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
There is a critical need to identify novel mechanisms of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) that will provide targets
for new interventions. Chronic inflammation is one plausible mechanism.
Using untargeted high-throughput aptamer proteomics, our recently published study has shed new light on
specific, key inflammatory drivers of DKD. This was a large prospective three-cohort study that identified a
novel and extremely robust circulating signature (KRIS) associated with risk of ESRD in diabetes.
Our pilot study points to the data-driven connection between circulating KRIS and urinary profiles of the
Complement pathway. Our hypothesis is that the Complement involvement in the kidney is a downstream
effect of the systemic inflammatory processes mediating an increased DKD risk.
The overarching goal of this proposal is to provide a high-resolution view of the involvement of the
Complement proteome in progressive diabetic kidney disease.
Aim 1 will comprehensively evaluate the etiological role of the urinary Complement proteome in progressive
DKD leading to ESRD. This evaluation will leverage a prospective two-cohort population of Joslin Kidney Study
(JKS) participants with an overt DKD at baseline followed for 10 years (primary outcome – incident ESRD).
Measurements will utilize an aptamer proteomic technology (SOMAscan).
Aim 2 will extend generalizability of the urinary Complement proteome to earlier DKD stages. The proposed
study will be conducted in participants of the Preventing Early Renal Loss (PERL) clinical trial with
predominantly normal renal function at baseline followed for 3 years (primary outcome - renal slope).
Aim 3 proposes to gain direct insight into the intra-renal Complement proteome by targeted and untargeted
protein studies in diabetic kidney tissue (Susztaklab Biobank).
This project focuses on a significant public health problem, leverages the progressiveness of the disease,
employs an innovative proteomic technology and stems from strong preliminary data. Advances in this project
will pinpoint missing key components of DKD etiology, thereby accelerating drug development strategies for
patients with diabetes."

Myelination is critical for normal conduction of action potentials and synchronized transmission of neural
impulses. Recent studies have demonstrated that CNS myelin development, maturation and maintenance are
regulated by neuronal activity and experience. In contrast, very little is known about how experience and
activity regulate myelin development in the PNS, nor how experience-dependent neural activity affects re-
myelination after peripheral nerve or glial cell injury in vivo. This is in part due to the difficulty in precisely
altering activity of PNS nerves, since they are typically a mixture of both sensory and motor fibers, or of
sensory axons mediating different types of modalities. We hypothesize that sensory activity regulates
peripheral nerve myelination, myelin maintenance and remyelination, and propose to address this fundamental
gap in knowledge using the auditory system as a model. Type I auditory nerve (AN) fibers in the mouse
cochlea offer an ideal platform to dissect the role of activity on peripheral myelination because: (a) maturation
of AN myelin coincides with auditory function maturation during the first postnatal month, suggesting that
activity may affect Schwann cells; (b) re-myelination of AN fibers occurs following Schwann cell ablation; (c)
AN myelin dysfunction is associated with hearing deficits, demonstrating a critical role for myelination in
cochlear function, particularly in the transmission of key temporal features of sound that are important for
understanding speech; (d) we can manipulate the activity of primary auditory neurons by ablating hair cells, by
exposing animals to defined auditory experiences, or using genetic tools; (e) we can efficiently isolate and
examine the entire peripheral AN at the structural, cellular and molecular levels; and (f) we can assess the
impact of myelin defects on cochlear and auditory nerve function in the intact mouse can be assessed at high-
resolution with standard electrophysiological techniques. Furthermore, AN axons are myelinated by both
Schwann cells (in the distal part) and oligodendrocytes (in the proximal part), permitting a direct comparison of
the effects of activity on both types of myelinating cells within the same nerve. We will use mouse models to
address this gap in knowledge in three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will use mutants that are defective in hair
cell mechanotransduction and synaptic function to determine the role of AN activity in myelination during the
neonatal and juvenile time periods. In Aim 2, we will test the roles of auditory experience and NRG1/ErbBR
signaling in AN myelination during the neonatal and juvenile periods. Finally, in Aim 3, we will test whether
sound-driven neuronal activity modulates AN re-myelination in the mature cochlea. Successful completion of
the proposed aims will provide valuable insight into the role of neural activity in PNS myelination and a more
precise understanding of the impact of myelin dysfunction on hearing."
10809608,"Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is a highly fatal cancer with 5-year survival under 20%. Alarmingly,
the incidence of cancer of the esophagus has increased significantly over the past 30 years. EAC arises from a
known precursor lesion, termed Barrett's esophagus (BE), that can be easily recognized at endoscopy. However,
current clinical strategies of screening and surveillance are inadequate and EAC diagnosis often occurs at
advanced and unresectable stages of the disease. Veterans are increased risk for BE and EAC compared to the
general population due to increased risk factors (including age >50 and male gender). There is an urgent clinical
need to improve strategies for the detection, prognostication, and treatment of BE and EAC. This translational
research proposal aims to elucidate the molecular carcinogenesis of EAC, with the ultimate goal of reducing the
burden associated with this deadly cancer.
 We used integrative computational and genetic analyses to identify common mechanisms that underlie
EAC tumor progression. We identified that the TGFβ pathway is highly active in EAC compared to non-malignant
BE. The TGFβ/Smad pathway has tumor suppressive properties in epithelial cells, including inhibition of cell
proliferation and induction of apoptosis, and the functional TGFβ pathway elements are frequently lost through
mutation in gastrointestinal malignancies. However, in established cancers TGFβ signaling can promote invasion
and metastasis, suggesting opposing roles for TGFβ signaling that depend on disease stage. In contrast, our
preliminary findings show that the TGFβ pathway fails to inhibit the growth of pre-malignant dysplastic BE cells
in addition to EAC cells; on the contrary TGFβ induces growth of EAC cells even in the presence of functional
TGFβ pathway components. Further, the pro-tumorigenic TGFβ pathway effects are evident in EAC that are
either wild-type or mutant for Smad4, a canonical mediator of TGFβ signaling. Together, our preliminary studies
indemnify an alternative model for the oncogenic TGFβ with early hyperactivation of an unconventional, Smad4
independent, Smad2/3 dependent pathway.
 Our findings have important translational implications. In Aim 1, we will investigate the molecular
determinants of the oncogenic TGFβ signaling in EAC carcinogensis. In Aim 2, we will assess impact of
disrupting oncogenic TGFβ signaling in highly relevant pre-clinical models of EAC. Of particular importance,
LY2157299 (galunisertib), an orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of the TGFβ Receptor – Type 1, is
currently being tested in Phase II trials in other malignancies and represents a new therapeutic strategy that can
be rapidly evaluated for this lethal cancer.
 This study is highly innovative and will improve our ability to both prevent and treat cancer of the
esophagus. The scientific proposal and career development activities described here will serve an essential role
in my development as a clinical gastroenterologist at the VA and as a scientist with research program aimed at
improving early detection and treatment of gastrointestinal cancer. Through this CDA-2 award, I will receive
additional training and experience related to cancer biology, systems biology, and pre-clinical models of human
cancer that will be essential to reach my goal. Also, in this rich mentored environment, I will develop skills
required to perform independent research."
10809609,"Despite the enrichment of VA suicide prevention services and implementation of the national
suicide hotline, Veteran suicide completions occur 20 times per day and suicide attempts
numbered over 15,000 in 2012. These data underscore the urgency of developing additional
interventions targeting suicidal Veterans. The construction of a Suicide Safety Plan (SSP); a
“best practice,” is mandated throughout the VA system, and a vital component of the VA’s
coordinated effort at suicide prevention and recovery. Safety Planning in Veterans presenting to
an emergency room has been shown to decrease suicide behavior. To our knowledge, there are
currently no recommended guidelines or mechanisms for refinement of the SSP in adult
populations beyond its initial development. “Project Life Force” (PLF), a novel suicide safety
planning group intervention has been designed to fill this critical gap and provide a mechanism
to develop and enhance suicide safety planning over time. PLF, a 10-session, group
psychotherapy intervention, combines Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) skill based and
psychoeducational approaches, to enhance suicide safety planning development and
implementation. Veterans revise their plans over several weeks while learning distress
tolerance, emotion regulation, and friendship building/interpersonal skills to incorporate into their
safety plans and also receive lessons on gun safety and minimizing access to lethal means,
augmenting physical well being and strategies how to share their plan with family/significant
others and their treatment team. Importantly, the group format mitigates loneliness and fosters
increased “belongingness,” both key risk factors for suicide. Additionally, PLF’s weekly format
facilitates VA-mandated monitoring for any Veteran placed on the suicide “high risk” list. PLF
received pilot SPiRE funding from the VA Rehabilitation and Research Development in 2015 to
finalize the development of the intervention’s manual and pilot the intervention in Veterans.
Preliminary data suggests high levels of feasibility, and acceptability. 100% of participants
developed updated safety plans and increased use patterns and a significant decrease in
suicidal ideation.
This project’s aim is to conduct a multi-site (James J Peters VAMC and Philadelphia VA)
randomized clinical trial (RCT) of PLF versus treatment as usual (TAU) that includes individual
telephone review of safety plans in 265 suicidal Veterans with follow up to one year. The
primary outcome variable is suicidal behavior, using a rigorous, multi-method assessments
follow-up. Secondary outcomes include depression, hopelessness and treatment utilization.
Exploratory analyzes will examine whether changes in suicide coping and levels of group
cohesion in PLF mediate treatment response. Methodological rigor includes ongoing adherence
ratings for PLF and assessment training/monitoring by an independent third site (Columbia
University)."

The ultimate goal of this Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) is to develop
the applicant into an independent investigator prepared to lead ethical, large-scale, and rigorously designed
health services research focused on high-risk emerging adults (EAs; aged 18-25). Specifically, the applicant will
focus on improving access to and engagement in evidence-based practices (EBPs) for EAs with opioid and other
substance use (SU) and co-occurring justice system (JS) involvement, via use of paraprofessional coaches. The
proposed career development and research plan builds on the applicant's prior training in clinical and
developmental psychology, EBPs, and SU. Through the proposed training plan, the applicant will: (1) gain direct
experience conducting ethical health services research with vulnerable populations; (2) attain knowledge and
skills for measurement, methodologies, and the interplay of key developmental outcomes in EAs with opioid and
other SU problems; (3) advance expertise in the complex statistical methods required for health services
research, including mixed methods research, and (4) facilitate professional development as an independent
health services researcher focused on EAs with opioid and other SU problems via extensive training in grant
writing, grants management, and development of a health services program of research. Training activities will
include formal training and mentorship from a team of experts in the fields of SU, randomized clinical trials, EA
peer support, bioethics, justice, implementation, and advanced health services statistical methods; intensive
training in conducting ethical research with high-risk populations; coursework and lectures on implementation
science, qualitative research methods, statistics, and protection of human subjects; and participation in scientific
workshops and conferences. The applicant will apply these skills to pilot research aimed at using
paraprofessional coaches to increase engagement and access to EBPs (i.e., contingency management for SU
and vocational/educational coaching) for EAs with SU and JS involvement. In partnership with parole and
probation, EAs with SU will be randomized to work with paraprofessional coaches either with or without lived
experience (i.e., successful SU recovery). Although using peer paraprofessional coaches (those with lived
experience) is becoming more popular and supported at the federal level, the outcome of this work on the
paraprofessional coaches themselves, especially for EAs, is largely unexplored. The proposed study will use
both quantitative and qualitative methods to gain a better understanding of the impacts on both the coaches and
their EA clients using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Given the high rates
and particularly detrimental effects of SU for EAs with JS involvement, the goals of this project have the potential
to address an important and costly public health problem. As SU and poor vocational/educational attainment
greatly increases the likelihood of recidivism, innovative strategies to reduce opioid and other SU for EAs is
critical, along with understanding the effects on the service providers (i.e., paraprofessional coaches)."

Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy associated with KCNQ2 channels has been primarily linked to
loss-of-function KCNQ2 mutations. However, an increasing number of recurrent KCNQ2 gain-of-function
variants (i.e., R201C) have been identified. Patients with the KCNQ2R201C mutation display severe myoclonus
and early profound hypoventilation due to reduced chemoreflex. Currently, mechanisms by which KCNQ2
channels control the drive to breathe are unclear. The retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) is an important respiratory
center; neurons in this region function as respiratory chemoreceptors by regulating breathing in response to
changes in tissue CO2. Chemosensitive RTN neurons are activated by an increase in CO2/H+, whereas a gain-
of-function Kcnq2 mutation might hyperpolarize RTN neurons and make it more difficult to respond to CO2/H+.
Indeed, work from the parent grant showed that expression of the recurrent Kcnq2 mutation Kcnq2R201C in RTN
neurons blunted the ventilatory response to CO2. Excitingly, we also found that Kcnq2 channel activity in RTN
neurons is regulated by a H+-myo-inositol cotransporter (HMIT) which imports myo-inositol to support
production of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), an allosteric activator of Kcnq2 channels. HMIT
expression in the RTN region is restricted only to chemosensitive neurons. Therefore, we hypothesize that
HMIT is required for Kcnq2 channel activity in RTN neurons. In particular, we propose that H+-dependent myo-
inositol transport into RTN neurons by HMIT will increase PIP2 levels and activate Kcnq2 channels to limit
CO2/H+-stimulated activity, as well as to maintain neural modulation by neurotransmitters that signal through
Gq-coupled receptors and PIP2 hydrolysis. Thus, the objective of this application is to determine the extent to
which Kcnq2 channels and HMIT interact to control RTN chemoreception under normal conditions and whether
HMIT can be targeted to improve breathing in mice that express Kcnq2R201C. The three Specific Aims of this
project are: 1) determine the extent to which HMIT influences Kcnq2 channel regulation of chemosensitive
RTN neurons; 2) determine contributions of Kcnq2 channels and HMIT interactions to RTN chemoreceptor
network excitability; and 3) to establish HMIT in RTN neurons as a therapeutic target for Kcnq2 associated
breathing abnormalities. The rationale for this research is that by understanding how HMIT regulates Kcnq2
channel activity in RTN neurons, we can lay a foundation for developing treatments for respiratory problems
associated with Kcnq2 mutations."

HMIT can be targeted to improve breathing in mice that express Kcnq2R201C. The three Specific Aims of this
project are: 1) determine the extent to which HMIT influences Kcnq2 channel regulation of chemosensitive
RTN neurons; 2) determine contributions of Kcnq2 channels and HMIT interactions to RTN chemoreceptor
network excitability; and 3) to establish HMIT in RTN neurons as a therapeutic target for Kcnq2 associated
breathing abnormalities. The rationale for this research is that by understanding how HMIT regulates Kcnq2
channel activity in RTN neurons, we can lay a foundation for developing treatments for respiratory problems
associated with Kcnq2 mutations."
10807674,"Activation of the innate immune system in response to sepsis, organ damage, or mechanical injury initiates
critical catabolic processes in muscle and fat. Such catabolism provides metabolic substrates including
amino acids, fatty acids, and minerals that fuel metabolically expensive but essential systemic actions
needed to mitigate sepsis and allow tissue repair. These actions include supporting cellular energy needs,
changes in immunity, the production of acute phase proteins, expansions of inflammatory cell populations,
as well as the repair/regeneration of damaged tissues. Although enteral food intake can supplement the
metabolic substrates needed to combat sepsis, the breakdown of preexisting energy and substrate stores in
the body are the main source for these raw materials, particularly when faced with impaired intestinal
function, anorexia, or ileus.
Significant gaps in understanding the molecular mechanisms that link the response to sepsis with the
associated catabolic response, and recovery remain. This lack of understanding has prevented the
discovery of pharmacologic interventions to potentially improve outcomes from the catabolism-driven
response to sepsis, particularly changes that occur in muscle resulting in decreased mass and weakness.
Yes-associated protein (Yap1) and the transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) are highly
related transcriptional factors regulated by the HIPPO kinase cascade (referred herein as Yap1/TAZ).
Yap1/TAZ is the major regulator of metabolism in most tissues and organs. To date, crosstalk in sepsis
between Yap1/TAZ and the innate immune system remain undefined. Using animal models of organ injury
and sepsis, we have identified that Yap1/TAZ induces CD14, a proximal activator of innate immunity. CD14
directly induces muscle wasting in vivo. Furthermore, blocking CD14 prevents myotube wasting in vitro.
Based upon these results and the current literature, we hypothesize that in response to sepsis,
Yap1/TAZ directly activate CD14 expression. This critical step links a tissue and organ homeostatic
signal in the liver to systemic activation of the innate immune system and catabolic response in
sepsis. Furthermore, these data support that the Yap1/Taz/Cd14 signaling axis is a targetable point to
potentially improve outcomes in sepsis.
Proposed studies will delineate the in vivo significance of hepatic Yap1/TAZ and CD14 in systemic
recovery from sepsis and its effects on the catabolic state. Both murine knockout and over-
expression models will be examined. This proposal will determine the response to sepsis with a focus on
systemic metabolism, liver, and muscle."
10807427,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common life-threatening condition in which progressive enlargement of
the infrarenal aorta can lead to rupture and death. AAA is responsible for approximately 41,000 deaths world-
wide annually, but there are no medical therapies that prevent AAA development, rupture, or aneurysm-related
death. The major epidemiological risk factors for AAA include, male sex, advanced age, genetic predilection and
a history of tobacco use. As such, it is not surprising that an estimated 350,000 Veterans within the VHA suffer
from AAA. The most significant modifiable risk factor associated with AAA is tobacco use, but the molecular
links behind this relationship remain unclear, and there is currently minimal information about the effects of e-
cigarettes on AAA. Our lab has recently shown that nicotine vaping enhances vascular oxidative stress and
inflammatory gene expression, and leads to accelerated murine model AAA. Combined experimental and in
silico analyses suggest that nicotine induces alterations in the vascular epigenetic landscape, priming cells for
inflammatory gene expression and augmenting AAA development. Preliminary single-cell RNA sequencing
experiments demonstrate that inhaled nicotine results in pro-inflammatory transcriptomic alterations in genes
from multiple cell sub-populations. In our first Aim, we will delineate the cell type-specific effects of inhaled
nicotine on chromatin remodeling and on gene expression at single cell resolution in murine model AAA using
combined sc-RNAseq, sc-ATAC-seq, and sc-ChIP-seq analyses of aortic tissue throughout the time course of
AAA development. Pathway analysis will identify programs involved in AAA development, particularly seeking
out initiation and propagation events. Next, we will evaluate the effects of nicotine on epigenetic characteristics
and phenotypic function of AAA-relevant cells in vitro. We will perform pharmacological and genetic
manipulations in cell culture, prioritizing identified signals that appear to have beneficial effects upon vascular
inflammation and cellular integrity. Finally, we will examine the therapeutic impact of inhibiting nicotine-induced
epigenetic changes in our established mouse models of AAA. We will examine aneurysm development and
growth, as well as the effects of such therapies on gene expression in aortic cell subtypes, and the aortic
epigenetic environment. This work will provide novel insights into how nicotine alters the epigenetic landscape
of vascular cells, and predisposes towards AAA development, providing a basis for future research and
suggesting new translational therapeutic targeting strategies. Moreover, given the role of inflammation in many
tobacco-related diseases, these studies could have implications for addressing the broader health effects of
chronic smoking, e-cigarette use and vaping. Further, this work may provide a blueprint for studying the health
effects of exposure to other environmental toxins."
10807655,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with a growing
humanitarian and economic burden. Advanced age is the greatest risk factor for AD so the long-
term goal of this research is to better understand how advancing age contributes to AD
occurrence and progression. Aging and AD pathology are characterized by a decline in the
cell’s ability to eliminate damaged and pathological proteins through endosome trafficking (NOT-
21-034) which contributes to the accumulation of protein like tau within neurons and other cells
of the brain. We have identified a key protein involved in the formation of endosomes, the
vehicle for endosome trafficking, that is decreased in neurons across the lifespan and further
decreased in neurons from donors with AD. We have shown that we can restore expression of
this protein in patient-derived human neurons using adeno-associated virus (AAV) and that this
decreases intracellular tau. Based on these findings, the Specific Aims of this proposal are to: 1)
determine how increasing endosome formation decreases tau in neurons and 2) define how
increasing endosome formation influences cognition and AD pathology in transgenic and aged
wild type mice. If successful, these studies will establish decreased endosome formation as a
cause of tau pathology in AD and support the development of therapeutic strategies to enhance
endosome formation for the treatment of AD and other proteinopathies (i.e., frontotemporal
dementia, Parkinson’s disease and others)."
10810113,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The purpose of this resubmitted Dissertation Research Award (R36) is to support the completion
of a dissertation research project that will lay the foundation for a successful career as an
independent investigator who conducts place-based, policy-relevant research examining and
addressing the structural determinants of substance use among vulnerable, criminal-legally
involved populations. People convicted of sexual offenses and required to register as sex
offenders (PRR) under sex offender registration and notification (SORN) policies are a particularly
stigmatized subpopulation of people involved in the criminal legal system, and are an important
but understudied subgroup who may be disproportionately impacted by substance use and
treatment need. Evidence consistently demonstrates that SORN policies do not deter sexual
offending or serve a public safety function but do have wide-ranging and significantly destabilizing
collateral consequences for PRR, who face material and social restrictions as direct and indirect
results of SORN policies. These include: housing instability, unemployment, isolation/alienation,
poor mental health, abandonment by social networks, exclusions from community spaces, and
overt discrimination, harassment and vigilantism. Simultaneously, SORN policies limit PRR
access to and eligibility for substance use treatment and harm reduction services. While no
existing literature has examined harms associated with substance use in the context of collateral
consequences for PRRs, it is likely that, given the known relationships among economic, social,
and structural vulnerabilities and substance use, SORN policies increase PRRs’ risk of substance
related harms, and contribute to elevated levels of substance use disorder among PRRs. The
goal of this proposed research is to address this important gap in knowledge and provide evidence
for future interventions that will improve both public health and public safety. This goal will be
achieved by qualitatively exploring the relationship between SORN policies and patterns of
substance use and treatment access through 1) 30 semi-structured stakeholder interviews with
attorneys, probation officers, substance use and sex offender treatment providers, and reentry
case managers to elucidate the substance use and policy landscape for PRR and 2) 50 semi-
structured interviews with PRR to reveal how the policy environment impacts access to substance
use treatment and other social services, and influences the lived experiences of people subject
to SORN. This dissertation project will support growth towards research independence, and will
lay the groundwork for a future program of policy-relevant research examining and addressing
how SORN policies operate as structural determinants of behavioral and social health."
10810116,"Project Summary/Abstract
Inhalation of particulate matter is a known risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease. Tungsten
is an emerging environmental contaminant, particularly in occupational settings such as heavy metal
manufacturing and military, where ambient air concentrations have been reported as high as 3.1 mg/m3 and
exposure is associated with increased risk of pulmonary diseases. However, limited studies have investigated
the systemic consequences of this pulmonary damage. Recent epidemiological data have established that
increased exposure to tungsten leads to increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and stroke. However, no
studies have taken a systematic mechanistic approach to investigate how exposure to tungsten affects the
heart or cardiovascular disease risk factors. The long-term goal in our program is to define the long-term health
consequences of chronic exposure to tungsten and determine the underlying molecular mechanisms of
toxicity. We have strong preliminary data in mice, indicating that a single 4-hour inhalation exposure to
tungsten particulates results in persistent deposition of tungsten in the lungs, acute pulmonary inflammation
characterized by elevated levels of IL-1β, and early signs of fibrosis. Subsequently, four, 4-hour exposures to
tungsten over the course of 2 weeks result in increased expression of IL-1β and other pro-inflammatory and
pro-fibrogenic markers in the heart and early signs of cardiac dysfunction. Our central hypothesis is that
tungsten exposure drives cardiovascular disease development through activation of IL-1β signaling and
enhanced cardiac remodeling leading to fibrosis. In Aim 1, we will use an innovative experimental design to
determine how chronic inhalation exposure to tungsten affects cardiac function and the development of
cardiovascular disease, alone or through further exacerbation of angiotensin II-mediated cardiovascular
disease (two-hit model). We will also define the role of inflammation and cardiac remodeling in disease
pathogenesis, define systemic mediators of disease following this pulmonary insult, and distinguish tungsten-
specific particulate effects through comparison with an active control particle. In Aim 2, we will use an IL-1β
specific monoclonal antibody to block IL-1β signaling to investigate the impact of IL-1β signaling on tungsten-
mediated inflammation and remodeling processes in disease development. This work is innovative and
significant because it utilizes state-of-the art tools to investigate molecular mechanisms driving tungsten-
mediated cardiovascular disease. Discoveries from these studies will impact Research to Practice initiatives to
inform identification of at-risk occupational populations, development of monitoring programs, and identification
of effective countermeasures to block immune fibroblast crosstalk, which could mitigate cardiovascular disease
risk. This proposal directly addresses NIOSH Strategic Plan Research Goal #1 and NORA cross-sectors
Cardiovascular and Respiratory Health."

The Chemical Biology Training Program (CBTP) is a new interdisciplinary predoctoral training program at the
University of California at Berkeley. The CBTP will be the only training program at UC Berkeley focusing on
chemistry-driven approaches to biomedical research. The CBTP will recruit and appoint 12 trainees per year to
train in the field of chemical biology, drawn from a pool of 1378 applicants and 117 matriculants per year in the
Chemistry and Molecular and Cell Biology PhD programs. Trainees will be appointed for one-year terms and
will continue to engage with the CBTP training activities and community-building events through to graduation.
We aim to have at least 20% of our trainees coming from historically excluded groups (HEGs), including racial
and ethnic minorities and students who self-identify as having a disability. We expect that 100% of our students
will graduate with a PhD within 6 years, with a target mean time to degree of 5.5 years for all students, and
with no differential between students from HEG and non-HEG backgrounds. Our goal is that every student will
publish a first or co-first author paper in a peer-reviewed journal recognized as excellent in the field of chemical
biology, and will subsequently pursue a research-related career in academia, industry, or government.
Professional development will be centered on the acquisition of six core competences designed to enable
leadership in any of these workforce sectors. Training procedures will be informed by the latest scientific
literature in the field of research mentorship and training, and will emphasize the acquisition of self-efficacy and
sense of belonging. Research training will be enhanced in response to the latest advances in chemical biology,
including the rapidly growing importance of translational chemical biology to drug development. A series of
training innovations have been incorporated into the CBTP, including establishing academic-industrial
partnerships and the creation of a new academic unit focused on Molecular Therapeutics, and structured
mentoring environment with student peer mentoring groups and secondary faculty advocates. The
effectiveness of the training program will be rigorously evaluated on an annual basis and advice sought from
newly-constituted student and external advisory groups. Our 45 CBTP training faculty are drawn from 9
different departments at UC Berkeley, and our trainees will be drawn from the Departments of Chemistry and
Molecular and Cell Biology PhD programs. Our faculty are world leaders in their fields and include 10 members
of the National Academy of Sciences and recipients of the Nobel and Wolf Prizes in Chemistry. All CBTP
faculty undergo formal mentorship training and evaluation of mentoring quality."

10811614,"I am a Nephrologist and junior clinical researcher at the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center, an
academic VA medical center affiliated with the HSR&D Center for Innovations in Quality, Effectiveness and
Safety. My long-term career goal is to become an independent VA clinical researcher focused on improving
cardiovascular (CV) and kidney outcomes in Veterans with chronic kidney disease (CKD). My short-term goals
are to conduct initial studies to determine the effects of diuretics on relationships between extracellular volume
(ECV), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal-pro-BNP (NT-pro-BNP), symptoms, CV hemodynamic
parameters, and outcomes in Veterans with CKD, and to complete training in conducting a clinical trial, CV
and cardiorenal study design, use of bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) measurements of ECV, and advanced
scientific appraisal. To complete the proposed projects and to ensure that I have the training to compete for VA
Merit Review, I have designed a comprehensive plan including hands-on mentorship, coursework, conference
attendance, and experiential learning to address these specific content areas. I have assembled a diverse team
of mentors dedicated to my career development to oversee the scientific and training aims of this proposal.
 We will use a translational science model to address our central hypothesis, that starting or increasing
diuretics in Veterans with CKD is associated with changes in patient-level factors, CV physiology, and
population-level outcomes. In the first study, we will determine if initiation of diuretic treatment or increase in
dose is associated with changes in BNP and NT-pro-BNP, patient-reported symptom burden, and short-term
hemodynamic parameters in patients with CKD stages 1-3 and elevated blood pressure, and whether these
changes correlate with changes in ECV. This clinical trial will include 46 outpatients with CKD stages 1-3 and
blood pressure >140/90 mmHg. ECV will be measured by BIS, which is a validated, non-invasive, painless
measure of ECV. Plasma BNP and NT-pro-BNP will be measured, and patient-reported fatigue, depression,
and quality of life will be quantified using validated questionnaires. Hemodynamic parameters include blood
pressure, pulse pressure, total peripheral resistance index, and cardiac index measured by Non-Invasive
Cardiac Output Monitoring. A transthoracic echocardiogram will measure left ventricular mass index, valvular
disease, and diastolic dysfunction. At the first visit, I will initiate or increase the dose of a thiazide or loop
diuretic. Study measures other than echocardiogram will be repeated 4 weeks after the intervention to
determine changes in these parameters. We will compare the changes in natriuretic peptides, symptoms, and
CV parameters with the change in ECV. Second, we will determine whether initiation of a diuretic vs. non-
diuretic is associated with CV and kidney outcomes in patients with CKD stages 1-3 and 4-5 using a large, real-
world database of Veterans with CKD. It is considered standard of care that people with CKD should be
prescribed an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) as first-
line treatment for high blood pressure. However, many individuals with CKD wind up needing additional anti-
hypertensive medications, and the best choice of a second-line agent remains unclear. We will address this
question in a retrospective cohort study using the Corporate Data Warehouse database. We will identify
individuals with CKD who were prescribed an ACEi or ARB as their first blood pressure agent, and then
compare CV outcomes between those whose second agent was a diuretic or a non-diuretic.
 These projects will build on knowledge from animal and human studies and identify relationships
between ECV, natriuretic peptides, symptom burden, and CV disease in patients with CKD, particularly in
stages 1-3, when preventive interventions may have the greatest impact. The proposed training plan will ensure
successful completion of these projects. Ultimately the knowledge gained from these studies will support VA
Merit applications to determine whether natriuretic peptides can guide diuretic therapy in patients with CKD."
10811616,"Project Summary
Faces often convey a wealth of information and processing the human face is at the focal point of most social
interactions. When we see a person's face, we can easily recognize their unique identity and general features
such as race, gender, and age. The gestalt of facial processing enables us to make judgments about a
person's mood or other aspects such as their level of trustworthiness. Yet, this simple perceptual task is difﬁcult
for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a population that spends limited amounts of time engaged
in face-to-face eye contact or social interactions in general. Although there is a large body of literature on face
perception and many studies have documented abnormal face processing in people with ASD, most existing
studies focus on the recognition of faces and emotional expressions or on perception of a particular social
attribute (e.g., trustworthiness). It remains largely unclear how the brain represents and evaluates faces in
general, and whether/how this mechanism differs in ASD. The study of face processing in ASD is very
important because it will not only help us understand the social deﬁcits of this disorder but also provide a
unique opportunity to study the factors related to the functional specialization of normal face processing.
 In this project, we propose to conduct one of the very ﬁrst studies to investigate neural face
representation in individuals with ASD and delineate those brain regions involved in coding facial features.
Importantly, by using concurrent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and eye tracking and taking
advantage of recent advances in deep neural networks (DNNs), we are able to extract association-based
features from any face and synthesize new faces for validating model predictions. The primary objectives of
this research are two-fold: (1) to establish a general neural representation of faces by constructing and
validating neural face models, and (2) to compare neural representations of faces between people with ASD
and controls. The collaboration between cognitive neuroscience and computer science in this project provides
a unique opportunity to better understand how individuals with ASD perceive human faces, speciﬁcally what
brain mechanisms are involved in representing faces in general. Obtaining this level of understanding of the
neural computational underpinnings of face representation will be unique to our understanding of face
processing in controls without ASD as well as those with ASD. In turn, this research may provide insights into
the developmental trajectory of this pervasive deﬁcit in autism and potential targets for intervention."
10811738,"Pathologically Late onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by extracellular amyloid plaques composed
by aggregated Amyloid b and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles made of hyperphosphorylated TAU protein
(encoded by MAPT gene). Recently, it has been shown that in human and mouse brain, tau co-
immunoprecipitated with proteins and small RNAs that play a key role in in RNA modification and pre-mRNA
splicing. It has been shown that cytosolic and nuclear tau aggregates are enriched for small nuclear RNAs
(snRNAs) and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) including SNORD115 and SNORD116 families of C/D box
snoRNAs. Our preliminary data demonstrate a significant effect of Braak stage on expression level of snoRNAs
and snRNAs in brain samples from AD patients as compared to controls. We also show that insoluble tau in AD
but not control brains co-immunoprecipitated with selective snoRNAs of C/D box (SNORDs) but not H/A box
(SNORA).
We hypothesize that tau aggregates bind to snoRNAs and snRNAs and affect their traffic between the nucleus
and cytoplasm. snoRNAs, snRNAs and hyperphosphorylated Tau in Tau-RNA complexes lose their physiological
function in RNA processing and chromatin remodeling thus affecting chromatin accessibility and gene expression.
This proposal's primary goal is to explore and demonstrate that selective regional vulnerability in AD brain and
incremental hierarchical spreading of hyperphosphorylated Tau and deposition of NFT are associated and
interconnected with changes in gene expression and chromatin architecture. We will achieve the goal by
interrogating 3 distinct anatomical brain regions at different Braak stages from human subjects and animal models.
Specific Aim 1: To conduct epigenomic and transcriptomic profiling across brain samples at different Braak
stages and to detect tangle-specific changes in gene expression and chromatin structure. We will answer the
question how NFT burden affects chromatin accessibility and gene expression.
Specific Aim 2: To reveal a perturbed transcriptional control of SNORDs hosted on SNURF-SNRPN/UBE2A
region on human Chr15 and to correlate their expression with the progression of AD tau pathology. We will identify
snoRNAs and snRNAs bound to insoluble Tau aggregates and changes in methylation status within Chr15q11-
q13 locus that affect transcriptional activity of SNURF-SNRPN domain.
Specific Aim 3: Using AD mouse models to reveal the effect of hyperphosphorylated Tau and NFT on plasma,
and brain-derived extracellular vesicles’ cargo. We will use PS19 mouse model and examine the effect of tau
pathology in different age groups on the enrichment of snoRNA secreted in extracellular vesicles from brain, ISF,
CSF and plasma."

The overall goal of this research is to better understand the how the kappa opioid receptor (KOR) system
modulates cold hypersensitivity with the ultimate goal of uncovering a novel therapeutic target. Cold pain affects
a number of diverse groups of patients and goes largely untreated. Neuropathic pain with cold allodynia is
estimated to affect 15% to 50% of neuropathic pain patients. For many patients, cold pain is often a side effect
that becomes a chronic debilitating condition. Patients undergoing chemotherapy using platinum-based drugs
report increased sensitivity and pain to cold stimuli. Furthermore, heightened sensitivity to cold is problematic in
those diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. For others, cold pain is part of larger more complex pain condition. The
most commonly reported medications used to treat neuropathic pain are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs), opioids and anti-epileptics, which do not relieve or treat heightened cold sensitivity, primarily because
we do not have clear understanding of the mechanisms involved in the modulation of cold pain. This research
focuses on better understanding the mechanism by which peripheral KORs modulate cold hypersensitivity and
cold pain. The first aim of this proposal will use combined transgenic and pharmacological approaches to assess
the necessity of peripheral KOR expression in the modulation of cold hypersensitivity and cold pain. The second
aim will determine the mechanism by which KORs in dorsal root ganglion can modulate TRPA1 signaling, as
well as determine the necessity of the involvement of TRPA1 channels in KOR mediated cold hypersensitivity.
The third aim will test whether KORs in dorsal root ganglion also modulate TRPM8 signaling. In the final aim,
will use human dorsal root ganglion tissue from organ donors to determine if the KOR-modulation of TRP function
exists in humans. Together, these approaches will allow us to dissect the role of peripheral kappa opioids in cold
hypersensitivity and cold pain. Understanding the mechanisms by which the KOR system modulates cold
hypersensitivity and how this system may also be involved in modulation of cold pain will have major implications
not only in our understanding of basic mechanisms of cold hypersensitivity, but may also open up alternative
therapeutic targets to allow us to treat cold hypersensitivity and pain."

The BM stromal cells (BMSCs) are a key element of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche. However, the
niche is a concept based on spatial localization, whereas the stromal network permeates throughout the entire
BM space, calling into question whether all BMSCs are equally endowed with niche-supporting functions, or
just a subset of a heterogeneous BMSC population. The central hypothesis of this project is that the stromal
cells in different types of BM cavities are functionally distinct, based on our observation that BM cavities are
heterogeneous with respect to their bone remodeling activities. We found cavities that are predominantly
undergoing bone deposition, resorption, or a mixture of the two, and classified them as D-type, R-type or M-
type, respectively. Remarkably, clonal expansion of HSCs both under steady state and after stimulation with
cyclophosphamide and G-CSF is found almost exclusively in M-type cavities. Similarly, early expansion of
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells is also restricted to M-type cavities, underscoring the need to examine
the stromal cells in the context of individual BM cavities undergoing different stages of bone remodeling. Here
we propose to profile BMSCs from distinct cavity types using Image-seq (Aim 1), a new technology developed
in our laboratory for capturing BM cells directly from specific microanatomic locations under image guidance
for single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Combining Image-seq with imaging bone remodeling activity,
we will determine if BMSCs residing in D-, M-, and R-type cavities differentially express genes encoding
factors for niche support and lineage differentiation. In Am 2, we will test the hypothesis that different BM
cavity types are established by distinct stromal progenitor clones. We propose to employ a CRISPR based
barcoding model (CARLIN) to track the progeny of stromal progenitor clones in vivo. The combination of this
clonal tracking strategy with image-seq will provide unique insights into whether restricted stromal clones
influence the R, D, and M cavities in the BM at steady state and after inflammatory challenge. We will further
test if regenerative potential is linked to a specific cavity type by transplanting stroma from individual (D/M/R)
sources to osteoporotic recipients in a fracture healing model. In Aim 3, we will examine if the BMSCs are
interconnected to form a 3D functional network. Our preliminary data show that at least a subset of BMSCs
display spontaneous intracellular calcium transients under steady state, which increase in intensity and
frequency and can turn into intercellular calcium waves (ICWs) upon stimulation. Moreover, the calcium
activity is spatially heterogeneous, with much higher activity in M- and R-type cavities compared to D-type
cavities. We will map the BMSC network activity and investigate the relationship between calcium signaling
and stromal cell function. We will examine whether disruption of calcium signaling in BMSCs leads to an

10814972,"Background. This proposal, which is submitted in response to RFA-AI-21-021 “Understanding
Post-Transcriptional Regulation of Intact and Defective HIV RNA”. N6-methyladenosine
(m6A), is the most common RNA modification and is known to regulate RNA stability, splicing and
nuclear export. m6A modification of HIV transcripts is crucial for the early stages of HIV infection
during acute infection of primary T cells, but it is an open question whether m6A modification
controls HIV latency and reactivation in ART-suppressed patients.
Our goal. Our multidisciplinary team has extensive experience in studies of HIV latency and
reactivation in patients and in reliable primary cell models, studies of RNA m6A modification, and
cutting-edge technologies such as NGS sequencing and scRNA-seq analysis. To overcome the
challenge of measuring m6A in RNA recovered from the extremely low numbers of HIV+ cells
present in patient samples, we will develop a sensitive next-generation sequencing assay for the
profiling and quantification of m6A modification in different HIV transcripts from patient samples.
This assay, which we call MeRIP-EDITS combines methylated RNA immunoprecipation with the
EDITS assay, which has been used in multiple clinical studies to measure the inducible HIV
reservoir. We will use the MeRIP-EDITS assay to characterize m6A modification of different HIV
transcripts at different reactivation kinetic points of latent HIV and examine changes of the m6A
pathway during HIV latency and reactivation. In parallel we will perform mechanistic studies on
the m6A pathway using the QUECEL primary cell model of HIV latency. We will use the model to
develop a sensitive nanopore RNA-sequencing assay which can subsequently be applied to
patient samples. We will also inhibit the activity of the m6A writer METTL3 and the erasers FTO
and ALKBH5 by knocking out the expression of these genes by using the CRISPR gene editing
technology. High resolution mRNA FISH experiments, which distinguish between spliced and
partially spliced HIV mRNA transcripts will be used to study the colocalization of m6A readers and
HIV mRNAs.
How will we advance the field? Demonstration of a central role of m6A in the control of HIV
latency would immediately suggest pharmacological strategies to incorporate into HIV cure
regimens. To date, it has been impossible to efficiently reverse HIV latency using agents that are
designed for “kick and kill” strategies for an HIV cure. Using the sensitive assays described above,
we will evaluate the impact of inhibitors of m6A erasers as part of a “kick and kill” strategy for HIV
latency reversal. As a complementary approach we will also evaluate whether inhibitors of m6A
writers can inhibit HIV reactivation and lead to long term silencing, as part of a “block and lock”
strategy."

A National Pediatric Learning Health System Embedded Scientist Training and Research Program
SUMMARY
Creating integrated learning health systems (LHSs) that improve child health will require a new
generation of pediatric scientists with diverse backgrounds who will be embedded in healthcare
organizations’ clinical and research operations. We propose to address this need by creating a
Pediatric LHS Embedded Scientist Training and Research Center. The Center will be integrated
within PEDSnet, a PCORnet Clinical Research Network and a national pediatric LHS with 11
institutional members that provide care for 10% of the nation’s children. The Center will extend and
enhance the successful PEDSnet Scholars program, which is an AHRQ LHS Center of Excellence
(K12) and has trained 29 junior faculty. The aims for the Center are: Aim 1 (Center Organization and
Integration): Establish a national, pediatric embedded LHS scientist training and research center with
administrative, education and training, research and data analysis, and scientist development cores;
Aim 2 (Scholar Development): Select, retain, and mentor a diverse cadre of pediatric scientists, called
PEDSnet Scholars, who are within 5 years of their initial academic appointment or those making a
mid-career transition, creating a community of national leaders who will help realize the promise of
LHS science for children; Aim 3 (Education Program): Deliver a core curriculum that builds
competence in LHS science with an emphasis on authentic stakeholder engagement and patient-
centered outcomes research; Aim 4 (Research Support): Provide project management, engagement,
methodological, and dissemination and implementation resources and support to PEDSnet Scholars
and their research projects; and, Aim 5 (Program Evaluation): Evaluate the impact of the Center and
its activities on scientists’ professional development and patient and system outcomes. We anticipate
using AHRQ/PCORI funding for 14 individuals and up to an additional 16 can be funded by their
institutions. Scholars will conduct projects that are meaningful, impactful, and outcomes-focused
addressing health and healthcare challenges facing children, their families, and the health systems
that serve them. We have added a Scientist Development Core, which will implement an innovative
Diversity Plan, mentoring, and all activities related to Scholar professional development. The three
MPIs have complementary expertise and are national leaders in LHS science, multi-institutional
research, faculty training, enhancing workforce diversity, and the science of health equity. The
PEDSnet Scholars working within the Center will become institutional and national leaders in
advancing outcomes and the leaders who will forge the national pediatric LHS system of the

The Molecular Analysis of Genomic Instability Core will perform state-of-the-art assays for program
investigators in the analyses of cytogenetic aberrations, and DNA damage responses and repair. These
analyses will complement sequencing results (e.g., examine repetitive regions that are not covered by DNA
sequencing approaches), and provide experimental validation for recurrent genomic instability and
rearrangements identified using genomic approaches (Core C). In addition, the core will perform cell-based
assays to detect and quantify biomarkers for DNA damage and DNA repair pathways, and measure DNA
repair intermediates. Having a dedicated core for this program is beneficial: 1) for cost effectiveness and 2) for
custom designing the experiments based on specific requirement for each of the projects. By centralizing these
services under the leadership of two experienced investigators, Drs. Lorraine Symington and Shan Zha, the
Core will enhance the productivity of the program project members by providing essential services to all
projects, and ensure uniformity of data acquisition and interpretation. The core has two independent specific
aims, which are built upon the expertise of the core leaders. The purpose of Aim 1 is to develop and perform
cytogenetic assays to characterize chromosomal breaks, translocations and copy number changes by
standard G-band karyotyping, spectral karyotyping (SKY), chromosomal painting and locus-specific FISH. In
the second aim, the Core will provide services for automated imaging of DNA damage and response factors,
and will apply quantitative PCR-based assays for detection of ssDNA formed by end resection of site-specific
DSBs in yeast and mammalian cells, and DNA combing method to measure the length of resection tracks on
single molecules from cells treated with irradiation or topoisomerase inhibitors."

10820451,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease, with an estimated
global prevalence of 1 in 4 individuals. No FDA-approved treatments are available. Aberrant transcriptional
control of gene expression is central to the pathophysiology of metabolic diseases. Transcription by RNA
Polymerase II (RNAP2) occurs through several coordinated steps, which include pre-initiation complex
formation and initiation, elongation, and termination. The assembly of the basal transcription machinery and
transcription initiation was believed for many years to be the rate-limiting and most important aspect driving
gene expression. Recent research has revealed that the transition from initiation to elongation is a rate-limiting
and critical step, requiring specific signals to release RNAP2 from its paused state and engage in transcription
elongation. RNAP2 pause-release is a mechanism that allows fast and synchronized gene expression in
response to environmental cues, adjusting expression of entire gene programs. The process of pause-release
requires histone H3 acetylation at lys9 (H3K9ac) in the promoter-proximal region. H3K9ac levels are
significantly altered by high-fat feeding in mice, a model of diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance and NAFLD.
We hypothesize that RNAP2 pause-release is a fundamental mechanism of gene regulation in response to
nutrient availability, and under conditions of nutrient excess, misregulated pause-release contributes to
aberrant changes in gene expression. To study how cells respond to nutrients at the genome-wide level, high-
throughput sequencing technologies will be used. The goals of this proposal will be achieved by pursuing the
following specific aims: (i) Define the role of RNAP2 pause-release in transcription regulation in the fasted to
refed transition; (ii) Determine the mechanism by which the pro-lipogenesis transcription factor Sterol
Regulatory Element Binding Protein 1 (SREBP-1) contributes to regulate transcription elongation; (iii)
Determine how H3K9ac contributes to change gene expression under high-fat conditions. This proposal is
significant because it will identify a novel node of transcription regulation, breaking new ground for drug target
discovery. Thus, this proposal addresses a basic scientific gap in the field of metabolism, and the results of
these innovative studies could lead to the development of new and effective therapeutic interventions for
NAFLD, type 2 diabetes and other associated metabolic diseases."
10820459,"Abstract
 Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a highly prevalent disease for which new therapies are needed. The adipocyte
differentiation and lipid storage pathways are involved in rare and common forms of diabetes and are targeted
by thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are efficacious but cause undesirable complications. Designing better
therapies to target adipocyte differentiation/lipid storage is impeded by incomplete knowledge of which genes
in these pathways are relevant to T2D in humans, or how they might be modulated to achieve therapeutic
efficacy. Disease-associated rare coding variants directly identify human disease-relevant gene modulations,
and our recent study of 45,231 exomes suggested that such associations are likely observable within many
genes within the adipocyte differentiation and lipid storage pathways. However, rare variant associations
require large datasets to detect, and methods are currently lacking to identify which observed associations are
most likely to (a) represent causal links to disease and (b) act through effects on a pathway of interest. The
proposed project will address these gaps under the hypothesis that T2D-susceptibility rare coding variants
that modulate the adipocyte differentiation/lipid storage pathways should impair these processes in vitro and
predispose in vivo to an “insulin resistance signature” of higher T2D risk, higher BMI-adjusted fasting insulin
levels, higher triglyceride levels, lower hip circumference, and lower HDL levels.
Specific aim 1 hypothesizes that larger exome datasets will identify new gene-level rare coding variant
T2D associations, and that prior knowledge of gene function should affect the likelihood each association is
causal. Coding variants in 150K-600K exomes will be tested for association with T2D and insulin resistance,
and each gene's probability of causal association will be calculated by a new method to account for its
empirically estimated prior likelihood of association. Specific aim 2 hypothesizes that genes associated with
an insulin resistance signature in vivo should have a higher likelihood of impairing adipocyte differentiation/lipid
storage when ablated in vitro, and that within these genes, only variants that fail to complement effects
observed in vitro should increase T2D risk in vivo. Fifty genes with gene-level T2D associations will be
screened via loss-of-function experiments in human pre-adipocytes, and genetic complementation experiments
will be conducted for 50 variants in each of 5 genes whose ablation impairs adipocyte differentiation/lipid
storage.
 Significance: T2D-associated coding variants with in vitro effects on adipocyte differentiation or lipid
storage would suggest molecular gene perturbations to protect from or treat T2D. These and all other results of
the project will be made publicly accessible through the NIDDK-funded AMP-T2D Knowledge Portal. The
proposed approaches also apply to other biological processes and diseases."

accumulation of misfolded proteins which is detrimental to the cell. This is underscored by the fact that numerous
human diseases from cystic fibrosis to neurodegeneration are caused by defects in ER proteostasis. Historically,
the field has focused on how ER protein misfolding is sensed and rectified resulting in the detailed
characterization of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and ER-associated degradation (ERAD); pathways that
aim to mitigate protein misfolding. However, whether processes exist that prevent ER protein misfolding in the
first place were largely unknown. Recent studies indicate the presence of a surveillance system that acts during
protein synthesis to tune ER protein translation based on the status of the ER proteome. This process, termed
pre-emptive ER quality control relies on local regulation of translation at the ribosome to modulate the biogenesis
of ER proteins and ubiquitin dependent degradation of misfolded proteins prior to ER insertion. Therefore, pre-
emptive ER quality control oversees translation to prevent folding defects. Because this system is powerful way
to maintain a pristine ER proteome without eliciting the UPR or ERAD, mechanisms that activate this process
may be pursued to advance therapies for a variety of diseases caused by protein misfolding. However, we do
not know the identity of the molecules or mechanisms regulating pre-emptive ER quality control. This level of
understanding is critical to develop a framework understanding how ER proteostasis defects cause disease.
 In ongoing studies in my lab, we have found that UBXN1 is a new modulator of pre-emptive ER quality
control. UBXN1 is best studied as an adaptor to the p97 ATPase, a critical player in ERAD and a major research
focus of my group. In cells lacking UBXN1 we find a significant upregulation of many ER proteins and robust
activation of the unfolded protein response. Our studies suggest that UBXN1 represses translation. Surprisingly,
UBXN1 does not function in ERAD and its role in translation is independent of p97. The objective of this proposal
is to characterize this new role of UBXN1 as a pre-emptive ER quality control factor. We will test the central
hypothesis that UBXN1 interacts with unique ribosomal proteins in a ubiquitin-dependent manner to regulate the
specific translation of ER proteins. We will further investigate the pathway through which translation impacts
UPR activation. In Aim 1 we will identify the mechanisms by which UBXN1 regulates translation, in Aim 2 we will
delineate the pathway through which UBXN1 represses the UPR, and in Aim 3 we determine whether UBXN1
enables selective translation of ER proteins. The proposed work is conceptually innovative as we do not fully

how UBXN1 maintains ER proteostasis by modulating translation. Successful completion of these studies will

Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is a chronic disease caused by autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic
beta cells, and there is currently no treatment that reverses the disease. Many T1D reversal approaches have
failed in human clinical trials and thus an ongoing and urgent need exists for novel therapies targeting new
immune pathways. We have exciting data showing that a TLR4/MD2 agonistic antibody (TLR4-Ab) permanently
reversed T1D in 71%, and induced a significant clinical effect in 90%, of acutely diabetic non-obese diabetic
(NOD) mice. Recently, we showed that TLR4-Ab can mobilize and activate myeloid-derived suppressor cells
(MDSC) that suppress T cells and reverse T1D upon adoptive transfer. We showed that TLR4-Ab remains
sequestered in endosomes, unlike the TLR4 agonist LPS (which cannot reverse T1D). However, the mechanism
by which TLR4-Ab reverses T1D remains unclear. Herein, we propose mechanistic studies to determine the
structural and immune basis of TLR4-Ab reversal of T1D. We have also produced anti-human TLR4 antibodies
which will allow us to apply these finding to human T1D.We will achieve this in three aims. Specific Aim 1.
Mechanism of T cell suppression and reversal of T1D by TLR4-Ab-induced MDSCs. We hypothesize that
TLR4-Ab endosomal sequestration causes sustained endosomal signaling that induces MDSC maturation. We
will test this by inhibiting endosomal and surface signaling in myeloid cells while treating with TLR4-Ab and
testing effects on MDSC phenotypes, T cell suppression, and ability to reverse T1D. Specific Aim 2.
Mechanistic role of Fc structure in TLR4-Ab reversal of T1D and cell suppression. We hypothesize that
the IgG3 Fc portion of the TLR4-Ab is critical to its tolerizing function. We will test this by assaying TLR4-Ab
F(ab), F(ab)2, and deglycosylated TLR4-Ab in functional assays and on T1D. We will switch the TLR4-Ab Fc
from IgG3 to IgG4 subclass to definitively confirm whether IgG3 is required for endosomal sequestration, MDSC
formation, T cell suppression and T1D reversal. Specific Aim 3. Characterization of a novel panel of human
anti-TLR4 antibodies. We have developed agonistic human recombinant TLR4-Abs (hTLR4-Ab). We show here
that these hTLR4-Abs bind TLR4-MD2 and can activate the NF-KB signaling pathway. Our hypothesis is that
human TLR4-Ab treatment will induce MDSCs from myeloid cells and that these huMDSCs will suppress human
T-cell proliferation and activation. Our studies will characterize a novel innate immune pathway by which TLR4-
Ab can reverse acute T1D, and begin to translate these findings to human T1D. This proposal describes a
thorough training plan to support my scientific and professional development as an Immunologist."

Critical maturation steps of mammalian heart development take place during the first few weeks after birth.
During this time, cardiomyocytes undergo critical changes in cell structure, metabolism and gene expression, all
which are essential for the proper function of the heart. CM are in contact with different cell types including
fibroblasts, which have been identified as key central regulators of ventricular maturation and remodeling during
both development and injury. However, the pathways utilized by fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes cells to
communicate during postnatal heart development remain unknown. Recently RNA sequencing identified Growth
differentiation factor 10 (GDF10), also known as Bmp3b, as an upregulated ligand in postnatal cardiac fibroblasts
compared to mature quiescent fibroblasts which suggest, GDF10 plays a role in the crosstalk between
cardiomyocyte and fibroblasts during neonatal development. Interestingly, in skeletal muscle, GDF10 is essential
for maintaining myofiber mass maintenance and adult Gdf10 null mice develop left ventricle hypertrophy.
Further, single-cell sequencing of fat cells found GDF10 to directly modulate PPAR-gamma nuclear abundance
and transcriptional activity, which is known to be important for cardiac energy shift in cardiomyocyte, suggesting
that GDF10 might be important for mitochondrial maturation during heart development. However, the exact role
of GDF10 in the proper maturation of the heart remains to be defined. Our preliminary studies indicate that in
vitro treatment with GDF10 induces size increase and a switch towards mature myosin isoform expression in
neonatal cardiomyocyte which suggests that GDF10 action during cardiac development might be important for
proper maturation. Further, gene expression profiling of neonatal cardiomyocyte and fibroblasts revealed
fibroblast expressed GDF10 to strongly correlate with Activin receptor expression on cardiomyocytes, which
have been implicated in GDF family signaling in cardiomyocytes. Finally, our preliminary studies show that gdf10
null hearts at postnatal day 7 have myocardial growth defects similar to hypoplastic left heart syndrome. The
central hypothesis of this proposal is that cardiac fibroblast secreted GDF10, signaling through activin
receptors, is essential for cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and mitochondrial maturation during
development. Aim 1 will determine if GDF10, through Smad 1/5/8 signaling induces cardiomyocytes
hypertrophy and mitochondrial maturation. In parallel, bulk RNA-sequencing of GDF10, activin receptor inhibitor
ACE031 and GDF10+ACE031 treated cardiomyocyte cells will give us an in-depth understanding of direct
GDF10 targets that induce CM maturation. In Aim 2, we will determine whether GDF10 signaling is required for
CM hypertrophy and metabolic maturation in vivo by extensively examining gdf10 null hearts and measuring
changes in cardiomyocyte cell size and sarcomeric assembly. Additionally, we will evaluate fetal and adult
metabolic and contractile protein gene expression of Gdf10 null mice compared to controls. Our long-term goal
is to determine GDF10 as a key crosstalk ligand between fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes in the mammalian
postnatal cardiac development and if the loss of this communication impairs maturation of cardiomyocytes by
decreasing cardiomyocyte hypertrophy."

Animals learn to predict rewards to maximize their fitness. Rewards often follow environmental cues and/or
actions performed by animals. How do animals learn and remember the associations between cues/actions and
salient outcomes such as rewards? One possibility is that they remember prospective associations, i.e., how
often does reward follow a specific cue/action? Another possibility is that they remember retrospective
associations, i.e., how often does a specific cue/action precede reward? Though these possibilities may sound
similar, they are in fact dissociable, and likely have different behavioral functions. The common view of learning
and memory is that animals only acquire prospective associations. Accordingly, it is well known that many
neurons in the brain encode prospective associations. Nevertheless, whether the brain also stores retrospective
associations was unknown. We recently showed that different neuronal subpopulations in the mouse
ventral/medial orbitofrontal cortex (vmOFC), a key regulator of reward learning, encode prospective and
retrospective associations between a cue and reward. Along with other recent findings, this demonstrated that
the brain stores both prospective and retrospective associations in memory. Nevertheless, how these memories
manifest in neuronal activity during the course of learning and whether these memories are encoded by different
neural circuits to differentially control behavior are unknown. Here, we propose to investigate this overarching
question through three specific aims. First, how do neurons acquire activity representing prospective and
retrospective cue-reward associations? Is such activity acquired in distinct directions or the same direction for
the two associations (i.e., forward from cue to reward and/or backward from reward to cue)? We will address
this question using two-photon calcium imaging to longitudinally track activity of the same neurons over days of
behavioral learning. This will allow us to study activity acquisition of individual neurons over behavioral learning.
These experiments will determine whether blocking specific directions of learning may block the formation of
specific types of memories. Second, can cue-action-reward learning differentially recruit prospective or
retrospective memories in vmOFC based on the training history of an animal? We will address this question by
biasing animals to either a prospective or a retrospective learning strategy during behavioral training. Throughout
such learning, we will record the activity of the same vmOFC neurons. These experiments will determine whether
different individuals can acquire different memories during the same behavior. Lastly, do different vmOFC output
circuits to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) or the nucleus accumbens (NAc), both key regulators of learning,
encode distinct prospective or retrospective memories to differentially control behavior? We will study this
question using projection-specific imaging and optogenetics to test the causal function of these different circuits.
Overall, these experiments will uncover novel mechanisms by which OFC circuits regulate reward learning."

10825514,"Gastrointestinal and cardiovascular health are intimately linked, yet the mechanism by which diet-derived lipid metabolites and the gut microbial flora impact efferent sympathetic nerve activity is largely unknown. Work from our laboratory and others’ provides increasing evidence that the enteric nervous system directly influences the sympathetic control of systemic blood pressure. The viscerosensory-sympathetic network is a functional neural circuit connecting afferent sensory fibers of the gut and efferent vasoconstrictor neurons at the level of the spinal cord. While this neural circuitry likely influences systemic blood pressure in able-bodied individuals, its role in the development of severe hypertensive crises in patients living with spinal cord injury (SCI) is irrefutable. Autonomic dysreflexia (AD) is often a clinical emergency in SCI individuals and is characterized by paroxysmal hypertension in response to otherwise innocuous visceral stimuli (e.g. fecal impaction). Despite its obvious significance, mechanisms involved in the regulation of viscerosensory-sympathetic reflexes (VSSRs) are poorly understood. Our preliminary studies indicate that C-fiber sensory neurons expressing transient receptor potential cation channel V1 (TRPV1) are involved in the afferent limb of the viscerosensory-sympathetic circuitry. Our proposal seeks to (Aim 1) provide a mechanistic understanding of the role of diet-derived lipid mediators in exaggerating the AD phenotype, (Aim 2) interrogate novel therapeutic strategies for attenuating sympathetic hyperreflexia following SCI, and (Aim 3) define the role of SCI-associated gut dysbiosis in contributing to the production of pathogenic diet-derived lipid mediators. Our central hypotheses identify new pathogenic factors (dietary fatty-acid content and SCI-associated dysbiosis) and a biochemical mechanism (diet-derived TRPV1 lipid ligands) that may be independent targets for therapeutic intervention. Uniquely, our rationally designed therapeutic strategies target the major underlying cause of AD (i.e. visceral C-fiber hypersensitivity) rather than the symptomatic outcome (i.e. acute hypertensive crisis) and thus constitute a major paradigm shift."

Initial management of gastroparesis includes dietary modifications and prokinetic and/or
antiemetic medications; however, these tend to lose efficacy over time and are often associated
with intolerable side effects. Surgical therapy for gastroparesis is typically pursued once
maximal medical therapy is no longer efficacious and may include gastric electrical stimulation,
gastric bypass or subtotal gastrectomy in most cases. Disruption of the gastric pyloric sphincter
(pyloroplasty, pyloromyotomy) has recently shown promise as a stomach-preserving option that
does not involve the significant anatomical rearrangement required of gastrectomy. Per-oral
pyloromyotomy (POP) is a novel endoscopic surgery that has shown promising utility for the
management of medically refractory gastroparesis in several small single center studies. This
intervention involves the division of the gastric pylorus via an endoscopic approach,
accomplishing the same functional outcome of laparoscopic or open pyloromyotomy, without the
invasiveness of open or laparoscopic surgery. Prior non-comparative retrospective studies have
demonstrated both improvement of gastroparesis symptoms and improved gastric emptying. To
date, there have been no prospective studies evaluating the efficacy of this procedure or
comparisons to a control procedure. We aim to explore the utility of POP in producing
symptomatic relief of gastroparesis-related symptoms as evaluated by validated scoring
systems (Objective 1) and objective gastric emptying as measured by solid-phase scintigraphic
gastric emptying studies (Objective 2). The proposed research is innovative in that it would
additionally control for the placebo effect by blinding patients to receiving POP versus a sham
intervention. This contribution would be significant as traditional gastroparesis therapies do not
adequately address the clinical need, and supports the mission of the NIDDK to assess new
therapeutic options in clinical trials. POP represents a potential intervention with far greater
safety profile and less morbidity compared to other surgical modalities."

The periosteum, a highly specialized tissue microenvironment on the outer surface of bone, has a key role in
ensuring the survival and self-renewal of a unique population of resident stem/progenitor cells that are
responsible for appositional bone formation and fracture repair. Injuries that disrupt periosteal function are
common, with 12-15 million fractures occurring yearly in the US that lead to 18 million doctor’s visits and result
in 60 million workdays lost. Although most fractures heal successfully, due in large part to the innate
regenerative capacity of the periosteum, healing is slow and ineffectual (nonunion) for more than 5% of
patients, and failure to heal can be as high as 10% for fractures that occur in weight-bearing long bones that
are crucial for mobility. Recalcitrant fractures are challenging to treat and current therapies produce
unpredictable outcomes, leaving almost 600,000 patients each year with significant disability. Unpredictability
in healing is compounded for procedures that aim to replace large areas of bone lost during trauma or tumor
resection and require bone grafting; almost half of the 500,000 bone grafting surgeries performed each year
fail over time, due in large part to the absence of live periosteal cells that orchestrate the new bone formation
needed to successfully unite the graft to the host bone. Our published work identifies BMP2 as a potent
physiological regulator of periosteal function. Mice lacking BMP2 expression in Prx1+ stem/progenitor cells
exhibit severe defects in all known periosteal activities. In the absence of BMP2, bones fail to grow in width
proportional to their growth in length, creating structural instability that results in spontaneous fracture; once
fractured, the periosteum fails to initiate repair and cannot support bone graft incorporation. In addition,
treatment with anabolic agents such as intermittent PTH or anti-sclerostin antibody fail to stimulate cortical
bone formation in the absence of periosteal BMP2. As such, we hypothesize that the dynamic
spatio/temporal expression pattern of Bmp2 within the periosteal niche constitutes an essential
mechanism determining active versus quiescent states of the periosteum throughout postnatal life. We
propose 3 aims to test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will validate the functional role of pathways identified in a
recently completed periosteum RNAseq as downstream mediators of BMP2 signaling during appositional
growth and fracture repair. In Aim 2, we will examine the requirement for BMP2 resident in the ECM of the
periosteal niche versus BMP2 produced by periosteal cell during appositional bone growth. In Aim 3, we will
determine if increasing endogenous BMP2 production by periosteal cells is beneficial for periosteal function.
Completion of these studies will result in a more in depth understanding of the cellular and molecular
mechanisms coordinated by BMP2 signaling in periosteal stem/progenitor cells, and should lead to the
development of novel therapies for enhancing bone repair. Knowledge gained through this proposal also has
the potential to increase the utility of anabolic agents targeted to the periosteum to prevent fractures."

The skeleton is a dynamic, mineralized organ composed of many tissues with a variety of vital functions. Over
the past few years, powerful new approaches have revealed unexpected complexities regarding the sources and
differentiation of cells that create and maintain the skeleton but have also opened exciting avenues of research.
These areas of investigation may lead to novel treatments for devastating conditions such as osteoporosis,
osteopetrosis, bone cancer, and genetic disorders of the skeleton. The goal of the 2024 Bones & Teeth Gordon
Research Conference (B&T GRC) is to bring together investigators and trainees focused on a variety of areas
in skeletal research to discuss and evaluate the latest findings. A broad range of areas will be highlighted,
including identification of stem and progenitor cells that participate in mineralized tissue development,
maintenance, and disease. We will also discuss recent advances in rare diseases that affect the skeleton, how
bones and teeth respond to mechanical loads, and how cells in these tissues communicate under physiological
and pathological conditions. Our program will include a diverse set of speakers from all career stages. As in the
past, this conference will prioritize participation of trainees and promote their interaction with established leaders
in the field with the goal of building productive and lasting collaborations. Based on the successful Gordon
Research Seminar (GRS) that preceded the B&T GRCs in previous years, the GRC organization has approved
a GRS associated with the 2024 B&T GRC. The 2024 B&T GRS, organized by Carolyn Chlebek and Tim
Herpelinck, will be called ""Revolutionizing Skeletal Biology: New Horizons and Technological Advances"". The
meeting will highlight emerging technologies that have significantly advanced skeletal biology research. GRS
will also feature a mentorship program that provides guidance to early-stage scientists on career development.
This year, the mentorship component will be called “A Guide to Impactful Research”. Selected mentors will form
a panel focused on research impact ranging from academic excellence, translational potential and valorization
to scientific outreach. The organizers will select talks from submitted abstracts, and all attendees are encouraged
to present posters and stay for the subsequent GRC. Based on previous experiences, young scientists are
excited by GRS participation and remain highly engaged at the GRC."
10825571,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cell migration is critical to development and disease, and yet yet our understanding for this complex dynamic
event is rather limited. Cell culture studies have uncovered crucial regulators of actin cytoskeleton, including the
Rho family of GTPases (RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42), that influence particular processes of cell migration. However,
in vivo activities of these regulators and how they coordinate to promote efficient cell migration are not
understood in detail. The long-term goal is to understand the molecular mechanisms that coordinate directed
cell migration. To achieve this goal, the overall objective of this proposal is to determine how Cdc42ep1, an
effector protein for Cdc42, interacts with other actin regulators to coordinate neural crest cell migration. Recent
study from the lab revealed that Cdc42ep1 is essential in directed migration of neural crest cells during Xenopus
embryogenesis. Using this in vivo cell migration system, two subcellular pools of Cdc42ep1 were revealed, one
at the protrusive front and the other at the cell body and rear. These two pools of Cdc42ep1 interacts with Cdc42
and septin filaments, respectively, and these interactions can influence the balance of Cdc42ep1 between the
two cytoplasmic pools. Therefore, the central hypothesis for this proposal is that Cdc42ep1 coordinates Cdc42-
mediated membrane protrusion at the leading edge and the septin-actin cytoskeleton organization at the trailing
edge to promote directed neural crest cell migration. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the
following three specific aims: 1) Determine the feedback regulation between Cdc42 and Cdc42ep1 and its impact
on polarized actin dynamics and directed neural crest cell migration; 2) Determine the mechanisms of
cooperation between Cdc42ep1 and septin filaments in controlling cell polarity and directional migration of neural
crest cells; and 3) Determine the function and mechanism of septin filaments in regulating the formation and
contractility of actin stress fibers. This work is a close collaboration with Tsygankov lab, where a morphodynamic
cell migration model will be developed to test various molecular mechanisms and guide further experimental
designs. By tightly integrating the in vivo and in silico experiments in a quantitative manner, the proposed
research will uncover the mechanisms of how Cdc42ep1 integrates activities of Cdc42 and septin to organize
actin dynamics at the protrusive front and the retractive rear to promote neural crest cell migration. This study
will fill the knowledge gap of how local cytoskeletal arrangements are coordinated in directed cell migration. This
knowledge is not limited to neural crest migration, but can be applied to other migration processes to provide a
mechanistic understanding of in vivo cell migration in general. Therefore, the study will not only be critical for
understanding the development of neural crest related birth defects, but also help improve our understanding of
numerous human diseases that involve dysregulated cell migration in other contexts."

10827431,"Abstract
Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE) is a brain injury occurring in ~5/1000 newborns. In 2005, the NIH
Neonatal Research Network (NRN) established therapeutic hypothermia (TH), cooling patients in the first 6
postnatal hours to 33-34°C for 72 hours, as the standard treatment for HIE in high-income countries. However,
many patients still experience adverse outcomes (death or cognitive Bayley Scales of Infant Development <85)
by 18-22 months. Thus, from 2008 to 2015, the NRN tested if deeper, longer, or later TH further reduced adverse
outcomes, with two trials in 21 sites. Unfortunately, results were inconclusive and further progress has been slow,
largely because adverse outcomes cannot be reliably assessed until 18-22 months. To expedite therapeutic
innovations and assess the impact of novel therapies in a more timely manner, there is an urgent but unmet
need to establish a neonatal biomarker of 18-22 month adverse outcomes. To address this gap, the NRN
developed such a biomarker using neuroradiological expert scoring of brain injury on clinically acquired neonatal
brain magnetic resonance images (MRIs), known as the NRN MRI score. In one dataset with one reader,
sensitivity/specificity for adverse outcomes was 81%/78%. However, in another dataset with two readers, the
inter-reader agreement was only moderate and specificity for adverse outcomes was only 56-69%. Questions
arise for whether this subjective and time-consuming scoring system is reliable or fully characterizes complex
HIE injury patterns. Also in many countries, there are no experts available to perform MRI scoring. Finally,
important clinical data elements such as birth weight, sex, APGAR scores, socioeconomic status, and aspects
of the clinical exam are not fully integrated into the scoring system. Our overall hypothesis is that Artificial
Intelligence (AI) algorithms on neonatal brain MRI and clinical data elements can provide higher sensitivity and
specificity than the expert NRN MRI scores in predicting adverse HIE outcomes by 18-22 months. Our R61 Aims
are as follows: Aim 1, Compile a large HIE dataset (N=430) from two completed NRN multi-site HIE trials; Aim
2, Develop an AI biomarker of outcome using neonatal brain MRI, and compare with NRN scores with Aim 2a
focusing on MRI injury patterns and Aim 2b focusing on whole brain MRI signal intensity patterns; and Aim 3,
Develop an AI biomarker of outcome combining clinical and MRI data, and compare with NRN scores. Go/No-
Go criteria for the R33 is if at least one biomarker (2a, 2b, or 3) outperforms NRN MRI scores in our N=430
cohort (p<0.05; DeLong Test of AUC). The R33 Aim 4 is to further evaluate accuracy and reliability in a new
cohort (N=231). Deliverables: Publicly released data and the AI software. Impact: A brain MRI and clinical AI-
powered neonatal prognostic biomarker could expedite therapeutic innovations in future HIE trials worldwide."
10792666,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Cholestatic fibrogenesis is a pathobiological process of the bile ducts, characterized by biliary strictures,
cholestasis, and progressive peri-portal fibrosis. During biliary fibrosis, diseased cholangiocytes become
highly secretory, releasing a variety of paracrine signaling molecules that subsequently activate hepatic
stellate cells (HSC). Progression toward end stage disease is characterized by an exaggerated fibrogenic
response to chronic injury, culminating in peri-portal deposition of matrix molecules that progresses to
biliary cirrhosis. We have also shown that the cholangiocyte secretome, which mediates the crosstalk,
depends heavily on regulatory mechanisms involving epigenetic enzymes and long non-coding RNAs
(lncRNAs) to modify chromatin. The ensuing histone modifications in cholangiocytes drive transcription of
pathological gene networks that perpetuate fibrosis. The novel direction described here supports the
concept that TGF-β induced lncRNAs in cholangiocytes can serve either as decoy lncRNAs to prevent
engagement of chromatin silencers (e.g., enhancer of zeste homologue 2, EZH2) or as guide lncRNAs to
engage chromatin activators (e.g., lysine acetyl transferase 2A, KAT2A). We have generated the following
novel preliminary data: i) Pathologic TGF-β signaling induces upregulation of 267 lncRNAs in
cholangiocytes, including TILC and TGFB2-AS1; ii) A network of cholangiocyte-derived paracrine
activators of HSCs are regulated by histone modifiers and lncRNAs as demonstrated by chromatin
immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and RNA immunoprecipitation
(RIP); iii) Biliary organoids derived from MDR2 knockout (KO) mice demonstrate distinct upregulation of
lncRNAs; and iv) Biliary fibrosis is exacerbated in EZH2 KO mice and blunted in KAT2A KO mice. Based
on this preliminary data, we propose the central hypothesis that dysregulated cholangiocyte lncRNAs
orchestrate the cholangiocyte epigenome to amplify production of a fibrogenic secretome. In Aim I, we will
test the subhypothesis that a decoy lncRNA prevents gene silencing by excluding EZH2 from chromatin.
In Aim II, we will evaluate the subhypothesis that a guide lncRNA recruits KAT2A to chromatin to promote
a fibrogenic secretome. In Aim III, we will investigate the subhypothesis that targeting specific lncRNAs
will prevent fibrogenesis in mouse models and human organoids. In summary, we propose the novel
concept that lncRNA dysregulation influences key epigenetic regulators in cholangiocytes to modify
chromatin and drive transcription of a fibrogenic gene network. Interventions targeting these newly
discovered pathways with RNA therapeutics may have the capability to prevent or reverse specific
molecular events that underlie biliary fibrosis."

Activated CD8+ T cells are capable of responding to tumor neoantigens and can aid in the clearance of tumors.
Indeed, CD8+ T cells are critical for the beneficial effects of immune checkpoint blockade therapies, in those
patients that respond to such therapies (mAb’s to CTLA-4, PD-1/L1, LAG3). In addition, CD8+ T cells themselves
can be deployed as therapies, in the form of CAR-T cells for some hematological malignancies. Other therapeutic
or preventative modalities still under active study include expansion and infusion of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes
(TIL) and vaccination. All of these approaches require either the presence of tumor specific CD8+ T cells whose
function can be augmented or knowledge about a tumor neoantigen that can be directly targeted therapeutically.
Despite advances, there are still significant gaps in knowledge regarding how tumor-specific CD8+ T cells are
primed, how they are recruited to (or excluded from) the tumor, and how they become dysfunctional in the tumor
microenvironment.
 Our understanding of the rules of T cell development, function and antigen discrimination have been greatly
enhanced using T cell receptor transgenic (TCR Tg) mice. These models provide a traceable pool of antigen-
specific T cells that can be studied over the course of an infection. Many investigators have also taken advantage
of TCR Tg T cells to model responses to tumor antigens, by expressing the cognate antigen (e.g. LCMV GP,
OVA) in transplantable tumor lines or genetic tumor models. One of the limitations of such studies is that they
have mostly employed non-tumor antigens and their respective TCR’s, which often represent high affinity outlier
TCR-ligand pairings. There is thus a need for additional models that employ naturally arising tumor neo-antigens
and matching TCR’s.
 One of the most commonly used transplantable murine syngeneic tumor lines in the C57BL/6 background is
MC38, a colon carcinoma model originally derived from C57BL/6 mice treated with methylcholanthrene. A recent
study reported the identification of a tumor neo-antigen in the MC38 model, a mutated form of the ribosomal
protein Rpl18, referred to hereafter as Rpl18*, presented by H-2Kb. We have now validated that this represents
a major T cell epitope in C57BL/6 mice bearing MC38 tumors. We have also identified TCR’s that recognize this
epitope and confirmed that these TCR’s can mediate T cell activation and effector function. We now propose to
use two of the TCR’s that we have identified to generate TCR Tg mouse lines that can be used for future study
of T cell anti-tumor responses in mouse models."
10823509,"ABSTRACT
Mutations in glycine receptor alpha 2 (GlyRα2), an anionic-selective pentameric ligand-gated ion channel, have
been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy. This
receptor plays an important role in neurodevelopment and mediates tonic inhibition in specific regions of the
adult brain. Functional studies have shown that GlyRα2 has slower activation and desensitization kinetics
compared to other GlyR subtypes. However, the precise mechanistic differences between GlyRα2 and other
GlyR subtypes remain unknown. Furthermore, while there is increasing evidence of diverse mechanisms of
lipidic modulation on ion channels, there is a lack of information regarding the lipidic profile of GlyRα2. Given
the importance of lipids in regulating the function of membrane proteins, it is important to investigate the
specific lipidic profile of GlyRα2 and how lipidic modulators affect channel function. The overarching goal of this
study is to examine the structure-function relationship and investigate the allosteric modulation of GlyRα2. The
study is divided into two aims. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that GlyRα2 conformational changes differ from
GlyRα1 upon glycine binding, channel opening, and desensitization. This aim will be assessed using cryogenic
electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and patch-clamp electrophysiology with site-directed mutagenesis. Preliminary
results have shown high resolution structures in distinct conformational states with various ligands. Aim 2 will
test the hypothesis that GlyRα2-specific modulators alter the conformation of the receptor, and that their
specificity is attributed to site-specific or globally distinct features of GlyRα2. These modulators are expected to
induce conformational differences that correspond to changes in the channel's function. Additionally, Aim 2 will
test the hypothesis that GlyRα2 preferentially interacts with different lipid species than GlyRα1, corresponding
to the distinct membrane environments these two channels are found in. This aim will expand our knowledge of
GlyRα2-specific lipidic modulation and the effect lipids have on channel function. Native mass spectrometry will
be used to investigate lipidic interactions, and these findings will be correlated to observable lipid densities
from our cryo-EM structures. Overall, the findings from this study will provide a better understanding of the role
of GlyRα2 in neurogenesis and adult physiology and pathology. In addition, this work will set the stage for the
future development of pharmacologic therapies targeting GlyRα2."

10807347,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) is one of the most effective interventions for maintaining cognitive
functioning and wellbeing of persons living with dementia (PLwDs). CST is currently recommended by the
United Kingdom government for the management and support of PLwDs. Alzheimer's Disease International
(ADI) also recommends CST as an effective intervention. However, providing CST to individuals in need
remains a serious challenge. CST is traditionally provided by trained health professionals, which is costly and
not scalable. Recent work has focused on adapting CST to be provided by care partners at home. However,
current approaches add considerable burden on care partners, which results in low adherence and engagement.
Such adherence and engagement issues undermine the efficacy of CST and consequently, lead to non-optimal
outcomes. As such, irrespective of the established evidence in favor of CST, there remains considerable
challenges in disseminating it at scale, specifically when it comes to individuals living in remote locations.
We argue that voice assistants (VAs) provide an ideal platform to deliver CST at scale. VAs are widely available
given their integration with most recent consumer devices. Recent VAs can support visual displays and voice
interactions — best of both worlds when it comes to designing simple, intuitive, and effective interfaces. More
importantly, significant numbers of older adults actively use VAs. The high adoption and acceptance of VAs
among older adults provides a unique opportunity to support PLwDs and their care partners.
This project aims to advance this vision of leveraging VAs for dementia care support. We will develop a VA to
deliver customized and tailored cognitive stimulation therapy for PLwDs. We will minimize care partner
burden and provide effective support to deliver CST sessions at home. We will follow the Center for eHealth
Research (CeHRes) roadmap to develop the VA, which will result in an iterative and community-driven
implementation process. We will also deploy the VA with 15 dyads (PLwDs and care partners) for 12 weeks.
This will allow us to collect granular interaction, usability, and acceptance data from real-world settings. We
will also conduct focus group interviews to collect in-depth qualitative data.
This project will establish a preliminary evidence base regarding the feasibility and acceptability of using VAs
for dementia interventions. Given the wide adoption of VAs, the project can positively impact a large
population of PLwDs and care partners including those living in remote and rural areas."
10807432,"The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in our veterans puts them at elevated risk of fracture and
fracture-associated death. Nearly 1 of every 3 veterans has CKD, fracture risk in persons with CKD is 4x higher
than the age-matched general population, and persons who fracture with CKD have longer hospitalization and
higher mortality rates than patients without CKD who fracture. The work of my laboratory throughout my career
has been focused on causes of bone fragility and assessment of current and potential future approaches for
strengthening bone to reduce fracture risk. Current work in my laboratory is focused on two key concepts. The
first, supported through my Merit award, is testing the overall hypothesis that reversal of cortical porosity with
enhanced material quality can combine to improve bone mechanical properties in CKD. Using two
complementary animal models of CKD that develop robust cortical porosity, we are using combinations of
clinically relevant therapies and studying the morphological, material and mechanical properties of the bone. A
parallel line of work supported by an NIH-R01 grant is focused on precision medicine approaches to CKD.
Specifically, we are testing the hypothesis in a clinical setting that microRNA can serve as a biomarker for
differentiating the skeletal manifestation of disease. These experiments will utilize novel biomarker analyses in
combination with standard (histological assessment of bone turnover) and cutting-edge (Raman/nano-
indentation assessment of bone quality) approaches that have high translational potential. Collectively, this work
will serve as a platform on which to build a clinical regimen for reducing the skeletal burden and improving the
quality of life of veterans suffering from CKD. Complementary to my research program I have purposefully built
a program focused on institutional/professional service. The goals of this program are to help the next generation
of researchers. As Co-Director of Workforce Development for our Indiana Clinical and Translational Science
Institute I have built/supported programs to assist the workforce ranging from high school through mid-career
faculty. This work, which bridges to our local VA, includes programs to engage socioeconomically disadvantaged
and/or historically under-represented populations gain research experience and programs focused on supporting
early career researchers’ growth toward independence. Through both my research and service, my goal is to
improve health among the Veteran population, and among the public in general, through both my own work and
the work of others."
10807826,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, the most common form of pancreatic cancer, carries a 5-year mortality rate
of 89%. Incidence and mortality from PDAC is rising, such that PDAC will become the second leading cause of
cancer deaths in the US by 2040. Despite a robust increase in PDAC research, clinical progress has been slow
and still reliant on surgery and cytotoxic therapies, with approved targeted therapies against actionable mutations
relevant only to a sliver of patients and virtually no success using immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) PDAC.
PDAC has a highly desmoplastic stroma that promotes tumor survival and treatment resistance. Here we show
that Oncostatin M helps orchestrate this malignant microenvironment of PDAC. OSM belongs to the Interleukin-
6 (IL-6) family and signaling through OSMR and the common receptor, IL6ST/GP130. OSM over-expression
studies in cell lines showed that OSM promotes a stem cell phenotype in pancreatic cancer cells (PCCs).
Recently it was shown that macrophage OSM signals on fibroblasts to promote PDAC growth and metastasis
through heterotypic fibroblast-tumor-macrophage cytokine crosstalk. Our data point to an additional role of
OSMR in PCCs. High OSMR expression in PDAC tumors associates to poor prognosis. We show OSM is feed
forward, with OSM inducing OSMR in both PCCs and tumor fibroblasts. OSM stimulation of PCCs induced
cytokine signaling and changed stem cell, epithelial-to-mesenchymal, and metabolic pathways. OSM caused
compaction of PCC/fibroblast spheroids and altered PCC and fibroblast size, shape, and motility. Orthotopic
implantation of tumor cells showed that host OSM promotes desmoplasia and tumor pathogenesis and that
OSMR depletion in PCCs dramatically reduces tumor growth. Thus, our studies point to an essential role for
host-derived OSM signaling on OSMR in tumor cells, complementing prior knowledge on its role in
fibroblasts and strengthening the case for targeting OSMR in pancreatic cancer. Based upon these
considerable data, we hypothesize that OSMR signaling in PCCs promotes an aggressive, metastatic phenotype
and a compacted and immune incompetent microenvironment through both cell autonomous and non-
autonomous mechanisms. Blocking OSMR signaling in tumors should result in less aggressive PDAC
phenotypes and promote response to therapy. We will test this hypothesis through mechanistic and therapeutic
studies in mouse models and by interrogating human specimens using complementary genomics approaches.
AIM 1: Define functions of pancreatic cancer cell (PCC) OSMR in the tumor microenvironment and
metastasis. AIM 2: Determine the importance of PCC OSMR in response to chemotherapy and
immunotherapy. AIM 3: Define the tumor microenvironment and immune contexture and clinical
outcomes associated with PCC OSMR expression in PDAC tumors."

Loss of both LDLR alleles in homozygous FH (HoFH) causes excessively high plasma cholesterol (~1000 mg/dl), xanthomas, atherosclerosis, and death in the first few decades of life if untreated. Currently, the only curative treatment for HoFH is a liver transplant, making this disease an important priority for gene therapy. Achieving permanent correction of HoFH through gene therapy will require modifying the patient’s own DNA, so that cells expressing LDLR will persist in the liver. In this application we will further expand on our previous work, by developing strategies to integrate a full length LDLR transgene into genomic safe harbor sites. The goal is to ensure that the therapy will be generalizable to HoFH patients, and not specific to a particular mutation or region of the protein. Secondly, we will use FH mouse models to test a new strategy for liver-directed gene therapy through selection expansion of gene-corrected hepatocytes. This approach capitalizes on the regenerative capacity of the liver, and uses endogenous essential gene as a selectable marker. Over time, inhibition of the essential gene can be used to selectively expand gene-targeted hepatocytes, ensuring that liver-wide correction can be achieved. We propose two specific Aims: 1) Determine if targeted integration at the Ldlr and Apoa1 loci can correct FH, and 2) Develop a novel system for selective expansion of gene- corrected hepatocytes. Completion of this work will produce a new gene therapy solutions for HoFH, as well as a universal system for genetic correction of other liver disorders through in vivo selection."
10811736,"The goals of this research plan are to uncover the molecular mechanism by which mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling
promotes pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell migration, invasion and metastasis, and to devise novel
strategies to exploit potential therapeutic vulnerability in metastatic PDAC based on our mechanistic studies.
The Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter (MCU) is the only Ca2+ channel on the mitochondrial inner membrane
responsible for mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. Under certain pathological conditions, MCU-mediated mitochondrial
Ca2+ overload leads to cell death. Paradoxically, MCU levels are significantly increased during the progression
of several types of cancer. In this proposal we use PDAC as a model to study the molecular mechanism by which
MCU controls cancer metastasis and progression. Our data indicated that MCU overexpression in PDAC
promotes PDAC cell migration, invasion and metastasis through a MCU-Nrf2 signaling circuit. Through non-
biased RNA sequencing and interrogation of the TCGA transcriptomic datasets, we identified xCT (SLC7A11,
the functional subunit of the cystine / glutamate antiporter system) as a potentially druggable target in MCU-
mediated anti-oxidant response and PDAC metastasis. Intriguingly MCU overexpressing PDAC cells are
addicted to xCT-mediated cystine uptake. When PDAC cells were deprived of cystine or treated with xCT
inhibitors, MCU promotes ferroptosis, a form of lipid ROS-mediated, iron-dependent regulated cell death. In Aim1
we will use genetically engineered mouse model to investigate the role MCU-Nrf2 signaling in PDAC metastasis
and progression. We will determine the mechanism by which MCU activates Nrf2 in Aim 2 and define cystine
addiction as a therapeutic vulnerability in MCU overexpressing PDAC in Aim 3. The success of this proposal will
provide important mechanistic insight for mitochondrial calcium signaling in PDAC metastasis, and will likely
provide a novel avenue to prevent metastatic recurrence in PDAC."

Respiratory viruses spread from host to host as they are shed from mucosal surfaces and can transmit through
the air or via surface contact. Therefore, it is believed that the induction of a strong mucosal immune defense
cannot only prevent from infection at the port of virus entry, but also affect virus transmission, thereby preventing
new infections. In this proposal, we will address the impact of mucosal adjuvanted vaccination on the outcome
of disease, host immune responses to and transmission events after experimental respiratory infection with
influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2. We will use the guinea pig (influenza) and Syrian golden hamster (SARS-CoV-
2), two established models for vaccination, infection and transmission studies with respiratory viruses. Intranasal
virus inoculation will result in replication mainly in the upper respiratory tract for guinea pigs, whereas SARS-
CoV-2 will replicate in both upper and lower respiratory tract. We will compare protection provided by mucosal
adjuvanted vaccination via the intranasal route to parenteral vaccination via the intramuscular route and will
investigate the impact of induction of protective immune responses at mucosal sites on host immune responses
to infection in vaccinated hosts (hybrid immunity) and virus transmission between vaccinated infected animals
and naïve receiver animals. Despite being vaccine-preventable diseases, transmission of influenza and SARS-
CoV-2 occurs frequently after breakthrough infection of antigenically drifted virus variants in vaccinated people.
For this R21, three principal investigators with complementary expertise in preclinical animal models for
respiratory virus transmission, mucosal adjuvanted vaccines and immune profiling will continue to build on their
previous collaborative efforts and expertise to investigate the potential of an intranasal mucosal adjuvanted
vaccine strategy previously validated in mice. The mucosal adjuvant consists of a nanoemulsion with TLR-
agonistic properties combined with a RIG-I agonist. This combination adjuvant is currently being tested and
compared to other licensed intramuscular adjuvants by us in mice for its suitability as a mucosal adjuvanted
vaccination strategy for universal and supraseasonal influenza and SARS-CoV-2 vaccine antigens. The
efficiency of inhibition of transmission by mucosal vaccination will be compared to parenteral vaccination with
the current standards of care for populations at risk (split inactivated influenza virus vaccine or recombinant
hemagglutinin for influenza and mRNA or adjuvanted recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-based COVID-19
vaccines). We will correlate induced mucosal and systemic immune responses after vaccination with protection
from experimental infection, reduction in transmission to naive receiver animals and enhancement of hybrid
immunity (immunity as a result of vaccination and infection)."

10820471,"Project Summary
Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is a common, genetically complex and age-related degenerative
disease affecting approximately 4 % of the U.S.A. population with a higher incidence in females. In FECD,
corneal endothelial (CE) cell loss is accompanied by extracellular matrix deposition in the form of guttae. My
mentor (Ula V. Jurkunas) has reported explicitly that in FECD, oxidant-antioxidant imbalance due to suboptimum
Nrf-2 regulated antioxidant defense, including a decline in its transcriptional target, NAD(P)H quinone
dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1), leads to oxidative DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis. My
preliminary data also suggests the significant loss of CE in NQO1-/- mice compared to WT in the mouse model
of FECD. Alike oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage, my co-mentor (Albert S. Jun) and others have
implicated the role of ER stress/ Unfolded protein response (UPR) in the pathogenesis of FECD. My preliminary
data also suggests the significant and earlier activation of pro-apoptotic ER stress markers for NQO-/- cell line
after UVA-induced FECD model in vitro. However, there has not been any study linking ER and mitochondrial
stress under oxidant-antioxidant imbalance for CE in FECD. The objective of this proposal is to define the
contribution of ER stress on mitochondrial stress (altered bioenergetics and dynamics) under oxidant-antioxidant
imbalance in FECD. During the mentored phase (K99) of the award, I will determine whether UVA induces ER
and mitochondrial stress (Aim 1a), ER stress alters mitochondrial bioenergetic (Aim 1b) and dynamics
(morphology, fragmentation, translocation) all under oxidant-antioxidant imbalance (Aim 2a). I will learn to induce
and quantify ER stress with my co-mentor lab’s collaboration (Albert Jun), analyze mitochondrial bioenergetics
and dynamics with mentor Ula Jurkunas and co-mentor Pere Puigserver’s lab, learn in vitro and in vivo model of
FECD (Jurkunas’s lab) along with the extensive career development activities offered at Harvard Medical School.
During the R00 phase, with mentor and co-mentor’s support, I will perform uncompleted parts of Aim1-2 with the
additional investigation of the mechanism of ER mediated-activation of mitochondrial intrinsic apoptotic pathway
(Aim 1c) via Ca+2 signaling and microtubular rearrangement (Aim 2b). Collectively, these studies will provide new
insights and perspectives into the ER-Mitochondrial cross talk for corneal endothelial biology, which will advance
our understanding of FECD pathogenesis. A K99 award will allow me to receive additional training in ER and
Mitochondria biology along with novel training in corneal endothelial cell biology. The extensive resources and
career development opportunities available at Harvard Medical School, Jurkunas, Puigserver, and Jun’s lab, as
well as the research activities planned in the K99 phase, will enable me to achieve the long-term goal of
becoming an independent investigator dedicated to the study of ER-Mitochondrial cross talk in corneal
endothelial biology."
10820475,"1 ABSTRACT
 2 This application for the NIH Mentored Research Scientist Development K01 Award proposes a specialized
 3 experience to launch the independent research career of Dr. Daniel J. Amante, PhD, MPH. He will focus on
 4 implementing technology-based behavioral interventions to improve the effectiveness of healthcare delivery and
5 management of type 2 diabetes (T2D). The three-year proposed experience 1.) builds upon an exciting
6 foundation of work, 2.) addresses a clinical need (improving engagement and delivery of diabetes self-
 7 management training), and 3.) is informed by input from clinical, community and patient stakeholders.
 8 Management of chronic diseases is challenging, especially for patients with T2D who have many competing
 9 health demands. Much of T2D management occurs outside of clinical encounters, requiring proficient patient
10 self-care skills. Current evidence-based guidelines recommend diabetes self-management training (DSMT) for
11 all T2D patients. DSMT provides patients with increased access and personalization of support by certified
12 diabetes care and education specialists. DSMT faces significant implementation challenges, however, with very
13 few patients completing training. Latinx patients, a population disproportionately affected by T2D, complete
14 DSMT at especially low rates. Culturally-tailored interventions designed to increase engagement with DSMT in
15 such underserved populations are needed so that negative diabetes-related outcomes are averted.
16 To enhance implementation of DMST, Dr. Amante developed DM-BOOST (Diabetes Mellitus program using
17 Behavioral economics to Optimize Outreach and Self-management support with Technology). The goals of DM-
18 BOOST are to increase patient engagement and experience with DMST using Behavioral Economics-inspired,
19 technology-assisted approaches. DM-BOOST has been developed for English-speaking patients but needs to
20 be culturally-adapted for Spanish-speaking Latinx patients to increase the reach and impact of the program.
21 The specific aims of this project are to culturally adapt DM-BOOST for Latinx patients, usability test ‘DM-
22 BOOST para Latinx’ to optimize cultural appropriateness and patient engagement and conduct a feasibility
23 evaluation of DM-BOOST para Latinx. These aims will be accomplished via a community-based participatory
24 research approach in collaboration with clinical, community and patient partners. This project will inform
25 subsequent proposals to evaluate implementation of DM-BOOST in the UMass Memorial Health Care system.
26 To accomplish these aims, Dr. Amante will be guided by expert mentors and receive specialized training in:
27 1.) cultural adaption of diabetes self-management training interventions for Latinx patients, 2.) innovation with
28 user experience to optimize use of patient-facing health information technologies, and 3.) implementation
29 science to enhance uptake of evidence-based diabetes care services. This career development award will be
30 guided by expert mentors and in collaboration with Dr. Amante’s clinical, community and patient partners."

Unmet Need: Burns have comprised 5-20% of military casualties sustained in post-World War II conflicts.
Burn symptoms vary depending on the severity or degree of the burn, but all burns are painful. There are no
treatments for burn pain available that acts on specific pain receptors on the skin and can be applied topically. Our
goal is to develop one.
Innovation: The Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel is a polymodal protein with
functions linked to the generation of pain. Cutaneous TRPV1 receptor activation in sensory neurons induces
pain and occurs through several mechanisms including thermal injury. Blockage of the TRPV1 receptor through
direct cutaneous application of a topical small molecule antagonist may significantly ameliorate burn pain as this
receptor has been shown in many animal models to be an important gating mechanism in pain and in the
inflammatory cascade.
Serentrix’s lead molecule, SER114, a TRPV1 receptor antagonist, has been successfully tested in Phase 1 clinical
trials for neuropathic pain. As TRPV1 has been shown to be a key receptor involved in the mediation of pain and
inflammation in the skin, our goal is to develop the compound as a novel topically applied small molecule TRPV1
antagonist for the treatment of cutaneous burn pain. As our compound selectively binds to the receptor,
developing a topical formulation would further reduce the chances of adverse effects and provide a dosage form
that can be used for local delivery for topical burns. This makes SER114 a highly innovative drug candidate ideal
for treatment of burn pain by targeting pain receptors present on the skin.
Research Strategy: As TRPV1 has been shown to be a key receptor involved in the mediation of cutaneous
pain, our goal is to develop our compound as a novel topically applied TRPV1 antagonist for the treatment of
cutaneous burn pain."
10785633,"Mapping FTD Tau Amyloid Interactions using a De Novo Designed Soluble Protein
 Amyloids are hallmarks of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Dementias (ADRD). In these diseases, amyloidogenic proteins (e.g., tau) misfold and coalesce to form insoluble deposits, which appear as microscopic lesions in patient brain samples. With cryo-EM advancement, the number of solved high-resolution amyloid structures is on the rise. Each amyloidogenic protein can adopt a number of different three-dimensional amyloid structures, each with distinct molecular repeating structures, which is defined as conformational strains. Interestingly, distinct tau conformational strains are correlated to different clinicopathological presentations of AD and ADRD—strains are homogeneous within a disease type but vary between diseases. There is currently a lack of methods to artificially recreate the AD and ADRD patient-observed conformational strains in the lab, which is a major setback for the study of biologically relevant species and a barrier to understanding the pathological effects of amyloids. This highlights the need for new methods to present the AD and ADRD patient-observed amyloid epitopes. Additionally, amyloids are inherently insoluble, making it difficult to use traditional drug screening methods to identify potential treatments, highlighting the need to generate large quantities of soluble forms for drug development efforts. This proposal aims to create innovative computational tools to rebuild tau amyloid epitopes observed in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) tauopathy patients and validate in situ. The designed proteins will then be utilized to investigate how the tau amyloid epitopes interact with its biochemical microenvironment to elucidate their causal role in tau-mediated pathogenesis and to begin development of effective therapies for FTD tauopathy. The protein design canvas is a β-solenoid supersecondary structural motif which shares characteristics of supramolecular assembly of amyloids such as extensive parallel β-sheet with 4.8 Å spacing. The design focus is to patch FTD patient observed tau amyloid epitope onto a β-solenoid with capping moieties for solubility. I will validate the designed β-solenoid with X-ray crystallography and begin to probe tau amyloid epitope interaction with proteins and metabolites to understand how tau amyloids contribute to pathological events. The ultimate goal is to use these stable tau amyloid epitopes to produce monoclonal antibodies and perform high-throughput small molecule drug screening to identify therapeutics that target conformational strains of FTD tau amyloids."

African American adults and adults from economically disadvantaged environments are at disproportionate risk
for obesity yet are markedly underrepresented in traditional weight management trials and experience lower
weight losses relative to their white and socioeconomically advantaged counterparts. Developing sustainable,
community-based behavioral interventions to address the national obesity crisis is critical in order to mitigate the
alarmingly poor health outcomes faced by underserved populations. Indeed, initiation and maintenance of
healthy lifestyle behaviors presents unique challenges in underserved, economically disadvantaged
communities, but traditional behavioral weight management delivery models largely disregard the social and
cultural assets which exist within these community settings. Moreover, previously tested community-based
interventions have not fully harnessed the potential of community members as agents of change within their
social networks. Thus, the overall objective of this proposal is to test the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary
effectiveness of a grassroots intervention delivery model which includes training community members to recruit
and retain members of their social network and to deliver an evidence-based lifestyle intervention to reduce
adiposity and improve cardiometabolic risk. The specific aims are: 1) to test the feasibility and acceptability of
using house chats (home-based, peer-led focused discussions) as a model for intervention implementation in a
real-world, community-based setting; and 2) to assess the preliminary effectiveness of the house chat intervention
model for promoting change in behavioral (physical activity, diet) and physical (adiposity, fasting glucose, blood
pressure) markers of cardiometabolic risk at post-treatment (12 weeks) and follow up (24 weeks); and 3) to
systematically evaluate—using a mixed methods approach—the facilitators and barriers to sustainability of this
model. The proposed pilot trial will utilize a group randomized controlled design wherein participants are
assigned by ward to either intervention or delayed intervention control. A total of 10 house chat leaders (HCL)
will be recruited and trained (5 HCL in each condition). HCL will recruit members of their social network (N=80, 18-
70 years of age) to participate in an 12-week lifestyle intervention delivered via weekly group meetings in the
house chat leaders’ homes. In-person assessment visits will be conducted by masked research staff at 0, 12
weeks (post-treatment) and 24 weeks (follow-up). Satisfaction will be assessed in-person at 12 weeks (post-
treatment) only via surveys and an exit interview. Facilitators and barriers to sustainability will be assessed via a
mix of in-depth interviews (with house chat leaders), focus groups (with participants) and surveys (with both) at
24 weeks. The proposed intervention delivery model, which draws on community assets and builds capacity,
could offer a viable approach to improve health outcomes for an underserved population. This pilot trial will
provide the first evidence of feasibility and preliminary effectiveness, which will make a meaningful contribution
to the field and inform a larger trial."
10823417,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) incidence is rising. Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms (PanINs) are
PDA precursors that are common in asymptomatic adults, but only few progress to PDA. The critical regulators
of PanIN progression to PDA and metastases remain unknown. KRAS mutations occur in > 92% of human low-
grade PanINs. Pancreatic KrasG12D mutation (mKRAS) in mice (KC mice) induces PanINs that mimic human low-
grade PanINs but fail to progress to PDA. High fat diet (HFD) and pancreatic P53 mutations (e.g., KPC mice)
promote a pancreatic immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (iTME) and PanIN progression to PDA and
metastases in KC mice. Dietary fatty acids are natural activating ligands of peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor-delta/beta (PPARD). PPARD is upregulated in human PDA, but its role in PDA is understudied. We
have found 1) PPARD was upregulated in human and KC mice PanINs; 2) Pancreatic PPARD knockout (KO) in
KC mice suppressed HFD promotion of PanIN progression to PDA; 3) PPARD activation by a HFD diet or diet
containing GW501516, a synthetic PPARD ligand (GW diet), accelerated PanIN progression to PDA in KC mice,
and to a greater extent, in KC/Pd mice with PPARD overexpression in pancreatic mKRAS+ cells; 4) PPARD
induced pancreatic epithelial cells to produce chemokines and cytokines (e.g. CCL2, IL-6, GM-CSF) that
recruited immunosuppressive cells to form an iTME; 5) PPARD KO in KPC cells (KPC-PdKO) suppressed PDA
and metastases while pancreatic PPARD overexpression in KPC mice (KPC/Pd) fed HFD promoted metastases;
and 6) PPARD and platelet derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRb) expression levels were correlated in
human PDA. iTME activates PDGFRb in PDA cells to promote metastasis. We thus hypothesize that activation
of upregulated PPARD in mKRAS+ pancreatic epithelial cells induces and sustains an iTME to promote PDA
progression and metastasis. Aim 1 will determine 1) whether activation of upregulated PPARD in pancreatic
mKRAS+ cells by a GW diet is sufficient to maintain an iTME and promote PDA progression in KPC/Pd mice
and KC/PD-i-fElasCreERT mice (Subaim 1a), in KPC cells with and without PDGFRb KO orthotopically injected
into syngeneic immunocompetent mice (B6.129S) and immunodeficient NSG mice (Subaim 1b), and in human
PanIN–derived organoids (PanIN-DO) transduced with Tet-on inducible PPARD expression lentivirus and
orthotopically transplanted into NSG mice with (HuCD34-NSG) and without (NSG) humanized immune systems
(Subaim 1c); and 2) the chemokines and cytokines, as well as their cell origins, that PPARD employs to maintain
pancreatic iTME using CITE-seq (Subaim 1d). Aim 2 will determine the effects of pancreatic PPARD KO on the
pancreatic iTME and PDA progression in KC/PdKO-fElasCreERT mice fed a HFD and in syngeneic and NSG mice
orthotopically injected with KPC-PdKO cells and fed a GW diet (Subaim 2a), as well as in HuCD34-NSG and
NSG mice transplanted with human PDA-derived organoids without and with PPARD KO and fed a GW diet
(Subaim 2b). This project will provide important insights into PPARD activation as a target for PDA prevention."
10823500,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), the major causative agent of urinary tract infections, can colonize the
bladder (cystitis) and ascend the ureter leading to infection within the kidney (pyelonephritis). Though less
frequent than cystitis, pyelonephritis carries increased health risks, including hypertension, renal abscess
formation, and renal scarring. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of UPEC pathogenesis during pyelonephritis have
remained elusive due to lack of an optimal preclinical infection model. Published work from our group has
established that males exhibit an elevated susceptibility to chronic pyelonephritis and renal abscess formation.
This inherent sex bias in UTI outcomes is androgen dependent, leading us to create new published models of
ascending UTI in androgen-exposed female mice that enable investigation of UPEC virulence strategies within
the kidney.
The UPEC secreted toxin alpha-hemolysin (HlyA) elicits cell lysis and ATP release from various mammalian cell
types in vitro, but was previously shown to be dispensable during UPEC cystitis. Preliminary studies using our
updated mouse model of ascending UTI demonstrated that HlyA is required for optimal UPEC colonization and
associated with severe pathology and renal abscess formation in androgen-exposed hosts. This initial work is
congruent with epidemiologic data showing that ~80% of clinical UPEC isolated from patients with pyelonephritis
are HlyA positive, versus only 40% of cystitis isolates. Purinoreceptors (P2X) are host cell membrane channels
that open upon sensing extracellular ATP and facilitate non-selective passage of small cations. Interestingly, the
P2X4 isotype expressed ubiquitously throughout the renal tubular epithelium, is allosterically activated by direct
interactions with testosterone; modulation of P2X4 function by testosterone increases receptor affinity for ATP,
driving increased ion permeability and subsequent pore conductance. We have found that P2X receptors amplify
HlyA cytotoxicity in vitro. Specifically, exogenous testosterone significantly enhances HlyA-mediated lysis of
renal epithelial cells, and this effect is abolished in the presence of a non-selective P2X inhibitor. Leveraging
updated models of ascending UTI, small-molecule P2X inhibitors, and our in vitro model of renal collecting duct
infection, we will test the central hypothesis that UPEC alpha-hemolysin drives renal pathology during
pyelonephritis, and its activity is augmented by testosterone via enhancement of P2X channel function.
Completion of this work will delineate the contribution of HlyA to UPEC pathogenesis within the kidney, determine
the mechanism which facilitates the sex-biased pathogenic effect of HlyA, and define the contribution of
pharmacologically targetable host P2X4 channels to HlyA toxicity during pyelonephritis."
10823855,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults, causes significant
cognitive impairment, but current therapeutic approaches targeting core AD pathology have not provided
clinically meaningful improvements in cognition. There is strong evidence suggesting parallel or ‘concomitant’
pathologies, such as vascular dysfunction, contribute to cognitive decline. Approximately 80% of AD patients at
autopsy have evidence of co-occurring vascular pathology, and detectable vascular dysfunction predates
detectable changes in traditional AD biomarkers. Associations between vascular risk and cognitive decline
appear most pronounced in individuals with early or mid-life exposure to vascular risk factors prior to onset of
overt cognitive impairment, suggesting that vascular risk may drive early cognitive decline and contribute to or
exacerbate the effects of core AD pathology. To achieve clinically meaningful improvement in cognition, there
is a dire need to develop multi-faceted approaches to prevention and treatment of cognitive decline to target
concomitant risk pathways, such as vascular risk, alongside efforts targeting core AD pathology. Identifying
novel plasma biomarkers predictive of adverse cognitive aging would greatly aid in these efforts by identifying
novel therapeutic targets, but few plasma proteomic studies of AD to date have focused on early clinical
changes, examined disease progression, or replicated results. This F30 proposal aims to fill those gaps by (a)
focusing on participants with normal cognition and mild cognitive impairment, a prodromal form of AD, (b)
examining longitudinal cognitive outcomes, and (c) replicating all results in a separate cohort. Leveraging these
novel strengths, the applicant will take a two-pronged approach to (1) perform hypothesis-driven candidate
protein analyses, based on prior literature and preliminary data, to characterize associations between
ADAMTS13 and cognition, and (2) perform hypothesis-generating discovery analyses to identify novel
biomarkers for adverse cognitive aging. Pursuing two distinct but complementary approaches offers a unique
training opportunity to develop skills and methodologic approaches for working with ‘omics data and will
directly contribute to efforts to identify novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for adverse cognitive aging.
The proposed research will leverage the rich resources of the Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimer’s Center. The
research will be guided by an interdisciplinary mentorship team, including experts in neuropsychology,
neuroscience, plasma proteomics, cardiovascular medicine, and AD. The parallel training plan will facilitate the
candidate’s acquisition of the necessary knowledge and skills to propel her into a successful career as an
independent physician-scientist bridging clinical cardiovascular medicine and cognitive aging research.
Findings from this F30 proposal will provide valuable insight into the role of ADAMTS13 in cognitive decline
and aid in the identification of novel plasma biomarkers predictive of early cognitive decline."
10823934,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Rotavirus (RV) is the leading cause of viral gastroenteritis in children under the age of 5 globally. Despite the
introduction of several WHO-approved vaccines, RV infections still cause 114 million diarrhea episodes, 24
million outpatient visits, and approximately 215,000 deaths annually, and therefore necessitates further study.
Aside from the typical gastroenteritis, around 75% of infected children have viremia and 90% have antigenemia,
and RV detection in the sera is often associated with high fever. Furthermore, various reports indicate the
presence of RV RNA or antigen in extraintestinal tissues, including the hepatobiliary system and pancreas, which
have been linked to clinical manifestations such as biliary atresia and type 1 diabetes mellitus. The molecular
mechanisms by which RV disseminates to systemic organs from the small intestine are not clear.
Studies with reovirus, a closely related non-pathogenic human enteric virus, show that the virus can bypass the
intact epithelial barrier to establish intestinal infection and spread systemically in mouse models by exploiting the
transcytotic nature of microfold (M) cells. M cells are a subset of specialized intestinal epithelial cells that
sample and transport content from the lumen to antigen-presenting cells at the basolateral side of the epithelium.
Various enteric pathogens exploit M cells to gain access to host systemic sites. RV virions have been visualized
in vivo within porcine M cells and human RV was recently shown by our lab to be transcytosed in vitro by human
M cells in an ileal enteroid system. However, it is not known whether RV utilizes M cells for intra- and/or extra-
intestinal infection in vivo. Additionally, the endocytic pathways responsible for M cell uptake of pathogens like
RV have not been defined.
The overall hypothesis of this proposed work is that RV is transcytosed by M cells in a caveolin-
dependent manner and that this process is key to RV intestinal infection, systemic dissemination, and
infection of extraintestinal organs. In Aim 1, the extraintestinal tissues and cell types targeted by RV will be
determined following oral inoculation. Next, Villin-Cre Tnfrsf11aflox/flox mice that lack intestinal M cells will be
utilized to study the role of M cells in intestinal infection and extraintestinal dissemination. In Aim 2, CRISPR-
Cas9 mediated knockout will be used to dissect the endocytic pathway(s) involved in RV transport by M cells in
human ileal enteroids. Conceptually, this study will define the mechanisms by which RV, a major childhood
enteric pathogen, can disseminate systemically and resolve the longstanding question of how M cells transcytose
substrates, paving the path for rational design of M cell-targeted mucosal vaccines for improved immunogenicity
and antigen delivery."
10827444,"Maintaining protein homeostasis, also known as proteostasis, is fundamentally important for all processes in
biology. It is therefore not surprising, that cells contain an entire fleet of chaperones and proteases, which
are tasked to correctly fold and target nascent proteins, prevent unsolicited protein misfolding and protect
proteins against irreversible aggregation. Unfortunately, however, disturbances in the activity or composition
of the proteostasis network do occur, and can be devastating, particularly in their relationship to amyloid-
related protein folding diseases, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. My lab focuses on two
different mechanisms that are involved in maintaining protein homeostasis. My first major project centers on
the functional activity of polyphosphate, a highly conserved polymer composed of long chains of phospho-
anhydride bonded phosphates. Previous work from our lab demonstrated that polyP shares many features
with protein chaperones, including its ability to prevent stress-specific protein aggregation, and to protect
neuronal cells against amyloid toxicity by modulating disease-associated amyloid fibril formation. Most
recently, we added a new function to polyP’s stress-protective repertoire by demonstrating that it undergoes
liquid-liquid phase transitions with nucleoid-associated proteins, and in doing so, contributes to the silencing
of genetic mobile elements in bacteria. We will now use a multipronged cell biological, biochemical and cryo-
EM-based structural approach to i) understand the parameters that drives polyP to interact with proteins in
these multiple different capacities, ii) test the exciting hypothesis, based on two recently solved cryoEM
structures of patient-derived fibrils, that polyP is a physiologically relevant modulator of amyloidogenic
processes, and iii) investigate polyP’s newly identified role as a critical component of bacterial
heterochromatin. The second major research arm in my lab is centered on the hypothesis that histone-based
epigenetic modifications constitute an important but vastly understudied mechanism that acts in regulating
protein homeostasis. We posit that these modifications can affect proteostasis in the short term, long-term
and potentially even trans-generationally. We will focus on the inheritable histone modification H3K4me3,
whose global reduction has been shown by us and others to increase stress gene expression, improve stress
resistance and protect organisms against amyloid-related toxicity. Our major goals are to explore the
mechanism of how global changes in H3K4me3 levels can exert these consequential effects on proteostasis
in general and amyloidogenic processes in particular. Our studies have the potential of adding entirely new
layers of mechanisms to the regulation of protein homeostasis, and will aid in achieving the overarching goal
of identifying the major players guarding the proteome and understanding how they work."
10807189,"Energy substrates must be delivered to the brain continuously through its blood supply. Failure of this process
has devastating consequences because brain function depends on the timely delivery of energy substrates to
neurons through blood flow. Accumulating evidence suggests that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a multifactorial
heterogeneous disease driven by multiple pathophysiological contributors, including brain vascular dysfunction.
Consistent with this, decreased cerebral blood flow is an early biomarker of AD. There is an urgent need to
understand brain vascular mechanisms of AD since they may constitute the most therapeutically addressable
biological pathway underlying dementia. Tau protein, causally implicated in AD, stabilizes microtubules. In AD,
tau misfolds, destabilizing the microtubule cytoskeleton, and is then transferred trans-neuronally, promoting tau
aggregation and microtubule destabilization in target cells. We found, for the first time, that pathogenic tau is also
transmitted to brain microvascular endothelial cells, where it destabilizes microtubules, diminishes activity of the
endothelial form of nitric oxide synthase, induces endothelial cell senescence, and causes profound brain
vascular dysfunction in models of tauopathy. The mechanisms by which pathogenic tau induces brain
microvascular endothelial cell (BMEC) dysfunction and senescence, and the role of tau-induced BMEC
dysfunction and senescence in the etiology of AD have not been explored before. Our goal is to define the
mechanisms of pathogenic tau-induced brain vascular dysfunction and their involvement in AD, and determine
whether (a) removal of pathogenic tau or (b) removal of senescent brain microvascular endothelial cells could
be used to delay (or potentially treat) AD. Our hypothesis is that pathogenic tau transmission to BMEC drives
brain vascular dysfunction in AD by impairing BMEC function and by promoting BMEC senescence. We will
test our hypothesis with studies that will (Aim 1) identify tau-induced molecular alterations that result in brain
endothelial cell dysfunction and senescence; and (Aim 2) establish the therapeutic potential of (a) pathogenic tau
or (b) senescent brain microvascular endothelial cell removal in AD, and determine, in human brain, how
microvascular tau and molecular alterations identified in Aim 1 are linked to AD progression. Our work will
address an entirely new aspect of AD pathophysiology, the accumulation of tau in brain microvasculature and its
transmission to brain endothelial cells, that induces endothelial cell dysfunction and senescence, and will define
whether pathogenic tau and the cellular events it triggers can be targeted therapeutically. These studies are
significant, because once we know how pathogenic tau impairs brain vascular function we will be able to
manipulate those mechanisms in AD and other tauopathies. Our studies will pioneer research on a new cellular
target of tau toxicity -brain vascular endothelial cells- and will define the role of tau in brain vascular dysfunction
of AD. With our studies, that will provide detailed knowledge of new cellular targets and mechanisms of action of
tau immunotherapies, progress will be made to bring TOMA or other immunotherapies to Veterans sooner."
10807522,"Skeletal muscle fibrosis is a pathologic consequence of spinal cord injury (SCI) for which no effective treatment
options exist. SCI-induced muscle fibrosis hinders physical rehabilitation efforts by worsening muscle force
production, impairing muscle regeneration, and promoting contractures, which contributes to limb impairment
caused by SCI. The lack of treatments to counter muscle fibrosis after SCI is largely due to a major knowledge
gap in understanding the cellular and molecular pathway(s) underlying its development. Nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide phosphatase [NAD(P)H] oxidase 4 (NOX4) is a reactive oxygen species (ROS) generating
enzyme that is an anti-fibrotic target in several tissues, including heart, kidney, liver, lungs. Recently, Hammers
(Co-I) identified NOX4 as a driver of muscle fibrosis associated with muscular dystrophy and utilized genetic
NOX4 inhibition (NOX4i) and pharmacologic NOX4i (via GKT831) to substantially reduce myofibroblasts in
dystrophic muscle and to effectively reverse muscle fibrosis and improve muscle function. The goal of this
proposal is to investigate the therapeutic potential of NOX4i in SCI-induced muscle fibrosis. We have
established a rat SCI model that exhibits permanent hindlimb impairment and reproduces the skeletal muscle
phenotype of persons with severe SCI on a timescale that facilitates ‘high-throughput’ testing of potential
interventions. As evidence, muscle fibrosis and atrophy develop over many months in persons with SCI, while
our SCI model exhibits peak fibrosis and atrophy rates within 1-2 wks. A causative role of NOX4 in promoting
SCI-induced muscle fibrosis has yet to be explored. Although, compelling preliminary data indicate that 1)
expression of the Nox4 and other genes associated with fibroblast activity, ECM deposition, and collagen
crosslinking are significantly elevated in muscle during the rapid fibrogenic stage in SCI-affected muscle (RNA-
seq data from Co-Is Barton & Yarrow) and 2) NOX4 protein is persistently localized to fibrotic areas in muscle
after SCI. These data support the central premise of this proposal: heightened NOX4 promotes SCI-induced
muscle fibrosis. For this project, rats will undergo Sham surgery vs severe SCI. SCI rats will receive vehicle
vs GKT831, a small molecule NOX1/4 inhibitor, using immediate and delayed treatment strategies to discern
preventative vs restorative efficacy. Studies will: 1a) identify the GKT831 dose that best attenuates NOX4
activity and fibrosis, 1b) assess the degree to which NOX4 activity and muscle fibrosis change after
discontinuing GKT831, and 1c) determine the magnitude of fibrosis reversal and muscle recovery when
GKT831 is delayed until fibrosis is established. Rehabilitation-centric outcomes and mechanistic outcomes will
be assessed to maximize the potential for future translation and to advance the understanding of SCI-induced
muscle fibrosis. This approach is innovative because it targets NOX4, which is upregulated after SCI and
associated with muscle fibrosis, using a safe and orally available drug that alleviates fibrosis in dystrophic
muscle and other organs. This is a high-risk, high-impact proposal because it is unknown whether NOX4
activity underlies SCI-induced muscle fibrosis or if NOX4i is sufficient to reduce fibrosis and improve muscle
function. Regardless, this project will determine the therapeutic impact of NOX4i on SCI-induced muscle
fibrosis and, if successful, will support the advancement of NOX4i to clinical trials for SCI patients, which may
be transformative for both Veterans and non-Veterans with SCI. There are two Specific Aims.
Aim 1: Determine the ability of NOX4 inhibition to prevent and/or reverse muscle fibrosis and promote
muscle recovery in a rat severe SCI model.
Aim 2: Assess the magnitude to which NOX4 inhibition alters downstream cellular and molecular changes
associated with fibrotic infiltration of muscle after SCI."

Healthcare has changed rapidly in the last decade with the widespread use of electronic health records (EHRs)
and the creation of national EHR-based data networks that aim to improve the quality of care. The American
College of Rheumatology’s RISE registry is a federally Qualified Clinical Data Registry that collects EHR data
from the practices of almost 1000 rheumatologists nationally, analyzes these data centrally, and continuously
feeds back performance on quality measures to practices via a web-based dashboard. In this K24 proposal,
the applicant seeks to leverage this infrastructure to improve care for individuals living with lupus, a population
that has historically faced significant health disparities and gaps in quality of care. The proposed research will
validate newly developed lupus quality measures across RISE practices (Aim 1). In addition, using an
implementation science theory framework and qualitative methods, the applicant will create a toolkit to facilitate
meaningful use of lupus patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in clinical practice (Aim 2). These
studies will develop a rigorous scientific framework for measuring and improving the quality of care and
outcomes for individuals with lupus across the United States. The proposed projects will draw on the
candidate’s strong research portfolio, funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Agency
for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the National Institutes of Health, as well as the outstanding
institutional environment at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). For this five-year K24 award
renewal, the applicant seeks to maintain her record of successfully mentoring trainees interested in patient-
oriented clinical research in rheumatology, both at UCSF and at other institutions. The newly proposed studies
as well as the data available from other funded studies provide rich resources for trainees who are interested in
patient-oriented clinical research in rheumatology related to the use of registries, EHR data, PROs, quality
measurement and implementation science."
10809708,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Identification of dietary factors that delay decline in cognitive function has important implications for reducing
the burden of Alzheimer’s dementia (AD) and reducing health care costs as the population ages. Inadequate
intakes of vitamin K and vitamin D are common among the elderly, and there is growing evidence that both
nutrients have biological roles in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related pathologies, and
the risk of Alzheimer’s dementia. We demonstrated in the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) study that
higher postmortem brain levels of vitamin K and vitamin D were associated with better cognitive function prior
to death. Further investigation of neuropathologically-defined outcomes revealed that higher brain vitamin K
concentrations were associated with lower global AD pathology, specifically fewer neurofibrillary tangles, and
with lesser Lewy bodies (sine qua non of Parkinson’s disease and Lewy Body Dementia). There is now an
urgent need for additional research to clarify the biologic mechanism(s) underlying these cognitive protective
effects. Based on our collective prior research and exciting new research findings generated during the current
project period, we propose an overall goal to elucidate associations between Vitamin K and Vitamin D with
brain structure (neuropathology and neuroimaging outcomes) and brain function (cognitive and motor) in
older persons from two well-characterized community-based studies, MAP and the Rush Minority Aging
Research Study (MARS). Guided by strong preliminary data, this objective will be accomplished by pursuing
two aims: Specific Aim 1: Determine associations of Vitamin K and Vitamin D with MRI-derived indices of
white and gray matter tissue integrity and measures of brain neuropathology in: (a) postmortem brain samples;
and (b) antemortem blood samples; and Specific Aim 2: Determine the associations of brain vitamin K and
vitamin D with motor function and parkinsonian signs. The proposed approach is innovative because this highly
productive and multidisciplinary team will: (1) expand our brain structure outcomes to include neuroimaging
that leverage novel deep-learning approaches, in addition to neuropathologic outcomes, to determine if these
two vitamins are involved in changes in brain tissue integrity that occur in AD and related pathologies; (2)
expand brain function outcomes to include existing outcomes of motor function and parkinsonian signs, in
addition to cognitive outcomes, for novel insight into common mechanisms underlying age-related cognitive
and physical function declines; and (3) add African-American decedents with autopsies from MARS to enhance
generalizability of the findings. The proposed research is significant because intakes of these two nutrients,
which are generally below the recommended amounts in older persons, are modifiable, low-cost, and safe
when consumed in higher amounts. Successful completion of the proposed study will provide the foundation
for future studies on the impact of modifying vitamin K and/or vitamin D on AD risk."
10809709,"Project Summary/Abstract
Advanced age is the leading risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our program is based on a central tenet of
geroscience that select pathways and mechanisms are shared between advanced age and chronic disease,
and knowledge of one can inform the other. The mTORC1-S6K1 kinase axis is an obesity-activated pathway
that restricts longevity, and targeting this pathway extends lifespan in animal models. This pathway has been
implicated in AD pathogenesis, and pre-clinical intervention studies are promising. However, pharmacological
inhibition causes harmful side-effects, deterring therapeutic application. We have discovered a Cdk5-driven
bifurcation of the mTORC1-S6K1 pathway that contributes to aging and adiposity. We identified a novel, triply-
phosphorylated form of S6K1 (we term S6K1*) phosphorylated at two sites in the C-terminus, as well as at
Thr389, the classical mTORC1 activation site. Multi-site phosphorylated S6K1 directs phosphorylation of novel
targets, including the dual function tRNA synthetase, Glu-Pro tRNA synthetase (EPRS), coenzyme A synthase
(CoASY), and lipocalin-2 (Lcn2). Importantly, mice bearing a phospho-deficient mutation of EPRS at the critical
Ser999 residue are lean and exhibit ~120-day lifespan extension. Ser999 EPRS phosphorylation is required for
elevated adipocyte expression of key longevity-related adipokines, including monocyte chemoattractant protein-
1 (MCP1) and plasminogen-activator-1 (PAI-1). MCP1 is a pro-inflammatory protein predominant in the
senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP); PAI-1 is a marker and mediator of cell senescence and
aging, and a null mutation in SERPINE1, the gene encoding PAI-1, protects against biological aging.
Importantly, these novel, age-related targets of S6K1* also are implicated in AD progression. For example,
serum MCP1 level is associated with cognitive decline in mouse AD models and AD patients, and PAI-1
knockout, or pharmacologic inhibition, reduces AD in mice. We hypothesize that the extended mTORC1-S6K1
pathway and its effectors contribute to AD onset and progression, and that genetic inhibition of the pathway will
retard AD onset and reduce its severity with minimal adverse side effects. Also, mice fed a high-fat diet will
show that obesity influences aging and AD progression by a common pathway. We will test these hypotheses in
two Specific Aims. In the first Aim, we will elucidate the role of the S6K1* pathway in AD progression. AD-
susceptible mice will be bred with two genetic mouse models of S6K1* pathway inhibition developed in our
laboratory, namely, EPRS phospho-deficient knock-in mice bearing a Ser999-to-Ala mutation, and our newly
developed S6K1 Ser429-to-Ala mouse model, that lacks the extended S6K1* substrate selection, but exhibits
unaltered canonical S6K1 kinase activity. We will determine effects of S6K1* pathway inhibition on AD
pathology and adverse cognitive side-effects. In the second Aim we will determine the influence of obesity on
S6K1* pathway-mediated AD progression. Our program will establish new mechanisms and molecular targets
for intervention in the aging process and AD."

This PRIDE renewal application from Washington University proposes to build upon our current SIPID/PRIDE
CVD-CGE program which has been successful with continuous funding for the past 16 years. The overarching
goal of our program is to enhance the diversity of the biomedical research workforce by providing creative and
highly-relevant training activities in focus areas related to cardiovascular disease (CVD). We will accomplish this
goal by providing mentoring and research training to junior faculty who come from backgrounds traditionally
underrepresented (URM) in the biomedical research workforce. Our program (13 cohorts, 76 mentees over
16 years) has been highly successful: at the 10-year follow-up, our mentees had: a) received 171 grants (2.3
grants/mentee); published 1,573 manuscripts (21 publications/mentee); and c) received academic promotions
with 48% having achieved rank of Associate Professor/Full Professor. Through the proposed activities listed
below, we plan to recruit 8 mentees each of the first 4 years, to be mentored and trained to develop independent
research careers in areas relevant to the mission of NHLBI with primary focus on CVD. We are adding two new
focus areas based on feedback from current and former trainees, faculty and mentors. Highlights of this renewal
application include: 1) Continue the two current cornerstone focus areas: “CVD epidemiology and
comorbidities”, adding “Global Health” under this focus area, and “Genetic Epidemiology”; 2) Add two new
focus areas: “Implementation Science” and “Data Science/Bioinformatics”, both of which are of strategic
importance to NHLBI and NIH; 3) Enhance our comprehensive mentoring and writing program, with a proven
track record for the past 16 years, to provide rigor and depth to scientific writing; 4) Form a new “External
Mentoring Pool & Recruiting Faculty Committee” composed entirely of our SIPID/PRIDE Alumni (former
mentees) that brings additional depth and mentoring capacity “by URMs for URMs”. For this renewal, we will
continue to focus on the development of competitive “Small Research Project (SRP)” grant applications during
SI-1, while SI-2 will focus on new NIH proposals. Based on mentee feedback, SI-1 and SI-2 has been revamped
into an 8-week program that includes “in person”, “hybrid” and “virtual” segments. This new format allows for
more time at home, yet maintains the academic rigor of previous SIs. A 3-day in-person overlap between new
and returning cohorts will facilitate networking and peer-mentoring. The year-long mentoring program includes
monthly mentoring meetings, a 3-day mid-year meeting, and a 4-day annual meeting in Washington, DC. Finally,
we will follow mentees for two years with bi-annual updates of their individual development plans, while also
focusing on grants and manuscripts writing and academic advancement, with follow up evaluations for up to 10
years. Primary program goals will continue to be focused on mentee success securing independent grant
support, scientific publications and academic promotions."

Title: A comprehensive approach to understanding the genetic causes of urinary stone disease:
combining monogenic and polygenic analyses
One in eight Americans is affected by Urinary Stone Diseases (USDs), with 52% of them experiencing
recurrence within 10 years. Despite their high prevalence, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of
stone formation remains incomplete. USDs are thought to result from a combination of genetics and
environmental factors. Genetic studies have identified 51 monogenic causes, accounting for 11-20% of
pathogenesis. The heritability of USDs is estimated to be 45-50%.
We hypothesize that there are additional novel monogenic and polygenic causes, as well as gene-gene
(GxG) interactions, contributing to the pathogenesis of USDs. With this in mind, we plan to systematically
investigate both monogenic and polygenic genes to identify novel variants associated with USDs. To
accomplish this, we will perform whole genome sequencing and whole exome sequencing analyses on
patients recruited from Harvard Medical School and NIH's ""All of Us"" project. We will also conduct GxG
analysis to analyze the relationship between the risk loci and monogenic genes and develop a polygenic risk
score (PRS) for USDs. Furthermore, we will integrate the burden analysis from monogenic genes into PRS to
develop a mono-polygenic risk score (MPRS) for clinical and research use. Our goal is to employ this
comprehensive approach to gain a deeper understanding of USDs, facilitating future precision pharmaceutical
or environmental interventions.
This K08 grant proposal also outlines a five-year plan for the development of Dr. Chen-Han Wilfred Wu, MD,

biostatistics, and integrating physiology and functional studies with genetics. Through a structured mentorship
plan, multiple advisory committees, coursework, and conferences, Dr. Wu will gain the necessary skills to
advance his career as a physician-scientist. Under the guidance of Dr. Friedhelm Hildebrandt, MD, an
esteemed expert in monogenic studies, and Dr. Fredrick Schumacher, PhD, MPH, a respected statistical

10800395,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cellular response and adaptation to external stress is a fundamental aspect of normal tissue homeostasis. In
cancer, these mechanisms of cellular adaptation become detrimental as they allow cancer cells to survive
through therapy, thus contributing to therapy resistance. The emergence of therapy resistance in cancer is an
example of a phenomenon shaped by both selection and adaptation: While most cells die upon treatment
(selection), a rare subpopulation survives, and a smaller subset even adapts to proliferate in drug medium. Thus,
when studying resistance in cancer, a sample of cells at any time during treatment contains a mixture of cells
with different fates: growth, senescence and death. Our preliminary data has revealed a complex and fascinating
interplay between cellular mechanisms for survival and those for adaptation, with some mechanisms shared
between stressors and others unique to specific stressors. Due to the pervasive role of cellular stress-response
mechanisms in tissue homeostasis and disease, an understanding of how (and which) cells survive and adapt
under different stresses is fundamental both for the understanding of basic tissue biology as well as the
development of disease treatments.
 Currently, there is a lack of methods for single-cell fate tracking in these complex systems where cell fate
is driven by survival and adaptation. One promising experimental approach is lineage barcoding, which uses
unique DNA sequences to label and track individual cells over time. However, there is yet a lack of both
experimental and computational frameworks that integrate lineage tracing with the latest multimodal single cell
and spatial sequencing technologies. Further, the pervasive adoption of single-cell sequencing methods in the
study of human disease underscores the importance of computational approaches for trajectory reconstruction
and cell fate prediction that is applicable to a clinical setting, without the need for genetic barcoding. In this
project, we develop new genetic experimental systems for integration of lineage barcoding with spatial barcoding
and with single-cell multiome RNA and ATAC sequencing; in parallel, we develop a general computational
framework for the prediction of cell fates in the absence of genetic lineage tracing. The new experimental systems
serve as new protocols for the scientific community as well as a powerful validation framework for the
computational methods development. The new computational methods for lineage reconstruction and fate
prediction using multiomic RNA and ATAC sequencing data will be released as open-source software,
addressing critical limitations in current methods. These methods will be applied to the study of cancer cells
treated with a panel of different drugs and stresses. This human biological system is rich with lineage dynamics
and multiple cellular fates as each cancer cell has the possibility of growth, senescence, or cell death. Thus, our
work will reveal fundamental biology about the complex relationship between cancer cell heterogeneity and the
cellular fate of drug resistance."

The aim of this proposal is to discover the cellular and molecular pathways regulated by IL-13 that promote B
cell production of high affinity IgE to allergens. Despite the importance of IgE in allergic responses, the signals
that instruct B cells to produce high affinity, sialylated and long-lived IgE are not well understood. Recently we
discovered in mice and humans a rare subset of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, known as Tfh13 cells, that produce
IL-13 and are required for high affinity IgE production. Ablation of of IL-13 specifically from Tfh13 cells causes a
loss of high affinity IgE and prevents anaphylaxis. Additionally, we have demonstrated that the receptor for IL-
13, IL-13 receptor alpha 1 (IL-13Rα1), is highly expressed on IgG1 GC B cells, IgE GC B cells, and IgE plasma
cells as compared to naïve B cells. These findings suggest that Tfh13-derived IL-13 acts directly on B cells to
promote high affinity IgE responses. However, where in the lymph node Tfh13 cells interact with B cells and how
Tfh13-produced IL-13 promotes high affinity IgE production are unknown. Our hypothesis is that IL-13 acts
on IgE+ B cells to promote their survival. In Aim 1, we will identify the stage of mouse and human IgE+ B cell
differentiation and/or functions that are regulated by IL-13. We will use specialized in vitro culture systems to
generate both mouse and human germinal center-like B cells to test whether IL-13 promotes IgE switching, IgE+
plasma cell differentiation, or IgE+ plasma cell survival. We will also use mass spectrometry to investigate
whether Tfh13 cells and/or IL-13 play a role in the regulation of IgE glycosylation in vitro and in vivo. Additionally,
we will determine whether the expression of IL13Rα1 differs on various B cell subsets in allergic versus healthy
donors and will test how this impacts their response to IL-13. In Aim 2, we will define the role of IL-13Rα1 on
mouse IgE+ B cells in vivo. To achieve this, we will use high-resolution immunofluorescence imaging and spatial
transcriptomics/proteomics to characterize the sub-anatomic regions in the lymph node where IL-13-expressing
Tfh13 cells and B cells interact. Additionally, using a novel conditional Il13ra1 knockout mouse we generated we
will determine which stages of the IgE+ B cell response are disrupted by the loss of IL-13 stimulation in vivo.
Lastly, we will investigate whether B cell intrinsic IL-13Rα1 is necessary for the production of sialylated and high
affinity IgE to allergens and downstream anaphylaxis in vivo. In Aim 3, we will identify the IL13Rα1-specific
signaling pathways that promote IgE production by mouse and human B cells. To accomplish this, we will use a
combination of phospho flow, ChIP-Seq, and RNA-Seq to characterize STAT6-dependent and -independent
signaling pathways in human and mouse B cells downstream of IL-4 versus IL-13 stimulation. Subsequently, we
will use knockout cells and inhibitors to alter the balance of type I and type II receptor signaling downstream of
IL-4 and IL-13. Impact: If successful, this work will define the immunologic rules that govern IgE production by
high affinity B cells and will identify targetable genetic and environmental factors that dictate pathologic IgE
antibody responses in those with allergy."
10800570,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The global burden of kidney disease is substantial and increasing, with a recent estimated global prevalence of
over 700 million cases, with over 37 million in the United States. Mitochondrial dysfunction leading to metabolic
dysregulation manifested by suppressed fatty acid oxidation is a key component in the development of kidney
disease. Ketone metabolism is a central component of metabolic homeostasis. Ketogenesis occurs when fatty
acids are oxidized and converted into ketones. While the liver is the main ketogenic organ, mitochondrial
Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 (HMGCS2), the rate limiting enzyme for ketogenesis, is induced in the
proximal tubule of the kidney in response to fasting. Using liver- and kidney-specific Hmgcs2 deletion mouse
models, we found that renal HMGCS2 does not contribute to circulating ketones during fasting and is thus likely
acting locally. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that proximal tubular HMGCS2 has two
independent intra-renal functions. First, we hypothesize that there is regional ketone metabolic cooperativism in
the kidney whereby ketones are produced by the proximal tubule and are utilized by the distal convoluted tubule.
This is based on our finding that the spatial expression of HMGCS2 in the proximal tubule follows a pattern in
which HMGCS2-expressing proximal tubular cells are in close proximity to distal convoluted tubular cells that
highly express the ketolytic enzyme 3-Oxoacid CoA-Transferase 1. Second, we hypothesize that there is a cell
autonomous effect of proximal tubular HMGCS2. Using a mouse model capable of isolating proximal tubular-
specific mitochondria with or without Hmgcs2 deletion, we found that HMGCS2 deficient mitochondria have a
mitochondrial respiratory defect. Next, we discovered that after renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), kidney
HMGCS2 is suppressed in both the early injury and late fibrotic phases. This is consistent with human CKD
kidney biopsies which also exhibit suppressed HMGCS2 levels. Importantly, we found that mice lacking renal
Hmgcs2 are more susceptible to renal IRI, developing more acute tubular damage and late fibrosis, relative to
controls. Combining a conditional deletion strategy and capitalizing on our model capable of isolating kidney cell-
specific mitochondria, we aim to understand the intra-renal ketone metabolic network in kidney health and
disease. In this proposal, we will test the central hypothesis that proximal tubular HMGCS2 acts locally to 1)
engage in de novo ketogenesis to fuel neighboring distal convoluted tubular cells, and to 2) support proximal
tubular mitochondrial respiration and function. In Aim 1, we will define proximal tubular and distal convoluted
tubular ketone metabolism and determine whether the distal convoluted tubule preferentially utilizes proximal
tubule-derived ketones for energy. In Aim 2, we dissect the intracellular role of proximal tubular HMGCS2 in
supporting mitochondrial function in fasting and ischemic kidney injury."

When faced with a visual scene, the brain encodes both image detail and the scene’s overall intensity,
measured as irradiance. Encoding irradiance is critical for circadian regulation, pupil constriction, and image
vision, among other important functions. A canonical feature of irradiance encoding is the blurring of image
detail in favor of extensive spatial integration of light. The cells in the retina that transmit irradiance information
to the brain are the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). My goal is to understand how
the mechanisms of phototransduction in the ipRGCs support this spatial integration. Melanopsin, the light-
sensitive protein in ipRGCs, is distributed throughout the dendrites, soma, and axon. IpRGCs send irradiance
information to the brain using spikes and phototransduction within the axon is likely to shape spike output.
Preliminary experiments indicate that ipRGC axons are indeed photosensitive. In mice, melanopsin
immunostaining labels axons, including at the optic disk. In electrophysiological recordings of mouse ipRGCs,
illumination of the axon evokes spiking responses, and the cells are more sensitive to large stimuli that
illuminate their axons in addition to their somas and dendrites. I hypothesize that phototransduction in the axon
enables the spatial integration of light over an unexpectedly large area. The lab has established protocols for
electrophysiological recordings from the soma and axon of ipRGCs, and for imaging visually-evoked Ca2+
dynamics in the population of ipRGC axon terminals. I propose an investigation into mechanisms of axonal
photosensitivity (Aim 1) and the axonal contribution to spatial integration at the level of the cell population (Aim
2). To complement my investigations in the mouse, I will also measure the properties of ipRGCs in a species
that has larger eyes and thus longer axons. My proposed experiments will provide an understanding of how
signal transduction operates in distinct cellular compartments of a sensory neuron to support spatial
integration."
10804674,"PROJECT SUMMARY
V-ATPases are versatile, highly conserved, multi-subunit proton pumps responsible for organelle acidification
in virtually all eukaryotic cells. Complete loss of V-ATPase activity is lethal in all eukaryotes except fungi, but
mutations in subunit isoforms are linked to distal renal tubule acidosis, infertility, deafness, and osteopetrosis.
V-ATPase activity is subverted in cancer to support additional demands on cellular pH homeostasis and
promote metastasis by creating an acidic extracellular environment. Endosomal acidification by V-ATPases
also promotes entry of many viruses. There is a crucial need to understand the roles and regulation of V-
ATPase subunit isoforms and enzyme subpopulations in order to target of V-ATPases in specific locations
therapeutically. V-ATPases are regulated by reversible disassembly of the peripheral V1 subcomplex from the
integral membrane Vo subcomplex, and RAVE/Rabconnectin-3 complexes play a critical role in this process.
We will investigate the structure, mechanism, and subunit composition of the yeast RAVE and mammalian
Rabconnectin-3 complexes, which appear to target specific V-ATPase subunit isoforms as part of their activity.
Importantly, mutations in Rabconnectin-3 complexes have been associated with epilepsy and
neurodegeneration but the underlying disease mechanism is unclear. We previously demonstrated in yeast
that organelle-enriched phosphoinositide phospholipids bind differentially to the two a-subunit isoforms of the
Vo subcomplex, providing organelle-specific inputs into V-ATPase localization and activity. Similar lipid
interactions are observed with mammalian a-subunit isoforms in vitro, and we will extend these studies to
characterizing the effects of the interactions in cultured mammalian cells. Finally, although V-ATPases must
function in concert with other cellular mechanisms of pH homeostasis, the underlying mechanisms of this
coordination are not understood. We will address this question in yeast, where we have discovered that acute
or chronic loss of V-ATPase activity triggers endocytosis of a portion of the major H+ export pump, Pma1, from
the plasma membrane. We will determine the mechanism of this vacuole to plasma membrane pH crosstalk.
Reduced vacuole/lysosome acidification is an early step in aging in both yeast and mammalian cells. We will
assess whether aging yeast cells display a loss in coordinated pH homeostasis or emerging defects in the V-
ATPase itself and determine whether these processes can be manipulated."
10799842,"Project Summary
After myocardial infarction (MI), fibroblasts differentiate to a hypersecretory phenotype. Attesting to the scale of
their extracellular matrix (ECM)-manufacturing capacity, a single fibroblast can produce >500,000 procollagen
chains per hour. Such large demands for collagen production must be met by changes in the metabolic network
to drive carbon for glycine and proline synthesis, which constitute a large proportion of collagen. Previous studies
have shown that this demand is met by de novo amino acid synthesis, which requires metabolic remodeling to
coordinate substrate utilization with biosynthetic pathway activity. Understanding mechanisms that facilitate
metabolic changes to promote fibroblast-mediated ECM deposition could provide actionable targets to improve
cardiac remodeling after injury. Previous studies indicate that metabolism plays critical roles in fibroblast function,
with glycolysis and glutaminolysis playing important roles in fibroblast activation and collagen secretion. We find
that fibrogenic stimuli upregulate enzymes known to participate in a unique metabolic cycle that could uphold
rapid and voluminous collagen synthesis after MI. Fibroblasts isolated from infarcted hearts, as well as naïve
fibroblasts treated with TGF-β, upregulate pyruvate kinase M2 (Pkm2) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase
2 (Pck2), which play essential roles in the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) cycle. In our working model, Pkm acts as
a rheostat in the PEP cycle: catalytically slower Pkm2 promotes a PEPSLOW cycle that functions to augment
biosynthesis, while catalytically faster Pkm1 promotes a futile PEPFAST cycle that diminishes biosynthetic pathway
activity and collagen production. The PEP cycle is completed via Pck2, which utilizes additional carbon from
anaplerosis to form non-glycolytic PEP, which provides additional triose precursors for glycine and collagen
synthesis. Thus, we hypothesize that fibroblast collagen secretion is amplified by an extant PEPSLOW cycle, which
functions to accelerate glycine synthesis and can be targeted to diminish fibrotic burden. Consistent with a role
of the PEP cycle in fibrosis, our data suggest that induction of a PEPFAST cycle via fibroblast-specific
Pkm2Pkm1 splice variant switching improves cardiac remodeling and diminishes collagen deposition after MI.
Our preliminary data also suggest that promoting Pkm1-like activity by pharmacologically activating Pkm2
decreases collagen abundance in isolated fibroblasts. Similarly, deletion of Pck2 influences fibroblast phenotype
and could play a major role in regulating collagen synthesis. Thus, in this project, we will thoroughly examine the
role of the PEP cycle in cardiac fibroblasts and assess the mechanisms by which it influences cardiac fibrosis.
To test our general hypothesis, we will: (1) elucidate the role of Pkm alternative splicing on cardiac fibroblast
metabolism and cardiac fibrosis; and (2) delineate how the PEP cycle influences cardiac fibrosis after MI. Results
of these studies will delineate the mechanisms by which the PEP cycle influences ECM synthesis and modulates
the response of the heart to MI. This project could lead to the development of actionable therapies to diminish
collagen biosynthesis and cardiac fibrosis, for which there are no currently approved therapies."
10809826,"PROJECT SUMMARY
It is commonplace for individuals after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction to shift mechanical de-
mands away from their surgical knee and limb. This manifests as diminished knee moments and vertical ground
reaction forces in the ACL limb during everyday tasks (e.g., walking, running, standing, landing, etc.) and persists
for as long as 2.5 years after surgery. This pattern of underloading is considered maladaptive, as it has been
linked to re-injury and biological markers that are consistent with the development of post-traumatic osteoarthritis
that affects over 50% of knees 10-20 years after surgical reconstruction. A fundamental gap exists in our under-
standing of how to restore normal loading patterns to the surgical limb after ACL reconstruction. Split-belt tread-
mill training, where treadmill belts are de-coupled such that one limb walks faster than the other, has proven
capable of modifying loading during walking in healthy and neurological populations. Our own pilot data in ACL
reconstructed individuals further supports the premise that split-belt treadmill training can profoundly increase
loading in the ACL knee and limb. However, the effects of split-belt treadmill training in ACL reconstructed indi-
viduals have yet to be studied systematically, so its true efficacy in this population remains unknown. Further,
information regarding the most effective de-coupling speed, what limb to train, and whether acute aftereffects
persist once the split-belt training is removed is not available and is critical to designing an appropriate training
program for ACL reconstructed individuals. The absence of this information serves as the driving force and focus
of the proposed clinical studies. Therefore, we propose studies to define the optimal speed of decoupling nec-
essary for each limb to increase ACL knee loading (Aim 1) and to examine the short-term aftereffects (i.e.,
loading after training) of a single bout of split-belt treadmill training of the ACL and non-ACL limbs (Aim 2). As
we look from this proposal to a randomized clinical trial, our Exploratory Aim will test the benefits of a 6-week
split-belt treadmill training intervention. We hypothesize that knee loading in the ACL reconstructed limb will
increase as the speed on the de-coupled/ACL reconstructed limb belt increases. Further, we hypothesize that
split-belt mediated aftereffects will be significantly higher in a split-belt training condition compared to a tied-belt,
speed-matched control condition. This study is innovative because it systematically evaluates a novel, promising
intervention for ACL reconstructed individuals to modify knee and limb loading, which is a maladaptive biome-
chanical strategy that has no other interventions available capable of minimizing its effects. The proposed re-
search is significant because, if successful, it will identify a treatment approach that may successfully counteract
the knee and limb underloading that plagues ACL reconstructed individuals for years after injury and contributes
to the onset of post-traumatic osteoarthritis."
10819500,"Abstract/Summary (Pilot Program)
The main goal of the proposed Center's Pilot Program is to foster the career development of junior
investigators carrying out research in the field of cystic fibrosis (CF). A secondary goal is to attract more senior
investigators from outside the field into areas of CF research. One mechanism that has been key to achieving
these goals is our Pilot Program, which provides seed money for research that has not yet reached the stage
of maturity necessary to garner funding through traditional NIH mechanisms. During the 21 years that the P30
Pilot Program has been running, it has funded 66 pilots in areas of CF research and other genetic diseases.
Numerous junior investigators funded through this program have gone onto develop independent and well
funded research programs. Prior to 2014, P30 Pilots included other genetic diseases and after that they were
required to be focused on CF (including lung). In keeping with the overall shift of the Center's focus for this
funding cycle, revisions to the Pilot Program include a requirement for the research to be focused on CF
research related to the NIDDK mission (i.e., excluding lung). The Pilot Program is run through the Center's
Administrative Core, with oversight from three committees: the Pilot and Feasibility Committee, the Executive
Committee, and the External Advisory Committee. These groups take into account two external reviews per
application in making decisions about funding. Progress of the pilot projects is monitored through numerous
forums that are supported by the Center's Enrichment Program, and awardees are provided with extensive,
constructive feedback that greatly facilitates the evolution of their research. In this section, we will summarize
the progress made in past pilot projects and the success that many of the pilot holders have had to date.
Notably, the 7 pilot grants that were funded during the last 5-year funding period resulted in 25 publications."
10820477,"Abstract
The toxic effects of platinum-based compounds (PBCs) commonly used in chemotherapy weigh against their
usefulness as the major option for successfully combating lethal cancers. The decision to opt for survival
leaves people worldwide to suffer with PBC neurotoxicity that reduces quality of life by causing neurological
disorders both during and long after treatment. Pain, strange sensations, fatigue, and difficulty with balance
and walking are common symptoms, collectively known as chemotherapy-induced neuropathy (CIN). During
treatment, both sensory and motor neurons are observed to fire unintentionally, i.e. they exhibit spontaneous
firing (SA), and evidence suggests that SA bears responsibility for the earliest signs of distress, including
uncontrolled muscle contraction, cramping, and unusual body sensations. Prolonged impact of SA is
suggested by observations that the intensity of acute signs and symptoms of toxicity is predictive of the
severity of symptoms that develop after with PBC accumulation and persist for months or years after treatment.
This situation describes the urgent need for prevention or treatment of PBC effects on abnormal neuronal
activity and its underlying causes, but no effective solution has been found. The research project proposed
here is designed to meet this need by examining the effects of human-scaled doses of PBC on motor neurons
in cancer-bearing rats studied in vivo. The proposal prioritizes three specific aims as the most logical and
impactful next steps, all supported and proven feasible by preliminary experiments and findings. Aim 1 will test
whether PBC accumulation in motor neuron cell bodies within the central nervous system (CNS) is necessary
or sufficient to induce SA. Emphasis on the CNS is a new direction in the field that breaks with common, yet
untested consensus that SA originates at unusual, i.e. ectopic sites of firing out in the peripheral nervous
system. This new direction is driven by recent and conclusive findings presented here that SA in motor
neurons is produced within the CNS. A possible cause of SA will be tested using methods to measure and
manipulate PBC accumulation in motoneurons. Aim 2 will take advantage of the exceptional access of spinal
motor neurons for studying, within a living animal, the biophysical mechanisms underlying changes in neuronal
excitability and SA. The results will provide the first ever detail about the effects of PBC on intrinsic excitability
of motor neurons and will guide understanding of effects that are entirely unknown for other neurons in the
CNS. Aim 3 will test the possibility that SA in motor neurons is driven synaptically by SA shown here for
sensory neurons. This systematic examination of SA induced by PBC neurotoxicity will significantly advance
the field by critically assessing three major candidate mechanisms having strong potential for evidence-based
impact on urgently needed development of preventative measures or treatments."

The Data Management and Analysis (DMA) Core will provide comprehensive data science support for the
Program Project Grant (PPG): Precision Cardiovascular Disease Phenotyping and Pathophysiological
Pathways in the CARRS cohort (Precision-CARRS). The overarching goal of the DMA Core is to maintain
high scientific rigor in the management and analysis of large and complex datasets. The DMA Core will be
based at Emory University and the Center for Chronic Disease Control (CCDC) in India. The DMA Core will
include 8 investigators with comprehensive data science expertise and a dedicated team of database engineer,
data managers and biostatisticians from both the US and India. The DMA Core will oversee data
management, data sharing, and the development of common analytic frameworks to promote integration and
synergy across the interconnected aims of the Precision-CARRS Projects. The DMA Core will work closely
with the Administrative and Field Coordination (AFC) Core and the CVD Phenotyping Core to ensure high
quality data capture and documentation, as well as to provide continuous infrastructure and management for
all research data from Precision-CARRS (Aim 1). By leveraging and expanding existing data platforms, we will
establish workflows and protocols for consistent data cleaning, harmonization, monitoring and documentation
for diverse datasets, including longitudinal surveys, subclinical and clinical phtenotypes, blood and urine
biomarker measurements, environmental exposures, and data from high-throughput omics technologies and
digital sensors. The DMA Core will also work closely with all Reseach Projects to provide centralized support
for data analysis using state-of-the-art biostatistics, bioinformatics and maching learning methods (Aim 2).
Specifically, the DMA Core will create synchronized analytic plans for both epidemiologic modeling and
predictive equation development across projects. To provide integrated and timely data science support
throughout the PPG, two DMA Core investigators (one from Emory and one from CCDC) will serve as liaisons
for each Core and Project. Finally, the DMA core will support the development of new and innovative analytic
methods motivated by the scientific goals of Precision-CARRS (Aim 3). The DMA Core is particularly poised to
contribute in the areas of machine learning for predictive health, latent variable models for handling multivariate
and structured data, high-dimensional methods for multi-omics, and integrative analysis of heterogeneous data
types. In summary, the DMA Core will be an integral component for Precision-CARRS by offering essential
data management and analysis support for PPG research aims, while enhancing the reliability, relevance and
reproducility of the PPG’s findings to utlimately sustain the long-term impact and collaborative potential of

10821363,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT: Project 1
 The overarching goal of Project 1 is to study the prevalence, incidence, pathophysiology and predictors of
sub-clinical and clinical vascular and myocardial disease in South Asian individuals with and without “traditional”
cardiovascular disease (CVD). There are well-recognized gaps in understanding contributors to the increased
atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) and heart failure (HF) risk in South Asians, a population at high risk at a younger
age, despite relatively low body mass index, and with a high prevalence of type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia,
hypertension, and hepatic steatosis. Available predictive algorithms for evaluation of risk under-estimate ASCVD
risk in South Asians. The prevalence of HF, including both HF with reduced (HFrEF) and preserved (HFpEF)
ejection fraction is also rising in this population. However, there are few population-based studies with
longitudinal data available in the SA population. In Project 1 of Precision-CARRS, we will leverage and build
upon a unique resource and scientific opportunity, the ongoing Center for cArdiometabolic Risk Reduction in
South Asia (CARRS) cohort, established with NHLBI funding, with 21,864 community-based participants
representative of two cities in India who have been followed for up to 10 years with high retention rates and a
biorepository. We propose to perform an additional 5 years of follow-up with careful phenotyping and accrue an
estimated 167,725 person-years of follow-up by 2025 with an estimated ~1,000 incident ASCVD and ~900 HF
cases. In Aim 1, we will study the prevalence of subclinical vascular disease and incidence of adverse ASCVD
events and their associations with longitudinally acquired ASCVD and metabolic risk factor data. We aim to
develop South Asian-specific predictive algorithms and validate them in independent cohorts. Sub-clinical
disease measures include arterial stiffness, coronary artery calcium score (CAC), carotid intima-media thickness
(CIMT) and carotid plaque. In Aim 2, we will determine the prevalence of subclinical left ventricular (LV)
dysfunction and clinical HF and their relationship with longitudinally measured ASCVD and metabolic risk factors.
Sub-clinical systolic and/or diastolic LV dysfunction will be measured using echocardiography and HF Stages
C/D (HFrEF / HFpEF) determined for clinical events. Our goal is to develop South Asian-specific predictive
algorithms for HF. In Aim 3, we will determine the relationship between advanced lipid measures, advanced
metabolic measures, including hepatic fat measurements and activation of specific pathophysiologic pathways
and the presence of (i) sub-clinical vascular and (ii) myocardial disease, and (iii) incident adverse ASCVD and HF
events. Activation of pathophysiologic pathways will be estimated from circulating protein biomarkers
(inflammation, immune dysregulation, thrombogenesis, myocardial ischemia/stretch). Our overall goal is to
augment the scientific value of the existing cohort by defining the natural history of ASCVD and HF in South
Asians, thus paving the way for developing predictive algorithms in this high-risk population."
10821365,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT: Project 2
Environmental factors (i.e., ambient air pollution) are ubiquitous and potential causative factors in
cardiovascular disease (CVD). Our preliminary studies using data from the NIH-funded GeoHealth Hub and the
NHLBI-funded Center for cArdiometabolic Risk Reduction in South Asia Cohort (CARRS), indicate a strong
temporal association for short- and long-term effects of ambient particulate matter (PM2.5)) exposure and
elevated blood pressure and glycemic measures. Motivated by these findings, in Project 2 of Precision-
CARRS, we will investigate the longitudinal association between PM2.5 and CVD subclinical and clinical CVD
phenotypes (provided by the CVD Phenotyping Core). For atherosclerotic (ASCVD) and heart failure (HF)
pathways. Precision-CARRS, will follow 21,864 socio-demographically diverse South Asians aged ≥20 years,
representative of Delhi and Chennai, two cities with high levels of, and substantial spatio-temporal variability in,
ambient air pollution. The cohort will be followed for up to 15 years, accruing 176,536 person-years and >1000
incident ASCVD (MI, stroke, CVD death) events and nearly 940 HF Stage C/D cases. PM2.5 will be assessed
through a hybrid predictive model combining statistical and machine learning techniques using data from
satellites, land use maps, meteorology, and emissions inventories. Our aims are: To assess the relationship
between PM2.5 and: (Aim 1) Functional subclinical vascular and myocardial disease (arterial stiffness, and left
ventricular dysfunction measured as either systolic and/or diastolic dysfunction using echocardiography); (Aim
2) Structural subclinical disease (artery calcium; carotid intimal media thickness, carotid plaque); (Aim 3)
Clinical CVD events (i) ASCVD: incident nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and CVD Death, (ii) HF: Stage
C/D cases). In Aim 4, we will explore whether the pathophysiologic pathway-specific proteins measured in
Project 1 (i.e., inflammation, immune dysregulation, myocardial ischemia and stress) modify the associations
between PM2.5 and clinical ASCVD and HF. We will also contribute data to Project 3 to further examine the
causal link between PM2.5 and CVD phenotypes using untargeted multi-omics, and Project 4 to separate social
from environment influences in the production of CVD risk. We will contribute to the understanding of the
connection between one of the leading adverse environmental exposures (i.e., air pollution) and CVD, to
improving precision of risk prediction by accounting for environmental factors to advance precision CVD
prevention, and generate data to facilitate global health policy to address air pollution."
10821367,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT: Project 3
To transform conventional imprecise cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessments towards more precise
risk prediction and early-stage detection, Project 3 will conduct an untargeted multi-omic study to investigate
molecular factors associated with subclinical and clinical CVD phenotypes along atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD)
and heart failure (HF) pathways including HF with preserved (HFpEF) and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).
Both genetic and environmental risk factors contribute to the development of CVD. Identified genetic variations
only account for a small proportion of ASCVD and HF risk in the population. Effect of environmental
contributions to CVD, however, remain largely unexplored at the molecular level. Biomolecules, such as
epigenetic and metabolomic markers, can capture complementary molecular effectors in response to
environmental exposures, and alter biological functions at multiple levels. Therefore, studying multiple
molecular layers (e.g., epigenome and metabolome) may help discover novel pathways and mechanisms
through which environmental exposures influence CVD development and provide new targets for prevention
and management of CVD. This is particularly important for populations, such as South Asians, who suffer a
high burden of CVD at young ages and have unique cardiometabolic risk profile (e.g., very high prevalence of
diabetes and dyslipidemia despite relatively low prevalence of obesity), but are underrepresented in current
population studies of epigenomics, metabolomics and genomics. Examining the changes in multi-omic markers
in relation to the natural history of CVD phenotypes within the same individuals provides a controlled and
unbiased evaluation of these relationships. To identify epigenomic and metabolomic factors associated with
subclinical (Aim 1, atherosclerosis and left ventricular systolic/diastolic dysfunction) and clinical CVD (Aim 2,
coronary artery disease, HFpEF, ischemic and non-ischemic HFrEF), we will conduct epigenome-wide and
metabolome-wide association analyses of 3,000 participants informatively selected from the Precision
Cardiovascular Phenotyping and Pathophysiological Pathways in the CARRS cohort (Precision-CARRS),
measured at baseline and the first follow-up visit, and replicate the findings in external cohorts. To determine
the joint impact of genomic, epigenomic and metabolomic profiles on subclinical and clinical CVD and build
prediction models (Aim 3), we will apply advanced multi-omic approaches, machine learning algorithms and
causal inference methods. Lastly, we will assess whether epigenomic and metabolomic profiles are associated
with, and mediate ambient air pollution (from Project 2) in relation to subclinical and clinical CVD (Aim 4).
Through comprehensive multi-omic measurements and integrative analyses, Project 3 will improve the risk
assessment, molecular understanding and precision medicine of CVD in South Asians."
10821370,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Project 4 (Lead: Patel; Early Stage Investigator)
Spouse lifestyle choices and psychosocial characteristics may powerfully influence the other spouse’s
cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk milieu. We have compelling preliminary baseline data from the Center for
cArdiometabolic Risk Reduction in South Asia Cohort (CARRS) that the odds of overweight, hypertension,
diabetes, and depression are twice as high in adults who have a spouse with those same conditions. These
cross-sectional associations of spousal CVD risks raise questions regarding whether development of CVD in
one spouse can assist in more precisely predicting future risk of CVD in the partner. Identifying the
mechanisms of specific spousal influences on CVD development may inform contextually-tailored, family-level
interventions to target modifiable CVD risk factors. In Project 4 of Precision-CARRS, we will investigate spouse
dyads already enrolled in the CARRS cohort to better understand the independent influence of spouses on the
natural history of subclinical and clinical vascular and myocardial disease. CARRS is a large and diverse
community-based cohort of 21,864 South Asian adults aged ≥ 20 years residing in Delhi and Chennai, India. By
design, one randomly selected man and woman per sampled household were recruited at baseline, yielding
5,931 spouse dyads (n= 11,862 adults; 54% of the cohort), followed for up to 10 years (median: 5 years).
Through Precision-CARRS, we will utilize repeated measures of traditional atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) risk
factors collected since baseline, novel phenotyping of subclinical and clinical CVD disease (CVD phenotyping
Core). In addition, Project 4 will collect new, real-time data on sleep characteristics, physical activity levels,
diet, and psychosocial factors over a 7-day observation period using low-burden mHealth technologies
(wearable wristband tracker and smartphone application; n=1,500 spousal dyads). Analyses will account for
individual-level risk factors and also quantify the role of shared environmental risk factors such as built
environment and air pollution (Project 2) in the development of CVD risk. Our aims are to: Aim 1. Evaluate
spousal influences on ASCVD risk factors. Aim 2. Determine the relationship between spousal CVD measures
and subclinical and clinical vascular disease and myocardial disease. Aim 3. Evaluate interpersonal
mechanisms of spousal influences by examining day-to-day associations in health behaviors and psychosocial
measures that are risk factors for CVD in a subsample of 1,500 dyads. Project 4, led by an Early Stage
Investigator, adds to Precision-CARRS by identifying how the development of CVD—from early risk to clinically
manifest disease—is independently influenced by one’s spouse. Expanding CVD risk assessment to include
spouse’s CVD related behaviors and outcomes will highlight pathways for risk reduction and may inform more
precise and early identification of CVD."

the core is to develop and implement clinical procedures and collect biomarkers for the high standard
characterization of elders spanning the spectrum of normal, prodromal, and various stages of affected subjects
into “research-ready” cohorts. The Clinical Core provides subjects, tissue, and data for studies as well as
clinical research expertise related to clinical manifestations of disease, disease course, treatment responses,
and recruitment feasibility to help guide the design and implementation of studies within the Center and broadly
within the MSHS. Within the Center, the Clinical Core provides the essentials for research: the subjects and
their clinical characterization to participate in the Biomarker and Genetics Cores; the clinical characterization of
brain donations and other specimens disseminated to the Neuropathology Core; clinical and educational
expertise to interact with the projects and trainees of the ORE and REC cores. The Core innovates in the
development of assessment tools; application of assessments to new populations; adaptation of new imaging
technologies into the clinical `real world'; and clinical trials of novel, under-studied or repurposed compounds.
The Core has a rich and successful history of outreach to groups underrepresented in dementia research and
provisions to continue this are built into this application. The Core is active in training young investigators and
supporting investigators from other fields who wish to study cognition in their clinical populations."

The overarching aim of the Neuropathology core is to promote research in AD by providing exceptionally well
characterized postmortem human brain tissue and related specimens to ADRC and non-ADRC researchers
within and outside the Mount Sinai neuroscience community and to support the ADRC cores, including the
Clinical, Biomarker, Genetics, Education and Data Management cores. The Core's enduring goal and practice
of providing accurate assessments and well-characterized brain tissues and derivatives to the neuroscience

paradigm-shifting neuropathological concepts, such as AD subtypes, depend on the availability of well-
characterized brains from extensively phenotyped donors for research. Yet, there is an alarming shortage of well
annotated specimens and neuropathologists with expertise to support the research community. The overall aim
of this core is to continue to maintain and operate the Brain Bank in such a way as to meet the dementia research
needs of neuroscience laboratories optimally while providing state-of the art neuropathologic characterization of
all brain specimens referred to the bank by the clinical core. In addition, Core D endeavors to anticipate the
research needs of the future by banking multiple non-CNS specimens to enable: a) the translation of findings in
the CNS to readily accessible biomarkers; and b) studies of systemic and environmental influences on dementia

a large dementia brain biorepository; enable and facilitate state-of-the-art translational research; determine and
record quantitatively the extent and distribution of relevant lesions present within each brain specimen; provide
training opportunities for new core leaders and neuropathology researchers."
10821331,"Experimental and Computational Studies in Genetic Cardiomyopathies
PI: Farid Moussavi-Harami
Abstract
 Cardiomyopathies, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated
cardiomyopathy (DCM), are an ideal venue for implementing precision medicine strategies. This
is due to more routine use of genetic testing and the vast amount of knowledge regarding
underlying biophysical mechanisms of sarcomeric variants, which contribute to both DCM and
HCM. While the mechanisms of how sarcomeric variants cause cardiomyopathies is an active
area of investigation, it is clear that they disrupt the finely tuned force-generation properties of
cardiomyocytes. Many investigators have used a variety of biophysical and biochemical assays
to study mechanism of sarcomeric variants and then scale these studies up to cells, tissues and
animal models. These approaches are informative, but incremental and unable to asses many
variants at once. Success in this area requires robust high-throughput assays with the ability for
analysis of thousands of divergent variants at once. Our proposal will directly overcome limitations
in the field by applying data analytics to biophysical simulations and experimental cardiac
twitches. The fundamental hypothesis is that the principal features of cardiac twitches summarize
the complex intra and inter-filament interactions of sarcomeric variants. Moreover, we can utilize
these features for variant classification, predicting therapeutic response and identification of new
therapeutics targets. Testing these hypotheses requires 1) large datasets of variants, 2) models
that account for variant location and abundance in sarcomeres and 3) development and validation
of data analytic methods. Biophysical simulations of sarcomeric variants can provide such
datasets, but require validation in experimental systems. We will use a spatially explicit
computational model of the sarcomere that can simulate how perturbations in sarcomere
mechanochemistry change myocyte force generation. Simulated twitches will be generated,
validated and used for predicting targeted therapeutics."
10821332,"Alzheimer's Disease and AD-related dementias (ADRDs) (Frontotemporal Dementia, Lewy Body Dementia, etc.) are devastating neurodegenerative disorders whose onset is correlated with age. Due to the increase of human life span in the 20th century, Alzheimer's and ADRDs have become a major medical, societal and economic issue of today. In spite of decades of research and clinical efforts, cures have been elusive, and Alzheimer's has become the 6th cause of death in the USA. New hypotheses, mechanisms and drug targets for Alzheimer's and ADRDs are urgently needed. One promising direction is inflammation: aging and many age-related diseases are thought to be causally linked with a chronic inflammatory state known as inflammaging. Alzheimer's is no exception, and neuroinflammation establishes an environment in the brain that is hostile for the function and survival of neurons. While it is not yet clear if neuroinflammation is a cause of Alzheimer's, it is increasingly believed that alleviating neuroinflammatory processes might slow down Alzheimer's Disease progression. Cell senescence is an irreversible arrest of proliferation due to a variety of stresses. It is characterized by the secretion of proinflammatory molecules, the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The paracrine effect of the SASP on surrounding cells is a key mechanism by which senescent cells promote age-associated diseases. Essentially all brain cells, including astrocytes, microglia and neurons, can become senescent. The frequency of senescent cells increases in Alzheimer's and ADRDs. Removing senescent cells in mouse models of Alzheimer's reduces neuroinflammation, alleviates pathology and improves cognitive function. We discovered a novel mechanism which maintains and propagates cell senescence, and thus inflammation. Retrotransposable elements (RTEs), known as Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements (LINE-1, or L1) are activated in senescent cells and induce a type-I interferon (IFN-I) response, which in turn drives the SASP. The IFN-I response is triggered by innate immune system DNA sensors that detect cytoplasmic L1 cDNAs, whose synthesis can be blocked by nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) drugs. NRTIs were developed to treat HIV, and several well- tolerated drugs potently inhibit the L1 reverse transcriptase (RT). On the basis of this evidence we hypothesize that L1 activation is an important component of Alzheimer's neuroinflammation and that L1 is a relevant drug target for the treatment of Alzheimer's and ADRDs. We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) To investigate the genesis of L1 cDNAs in the cytoplasm of senescent cells. This will define new targets and target engagement assays for NRTI treatment of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's. 2) To apply NRTI therapy to mouse models of Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. Due to their good blood-brain barrier penetration NRTI drugs hold great promise for the treatment of Alzheimer's and ADRDs. Aim 3: To assess the efficacy of available NRTIs to inhibit L1, as well as to develop new drugs against L1-encoded enzymes. In aggregate, this research will shed new light on the mechanisms of neuroinflammation and advance new treatments for Alzheimer's and ADRDs."
10821333,"Project Summary
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is one of the most important medical imaging modalities because of its
ability to detect and characterize lesions throughout the body. However, access to MRI is severely limited by its
expensive hardware, complex siting requirements and typically-qualitative images, which require highly skilled
radiologists to interpret. This project proposes a fundamentally new way to encode MRI that could enable sub-
stantially cheaper and more ﬂexible quantitative MRI scanners.
 Today the overwhelming majority of MRI scans are encoded using two primary methods: B0 gradients
and parallel imaging using an array of receiver coils. B0 gradients take up a signiﬁcant fraction of the bore diam-
eter; are loud and induce peripheral nerve stimulation, compromising patient comfort; they have relatively long
switching times due to the high inductance of the coils; they require bulky cooling systems and customized am-
pliﬁers; they are expensive, representing 25-30% of the cost of a clinical scanner; and they must be carefully
designed and customized to a scanner's B0 magnet. B0 gradient encoding also suffers from spatial errors due to
concomitant terms, which increase with decreasing B0 ﬁeld strength and will limit the performance of emerging
portable and low-cost MRI systems. Parallel imaging enables scan acceleration by differentiating signals across
large spatial distances, but cannot encode complete images on its own. While some have proposed a third class
of encoding methods using radiofrequency transmit (B1+) gradients, none of the methods described to date have
been translated into clinical use because of practical limits on their performance, stringent hardware requirements
and lack of ﬂexibility in image contrast.
 This project will develop and validate a fourth, fundamentally new way to encode MRI based on parallel
transmission using B1+-selective pulses produced by wireless RF coil units with on-coil ampliﬁers that perform
RF transmission and reception, combined with an acquisition and reconstruction process inspired by MR Finger-
printing (MRF). This new method, Selective Encoding through Nutation and Fingerprinting (SENF), completely
eliminates the need for B0 gradients and is compatible with a wide range of magnet designs and ﬂexible ac-
quisition strategies. Unlike previous B1+ imaging methods, SENF places no strict spatial variation requirements
on the RF gradient ﬁelds, which enables ﬂexible system design, and the same coils can be used for spatial en-
coding and signal reception. Furthermore, instead of suffering from errors due to complex spin dynamics during
RF encoding, SENF leverages those dynamics to its advantage to differentiate quantitative tissue parameters.
Successful completion of this project will enable a new generation of cheaper, more accessible, more modular,
and lower-maintenance MRI scanners with quantitative outputs that can be more directly related to disease and
tissue states."
10821335,"Project summary
Our long-term goal is to demonstrate the utility of ultrasound for OA assessment, standardize its acquisition
and scoring, and promote increased uptake of US for use in clinical, research, and trial settings. Knee
osteoarthritis (KOA) is highly prevalent and frequently debilitating. Development of potential treatments has
been hampered by the heterogenous nature of this common chronic condition, which is characterized by a
number of subgroups, or phenotypes, with different underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Imaging,
genetics, biochemical biomarkers, and other features can be used to characterize phenotypes, but variations in
data types can make it difficult to harmonize definitions. While radiography is widely used in KOA imaging, it is
limited in its ability to assess early disease (when interventions are most likely to succeed) and is insensitive to
change. Ultrasound (US) is a widely accessible, time-efficient and cost-effective imaging modality that can
provide detailed and reliable information about all joint tissues (e.g., cartilage, meniscus, synovium, bone), and
could therefore inform phenotypes in KOA (e.g., by presence of synovitis, effusion, cartilage damage, calcium
crystal deposition, and popliteal cysts). Use of US is currently limited by the lack of systematically performed
studies in well-characterized non-clinical populations. To address this gap and further the use of this
advantageous imaging modality for KOA, we will obtain standardized US and radiography in the population-
based Johnston County Health Study (JoCoHS), the new enrollment phase of the 25+ year Johnston County
OA Project which includes white, African American, and Hispanic men and women aged 35-70, to achieve
three aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the population prevalence (n~3000) of knee US features including
cartilage and meniscal damage, synovitis/effusion, calcium crystal deposition, popliteal cysts and osteophytes
overall and in key subgroups by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and symptom status. Aim 2 will allow quantification of
the associations between these US features and radiographic findings and symptom scores overall and in key
subgroups (e.g., those with and without radiographic KOA, by sex, by race/ethnicity). For Aim 3, we will apply
novel machine learning methodologies (e.g., Direction-projection-permutation [DiProPerm] hypothesis testing,
Joint and Individual Variation [JIVE], and Distance-Weighted Discrimination [DWD]) to a) develop an overall
US score for symptomatic KOA and b) identify the contribution of US variables to phenotypes relevant to KOA
based on general health, physical activity, and functional assessments. This study is a crucial step to establish
the foundation for US as an assessment tool for clinical use, research, and clinical trials in KOA, providing
unique population-based cross-sectional data regarding the utility of US and forming the basis for future
longitudinal work evaluating its value and performance characteristics related to incident and progressive KOA."
10823279,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In the US, pregnant patients use 4 medications on average, and 70% use at least one. Yet, most drugs lack
conclusive evidence about safety during pregnancy: of 290 new FDA labels approved between 2010 to 2019,
90% contain no human data on the risks or benefits for pregnant patients. With current evidence generation
systems, the mean time for evidence development in pregnancy has been estimated at 27 years, which is too
long. Current evidence generation relies largely on observational studies, typically prompted by signals from
animal studies or extrapolation from known pharmacological pathways, which may miss pregnancy-specific
context. Insufficient attention is also given to identifying causal mechanisms in vulnerable sub-populations at
greatest risk. Building on our prior work in data-mining in FDA’s Sentinel System and CDC’s Vaccine Safety
Datalink, conduct of pharmacoepidemiologic studies to evaluate prenatal medication safety, and pilot work with
special focus on drug scans in pregnancy, we will implement a three-stage novel reverse translational
framework to accelerate evidence generation that will use data-mining (“scans”) to identify new exposure-
outcome associations, triage signals, and then formally evaluate top prioritized signals. To accomplish our
goals, we will use our infrastructure developed for drug evaluations in pregnancy, including curated billing
records from the NIH Collaboratory’s Distributed Research Network and the national Medicaid Information
System, representing a broad cross-section of privately and publicly insured pregnant patients and their
offspring. Our specific aims are: (Aim 1) To scan for associations between (1a) pregnancy loss and
antecedent prenatal exposures on the individual drug, chemical and therapeutic class level; and (1b) the 50
most prevalent drugs in pregnancy with incomplete information on teratogenic risk and a broad selection of live
birth adverse outcomes; and (1c) to prioritize signals via expert panel review. (Aim 2) To employ careful
pharmacoepidemiologic designs to evaluate the two top prioritized signals involving (2a) pregnancy loss, and
(2b) an adverse livebirth outcome. To control for confounding and measurement biases, these studies will
employ previously validated measures, which are further enhanced via linkage to fetal death and birth
certificate data for a cohort subsample to evaluate unmeasured confounding and conduct probabilistic
sensitivity analyses on outcome and exposure misclassification. Big data apprOaches fOr Safe Therapeutics in
Healthy Pregnancies (BOOST-HP) will offer an innovative advancement in evidence generation by evaluating
numerous exposures and outcomes simultaneously. Our long-term goal is to build a reusable, scalable
approach and infrastructure to accelerate evidence generation on the safety and effectiveness of medication
use during pregnancy. By leveraging data-mining methodologies successfully deployed in public health
surveillance along with infrastructure used by multiple federal government agencies, we will focus research
efforts on novel, high-priority signals that pose the greatest risk to healthy pregnancies."

The overall goal of the Systems Biology and Biostatistics Core is to provide service to advance the knowledge
of systemic and gut human immunity in children and adults, by furnishing systems biology, bioinformatics, and
biostatistics expertise to strengthen, support, and augment the research conducted in the Research Projects.
The Systems Biology and Biostatistics Core aims to deliver expertise and service to perform integrative network
modeling of multiscale, multi-OMICs data to identify key drivers of disease severity and host response to
vaccination and infection. To reach this overall goal, the System Biology and Biostatistics Core will i) support the
Research Projects within the proposed Enteric CCHI by integrating the rich multi-OMICs, immunological, imaging
and clinical data generated within each project; ii) aid in validating the hypotheses generated in the Research
Projects to further our understanding of the protective immunological mechanisms of mucosal and systemic
immunity to vaccination and infection with enteric pathogens in children and adults; and iii) provide advanced
Biostatistics expertise. Such an endeavor requires state-of-the art integrative network approaches to construct,
analyze and validate multiscale networks of enteric bacterial infection and vaccination through integration of
large-scale molecular, cellular, and pathophysiological data in an unbiased manner. Our approaches will
incorporate these multi-dimensional data into mechanistic network models to predict outcomes of exposure to
wild-type and vaccine-strain bacteria and/or epigenetic immune modulators or adjuvants. Specifically, we will
develop and apply several novel differential analysis and multiscale network inference approaches to identify
molecular signatures, coexpression modules and causal relationships that will be further employed to discover
key regulators and pathways underlying vaccination and infection pertaining enteric pathogens. Such systems
approaches are completely data-driven and present global and unbiased maps of regulatory relationships
involving hundreds of thousands of interactions, with significantly improved power to uncover novel host-
pathogen pathways and driver genes. For this purpose, the Systems Biology and Biostatistics Core will deliver
the following: Aim 1, assembled large scale multi-omics datasets, identified molecular, clinical and
immunological signatures and integrated bulk and single-cell data, in particular cell-type information and B-cell
antibody repertoire; Aim 2, mechanistic molecular networks in response to vaccination and infection with enteric
pathogens; Aim 3, validated multiscale multi-Omics networks; and Aim 4, biostatistics expertise to help in the
development of optimal experimental designs. The Core’s leadership have demonstrated a strong track record
of employing systems biology and biostatistics approaches, ensuring the success of the proposed aims.
Therefore, we expect the service and expertise provided by the Systems Biology and Biostatistics Core will have
a profound impact on the proposed Enteric CCHI to advance our knowledge of systemic and gut human immunity
to accelerate the development of novel and better vaccines for enteric bacterial pathogens."
10821542,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Group 3 pulmonary hypertension due to interstitial lung disease (PH-ILD) is a devastating disease. Patients with
PH-ILD are perpetually short of breath and often unable to walk or even to speak in full sentences without gasping
for air. Characterized by extensive changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the vasculature, PH is observed
in up to 80% of patients with ILD. The severity of PH is the most significant predictor of mortality in these patients,
who have an average life expectancy of only 3-4 years. Existing therapies are often ineffective, in part because
they target individual cells and not the tissue remodeling that drives the disease. We desperately need new
therapies for PH-ILD.
There is strong evidence from in vitro and animal models of PH that hyaluronan (HA) drives disease progression.
HA, a prominent component of the ECM that fills the space between cells is overexpressed in the lungs of
patients with PH and is associated with vascular remodeling, inflammation, and fibrosis. Given the role of HA
and the ECM in PH-ILD pathogenesis, HA is an attractive target, one that is currently not targeted by approved
drugs or other drugs in development.
4-MU (4-methylumbelliferone) is a small molecule inhibitor of HA synthesis with the potential to treat PH-ILD. 4-
MU has shown dramatic preclinical efficacy in multiple mouse models of PH. Unfortunately, 4-MU has poor
pharmacokinetics, characterized by extensive 1st pass metabolism and poor bioavailability. While 4-MU works in
animal models at high dosages, we need improved formulations of 4-MU to be able to treat human PH-ILD.
We have developed an approach to the formulation of 4-MU that enhances systemic delivery, reduces 1st pass
metabolism, and promotes bioavailability (H1614). Our vision is that this formulation will result in reduced dose
burden and improved efficacy. To advance our program to deliver a proprietary agent for Phase 2 clinical
assessment we are proposing three specific aims for this grant application:
In Aim 1 we will manufacture 4-MU as an orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) using proprietary Zydis® technology
and evaluate the pharmacokinetics of the new formulation in an animal model.
Then, in Aim 2 we will perform preclinical studies to identify the optimal dose of 4-MU in a rat model of PH and
lung fibrosis and to define its toxicology profile to current FDA standards.
Finally, in Aim 3 we will validate assays to quantitate the levels of 4-MU and HA in human serum, in order to
ensure compliance with FDA standards to support the Phase 2 human clinical trial.
Completion of these studies will result in a proprietary, optimized formulation of 4-MU ready for manufacturing
to support a Phase 2 clinical trial in PH-ILD (WHO Group 3). Complementary studies of toxicology,
pharmacology, and human PK are to be undertaken directly by Halo Biosciences. This project has the potential
to transform the treatment not only of PH-ILD, but of other diseases characterized by inflammation and fibrosis."
10821609,"Project Summary
 Respiratory diseases (RDs) like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are among the
leading causes of death in the US and impose a major economic burden on the healthcare system. Early
detection and monitoring of a patient’s lung function, respiratory abnormalities and their exacerbations plays a
crucial role in evidence-based disease management to reduce morbidity, mortality, and cost associated with
COPD readmissions. Current monitoring and diagnostic methods rely on costly and time-consuming clinical
visits, discouraging preventative screening. Patients without severe symptoms often wait until they become
chronic and need more specialized care. In addition, diagnosis often relies on detection of intermittent abnormal
lung sounds and respiration patterns, which would benefit from prolonged recordings outside the clinic setting.
 Auscultation is a well-established non-invasive diagnostic method for RDs through detection of lung sounds.
Stethoscopes have been used by physicians for over two centuries, but they are unsuitable for extended and
remote monitoring of respiratory activity due to their large form-factor and dependence on continuous listening
and interpretation by an experienced physician. In this project, we aim to create a smart easy-to-use low-profile
wearable device for accurate detection and quantification of adventitious lung sounds as well as breathing
abnormalities via prolonged mechano-acoustic measurements without relying on continuous listening by a skilled
physician. To achieve this goal, StethX proposes to develop a battery-powered wireless wearable patch with a
small footprint close to a typical band-aid utilizing a novel hermetically-sealed low-noise and low-power chip-
scale contact microphone technology that is insensitive to airborne ambient sound.
 The wearable patch will be easy to apply and can be comfortably worn at multiple locations for prolonged
continuous auscultation measurement, accompanied with machine learning algorithms for automatic detection
and classification of wheezes, crackles, and breathing patterns. The contact microphone patch is immune to
airborne ambient sounds as it only picks up the subtle vibrations of a surface it is mounted on, with high
sensitivity. The patch can simultaneously record respiratory sounds in a wide frequency range up to 10 kHz,
along with low-frequency respiratory rate, heart rate, breathing pattern, and physical activities and position of the
wearer (DC and low-frequency contents). Performance of the miniaturized wearable patch will be optimized and
benchmarked against state-of-the-art digital stethoscopes for feasibility assessment. The feasibility study done
in Phase I of the project will pave the way for large-patient-pool evaluation and commercialization of the
technology in Phase II. Once commercialized, our wearable solution is expected to greatly improve the
accessibility, accuracy, and comprehensiveness of asthma and COPD diagnosis with prolonged recording and
a pathway to automatic pathological signal detection by digitizing respiratory sound signals and correlating it with
heart sounds and chest motions."

Translational research is critically dependent on availability of adequate specimens from well-defined clinical
cohorts of patients. This Clinical Core builds and maintains such cohorts and facilitates a broad array of studies
in human immunology. During the past three cycles of our consortium, we successfully recruited and enrolled
over two thousand subjects, leveraging two paradigm-shifting therapeutic advances of this century: effective
direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) against hepatitis C virus (HCV) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs),
particularly targeting the PD-1 axis, for cancer. These developments allowed unique opportunities to study the
scars left by human chronic viral infection and to explore the reversal of T-cell exhaustion and resetting of
immunity. We can further capitalize on “the human experiment” by dissecting immune mechanisms in humans
where a single immune pathway involved in the germinal center response can be interrogated by capturing
standard of care vaccination in patients receiving αPD-1. Finally, during the last cycle a global immunological
challenge in the COVID-19 pandemic spurred a third major advance of this century: the introduction of SARS-
CoV-2 mRNA vaccines. While their biology and clinical courses differ, SARS-CoV-2 and HCV are each RNA
viruses where immune responses and outcomes can be compared. Moreover, we can dissect differences
between immune responses to vaccination for Flu and SARS-CoV-2. Samples collected by the Clinical Core
will allow examination of three areas of immunobiology: 1) investigation of persisting virus and immune
dysfunction in post-acute sequelae of PASC; 2) interrogation of immune scarring after cure of a persisting
infection, and 3) dissection of an immunoregulatory pathway associated with persisting infections for its role in
vaccine-induced adaptive immune memory. Integration of findings across these areas is a distinct advantage of
this Immune Perturbation Study Group (IPSG), empowered by this Clinical Core and its relevant cohorts and
large numbers of well-annotated samples. By supporting the studies described in the Projects and the Immune
Health Core, this Core will facilitate a novel and integrated examination of human immune responses to viral
pathogens and to their vaccines in the context of three key perturbations: PASC, HCV infection and specific
immune manipulation via αPD-1."
10825346,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The La Jolla CCHI team will investigate pathogen-specific memory T and B cell responses in the blood, and in
lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues in the upper airways, where many airborne infectious pathogens entry and
replicate. In Project 3, we will focus on understanding the factors (smoking status, older age, diabetes,
vaccination) associated with the magnitude, persistence and quality of pathogen-specific tissue-resident memory
T cells (TRM cells) in the upper airway tissue. Upper airway TRM cells play important roles in protection against
infection by airborne pathogens. Despite their importance, very little is known about the factors like vaccination
routes, co-morbidities like age, diabetes, smoking status that influence the generation of pathogen/vaccine-
specific TRM cells in human upper airway tissue. We have extensive expertise in understanding the biology of
TRM cells, having shown their importance in driving anti-PD1 therapy T cell responses in human cancers. Here,
we will examine the biology of infection-elicited and vaccine-elicited TRM cells in upper airway tissue samples
obtained during routine surgery from 200 living donors. These donors are relatively fit for elective surgery and
are enrolled in TARGET head and neck study, a prospective observational study that grows by ~20 cases/month
at tertiary health centers, and now includes vaccination (TARGET vaccination) as an intervention prior to surgery.
Our studies will expand well beyond SARS-CoV-2 to understand the diversity of TRM cells specific to viral
(Influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, varicella zoster virus, human papilloma
virus), bacterial (pertussis) and fungal pathogens. Studies in Aim 1 will determine the correlation of three
important immunomodulating co-morbidities (smoking, older age and diabetes) with features (frequency,
phenotype and persistency) of pathogen/vaccine-specific TRM cells in the upper airway tissue. We will test the
hypothesis that key co-morbidities like smoking, older age and diabetes are associated with defects in pathogen-
specific TRM cell responses in airways. For studies in Aim 2, we will vaccinate donors 2-4 weeks prior to surgery
and determine vaccine-responsive TRM cells in upper airway tissue. We hypothesize that parenteral (i.m.)
vaccination can also induce/boost (pre-existing) TRM responses in the upper airways. This hypothesis is based
on recent studies in model organisms and humans, which suggests that parental vaccination may induce/boost
TRM responses in lungs. Because most donors would have had prior exposure to the antigens present in these
vaccines by either infection or vaccination – a real-life scenario – our analysis will largely assess effects on pre-
existing memory T cells. Overall, studies proposed in this Project that complement studies in Project 1 & 2 will
provide important insights into the nature of TRM responses in humans."
10825430,"Abstract
Rotavirus (RV) infection causes life-threatening, dehydrating diarrhea and is the leading cause of diarrheal
deaths among children <5 years old despite availability of a vaccine. Critically, the oral vaccine is less effective
in middle- and low-income countries where disproportionately more deaths occur compared to high-income
countries. Addressing this disparity in vaccine effectiveness is a major public health priority. Correlates of
protection do not exist, and cellular responses against RV in humans remain incompletely understood.
Mounting evidence supports a direct role for the gut microbiota in modulating humoral and cellular immune
responses to oral vaccines, but little is known about their actual mechanism of action. In our pilot study,
vaccine responders had a significantly greater abundance of Bifidobacterium longum and higher content of
microbial genes associated with folate transformation in their gut compared to nonresponders. These data
suggest that infants may depend on microbes such as B. longum to synthesize folate de novo as a mechanism
for RV-specific immune cell expansion. We hypothesize that de novo folate synthesis by microbes such
as B. longum facilitates RV-specific immune cell expansion, and that levels of folate modulate vaccine
immunogenicity. We propose to study 330 infants from the US, Panama, and Peru where vaccine efficacy is
known to be high, medium and low, respectively, by using both stored and prospectively collected longitudinal
samples of blood and stool from infants 0 to 12 months of age. We have designed a novel RV “megapool” of
immunogenic peptides to define cellular immune responses to RV vaccination in addition to assessing
traditional serum RV-specific IgA and stool RV shedding after immunization (Aim 1). We will characterize gut
microbial composition and function using metagenomic sequencing at multiple pre-vaccination time points in
vaccine responders and nonresponders to determine if the abundance of B. longum and capacity to synthesize
folate predict vaccine immunogenicity (Aim 2). We will analyze the metabolic byproducts to identify if folate or
other metabolites enhance vaccine response (Aim 3). Our unique team of experts in vaccinology, immunology,
microbiology, biochemistry, and bioinformatics will ensure successful integrative analysis and interpretation of
these immunologic and multi-omics data. Completion of the study will provide a comprehensive
characterization of microbial and metabolic biomarkers of RV vaccine responses, paving the way for targeted
immune augmentation strategies."

 Many children with cerebral palsy (CP) show impairments in trunk postural control, which significantly
impact their walking capacity and daily activities. For instance, children with severe CP, who have difficulties
sitting independently, show poor directional specificity, with antagonists activating before agonists, which is
distinct from typically developed children. Compared to typically developed peers, children with CP have a
large range of motion for pelvis tilt, thorax, head, and kyphosis and lordosis during gait, even for some high
functioning children with CP. While the significance of trunk motor control dysfunction in children with CP has
been recognized, effective interventions for this core deficit are still lacking. Children with CP often receive or
participate in a wide range of passive and active interventions aimed to improve postural control, but results
have shown that current intervention approaches are not often effective in improving postural control in
children with CP. For instance, hippotherapy, an intervention strategy that applies rhythmical force
perturbations to the pelvis during sitting astride using horseback movement, has been used for improving
balance and gait in children with CP for decades. However, while some studies showed improvements in
balance and motor function in children with CP after hippotherapy, other studies indicated a mixed result
regarding the effect of hippotherapy on Gross Motor Function Measure scores in children with CP. Thus, there
is a critical need to improve the efficacy of current interventions for improving trunk postural control and gait in
children with CP, which requires a thorough examination of the underlying neuromuscular mechanisms of the
interventions. Our long-term goal is to develop rational-based intervention strategies to improve trunk postural
control and gait in children with CP. The overall objective of this study is to examine the neuromuscular
mechanisms of the trunk muscles to a force perturbation applied to the pelvis during sitting astride, and
determine whether repeated exposure to pelvic perturbations during sitting astride using a robotic system will
be effective in improving trunk postural control and gait in children with CP. Our central hypothesis is that
repetitive activation of specific sensorimotor pathways through applying targeted force perturbations will
improve postural control in children with CP, which may be due to the reinforcement in circuits and synapses
used for trunk postural control through a use-dependent neuroplasticity mechanism. The rationale for the
proposed study is that an understanding of the neuromuscular mechanisms of trunk muscle control in children
with CP and determination of the therapeutic effect of targeted force perturbation are likely to provide a strong
scientific foundation whereby new force perturbation based intervention strategies can be developed to
improve postural control and gait in children with CP. The results from this study may be used to develop
innovative clinical therapies aimed at improving trunk postural control and walking function in children with CP."

 Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are responsible for 10,000 documented deaths every year in the
US. While most aneurysms are asymptomatic, highly lethal complications, rupture and dissection do occur in a
subset of patients. Aneurysm diameter is the best-known predictor of its propensity to rupture, and
accordingly, aneurysm repair is recommended for large, or symptomatic AAA. However, many ruptures
occur in smaller aneurysms that do not meet the criteria for repair; and conversely, some larger aneurysms
do not rupture. AAA treatment remains limited to surgical or endovascular repair, as several promising medical
therapies have failed in clinical studies. As such, novel tools (e.g., molecular imaging) are needed to better risk
stratify patients, develop effective medical therapies, and monitor therapeutic effectiveness. Matrix
metalloproteinases (MMP) activation promotes vascular remodeling in AAA, in part through degradation of
elastin and other matrix proteins. Our previous studies have established the feasibility of MMP-targeted
imaging to detect vascular remodeling by micro single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT in
murine models of aneurysm. However, a number of limitations of the SPECT tracer and technology precluded
clinical translation for vascular imaging. To address these limitations, we developed a novel family of MMP-
targeted tracers (RYM) with improved pharmacokinetics, including a first in the class positron emission
tomography (PET) tracer, 64Cu-RYM2. Here, we seek to further develop, evaluate, and clinically translate
64Cu-RYM2 for first in human imaging studies in AAA, hypothesizing that MMP PET/CT imaging with 64Cu-
RYM2 can detect AAA MMP activity. Our specific aims are to evaluate 64Cu-RYM2 binding to human AAA
tissue; address 64Cu-RYM2 pharmacokinetics and imaging performance in murine AAA in relation to tissue
MMP activity; and translate 64Cu-RYM2 for human AAA imaging. Leveraging the resources and
complementary expertise of the PIs and co-investigators at Yale School of Medicine and Washington
University, including an NIBIB-funded P41- center at Washington University, these studies will establish the
potential of 64Cu-RYM2 to quantify MMP activation in human AAA, and set the stage for a multi-center trial of
MMP PET/CT imaging for AAA risk stratification."
10824319,"The cation channel TRPV2 is important in development and function of the cardiovascular system. Multiple
studies suggest it is gated in response to mechanical stimulus, but the mechanism appears to be indirect and
is not yet known. Drugs targeting either activation or inhibition of TRPV2 have been reported to have beneficial
effects on pathological cardiovascular symptoms in both animal models and clinical studies, but the available
drugs have poor specificity and potency. The goal of this project is to develop a better understanding of the
structural and cellular basis of TRPV2 regulation, and to begin the process of developing more specific and
efficacious inhibitors and activators. Specific Aim 1 is to determine the effects of phosphoinositides and
mechanical stress on TRPV2 activity in a purified and reconstituted state. Phosphoinositide composition will be
manipulated and channel activity with and without added agonists and inhibitors, or in response to mechanical
stimulus, will be measured using Ca2+-indicator dyes or with patch-clamp electrophysiology. These
experiments will test the hypothesis that TRPV2 is a constitutively active channel and subject to negative
regulation by phosphatidylinositol (4,5) bisphosphate (PIP2), as well as the counter hypotheses that PIP2 is
stimulatory or alters channel selectivity or that effects of phosphoinositides are indirect. They will also test the
hypothesis that TRPV2 is directly mechanosensitive. Specific Aim 2 is to determine the effects of
phosphoinositides and mechanical stress on TRPV2 activity in the context of cellular membranes. TRPV2 will
be expressed in cultured cells and assayed using Ca2+-flux assays and patch clamp experiments. Expression
of recombinant enzymes engineered to respond to extracellular ligands, or to membrane voltage, as well as
fluorescently tagged phosphoinositide binding domains and inhibitors, will be used to manipulate and monitor
phosphoinositides on the cytoplasmic face of the membrane. These experiments will test the hypothesis that
TRPV2 is regulated by intracellular phosphoinositides and membrane tension in a cellular context. Specific
Aim 3: Determine the structural basis for regulation of TRPV2. The structure of TRPV2 in lipid nanodics will be
determined in the presence of phosphoinositides as well as agonists and inhibitors using cryo-electron
microscopy. Mutagenesis experiments will target residues proposed to play important roles in regulation by
phosphoinositides or other effectors. Mutations will be tested for their effects on function and structure. These
experiments will further test the hypothesis that direct interactions mediate the effects of these regulatory
molecules and identify the structural basis for those which do so. Accomplishment of these aims will make a
major contribution to our understanding of the general principles governing the regulation of ion channels of the
TRPV family, clarify the mechanistic basis for the roles of TRPV2 in normal physiology and disease, and help
to guide future therapeutic efforts relying on TRPV2 regulation as a target."

The neurobiological basis of chronic pain is poorly understood and no scientifically validated therapies exist for
such condition. Yet, chronic pain has an enormous socio-economic price, estimated to reach US$ 635 billion
annually in healthcare costs and lost productivity. To make things worse, the majority of opioid abusers begin
their addiction with prescription medications for chronic pain. Consequently, the search for new, non-opioid,
pharmacological treatments for chronic pain constitutes one of the most urgent unmet medical needs. Beside
its sensory symptoms, chronic pain is characterized by impairment of cognitive tasks such as attention and
working memory, which depend on cholinergic modulation of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Accordingly,
mPFC deactivation was found to have a causal role for the neuropathic pain phenotype, and our preliminary
data show that excitatory cholinergic modulation is severely impaired in mPFC pyramidal neurons of male rats.
Yet, the precise mechanisms mediating the mPFC deactivation, how this deactivation influences pain
perception and cognitive performance, and whether it similarly impacts males and females remain largely
unknown. Our preliminary data show that a current mediated by the M1 receptor is critical for mPFC pyramidal
cell excitability and is strongly reduced in neuropathic pain; our overarching hypothesis is that impaired
cholinergic modulation of the mPFC represents a major mechanism of mPFC deactivation in neuropathic pain
and mediates several of the sensory, cognitive and emotional symptoms. In particular, we hypothesize that in
neuropathic pain: (1) cholinergic modulation of mPFC activity is disrupted and this critically contributes to the
global mPFC deactivation in both sexes; (2) blockade of M1-mediated mPFC excitation is sufficient to mimic, at
least in part, the neuropathic pain phenotype; (3) pharmacological manipulations that counterbalance the
cholinergic disruption and restore mPFC output ameliorate cognitive and sensory symptoms of neuropathic
pain. To test these hypotheses we will take advantage of the Spared-Nerve-Injury (SNI) model of neuropathic
pain to pursue two specific aims. In Aim 1 we will combine optogenetic activation of individual cholinergic
inputs, patch clamp recordings in acute slices and PCR analysis, to test the hypothesis that impaired
cholinergic modulation contributes to the global mPFC deactivation, to determine the identity of the receptors
involved, and to dissect the relative impact of cholinergic inputs from local interneurons and from the basal
forebrain on mPFC activity in both females and males. In Aim 2 we will test the behavioral effects of impaired
mPFC cholinergic modulation. We will use in-vivo chemogenetic and pharmacological modulation of the mPFC
to reverse the SNI phenotype. We obtained preliminary data showing that enhancing mPFC excitability through
pharmacological antagonism of the 5HT1a receptor has potent analgesic effects. Conversely, we will also
investigate whether blockade of M1-mediated mPFC excitation in naive animals is sufficient to mimic the SNI
phenotype. Our work will thus identify new potential targets for non-opioid neuropathic pain treatment."
10825438,"PROJECT SUMMARY All motor commands flow through motoneurons in the spinal cord and brainstem. As
for inputs to neural circuits throughout the CNS, these commands comprise three main components: two types
of ionotropic input (excitation and inhibition) and a set of G-protein coupled inputs (neuromodulation). Lack of
understanding of how these components produce output constitutes a fundamental uncertainty at the
foundation of the neural control of movement. Fortunately, motor output in humans can be studied at the level
of single neurons. Motoneuron action potentials are 1-to-1 with those of their muscle fibers, forming motor
units whose action potentials can be recorded relatively easily in muscles. The potential for using these motor
unit firing patterns for understanding motor commands has long been appreciated. Our goal is to maximize
this potential by developing supercomputer-based techniques for reverse engineering motor unit firing patterns
to identify the amplitudes and patterns of the excitatory, inhibitory and neuromodulatory inputs underlying
motor commands in humans. Recent advances that allow simultaneous recording of many motor units have
allowed us to identify distinctive nonlinear behaviors in motor unit firing patterns. Our development of realistic
models of motoneurons show that these nonlinearities arise from complex interactions between input
components. We plan to use these models as the core of a reverse engineering (RE) approach that estimates
these three components from nonlinear human motor unit firing patterns. Our premise is that implementation
of our models on supercomputers at Argonne National Laboratories will allow systematic exploration of the
firing patterns generated by many thousands of input combinations. Those input organizations that accurately
recreate a measured set of firing patterns will then be considered to be part of the “solution space” for that
particular motor output. The key problem for this analysis is redundancy. If the same motor output can be
produced by many input combinations, then reverse engineering will reveal huge solution spaces that provide
little insight into motor commands. Overall motor outputs like force and EMG suffer from this problem. Our
concept, however, is that measuring motor output at the single neuron level, via motor unit recordings, allows
for effective reverse engineering. We have 3 aims: 1) to develop and evaluate supercomputer-based reverse
engineering techniques for analysis of motor unit firing patterns. 2) to deploy RE to investigate the
mechanisms of muscle-specific differences in populations of motor unit firing patterns. And 3) to deploy RE to
investigate whether inhibitory-neuromodulation interactions that are specific for each muscle are relatively
fixed, or instead are continuously adapted for different motor tasks. The development of supercomputer-based
analysis techniques provides an ideal complement to emergence of techniques to measure firing patterns of
large populations of motor units. Our novel reverse engineering method have the potential to transform our

This application for a K01 Mentored Research Scientist Award is submitted by Xiaojuan Li, PhD in response to
PA-20-190. Dr. Li is a pharmacoepidemiologist and Instructor in the Department of Population Medicine at
Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute. Her long-term goal is to develop an
independent research career contributing to the appropriate and optimal use of medical treatments in patients
with complex healthcare needs. Dr. Li has a background in pharmacoepidemiologic methods and causal
inference. This mentored research and training experience will integrate her methodological research skills into
clinical geriatric research. Within the highly productive and supportive research environment at the Department
of Population Medicine, Dr. Li will work with an interdisciplinary team of highly committed and collaborative
mentors that have deep expertise and extensive experience in the specific areas of her proposed training:
clinical geriatrics, diabetology, frailty, semiparametric methods, and machine learning. The overarching
objective of this K01 application is to understand the long-term comparative effectiveness and safety of newer
antihyperglycemic agents in older adults in routine care while applying, developing, and disseminating state-of-
the-art analytical and causal inference methods, ultimately optimizing clinical care decisions for older adults
with diabetes and heart failure. While these newer antihyperglycemic agents have reported cardiovascular
benefit in placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), little is known about how to choose among
an expanded range of medication choices for older patients who are often excluded or underrepresented.
These trials do not provide head-to-head comparisons either. This proposal seeks to fill the critical gaps in the
evidence base by utilizing the rich information in high-dimensional electronic healthcare databases, the target
trial emulation framework, and novel causal inference and statistical tools. Aim 1 will refine the trial emulation
framework by emulating two published RCTs using modern causal and statistical approaches and benchmark
these methods by comparing effect estimates from each RCT with those from their observational emulation.
The extent of agreement between the effect estimates measures the validity of the emulation framework and
analytical methods and will guide our confidence in the observational emulation of other target trials to assess
comparative safety and effectiveness of the newer agents with different eligibility criteria, head-to-head
treatment comparisons, and outcomes for which actual RCTs are not available or infeasible (Aims 2 & 3). The
findings will improve the evidence base for decision-making available for clinicians treating older patients,
promote effective and safe drug therapy, and ultimately improve the care of older patients, which aligns with
the National Institute on Aging’s missions and initiatives. Completion of the proposed career development and
mentored research will position Dr. Li to successfully compete for future R01 funding and make significant
contributions to geriatric pharmacoepidemiology research and improve the lives of older adults."
10824331,"Cardiomyopathy (CMY) is a worldwide problem associated with high morbidity and mortality. CMY patients may
present with symptoms attributed to heart failure (HF), arrhythmias, cardiac conduction system abnormalities,
and sudden cardiac death. Recently it has been increasingly recognized that genetic screening for etiologies of
CMY is important, and that defects in cardiomyocyte (CM) proteins in cellular junctions can cause CMY.
Mechanical and electrical coupling of CM occurs at the intercellular connection between CM, termed the
intercalated disk (ID). The ID provides essential properties to allow the heart to function as a syncytium. Structural
elements of the cardiac conduction system (CCS) such as the atrioventricular (AV) and sinoatrial (SA) nodes
have cellular arrangements and intercellular connections that vary from working CMs in the atrium and ventricle.
Understanding more about proteins essential for normal function of working CMs and CCS cells is critical to
advance our knowledge of the basis of cardiac disease, and remains understudied.
This proposal is focused on Vinculin (VCL) and Zonula Occludens (ZO) proteins, which bind directly to
one another, are located in the ID and the lateral membrane of working CMs and have known links to
human disease. Our global hypothesis here is that VCL, ZO-1 and ZO-2 have unique roles in preserving cardiac
function, conduction, and rhythm, given their location in CMs and in the CCS. We propose two aims.
AIM 1 will evaluate how loss of ZO and VCL proteins from CMs alters contractile function and the
molecular phenotype of the working CM and adult heart. We hypothesize that with postnatal loss of CM ZO
and VCL proteins, cell-cell communication and integrity of the working myocardium will be disturbed, resulting in
contractile dysfunction. CM ZO loss is expected to be distinct from that caused by loss of CM VCL, despite these
proteins directly binding one another. Unique mouse models in hand will be used to evaluate the effects of loss
of ZO and VCL from mature CMs basally and after the heart is faced with stress. We will assess whole heart,
tissue and single cells using physiological, biochemical, and microscopic evaluations, as well as a novel
approach to single cell transcriptomics and single cell proteomics, to pursue the mechanistic basis for how ZO
and VCL protein loss causes CMY. Differences by sex and in atria vs. ventricle will be considered.
AIM 2 will determine the function of ZO-1 and VCL in cardiac conduction and rhythm. Deletion of VCL
from CM caused ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death, while loss of CM ZO-1 produced CCS dysfunction.
We hypothesize that these two proteins have unique roles in controlling cardiac rhythm and conduction,
despite their direct binding, due to interactions with connexins and membrane ion channels. Using patch
clamping, high-resolution confocal microscopy to detect Ca2+ transients, optical voltage/Ca2+ mapping, and single
cell transcriptional and proteomic studies, we will test how loss of ZO-1 leads to altered SAN and AVN function
and excitation-contraction coupling, and how loss of VCL leads to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death."

Chronic viral infections are associated with functional impairment of innate and adaptive immunity, including the
development of T cell exhaustion. We and others recently showed that these functional defects persist even after
cure of chronic viremia and are associated with irreversible molecular and epigenetic “scars”. With the rise of
treatment options, ranging from antivirals to immunomodulatory therapies or even therapeutic vaccines, attention
in biomedical research has shifted to understanding the long-term immune sequelae of chronic infection: how
does the irreversible regulatory wiring within virus-specific exhausted T cells mediate dysfunction? How does
chronic infection exposure impact bystander innate as well as adaptive responses and how durable are these
effects? This is an important knowledge gap preventing the identification of regulatory pathways as well as
relevant cell types that can be targeted to reverse long-lasting immune dysregulation in chronic infection. In
Project 2, we focus on a fundamental, yet understudied aspect of persistent viral infection: the impact
on existing as well as de novo antiviral responses, and we explore new strategies for modulating immune
dysfunction. This problem is ideally studied in human cohorts since animal models cannot mimic the breadth
and timescale of immune exposures in humans. Chronic HCV infection is a unique model system in humans to
study fundamental principles of antiviral immunity – it can cause self-limited acute infection or progress to chronic
disease in healthy adults and remains the only persistent virus that can be fully cured. Therefore, we propose to
use HCV as a pathognomonic disease context to test our overarching hypothesis that chronic infection leads
to broadly dysregulated innate and adaptive responses and that targeted modulation of key molecular
pathways can rescue immune dysfunction. Specifically, we will 1) test whether reversal of known immune
sequelae/”scars” in chronic infection through epigenetic reprogramming can rescue T cell exhaustion, 2) assess
the impact of chronic infection and its cure on bystander T cell differentiation and function, and 3) test how altered
innate myeloid responses following chronic viral infection (HCV) affects inflammatory setpoint and heterologous
vaccine responses. Upon completion of this Project, we will have identified specific mechanistic interventions
that can restore exhausted T cell function by reversing previously defined regulatory “scars”. We will also have
delineated more broadly the immune sequelae of chronic infection on bystander innate and adaptive cells. These
studies are intended to establish new paradigms for antiviral immunity in humans and will ultimately act as proof-
of-concept for new intervention strategies that can enhance or modulate anti-viral immunity with high specificity.
Importantly, this Project will closely interact with Projects 1 and 3, to compare and contrast the immune
perturbation mediated by severe acute infection with long-term sequelae (Project 1) or αPD-1 immunotherapy
(Project 3) to chronic infection followed by viral cure (Project 2). This will help us to develop an integrated
understanding of how prior immune exposures alter antiviral immunity and overall host health."

Critical limb ischemia (CLI) affects 2 million Americans with peripheral artery disease (PAD) each year and is a
frequent cause of persistent ulcers and wounds, amputations, hospitalizations with frequent re-admissions, and
death due to reduced blood flow to the affected limb. Untreated, CLI patients survive under 2 years. The main
treatment for CLI is to increase blood flow to improve limb perfusion using extremity artery bypass. When the
patient’s own vein is insufficient peripheral vascular grafts (PVG), frequently made from expanded
polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), are used as a synthetic graft is used for both segments. Unfortunately, PVG
have failure rates ranging from 20% to 50% within the first year of surgery, which increases to >60% after 5
years. The primary reasons for PVG failure are neointimal hyperplasia, occlusion via thrombosis, and infection.
No current or in-development technology successfully addresses these challenges.
FreeFlow Medical Devices (FFMD) is aiming to optimize and commercialize tethered liquid perfluorocarbon
(TLP) coatings on medical devices. Our TLP coating stops the adhesion of all biological components (bacteria,
fungi, blood components) to the surface of medical devices by immobilizing a thin layer of highly inert and
biocompatible perfluorinated liquid. Our preliminary data demonstrate that our TLP coating effectively resists
occlusion and pathogen colonization on vascular devices under physiological flow conditions.
In this Fast Track proposal, we will investigate the ability of TLP PVG to resist occlusion, thrombus formation,
and biofilm formation, which all contribute to graft dysfunction We will also finalize the TLP additive packaging
for GMP manufacturing in Phase II. This will be achieved using six Aims. Phase 1 Aim 1. Perform a 90-day in
vitro TLP PVG characterization to understand the durability and characteristics of the coating after 90 days.
Phase 1 Aim 2. Perform a 60-day protein biofouling study to test the ability of TLP surfaces to resist protein
adsorption since biofilm development, thrombus progression, and neointimal hyperplasia all begin with protein
adsorption. Phase 1 Aim 3. Perform 30-day in vitro thrombogenicity testing. Phase 2 Aim 4. Obtain GMP-
manufactured TLP PVG. Phase 2 Aim 5. Perform an efficacy study to compare the in vivo effectiveness of TLP
PVG with standard PVG (BD Impra®) at reducing thrombin formation, neointimal hypoplasia, and stenosis.
Phase 2 Aim 6. Initiate the 510(k) application process to obtain FDA premarketing approval and perform a
biocompatibility study. These advances will allow FFMD to maximize the effectiveness of the TLP coating and
dramatically improve PVG patient care by reducing graft failure dure to neointimal hyperplasia, infection, and
thrombosis."

 An organism’s response to environmental perturbations is a complex process that is influenced by the
interplay between genetic and environmental factors. However, despite playing a critical role in health and
survival, the gene-by-environment interactions (GxE) shaping disease susceptibility remain poorly understood.
Understanding the genomic mechanisms underlying GxE is therefore essential for understanding the
consequences of genetic variation on genomic function and complex traits.
 The immune response to infectious agents is a GxE interaction with clear consequences for health and
survival. Mounting an appropriate immune response is essential, but substantial genetic variation in immune
function exists within and between species. This makes immune responses an ideal system to understand how
genetic and environmental variation interact to shape genome function. Specifically, comparative studies
leveraging genetic variation within and between species can help reveal the genomic mechanisms for GxE, while
also shedding light on the molecular basis for differences in susceptibility to infectious disease.
 The research questions driving this proposal are: How does genetic variation, both within and between
primate species, influence the gene expression response to immunological perturbations? What are the gene
regulatory mechanisms that mediate the relationship between gene expression and genetic variation? Which
genetic variants are causally connected to variation in the gene expression response? To answer these
questions, I will characterize the transcriptomic response to immune stimuli in peripheral blood cells using a
powerful, in vitro assay and single-cell sequencing. This project will identify GxE interactions that are cell type,
stimuli, and species-specific. I will then profile chromatin accessibility to identify key regulatory elements involved
in the response to immune perturbation and use experimental assays to causally link genetic variation to
differences in the response. This project is therefore an ambitious, novel integration of functional and
population genetic approaches to study how the genome responds to environmental perturbations. At
its conclusion, this study will reveal how immune GxE interactions have evolved among primates, improving our
understanding of genome function and the genetic basis for complex traits."

the skills needed to build my academic career by investigating prenatal pesticide exposure and child lung
function and asthma outcomes, assessing environmental health literacy, and implementing effective
dissemination strategies.
Formal coursework and the expert mentorship of Drs. Kecia N. Carroll, Maria José Rosa, Maida Galvez,
Robert O. Wright, Syam Andra, Shelley Liu, Elizabeth Roberts, and Hector Lamadrid-Figueroa will enable me
to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to become an independent transdisciplinary researcher. This
training will allow me to achieve my short and long- term career goals: leading efforts to incorporate prenatal
pesticide assessment and environmental health literacy into the ongoing Programming Research in Obesity,
Growth, Environment, and Social Stressors (PROGRESS) cohort based in Mexico City in order to delineate
prenatal pesticide effects on child lung function and asthma while engaging participants and the community
to inform future interventions. I will train in 1) prenatal programming of child lung disease with Drs. Kecia N.
Carroll and Maria José Rosa; 2) toxicology with Drs. Robert O. Wright and Syam Andra; 3) advanced
statistical methods with Dr. Shelley Liu; 4) implementation science, translational research, and community
outreach with Dr. Maida Galvez; 5) ethnographic and qualitative research approaches with Dr. Elizabeth
Roberts; and 5) fieldwork management with Dr. Hector Lamadrid-Figueroa. I will integrate research on
prenatal pesticides, lung function and asthma, and environmental health literacy through interactions with my
mentorship team to become a transdisciplinary scientist. With their guidance, I will establish myself as an
independent investigator with a tenure track faculty position and to position myself for a future R01.
 This proposal will address gaps regarding prenatal pesticide exposure in urban settings particularly in
Latin America, associations with child adverse respiratory outcomes, and factors that may modify
associations, as these are understudied research areas. The proposed research and training plan builds the
foundation for an independent research career that aims to study prenatal environmental exposure effects on
child respiratory health, environmental health literacy, and effective dissemination strategies. This study is
also highly cost effective as we leverage the resources of the longitudinal PROGRESS study with existing
biospecimens, lung function and other respiratory outcomes, and well-characterized covariate data."

Blood cancers account for approximately 10% of all malignancies and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation
(BMT) is a preferred curative therapy for these serious conditions. While the therapeutic potential of this
procedure lies in graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects in which donor T and NK cells eradicate host malignancy,
BMT outcomes are limited by transplant-related complications, mainly graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in
which donor T cells attack host normal tissues and opportunistic infections. Indeed, 15-20% of BMT patients
develop severe GVHD that is fatal, particularly when involving the gastrointestinal tract, however, relapse of the
primary malignancy is still high and eventually responsible for the majority (40-60%) of transplant failures and
death. Current prevention and treatment of GVHD which rely on the broad suppression of T cells abate GVL
effects. Thus, the immunological intervention to minimize GVHD with promoting GVL is unmet need in BMT. The
initiation and maintenance of donor T cell responses are dependent on alloantigen presentation by antigen-
presenting cells (APC). Although recently the types of APC that induce and enhance GVHD and the
immunological mechanisms therein have been elucidated, their role in GVL and the presence of GVL-specific
APC remain unknown. In this proposal, we focus on GVL-requiring APC to enhance GVL and precent leukemia
relapse. In particular, we will build on our preliminary data to test the hypothesis that donor T cells primed at
extramedullary sites migrate into the BM where their anti-leukemic capacity is maintained via alloantigen
presentation by recipient stromal APC. We will utilize cutting-edge mechanistic preclinical murine studies, using
advanced flow cytometry, multiplexed immunofluorescence microscopy, RNASeq, and REAP/CITE-seq, to
understand antigen presentation required for effective GVL and relapse prevention. Finally, we will test a novel
attenuated synthetic IL-18 resistant to the IL-18 binding protein (decoy resistant (DR-18)) that has been fused to
CXCR4 nanobody or CD117 antibody to selectively enhance IFNg and antigen presentation locally in the bone
marrow. The proposal will lead to a new, clinically tractable approach to selectively promote GVL and prevent
relapse after allogeneic BMT."

The research focuses on examining African American children across a broad range of socioeconomic
statuses (SES), avoiding the inherent confound in examination of only low-income African American children.
In the proposed research, cognitive processes (fluid reasoning, executive functioning, and crystallized

and instructional support), student-teacher relationships (warmth and conflict), and home environmental
stimulation to elucidate determinants of reading and math achievement among an economically diverse
sample of African American children. A primary aim of the research is also to examine the impact of COVID-19
on the educational attainment of African American children. The research is a natural experiment involving
longitudinal follow-up of an economically diverse sample of 198 African American children originally assessed
in their preschool, kindergarten, and early elementary school years and a new cohort of children who
experienced a disruption in their preschool year due to COVID-19. The proposed research will have a
significant impact on improving educational outcomes in African American children by enhancing our
understanding of the child x environment processes that influence reading and math achievement in this
underserved population. Results of the research can be used in developing treatments, interventions, or
policies concerning early childhood development and education for this understudied population, thereby

about cognition in the context of a cancer management decision. This proposal is important because
approximately 7% of older adults diagnosed with cancer have pre-existing dementia. For older adults with
ADRD and cancer, medical decision making is more complex, and integrates information about the risks and
benefits of potential interventions in the context of the dual diagnoses. Limited data are available to guide the
“best” approach and thus, relies on discussions about the risks and benefits of options in the context of patient
and care partner goals and preferences. Unfortunately, there is no standard approach among oncology
clinicians as to how to discuss cognition in the context of a cancer management decision for patients with pre-
existing ADRD and their care partners. Preliminary research by the PI (Magnuson) and team suggest that
cognitive impairment is prevalent in older patients with cancer and that a geriatric assessment-based
communication tool can facilitate conversations about aging-related conditions, such as cognition, with older
patients and their care partners. However, the intervention was not tested in patients with ADRD and did not
address patient and care partner concerns about cognition in the context of cancer. Adapting this tool for
patients with ADRD (adapted tool called “COACH-Cog”) may improve both care partner and patient outcomes
through greater acknowledgement and support of cognitive concerns and cognitive-related goals, thereby
improving goal concordant care. COACH-Cog adaptations will include: 1) brief, focused training for oncology
clinicians about ADRD in the context of cancer and communication training to navigate the triadic nature of
these conversations, thereby enhancing oncology clinician knowledge and supporting their decision processes;
and 2) care partner and patient Communication Coaching and Question Prompt List providing knowledge,
skills, and behavioral cueing for discussing their cognitive concerns and cognitive-related goals with oncology
clinicians. Focus groups with key stakeholders will guide the adaptation. Subsequently, we propose to conduct
a pilot, Stage I RCT (cluster randomized at physician) with older adults with a clinical diagnosis of ADRD and
their care partners (N=130 dyads) to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of COACH-Cog on care partner and
patient autonomy support, care partner well-being, and goal concordance in outcomes at 3 months. Our
uniquely qualified, multidisciplinary team includes expertise in geriatric oncology, cognition, behavioral
neurology, intervention development, communication science, biostatistics, palliative care, and care partner
research. This innovative proposal will develop a pragmatic tool for improving communication about cognition
in the context of cancer treatment decision making for patients with ADRD and their care partners."
10846853,"Summary
Idiopathic aplastic anemia (AA) is characterized by immune-mediated hematopoietic stem and
progenitor cells (HSPCs) destruction resulting in deficiencies across all hematopoietic lineages
and bone marrow failure. Despite of the therapeutic successes of immunosuppressive therapies
(IST), approximately one third of patients remain refractory and many of the responses are
incomplete. Recently, a synthetic thrombopoietin receptor (TPOR) agonist, Epag has been shown
to be effective in AA. In addition to the anticipated effect on platelet counts, Epag also produced
remarkable tri-lineage hematopoiesis. These effects expanded the indication spectrum of Epag
from immune thrombocytopenic purpura to AA, establishing this drug as an essential hematologic
therapeutic. Recent studies demonstrate that Epag’s hematopoietic activity is also observed in
murine models despite the lack of binding to murine TpoR. We confirmed similar effects in murine
cells where Epag treatment remarkably expanded HSCs without any effect on the TpoR signaling.
These observations suggested that a significant part of Epag’s activities are TPOR independent,
in contrast to peptide TPO analogs, e.g., romiplostin. These TPOR independent effects of Epag
were hypothesized to be due to its iron chelating properties, but the molecular mechanism as to
how this iron-binding could drive the HSPCs expansion remains speculative. Epag effects on
intracellular iron may affect certain iron-dependent epigenetic pathway/s that promote
HSPCs self-replication. For instance, TET-dioxygenases (TET1-3) are Fe2+- and α-
ketoglutarate (αKG) dependent DNA-dioxygenases, which mediate CpG demethylation
of promoters and enhancers in HSPCs. Consequently, by changing gene expression
patterns, TETs control HSPCs expansion and differentiation. TET2 is the most abundant
TET-dioxygenase in HSPCs, and somatic loss-of-function (LOF) mutations of this gene
frequently occur in myeloid neoplasia and clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential
(CHIP), a prodromal condition in otherwise healthy elderly individuals characterized by
high progression rate to a frank leukemia. Our proposal is designed to determine the
effects of Epag on normal hematopoiesis mediated by its ability to inhibit TET-activity.
Based on our analysis of clinical data coupled with biochemical analysis we hypothesize that,
Epag-mediated TET- inhibition is responsible for tri-lineage response in AA via HSC expansion
and on the biochemical level decreased 5hmC content leading to hypermethylation as a result of
direct inhibition of TET2. Our current proposal will provide a proof of concept for the reversible
transient TET-inhibition as a basis for HSC expansion that may restore normal hematopoiesis."

10823566,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This F31 project aims to close gaps in knowledge that could inform vaccine policy and facilitate implementation
of maternal influenza vaccines in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Influenza causes 3-5 million cases
of severe illnesses and 290,000-650,000 deaths globally each year. Pregnant people are at increased risk of
influenza morbidity and mortality, making vaccination a high priority in this population to protect themselves, their
fetuses, as well as their infants via maternal antibodies. Although influenza mortality rates are estimated to be
higher in LMICs, empiric data on the influenza disease burden are limited. In addition, the impact of maternal
influenza vaccination on infant growth has not been evaluated while accounting for bias induced by undefined
infant growth outcomes due to fetal or early infant death. Best practices for implementing maternal immunization
programs have also not been established including the optimal timing of vaccination. Moreover, potential costs
must be considered since LMIC health budgets often need to prioritize which interventions to implement due to
resource constraints. The proposed F31 research project leverages data collected between 2011-2014 as part
of a maternal influenza vaccine RCT in Sarlahi District, Nepal (NCT01034254) among pregnant people (18-40
years) and their infants who were followed through 6-months postpartum. The parent study included enrollment
visits, weekly household-based active surveillance for respiratory pathogens, illness surveys on symptoms and
care seeking behaviors, maternal/infant birth assessments, monthly maternal comorbidity assessments, and
infant anthropometry visits at birth and 6 months to measure weight (g), length (cm), and head circumference
(cm). Using log-binomial regression methods, Aim 1 will assess the impact of influenza vaccination during
pregnancy on maternal influenza disease severity among pregnant participants (n=3693). Aim 2 will characterize
the effect of maternal influenza vaccination on infant z-scores at birth and 6 months of age accounting for
outcomes truncated by death among all singleton births using multinomial logistic regression (n=3520). Aim 3
will evaluate the optimal timing and cost-effectiveness of administering seasonal influenza vaccine during
pregnancy using an existing decision tree model to project the potential impact of maternal influenza vaccine
timing strategies (second versus third trimester compared to no vaccination) and calculate incremental cost-
effectiveness ratios. Data generated from this project will expand the current maternal influenza vaccine
evidence base in LMICs, which may motivate changes in vaccine policy, implementation, and investment
decisions. As a long-term goal, the F31 study team seeks to contribute to reducing disparities in global influenza
vaccine access so that all communities can benefit from this critical public health intervention. This research plan
will provide the F31 candidate rigorous predoctoral training including (1) performing advanced analyses in
infectious disease epidemiology; (2) developing content-area expertise in maternal immunization; (3) acquiring
methods to evaluate vaccine cost-effectiveness; and (4) gaining further experience in research dissemination."
10823927,"Self-renewal is the process by which a cell divides to generate daughter cells that have the same
developmental potential as the parent cell. The overall goal of our collaborative research project is to gain a
mechanistic understanding of erythroid progenitor (EP) self-renewal, both in vitro and in vivo. Red blood cells
(RBCs) make up more than 80% of all cells in the human body, but have a limited lifespan, necessitating a
massively expansive and exquisitely responsive production system. This production is regulated predominantly
at the late progenitor phase of erythropoiesis, since downstream erythroid precursors undergo a fixed number
of maturational cell divisions. In vitro, erythroid progenitor self-renewal is limited, which is a major stumbling
block to production of specialized units of blood. The Palis lab discovered that erythroblasts derived from the
yolk sac of murine embryos were capable of essentially unlimited self-renewal. These cells had increased
expression of the Polychrome Repressive Complex (PRC1) members Bmi1 and Ring1b, as well as cholesterol
metabolism genes. Importantly, overexpression of BMI1, a chromatin modulator normally expressed in
erythroid progenitors, can also expand human erythroid cells in vitro, termed BMI1-induced self-renewing
erythroblasts (iSREs). Collaborative studies with the Steiner lab provide evidence that BMI1 alters the self-
renewal capacity of human erythroblasts both through known (e.g., Ink/Arf locus), and novel (e.g., cholesterol
homeostasis) pathways. Our data further suggest that BMI alters the activity of RING1B, which
monoubiquitinates histone H2A lysine 119, and also has essential roles in regulating higher order chromatin
interactions. In Aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that BMI1/Ring1b regulate human SRE self-renewal through
epigenetic control of transcription and cholesterol homeostasis. Expansion of erythroid progenitors is essential
to maintain steady state erythropoiesis and for the response to acute anemic or hypoxic stress. In preliminary
studies we have defined 4 progressive stages of murine erythroid progenitors, termed EP1 to EP4, analogous
to those recently defined in humans, and determined that late-stage EP3/4 progenitors preferentially expand in
the marrow of mice in response to acute anemia. In Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that Bmi1/Ring1b and its
downstream targets regulate the expansion of late-stage (EP3/EP4) erythroid progenitors both at steady-state
and in response to acute anemia. Together, these studies will provide mechanistic understanding of erythroid
progenitor self-renewal and bring a renewable source of human erythroblasts closer to the clinic to meet
specialized transfusion needs."
10824067,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
There is no doubt that the complex lipid makeup of the membrane bilayer and the associated peripheral
membrane proteins dictate integral membrane protein (IMP) structure, function, localization, and dynamics in
vivo. Yet, all this is replaced with detergents in traditional in vitro studies of IMPs due to technological limits.
Indeed, the rapidly advancing G protein-coupled receptor and ion channel fields are showing us that both
tightly bound and loosely-associated membrane lipids play crucial roles in defining receptor behavior. Current
structural understanding of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) seems extensive; however, we lack the
fundamental knowledge of how RTKs are regulated by and transmit signals though the plasma membrane.
Recent data have revealed this as a major shortcoming, as lipid-like antidepressants are thought to bind and
modulate tropomyosin receptor kinase B and to quell aberrant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
signaling in glioblastoma (by altering sphingolipid metabolism). EGFR, is an RTK that plays crucial roles in
cellular and lipid metabolism, differentiation, motility, and proliferation in cancer. EGFR is a member of the
ErbB family which has an extracellular-ligand binding domain linked to its intracellular kinase signaling domain.
Monomeric EGFR is canonically regarded as inactive and ligand binding activates the receptor by driving
formation of an asymmetric kinase dimer; both the active and inactive states are associated with different lipid
microenvironments. Numerous structures have shown how individual RTK domains function in isolation and
full-length EGFR (FL-EGFR) studies have revealed only another ectodomain structure due to being performed
in a non-native membrane environment, omitting crucial lipid-cofactors. Ideally, one would study (FL-EGFR) in
the context of the appropriate endogenous plasma membrane environment. However, the necessity to replace
the bilayer with detergent during membrane protein isolation has made this historically impossible. To address
this, I will combine newly available key technologies to define in vivo membrane protein environments and
investigate lipid co-factor impacts on FL-EGFR structure and function. Aim 1 seeks to understand how the
bilayer environment controls EGFR function with kinetic assays of FL-EGFR in defined lipid compositions
will be used to understand the enzymatic influence of literature-identified lipid co-factors. Lipid compositions
that significantly alter EGFR’s enzymatic properties will then be used to develop a comprehensive “real”
structural study. The results in artificial bilayer systems will be validated with FL-EGFR in native nanodiscs
which allow for study of membrane proteins along with their native lipid environment. Aim 2 asks what are the
bilayer environments of EGFR? Numerous studies propose EGFR to reside in multiple poorly-defined bilayer
environments: one in the ligand-bound active dimer state, and another in the inactive monomer state. Native
nanodiscs and mass spectrometry-based lipidomics will characterize and compare the membrane and protein
compositions in these two distinct environments."
10824157,"Abstract:
Most cancer-related deaths are a consequence of metastatic disease. Yet, our understanding of the underlying
mechanisms responsible for metastasis—especially the immune system's role in modulating metastatic
progression—remains rudimentary. My sponsor’s lab recently discovered that tumor invasion into lymph nodes
(LNs) evokes the induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs) that confers systemic, tumor-specific immune tolerance,
thereby permitting distant (organ) metastases. While both human and murine tumor-involved lymph node tissues
have demonstrated a conserved and dominant mechanism requiring Tregs for metastatic progression, the
underlying mediator that governs their development remains enigmatic, and thus, warrants further investigation.
In line with the notion that professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) are critical for antigen-specific T cell
development, my preliminary work revealed that professional APCs are differentially enriched in tumor-involved
lymph nodes of mice. However, which APC population is responsible for promoting tumor-specific Treg
development, and whether the tumor immune tolerance machinery can be therapeutically overcome remains to
be investigated. To address these gaps in knowledge, I propose the following aims: 1) identify the APCs that
potentiate LN metastasis-induced tumor-specific immune tolerance; and 2) assess therapeutic strategies that
reprogram APCs to curtail metastatic progression. Using high-dimensional multiplexed imaging (CODEX),
single-cell RNA-sequencing, various in vivo cell-depletion mouse models and adoptive cell transfer assays, as
well as in vitro co-culture experiments, I will systematically dissect the key APC population that I hypothesize is
responsible for mediating tumor-specific Treg development. To therapeutically reprogram the APCs away from
tolerance induction, I will develop immunostimulatory antibody conjugates that drain into LNs and test them in
mouse models of melanoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The proposed work aims to delineate the
APC population that is responsible for mediating tumor-specific Treg induction and to advance the development
of immunotherapeutic strategies to treat metastatic disease."

 The proposed research focuses on the unique needs of Black young adults aged 18-26 years to address a
critical gap in the research and clinical care. The goal is to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a
culturally adapted and tailored intervention to enhance diabetes management strategies among Black young
adults with T1D, addressing the pervasive racial disparity in health outcomes for this population. OnTrack is a
tested intervention that demonstrated improved outcomes (diabetes distress and HbA1c) among adults (mean
age 45.1 years, SD=15.0) with T1D and elevated HbA1c. It involves highly structured, group-based sessions
(facilitated by a counselor) and individual support. OnTrack had greater reductions in diabetes distress among
patients with lower cognitive function or emotion regulation, higher distress, and higher diabetes knowledge at
baseline. Though these baseline metrics among KPGA patients are unknown, formative work highlighting
feelings of isolation, stress, and challenges with self-management render OnTrack an ideal starting place for
patients with T1D. While OnTrack improved outcomes in T1D, its relevance to Black young adults has not
been tested. More representative and culturally competent interventions are needed.
 This proposal leverages the team's expertise in developing interventions35, KP's capacity to access our
virtual data warehouse to gather historical and prospective data, KPGA's proportionately large Black patient
advisory board and membership with T1D, and clinical advisors from endocrinology, health education, and
behavioral health. The specific aims for the 3-year study are to:
Aim 1: Assess feasibility of the culturally tailored intervention T1DES by measuring intervention acceptability,
demand (retention, completed > 80% of sessions), practicality, and implementation fidelity through participant
surveys and key informant interviews with participants and the health care delivery team.
Aim 2: Evaluate the effect of the T1DES intervention on diabetes outcomes in a pilot randomized clinical trial
among N=40 Black young adults age 18-26 years with T1D and elevated HbA1c (>7.5%) by comparing
changes in HbA1c, diabetes distress, and self-management from baseline to 6-months post-baseline among
participants randomized to T1DES compared to the diabetes education-only control condition. We hypothesize
T1DES participants will demonstrate improved HbA1c, reduced diabetes distress, and increased self-
management over time compared to controls. Results will be used to generate effect sizes and support an
application for larger, fully powered, longer term trial to evaluate the impact of T1DES on health outcomes and
disparities. More research is critically needed on effective strategies that are both inclusive of Black young
adults and tailored to their unique challenges.24 Our goal is to provide diabetes education and emotion
regulation support tailored for Black young adults' experiences that will result in sustained glycemic control and
can be incorporated into adult endocrinology practices."
10823508,"In many countries risky drinking is common. Worldwide more than 5.1% of the overall global health burden is
associated with alcohol misuse and this percentage is rising. Most of the time, harmful drinking is temporary,
but over the course of a lifetime, 15-20% of the entire U.S. population will have a more chronic problem, some
even diagnosed with an alcohol use disorder (AUD). Many are not aware or deny their drinking is a problem,
and most individuals need help to reduce their alcohol consumption to safe levels.
Acute alcohol is commonly by breathalyzer or blood ethanol tests; however, these tests could only detect
alcohol within hours after consumption. For chronic alcohol use and abuse, long-term alcohol biomarkers are
needed. There are several direct alcohol biomarkers in use but it is generally agreed that phosphatidylethanol
(PEth) is the most reliable long-term alcohol biomarker currently known. After alcohol ingestion, PEth remains
in red blood cells (RBC) up to 30 days or longer. PEth is currently measured by mass spectrometry, but the
turnaround time is slow (>1 week) and the cost is high. Echelon Biosciences recently developed PEth ELISA
for research use only which significantly lowered the cost and turnaround time. The improvement was
significant, but due to the nature of PEth incorporated in RBC membranes, an extraction step is needed before
ELISA detection.
The goal of this Phase I project is to demonstrate feasibility of a prototype rapid point-of-care PEth competitive
lateral flow immunoassay (POC-LFI). Echelon has partnered with an LFI expert, Dr. Richard Watt at Brigham
Young University, to improve the consistency, sensitivity, and preanalytical methods to create an in vitro PEth
LFI approaching 10 ng/mL for abstinence monitoring, and ex vivo methods for whole-blood clinical detection of
PEth at concentrations ≥ 200 ng/mL to detect excessive alcohol consumption.
The success of this project will fulfill an unmet need in the alcohol testing market. There are multiple settings
and application for POC testing including AUD assessment, workplace security, assessing alcohol exposure in
neonates, forensic/legal cases, and importantly help clinicians and caregivers identify problem drinking and
help these individuals receive the treatments they need."

The midbrain dopamine system plays a crucial role in various brain functions such as learning, motivation, and
movement, and its dysregulation has been linked to various disorders such as addiction, mood disorders and
Parkinson’s disease. A significant amount of evidence suggests that the activity of dopamine neurons in the
ventral tegmental area (VTA) resembles a temporal difference (TD) reward prediction error (RPE) signal, which
is the discrepancy between predicted and actual rewards, particularly, in those dopamine neurons projecting to
the ventral striatum (VS). However, how the activity of dopamine neurons, particularly the RPE-related activity,
is generated remains not fully understood. By combining new molecular, genetic, and electrophysiological
tools, this project aims to uncover how neural circuits compute RPE-like responses. Aim 1 will examine the
roles of glutamate inputs to dopamine neurons in the generation of dopamine responses. The overall pattern of
glutamate inputs to dopamine neurons will be assessed using genetically-encoded glutamate sensors. The
hypotheses to be tested is that glutamate and GABA inputs to dopamine neurons act synergistically to produce
dopamine RPE signals, but compete to shape dopamine responses to aversive events. Aim 2 will create
anatomical and functional maps of cell type-specific presynaptic neurons to dopamine neurons. Input neurons
for dopamine neurons are distributed across many brain regions throughout the brain. Understanding the
specific information transmitted from each region is crucial to comprehend how dopamine responses are
generated. A novel method using a modified rabies virus will be applied to perform cell type-specific labeling of
input neurons to projection-specific dopamine neurons. Using these tools, an anatomical map of glutamate and
GABA inputs to dopamine neurons projecting to the VS will be created. Then electrophysiology and fiber
photometry will be used to characterize functional activities of these input neurons during behavior. Their roles
in the regulation of dopamine activity will then be tested by manipulating the activity of the major inputs. Aim 3
aims to elucidate the mechanism of dopamine-dependent incremental development of dopamine cue
responses. Optogenetically-induced local dopamine release will be paired with sensory cues to elucidate the
mechanisms underlying the development of dopamine cue responses. The preliminary results have indicated
that local dopamine release in the VS, but not in the dorsal striatum, causes the development of dopamine cue
responses broadly across the striatum. The hypothesis to be tested is that dopamine responses as well as
value-related activity in the striatum gradually shift in time between cue and optogenetic dopamine activation,
as predicted by TD learning models. Further, how this learning modulates the activity of neurons in VS and
other brain regions will be examined. This Aim will clarify the neural mechanism through which dopamine
responses dynamically change by learning, and reveal not only the mechanisms modulating dopamine activity,
but also the mechanism of TD learning itself."

Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by the irreversible breakdown of cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM).
Current regenerative strategies cannot fully restore the biomechanical functions of cartilage, as they do not
fully recapitulate the collagen fibrillar architecture of native ECM. This project will study the activities of the
regulatory fibril-forming type III collagen (collagen III) in directing cartilage matrix assembly and chondrocyte
mechanotransduction at different stages of post-natal growth, maintenance and disease. Our central
hypothesis is that collagen III regulates cartilage ECM biomechanics and chondrocyte mechanotransduction
through its effects on collagen fibril assembly and integrin switching, and that loss of collagen III increases
cartilage susceptibility to OA.
Specifically, we will elucidate the activities of collagen III in the formation and maintenance of cartilage (Aim 1),
in injury-induced cartilage degradation in OA (Aim 2), as well as in the neo-matrix assembly and chondrocyte
mechanotransduction (Aim 3). In Aim 1, we will determine if loss of collagen III impairs ECM fibril assembly,
pericellular matrix (PCM) integrity, chondrocyte mechanosensing and gene expression during the post-natal
growth and aging. In Aim 2, we will first determine if loss of collagen III accelerates cartilage degeneration and
OA progression in post-traumatic OA induced by the following destabilization of the medial meniscus surgery
(DMM model). We will then determine if collagen III delays the degradation of collagen II and aggrecan in
response to inflammatory factors known to drive OA progression. In Aim 3, we will first determine if collagen III
regulates the assembly of neo-matrix synthesized by chondrocytes cultured in 3D hydrogel under the
stimulation of dynamic loading. Next, we will delineate the effects of collagen III on regulating the integrin
switching of chondrocytes and downstream mechanosensitive pathways, with a focus on integrin α11. To
elucidate the role of collagen III in cartilage, a number of innovative approaches will be used. We generated a
novel inducible collagen III deficient (i.e., Col3a1F/+, Col3a1F/F) mouse model to study the dose-dependent
effects of collagen III by temporal targeting of collagen III in cartilage. We will apply a multidisciplinary analysis
paradigm that integrates atomic force microscopy (AFM)-nanomechanical tests, immunofluorescence imaging
and laser capture microdissection. These techniques will enable us to study the impact of collagen III on
cartilage composition, structure, mechanics and cell mechanotransduction, and to determine mechanisms by
which it regulates matrix remodeling and mechanosensation. Successful completion of this study will establish
collagen III as an essential constituent responsible for ECM structural integrity and cell mechanotransduction of
cartilage. Outcomes will provide a new basis for improving cartilage tissue engineering using collagen III-based
biomaterials and elucidate new collagen III-dependent mechanisms to serve as targets for OA intervention."

 This project will constitute human research characterizing the microbiome and endocannabinoid system
(ECS) in people with HIV (PWH) and how they relate to neuroinflammation and blood-brain barrier (BBB)
function. Based on exciting new preliminary findings described here, we propose that alterations in the gut
microbiota (dysbiosis) and impaired gut barrier integrity (leaky gut) are mediators between the ECS and
neuroinflammation and BBB dysfunction in HIV. Our major goals are to (1) characterize the gut microbiota and
ECS in response to exogenous cannabinoid exposure in both PWH and people without HIV (PWoH); (2)
characterize patterns of HIV-associated inflammation (innate, adaptive, T-cell, B-cell) in blood and cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) in response to controlled cannabis exposure; (3) assess effects of cannabinoid exposure on these
patterns and how they are mediated through changes in the ECS, gut microbiota and gut barrier function. We
will perform a clinical trial of 50 PWH and 50 PWoH exposed in a randomized, cross-over fashion to 14 days
each of oral THC and CBD to determine if treatment with either phytocannabinoid reduces inflammation and
improves gut function. The experimental approach will use fecal shogun metagenomic sequencing to
characterize the gut microbiome, with particular attention to aerotolerant bacteria, pro-inflammatory species,
Prevotella spp., Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides spp. and butyrate-producing bacteria. We will evaluate how
the microbiota and leaky gut relate to neuroinflammation and impaired BBB function, the latter potentially leading
to increased CNS exposure to microbially-produced pro-inflammatory ligands. The rationale for the study is that
virologic suppression on antiretroviral therapy (ART) does not normalize gut lymphoid tissue CD4+ T cell
depletion, leaky gut, dysbiosis, chronic gut inflammation, and microbial antigen translocation (MAT). These
alterations ultimately drive systemic and CNS inflammation. Compromised gut barrier function due to altered
tight junctions, apoptosis and reduced epithelial cell proliferation and repair render PWH susceptible to increased
tissue exposure to pro-inflammatory ligands produced by gut microbiota and are important in HIV
neuropathogenesis. Of particular relevance here are recent findings that the ECS in the large intestine interacts
with the gut microbiota to regulate epithelial barrier permeability. Thus constituents of cannabis, acting through
the gut EC system, may be therapeutic, and the existing literature suggests that the two principal constituents of
cannabis, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), have differential effects on the ECS."

NRG Oncology (hereafter NRG), a member of the NCI-supported National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN),
was created in 2014 through the merger of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project
(NSABP), the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG), and the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG).
These three National Cancer Institute (NCI)-supported legacy cancer cooperative groups had over 150
years cumulative experience in the conduct of practice-defining, multi-institutional, Phase II and III practice
changing clinical cancer trials. Since its inception, NRG has made significant progress toward its goal of
improving the duration and quality of lives of adults with specific non-hematologic malignancies through the
conduct of its clinical research. Its specifically defined patient populations of interest, those with gender-
specific malignancies, and/or those with localized or locally advanced disease, are unique within the NCTN,
constituting a large and relatively under-investigated cohort of cancer patients. Underpinning these activities
has been the NRG Oncology Biospecimen Bank (hereafter NRG-BB) that has since 2015 received,
processed, annotated and stored 259,415 biospecimens from over 14,356 patients enrolled on 103 phase
I, II and III adult NCTN and NCORP trials. These biospecimens have been used for integral, integrated,
and exploratory translational science to answer a range of key questions in cancer directly leading to 82
highly influential and practice changing publications. NRG Oncology plans to enroll up to 3,183 patients per
year in future NCI-funded NRG and NCORP sponsored cancer clinical trials. For use in trial-related
activities and future translational science projects the NRG-BB will collect, process and manage
biospecimens from patients enrolled in Phase II & III clinical treatment trials to maintain an accurate and
effective repository of tumor and normal tissues with associated clinical, epidemiologic, and descriptive
biospecimen information. The NRG-BB will maximize the quality and quantity of biospecimens and their
derivatives through the utilization of standardized and optimal preservation, storage, quality assurance and
distribution methods. We will market and distribute de-identified samples in a standardized and equitable
manner to all qualified investigators both within and outside NRG Oncology by continue to work closely with
the NCTN Navigator and ""front door"" services. Working with the biobanks from other NCTN groups and the
Group Banking Committee of the NCI, we will continue to harmonize biospecimen activities and processes.
Finally, we will capitalize on our distributed infrastructure to support and/or perform innovative genomic
analyses for patient assignment to multi-arm targeted therapy trials conducted by NRG Oncology. Robust
informatics is required to allow translational scientists to know what is available within the NRG-BB and to
equitably distribute biospecimens to the translational science community both within and outside NRG
Oncology. We have implemented a robust and integrated specimen Tracking and Reporting System
(STARS) bioinformatics platform across our three NRG-BB performance sites. This common IT platform
across the 3 biospecimen bank sites has permitted an improved service level for the group, interoperability
and freely exchangeable data with our NRG-BB partners and opportunities to enhance our links with the
SDMC. Moreover, this new platform has permitted better external linkages with the Group Banking
Committee, the NCI and with the Navigator and Front Door project.
Relevance:
The collection, management and distribution of high quality and well annotated biospecimens associated
with NRG clinical trials data will lead to translational studies for validating biomarkers of tumor prognosis
and prediction of response to therapy, ultimately leading to improved treatment of cancer patients. These
activities will support improved quality of biospecimens, and expanded access for translational scientists,
thus leading to better quality research and identifying appropriate patients for personalized approaches to
improved cancer care."

This R01 grant focuses on neurotrophic mechanisms involved in stimulant- or opioid-induced plasticity in the
nucleus accumbens (NAc) and other reward-related brain regions. A particular focus has been the molecular
basis by which these drugs of abuse alter the density and morphology of dendritic spines elaborated by NAc
medium spiny neurons (MSNs). Four key questions are addressed in this competitive renewal application.
First, virtually all molecular mechanisms implicated in mediating cocaine-induced spine growth affect thin
spines only, with little insight available into the delayed growth of mushroom spines seen after prolonged
withdrawal from cocaine self-administration (SA) and associated with relapse. Recent work supported by this
grant has uncovered the involvement of RAP1B and microtubule-associated proteins in controlling mushroom
spines on NAc MSNs, and these novel pathways will be further delineated in male and female mice in the
proposed research. Second, there is very little information available concerning whether the time-dependent
effects of cocaine SA on NAc dendritic spines occur in D1-type or D2-type MSNs. We have optimized a
method to enable this analysis such that the effects RAP1B and microtubules will be studied in a cell type-
specific manner. However, we know that MSNs are far more heterogeneous: a subset of MSNs express D1
and D2 receptors, and single cell RNA sequencing reveals considerably more heterogeneity. In the proposed
studies, we will embrace this complexity by characterizing cocaine’s effects on NAc MSNs by use of single cell
technology. We will also identify the small subset of MSNs that are activated during the life cycle of cocaine SA
by use of Arc-CreER2 mice, which make it possible to tag cells activated in response to one stimulus (e.g., first
cocaine exposure) and track how those cells respond over time during drug SA. Characterizing dendritic spine
regulation in these distinct subsets of MSNs is a high priority. Third, several forebrain regions send excitatory
inputs to NAc MSNs, which contribute to distinct aspects of addiction-related behaviors, but much less is
known about the cellular heterogeneity within those afferent regions, and how the distinct subsets of neurons
are affected by drugs of abuse. Recent findings revealed distinct subsets of ventral hippocampal (vHIP)
pyramidal neurons that express either D1 or D2 dopamine receptors, suggesting a parallel level of cellular
organization as elaborated for NAc. We have confirmed these findings and found further that such D1 vs. D2
vHIP neurons, both of which innervate the NAc, exert opposite effects on cocaine relapse behavior. This grant
offers the perfect venue in which to provide initial characterization of these cell types in addiction. Fourth, much
less is known about the effects of opioids on NAc spine plasticity, a major gap in knowledge which we propose
to fill through the course of the proposed studies. Together, this work will contribute to an improved
understanding of the molecular, cellular, and circuit basis of addiction-related behavioral abnormalities, and
provide new pathways forward in identifying target genes suitable for future drug discovery efforts."
10813033,"Project Summary/Abstract
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects >80 million people in the United States and is implicated in
up 36% of liver-related deaths. While NAFLD is the fastest-growing cause of cirrhosis and liver-related
complications, not all patients with NAFLD ultimately develop cirrhosis. Our ability to identify which patients
are at highest risk is limited, which makes it challenging to allocate intensive lifestyle intervention and
pharmacologic therapy to those at highest risk. The strongest predictor of incident cirrhosis is fibrosis stage,
but existing fibrosis only identifies patients who have already progressed toward cirrhosis and requires
advanced phenotyping such as biopsy or transient elastography which are not universally available. It will be
critical to develop improved models for disease progression. This project focuses on two factors which may
improve risk stratification of progression to cirrhosis: genetics and machine learning using electronic medical
record (EMR) data. Heritability of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis is as high as 50%, and a number of genetic
variants have been linked to risk of cirrhosis. The EMR is a rich but complex source of data used in clinical
practice. When constructing models with such high-dimensional data, non-linear effects and interactions
between predictors are common; machine learning algorithms may outperform the more commonly-used
logistic regression models in this respect. The overall goal of this project is to generate predictive models for
which patients with NAFLD are most likely to progress to cirrhosis by integrating genetics and EMR-based
predictors with machine learning. The specific aims are (1) characterizing the effect of genetic risk factors on
rate of progression from NAFLD to cirrhosis, (2) training and validating machine learning models for incident
cirrhosis based on EMR data, and (3) generating integrated models incorporating both EMR and genetic data.
To accomplish these aims, Dr. Chen will obtain further training in processing of EMR data, the fundamentals
of statistical genetics, and machine learning and predictive modeling. Dr. Chen’s long-term goal is to become a
leading, independent investigator generating models to predict outcomes in NAFLD and eventually even
prioritize patients for treatment accordingly. An NIDDK K08 award will provide Dr. Chen with the necessary
time and training to achieve his career goals and improve care for patients with NAFLD. Overall, this project
will improve ability to predict which patients with NAFLD are most likely to develop cirrhosis and therefore
enhance precision health by helping medical providers prioritize persons at highest risk to more intensive
intervention."
10811003,"Abstract/Summary
The goal of this application is to further develop a first-in-class therapeutic regimen that attenuates
aging of human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Aging of hematopoiesis in older adults often
manifests as aging-associated anemia, progressive reduction in the immune response, and/or
increased incidence of myeloid malignancy. These aging associated declines are in part attributed to
the aging of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and hematopoietic system that sustain our life-long
production of quality red blood cells, immune cells and white blood cells. Previous studies have
established, mostly in murine models, that elevated Cdc42 activity and loss of cell polarity serve as
aging associated biomarkers for HSCs and targeting Cdc42 activity via a lead small molecule Cdc42-
activity specific inhibitor, CASIN, can dose-dependently suppress elevated Cdc42 activity and loss of
polarity of aged animals to functionally rejuvenate or attenuate aging of murine HSCs. CASIN thus has
the potential to be further developed towards clinical applications to benefit human aging. The central
hypothesis of this proposal is that targeting Cdc42 activity with the drug CASIN can restored Cdc42-
regulated polarity and rejuvenate aged human HSCs ex vivo, which will benefit bone marrow HSC
transplant patients. The proposed studies will develop the proof-of-principle of an intervention to
rejuvenate aged blood forming system and validate CASIN in rejuvenating aged human HSC epigenetic
clock and function at well-defined ex vivo conditions. The proposal will also test a clinically applicable
closed circuit HSC manipulation apparatus for CASIN ex vivo treatment in future commercialization of
this technology. Upon completion of the proposed studies, we expect our product will move closer to
FDA IND filing and clinical trials in preventing or treating aging related functional decline of human
blood system to benefit the lives of older adults."

10808578,"Coxiella burnetii is an intracellular bacterial pathogen that causes human Q fever. Q fever presents
most often as an acute flu-like illness but can present as fatal chronic endocarditis. Unfortunately,
treatment options for Q fever endocarditis are highly ineffective and require many months of antibiotic
administration. We recently discovered numerous host-directed drugs that suppress C. burnetii
replication within the pathogen’s target cell, the human macrophage. These drugs, which are typically
used to treat psychosis- or mood-related disorders by inhibiting neurotransmitter (NTM) system
signaling, potentially represent novel anti-Q fever therapies. The current proposal will define the
impact of NTM-acting drugs on the ability of C. burnetii to replicate within alveolar macrophages
and regulate the macrophage innate immune response to infection. Aim 1 will define the specific
NTM machinery involved in C. burnetii replication in macrophages. Aim 2 will define the impact of
host-directed drugs on the pathogen’s ability to dampen the cytokine response and shift alveolar
macrophages to a pro-replication, anti-inflammatory phenotype. Throughout the proposal, we will use
primary human alveolar macrophages and human precision-cut lung slices to provide disease
relevance. Collectively, the current proposal will lay the groundwork to characterize novel anti-C.
burnetii treatments."
10808400,"Herpes simplex virus (HSV) establishes a lifelong latent infection of neurons, periodically reactivating to
produce infectious virus. Reactivation can cause keratitis and lesions on the body surface. Furthermore,
substantial data link HSV to the progression of Alzheimer's disease, highlighting the need to develop
therapeutics to prevent HSV reactivation. However, little is known about the mechanisms regulating the
induction of viral gene expression following a reactivation stimulus. Previous studies from our lab and others
have shown that HSV reactivation is biphasic, with an initial synchronous burst of viral gene expression,
referred to as Phase I or animation because it is unique to the reactivation process. Viral gene expression
during Phase I/animation is independent of viral DNA replication and requires the host cell stress protein, DLK.
When initially discovered, Phase I/animation was also thought not to require HSV lytic proteins. However, our
lab has found that at least one viral protein, UL12.5, is required to promote expression of additional viral genes
during Phase I, suggesting that the process of animation is more complex than previously thought. However,
unlike the events during HSV lytic replication, the timing of viral gene expression and promoters used during
Phase I/animation have not been elucidated. Therefore, the goals of this project are to map HSV lytic gene
expression during animation and determine the contributions of DLK and UL12.5 to ultimately promoting Phase
I gene expression. The only known function of UL12.5 is to induce mitochondrial nucleic acid release and
subsequent activation of innate immune sensing pathways involving STING and/or MAVS. Intriguingly, we
have found that direct activation of STING can induce HSV to reactivate from a latent infection. Therefore,
based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that UL12.5 is expressed early during animation to hijack innate
sensing pathways and promote Phase I viral lytic gene expression. In aim 1), we will map at high resolution the
lytic transcriptional units expressed during animation and the contribution of the only known host (DLK) and
viral (UL12.5) factors important for Phase I gene expression. In aim 2), we will test the hypothesis that HSV
hijacks innate sensing pathways for Phase I gene expression. This proposal is significant and innovative
because we will create the first high-resolution map of HSV lytic gene expression following a reactivation
stimulus, facilitating future investigation into the role of viral genes and host proteins in promoting exit from
latency. In addition, we will determine the contribution of the first viral protein identified that is required for HSV
Phase I gene expression. Inhibiting UL12.5 expression or its downstream mechanism of action could prevent
entry into reactivation and, therefore, limit potential detrimental effects of UL12.5 or additional viral proteins that
could ultimately promote neuronal degeneration."

Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment and is a cornerstone of standard clinical practice and
ongoing clinical trials. However, some immunotherapies including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) impart
adverse cardiac events ranging from arrhythmias to fulminant myocarditis. While the mechanistic basis for
adverse cardiac events from cancer therapies targeting immune checkpoints is not known, recent evidence
suggests that macrophage infiltration and aberrant T-cell activation may be contributing factors.
Ligand-receptor interactions between antigen presenting cells (APCs) and T-cells comprise current targets for
immunotherapy. When used in combination with ICIs, CD40 agonists increase efficacy against previously
untreatable tumors. CD40 signaling mediates activation of macrophages to heighten downstream T-cell
responses. CD40 is primarily expressed on APCs such as macrophages, and its ligand is expressed on T-
cells. Little is known regarding how CD40 agonists impact the heart including the potential for adverse cardiac
events. The principal investigator (PI) has established that CD40 agonist treatment activates an inflammatory
response in the heart that may lead to injury. In this proposal, the PI will test the hypothesis that CD40
signaling alters the immune landscape of the heart, priming the inflammatory response to myocardial injury.
The scientific goals of this proposal are focused on identifying mechanisms of cardiac injury and remodeling as
a result of cancer immunotherapies that regulate immune checkpoints, which may be targeted to improve
clinical outcomes. The PI plans to investigate the immune cell target(s) of CD40 signaling (Aim 1), the key
regulators and mechanism of signaling (Aim 2), and the effect the inflammatory response has on cardiac
remodeling (Aim 3). Completion of these aims will allow the PI to gain technical expertise in flow cytometry,
single cell sequencing, immune functional assays, and evaluation of cardiac injury and cancer models.
The career development goals of this proposal are focused on developing the PI into an independent physician
scientist in the field of cardiovascular research. The PI is an MD/PhD with advanced training in basic and
translational cardiovascular research during his post-doctoral fellowship and has completed clinical training in
Internal Medicine, Cardiovascular Diseases, and Cardio-Oncology. Within the next 5 years, the PI plans to: 1)
develop collaborative relationships with his mentoring committee; 2) develop core and advanced competencies
in bioinformatics with a focus on single cell sequencing analysis, and in immunology with a focus on cardiac
immunology and immunotherapies; 3) strengthen grant writing, manuscript preparation, data presentation, and
mentoring skills. At the conclusion of this mentored clinical scientist training proposal, the PI will have acquired
mentorship, technical, didactic, and professional development training to become an independent and
successful physician scientist."

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is an important contributor to maternal and neonatal
morbidity and mortality in pregnancy. Approximately 1 in 8 pregnancies is impacted by GDM
worldwide. Despite adverse intergenerational outcomes associated with GDM, this condition is
not detected sufficiently early in regular obstetrics practice. Professional societies recommend
screening for GDM; however, guidance is inconsistent and late in pregnancy, thus precluding
meaningful time to intervene for maternal-offspring benefit. A clinical predictive model that
combines clinical risk factors and simple serum biomarkers has shown clinical promise due to
its excellent discriminatory ability but has lacked clinical implementation. Therefore, the goal of
the proposed research is to: 1) develop an implementation protocol and 2) test the feasibility
and acceptability of a first trimester screening protocol for the early detection of GDM. We will
conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial among 80 high-risk pregnant women in the first
trimester. Participants will be randomized to protocolized early GDM screening with serum
biomarkers before 14 weeks gestation or to standard of care (i.e., early screening with
additional screening between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation). The proposed K23 award will build
on my background in obstetric research focused on diabetes and high-risk pregnancy
management. This award will allow me to achieve my training goals: 1) obtain advanced training
in statical methods and clinical research methods related to clinical trial design, 2) gain
knowledge surrounding mixed methods assessment, 3) develop expertise in executing real-
world trials with implementation science methods to test and sustain interventions in obstetric
populations, and 4) enhance leadership and academic writing skills to become a successful
clinical scientist. Additionally, this award will contribute to my long-term goal of becoming an
independent physician-scientist focused on improving the perinatal care of women and their
children who develop diabetes during pregnancy. My multidisciplinary mentoring team, and the
supportive research environment at the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School,
provide the necessary support for me to achieve my training and research goals. This award will
set the stage for a future R01 application to conduct a large scale, multi-site randomized
controlled trial assessing the widespread implementation and effectiveness of our early diabetes
screening protocol compared with current care standards."
10800091,"Over 95 percent of maternal and child deaths globally occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)
where reliable death registries are mostly unavailable and other dependable data are scarce. Moreover, within
LMICs, the most disadvantaged and remote communities tend to have the highest mortality rates but the least
reliable data. Knowledge on the state of maternal and child health (MCH) in LMICs relies mostly on household
surveys. These expensive and time-consuming surveys cover merely a small minority (usually <2%) of all
communities in a country and are (at best) carried out only every couple of years. We propose a new approach
to measuring MCH indicators that would provide up-to-date estimates at a very high geographic resolution and
at little to no cost. Specifically, we hypothesize that machine learning in geotagged “big data” sources, with a
key source being satellite imagery, can accurately estimate critical MCH indicators for each village and
neighborhood in a country. Satellite imagery is a key data source in this project because it is updated
frequently (at least monthly), covers all areas of a country, and is available free of charge. We will pursue three
specific aims: 1) determining whether machine learning in satellite imagery and other publicly available
geotagged data can accurately estimate key indicators of MCH status in a village or neighborhood at a
snapshot in time and longitudinally over time; 2) determining whether this approach can also accurately
estimate coverage with critical MCH services at a snapshot in time and over time; and 3) achieving sufficient
interpretability of our machine learning models to inform on data needed to improve predictions, which
interventions to target where, and generalizability. The approach to achieving our aims is to use household
surveys that are geocoded at the village and neighborhood level as the “ground truth” against which we will
train machine learning models in satellite images and publicly available geotagged data. Our extensive
preliminary data, along with high-impact publications (e.g., in Science and Nature) by our team on using
satellite images to predict important determinants of MCH in LMICs (such as community-level poverty, surface
water quality, water and sanitation infrastructure, crop yields, travel time to the nearest healthcare facility, and
air pollution), demonstrate that this approach is feasible. Crucially, our predictions will improve over time as the
size and quality (e.g., the resolution of satellite imagery) of our data continue to increase. In addition to a
unique dataset as well as open-access code for our machine learning models, this project will provide maps
with an extremely high geographic resolution of key MCH indicators to inform policymakers and researchers on
the current state of MCH. This project is significant because it can inform the geographically precise planning
and targeting of MCH interventions, may enable the evaluation of past interventions and policies, and can
serve as a blueprint for extending a “precision public health” approach to health outcomes beyond MCH."

Cardiac pacemaker cells (CPCs) rhythmically initiate the electrical impulses that stimulate heart contraction. CPC
dysfunction co-segregates with a broad variety of both cardiac and non-cardiac disease conditions and represents the
leading cause for the surgical implantation of artificial pacemakers. Moreover, CPC dysfunction is a leading cause of
sudden death among heart failure patients. Despite clinical burden of CPC dysfunction, very little is currently known
regarding the cellular pathologies that disrupt normal pacemaking. Indeed, we lack even a basic understanding of the
cellular and environmental conditions required for CPC homeostasis. Over the previous funding period, work conducted
within this R01 has uncovered a novel paradigm demonstrating that CPCs require low cellular strain to maintain the
cytoarchitectural features necessary for their function. Thus, the focus of this renewal application is to define the molecular
pathways that produce a microenvironmental niche around CPCs that functionally minimizes cellular strain. Importantly,
our preliminary data now demonstrate that CPCs express unique classes of paracrine factors which specifically activate
their local interstitial support cells. This activation drives the formation of a biomechanically compliant extracellular matrix
that surrounds and encapsulates CPCs (protecting them from contractile and hemodynamic forces present throughout
the rest of the heart). We have also identified that ectopically increasing cellular strain results in breakdown of CPC activity
and the loss of paracrine activation of their local interstitial cells. Collectively, these data have led to the hypothesis that a
mechano-paracrine positive feedback loop co-regulates the behavior of CPCs and their support cells patterning the local
tissue mechanics required for CPC activity. We will test this by defining the specific molecular pathways that integrate
mechanical feedback within CPC (Aim1), identifying the paracrine factors that maintain CPC-interstitial cell crosstalk
(Aim2), and determining how CPC-interstitial interactions changes under conditions of aging or pathological cardiac
remodeling (Aim3). Thus, successful execution of this proposal will create a novel and holistic model of CPC homeostasis
that accounts for the cooperative activity of multiple cell types within the sinoatrial node. We project these studies will
establish fundamental principles that define CPC developmental optimization, inform our overall understanding of CPC-
related disease progression, and instruct tissue engineering approaches designed to generate biological pacing systems
for therapeutic purposes."
10800360,"Abstract
 An estimated 400,000 anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries occur yearly in the United States. Most ACL
injuries are non-contact, occurring during rapid deceleration movements such as jumping and cutting.
Importantly, the risk of early-onset osteoarthritis (OA) persists regardless of whether ACL reconstruction is
performed. Therefore, identifying risk factors for non-contact ACL injury is of great clinical importance.
 The function of the ACL is to resist tibiofemoral motion during the intense forces associated with dynamic
activity. Therefore, measuring the dynamic elongation patterns of the ACL functional bundles will provide imaging
biomarkers of elevated tension within the ACL. As the ACL fails under tension, factors associated with elevated
ACL bundle elongations reflect increased vulnerability to injury.
 Non-contact ACL injuries are 2-6x more likely in females as compared to males. Patients with prior ACL
injury are up to 15x more likely to sustain injury to their uninjured contralateral knee than uninjured controls.
Finally, while controversial, some studies indicate that fatigue increases injury risk. However, there remains
limited in vivo data to describe ACL bundle elongations during relevant dynamic activities (such as jumping and
cutting) in these groups. Because different studies suggest that different motion patterns are associated with
non-contact ACL injury, the kinematic risk factors for this injury remain unclear. Additionally, studies suggest that
a number of characteristics of femoral, tibial, and ACL morphology are related to injury risk. However, it remains
unclear how these kinematic and morphologic factors interact to influence ACL tension during relevant dynamic
activities. Thus, quantifying the influence of these factors on in vivo ACL bundle elongations in these high risk
groups addresses a critical barrier to our understanding of what elevates ACL injury risk.
 Thus, we propose to utilize a novel in vivo multimodal imaging methodology developed by our lab to assess
the impact of 6DoF kinematics and characteristics of knee morphology on in vivo ACL bundle elongations
(defined as change in length normalized to an unloaded reference length). These relationships will be assessed
during jumping and cutting activities in three potentially high risk populations. Specifically, we will investigate
these relationships Aim 1.) in both sexes, Aim 2.) in the uninjured knees of patients with prior ACL injury and
control knees, and Aim 3.) pre- and post-fatigue. Relevant biological variables including sex, age, BMI, race,
isokinetic muscle strength, sport participation, and activity level, will also be considered as covariates that may
impact ACL bundle elongations. Furthermore, interactions between covariates will be explored to assess
differential effects of one covariate across levels of another. Thus, the proposed studies will have high impact
because they will 1.) address a fundamental gap in knowledge regarding the causes of ACL injury 2.) identify
those who are at high risk for injury and 3.) identify those who are best targeted for intervention strategies."

Mixed pathologies of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) represent the most
common cause of dementia in the elderly population. The presence of SVD exacerbates the progression of
AD. Multiple sex-specific AD risk factors contribute to a heightened SVD-related AD risk in women. With its
potent estrogenic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects, Equol has beneficial effects on cerebral blood
vessels. Therefore, leveraging the ongoing NIA-funded multi-site ""Arterial Stiffness, Cognition, and Equol

associated neurochemical substrates (Aim 1) and to determine the role of Equol in improving cerebrovascular
health (Aim 2). The proposed 7T-ACE study takes advantage of ultra-high field 7T vascular and molecular

characterizes blood-brain barrier (BBB) function, small vessel morphology, white matter microstructure, and
white matter hyperintensities (WMH). Specifically, with advances in 7T time-of-flight MR angiography (TOF-
MRA) and susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) and with our newly developed and validated VesselMapper
and BrainVein methods, we are able to characterize the morphological features of small arteries and small
veins. Our 7T molecular MR imaging using the state-of-the-art whole-brain magnetic resonance
spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) measures brain metabolites associated with cerebrovascular aging, including N-
acetylaspartate (NAA) and glutamate (Glu) (markers of neuronal integrity) and myo-inositol (mI) (a marker of
glial cells and inflammation). Compared to WMH (a conventional marker of SVD), these novel morphological
and molecular markers reflect specific, early, mild, and reversible damage and thus are particularly important
in developing therapeutic targets for disease prevention and treatment. Recently, brain age (BA) models have
been developed using machine learning algorithms to predict age from T1-weighted MR images. These
models primarily fit gray matter atrophy patterns (referred to as GM-BA) and lack discrimination regarding
white matter, where vascular changes are prominent. Using these GM-BA models, women are consistently
found to be 1.5-3.5 years younger than men. This obviously does not align with the epidemiologic findings that
women are disproportionately affected by AD, suggesting that GM-BA models alone are not sufficient to
characterize brain aging. Therefore, besides GM-BA models, a white matter brain age (WM-BA) model trained
with WM microstructural features is proposed in this study to characterize cerebral white matter aging process.
The proposed 7T-ACE study will characterize effects of sex and Equol treatment on cerebrovascular aging and
associated neurochemical profiles. The proposed study will also identify primary factors contributing to these
effects. Understanding sex- and Equol-related effects on cerebrovascular aging and cognition will guide a sex-
specific precision treatment strategy in AD prevention."

The Hearing Loss Association of America (HLAA) is the nation's largest organization representing people with
hearing loss. The HLAA Convention, held annually, draws a broad national audience and is key to achieving
HLAA's mission ""to open the world of communication to people with hearing loss by providing information,
education, support and advocacy."" Since 1994, each HLAA Convention has featured a Research Symposium
that covers cutting-edge scientific topics relevant to adults with hearing loss. These symposia are distinctive
because they are geared toward educating the hearing loss public about research. Often this is information
that people with hearing loss cannot get anywhere else. However, many members of the HLAA community
lack the time and resources to attend the convention. HLAA seeks a renewal of NIDCD support to continue to
bring the Research Symposia to a broader audience, by producing high-quality captioned/ASL interpreted
videos of the symposium talks and disseminating them. We aim to (1) Organize and present a Research
Symposium at each HLAA convention, featuring a panel of top-tier scientists and clinicians, using presentation
formats that are accessible to attendees and others with hearing loss; (2) Harness multimedia and other
approaches to offer the content of the Research Symposia to those who cannot attend the HLAA Convention in
person, including HLAA members, people with hearing loss and their families, and the general public, and (3)
Improve hearing loss research by promoting engagement and dialogue between scientists and the hearing loss
community. Although most R13 applications are submitted by scientists and scientific or professional
organizations seeking to engage with fellow scientists, this application is innovative in that it is submitted by a
robust and engaged patient organization that seeks to disseminate information about scientific research to its
members and the wider public."

Periodontitis (gum disease) is a ubiquitous chronic inflammatory, bacteria-triggered oral disorder affecting two-thirds of Americans over age 65. If left untreated, it leads to severe destruction of the periodontal attachment apparatus, eventually resulting in tooth loss. There are no approaches for predictably regenerating defects with severe bone loss and avoiding tooth extraction. Thus, there is an emerging quest for personalized solutions that can guide coordinated growth and development of the periodontal attachment apparatus. We hypothesize that: (1) Melt ElectroWriting (MEW) is the fabrication tool required to develop a compositionally and structurally tailored, tissue-specific scaffold to hearten bone growth and PDL formation on root surfaces with moderate adjacent bone; and (2) the convergence of MEW with ceramic printing is key to engineering a compositionally graded and structurally tailored scaffold to support bone growth while guiding PDL formation on root surfaces with minimum adjacent bone. Two aims are proposed. Aim 1 will optimize a personalized, compositionally and structurally tailored, tissue-specific polymeric scaffold to regenerate defects with moderate surrounding bone. Aim 2 will develop a personalized, compositionally graded and structurally tailored, tissue-specific multi-material scaffold to regenerate defects with minimum surrounding bone. To expedite translation, we will determine efficacy using our clinically relevant animal models. Successful completion of this project is central to translating personalized therapies to treat tissue destruction caused by periodontitis and thus saving millions of teeth from extraction."

Emerging microbiota-gut-brain axis research demonstrates an important role of gut microbes in the
establishment and treatment of nervous system disorders, including depression. An estimated 300 million or
nearly 4% of the human population suffers from depression globally. Depression is a complex multifactorial
disease and recent epidemiological studies indicate that antibiotic treatment predisposes humans to the
development of neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression. One proposed mechanism is that antibiotic
administration alters gut microbiome structure and function as well as hinders gut-brain communication through
decreased synthesis of neuroactive compounds. However, the mechanisms by which antibiotics induce
depression remain unclear. In this K01 award proposal, I propose to use a novel nonhuman primate model, the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), to investigate the mechanisms by which antibiotics induce depression.
Marmosets serve as a powerful model due to their human-like similarity in physiological and behavioral sequelae.
My specific aims are as follows: 1. Characterize changes in gut microbiome structure and function as well as
behavior in marmosets following antibiotic treatment, 2. Evaluate the additive effect of antibiotic treatment and
social separation on induction of depressive symptomatology in marmosets, and 3. Evaluate the therapeutic
effect of fecal microbiota transplantation on treatment of depression in antibiotic-induced dysbiotic marmosets. I
plan to administer a broad-spectrum antibiotic cocktail (with and without additional stressors) and study changes
in behavior, immune profiles, neuroendocrine hormone levels, gut microbiome structure and function and gut
bacterial metabolites. I also plan to study the role of fecal microbiota transplantation in reversing behavioral,
physiological and microbiological changes in marmosets administered antibiotics and compare its efficacy to
fluoxetine (a commonly prescribed antidepressant). The results from this research will generate novel
hypotheses, serve as critical preliminary data necessary to compete for competitive extramural funding, and
represent the first step towards establishing the common marmoset as a translational model for studying effects
of antibiotic use on microbiome modulation and the development of depression. I have also established a training
plan and mentorship team to gain critical skills in neurobiology, metabolomics and multi-omics data analysis. My
long term goal is to become a leader in microbiota-gut-brain axis research and to establish marmosets as an
animal model to study the role of gut-brain axis communication in neuropsychiatric disorders."
10821069,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Problem: Lung cancer is the third most common cancer in the US, with an estimated 238,340 new cases in
2023, and is projected to be about 2.5 times more deadly than any other cancer type in 2023 (127,070 deaths).
The 5-year survival rate for advanced metastatic lung cancer is only 7%. There is a huge unmet medical need
for treatment of patients that are resistant or refractory to targeted therapies or recently approved immune check
point inhibitors. There is very strong evidence that higher levels of soluble MICA and MICB cleaved from the
cancer cell surface led to immune escape and directly correlated with a poor patient survival rate. Therefore,
designing an antibody-based therapy that blocks MICA/B cleavage presents an attractive therapeutic
opportunity. Technology: Aakha Biologics is developing a novel first-in-class MICA X MSLN bispecific antibody
for the treatment of advanced metastatic lung cancer that is resistant or refractory to current treatment options.
The MICA X MSLN bispecific antibody combines three crucial components into a single agent, bringing synergy
in NK cell activation: (I) an anti-α3 domain-specific MICA/B binding arm to block proteolytic cleavage of MICA/B
and restore immune surveillance by re-engaging MICA/B (via the α1 and α2 MICA domains) with NKG2D, (II) an
engineered Fc variant to enhance ADCC activity compared to WT Fc, and (III) an anti-MSLN binding arm to
enhance specificity and efficacy. Aakha Biologics has identified an ADCC enhanced Fc engineered lead anti-
MICA antibody (AHA-1031) that prevents shedding of MICA/B. We demonstrated that our Fc engineered
antibody dramatically slows and inhibits tumor growth compared to the benchmark CLN-619 antibody that is in
a Phase 1 clinical trial. To further boost efficacy and specificity, we constructed a tool bispecific antibody that
comprises our lead anti-MICA Fab arm as the immune activating arm, an anti-MSLN sdAb (from the literature)
as the TAA arm, and an enhanced ADCC Fc variant. As expected, we observed much higher specific cell killing
for the bispecific antibody compared to the monoclonal parent antibody. With this knowledge, we now plan to
assemble our own ADCC-enhanced bispecific MICA X MSLN antibody. The goal of the current proposal is to
screen and identify the best bispecific antibody that demonstrates superior tumor growth inhibition in multiple
NSCLC mouse tumor models compared to benchmark antibodies. Successful completion of the proposed
studies will support a Phase II SBIR application and help us complete a portion of the IND-enabling studies. Our
final goal is to take this bispecific antibody into clinical trials and potentially provide improved treatment options
for patients with advanced NSCLC."

Project Summary
Our understanding of how human adaptive immune responses are initiated, evolve over time, and become
durable have been shaped largely, although not exclusively, by what we have learned from measuring B and T
cells in the blood following immune perturbations with pathogens, vaccines and immune-modulating drugs. While
longitudinal analyses can be performed with blood samples, it is only possible to assess the recirculating immune
cells and we know that many antigen-experienced “memory” B and T cells rarely recirculate and reside in
peripheral and lymphoid tissues. Recent studies in animals reveal that immune memory cells in tissues play
important early roles in immune protection at barrier sites. The generation and maintenance of these cells are
controlled by different mechanisms and these tissue-residing memory cells are endowed with distinct phenotypic,
molecular, and functional programs. Although it is difficult to study human tissue-residing immune cells, the
elegant studies that have been done confirm that studying immune cells in tissues reveals additional complexity
that is not always captured in peripheral blood. However, to date, most human studies in peripheral tissues have
not evaluated the evolution or durability of antigen specific B and T cell responses in the face of a continuously
changing microenvironment and/or ongoing antigen exposure. This gap in knowledge limits our ability to
identify appropriate modalities to boost and maintain protective immune cells within peripheral tissues and to
prevent the development and persistence of potentially pathogenic immune cells that contribute to tissue
damage. This U19 addresses the knowledge gap by characterizing immune memory cells that reside in tissue
samples derived from transplant patients. The unifying goals of the three U19 projects are to better understand
the evolution of human immune memory responses in tissue and blood and to characterize the factors that
contribute to the persistence and durability of human memory T and B cells. To meet these goals, investigators
with complementary expertise in B and T cell biology, infectious disease, transplantation and autoimmunity will
work together to methodically interrogate the memory B and T cell compartments in transplanted kidney, uterus
and lung. The major objective of Core A is to provide financial, scientific and regulatory oversight and
administrative support for the overall Program as well as the individual projects and cores. We will achieve this
objective by: (i) supporting the scientific progress of the projects and cores, organizing the monthly research in
progress meetings and interfacing with the project and core team members to ensure needs are met; (ii)
organizing scientific interactions such as the annual retreat with the scientific advisory board, and the annual
Cooperative Centers on Human Immunology investigator meeting; (iii) providing financial oversight and
administrative support to the Program; and (iv) organizing the keynote lecturer at the annual UAB Immunology
Institute Vaccine Symposium. The Administrative Core team members will ensure that the components operate

 Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) is a retrovirus that infects CD4+ T cells of the immune
system. If left untreated, HIV-1 infected individuals will progress to AIDS and may ultimately die as a result.
Combination antiretroviral therapy is extremely effective at stopping the replication of HIV-1 in infected
individuals. Despite the success of this therapy at suppressing HIV-1 replication to clinically undetectable
levels, antiretroviral therapy is not curative. This is due to the persistence of HIV-1 in a silent, or latent, state
within a subset of CD4+ T cells known as resting memory CD4+ T cells. In this latent state, these infected cells
are not targeted by antiretroviral drugs and cannot be eliminated by the immune system. In HIV-1 infected
individuals, latently infected CD4+ T cells are found at extremely low frequencies (~1 per million resting
memory CD4+ T cells), with the majority found within immune tissues at any given time. This population of
latently infected cells is very stable, demanding that HIV-1 infected individuals remain on antiretroviral therapy
indefinitely to avoid rebound of viremia. As such, this population of latently infected CD4+ T cells is the main
barrier to curing HIV-1 infection.
 Developing strategies to eliminate latently infected cells is a major focus of the NIH, NIAID, and the
HIV-1 research field. To demonstrate the efficacy of therapeutics targeting the latent reservoir, we must be
able to measure the frequency of latently infected cells using rapid and accurate assays that can be scaled for
widespread clinical use in both peripheral blood and immune tissues. Accelevir Diagnostics, LLC is therefore
developing an NIAID resource to perform three innovative molecular assays to accurately measure the size of
the latent reservoir, the amount of residual viremia present in the peripheral blood, and the transcriptional
activity of persistent proviruses. Broadly, this proposal will provide funding to support performance of these
assays for the HIV-1 cure research community in a centralized location using standard operating procedures
for both laboratory research and clinical trials."

Down syndrome (DS), or trisomy 21, is the most common chromosomal disorder in newborns (about 1 in every
700 babies in the United States). Associated with numerous impairments, the cognitive deficits constitute one of
the most notable features in DS, having problems with learning, memory, and speech/language throughout life.
Abnormal brain development in DS begins in utero. It is critical to be aware of an altered initial brain anatomy in
DS for better predicting what aspects of brain function will likely preferentially/precociously deteriorate, which
would allow for potentially earlier/better prevention and treatment. A comprehensive knowledge of the early
morphological/fiber pathway development in DS is still lacking. An earlier phase of this project was funded as an
R21. This retrospective study, based on routine clinical MRI, successfully identified early brain abnormalities in
DS. The Brodmann’s Area 3b (primary somatosensory) in the parietal lobe showed abnormally increased
cortical thickness/volume, starting from birth in DS, which could explain sensory perceptual deficits. In contrast,
abnormal measures in the temporal lobe (superior temporal gyrus; language function) were not found at birth
but became significant with age. Our findings suggest that our approach has a great potential for identifying
common early MRI-based brain malformations in DS. In addition, our data showed decreased pathways
between the VZ/SVZ and the temporal lobe in DS infants, suggesting that our HARDI tractography could be
useful for detecting early fiber abnormalities, including postnatal migration streams, in regions where
morphological measures tend to miss early signs of pathology. In this proposal, we plan to confirm these
findings using ex vivo MRI with significantly higher spatial resolution as well as polarization sensitive optical
coherence tomography (PSOCT) which provides micron-level spatial resolution.

10799340,"Project Summary
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common and burdensome psychiatric disorder. Unfortunately, current
depression treatments suffer from numerous weaknesses, including treatment-resistance in a large proportion
of patients. Several factors likely contribute to the limitations of current MDD pharmacotherapies, including the
heterogeneous nature of depression symptoms and the fact that most conventional treatments were
discovered serendipitously rather than by targeting the underlying mechanisms of the disorder. One reason
why targeted treatments have not been developed for MDD is the lack of translation between the depression-
relevant behaviors quantifiable in humans relative to those used to model MDD. Unfortunately, many
behavioral models used to test new medications for MDD are often based on phenomena will limited relevance
to those seen in humans, meaning that treatments targeting those behaviors often have limited clinical efficacy.
As an alternative to those existing models, specific tests quantify impairments exhibited by people with
depression that are also available for testing in rodents. Here, we propose an approach that leverages the
clinical sensitivities of behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) assessments to better evaluate the
putative impact of depression-relevant manipulations. Given the heterogeneous origins of MDD, Aim 1 will
test whether three distinct manipulations known to induce depression-relevant behaviors (chronic
corticosterone treatment, a short-active winter-like photoperiod, and acute treatment with the
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine) are capable of inducing depression-relevant states in mice,
using cross-species behavioral readouts affected in people with MDD, the probabilistic reversal learning and
progressive ratio breakpoint tasks. Because depression can also alter neurological processes independent of
its behavioral impacts, Aim 2 will test whether the same three manipulations have effects on specific
behavioral-associated neural processes that are known to be impacted in MDD that can be directly
tested in rodents (Reward Positivity and parietal alpha power). Finally, to test the ability of these models to
detect novel treatment efficacy, Aim 3 will determine the impact on these models of classical psychedelic
drugs such as psilocybin (currently undergoing human trials for MDD) that produce long-lasting symptom
reductions after acute administration. To disentangle the potential therapeutic-like effects of psychedelics from
their intoxicating properties, the psychedelics will be tested at doses equivalent to high and low (micro)doses in
humans. Overall, we will develop translational depression-relevant models that target specific domains of
performance impacted in people and assessable in mice, potentially enabling the discovery and development
of new, mechanistically-targeted treatments for MDD. Given our use of psychedelics in current clinical trials
and use of these EEG-linked tasks in clinical populations, these data will enable targeted assessment in
patient populations in future studies."

Arthritis-related conditions occur in over 1 in 5 adults, and the prevalence is increasing. Current approaches
to modulate endogenous inflammatory mediators in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) predispose patients to

10825518,"Infection following bony fracture is one of the most prevalent and challenging complications in trauma patients
with an estimated annual cost of $35 billion in the US. (https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/11550)
Recurrent infection rates are unacceptably high at 30%, resulting in prolonged morbidity, loss of function,
and/or loss of limb. Vascular perfusion plays a critical role in the health of bone by delivering necessary
oxygen, nutrients, antibiotics, and endogenous immune cells. The management of bony infection is therefore
based on aggressive, thorough debridement in an effort to remove all poorly perfused bone through visual and
tactile clues such as color, turgor and extent of soft tissue stripping. However, there are no objectively
measurable or quantifiable methods to assess the bone perfusion and the success of removing devitalized
bone is based almost entirely on surgeon’s experience. Thus, the overall goal of this proposal is to develop
and evaluate an indocyanine green (ICG)-based dynamic contrast-enhanced fluorescence imaging (DCE-FI)
to objectively assess bone perfusion and guide surgical debridement. The scientific premise of this proposal
is underpinned by data from our prior pre-clinical work in a porcine model and our pilot clinical study
applying ICG-based DCE-FI to assess bone perfusion in patients during orthopaedic surgery. In these
studies, we established that DCE-FI can quantitatively assess bone perfusion in a measurable, reproducible
and predictable manner, and we developed analytic models differentiating the endosteal from periosteal
contribution to total blood supply. This model was then able to effectively differentiate healthy from damaged
bone with a linear decision boundary with 89% accuracy, in the pre-clinical porcine study. To attain our overall
objective, three aims will be pursued. In Aim 1 we will assess the relationship between post-debridement bone
perfusion, as measured using ICG-based DCE-FI, and recurrent infection/treatment failure. Additionally, we
will refine analytic models that assess the relative contribution of endosteal versus periosteal blood
supplies. In Aim 2 we will explore the relationship between dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) and
DCE-FI to improve the three-dimensional analytic potential of DCE-FI. In Aim 3 we will develop streamlined
analytic tools into a user-centered interface that will optimize use of ICG-based DCE-FI derived data in
normal surgical workflow. Application of ICG-based DCE-FI has enormous potential to revolutionize
treatment of post-traumatic infections by minimizing treatment failure and minimizing bone resection
and ultimately revolutionize the standard of care for millions of trauma patients. This project leverages an
extensive infrastructure and experience in fluorescence-guided surgery as well as longstanding collaborations
between surgical subspecialties and biomedical engineers at Dartmouth and R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma
Center."

Inborn errors of immunity (IEI) are genetic disorders of the immune system that can manifest with a wide variety
of presentations, including susceptibility to infection, lymphoproliferation, autoimmunity, and malignancy.
Investigating IEI is critical not only to develop targeted molecular therapies for patients, but also to enhance our
understanding of the human immune system. Indeed, fundamental advances of the human immune response
have stemmed from studying patients with IEI. The long-term goal of this research is to investigate genetic
mechanisms of novel IEI to enhance our understanding of the human immune system and improve patient care
through the application of targeted molecular therapies. Here we propose to investigate patients with an
autosomal dominant antibody deficiency and defect in memory B cells. These patients suffer from recurrent and
severe infections due to an inability to mount appropriate antibody responses. Our preliminary studies have
identified a defect in B cell maturation associated with increased proliferation. In Aim 1 of this application we will
test B cell signaling and in vitro maturation in an effort to pinpoint important pathways that are altered and
disease-causing. In Aim 2 of this application we focus on a genomic finding of a region of duplicated DNA with
overexpression of a gene that we hypothesize leads to the altered B cell phenotype. We will use genomic and
genome engineering approaches to better define this genetic change and determine whether it is responsible for
disease in these patients. Results from these studies have the potential to molecularly define a new IEI and

10785883,"This proposal posits that phthalates, which are widely considered endocrine disrupting chemicals, interfere with
human telomere biology in utero, leading to shortening of telomeres in the placenta and newborn. Specifically,
it is hypothesized that phthalates alter the activity of telomerase through actions on hTERT, which encodes the
catalytic subunit of the enzyme. As telomere length (TL) is largely determined at birth, prenatal exposure to
phthalates could reset one’s lifelong TL trajectory with potential health effects during adulthood. Southern
blotting (SB) and the Telomeres Shortest Length Assay (TeSLA) will be used to examine associations between
prenatal phthalate exposure and TL parameters measured in the placenta-newborn unit. The placenta will
further be leveraged to gain a mechanistic understanding of molecular outcomes related to phthalate exposure.
This will be achieved by quantifying hTERT expression, telomerase activity, formation of telomere dysfunction-
induced DNA damage foci (TIF), activation of cell cycle checkpoints and senescence markers in tandem with
measuring TL parameters. TL measurements in umbilical cord blood and follow-up blood at approximately age
8 years will serve to test whether a putative phthalate effect on TL persists through the first decade of life.
Generating longitudinal TL data will not only provide insight into the endurance of the phthalate effect, but will
also fill a critical knowledge gap about early life TL dynamics. This research will leverage existing prenatal
phthalate data and biobanked perinatal biospecimens (placenta and cord blood) from 500 mother-child pairs
enrolled in the prospective New York University Children’s Health and Environment Study (NYU CHES). The
proposal benefits from the strong collaboration between W. Cowell (Contact PI), an environmental and
molecular epidemiologist with over 10 years of experience working with birth cohorts and A. Aviv (Co-PI), an
expert in telomere biology. Knowledge gained can provide a foundation for the use of TL at birth as a
biomarker of future health risk. TL measurements may thus become a precision tool that help gauge early risk
for later life TL-linked diseases."

 Subthalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) can significantly improve the motor symptoms and quality of life
of patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Recent advances in DBS technology are providing new
opportunities to interrogate and characterize the pathophysiology of PD using local field potential (LFP)
recordings. Previous LFP investigations brought to light the important role of beta-band (12-30 Hz) activity in
PD. However, we are still faced with a wide range of questions on the biophysics of subthalamic LFPs. For
example, How many subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons need to be synchronized to generate a clinically
measurable LFP signal? What are the synaptic input characteristics responsible for that synchronization?
Where are those neurons located in the STN? The McIntyre lab has spent the last decade developing the
computational infrastructure to address these questions within the context of the human STN implanted with
clinical DBS electrodes. Therefore, we propose the integration of those advanced modeling tools with ongoing
human studies (directional STN LFP recordings – Dr. Walker, and chronic STN LFP recordings – Dr. Bronte-
Stewart) that are defining the clinical cutting edge of DBS LFP studies.
 The goal of this Bioengineering Research Grant (PAR-19-158) is to apply the latest advances in patient-
specific LFP modeling to the analysis of directional STN recordings and chronic STN recordings in PD patients.
These analyses will allow us to address fundamental questions on the size and location of synchronous neural
populations in the STN, which have important implications for understanding the pathophysiology of PD. In
addition, our models will enable us to evaluate the variance in STN neural synchrony across populations of
patients, and over long periods of time within the same patient, both of which have important implications for
the engineering design of LFP-based DBS algorithms. The first step of this project will focus on evolving the
patient-specific LFP modeling infrastructure to accommodate directional DBS electrodes and adapt to different
electrode positions in each patient-specific STN volume. The second step of this project will use the patient-
specific LFP model system to identify the size and location of beta synchrony in 10 PD patients using
directional DBS recordings acquired during intra-operative experiments. Finally, we will quantify the
modulation of the size and location of the beta synchrony in 5 PD patients using chronic LFP recordings and
measurements taken at 4 different time points over a 1 year period."

working memory). Notably, levels of impairment in executive functioning within HD are highly heterogenous
and the specific underlying mechanisms driving declines are not well understood. Evidence from seminal
reviews and longitudinal empirical studies (e.g., Slavich & Irwin, 2014; Zainal & Newman, 2022), have
identified chronic stress and inflammation as two important mechanisms that contribute to executive
functioning deficits in other populations. However, little to no research has investigated how stress and
inflammatory mechanisms may be contributing to declines in executive functioning in HD. The proposed study
will fill this gap in the literature by examining the contribution of chronic stress, inflammation, and disease
processes to impairments in executive functioning in a sample of adults with HD. The proposed study will
leverage access to participants in an ongoing NIH grant (R01HD104188; m-PI’s: Compas & Claassen) testing
the longitudinal associations among social connectedness and health behaviors in HD patients and their
families as compared to a community sample of families. The primary goals of the proposed study are three-
fold. First, this study will improve the quality of the measurement of stress in individuals with HD by adapting
and using state-of the art methodology (i.e., stress interviews with a blind rating component) to assess general
and disease specific stressful events in a sample of individuals with HD compared to a community sample of
adults. It is hypothesized that individuals with HD will exhibit a greater number of general acute and chronic
stressful events on average compared to a community sample of adults. Further, variability in disease specific
acute and chronic stress within the HD sample will be associated with relevant demographic and disease
characteristics (e.g., disease progression). Second, the proposed study will investigate two candidate
mechanisms, chronic stress and CAG by Age Product (CAP) scores (a standardized marker of disease
burden; Warner et al., 2022) that may contribute to heightened inflammatory processes in a HD sample. Lastly,
direct and indirect path analyses will examine associations of stress, inflammatory cytokines, and CAP scores
with impairments in executive functioning in a sample of individuals with HD. Because the proposed is
embedded within a larger, longitudinal grant, a portion of analyses for the final aim will be tested both cross-
sectionally and prospectively at 6-month follow-up. Training for the applicant will include development of new
skills with biological methods (i.e., inflammatory cytokine assays), data management and analyses, along with
an opportunity to expand knowledge on the biological underpinnings of stress and disease processes on an
important indicator of functioning, executive function. Finally, evidence from this proposal yields potential
important ramifications on treatment and intervention targets for supportive care in this population."
10824146,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a high mortality condition in which the lung epithelium
is unable to mount its usual regenerative response to injury. Despite promising preclinical data
showing that cell-based therapy, primarily adoptive transfer of mesenchymal stromal cells, can promote epithelial
regeneration in acute lung injury, the mechanism behind these findings is unclear, and thus they have not been
successful in clinical trials. Currently, there are no mechanism specific treatments for ARDS, even though the
COVID-19 pandemic has increased the urgency of the need for ARDS treatments to tackle ongoing and future
respiratory pandemics.
In this proposal, we aim to develop cell-based therapy using a mechanistic approach with the goal of delivering
growth factors that promote alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) proliferation to the injured lung. We will use engineering
principles from the CAR T cell field and combine them with knowledge from in vitro and in vivo studies of lung
epithelial injury response to develop a potent new model for delivering therapeutics. Hepatocyte growth factor
(Hgf) and keratinocyte growth factor (Kgf) are known to stimulate AEC proliferation and protection from lung
injury in mouse models and hence we will initially focus on delivering these growth factors as therapeutics.
First, we will evaluate in vitro how to best design “sender” engineered T cells to secrete sufficient concentrations
of growth factors to activate downstream signaling pathways in “receiver” cell lines or primary lung epithelial
cells. Next, we will use mouse models of lung injury to compare delivery of intravenous recombinant Hgf and Kgf
vs delivery of these factors via adoptive transfer of T cells. We will then confirm in vitro and in vivo that we can
engineer synthetic notch receptors that activate an engineered transcriptional output (“payload”) when they bind
to lung epithelium specific surface markers. The surface markers we have selected are membrane GFP
expressed specifically on surfactant protein C expressing type 2 AECs (from an SFTPC-CreERT2; H11-lsl-
mGFP mouse), Ager, expressed on mouse and human type I AECs, and Slc34a2, expressed on mouse and
human type 2 AECs. Finally, we will combine these two systems to engineer T cells that deliver their “payload,”
in this case Hgf or Kgf, only when they contact an AEC, thus activating the AEC specific synthetic notch receptor
(AEC-SynNotch). We expect that we will see an increase in AEC proliferation after lung injury with adoptive
transfer of these AEC-SynNotch-Hgf or AEC-SynNotch-Kgf cells and that we will also see improvements in
physiologic and histologic measures of lung injury.
The completion of this project will generate data that will provide a clearer understanding of how mechanistically
engineered cell-based delivery of a growth factor compares to delivery of the same therapeutic in IV recombinant
form. Our long-term plan is to apply these design principles to cells already being used in ARDS clinical trials
(mesenchymal stromal cells and regulatory T cells) to improve efficacy, which will represent a new paradigm for
designing cell-based therapies to deliver genetically encoded therapeutics to specific tissues."
10823738,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Diabetes is characterized by the loss of functional pancreatic β-cell mass. With the prevalence of diabetes
increasing across the globe, it is crucial that we develop a complete understanding of the gene regulatory
mechanisms governing the maintenance of insulin-producing β-cell identity and function. In our previous work,
we demonstrated that the Isl1 transcription factor and its histone-modifying co-regulators Rnf20 and Rnf40 are
crucial for β-cell gene expression. Recently, we observed that in mice, β-cell-specific loss of Rnf20 (Rnf20Δβ-cell)
prompts a disruption of glucose homeostasis, loss of β-cell identity gene expression, and an upregulation of cell
cycle inhibitor mRNA, p19Arf. In aging human and mouse β-cells, cell cycle inhibitors encoded by Cdkn2a,
p19Arf and p16Ink4a, are upregulated and impart a reduction in functional capacity known as senescence. While
suppression of the age-associated upregulation in Cdkn2a expression is known to reverse β-cell senescence,
the transcriptional mechanisms that repress Cdkn2a in healthy β-cells are understudied. In this proposal, I will
investigate the regulatory relationship between Rnf20 and Cdkn2a to assess whether Rnf20 mediates β-cell
senescence. My primary hypothesis is that Rnf20 protects against senescence-associated loss of β-cell
functional identity through direct regulation of the Cdkn2a locus. I will address this hypothesis with two aims. In
Aim 1, I will evaluate how the β-cell specific loss of Rnf20 affects the β-cell cycle and the appearance of the
senescence-associated secretory phenotype. I will also perform systemic senolytic treatment to determine if
targeted elimination of senescent cells rescues the glucose intolerance and reduced plasma insulin levels that
occur in Rnf20Δβ-cell mice. In Aim 2, I will determine whether Rnf20 regulates the transcription of Cdkn2a. I will
perform Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to assess if Rnf20 directly occupies the Cdkn2a promoter and
ATAC-seq to see if loss of Rnf20 increases Cdkn2a chromatin accessibility. Our results will increase
understanding of the transcriptional mechanisms regulating both the maintenance of β-cell identity and the
process of β-cell senescence. Additionally, our outcomes may be used to inform future diabetes therapies
through either the incorporation of Rnf20 into either β-cell differentiation protocols or as a biomarker for β-cell
health. Furthermore, the proposed research plan provides a balanced training platform wherein I will expand
both my critical thinking and technical skillset through my investigations of novel regulatory mechanisms of β-
cell homeostasis. As a trainee at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) and in UAB’s Diabetes
Research Center, I have access to a strong community of supportive faculty members to assist in the successful
completion of the proposed study. Taken together, this research and training plan is a fundamental catalyst of
my trajectory toward becoming an independent research scientist."
10823739,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Growing emphasis on the early diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD)
increases the demand for providers to make informed care decisions. Most of the care for people recently
diagnosed with ADRD falls on primary care physicians (PCPs), as frontline providers for older adults. Many of
the clinical decisions PCPs must make to care for patients with ADRD are not currently supported by robust
evidence. Given the heterogeneity of ADRD, we cannot rely on randomized trials to provide evidence for
clinical decisions across the range of conditions and unique patient/family considerations. Unclear guidelines
on treatment strategies lead to large inconsistencies in how patients are treated, potentially causing harm and
exacerbating health inequities. There is a large and growing need for evidence on best practices in early
dementia care using accessible, timely data, and rigorous methods. This F31 career development proposal is
designed to prepare the candidate for a career focused on this critical area, delivering much-needed evidence
to guide common clinical decisions to provide the best possible care for individuals with early ADRD. The
research plan evaluates three important clinical decisions commonly encountered by PCPs caring for patients
experiencing cognitive decline. Aim 1 will evaluate whether referral to dementia specialty care delays onset of
patient frailty using electronic health record (EHR) data from University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)
primary care clinics. The candidate will use both traditional observational methods and an instrumental variable
analysis with physician preference for referral as an instrument. Aim 2 investigates whether prescriptions of an
antidementia drug (memantine) are associated with incident frailty using both traditional observational methods
and an emulated target trial design analysis using UCSF EHR data. Finally, many conditions, including urinary
tract infections (UTIs), are not specific to patients with ADRD but are more common among older adults with
cognitive decline. In the context of emerging cognitive declines, inappropriate UTI management (especially if
drug resistant) may be especially harmful. In Aim 3, we will examine whether early treatment of UTIs caused
by drug-resistant E. coli is associated with reduced risk of incident ADRD and patient frailty using EHR data
from UCSF and the San Francisco safety net public healthcare system. This proposal will demonstrate use of
EHR data to evaluate the efficacy of current and future innovations in dementia care across diverse patients,
with the goal of contributing to informed clinical guidelines for PCPs. This research will directly contribute to the
NIA’s goal to provide evidence to delay ADRD progression. Guided by an interdisciplinary and expert
mentorship team, the proposed training will enhance the candidate’s knowledge of clinical care for ADRD,
advanced causal inference and econometric methods, and clinical informatics. Facilitated by the supportive
training environment at UCSF, executing this F31 research and training plan will prepare the candidate to
succeed in a career as an independent translational researcher in dementia epidemiology."
10823936,"ABSTRACT
The rotator cuff is composed of 4 muscles that stabilize the shoulder and controls upper arm range of motion. Tears in the
tendons of these muscles, known as rotator cuff tears (RCTs), are among the most common debilitating shoulder injuries.
While RCTs can be surgically repaired, the rate of retear is significant and has been correlated to high levels of rotator cuff
muscle fatty infiltration and fibrosis. The precise source of this intramuscular fat and fibrosis is unclear; however, a
heterogeneous population of muscle resident non-myogenic mesenchymal cells, known as fibroadipogenic progenitors
(FAPs), have been implicated in many skeletal muscle pathologies, particularly those in which intramuscular fat and fibrosis
are abundant—as seen in RCTs. We and others have recently demonstrated in mice that PDGFRa-expressing FAPs expand
following massive RCTs and likely contribute to the accumulation of intramuscular fat and fibrosis that accompanies rotator
cuff muscle atrophy. While these findings are important, virtually nothing is known regarding the molecular signals associated
with the promotion of FAP differentiation into fibrogenic and adipogenic fates, nor the factors that may be secreted by FAPs
to drive rotator cuff muscle atrophy following RCT. Utilizing murine models of massive RCTs, genetic lineage tracing/reporter
analysis, ex vivo functional testing, as well as sophisticated bulk RNA-sequencing assays from isolated FAPs and muscle
fibers, we will define the precise tissue, cellular, and molecular changes associated with the rotator cuff muscle pathology
following RCTs (Aim 1). Further, it remains unknown if the novel FAP subpopulations discovered by our lab in lower limb
muscles exist within the rotator cuff musculature, or whether these specific FAP subpopulations change following RCT. Using
murine models of massive RCTs, genetic reporter analysis, sophisticated single cell RNA-sequencing assays, and lightsheet
microscopy, we will identify FAP heterogeneity within rotator cuff muscles following massive RCTs (Aim 2). These Aims will
ultimately address my overarching hypothesis that FAPs or FAP subpopulations are critical regulators of the rotator cuff
muscle pathology following massive RCT, which involves specific cytokines, adipokines, and other signaling molecules that
promote adipogenesis, fibrogenesis, and muscle atrophy, and prevent regeneration. This work will provide vital information
to our understanding of the cellular and molecular roles for FAPs in RCT induced fatty infiltration, fibrosis, and the muscle
atrophy associated with RCTs."
10824072,"Abstract (30 line max)
 Diabetes mellitus is the leading cause of kidney failure, heart disease, and stroke, affecting 537 million people
worldwide. Diabetes is diagnosed as an increase in blood glucose due to insufficient or ineffective insulin
production by the pancreatic β-cell. The inability of the β-cell to adapt to changes in physiologic demand results
in hyperglycemia. Under select conditions, such as injury and high-fat diet, the β-cell is capable of expansion,
increasing in size and/or number to increase insulin production. Therefore, one potential strategy for mitigating
hyperglycemic events is to stimulate β-cell replication. A crucial component for β-cell maturation and β-cell
expansion in the adult pancreas is macrophages which support tissue growth through the production of cytokines
and stimulatory factors. In models of injury, macrophages shift from their basal classically activated
proinflammatory state to a more alternatively-activated anti-inflammatory state, supportive of tissue remodeling
through the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as TGF-β. Robust β-cell proliferation has also been
measured during pregnancy as a result of reductions in insulin sensitivity and increased fetal demand, making
pregnancy an ideal model for investigating expansion in mature β-cells under non-pathologic conditions. β-cell
expansion during gestation and macrophage contribution to maternal β-cell growth has not been fully elucidated.
I will assess changes in macrophage quantity and phenotype throughout pregnancy. I will determine the source
of macrophage accumulation within the islet and whether it is a critical component for β-cell expansion in late
gestation. I will also determine whether depletion of islet resident macrophages impairs β-cell expansion in late
gestation. I hypothesize that pregnancy drives islet macrophages to an alternatively-activated phenotype,
necessary for maternal β-cell expansion. To test this hypothesis, I will explore the following two aims: (1)
Characterize the macrophage population within the islet throughout gestation. (2) Establish the requirement of
macrophages for maternal β-cell expansion in late gestation. The completion of these aims will identify
macrophage-specific responses during pregnancy and their effects on β-cell expansion.

10827416,"Project Summary
 The human fungal pathogen Candida albicans is a leading cause of hospital-acquired bloodstream
infections and can disseminate to become lethal. There is an urgent need to improve the therapeutic
management of C. albicans infections, since current antifungal drugs have limited effectiveness and
drug-resistant strains are emerging. The pathogenic effects of C. albicans are caused by its ability to
grow in the host and disseminate to internal organs. The plasma membrane is fundamentally important
for these processes, as this essential barrier mediates a wide range of functions that are critical for
virulence including cell wall synthesis, secretion of virulence factors, morphogenesis, and nutrient
uptake. The importance of the plasma membrane is highlighted by the fact that it is the target for most of
the currently used antifungal drugs and many antimicrobial peptides. Therefore, a better understanding
of plasma membrane organization and function is needed to facilitate the design of new therapeutic
treatments and to increase the effectiveness of current antifungal drugs. To address this gap in
knowledge, the Aims are designed to take advantage of recent discoveries to identify novel mechanisms
by which the plasma membrane protects C. albicans from stressful conditions in the host. Aim 1 is to
define the mechanisms that protect the plasma membrane against the oxidative burst in the host, which
can cause a chain reaction of lipid peroxidation that destroys membrane integrity. These studies will
leverage our recent identification of a new pathway that protects C. albicans against lipid peroxidation.
Aim 2 will define how the PM resists stress caused by HOCl (hypochlorous acid; bleach) that is produced
by myeloperoxidase during the neutrophil oxidative burst. Although neutrophils are well known to
produce HOCl, little is known about its effects on the plasma membrane or how C. albicans protects
against it. Aim 3 is to define how the C. albicans PM plays a key role in resisting copper and cell wall
stress, which are also encountered in the phagosome. This aim takes advantage of our discovery that
specialized plasma membrane subdomains known as eisosomes or MCC domains promote proper PM
architecture needed for resistance to copper and cell wall stress. Defining how the C. albicans plasma
membrane resists stress is expected to reveal novel mechanisms of pathogenesis that will aid future
studies in development of new therapeutic approaches and increase our understanding of current
antifungal drugs to improve the prospects for their more effective use."
10827420,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Obesity-related type 2 diabetes (T2D) is the most common emerging metabolic disease in the US population.
Insulin resistance is a key etiological factor of T2D. Adiponectin is an adipocyte-secreted hormone and
prevents the development of insulin resistance. Recent studies show that adiponectin decreases the
expression of hepatic gluconeogenic enzymes, attenuates glucose production, and enhances the hepatic
effects of insulin through the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. However, the resilience factors
that are required to maintain adiponectin-mediated AMPK activation in the liver remain unclear. This proposal
is designed to fill gaps in our knowledge concerning the role of NgBR in regulating adiponectin-
mediated AMPK activation and hepatic gluconeogenesis, and to determine if preserving hepatic NgBR
expression is sufficient to prevent the onset of obesity-related T2D. Recent studies from our laboratory
suggest that NgBR plays a previously unrecognized role in maintaining AMPK activation because NgBR binds
the farnesylated form of liver kinase B1 (LKB1-farn), a key regulator of AMPK. Preliminary results show that
NgBR expression decreases in the liver of diabetic animal models and the liver of T2D obese patients
compared to non-T2D obese subjects. NgBR hepatocyte-specific knockout (hepKO) mice showed an increase
in fasting glucose levels and further increases plasma glucose to T2D levels after high-fat diet (HFD) feeding.
NgBR deficiency in hepatocytes impairs AMPK activation induced by AdipoRon (an agonist of adiponectin
receptors). These findings lead us to propose a central hypothesis that NgBR is a resilience factor required
for preserving adiponectin-mediated insulin sensitivity and preventing the onset of obesity-caused T2D, and
disruption of the NgBR-dependent regulation system in the liver leads to impairing gluconeogenesis regulation
and insulin sensitivity. Our overall objectives are to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which NgBR
enhances adiponectin-mediated insulin sensitivity and the roles that NgBR plays in the pathogenesis of insulin
resistance and T2D. Delineating the mechanisms by which NgBR regulates LKB1 translocation will allow us to
develop new therapeutic strategies for preventing the onset of T2D in obese subjects. Accordingly, we will test
our hypothesis with two specific aims. Aim 1. Determine the molecular mechanism by which NgBR regulates
LKB1-AMPK activation and adiponectin signaling pathway in the liver. Aim 2. Determine the molecular
mechanism by which NgBR regulates insulin signaling and hepatic gluconeogenesis. Successful completion of
studies proposed in this proposal will characterize NgBR as a resilience factor for preventing T2D and provide
novel insights for T2D prevention or treatment. Our studies will lead to many discoveries that will significantly
improve the health of US citizens and others suffering from T2D. Our studies will reveal new concepts and
ideas that can be used to develop therapies for treating insulin resistance. Accordingly, the translational
potential of this application is promising and highly relevant to NIH's mission."
10827448,"We have launched a collaborative effort between MD Anderson Cancer Center and University of
Texas at Dallas that uses dorsal root ganglion (DRG) removed from pain phenotyped patients
during neurological surgery. DRGs are taken from thoracic levels during a spine stabilization
surgery and then cut in thirds. One third is saved for immunohistochemistry (IHC) or in situ
hybridization (ISH), one third goes for culturing and electrophysiology, and one third is used for
RNA sequencing. We have developed an extensive dataset with patient pain phenotype
information, DRG neuron electrophysiological characterization and RNA sequencing. In many
cases we have pairs of DRGs from the same patient where the patient had pain in one
dermatome and not in another, allowing for precise case-control analysis. Our electrophysiology
results clearly demonstrate that chronic pain is associated with spontaneous activity (SA) in
DRG nociceptors. This is the first time that this has been demonstrated. Our RNA sequencing
results identify transcriptional changes associated with chronic pain and SA in the DRG that
show indications of sexual dimorphism. In males we find clear signs of immune infiltration and
neuro-immune interactions as well as an increase in expression for some members of the
FOS/JUN transcription factor family. In females we see an upregulation of some G-protein
coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other signs of intrinsic changes in neuronal excitability. These
findings give unique insights into drivers of chronic pain in the DRG in a diverse cohort of
patients with important implications for chronic pain therapeutic development, including the
potential need for sex-specific treatment. Our overarching hypothesis is that SA in human DRG
neurons, which is a critical factor for pain generation in patients, is driven by fundamentally
different mechanisms in male and female patients. We will test this hypothesis using human
DRG samples and a combination of electrophysiology (Aim 1) and RNA-seq (Aim 2). In Aim 3
IHC and ISH along with pharmacological interventions guided by preliminary findings and data
generated during this project will be used to define new potential therapeutic avenues. In sum,
the experiments in this project will give fundamental new insight into mechanisms of chronic
pain that will enable therapeutic and biomarker discovery with the opportunity for an almost
immediate impact on clinical care."
10823439,"Project Summary/Abstract
CD8 T cells are critical to the adaptive immune response to viral pathogens. When neutralizing antibodies are
insufficient to prevent viral infection outright, virus-specific memory CD8 T cells can rapidly kill infected cells and
limit the severity of infection. This has recently been identified as a potentially key mechanism by which COVID-
19 disease severity is reduced in vaccinated individuals. Memory CD8 T cells are functionally heterogeneous
within and between individuals, with some cells more capable of effectively responding during viral infection. In
the worst cases, dysfunctional CD8 T cell responses or ongoing responses to chronic viral infections could cause
persistent and debilitating symptoms, as may be the case in Long COVID. Our understanding of the dynamics
of human CD8 T cell differentiation remains incomplete, including why individuals generate functionally different
responses to an identical antigen. Developing effective vaccines will require an understanding of shared
molecular programs that can lead to potent effector responses across a range of individual immune landscapes
and CD8 T cell identities. Two key gaps in knowledge impair our ability to fully leverage the potential of T cells
in vaccines. First, little is known about the lineages that produce functionally distinct T cells in humans and what
factors promote different lineages. Second, it is unclear which CD8 T cell states retain the greatest capacity to
mount a potent effector response to combat infection. Therefore, there is an urgent need to define human
memory CD8 T cell differentiation trajectories, how they impact future responses to viral pathogens, and how
they may be dysregulated in cases where symptoms fail to resolve, such as Long COVID. We will address this
need by testing three working hypotheses: first, that T cell clones differentiate down lineages with distinct
functional capacities; second, that epigenetic features leave some lineages poised to mount more potent
responses; and third, that the immune landscape influences CD8 T cell differentiation and functionality, with
multiple classes of immune dysregulation driving Long COVID pathology. In Aims 1-2, we will use custom HLA-
I/peptide tetramers to sort rare Spike-specific CD8 T cells from 5 individuals at each of a longitudinal series of
memory and acute responding time points. We will then perform two cutting-edge single-cell sequencing
approaches that use T cell receptor and mitochondrial variant sequences to define T cell clones and track the
differentiation of these clones over time while assessing cell states by mRNA expression, protein expression,
and chromatin accessibility. Aim 3 will use a systems immunology approach in healthy vaccinees and Long
COVID patients to identify features of the immune landscape that correlate with optimal, sub-optimal, and
dysregulated CD8 T cell responses. Collectively, these studies will evaluate multiple possible causes of Long
COVID and will define the CD8 T cell differentiation lineages that produce optimal responses, providing a
blueprint for improved vaccines to reduce severe disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, Influenza, and other viruses."

Due to advances in geroscience, aging must be considered a modifiable risk factor for the major causes of
death. Interventions targeting human aging are ongoing, but there is a lack of predictive biomarkers to
measure the effectiveness of these interventions. With age, somatically-derived mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
deletions clonally accumulate within individual cells across a variety of tissues. Attaining high intracellular
abundance, mtDNA deletions disrupt oxidative phosphorylation, cellular function, and result in cell death. We
hypothesize that human mtDNA deletion frequency predicts the risk of morbidity and mortality and responds to
interventions that alter healthspan.
We have developed a digital PCR assay that quantifies mtDNA deletion frequency using total DNA samples
from any tissue in rodents and humans. This assay provides absolute quantitation, is amenable to a 96-well
format, correlates strongly with the subsequent cellular phenotypes including cell death, and has a detection
limit below one part per million. MtDNA deletion mutation frequency increases exponentially with age and this
increase parallels the age-induced accumulation of dysfunctional cells, tissue degeneration, and mortality. This
project will further develop and validate mtDNA deletion frequency as a measure of cell death in human aging.
We are validating the test in accordance with FDA guidelines for bioanalytical assays. We are measuring
mtDNA deletion frequency in a number of human tissues and biofluids across the human lifespan and will
establish the relationship between mtDNA deletion frequency, chronological age, clinical and physiological
outcomes, and interventions targeting human aging."

Adolescence is a time of substantial development attributed to the maturation of brain circuits that underlie the
acquisition of new cognitive, emotional, and social skills. It is also a time of maximum vulnerability for mental
disorders. In the past decade, the incidence of anxiety, depression, and suicide increased by ~60% in
adolescents, remarkably more in females than in males. The social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic
added to the severity of the national and international statistics. To fully address the current youth mental
health crisis, we need to understand how and why the dramatic reorganization of the adolescent brain
contributes to the increased vulnerability to mental disorders. The studies proposed here rest on the
assumption that the remodeling of the reward circuits of the brain creates the shared foundation of cognitive,
affective, and social maturation during adolescence. Our multifaceted project addresses foundational gaps in
our knowledge on how reward-driven motivational states inform adolescent behaviors such as risk-taking,
pleasure-seeking, impulsivity, and a range of emotional responses to challenges of the social environment. We
designed a within-subject, longitudinal study that spans the 2.5 - 3-year duration of adolescence in non-human
primates. During this period, we will obtain repeated samplings of neurophysiological data recorded from the
amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex in the context of the same behavioral tasks. In parallel, we will longitudinally
monitor morphometric and microstructural changes in the gray and white matter of the brain through serial MRI
scans, complemented by physical and hormonal measures of pubertal maturation. The three specific aims
address the neural basis of three different aspects of reward processing in the subcircuit of the amygdala and
orbitofrontal cortex. First, we will use a delay discounting task to determine the cellular and circuit level
changes that underlie the increasing tolerance (or lack thereof) for delayed rewards. Second, we use a social
reward-allocation task to test the neural underpinning of social reward processing in a self-oriented and an
other-oriented social frame of reference. Finally, we will determine where and how social status is processed in
the adolescent brain. Understanding social status relies on the ability to form abstract representations and is
also a prerequisite for the successful integration of the individual into a hierarchical adult social group. The
team, with combined expertise in human and non-human primate social behavior, neurophysiology,
neuroimaging, and endocrinology, will apply conceptually and technically innovative approaches to generate
unique and translational data, at both cellular and circuit levels, that account for the emerging cognitive,
affective, and social skills acquired during adolescence."
10813049,"Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is common in Veterans and associated with a number of negative
physical and mental health consequences. While evidence-based pharmacological and psychosocial
interventions for PTSD have been developed, not all patients respond fully to treatment. Investigating the
biological processes involved in the development and maintenance of PTSD will increase understanding of the
disorder and aid in the development of more effective interventions. Sleep disruption, particularly Rapid Eye
Movement (REM) sleep disruption, is a potent and modifiable risk factor contributing to PTSD. For example,
longitudinal studies have shown REM sleep fragmentation in the acute aftermath of trauma predicts PTSD
symptoms at a later timepoint, underscoring the potential importance of sleep as a mechanism in PTSD.
Recent research has also demonstrated an association between poor sleep and impaired emotion regulation.
Specifically, research suggests disrupted sleep impairs effective emotion regulation strategies, such as
cognitive reappraisal, while increasing reliance on more maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, such as
expressive suppression. For example, previous studies have shown poor sleep at baseline predicts impaired
cognitive reappraisal in lab-based tasks involving emotionally provocative stimuli. Our research group has also
demonstrated that poor self-reported global sleep quality is associated with reduced cognitive reappraisal and
increased reliance on expressive suppression when measured at one timepoint in a large group of Veterans
with and without PTSD. The implications of this finding are particularly salient for patients with PTSD, because
maladaptive emotion regulation contributes to severity of trauma-related symptoms, increases distress, and
interferes with gold-standard interventions for PTSD. However, most research linking disrupted sleep to
impaired emotion regulation has been conducted in healthy controls, or at only one time-point in clinical
samples. Therefore, additional research is necessary to provide support for a hypothesized model whereby
disrupted sleep contributes to maladaptive emotion regulation, thus in turn maintaining trauma-related
symptoms. This study responds to these gaps in the literature by using both self-report longitudinal measures
and an experimental sleep manipulation to test the hypothesis that disrupted sleep contributes to maladaptive
emotion regulation in Veterans with and without PTSD. The first aim of the study will be to examine whether
poor sleep at one timepoint predicts maladaptive emotion regulation and trauma-related symptoms at
subsequent timepoints in a large cohort of Veterans with and without PTSD. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI),
the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ), and the PTSD Checklist (PCL) will be measured at three
timepoints in this cohort. We hypothesize that poor sleep at the first timepoint will predict reduced reappraisal,
increased expressive suppression, and increased severity of trauma-related symptoms at the subsequent
timepoints. The second portion of the proposed project will build upon these findings by experimentally testing
the notion that disrupted sleep results in impaired emotion regulation, and will also directly test the hypothesis
that REM sleep specifically is tied to emotion regulation processes. A sample of Veterans (n = 60) with and
without PTSD will be recruited and randomized to undergo one of three sleep conditions: 1) one night of REM
sleep deprivation (REMD), 2) one night of slow-wave sleep deprivation (SWSD, an active control condition), or
3) one night of normal sleep. Participants will then participate in two laboratory emotion reappraisal tasks using
images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). We hypothesize that participants in the REMD
group will rate the images more negatively during a cognitive reappraisal task than SWSD group or the normal
sleep group, and will also be more likely to choose expressive suppression than reappraisal on an emotion
regulation choice task. Exploratory analyses will determine if this effect differs by diagnostic group status."

Growing evidence indicates that disrupted mitochondrial function in alveolar epithelial cells and in fibroblasts
can disrupt lung repair. Mitochondrial bioenergetics and metabolism play central roles in stem and progenitor
cell functions in other organs, shifting between mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis to meet the needs of
repair, but have received limited attention in the lung. This proposal will use a rare lung disease as model to
investigate how bioenergetics and metabolism regulate the dynamic events of alveolar epithelial repair.
Hermansky Pudlak syndrome type 1 (HPS-1) patients with mutations in HPS1 exhibit highly penetrant, early
onset, fibrosing interstitial lung disease. We hypothesize that by disrupting mitochondrial networking,
loss of HPS1 impairs mitochondrial respiration, fostering metabolic reprogramming that drives AT2
progenitor cell proliferation at the expense of differentiation, and stimulates pro-fibrotic epithelial-to-
fibroblast signaling. Aim 1 will establish the role of HPS1 in alveolar type 2 (AT2) cell bioenergetics and
metabolism, Aim 2 will determine the impact of HPS1 loss on alveolar epithelial repair, and Aim 3 will identify
how metabolic reprograming in AT2 cells drives fibrotic repair. We will accomplish these studies using robust
MLE15 cell models, primary lung cells from pale ear mice with global inactivation of Hps1, a novel Hps1flox/flox

patient-derived iPS cells with the common HPS1 mutation to provide translational relevance to humans, and
the repetitive bleomycin model to generalize our findings beyond a rare lung disease. The expertise of our
laboratory group coupled with the strength of the pulmonary and mitochondrial communities at Vanderbilt

10813062,"Project Summary
Our rapidly evolving understanding of how genomes function and how genomic variation inﬂuences the
development and progression of diseases drive our ability to develop novel diagnostics and therapeutics.
Genomic data science plays a critical role in this process, relying on the availability of computational tools for
statistical and visual analysis of large-scale and complex data sets. The growing genomics workforce that relies
on these tools includes scientists with a broad set of expertise and needs. Experimental scientists use tools with
graphical user interfaces to interpret their data; computational biologists write pipelines or code for ad hoc
analysis in interactive environments, and software developers build sophisticated data portals and other
web-based tools. While a large number of genomic data visualization tools for these audiences exist, there is a
lack of a uniﬁed approach that would allow a larger audience to design and implement their own interactive
data visualization tools for genomic data. To address this gap, we will develop a visualization framework
based on a novel grammar for interactive, scalable visualization of genome-mapped data. The visualizations
deﬁned using this grammar will be interactive, responsive, and scalable. These features will be enabled by
rendering the visualizations using an extension of HiGlass. HiGlass is our framework for genomic data
visualization that supports multi-scale data visualization, and multiple linked views. The grammar design will
be guided by a taxonomy of genomic visualizations and visual analysis tasks that comprehensively describe
the space of interactive visualizations currently in use for genomic data. The grammar will support the
creation of visualizations with diﬀerent genome layouts, visual encodings of data, and ﬂexible conﬁgurations
of multiple linked views. Furthermore, we will incorporate a taxonomy of metadata visualizations, for
example, of phenotypic data, that are frequently linked to genomic data. To create visualizations based on the
proposed grammar, a JavaScript library, a Python package, an R package, and an interactive visualization
editor will be developed. This editor will be web-based and have a drag-and-drop interface for data and
visualization components. In addition to the genomic visualization grammar, our framework will also contain
a genomic visualization recommendation system that can generate interactive visualizations based on a
description of a data set and the analysis tasks that the user intends to accomplish. This will enable novices to
create eﬀective visualizations without knowledge of visualization design. The recommendation system will
also accelerate visual analysis for more experienced users, as the visualization design can be automated and
customized. The recommendation system will be available through the R and Python packages and the
interactive visualization editor. In addition to producing visualization designs using our proposed grammar,
this recommendation system can also be used to recommend existing tools that implement speciﬁc
visualization capabilities."
10933571,"Project Summary
The rich multi-contrast capabilities of MRI enable the detection of a broad spectrum of tissue alterations due to cerebrovascular disease, brain injury, and other insults that significantly impact brain and cognitive health. As new noninvasive imaging technologies are developed to explore causal mechanisms of small vessel disease and blood-brain barrier integrity, there is a need for postmortem validation studies to confirm the pathological basis of early imaging biomarkers driving vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia. Our current understanding of the pathophysiology of post-traumatic neurodegeneration and Alzheimer’s disease comes from 2D neuropathology and histology in which slices are cut, stained, and examined under a microscope. While these techniques yield stunning images with beautiful specificity, they lose the 3D architectural context that is critical for understanding how neuropathological changes alter connectivity and mesoscopic anatomy in the living human brain. The overall goal of this project is to build a pipeline of customized MRI acquisitions and software algorithms designed to provide a mechanistic link between neuropathology and ex vivo MRI, and from there to in vivo human brain mapping atlases. Our project will result in a well-maintained, documented, and distributed set of tools and MRI sequences that sites can download and use to map information between neuropathology and MRI. Furthermore, we will have access to precious brain donations from subjects who had high-quality in vivo multi-modal MRI, enabling us to extend the pipeline to map neuropathological findings of cerebrovascular disease and traumatic brain injury back to imaging data acquired in living subjects. By precisely mapping histopathology to ex vivo MRI and to in vivo MRI, we will develop and discover in vivo MRI biomarkers that can currently only be identified ex vivo."
10811056,"A Novel Vaccine Adjuvant KOR-selective Small Molecule Agonist
ABSTRACT
Discovering safe and effective adjuvants that are crucial for vaccine efficacy is a key challenge. The skin is an
ideal accessible target for vaccination. Identifying clinical small molecules with potent adjuvant properties to
enable a desirable skin immune microenvironment as a prelude to promote vaccine inducing pathogen and tumor
antigen-specific T cell and antibody responses against infectious disease and cancer is an urgent need in clinic.
Through screening the NIH Clinical Collection using human skin explant and mouse models, we have identified
GR89696, a kappa opioid receptor (KOR)-selective small molecule agonist, triggering gene-expression of pro-
inflammatory cytokines and chemokines with adjuvant effects in skin and increasing skin-infiltration of dendritic
cell subsets with specialized capacities for activating CD8 T cells. GR89696 enhances transdermally delivered
(via microneedle array) protein vaccine inducing tumor antigen-specific IFNγ+CD8 T cells and antitumor
immunity. Clinical KOR-selective small molecule agonist Nalfurafine enhances intradermally delivered protein
vaccine inducing antitumor immunity and virus antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies. We hypothesize that
KOR-selective small molecule agonist is a novel vaccine adjuvant. We will verify adjuvant effects of KOR-
selective small molecule agonist via KOR activation in skin and assess KOR-selective small molecule agonist
adjuvanted vaccine. If successful, we will discover an unexpected adjuvant pathway (targeting KOR) leading to
a novel KOR-selective small molecule agonist adjuvanted skin vaccination with the high translational potential."

10933026,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Breast cancer (BC) is not only a heterogenous disease by itself but it also has a differential racial impact.
Prognostically, it has an inferior outcome in women of African American (AA) descent as compared to European
American. BC in women of African ancestry presents at a younger age and is associated with more advanced
disease and higher mortality rates as compared to breast cancer in age-matched patients of EA or Asian ancestry
(AsA). Several factors, including ethnicity and social determinants of health factors (SDOH), including obesity
adds to the complexity to nature of the disease. The chronicity of these environmental stressors has played a
determinate role in racial/ethnic BC inequities. We propose to investigate the intersection of SDOH and biological
determinants of tumor biology by examining the convergence of obesity- and ancestry-related inflammatory
factors and their consequences on tumor genomic and immunological landscapes. In this project, the association
of the obesity-associated inflammatory signature for those with African ancestry in admixed-African BC patients
in Black Belt Alabama will be explored. We will determine genetic ancestry-associated differences in tumor
immune microenvironments linked to systemic inflammation and obesity. To do so, we have adopted the
Tuskegee Total Cancer Care protocol, which partners with local health care providers and patients with the goals
of using longitudinally collected data and biospecimens to develop an evidence-based approach that meets the
needs of minority patients. We will work through three distinct specific aims, utilizing case-control studies, which
will flow hierarchically from broad patient-centered population-level factors to systemic-and genomic-level factors
to characteristics tumors and heterogeneous cell types within the tumor. These will help define distinct risk factors
that capture both the social and biological mechanisms that underlie tumor phenotypes. Integration of these data
will provide new opportunities to develop interventions that, on a community level, will help to overcome immune
and inflammation-driven/obesity-related BC progression"

In the US, human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines have the potential to prevent 33,700 HPV cancers each
year, but vaccine coverage rates remain low in the southeast, which has the highest rates of HPV-related
cancers. Vaccination rates are particularly low in Alabama. Vaccines for Children (VFC), a program
administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), provides free vaccines for
administration to children under 18 years and who are enrolled in Medicaid or are uninsured. Adults aged 19-
45 enrolled in Medicaid or uninsured are eligible to receive free HPV vaccine through the Family Planning
Program of the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH). To improve the benefits of these programs in
Alabama’s Barbour, Bullock, Lowndes, and Macon Counties, we will conduct a health communication
campaign targeting adults ages18 and older to explore the use of these programs through primary care
physicians and local health centers as HPV vaccination sites. We have developed an electronic application
(app), Protect Me from HPV, to help participants access information about HPV and HPV-related cancers, and
to complete surveys. The Apple store and the office of External Affairs and General Counsel at Tuskegee
University (TU), approved the app. Patent acquisition for this application is in progress. We developed an
anonymous 44-item survey to identify barriers/facilitators to HPV vaccination, it will be distributed within these
counties by TU specific-investigators, 2 primary care physicians, and 9 local health centers, which were
identified in these counties through the ADPH as VFC and Family Planning Programs providers. From each
facility, 5-15 physicians, nurses, and staff members will be invited to complete the survey, which will include
questions covering general services offered, current HPV vaccines administered and frequency of
administration, workflows supporting vaccination and participation in these programs, whether/how they
recommend the HPV vaccine, how their patients currently obtain such vaccines and barriers/facilitators to
HPV vaccination. Second, we will utilize 70-item-pre- and 63-item-post-surveys during short and long-term
educational interventions. This study will take place in each county. We will use results from the analysis
of initial surveys from a one-day short-term educational intervention to revise the educational strategies based
on participants’ feedback. In each county, a 2nd 63-item post-survey will be administered 3 months after the
first workshop and once a year for 4 years in each county to evaluate the effect of long-term education
intervention. During this period, HPV health communication campaigns targeting participants will be
continued. Third, the feasibility test will allow us to identify areas for improvement of the app. Our goal is to
improve HPV vaccination rates in Alabama’s Black Belt Counties (BBCs). The proposed research will provide
a foundation to explore the use of community pharmacies as HPV vaccination sites via federally funded
programs in BBCs. (See the attached IRB approval)."
10933032,"Project Summary
This proposal aims to develop QNBC as the lead indication for our ADRM1 inhibitor, Up284,
and support biomarker development to select QNBC patients for ADRM1 inhibitor therapy. It
addresses critical questions for the development of effective and safe treatments for QNBC and
the reduction of the disparity in breast cancer outcomes.
Quadruple negative breast cancer (QNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer that does not express
the hormone receptors ER and PR, the growth factor receptor HER2, and the androgen
receptor AR. QNBC has the poorest prognosis among breast cancer subtypes and
disproportionately affects African Americans. Currently, there is no standard-of-care treatment
for QNBC, and there is an urgent need to develop effective and safe treatments and biomarkers
to address this unmet medical need and the disparity in breast cancer outcomes. Our research
team has recently found that elevated expression of proteasome subunit ADRM1 is associated
with both African American race and lower survival in QNBC patients. Our collaborator Up
Therapeutics developed an inhibitor called Up284 that targets ADRM1. While QNBC and triple
negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines show evidence of greater vulnerability to
proteasome inhibitors, approved 20S proteasome inhibitors like bortezomib have proven
ineffective against solid tumors due to their partial proteasome inhibition, inability to achieve
therapeutic doses, and poor pharmacokinetic properties. Up284 is a novel small molecule
designed to overcome these limitations. Its structure is a non-peptide spiro compound with
improved drug access and favorable pharmacokinetic properties to solid tumors compared to
peptide-based 20S inhibitors. Up284 also blocks substrate recognition and deubiquitination,
providing full proteasome inhibition and avoiding key toxicities like thrombocytopenia and
neutropenia. In vitro studies show that Up284 has broad anticancer activity, including against
QNBC lines and patient-derived organoids. It has a promising safety profile and
pharmacodynamics and can control syngeneic and xenograft tumors. By inhibiting
proteasome ubiquitin receptor ADRM1 function and its associated deubiquitinase activity,
Up284 triggers more rapid accumulation and increased molecular weight polyubiquitinated
protein aggregates than 20S inhibitors. These toxic misfolded protein aggregates produce
unresolved ER stress and activate the canonical Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) signaling
cascade, leading to more rapid apoptosis than 20S inhibitors. We plan to examine ADRM1 and
ER stress markers' expression in diverse QNBC patient samples and validate sensitivity to
Up284 to develop a biomarker for selecting patients for better therapeutic efficacy and
safety. We also will validate the synergy of Up284 efficacy in combination with in-clinic
chemotherapeutic agents used to treat TNBC to improve therapeutic response and block the
emergence of resistance. Finally, we will assess Up284's potential to induce antitumor immune
response in combination with checkpoint inhibitors, notably with anti-PDL1 or anti-PD1
inhibitors."

Tuskegee University Center for Biomedical Research (CBR) Research Centers at Minority Institutions
(RCMI) proposes the Investigator Development Core (IDC) to accelerate its past achievements in
enhancing the professional development and success of junior faculty supported by the program.
Towards this goal, it will provide junior-level and early-stage investigators at Tuskegee University (TU)
with the necessary resources and training to assist them in their move to the status of independent
researchers, with primary focus on the topics of minority health and health disparities. The IDC is
intended to support primarily: 1) Faculty members who are already in the field of biomedical research
but, because of their junior status, require a period of mentored career development in order to become
independent scientists in the fields of minority health and health disparities research; 2) Faculty who are
considered early-stage investigators in either non-biomedical or biomedical field, and interested in
minority health research or the translation of their existing research to the topics of minority health; and
3) Researchers who propose an approach that will have a substantial impact on the health outcomes in
the Black Belt Counties of Alabama.
 More specifically, IDC aims to: 1) Provide funding for pilot research projects from junior level
or early-stage faculty who propose projects that address minority health and health disparities or
enhance TU research capacity, 2) Coordinate and facilitate mentorship, training, and professional
developmental activities for pilot project investigators and other TU faculty with potential to initiate
minority health projects, and 3) Establish broader affiliation of TU faculty with the CBR and engage
them in Center activities to create awareness and to promote greater participation in the overall aims of
the CBR/RCMI.
 To achieve these aims, the IDC will coordinate and integrate its efforts with the Administrative
Core, the Capacity Building Core, the Community Engagement Core, our existing extramural
collaborative networks and the CBR program evaluation system. Multiple internal and external resources
will be leveraged and synergized to develop a broad-based investigator pool to grow biomedical
research at TU to even higher levels. The IDC support is expected to advance the professional growth
of junior faculty at TU by enhancing their productivity, competitiveness, and potential to be established
researchers on diseases that disproportionately impact minority populations."

Mutations in oncogenes encode proteins with gain-of-function biological properties that enhance fitness.
Historically, heterozygous mutations in oncogenes have been viewed as sufficient to induce cancer initiation or
promote cancer progression. However, oncogenic driver mutations often co-exist with extensive genomic gains
and losses. Yet, the interplay between these two fundamental properties of cancer genomes is poorly
understood. We recently showed that increased KRAS G12D copy number and subsequent loss of the WT
KRAS allele in leukemias leads to increased competitive fitness at the cost of increased MAP kinase pathway
dependence. In subsequent preliminary studies, we showed that zygosity changes targeting gain-of-function
oncogenic mutations are frequently selected for during cancer evolution and have prognostic and therapeutic
implications. These findings allude to broader growth suppressive effects of the WT allele on mutant oncogene
function and underscore the potential clinical importance of prospectively identifying for physicians and patients
changes in mutant oncogene zygosity within the context of precision oncology. Yet, without principled methods
for characterizing the extent and significance of oncogenic mutant allele imbalance, the gap in our
understanding of oncogene biology and therapy will widen. We therefore propose functional and translational
genomic investigations to test the hypothesis that changes in mutant oncogene zygosity dictates distinct tumor
biology and therapeutic sensitivities in cancer. In Aim 1, we leverage a cohort of 70,000 prospectively
sequenced cancer patients linked to detailed clinical and treatment annotation to establish the prevalence and
mechanisms of oncogenic mutant allele imbalance. We will identify the degree to which allelic imbalance
represents a predictive biomarker of therapeutic sensitivity and create a public resource for the scientific
community to foster broader mechanistic studies of mutant oncogene zygosity. Our preliminary data indicates
that competitive fitness drives the loss of WT RAS in approximately half of all RAS-mutant tumors. Thus, in
Aim 2 we utilize advances in single-cell characterization to define the origins of such serial genetic evolution,
establishing the chronology and fitness gains of independently arising molecular changes targeting the mutant
and wildtype KRAS alleles in single cells isolated from metastatic tumors of KRAS-mutant cancer patients.
Finally, in Aim 3 we use engineered cellular systems and patient-derived xenografts to study the tumor
suppressive effect of the commonly deleted WT allele of the estrogen receptor (ER) gene in ESR1-mutant ER+
metastatic breast cancers, extending this phenomenon beyond mutant RAS for the first time. In sum, the
proposed studies seek to establish the biological and clinical significance of changes to mutant oncogene
zygosity. Through the integration with our institutional clinical sequencing initiative, we anticipate that our
findings will alter the design of clinical trials and refine broadly applicable biomarkers of therapeutic sensitivity
in molecularly defined populations of cancer patients."
10792614,"The overall objective of the proposed K23 is to support Dr. Donte Bernard in acquiring the skills necessary to
become an independent health disparities investigator with a program of research focused on the explication
and reduction of the mental health sequelae associated with racism-related trauma among Black youth. Racism-
related trauma represents a significant public health concern that is ubiquitous in the lives of Black youth. Yet,
there is a lack of research that has disentangled the unique effects of racism-related trauma relative to other
traumatic experiences. Moreover, a gap remains in the identification of culturally relevant constructs that may
underlie the link between racism-related trauma and negative mental health outcomes and may serve as
malleable targets for interventions to promote resiliency in the aftermath of racism-related events. The need for
this high impact research—and, as such, highly trained clinical scientists to lead this research—is significant and
consistent with NIMHD priorities to scientifically understand the causes of health disparity in order to improve
the lives of racial and ethnic minority communities. The proposed K23 directly addresses these limitations
through a promising candidate (with a strong foundation in racial discrimination research but need for additional
training), a comprehensive Training Plan that is supported by a team of highly successful mentors and renowned
research environment, and novel, mixed methods research, leveraging an active NIMH R01-funded longitudinal
study on child victimization and mental health, to better understand (a) experiences and responses to race-
related trauma (via qualitative methods); (b) the unique effect of racism-related trauma—above and beyond other
psychosocial traumatic events—on internalizing and externalizing mental health sequalae; and (c) how racism-
related vigilance and racial identity influence the relationship between racism-related trauma and mental health
outcomes cross sectionally and over time. Findings from these primary study aims will inform a preliminary
outline for a treatment to promote mental health resiliency in the aftermath of racism-related trauma (Exploratory
Aim). On-site mentors (Drs. Danielson, Hughes-Halbert, Moreland, and Mueller) have extensive knowledge in
child traumatic stress research, including racism-related trauma, longitudinal and mixed-methods approaches,
and intervention development and evaluation. An off-site mentor (Dr. Joe at Washington University in St. Louis)
will provide additional guidance in race-related mechanisms and examinations of externalizing mental health in
relation to racism-related experiences. The mentorship, coursework, seminars, workshops, and national
conference attendance afforded by the K23 will ensure that the candidate achieves numerous training goals,
such as enhancing knowledge of racism-related trauma; developing expertise in race-related mechanisms that
may undergird the relationship between racism-related trauma and mental health; and developing competence
in qualitative and mixed methods. The K23 activities will prepare Dr. Bernard to lead a program of high impact,
rigorously designed mental health disparities research focusing on racism-related trauma among Black youth."
10792615,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Large-scale pooled CRISPR screens have proven to be a powerful approach to identify genes that affect cell
state and behavior. Notwithstanding the countless genetic associations discovered with proliferation and drug
resistance pathways using viability or marker-based enrichment screens, there is tremendous potential for
pooled screens to go further by incorporating high complexity readouts like gene expression profiles. The cancer
community is already acting on this opportunity to access new pathways and immediately gain mechanistic
information about the nature of screening hits by interpreting the impact of perturbations on expression profiles.
However, pooled gene expression screens are underutilized and not routinely applied for large (eg. genome-
wide) screens for a simple reason - the cost of processing so many cells for single-cell gene expression readout
and carrying out the massive amount of sequence data generation required is too high.
Here, we propose to solve this problem with a method we call Stitch-seq, an ultra-high-throughput droplet-based
overlap PCR method that enables readout of the expression levels of a target gene panel in the pooled screening
context. Stitch-seq is low-cost because it does not require specialized barcoded reagents like beads and
operates as a massively parallel single-cell emulsion Rt-PCR that physically links CRISPR guide RNA
sequences to the targeted mRNA sequences by overlap extension. In the proposed work, we will characterize
the quantitative performance of the Stitch-seq reaction in detail, and demonstrate the technical and cost
performance of Stitch-seq in targeted and genome-wide screens. Stitch-seq will address the significant
throughput limitations associated with existing pooled CRISPR expression screening modalities by providing a
facile, low-cost, and ultra-high-throughput method to physically link perturbations to gene sets of interest across
a range of perturbation modalities including all manner of CRISPR perturbations (knock-out, CRISPRi,
CRISPRoff, CRISPRa, base editing, prime editing, etc.) and beyond."

Summary
Faithful execution of homologous recombination DNA repair is essential for genome integrity and is a critical
determinant of cancer etiology and therapeutic response. This relationship is prominently exemplified by
hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, which arises as a consequence of germline mutations to BRCA1 and a
network of genes encoding its interacting partners. Dysfunction within this BRCA network produces
hypersensitivity to poly(ADP)ribose polymerase inhibitors, which are clinically approved agents that have efficacy
in the setting of BRCA mutation and homologous recombination deficiency in general. Resistance frequently
occurs to these agents as a consequence of restored homologous recombination DNA repair. It is thus essential
to understand how this occurs at a fundamental mechanistic level.
We discovered that BRCA1 is targeted to lysine63-linked ubiquitin chromatin regions aligning DNA double-strand
breaks and damaged replication forks. This localization requires BRCA1 interaction with the A-complex. This
dimeric complex of five proteins includes a ubiquitin binding protein, RAP80, and a deubiquitinating enzyme,
BRCC36. RAP80 and BRCC36 are specific for binding lysine63-linked ubiquitin and its hydrolysis. Deficiency of
the A-complex reduces BRCA1 DNA damage localization and causes excessive end resection at replication fork
damage. Interestingly, loss of the A-complex confers resistance to PARP inhibitors in genetic backgrounds where
end resection is diminished. How the BRCA1-A-complex links chromatin recognition to control of end resection
and therapeutic response is not currently understood.
This proposal will integrate in vivo, cellular, and structure guided biochemical approaches to understand how the
A-complex links DNA double-strand break ubiquitin recognition on nucleosomes to homologous recombination.
To achieve these goals, we develop novel methodologies that enable us to identify the entire DNA damage
response proteome on chromatin and how this affects nucleosome modifications and stability. These studies will
yield fundamental advances to the understanding of genome integrity control and clarify new strategies to target
underlying vulnerabilities in a broad range of malignancies.

Project 4 will test the hypothesis that computationally designed protein “minibinders” and logic-gated switches

We have integrated our work plan within the highly focused U19 Project: Next Generation Translational

detection of CSF particles that have two defined protein components.
The research will iterate between computational design and experimental testing, with feedback at each stage
from CSF assay experiments conducted in collaboration with Projects 1-3 which will guide improvement of the
minibinder design methods for capture of specified CSF biomarker protein targets, and for ultra-specific logic-

10812105,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are widespread environmental contaminants that have been
investigated as developmental toxicants, with little information on long-term neurotoxicity and clinical
outcomes. Our preliminary data suggest that PFAS may produce neurotransmission changes relevant to
psychiatric disorders involving abnormal reward processing, specifically anhedonia. We will test the hypothesis
that: early life PFAS exposure will produce alterations in reward processing mediated through specific
neurotransmission targets. Importantly, the hypothesis will be tested in animal models and humans, utilizing
innovative translational approaches. We will test our hypothesis through 3 aims. Aim 1 will establish a brain -
specific translational PFAS dosing regimen in mice, based upon published and preliminary data from human
brain samples and sentinel animal studies. Here, we will develop a translational dosing strategy, specific to brain
levels that is expected to considerably increase the human health relevance of these and future studies. This aim
sets the stage for studies on the potential role of PFAS exposures in psychiatric disorders. Aim 2 will determine
if PFAS exposure produces alterations in behavioral phenotypes relevant to reward processing in mice. In light
of our preliminary data and the gap in the literature, there is a critical need to evaluate developmental
neurotoxicity in higher order species. We will assess the emergence of neurological phenotypes through
neurobehavioral analyses, neurotransmitter measurements, neuropathology studies, and determination of the
biochemical underpinnings of a reward processing phenotype. Aim 3 will determine whether serum PFAS
(individual compounds or as a mixture) are linked to human reward processing deficits. To achieve bi-
directional translation, we will conduct human studies informed by our animal data. Conversely, data from this
aim will inform ongoing animal studies. To identify links to psychiatric disorders, we will conduct a cross-
sectional study of adults aged 18 to 30 years. In this study we will: identify correlations between serum PFAS,
self-reported anhedonia severity, and clinician-rated anhedonia severity; test for clinical specificity by
examining correlations with broader symptoms of depression, mania, and psychosis; and identify correlations
between serum PFAS and neurophysiological measures of reward sensitivity, which may represent intermediate
phenotypes with disease relevance. Our findings may suggest that individuals with high PFAS levels be
carefully monitored for the emergence of psychiatric symptoms. We expect this project to have a significant
impact on the understating of environment influences of neuropsychiatric diseases. For the first time, we will
establish whether specific PFAS exposures may influence the etiology of reward processing disorders. We will
do so in both animal models and human studies – where resultant data from each line of research informs each
other to achieve bidirectional translation with respect to experimental design and interpretation."

novel cellular immunotherapeutics for pediatric blood cancers, especially T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(T-ALL). My clinical experiences as a pediatric oncologist have driven my research interest to develop better
therapies for these patients. This proposal outlines a series of preclinical experiments, which in combination
with complementary didactics and interdisciplinary mentorship, will provide a promising platform to advance my
training in immunology, cancer animal models, and cellular therapy development. This work will be completed
under the exceptional mentorship team of Drs. H. Trent Spencer, Edmund K. Waller and Douglas K. Graham,
given their collective expertise in cell and gene therapy, translational immunology and leukemia biology.
Survival for patients with relapsed T-ALL remains extremely poor. Although allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
transplant (HSCT) provides a chance of cure, attaining disease remission is necessary prior to HSCT, but is
seldom achieved. In this research, we capitalize on the promise of gamma delta (γδ) T cells which unlike the
more predominant alpha beta (αβ) T cells, do not require antigen presentation and identify their targets in a
major histocompatibility complex independent manner. Allogeneic γδ T cells, thus have a minimal risk of
causing graft-versus-host disease and can be used to create ‘off-the-shelf’ cellular therapeutics. This is ideal to
target T-ALL given the aggressive nature of relapsed disease. Inherent cytotoxic mechanisms used by γδ T
cells include recognition of cellular stress molecules such as NKG2D and DNAM-1 receptor ligands and
interactions with death pathway receptors Fas and TRAIL-R1/R2 on target cells. Our promising data shows
that these markers are overexpressed in T-ALL, making them susceptible to γδ T-cell mediated killing.
Furthermore, stress ligand expression can be upregulated by proteasome inhibition, epigenetic modification,
and through use of traditional chemotherapeutic agents. We also predict that malignant T-ALL cells can be
directly targeted by γδ T cells using CD5-directed chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). CAR T-cell therapy has
been challenging in T-ALL given the lack of a specific target antigen on cancerous T cells. However, we have
shown that expression of a CAR directed against the pan surface T-cell marker CD5, results in surface CD5
downregulation, thereby reducing the fratricidal effect among CD5-CAR T cells. Additionally, the limited
persistence of γδ T cells negates the possibility of life-threatening immune suppression from T-cell aplasia,
which may be seen with a CAR-based approach using αβ T cells. Thus, our overarching hypothesis is that the
intrinsic cytotoxic activity of γδ T cells can be enhanced and directed towards cancerous T-ALL cells. In Aim 1,
we will utilize cellular stress modulation by three distinct mechanisms to sensitize T-ALL to γδ T cell-mediated
cytotoxicity, whereas in Aim 2, we will optimize the functionality of CD5-CAR γδ T cells against this disease."

Both childhood asthma and obesity are major public health problems. There is strong evidence of an association
between both diseases; obese children with asthma have increased asthma severity, poor control, and reduced
medication response. Yet, to date, the underpinning mechanisms are not well understood. Our central hypothesis
is that the obese asthma is driven by changes in the epigenetic regulation and transcriptomic activity within
adipose tissue. To test this hypothesis, we will recruit a cohort of children with asthma, obesity, both, or controls,
in whom we will perform extensive phenotyping, and obtain subcutaneous and intra-abdominal adipose tissue.
In addition to BMI, we will assess other indices of adiposity and body composition measured by anthropometry
and impedance analysis. In Specific Aim 1, we will assess the transcriptomic and epigenetic changes in adipose
tissue (using RNA-seq and genome-wide DNA methylation, respectively) associated with obesity and asthma in
this cohort, after adjustment for relevant covariates. Secondary measures will include body composition and
adiposity distribution, and atopy and inflammatory biomarkers. We will then integrate genome-wide genotyping,
DNA methylation, and RNA-seq data via mQTL, eQTL, and eQTM analyses. In Specific Aim 2, we will use the
same approach to evaluate measures of asthma severity and control in children with obesity and asthma. We
will focus on acute exacerbations, Asthma Control Test (ACT) scores, and lung function changes. And in Specific
Aim 3, we will conduct an initial functional/causal validation by assessing differential gene expression in normal
and asthmatic bronchial epithelial and airway smooth muscle cells, in response to treatment with the products of
the top genes identified in Aims 1-2, as well as other candidate genes for obese asthma from the literature. This
proposal innovates by focusing on the “source” tissue of obese asthma, rather than using blood biomarkers or
mediators, and by validating the effect of the top results on the “target” tissues. Elucidating adipose tissue
pathways associated with obese asthma will have critical implications for our understanding of this phenotype
and may allow us to identify ways to improve the management of these patients."

A common feature of nervous systems is that they are initially overpopulated with neurons and over-wired, initially
generating an excessive number of synaptic connections. This is followed by an essential period of remodeling
whereby a subset of extraneous neurons or synaptic connections are removed in order to optimize function in
the adult nervous system. The elimination of cells and pruning of synapses is a process coordinated by neurons
and glia. The selection of specific connections or cells for elimination seems to involve a conversation between
neurons and glia, and the clearance of debris from the nervous system is performed predominantly by phagocytic
glial cells. Previous research has highlighted that the nervous system uses a diversity of molecules and
mechanisms to identify engulfment targets, which appear to be context-specific. However, major gaps still exist
in our knowledge of how neurons identify themselves to be remodeled and how glial cells recognize these dying
or pruning neurons. Studying these processes can potentially lead us to a better understanding of mechanisms
underlying neurodevelopmental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorders and Schizophrenia. Our lab has
employed Drosophila as a model system for several reasons including the powerful genetic tools and the
stereotyped nature of one of its remodeling periods—metamorphosis. Through transcriptomic profiling in
phagocytic astrocytes, I identified the transmembrane immunoglobulin superfamily gene borderless. My
preliminary data suggests that Bdl is highly expressed in astrocytes during engulfment periods early in
metamorphosis. Interestingly, loss of both Borderless (Bdl) and the known engulfment receptor Draper (MEGF10
in mammals) resulted in strong suppression of astrocyte engulfment of synapses and neurites. Bdl has been
described to interact with a closely related protein named Turtle, and my preliminary data further suggests Turtle
is specifically localized to neurites and synapses, and excluded from the cell body (the only compartment of the
cell that astrocytes do not engulf). Turtle may therefore act as a molecular tag for astrocytes to recognize
appropriate engulfment targets. In Aim 1 of this study, I will characterize Bdl expression in astrocytes, explore
genetic interactions between Bdl and Draper, and determine which domains of Bdl are essential for engulfment
activity. In Aim 2, I will 1) define genetic interactions between Bdl, Turtle, and Draper, 2) determine the cell
autonomy of Bdl and Turtle in the remodeling of corazonin neurons and 3) determine the subcellular localization
of Turtle positing me to explore Turtle as a molecular tag for specifying neurites for engulfment. My work has the
potential to define two novel components of the astrocytic engulfment machinery, (Bdl and Turtle), explore how
they converge with Draper/MEGF10, and identify Turtle as a neurite/synapse-specific molecular tag that directly
directs astrocyte engulfment activity. This work will significantly advance our understanding of the molecular
basis of neuron-glia signaling during neuronal remodeling, which will be essential for us to understand and treat
neurodevelopmental disorders in humans."

was incorporated into SCTR upon funding by the CTSA. The long-term goals of the training program are: to train
translational scientists 1) who will choose a lifelong career in biomedical research spanning the interface between
the basic and clinical sciences and 2) who work effectively in interdisciplinary research teams. The program has
four specific aims: 1) Optimize our interdisciplinary training program by providing novel didactic,
experiential and research experiences such that pre-doctoral trainees will be prepared to think both
independently and interdependently (e.g. as members of translational biomedical research teams). 2)
Implement new innovative practical experiences focused on translational research that emphasize team
building, entrepreneurship, and peer mentoring. 3) Augment the translational research skills of the
trainees via the development of a translational research grant application as a required capstone project
incorporating the principles and experiences acquired as a TL1 trainee. This includes developing and
implementing an Individual Development Plan and using the AAMC mentor-mentee training compact. 4) Utilize
a comprehensive evaluation plan incorporating quantitative and qualitative data from multiple sources
to drive program improvement. The program emphasizes rigorous research training experiences coupled with
a combination of didactic courses, practical experiences and team science experiences. The trainees will learn
to work as part of an interdisciplinary team through a combination of courses in team science, a translational
research journal club, translational medicine seminars, a core clinical research training course, interactions with
KL2 scholars and a “Month in the Research Nexus”. During the latter experience, the trainees will learn many
of the aspects of writing and managing a research grant, with an emphasis on translational research. As the
capstone project of the ”Month in the Research Nexus”, trainees write a translational research grant based on
their basic research discoveries. Throughout the program, there is an emphasis on translational research and
team science. The program is designed to provide opportunities for interactions with the full array of SCTR

graduates of this program will become a part of the next generation of translational research scientists who are
proficient in and contribute to a team science approach to solve important research questions."
10816990,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Altered regulation of lipid and glucose homeostasis, most often in the setting of insulin resistance and obesity,
is central to the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Because current management
options remain limited, the discovery of new metabolic pathways will serve to identify novel opportunities for
pharmacologic intervention. This research proposal addresses the unanswered question of whether membrane
phospholipids regulate nutrient homeostasis. Our long-term goal is to understand how phospholipid-mediated
metabolic control can be leveraged for therapeutic purposes. The objective of this research is to determine the
molecular mechanisms whereby sensing of membrane phosphatidylcholines by phosphatidylcholine transfer
protein (PC-TP) is translated into metabolic control by thioesterase superfamily member 2 (Them2), a
mitochondria-associated long chain acyl-CoA thioesterase. The central hypothesis is that key regulatory events
occur in the skeletal muscle when PC-TP binds specific membrane phosphatidylcholine molecular species and
then activates Them2. The rationale is that regulation of skeletal muscle metabolism by Them2 should yield
new insights into hepatic insulin resistance and steatosis. Guided by extensive preliminary data, the central
hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: 1) To demonstrate that Them2 controls lipid and glucose
metabolism in skeletal muscle; 2) To define mechanisms whereby Them2 in skeletal muscle promotes hepatic
steatosis; and 3) To elucidate the molecular determinants of Them2 activity and regulation by PC-TP. In Aim 1,
mouse models will be used to determine mechanisms whereby Them2 regulates fatty acid and glucose
metabolism in skeletal muscle and promotes insulin resistance in response to overnutrition. Cell autonomous
functions of Them2 will be gleaned from systematic studies in cultured myotubes. Aim 2 will establish the
mechanisms in high fat fed mice whereby Them2 in skeletal muscle promotes hepatic insulin resistance and
steatosis. Cultured hepatocytes will be used to determine whether Them2-dependent myokines or extracellular
vesicles released from myotubes control hepatic lipid and glucose metabolism. Aim 3 will determine structural
characteristics that enable Them2 to respond to changes in membrane phosphatidylcholine composition. Small
molecules designed to bind and inhibit Them2 will be used as probes to characterize Them2 function and
interactions with PC-TP using an array of biophysical techniques. Phosphatidylcholine-dependent
conformational changes in PC-TP will be leveraged to identify specific motifs that are critical for Them2 activity
and stability. The interacting domains of Them2 and PC-TP will be identified and confirmed by mutational
analyses. Overall, this proposal will elucidate new mechanisms of phospholipid-mediated metabolic regulation
that control hepatic nutrient metabolism, which is significant because the fatty acyl composition of membrane
phosphatidylcholines varies in health and disease. These studies are expected to establish Them2 as a
tractable target for the management of NAFLD."

 Bacterial cells, despite their relatively small genomes and non-compartmentalized cytoplasm, perform a
variety of complex cellular tasks that are regulated both at the molecular level through canonical biochemical
interactions and at the subcellular level through the spatial organization of molecules. My laboratory is broadly
interested in understanding how the molecular constituents of bacterial cellular processes are spatially organized
and what essential functions such an organization conveys. Our current research focuses on bacterial cell
division, transcription and phage-host interactions using E. coli as a model organism. Specifically, we will (1)
determine the spatial coordination and regulation of the septal cell wall synthase complex FtsWI by FtsZ's
treadmilling dynamics; (2) investigate the spatial organizations of RNA polymerase, essential transcription
factors and chromosomal DNAs and their associated functions; and (3) probe the localization, dynamics and
interactions of phage lysis proteins in cell's envelop. We are uniquely positioned to take on these tasks because
of our extensive expertise in quantitative single molecule imaging and bacterial cell biology. We expect our work
to provide new molecular insight that could be used to develop new strategies to treat bacterial infection."
10818455,"Mammary gland development and function requires precise stage and spatial control of
transcriptional programs. These processes are tightly controlled to ensure the successful function
of the mammary gland, including lactation which is essential for rearing of offspring. Recent work
has demonstrated a role for the E2F transcription factors that goes well beyond their traditional
role in cell cycle regulation. The role of the activator E2Fs (E2F1-3a) is well characterized,
including regulation of mammary gland development. However, little is known of the role of the
repressor E2Fs, E2F4 and E2F5, in the mammary gland and this is partially due to hydrocephaly
and early lethality in the knockout strains. The long term goal of our work is to define the role of
transcriptional regulation in mammary gland development and function. Understanding normal
biology then informs our studies of how this goes awry and results in breast cancer. The
immediate objective of this proposal, which is the next step in our long-term goal, is to precisely
define the role of repressor E2Fs in the mammary gland. Our central hypothesis is that the
repressor E2Fs regulate key mammary gland developmental genes. This hypothesis was based
on preliminary data from knockout mice. Indeed, loss of E2F5 in the mammary epithelium resulted
in delayed ductal extension during puberty, delayed involution and alveolar overgrowth in virgin
adult mice. Loss of E2F4 also resulted in delayed ductal outgrowth but was also associated with
a profound lack of alveolar expansion during pregnancy and lactation. Combining ChIP-Seq data
and our gene expression data, we predicted both unique and shared E2F target genes with
mammary development roles. The rationale for the proposed work is that once we have
completed this proposal, we will understand how transcriptional repression regulates
development of the mammary gland. We plan to test our central hypothesis and accomplish the
objective of this application by investigating the following specific aims. In the first aim we will
characterize the mammary gland phenotypes associated with the mammary epithelial cell specific
knockout of E2F5. In the second aim we will generate ChIP-Seq data and integrate it with E2F5
induced gene expression data to determine E2F5 targets. Target genes will be filtered and
prioritized using additional datasets describing mammary development. Finally, in the third aim
we will examine scRNAseq data in virgin glands lacking E2F3 or E2F5. This proposal is innovative
because it will elucidate the genetic mechanisms regulating mammary gland development and
function by the repressor E2F transcription factors. This contribution is significant because it will
establish a role for E2F5 in mammary gland development."
10934588,"SCI incidence ranges from 250k-500k globally/year, with >7M people impacted. Currently >300k U.S.
individuals live with SCI. SCI results in life-altering consequences in terms of morbidity, mortality, functional
status, employment, and quality of life. For quadriplegics with cervical injuries, even basic ADLs are severely
compromised. Individuals learn assistive strategies for ADLs such as eating, drinking, grooming, functional
bathing, dressing, & toileting. Gaining independence is key factor for quality of life, as adding independent ADLs
contributes to increased self-esteem, confidence, and better mental health. A key feature in many ADLs is access
to water for drinking, washing, & grooming. However, control & delivery form factor of water (On/Off, temperature,
force & angle, and stream/spray type) have different requirements for unique ADLs. Traditional faucets are very
challenging, if not impossible, with high level SCI and limited control degrees of freedom to adjust and control.
 The Access-H2O smart faucet, being developed by Nasoni, LLC, will solve these market challenges by
intelligent sensor integration, automated flow adjustment, intuitive control algorithms, & connected, cloud data
architecture to improve water accessibility for targeted ADLs in SCI. The smart faucet design delivers water
through either traditional downward spout or upward fountain delivery, allowing a single faucet to be used by all
in a household. System design will integrate a sensor network (proximity, voice, camera, & eye gaze sensor)
which can be calibrated based on an individual’s remaining control degrees of freedom. Intelligent algorithm
mapping will allow users to activate and adjust the faucet through various flow and temperature parameters for
a given task. For example, the faucet will automatically adjust to warm, spray, and higher delivery angle for face
washing, as opposed to cold, stream, and lower delivery angle for drinking. Finally, a connected, cloud data
architecture and mobile app will support calibration, usability, remote service, and clinical reporting.
 This project will build on successful Phase I, in which a technical faucet foundation including flow control &
sensors were designed/prototyped, control algorithms verified, & integrated system validated in pilot usability.
This Phase II will expand that foundation with five overall Aims. 1) Optimize the current faucet design will be for
form factor and sensor integration, as well as technically verified at the system level. 2) Enhance water control
algorithms with expanded features, while novel diagnostic algorithms & connected digital ecosystem drive
usability & support. 3) The enhanced platform will be tested for in clinic usability in the SCI target population. 4)
Transition the design to formal manufacturing process to ensure that design meets performance standards and
regulatory requirements and to produce pre-production prototypes for testing 5) Conduct in-home clinical trial to
demonstrate effectiveness of Access H2O smart sensor faucet."

Preeclampsia is a complication affecting 2 – 8% of all pregnancies and results in significant
maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. The invention to be researched in this grant
detects preeclampsia and hypertension in patients with the phones that they already own. It
improves outcomes by increasing access to care among underserved populations and
monitoring frequency among high risk patients. Patients record themselves using their own
phones which takes only a few minutes. The long term objective is to commercialize a product
which enables any of 7 billion phones to assist in preeclampsia or gestational hypertension
detection.
The invention is intended to be used at home by patients via a phone app with results sent to
the prescribing obstetrician (OB). The purpose is to alert the OB if immediate physical
examination is needed and to initiate possible preeclampsia management protocol. In these
situations, there are no other comparable testing options.
The invention includes both improvements to clinical practice and to science. Current clinical
practice standard of care requires patients to be examined in an OB office. The invention
allows preeclampsia and hypertension to be detected via patient self-examination from
locations outside the OB office. This improves upon current technology such as home blood
pressure cuffs and in-office dipstick urinalysis. In terms of improvements to science, the
invention consists of both a Universal Translator (UT) and Deductive Intelligence (DI). UT
allows for any mobile phone to capture body acoustic data. DI is a novel physics based
approach to creating classifier algorithms from passively received time series data, such as
mobile phone recordings received from the UT. The invention analyzes hemodynamics and
extracts pertinent physics based features from which a classifier algorithm is based.
This will be the third large scale human study that demonstrates classification of cardio -
pulmonary functionality. It follows a published study on COVID detection as well as a study
under peer review on the ability to reproduce echocardiogram estimates of ejection fraction.
The echocardiogram study establishes the protocol to be used in the proposed research. In
a recent preliminary study, 46 pregnant women were recorded at the aortic site. The resulting
model was able to determine which patients had high blood pressure and to accurately
determine which patients had complications. These studies support our hypothesis that
acoustic hemodynamic data captured by OEM phone microphones, at the aortic auscultation
site and at the upper arm, can be used to identify patients who have preeclampsia and/or
hypertension.
The study has two primary aims. The first is to demonstrate proof of concept that the invention
enables ordinary mobile phones to reproduce physicians’ diagnosis of pre-eclampsia. The
second aim is to demonstrate proof of concept that the invention enables ordinary mobile
phones to reproduce cuff measurements of blood pressure and to detect hypertension. The
approach is based on recruitment from both outpatient clinics and inpatient hospital settings.
Patients already labeled with preeclampsia or high blood pressure will be enrolled as well as
control patients without disease conditions. Patients will be recorded by clinicians with a
custom phone app. Algorithms will be developed based on these recordings using UT and
DI. Results will be tested and analyzed using AUC, sensitivity/specificity, accuracy as well
adj RSQ for the linear regression analysis.
The team consists of a broad range of talent including the inventor of the technology, the
Maternal Fetal Medicine Division Director at the hospital, the research director of emergency
medicine for the hospital running the tests, statistical expertise, and project management."

 Our application aims to develop a blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetrating erythropoietin (EPO) as a therapeutic
for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and continues to pursue our long-term goal to develop BBB-penetrable biologics
for central nervous system (CNS) diseases, especially for AD. The rationale to develop EPO as a therapeutic
for AD lies in its ability to modulate several pathways implicated in AD pathogenesis, and its neuroprotective and
neuroregenerative effects. Such a strategy can delay or prevent new brain damage from occurring and potentially
reverse neuronal damage and cognitive decline; anti-Aβ antibodies do not offer such neurotrophic effects. The
main obstacles to the clinical translation of EPO for AD are limited BBB penetration and undesired hematopoiesis
with chronic high EPO doses. For this, we have used a clinically validated BBB drug delivery approach and fused
EPO with a monoclonal antibody (MAb) against the mouse transferrin receptor (TfR) which enters the brain via
BBB TfR-mediated transcytosis and is also rapidly cleared from the systemic circulation owing to the peripheral
TfRs; the latter is expected to minimize hematopoietic side-effects. Our exciting data shows that TfRMAb-EPO
is therapeutic in both a mouse model of amyloidosis and tauopathy. Our proof-of-concept work also shows that
TfRMAb-EPO indeed offers better therapeutic and hematologic indices than EPO in AD mice, however, there
are fundamental questions pertaining to the dose-response, therapeutic-time window, and the safety of TfRMAb-
EPO, that still remain unanswered. Further, a comprehensive investigation of the molecular pathways modulated
by TfRMAb-EPO in the AD brain has not been performed. Based on this, we hypothesize that TfRMAb-EPO is
a disease-modifying therapeutic for AD with better therapeutic and hematologic indices than EPO following
chronic dosing. Therefore, to advance the preclinical development of TfRMAb-EPO for AD, the following specific
aims will be pursued: Aim 1 will determine the efficacy of TfRMAb-EPO in dose-escalation studies, Aim 2 will
examine the safety of TfRMAb-EPO in dose-escalation studies, and Aim 3 will elucidate the molecular pathways
involved in the therapeutic effects of TfRMAb-EPO. We will perform dose-escalation studies in three AD-relevant
mouse models: amyloid precursor protein (APP) overexpressing Aβ mice (APP/PS1), in mice that combine tau
and Aβ pathology (3xTg), and in APPSAA knock-in mice that model AD without APP overexpression. The effect
on key AD pathogenic events (Aβ and tau, microgliosis, neuronal loss, and behavioral deficits), along with an
investigation of TfRMAb-, EPO-, biopharmaceutical- and AD-related adverse events will be studied in young and
aged AD mice. Finally, to gain insights into the molecular pathways modulated by TfRMAb-EPO in the AD brain,
spatial proteomics will be performed. Therefore, Aims 1 and 2 will establish the therapeutic range and time
window of TfRMAb-EPO while Aim 3 will provide mechanistic insights. Overall, the proposal, backed by a strong
scientific premise and data, will provide a clinically feasible and safe approach for sustainable EPO delivery to
the AD brain by utilizing state-of-the-art techniques and mouse models."
10820679,"Mechanisms of Heterochromatic Transcriptional Gene Silencing
Project Summary / Abstract
Heterochromatin plays a crucial role in the repression of transposons, genome stability, and cell differentiation
through its ability to silence DNA transcription. How heterochromatin represses transcription by RNA polymerase
II (Pol II) is an open question. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, histone three lysine 9 di- and tri-methyl (H3K9me)
bearing heterochromatic loci accomplish transcriptional silencing by recruiting the Heterochromatin Protein 1
(HP1) homologs Swi6 and Chp2. Together, HP1swi6/chp2 proteins induce chromatin compaction, recruit
downstream factors such as histone deacetylases (HDAC) and chromatin remodelers, and promote nascent
RNA decay. Previous studies have unraveled the mechanisms responsible for processing and degrading
nascent RNA transcripts. However, the mechanism(s) by which heterochromatin inhibits Pol II activity, referred
to as transcriptional gene silencing (TGS), is not fully understood. In the proposed work, I explore the following
questions: Which HP1swi6/chp2 functions are sufficient for TGS and what is the mechanism of HP1swi6/chp2 mediated
TGS? I hypothesize that HP1swi6/chp2 mediates TGS through distinct activities: intrinsic nonspecific DNA binding,
liquid-liquid phase separation formation, and the downstream recruitment of histone deacetylase and remodeling
activities. To test this hypothesis, I will 1) identify which Swi6 functions are necessary for heterochromatic TGS
using HP1swi6/chp2 mutant strains, 2) identify activities downstream of HP1swi6/chp2 that are sufficient for
heterochromatic TGS by direct recruitment of proteins to H3K9me loci in cells lacking recruitment of downstream
factors, and 3) Identify the specific transcriptional stage inhibited by HP1swi6/chp2 by characterizing the proteome
of heterochromatic and euchromatic ectopic locus. Achieving these aims would contribute to understanding the
mechanisms of gene regulation and transposon repression. In addition, mechanistic knowledge of
heterochromatic TGS could help treat diseases associated with heterochromatin defects."

Retrotransposable elements (RTEs) are genomic elements that have the ability to “copy-and-paste” themselves
into new locations within the genome. RTE mobilization can cause mutations and genomic instability. Many
cellular mechanisms exist to repress RTE activity. Interestingly, it has been observed that neural stem and
progenitor cells (NSPCs) show high levels of RTE activity. However, it is currently unknown whether this RTE
activity is essential for normal development of the brain. Further, abnormally high RTE activity has been
associated with a number of neurodevelopmental disorders. Causative roles for RTE expression and mobilization
in neurodevelopmental disorders have not been identified. The long term objectives of this proposal are to
understand whether RTE activation is necessary for normal development and whether RTE inhibition is a viable
treatment for neurodevelopmental disorders. In my first specific aim, I will test the impact RTE expression and
mobilization has on Drosophila brain development and on cerebral organoid development. Drosophila and
cerebral organoids will be treated with Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) to prevent RTE
activity. Single-cell RNA sequencing will reveal the cell-type specific differences between control models and
models treated with NRTIs. In my second aim, I will investigate the mechanism by which unrestricted RTE activity
can cause microcephaly. Preliminary data shows increased NSPC death in a Drosophila model of microcephaly.
I will determine whether this is true in multiple other microcephaly models and determine if DNA damage caused
by RTE activation in Drosophila microcephaly models leads to the NSPC death observed. The proposed
research will illuminate the role of RTE activity during neurodevelopment. Importantly, it will also provide crucial
information to inform whether inhibition of RTEs during development is a viable therapeutic for microcephaly and
other neurodevelopmental diseases that are caused by RTEs, thus prompting future pre-clinical studies."
10799643,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Behavioral obesity treatments can produce clinically significant weight loss but are often too costly or intensive
to be implemented on a large scale. Standalone digital health interventions offer greater scalability than
traditional in-person approaches, but produce only modest weight loss. To maximize efficacy, it is vital to
determine the “active ingredients” of an intervention and eliminate the ineffective, or even detrimental, ones.
Self-monitoring is a core component of behavioral obesity treatment that can be delivered via digital tools, yet
little is known about the unique and combined impact of different self-monitoring strategies. The K23
candidate, Dr. Michele Patel, will address this gap by applying an innovative framework – the Multiphase
Optimization Strategy (MOST) – to identify the most potent combination of digital self-monitoring strategies for
weight loss. As the first part of this programmatic line of research, Dr. Patel will conduct a 6-month optimization
trial that randomizes 176 adults with overweight/obesity to 0-3 self-monitoring components (tracking dietary
intake, physical activity, and/or body weight) using a full factorial design. This study will leverage existing
commercial platforms for self-monitoring, including a mobile app, wearable activity monitor, and wireless
electronic scale. All participants will also receive an empirically- and theory-informed core weight loss
intervention that includes goal setting, weekly tailored feedback, action plans, and behavioral skills training –
components that enhance engagement and are well-supported by prior research. Aim 1a will examine the
optimal combination of self-monitoring strategies that maximizes 6-month weight loss while Aim 1b will
examine self-monitoring engagement and its association with weight loss. Aim 2 will evaluate barriers to and
facilitators of engaging in these self-monitoring strategies, which will be assessed via semi-structured
qualitative interviews with 40 trial participants. Aim 3 will assess a novel, interactive recruitment strategy via an
embedded trial. Together, results will inform an R01 grant that evaluates the newly optimized intervention in an
RCT. Building on Dr. Patel’s background in clinical trial methodology and behavioral obesity treatment, the
proposed career development award will provide substantive training in 1) MOST and factorial designs; 2)
qualitative and mixed methods research; 3) innovative recruitment and retention strategies; and 4) preparation
for the transition into independent research. To facilitate successful completion of these goals, Stanford
University’s outstanding environment for interdisciplinary research will be coupled with a highly-qualified, well-
rounded mentorship team comprised of Primary Mentor Dr. Abby King, Co-mentors Dr. Gary Bennett and Dr.
Lisa Rosas, and Consultants Mr. John Gallis (biostatistician) and Dr. Linda Collins (developer of MOST). This
K23 will position Dr. Patel to become a leader in optimizing digital interventions for weight loss and will launch
her career as an independent investigator dedicated to treating obesity through innovative solutions."

Recurrence from early-stage (stage I/II) primary melanomas, often undetected until symptomatic metastasis,
accounts for most melanoma mortality. Current prognostic tools are inadequate to identify patients at high risk
of recurrence and metastasis at the time of diagnosis, limiting the ability to provide improved surveillance and
personalized treatment. Additionally, biological mechanisms driving early-stage melanoma recurrence remain
understudied, as previous studies have extensively focused on advanced melanomas. I hypothesize that the
states, interactions, and spatial relationships of cells within the melanoma microenvironment, as well as
transcriptomic signatures, play a critical role in early-stage melanoma recurrence and can further inform
predictive models. To test this hypothesis, I propose to leverage recent advances in multiplexed tissue imaging,
spatial transcriptomics, and artificial intelligence to robustly quantify known prognostic factors, discover new
biomarkers, and develop explainable machine-learning models for predicting early-stage melanoma recurrence.
The integration of clinical, histopathologic, and multiplexed imaging single-cell data will facilitate the development
of accurate and reliable prognostic tools, which can be deployed in clinical settings following independent
validation. In Aim 1 (K99), I will develop computational approaches to identify and quantify both known prognostic
features and novel biomarkers through multi-modal analyses of multiplexed imaging and spatial transcriptomic
data. In Aim 2 (K99), using an efficient multi-modal imaging method, I will generate multiplexed and conventional
histopathologic hematoxylin and eosin-stained images of the same tissue section for a large cohort and integrate
them with electronic health records to build interpretable machine-learning models for predicting melanoma
recurrence. In Aim 3 (R00), I will validate the machine learning models in an independent cohort and apply the
pipeline for stage III melanoma recurrence and other cancer settings. My Ph.D. in computer science and ongoing
postdoctoral training in computational biology, genomics, and biomedical informatics put me in a unique position
to accomplish this proposed research. During the K99 phase, I will be supported by an outstanding and

in computational cancer biology, professional skills, and leadership vital to transition into an independent position
and establish a highly impactful laboratory, focusing on the development of computational methodologies to
systematically decipher mechanisms of cancer development and progression."
10796378,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Coronary revascularization (CR) is a standard interventional treatment for patients with symptomatic stable
coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the performance of such interventions without appropriate patient
selection is not superior to medical therapy alone. Consequently, to achieve enhanced patient selection, many
have advocated for physiological/anatomical information integration of myocardial functions and coronary
arteries before the CR. As a result, we aim to develop enabling technologies allowing for comprehensive and
quantitative assessments of myocardial functions and coronary arteries. Leveraging the proposed technologies,
an interventional cardiologist can identify the most appropriate lesions to treat using CR, impacting the
management of patients with CAD.
This project first combines gated SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) with invasive coronary angiography
(ICA). Then, machine-learning-based methods can reliably interpret the fusion results to support clinical decision-
making. Studies have already demonstrated that CR decisions based on MPI improve outcomes over anatomical
assessment or medical therapy alone. Once ICA is combined, the SPECT-ICA fusion map provides
complementary information about both myocardial functions (perfusion and wall motion) and coronary arteries
(anatomy and assessments of stenosis). Technological developments in the PI’s lab demonstrate it is feasible
to fuse MPI with ICA data. Our recent clinical validation showed that: the number of coronary stenosis segments
with uncertainty was significantly reduced by our 3D SPECT-ICA fusion compared with side-by-side analysis;
patients who received CR congruent with guidance by 3D fusion had superior outcomes when compared with
those who did not.
In this proposal, using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, further technological developments improve
the clinical utility of our software system. More specifically, our primary objectives are twofold. First, we use
machine-learning-based ICA image processing to reduce our technologies' processing time and minimize user
variabilities, making clinical translation feasible. Second, we improve the result interpretation of the SPECT-ICA
fusion map using machine-learning methods. More specifically, a 3D SPECT-ICA fusion map can be generated
for each patient after multimodality fusion. A new model using the latest reinforcement learning techniques will
enhance the interpretation of the SPECT-ICA fusion map and further improve CR outcomes. It is important to
note that all the new algorithms and techniques will receive rigorous validations. A retrospective single-center
study in a cath lab will be conducted to identify further clinical values of our fusion approach in guiding the CR.
Completion of this proposal will not only advance the clinical translation of technologies developed in the PI’s
lab, improving the clinical decision-making for patients under consideration for CR, but also enhance Michigan
Tech’s research profile by introducing translational cardiology to our students."
10796455,"Project Summary/Abstract
Skeletal muscle mass loss during cancer cachexia is one of the most important predictors of poor prognosis
and mortality among cancer patients. However, the role played by skeletal muscle mass in the survival of
cancer patients has been understood as a mere symptom of poor overall body health. Contrary to this notion,
recent studies have demonstrated that skeletal muscle has an independent and active role in improving
survival among cancer patients. Proof-of-principle investigations have shown that promoting skeletal muscle
mass, for instance by blocking myostatin signaling, can increase lifespan in tumor-bearing mice independently
of any effect of the drug on tumor volume. Therefore, understanding the mechanism regulating muscle size
can lead to better therapeutic targets to improve health outcomes among advanced cancer patients.
Ribosome biogenesis, the de novo synthesis of ribosomes, is a key process determining protein synthesis in
skeletal muscle. While there has been great attention recently to the roles of muscle ribosome biogenesis in
regulating muscle hypertrophy, the roles of muscle ribosome biogenesis to maintain muscle mass and during
muscle atrophy are largely unknown. We have generated a mouse strain in which we can lower ribosome
biogenesis specifically and conditionally in skeletal muscle. We crossed the Upstream Binding Factor (UBF, a
key transcriptional factor important for ribosomal DNA transcriptional) floxed mouse to the muscle specific
human α-skeletal actin (HSA) promoter linked to a CRE recombinase (HSA-MCM). Using this mouse model to
reduce UBF levels in adult muscles only (which we termed UBF mKO), we showed impairing muscle ribosome
biogenesis causes muscle atrophy particularly in type IIb and IIx myofibers, while Type I and IIa fibers are not
affected. Unexpectedly, long-term experiments using the UBF mKO mice demonstrated that impaired muscle
ribosome biogenesis have severe consequences to muscle and whole-body metabolism that phenocopied
cancer cachexia, including high respiratory exchange ratio (RER) and depletion of adipose tissue. With our
reversed engineered mouse model, we were able to recreate cancer cachexia from within muscle, challenging
the assumption that skeletal muscle wasting in cancer cachexia is a mere effect of systemic disease. Rather,
our preliminary data strongly suggest that cachexia in the whole body can be initiated in skeletal muscle. This
proposal seeks to investigate the mechanism of muscle wasting via skeletal muscle and to identify the
mechanism leading to overall cachectic phenotype. If our hypothesis is correct, this will be the first evidence
that muscle wasting in cachexia can be recreated from within the muscle tissue and that muscle ribosome
biogenesis could be a target to mitigate or even abolish cancer cachexia altogether."

TETmedical Inc. is developing a tethered enzyme technology (TET) for rapid point-of-care (PoC) and/or at-home
testing of liver enzyme levels, enabling convenient and timely tracking of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) and
other sources of liver damage. When the liver is damaged or diseased, the enzymes aspartate aminotransferase
(AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are released into the blood, making these the most frequently used
markers of hepatocellular injury. Because the liver is the primary site of drug metabolism, patients’ AST and ALT
levels are often evaluated to monitor DILI as a key component of clinical trials to determine drug safety. Currently,
to have the test performed, patients must travel to a clinic to have a blood sample drawn, which is then tested in
an in-house laboratory or mailed off to a central laboratory testing facility. Visits to the clinic place a burden on
the elderly and/or those with limited mobility, and add a geographic constraint to clinical trial participants,
reducing the diversity of subjects. The testing process is slow, burdensome, and costly, and severely limits the
frequency of testing and the speed with which a problem can be detected. In response to this need, TETmedical
is advancing a simple, rapid, and affordable test for AST/ALT measurement that can be performed at the PoC
or in the patient’s own home based on a biomimetic approach to oriented immobilization of enzymes on
nanoparticles (NPs). This method significantly improves the efficiency of coupled enzymatic reactions and is
based on the TET platform that enables ultra-rapid, highly sensitive, and quantitative detection of analytes. Of
note, TETmedical has enabled luminescence readouts of AST/ALT in the highly reducing environment of human
serum/plasma, thus overcoming a challenge that prevented luminescent quantification of AST/ALT.
TETmedical’s AST/ALT test will include disposable cartridges with the TET biosensor embedded on a paper-
based blood separator and, due to a recent partnership, a lancet based blood sample collection device to enable
repeated at-home testing of liver enzymes. Once the sample is added to the cartridge, it will then be inserted
into an electronic reader that will measure the luminescence-based readout and provide a quantitative result.
For this Phase I project, TETmedical’s Specific Aims are: 1) Optimize the tethered enzyme assays for detection
of AST and ALT including the speed, range of detection, and calibration of luminescence outputs, 2) Improve
separation of blood components and design of cartridges, and 3) Validate technology using spiked human blood
samples. Completion of these Aims will result in a cartridge integrating blood separation and TET biosensors to
quantify AST and ALT, and controls for hemolysis, which are already under development. This will provide the
necessary proof of concept for a future Phase II application, which will include a validation study in clinical
samples, integration with the at-home blood collection device, and further development of the prototype
electronic reader device, enabling simple PoC or at-home use."
10822338,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is one of only a small number of diseases classified as potentially
eradicable. In 1997, the World Health Assembly passed a resolution to eliminate LF as a public
health problem and the approach involved yearly concurrent mass drug administration (MDA)
to the at-risk population in 52 countries. According to the WHO, about 856 million people are
at-risk of acquiring LF and need annual MDA treatment. After over 17 years of MDA to the at-
risk population and spending several billion dollars, the incidence of LF infection has not
significantly declined. This is likely due to subject non-compliance and lack of effectiveness of
the drugs against the adult parasites living within the lymphatic system. Thus, reliance on the
drug therapy approach alone is ineffective in limiting disease transmission. In fact,
chemotherapy only treats current infections and does not prevent future re-infections leaving
the patients susceptible to the disease. Several recent studies show that the disease is re-
emerging in several parts of the world. Therefore, there is a critical need for developing an
effective prophylactic vaccine that can support the current MDA approach for preventing
disease transmission and total elimination of the disease from endemic regions.
Unlike most other infectious organisms such as viruses, bacteria or protozoa, the lymphatic
filarial parasites do not replicate within their definitive hosts. Therefore, the prophylactic
vaccine against LF need not induce sterilizing immunity to be effective for controlling the
infection. In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) has determined that helminth vaccines
that can prevent worm establishment by 50% will be effective in reducing overall morbidity and
mortality.
Over the last 2 decades, several vaccine candidates were identified and tested for their
therapeutic potential against LF in rodent models. However, none of these candidates
advanced beyond rodent testing - partially because of poor protection and/or lack of resources
to advance the technology. We have developed and established the first successful multivalent
recombinant fusion protein vaccine (BmHAXT) for the prophylaxis of LF. The vaccine gives
close to sterile immunity in rodents and significant protection in non-human primates (70%)
when given along with a TLR4 agonist adjuvant. BmHAXT is now ready to move clinical
development. Thus, the major focus of this project is to perform the remaining IND enabling
activities including (Aim 1) the CMC activities required for regulatory submission and
demonstrating stability of the human use product, (Aim 2) the preclinical animal testing to
confirm that the newly manufactured LFguard™ vaccine maintains its potency in experimental
animal models and that it is safe in a GLP toxicology study, and finally, (Aim 3) write the clinical
and supporting documents and submitting the IND."
10820362,"Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection. In the U.S., women
aged 15-24 have the highest CT burden: 782,697 cases in 2019. Up to 80% of urogenital CT infections are
asymptomatic, and untreated persistent infection can cause pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and ectopic
pregnancy. Risk of reproductive sequelae rises with duration of CT persistence, likely due to chronic inflammation
in the fallopian tubes. In contrast, untreated CT can spontaneously clear without antibiotic use. Clearance rate
estimates vary: it appears 7-44% of women clear CT between testing and initiating treatment (~1-2 weeks), but
mechanisms of this natural resolution are poorly understood. Studies show spontaneous clearance may reduce
reinfection, and antibiotics may impede development of lasting immunity. We have strong preliminary data that
bacterial vaginosis, a condition characterized by a low-Lactobacillus vaginal microbiota, is associated with CT
persistence. This project will further identify specific features of the vaginal metagenome and immune
milieu that contribute to spontaneous CT clearance and assess if these features differ by infection
duration. Antibiotic-sparing approaches to promote CT clearance will offer the most protection from reproductive
sequelae when clearance is rapid and occurs early in infection. The proposed work will leverage a unique set of
cervicovaginal lavage samples from a large longitudinal study (n=1,053 samples, n=431 women). Quarterly
samples were collected for 1 year. Due to historical reasons, a majority of the samples were screened for CT at
study end. We identified 310 spontaneous clearance events: 247 were rapid and 63 delayed. Clearance events
were matched to control persistence events on infection duration. This proposal focuses on epidemiologically
robust analyses of the vaginal metagenome and immune milieu at CT+ visits (before clearance) to identify
features that may functionally contribute to clearance. Specific aims will evaluate whether the following are
associated with spontaneous CT clearance and if associations differ by infection duration: (1) species- and strain-
specific vaginal bacteria growth rates, (2) interplay of Th1 and Th17 immune responses, and (3) interactions
between the vaginal metagenome and immune milieu. Bacterial growth rates may reflect metabolic activity and
allow identification of bacteria that functionally contribute to CT clearance. Spontaneous clearance is likely
mediated by IFNγ and Th1 immune responses; Th17 responses may promote persistence and pathology.
However, data suggest IFNγ’s role in clearance may depend on timing and duration of its production, and Th17
and Th1 responses may regulate each other. The microbiome and host constantly interact, and multi-omic
analyses of microbiome and host immune data can yield insights that are missed in single-omic analyses. This
work will highlight potential targets to promote rapid CT clearance, which can be validated in vitro and translated
into interventions. It will also inform CT vaccine design by characterizing immune responses that promote rapid
clearance. This F32 will provide postdoctoral training in metagenomic, immune marker, and multi-omic analyses."
10822184,"ABSTRACT
Inorganic arsenic (iAs) is an environmentally ubiquitous toxin that affects >100 million people worldwide, with
health consequences ranging from acute toxicity to cancer. While iAs exposure can generate reactive oxygen
species that damage DNA, a significant fraction of iAs-induced disease cannot be attributed to DNA lesions. We
previously showed that iAs exposure remodels DNA and histone epigenetic marks in iAs-induced oncogenesis,
and now know that iAs exposure also alters higher-order (3-dimensional, or 3D) chromatin structure. One of
those structures involves a dynamic link between chromatin and the inner nuclear matrix, which brings distal
genes into proximity with one another. This link is maintained by the SATB proteins; is necessary for proper gene
regulation during cellular differentiation; and is disrupted by iAs exposure. SATB1 is a known oncogene, whereas
SATB2 can either act as an oncogene or tumor suppressor depending on the cell type and gene environment.
We recently discovered that during iAs-induced oncogenesis, SATB2 is upregulated and produces a novel,
circular RNA (circSATB2) that “protects” linear SATB2 mRNA from degradation, possibly by interfering with a
microRNA (miR31). The circSATB2 RNA is translated into a peptide (circSATB2p), and this peptide alters the
native SATB2 interactome and gene expression profile. These data support the idea that transcriptional and
post-translational, temporal control over SATB2 and chromatin higher-order structures are critical for
coordinating normal cellular differentiation. They suggest that SATB2 is regulated by a novel circRNA-miRNA-
mRNA regulatory axis. The objective of this project is therefore to determine exactly how iAs exposure regulates
SATB2 expression and activity to promote oncogenesis. In Aim 1, we will test how SATB2 is regulated
transcriptionally (via the circRNA-miR-mRNA pathway) and post-transcrionally (via regulation of the protein). In
Aim 2, we will test how circSATB2p and SATB2 differentially regulate the 3D genome organization and nuclear
integrity, and in Aim 3, we will test the role of circSATB2 in metastasis and tumorigenesis. These studies will
identify the circSATB2-mirRNA-SATB2 gene regulatory axis, and establish that a novel SATB2 isoform switch
drives iAs-induced oncogenesis. The mechanistic understanding of how iAs affects 3D chromatin structure and
nuclear integrity will elucidate key (and novel) processes in chromatin biology, and contribute to a framework for
developing diagnostics and targeted therapeutics for iAs-induced disease."
10934378,"Disparities in cancer survivorship are persistent and pervasive. Obesity, medical comorbidities, second primary
cancers, poor quality of life and compromised physical functioning, disproportionately affect African American
(AA) cancer survivors. There is strong evidence that physical activity (PA) has the potential to eliminate these
disparities. Yet, insufficient PA is more prevalent among AA cancer survivors and 76% do not meet PA
guidelines. Efforts to increase PA longer term in cancer survivors have been modestly successful. The extant
literature and our own preliminary data in cancer survivors shows that PA adoption is often followed by an
attenuation of PA over time. These findings have led to a recent shift in thinking, specifically that the social
cognitive theory constructs (e.g., self-efficacy), important for PA adoption play less of a role in PA
maintenance. Additional theoretical constructs (i.e., habit and identity) may be the key constructs necessary for
long term behavior change. Conceivably, lack of success in promoting PA maintenance may also be due to
few studies examining how well health behavior change interventions work in the broader societal context. For
example, for AAs, discrimination is a potent social determinant of health. Discrimination is prevalent (reported
by 82% of AA breast cancer survivors), disproportionate (AAs are more likely to report discrimination-related
stress compared to other racial and ethnic groups), and stressful (stress, in general, impedes PA). Despite this
evidence, the effect of discrimination on PA intervention outcomes is unknown. Thus, to advance PA
maintenance science with a focus on a vulnerable population, we propose testing two potentially translatable
PA maintenance promotion interventions (Short Message Service [SMS] and peer coach) in 260 physically
inactive AA women cancer survivors using a rigorous, randomized 2 x 2 factorial experimental design.
Survivors will complete a 3-month PA adoption phase (i.e., efficacious theory-based PA behavior change
program) prior to randomization to a PA maintenance promotion intervention or usual care. Our 6-month SMS
and peer coach PA maintenance promotion interventions will be guided by the Multi-Process Action Control
(M-PAC) framework which includes constructs which are understudied in cancer survivors yet hypothesized to
be important for PA maintenance (e.g., habit, identity). Assessments will occur at baseline (pre-PA adoption), 3
months (post-PA adoption; immediately prior to randomization), 9 months, and 15 months. Our specific aims
are: 1) Determine effects of both PA maintenance interventions (SMS, peer coach) compared to usual care on
PA maintenance (i.e., main effects and if either intervention effects differ in the presence of the other); 2)
Identify theory-based mediators of PA maintenance; and 3) Determine if discrimination moderates intervention
effects on PA maintenance. The project will generate new knowledge about the mechanisms underlying PA
maintenance and provide insight about the impact of discrimination on intervention effects thus leading to more
effective behavioral interventions that will improve health outcomes and reduce health disparities."
10822273,"Project Summary
Influenza remains a global health challenge. There is a pressing need for next-generation vaccines that can
protect against a broad range of influenza subtypes, particularly those of pandemic potential (e.g., H5, H7).
Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are two surface glycoproteins, which facilitate virion binding and
egress, respectively. While contemporary influenza vaccines are not standardized for NA, recent studies have
underscored the importance of NA-directed antibodies in influenza protection. However, relative to HA, the
immunodominance of NA and its evolutionary response to immune pressure remain largely uncharacterized.
Furthermore, whether an NA-based immunogen(s) can focus the humoral response to conserved sites on NA
has yet to be determined. The NA catalytic site (CS) cleaves sialic acid to enable viral egress and is conserved
amongst NA subtypes. Here, I hypothesize that structure-guided immunogen design can focus the immune
response to the conserved NA CS and augment anti-NA antibody breadth. To elicit a focused, CS-directed
immune response, I will pursue two approaches. 1) l will engineer glycans on the NA periphery to mask variable
epitopes, leaving the conserved CS exposed. 2) I will graft the conformationally complex CS onto antigenically
distinct scaffolds to enrich the CS epitope relative to other epitopes. To elicit broader anti-NA immunity and
augment CS-directed B cell activation, I will increase NA valency using protein linkers and nanoparticle platforms.
I will then test the effects of these NA immunogens in vivo and characterize the resulting serum, germinal center,
and memory B cell repertoires. I further hypothesize that focused anti-NA immunity will complement focused
anti-HA immunity to restrict influenza escape pathways. After passaging an influenza strain with anti-HA
antibodies, anti-NA antibodies, or both, I will characterize viral escape mutants and compare growth kinetics
relative to the wildtype strain. The data generated from this proposal will elucidate the effectiveness of the
proposed immune-focusing strategies as a general approach to vaccine design and particularly inform the
optimization of NA immunogens for next-generation influenza vaccines. These results will also advance our
understanding of NA antigenicity and evolvability."

Sostos, LLC has developed a qRT-PCR-based microfluidic 7-gene assay (CATOS-LU) that predicts recurrence
or progression to metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a patient who has undergone resection
for stage 1 cancer without high-risk features at the time of surgical intervention. In retrospective/archived
longitudinal clinical studies, our assay, which was developed utilizing novel artificial intelligence (AI) methods
and validated via our qRT-PCR, next-generation sequencing (NGS), and proteomics, accurately predicted 1) the
risk of tumor recurrence in early-stage NSCLC patients (n>1,600) including patients from a randomized phase
III clinical trial JBR.10 (ClinicalTrials.gov); and 2) the clinical benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy in these patients.
These results support that our technology can 1) identify early-stage NSCLC at high risk for tumor recurrence,
and 2) predict the clinical benefits of chemotherapy in stage 1 NSCLC without high-risk features for earlier
implementation of adjuvant chemotherapy in the course of disease management beyond the current standard of
care. We have accomplished several key milestones to help demonstrate early proof-of-concept during the initial
development of our product. We have submitted a set of comprehensive patent applications to strengthen our
IP for our technology, addressing the clinical utility of CATOS-LU in patient snap-frozen and formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumors, which we have also discussed with the FDA. To help commercialize our
technology, we intend to optimize CATOS-LU in FFPE clinical samples to better fit within the
surgery/pathology/oncology workflow. In this Phase I SBIR project, we will establish a qRT-PCR assay, based
upon our AI-defined 7-gene panel, focusing on stage 1 NSCLC without high-risk features (n=200), for the
prediction of the recurrence risk. To enhance the clinical application and market value of our CATOS-LU within
the standard of diagnostic care, we will develop our CATOS-LU of FFPE tumors in a CAP-accredited laboratory.
The project will test the feasibility of integrating our proposed qRT-PCR assay of FFPE tumors into the existing
hospital workflows for cost-effective in-house testing. The proposed data analysis will follow the FDA instructions
that we have received and the results generated from this project will be submitted to the agency for approval.
We have engaged strategic partners, including a commitment to match this project pending the award of Phase
I. We request Phase I support to test the feasibility of our project and optimize our test to aid physicians in
identifying these high-risk patients in the earliest stages of NSCLC. Ultimately, we intend to obtain CMS
coverage/reimbursement as an LDT followed by FDA approval of our diagnostic test as an aid to diagnosis or
risk score assessment for patients at high risk of recurrence of NSCLC in stage 1 without high-risk features
following primary tumor resection."
10821732,"Abstract
 Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia in older adults, is a neurodegenerative
disorder characterized by progressive decline of memory and cognition. AD is multifaceted and heterogeneous,
which prevents clear mechanistic understanding of AD pathogenesis and therefore hinders development of
effective therapeutics. Meanwhile, post-mortem epidemiology indicated that AD onset was associated with
elevated activity of the histone methyltransferase G9a (EHMT2) in diseased brain,
implicating
G9a activity-
associated pathways in AD pathogenesis. Using our c
hromatin-activity-based chemoproteomic (ChaC)
approach that enables dissection of AD heterogeneity
, we (the Chen lab) have discovered a noncanonical,
translation regulatory function of G9a in AD pathogenesis. Further, we deduced the mechanism of action of a
brain-penetrant G9a-targetd drug,
MS1262,
w
here G9a inhibition by MS1262 reversed
AD patient proteomes,
particularly the AD-disturbed expression or phosphorylation of proteins related to cognition and learning, synaptic
transmission, synaptogenesis, and hyperactive behavior. Correspondingly, intermittent
MS1262 treatment
restored cognitive and affective functions in mid/late-stage 5xFAD mice to the healthy level (p <0.0027). Thus,
we will develop a new mechanism-based AD therapeutics. TransChromix, LLC, a startup company created by
the NC Kick-Start program, and Professor Xian Chen at the UNC School of Medicine, will conduct this project.
 Our preliminary results show that MS1262 therapy of AD is clinically practical: Comparison of proteomic
analyses of MS1262-treated AD mice with human data from large cohorts of AD patients revealed that MS1262
reversed the patient proteomic landscapes that were highly correlated with AD pathology and cognitive decline.
This mouse-to-human conservation of G9a-translated AD proteomes suggests that the therapeutic effects of
MS1262 in mice could extend to AD patients. Thus, we will test the hypothesis that targeting G9a-mediated
translational mechanisms using brain-penetrant drugs is a specific and effective strategy to prevent and/or
reverse AD progression. In Phase I, we will test the hypothesis that targeting G9a-mediated translational
mechanisms using MS1262 is a specific and effective strategy to prevent and/or reverse AD progression.
Specifically, in the
MS1262
-treated AD mouse models including 5xFAD mice and other established AD mouse
models at different stages of AD progression we will (1) comprehensively determine the long-term efficacy and
the specificity of MS1262 on synaptic and cognitive function,
(2)
measure inhibitor toxicity and brain specificity
by dose range finding and pharmacokinetic studies, and (3) validate the clinical accuracy of G9a inhibitory
mechanism. In
Phase II
we will use the Phase I-optimized doses with low toxicity to test the treatment efficacy
for AD patients. Meanwhile, we will develop companion diagnostic assays to stratify patients for enhanced
therapy with high response rates. The end deliverable of phase II funding will be an FDA IND application."
10820280,"1 Medical devices contain chemicals that can leach and cause adverse effects. International standards (ISO
 2 10993) require the evaluation of such chemicals for specific toxicity endpoints, including skin sensitization,
 3 irritation, and cytotoxicity. Short-terms assays commonly used for this task are time-consuming, expensive, and
 4 require the sacrifice of many animals. Emerging FDA directives call to restrict and, eventually, eliminate animal
 5 testing of medical and cosmetic products and develop alternative methods including computational tools. To
 6 address this unmet need, in Phase I of this project we have created the largest carefully curated and publicly
 7 available Guinea Pig Maximization Test (GPMT) dataset and developed first-in-class machine learning models
 8 that predict the GPMT outcome. We implemented our models within the fully operational Predictor of Skin
 9 Sensitization for Medical Devices (PreSS/MD) web portal. In Phase II, we will create new models and software
10 modules for reliable assessment of chemicals found in medical devices for sensitization, irritation, and
11 cytotoxicity per ISO 10993 guidance. These modules will be both available for licensing as standalone tools or
12 web applications as well as integrated into novel Predictor of Toxicity for Medical Devices (PredTox/MD) web
13 portal. The proposed R&D studies are structured around the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: Develop
14 a highly curated, comprehensive PredTox/MD database. We will collect, thoroughly curate, and integrate
15 public data for all human, in vivo, and in vitro regulatory assays for skin sensitization, irritation/corrosion, and
16 cytotoxicity. We will extend our database to include all available data on chemical mixtures and develop special
17 curation workflows to handle mixtures of any composition. Specific Aim 2: Develop validated computational
18 models to predict sensitization, irritation, and cytotoxicity for chemicals leaching from medical devices.
19 We will employ our widely accepted predictive Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling
20 workflow fully compliant with OECD model validation principles. Consensus ensemble models will be developed
21 with several descriptor types and machine learning algorithms, including deep and active learning and a
22 Bayesian model integrating multiple individual assay models to predict the overall chemical safety. Specific Aim
23 3: Develop software modules for assessing medical device toxicity and incorporate these modules into
24 PredTox/MD portal. Models and workflows developed in Aim 2 will be programmed as autonomous software
25 modules that will be integrated into PredTox/MD platform and available for individual licensing to enable rapid
26 multi-point toxicity assessment for extractables and leachables found in medical devices. Successful
27 completion of Phase II studies will result in the novel computational toolkit and web-based resource to

10828190,"Partial reprogramming in vivo is an exciting emerging field based on observation that short-term expression of
Yamanaka factors (Oct4, Sox3, Klf4, cMyc, abbreviated as OSKM) in vivo rejuvenate diverse functional
aspects of several tissues. However, prolonged expression of OSKM factors in vivo leads to teratomas, which
emphasizes the need for tightly controlled delivery and accurate detection of the epigenetic changes as a
means to monitor reprogramming. Given the astounding therapeutic potential of this approach and an
exponentially growing interest both from academia and in the industry, the need for accurate quantitation of
epigenetic changes in vivo, including at the single-cell level, is pressing. We propose a single cell method that
is robust, scalable, and cost-effective assay to quantitate epigenetic changes following partial reprogramming -
microscopic imaging of Epigenetic Age (miEpiAge). The Terskikh laboratory has developed a novel technique
rooted in the analysis of epigenome topography at the single-cell level to quantitate change in chromatin
landscape. We capture patterns of nuclear staining of epigenetic marks (e.g. acetylated and methylated
histones) and employ automated microscopy and machine learning to determine multiparametric signature of
cellular state. Application of this technique to aging, miEpiAge, demonstrated robust separation of young and
old mouse and human cells. miEpiAge signatures of PBMC/CD3+ cells correlate (R2=0.86) with chronological
age without linear regression. Doxorubicin (DOX) and Caloric Restriction (CR) interventions indicate that
miEpiAge successfully detects the acceleration of aging after chemotherapy treatment and the slowdown of
aging after CR diet in chronologically matched animals. Critically, miEpiAge successfully detects the
rejuvenating effect of partial reprogramming in whole livers, revealing, for the first time, single-cell
heterogeneity. We will expand these studies to validate miEpiAge technique in different tissues and directly
compare it with whole genome analysis of chromatin state. To obtain orthogonal validation, we will interrogate
the same samples using ATAC-seq and Cut&Tag to map and correlate miEpiAge multiparametric signatures
with overall chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) and genome-wide distribution of specific epigenetic marks
(Cut&Tag). Phase I will provide proof of concept and will yield a established correlation of miEpiAge to the
orthogonal whole genome chromatin states thereby establishing miEpiAge as a high information content
analysis tool. These experiments will demonstrate the broad utility of miEpiAge as a robust and cost-effective
platform for evaluating multi-tissue rejuvenation in vivo."
10786240,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Blood transfusion is the most commonly performed hospital procedure, with over 11 million red blood cell (RBC)
units transfused each year in the United States alone. To accommodate time lags between blood donation and
transfusion, blood units are preserved and refrigerated until use. Current FDA guidelines limit the shelf life of
Adsol-preserved stored RBCs to 42 days. Beyond this window, efficacy of the transfusion product is thought to
be compromised. This is because storage alters the RBC membrane permeability and eventually leads to RBC
stiffening and loss of flexibility, irreversible sphericity, and a diminished ability to pass through the
microcirculation once transfused. Despite standard FDA guidelines, these adverse changes are known to
progress at varying rates and are thought to have a differential impact on transfusion outcomes in vulnerable
populations. Whether RBCs should be transfused after a 35-day limit is a topic of debate; however, substantial
evidence suggests that a tailored approach, accounting for the wide variation in RBC deterioration rates, should
be implemented rather than a universal expiration date. Blood has been described as a viscoelastic fluid, with
quantifiable elasticity, viscosity, and relaxation time that alter with storage age and with the proportion of stiffened
RBCs. However, the deterioration rates (e.g., stiffening) of RBCs vary widely by the blood donor, and storage
age alone is not a reliable indicator of RBC quality. Our group has been developing acoustic radiation force
impulse (ARFI) ultrasound, a promising approach for monitoring blood characteristics through sono-transparent
surroundings, such as polyvinylchloride blood bags. The advantage of a contact-free assay is two-fold: 1).
Human blood is a biohazard and exposure risks should be minimized, and 2). Sampling blood units by standard
techniques breaks the sterility of the blood bag, rendering the blood product unusable. A point-of-care, contact-
free assay to evaluate stored RBC quality prior to transfusion has the potential to transform clinical practice by
implementing a precision medicine approach to transfusion efficacy. Although shear wave elastography imaging
(SWEI) is a commercially available ultrasound technique for assessing viscoelasticity of solid tissues, it is not
amenable to anticoagulated blood because shear waves rapidly attenuate in fluid media. Unlike SWEI; however,
ARFI does not depend upon shear wave propagation, making it more suitable for the evaluation of fluids. In this
3-year project, we will accomplish the following: 1). Optimize the ARFI beam sequences to assess stored blood
viscoelascity, using ektacytometry (i.e., elongation index, a measure of bulk RBC deformability) and viscometry
as comparative references for ARFI metrics, 2). Validate the clinical relevance of ARFI viscoelasticity by
analyzing pre-transfusion ARFI metrics and post-transfusion hemoglobin increment, in an observational study
enrolling 50 study participants undergoing clinically indicated RBC transfusion, and 3). Compare ARFI metrics
versus storage age as predictors of transfusion outcomes."

Opioid analgesics are commonly used to treat pain but have serious side effects, including addiction,
dependence, and death from overdose. While there is a significant need for new non-addictive analgesics,
efforts to develop new pain medicines have met with limited success. In part, this failure is due to an
overreliance on evoked pain measures in preclinical models. Indeed, most preclinical models do not measure
spontaneous pain—the main symptom of chronic pain in humans. To increase translational relevance, the
Mouse Grimace Scale (MGS) was developed to quantify characteristic facial expressions associated with
spontaneous pain. The MGS is reproducible across labs and was used to evaluate the efficacy of analgesics.
However, the MGS has not been widely adopted due to its high resource demands and low throughput. To
overcome this limitation, we adapted a machine learning model to classify the presence or absence of pain
from mouse facial expressions. We called this model the automated Mouse Grimace Scale (aMGS). After
training, this model identified mice in pain with 94% accuracy, comparable to a highly-trained human. However,
our original “aMGS 1.0” is limited in several respects. It is only accurate at detecting facial grimacing in white-
coated mice, and produces a binary assessment (“pain” vs. “no pain”) instead of a graded score. Moreover,
aMGS 1.0 cannot dynamically determine pain status from full-motion videos. Additionally, we relied on an older
piece of software that does not consistently extract high-quality images of the mouse face. The aMGS 1.0 also
has difficulty distinguishing between images of sleeping and grimacing mice. Finally, aMGS 1.0 suffers from a
“black box” problem inherent to most machine learning algorithms, in that we do not know what facial details it
uses to produce a pain assessment. Here we propose to overcome all of these limitations by developing
a more sophisticated version of our automated pain classifier (aMGS 2.0). To achieve this goal we will: 1)
Develop and validate a new open-source platform to classify (frame-by-frame) spontaneous pain intensity from
mouse facial expressions, using albino (white) mice and motion information. 2) Enhance the generality of
aMGS 2.0 for use with black mice. And, 3) Develop a user-friendly web-based platform that operates on
computer-based and mobile devices. We will validate the utility of aMGS with three pain assays that produce
grimaces in rodents—inflammatory pain, post-surgical (laparotomy) pain, and neuropathic pain. To increase
rigor and reproducibility, two pain assays will be performed and scored with aMGS 2.0 in an independent lab.
Numerous investigators in the pain field have expressed interest in using our proposed model. The platform
will include a cloud-based data repository and analytic tools to facilitate curation of public data, continuous
improvement of the model over time, and integration of new analytic tools. One analytic tool that we plan to
develop will identify mouse features that most influence pain classification."

Immune system development during infancy and childhood sets the stage for a lifetime of protective immunity.
Infants and children are known to be more susceptible to ubiquitous respiratory and mucosal pathogens for
which adults have prior exposures. However, our recent experience in the COVID-19 pandemic, in which
children were markedly less susceptible than adults to disease from infection with the novel respiratory virus
SARS-CoV-2, indicate that children's immune systems can be highly effective to newly encountered
pathogens. The diverse repertoire of naïve T cells, their ability to differentiate to tissue homing effector cells,
which mediate pathogen clearance at infection sites, and the subsequent generation of long-lived memory T
cells are critical events in immune responses that are not defined in children. Identifying the mechanisms by
which T cells respond to antigenic challenges and establish immunological memory throughout infancy and
childhood are essential for improving vaccines and immunotherapies to protect the next generation. My
laboratory has been studying early life immunity in mouse models and novel human samples, including tissues
from infant and pediatric organ donors, with a focus on how protective tissue resident memory T cells (TRM)
become established in early life and mature over childhood. We pioneered the study of human tissue immunity
in organ donor tissues, identifying that the majority of T cells across tissues in the body are TRM, which begin
to form in early life in intestines and mature over age. We have identified fundamental and intrinsic differences
in infant compared to adult T cells at the earliest stages in T cell activation and have investigated anti-viral
immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in different pediatric cohorts. Our central hypothesis is that pediatric T cell responses
are distinct due to intrinsic signaling mechanisms, the specific tissue environment, and the antigenic exposure
history. In this study, we will build on our results, human samples, and cohorts to elucidate mechanisms for the
distinct responses of pediatric T cells and their differentiation fate, maturation in tissues, and evolving response
to vaccines. In aim 1, we will identify mechanisms for the distinct activation of pediatric naïve T cells, including
how early events during T cell conjugate formation and cell division impact cell fate in early life and childhood
for mouse and human T cells. In aim 2, we will elucidate TRM differentiation pathways and the role of the
tissue in TRM maturation by high dimensional single cell profiling of human TRM in intestines and lungs across
all ages of childhood, and use mouse models to address the role of persistence and tissue environment in
TRM maturation. In aim 3, we will analyze vaccine-specific immune responses and evolution over childhood in
established cohorts of children who previously had different clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection, or
were not infected. We will assess virus-specific T cell and antibody responses to the current COVID mRNA
vaccines over time and age. Together, the proposed studies will comprehensively define immune system
maturation over this critical and formative window of childhood."

Social behaviors are essential for survival and reproduction. They also evolve quite rapidly and can
vary even among closely related species. Traditionally, social behaviors are very difficult to study
because of the complexity of their input, requiring conspecifics to trigger aggressive, cooperative,
parental, or reproductive behaviors. Additionally, contextual data is important, such as hierarchical
status and environmental factors can also play a role. T his grant will propose to create a
behavioral arena capable of mimicking natural environments that are required for social reproductive
behaviors, including interactions between a large number of conspecifics, environmental factors
such as male displays, and contextual data such as hierarchical status between various males. Tools
will be created to track animals in this arena and build a computational frame work to measure
and compare social behavioral dynamics. This work will utilize Lake Malawi cichlids, a powerful
evolutionary model for identification of genes and neural circuit changes associated with differences
in behavior. This project will generate new tools and datasets for modeling social behaviors, paving the
way for a large-scale R01."

Allergic asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease that often progresses from childhood to adulthood.
Approximately 8% of the world population suffer from allergic asthma, making it one of the most common
respiratory diseases. Allergic asthma is characterized by recurrent type 2 inflammation, mucus
hyperplasia, and airway hyperreactivity. Current treatment strategies aim to temporally alleviate the
symptoms of asthma attack and have no beneficial effect on disease progression. Recent studies have
identified pathogenic T helper 2 resident memory cells in the lung (Th2-TRMs) as the critical driver of
recurrent exacerbations in allergic asthma and thus, an appealing therapeutic target. Considering that
allergic asthma has an early age onset, pathogenic Th2-TRMs likely are established since early
childhood. However, pathogenic Th2-TRMs in the immature lung have not been characterized, at least
in part, due to technical difficulties of accessing the lung tissue in young children with allergic asthma. In
addition, a majority of allergic asthma models are generated using adult animals. As such, how
pathogenic Th2-TRMs are established following early life allergen exposure is unknown. Here, employing
two neonatal mouse models of allergic inflammation that reproduce the saline features of progressive
allergic asthma in patients, we provide evidence that age is a critical factor in the lung Th2-TRM program.
In Preliminary Studies, we show that Th2 effector cells induced by neonatal allergen exposure are more
readily to become resident memory cells than the counterparts induced in adults. We also find that
environmental signals unique to the immature lung, such as nerve-derived dopamine, promote residency
of Th2 TRMs. In addition to our preliminary results, the type 2 bias of immature CD4+ T cells and dendritic
cells is well-characterized and may also contribute to the phenotype and the function of allergen-specific
Th2-TRMs established in early life. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that immaturity of CD4+ T
cells and the lung environment in early life endows an age-related Th2-TRM program to promote
residency and anamnestic allergic inflammation. To test this hypothesis, we will compare Th2-TRMs
generated following allergen exposure in neonatal and adult mice to identify differences in the phenotype
and the function of allergen-specific Th2 TRMs with age. To what extent the immaturity of T cells and the
developing lung environment contribute to age-related Th2-TRM phenotypes will also be assessed. The
results of our proposed studies will identify molecular mediators unique to the early life Th2-TRM
program. These mediators can be studied in future R01 projects as therapeutic targets to modify the
progression of allergic asthma from childhood to adulthood."

Racial disparities in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) have been well documented. At the
same time, there is increasing scientific evidence that early life condition and particularly early-life education
are key modifiable risk factors for ADRD. However, there is a critical lack of data and knowledge about how
early-life education may protect against later-life ADRD risk separately for Black and white adults. To fill this
gap, we propose to leverage and expand an existing, well documented occupational cohort of autoworkers at
General Motors (GM) between 1938-1994. We will use historic census linkages to capture the cohort’s early
life educational environment and linkages with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) data to
capture their chronic conditions and ADRD diagnoses. Importantly, this cohort includes a relatively large
number of Black workers, most of whom lived in various parts of the South as children but migrated north to
Michigan by midlife, and all worked at unionized auto plants with good medical benefits. Our central hypothesis
is that, despite having similar jobs and access to healthcare in midlife, access to quality education in early life
will be related to ADRD risk within racial categories, with a stronger relationship for Black autoworkers.
To examine the association between early life education and ADRD, we will first characterize the cohort’s
overall and ADRD disease profile by race by linking the autoworkers cohort with CMS chronic disease files. We
will then describe census-level household characteristics (parental education and parental occupation) and
childhood circumstances (racial segregation, child mortality, area wealth, education availability/quality) within
Black and white GM autoworkers by linking the UAW-GM cohort with historical census data. Finally, we
propose to estimate the association between availability and quality of educational opportunities in childhood
and later-life ADRD risk separately for Black and white UAW-GM workers born 1920-1940. By leveraging a
cohort of older adults defined by their similar mid-life work experiences, but with vastly different early life
educational opportunities, we can isolate those parts of the education-ADRD relationship that are not mediated
by employment quality or healthcare access in adulthood.
The research team includes epidemiologists, a health policy economist, and data analysts with extensive
experience working with this cohort, administrative data, and historical census linkage projects. The study team
has substantial statistical modeling experience but are relatively new to ADRD research and eager to collect
preliminary data to support future work in this substantive area."

Transgender and gender diverse people exhibit a significantly lower quality of life than the general public. One
reason for this is voice dysphoria: distress because a person’s voice does not match their gender identity (e.g.,
trans women with deep voices). Reducing this voice-gender incongruence can improve quality of life, but is
difficult to achieve. It can be done with surgery, but the process is expensive and invasive. Alternatively, gender-
affirming voice and communication training (GAVT) guided by a speech-language pathologist (SLP) can be
effective, but is time-consuming, costly, and has additional barriers such as lack of qualified GAVT providers.
One way to provide more accessible GAVT would be through smartphone- or computer-based software that
delivers information about voice, suggests exercises, and provides feedback on exercise performance. However,
while some smartphone apps have been developed for GAVT, they are limited in scope and not accepted by
transgender people. A critical reason for this is lack of visual-acoustic biofeedback: visual information about how
the user’s voice “sounds” and how this should be modified during exercises.
This project will first develop novel GAVT software that combines visual-acoustic biofeedback about pitch and
resonance (two main indicators of voice femininity/masculinity) with exercises for these targets. The software
will be based on preliminary work by our team, which already created real-time pitch and resonance visualization
software. Multiple exercises and feedback visualizations will be developed modularly and iteratively evaluated
in lab sessions. Pitch and resonance modification performance as well as System Usability Scale and Intrinsic
Motivation scores will be collected to verify usability, motivation, and ability to induce short-term voice alterations.
The software will then be evaluated in a practical setting: as a supplement to SLP-led GAVT sessions over a 3-
week period. Forty trans women will be randomly assigned to either an experimental group (which will use our
prototype software) or a control group (which will use a generic voice analysis app). They will meet an SLP once
a week virtually for remotely administered GAVT, and the SLP will prescribe homework (type and difficulty of
exercises) to be performed between sessions. Self-reported amount of daily practice (primary outcome) as well
as self-reported self-efficacy and intrinsic motivation scores will be compared between groups.
Upon completion, the project will result in the first GAVT software that combines visual-acoustic biofeedback of
pitch and resonance with structured exercises – highly requested but currently unavailable features of such
software. The software will be released for free and thus immediately provide transgender people and SLPs with
free interactive tools for GAVT; furthermore, it can later be expanded with other important features. In the long
term, GAVT software may become an essential tool to reduce gender dysphoria in transgender and gender
diverse individuals, thus improving quality of life for this marginalized population. Furthermore, advancements in
this area may generalize to computer-aided therapy for communication disorders, increasing potential impact."
10789443,"The mature form of human mesothelin (MSLN) is a cell-surface protein that is normally expressed at a low
level on the mesothelial cells but is overexpressed in many cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma and
mesothelioma, making it a practical target for therapeutic antibody applications. Our long-term goal, to
develop MSLN-targeting domain antibodies that will be utilized to design therapeutic reagents. MSLN is
highly relevant to environmentally caused disease and human health. In this research, we propose to
develop a screening system for biparatopic human heavy chain (VH) domains in the tandem VH1-VH1- form,
to find a better MSLN binder and to test whether biparatopic screening will identify novel binders compared
to tethered VH domains generated using individually screened VHs. In Aim 1, we will identify binding sites of
the tethered VH1-VH2- that were generated using the individually screened VHs. In Aim 2, we will develop a
direct screening system of the biparatopic antibody domain in the VH1-VH2- form. Results obtained in each
Aim will be independently fruitful to develop MSLN antibodies. We will also compare VH1-VH2 sequences
and MSLN-binding sites obtained in Aim 2 with those in Aim 1. By identifying how the sequences and
binding site are changed by the screening in Aim 2, we will scale up anti-MSLN VH1-VH2 screening and their
characterization, including optimization of biparatopic CAR-T cell design, immunoncology and animal
studies, and [in the future] plan to generalize the biparatopic domain antibody screening approach to other
important tumor-associated antigens."

Homicide is a leading cause of death among women who are pregnant and within 1 year
postpartum in the US. A majority of cases involve intimate partner violence (IPV), which is
known to escalate during pregnancy. Our overall objective is to understand, from the
perspective of health care providers and survivors of violence, barriers and preferences for
increasing IPV screening and supports in maternity care settings. This information will inform
the future development and implementation of a multi-level intervention to build capacity and
improve provider and system-level responses in the care of pregnant and postpartum women
experiencing IPV. Our specific aims are (1) To identify specific barriers to and preferences for
IPV screening and responding as perceived by health care providers, and (2) To obtain in-depth
understanding of the preferences around screening and responses to IPV as perceived
survivors of violence during pregnancy and postpartum. Our approach involves the convening of
focus groups comprised of health care providers who may come in contact with pregnant and
postpartum people (including OB/GYNs, advanced practice registered nurses, pediatricians,
midwives, doulas, lactation consultants, and emergency department practitioners) as well as
persons who experienced violence during pregnancy or the postpartum period. We will use
Nominal Group Technique, a structured idea-generating process that produces quantitative
weights to a breadth of issues that were obtained through a qualitative, discussion-based
approach. Findings from this work will include a comprehensive view of reasons underlying the
consistently low rates of identification and responding to IPV among pregnant and partum
people among a diverse group of providers who are mostly likely to encounter this population.
Of critical importance, this work will center the voice of those with lived experience and provide
a detailed characterization of how best to identify and support pregnant IPV survivors in health
care settings, by their own account."

The aims of this project are to provide healthy, behaviorally normal, MHC-characterized, SPF pig-tailed
macaques for NIH-funded HIV/AIDS related research. We will expand the size of the current SPF breeding
colony to increase the numbers of females for breeding and juvenile males and females available for sale to
NIH-funded HIV/AIDS investigators both within Johns Hopkins University and at other research institutions.
Complete pedigrees and health data are maintained and provided to investigators when animals are being
selected for sale. Viral screening includes regular serologic and PCR testing for 4 viral agents: Cercopithecine
herpesvirus 1 (B virus), Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV), Simian Retrovirus (SRV), and Simian T-
lymphotrophic Virus (STLV). For the past decade the colony has consistently and repeatedly tested negative
for these agents. Major histocompatibility (MHC) profiles are performed on all juveniles during the first year of
life and are provided to investigators when animals are being selected for purchase. Over the last five years,
the colony has produced an average of 51 offspring each year, resulting in an average of 32 animals sold. We
estimate that selling 42 animals per year would allow the colony to achieve self-sufficiency, a goal we project
we will reach by the end of 2028."

Headache has been one of the top three causes of disability adjusted life years for the past three decades
among adolescents and young adults. The inspiration for this research comes from the disproportionately
higher burden that falls on girls and women starting in puberty, when prevalence rises more quickly in girls
than boys, then continues to be higher in women throughout the middle years of life. Puberty also appears to
be a sensitive period in brain development when sex differences in regions key to headache such as the
amygdala are driven by pubertal hormones. Despite these sex differences, the role of pubertal hormones such
as estrogen and testosterone are not yet well-enough understood to be targets for prevention. This proposal is
focused on the innovative study of gender affirming hormone therapy with testosterone in transmasculine
adolescents as a model of puberty in which the timing of estrogen and testosterone changes are controlled.
The aims of this proposal are to 1) determine association between gender affirming hormone therapy with
testosterone in adolescence and headache in a cross-sectional study from in a multi-center health record
database, 2) determine change in headache burden in response to gender affirming hormone therapy with
testosterone and 3) determine changes in brain structure and function in response to gender affirming
hormone therapy with testosterone. The scientific objective of this proposal is to start to outline the key points
in development at which pubertal hormones can alter risk for headache and the physiologic underpinning for
this alteration. These targets can then be applied in future clinical studies of hormonal management of
headache in adolescence.
This is a five-year career development research proposal. I am currently an Assistant Professor at the
University of Colorado School of Medicine’s Department of Pediatrics in the Division of Child Neurology at
Children’s Hospital Colorado. The outlined proposal builds on my previous research and clinical experience in
neuroimaging of pubertal brain development and pediatric headache by expanding to a model of transgender
adolescent headache. The proposed research and training plan will prepare me with a unique skillset for
translational research as an independent clinician scientist in the emerging field of the effect of sex steroids on
neurologic conditions in transgender youth and in headache sex differences research."

 Dr. Greenhouse is a physician scientist trained in internal medicine, infectious diseases, and
biostatistics. Over the past 18 years, he has worked across domains of field epidemiology, laboratory science,
data science, and public health to investigate the epidemiology of infectious diseases, with a focus on disease
transmission and development of immunity. His growth as a scientist and mentor was substantially accelerated
due to the dedicated time afforded by his current K24. Studies to accomplish the research aims outlined in his
prior K24 application have all been published as peer-reviewed papers and/or are the subject of active, R01-
level NIH grants where he or a clinician scientist that he mentors serves as principal investigator. During this
project period he published 80 papers, was PI on 3 new grants including R01 and U01 awards from NIAID,
was co-investigator on 6 new grants, and was primary mentor for 2 new K awards. Regarding mentorship, he
supervised 39 trainees including 14 from low- or middle-income countries, cofounded the UCSF EPPIcenter as
a center of excellence for research and training in patient-oriented research, created two longitudinal training
programs in malaria genetic epidemiology for African scientists, and co-led 3 workshops in genomic
epidemiologic analysis for over 100 African scientists.
 During the next K24 project period, Dr. Greenhouse proposes to 1) focus on leadership development so
he can better guide the growth and success of the EPPIcenter; 2) expand the scope of his research portfolio to
include pathogens beyond malaria and the addition of domestic research; and 3) establish an interactive,
online training platform in genomic epidemiologic analysis. He presents a plan for achieving these goals by
obtaining leadership development training, expanding his skill set in the epidemiology of respiratory viruses
and laboratory methods for multi-pathogen surveillance, and developing expertise in curricular development
and other principles such as the use of technology for effective teaching. Dr. Greenhouse’s existing research
portfolio provides a wealth of opportunities for trainees, including projects studying the longitudinal
development of naturally acquired immunity to malaria using birth cohorts to simultaneously study the
pathogen and the host; systems immunology and computational analysis to comprehensively characterize
factors associated with development of immunity to malaria; and an array of projects related to the genomic
epidemiology of malaria including multiple with explicit training and capacity building goals. He proposes to
expand the scope of his research portfolio with 3 specific aims: 1) to develop and apply amplicon sequencing
tools to solve current challenges in malaria surveillance; 2) to characterize the pathogen landscape of non-
malarial febrile illness in Uganda; and 3) to characterize the transmission of respiratory pathogens in an urban
immigrant community in San Francisco."

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and metapneumovirus (MPV) are the two leading viral causes of death in
infants and young children, and are major causes of respiratory illness in immunocompromised adults and the
elderly. Unfortunately, there is currently no vaccine or effective therapy available for either infection. Synagis, a
monthly intramuscular injection of the monoclonal antibody (mAb) palivizumab, is the only FDA-approved
intervention given to a very small subset of high-risk infants as immunoprophylaxis. However, it is not effective
at treating RSV infections. There are no MPV treatments currently in any stage of clinical development. Thus,
for the tens of thousands of patients hospitalized for either RSV or MPV, only supportive therapy is available,
and morbidity and mortality are substantial. Interestingly, both viruses spread in the lung by shedding daughter
viruses exclusively into the airway lumen; shed viruses must then traverse airway mucus (AM) before
infecting neighboring cells, and infections remain primarily restricted to the airways with little to no systemic
viremia. We believe a virus-specific, safe, effective and topically-delivered antiviral would provide a powerful
option to address the current gap in pharmacological interventions. Mucommune is developing MM004 to meet
the urgent need for a bronchiolitis treatment, based on our “muco-trapping” mAb platform. MM-004 is a topical
mAb treatment based on (i) bispecific mAb possessing “muco-trapping” Fc and binding domains that
neutralizes both RSV and MPV, and (ii) direct delivery to the lung airways using a vibrating mesh nebulizer. By
concentrating MM004 at the site of infection rather than delivering it systemically, we expect to enable
efficacious and cost-effective treatment for both RSV and MPV, with little risk of adverse side effects, due to
limited systemic adsorption after pulmonary delivery. In RSV-infected neonatal lambs, a highly relevant model
for pediatric RSV, our muco-trapping mAb against RSV greatly reduced infectious RSV viral load in infected
neonatal lambs in lung tissues to non-detectible levels, and reduced bronchiolitis, neutrophil infiltration and
inflammation to levels that were often indistinguishable compared to uninfected animals. Building off this
promising result, we have now engineered a bispecific mAb (MM-004) that potently traps both RSV and MPV
in human AM and facilitates rapid clearance from the mouse lung. In this proposal, we seek to validate in
Phase 1 whether MM004 can effectively treat MPV infections in hamsters, the best available model for MPV. If
successful, we will advance to Phase 2, where we will develop a Master Cell Bank cell line for high yield
production of MM-004 (Aim 1), and conduct a number of IND-enabling studies including, GLP tox studies in
rats, tissue cross reactivity studies, and pre-IND filing (Aim 2). Both Phase 2 Aims are part of the critical path
to quickly advance MM-004 into clinical development, and will put us in a position to file IND within 12 months
from completing this project. Our work will also help pave the way for improved, molecularly-targeted
aerosolized therapies against various respiratory infections."

Summary: This proposal supports a five-year training program for Dr. Sabo to gain the skills she needs to
become an independent physician-scientist and an expert in reproductive immunology. Dr. Sabo has a
background in basic science and immunology, and plans to shift her focus to clinically-oriented, translational
research. She has developed a set of aims that align with her research interests, and six core learning objectives
to help her make this transition. Research plan: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) and sub-optimal vaginal bacterial taxa
have been associated with HIV acquisition. The precise mechanism by which this occurs is unknown, but may
be related to increased cervical inflammation. Dendritic cells (DCs) are critical for regulating the inflammatory
state of mucosal tissues, and likely play a role in genital acquisition of HIV. However, DCs remain minimally
characterized in the cervix. The purpose of this proposal is to examine if sub-optimal vaginal bacteria and
increased vaginal bacterial species diversity are associated with increased total cervical DCs. We have
proposed three aims to answer this question. For AIMS 1 and 2, we will perform a cross sectional study of
female sex workers (FSWs) enrolled in a longitudinal, open cohort study in Mombasa, Kenya. Vaginal swabs
and cervical biopsy samples will be collected at a single visit. To determine if high-risk bacterial taxa are
associated with increased DC number (AIM 1), we will evaluate the association between concentrations of
vaginal bacteria (measured by quantitative PCR [qPCR]) and total numbers of cervical DCs (measured by flow
cytometry from tissue digests of cervical biopsies). To examine the relationship between vaginal bacterial
species diversity and cervical DCs (AIM 2), we will perform broad range PCR with high throughput sequencing
of vaginal swabs to calculate the Shannon Diversity Index (SDI) for each patient, and the SDI will be compared
to the number of DCs isolated by flow cytometry. In AIM 3, we will test the hypothesis that treatment of BV
reduces the number of cervical DCs. As an exploratory outcome, DC activation will be assessed by measurement
of cell surface co-stimulatory markers and intracellular pro-inflammatory cytokines for all aims. Together, these
aims have the potential to provide evidence for a mechanistic link between sub-optimal vaginal microbiota,
cervical inflammation, and HIV susceptibility in women. Training plan: The six core learning objectives for this
K23 award period include training in epidemiology, clinical studies, global health, high dimensional data analysis,
mucosal immunology, and the vaginal microbiome. These goals were selected to ensure that Dr. Sabo acquires
the skills necessary to lead her own clinical studies and launch an independent research career performing
translational studies to elucidate the role of the reproductive immune system in health and disease. Training to
complete the six key learning objectives will be achieved through a combination of mentorship, coursework,
implementation of the proposed research plan, local seminars, and national and international meetings.

10808228,"Spatial perception is based on various sensory inputs processed within a widely-distributed cerebral network. Cur-
rently it is not known how these multisensory mechanisms and their contributions to spatial orientation are affected
by aging. Clinical histories in elderly frequently entail experiences of spatial misperceptions with sudden feelings of
imbalance or tilt that can lead to injuries that are highly morbid and costly. Here we combine psychophysics and
mathematical modelling to investigate age-related changes in these ‘high order’ mechanisms. We have studied
spatial orientation in the context of Bayesian spatial model (BSM), which incorporates the sensory signals that
encode the head and eye positions to quantify perceived upright orientation. Accordingly, the signal-to-noise ratio
in each sensory modality affects its reliability for integration into an internal (i.e., neural) estimate that contributes
to spatial orientation. In this novel approach, sensory contributions are measured directly in psychophysical para-
digms. In this proposal, we apply the same approach within the quantitative BSM framework to study changes in
spatial orientation with aging. We’ve found individuals with vestibular loss have a bias in spatial orientation related
to underestimation of their head position. With aging, there is also sensory loss in the vestibular system that can
lead to problems with balance and spatial orientation by affecting how the brain reweights sensory information to
compensate for such changes. This reweighting process is important to understand for devising diagnostic tools
and rehabilitation/treatment programs preferably at the individual subject level. On this basis, our central hypothesis
is that in the process of sensory integration for spatial orientation, older individuals underestimate their eye and
head positions, resulting in larger errors of spatial orientation and more postural instability compared with younger
individuals. To test this hypothesis, we (i) parse out sensory contributions to spatial orientation in aging, and (ii)
examine whether they correspond with age-related vestibular physiologic changes and fall risk. A key vestibular
input is from the otoliths that contributes to wide range of neurophysiologic functions such as sensing the head
motion with respect to gravity and it also drives the vestibulo-ocular response known as the ocular counter roll
(OCR). We have developed a video-oculography measure of OCR (vOCR), which is done with a simple tilt maneu-
ver. Here we also examine whether vOCR can be used as a biomarker of age-related changes in spatial orientation,
postural stability, and fall risk. Overall, this approach gives us a unique opportunity to apply our current research
work towards elucidating sensory contributions to changes in spatial orientation with aging. The key developments
in this proposal are identifying distinct changes in spatial orientation and examining a clinical measure of otolith
function as potential biomarker to assess and track age-related perceptual and balance functions."

prevention. Let's Talk is a novel intervention to promote and support cascade screening in families with Lynch
syndrome. Developed using intervention mapping, a 6-step, stakeholder-engaged methodology for developing
theory-based interventions, the workbook intervention addresses barriers to cascade screening through
information chunking, guided practice, planning coping responses, and gain frame messaging for patients, their
provider and family. Preliminary data have demonstrated that the content of Let's Talk, in a paper-based
format, is acceptable to patients with Lynch syndrome, and all patients reported that they would recommend its
use to someone recently diagnosed with Lynch syndrome. In addition, all patients in our usability study
endorsed the development of an interactive, online version, which could improve dissemination, given changes
in genetic counseling workflows due to COVID-19, and could facilitate ongoing patient support through follow-
up messaging. Thus, the overall objective of this project is to (1) adapt and refine an interactive online format
for Let's Talk based on patient preferences and user feedback, and (2) pilot test Let's Talk to assess its
feasibility by measuring implementation (primary) and effectiveness outcomes. The expected outcomes of this
project will move the field forward in tackling challenges associated with cascade screening in Lynch syndrome
and other hereditary conditions. This work will provide foundational data for a future R01 application to test the
effectiveness and implementation of Let's Talk for increasing cascade screening uptake and identification of
relatives with Lynch syndrome across diverse care settings."

 This proposal requests support for investigating the structure and enzymology of glucose-6-phosphatase
catalytic subunit 1 (G6PC1), an integral membrane protein of the phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2 (PAP2)
superfamily expressed in the ER that catalyzes glucose production in the liver. Unregulated G6PC1 activity
contributes to diabetes pathology by driving increases in hepatic glucose production and fasting blood glucose.
In contrast, mutations in G6PC1 that impair activity cause glycogen storage disease type 1a (GSD type 1a),
which is characterized primarily by severe hypoglycemia. Despite its physiological relevance to glucose
metabolism, the structural basis of catalysis as well as the impairment caused by disease-linked mutations is
poorly understood. This application outlines an experimental plan encompassed within three specific aims that
integrates complementary biophysical and computational techniques to study the mechanistic structural biology
of mouse G6PC1 (mG6PC1), a stable G6PC1 ortholog, in unprecedented detail. The research plan is facilitated
by published methodological advancements developed in the PI’s laboratory that support purification of
functional mG6PC1 from Sf9 cell membranes. The scientific approach capitalizes on preliminary 3D models
predicted within the AlphaFold2 (AF2) computational framework as templates for experimental design. The
cornerstone of this proposal is the application of double electron electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy
between nitroxide spin labels introduced into the mG6PC1 sequence to establish the veracity of computational
models, obtain restraints for structural refinement and to describe the conformational dynamics of the catalytic
cycle. The relative stability of these intermediates will be assessed in the background of mutants known to cause
GSD type 1a. Informed by the spectroscopic analysis, cryogenic electron microscopy single particle analysis will
be used to build high resolution models of stable catalytic intermediates. The experimental approach is grounded
in the expertise of the PI and the team of established collaborators in the molecular biology of G6PC1 and the
biophysical analysis of membrane proteins employing the described toolkit. A working mechanistic model has
been derived from pilot spectroscopic studies indicating that mG6PC1 operates by a substrate-dependent
conformational equilibrium between “resting” and “active” states mediated by relative rearrangement of a unique
ancillary motif of transmembrane helices attached to the conserved PAP2 domain. Molecular dynamics
simulations in conjunction with a robust in vitro platform for screening expression and activity have uncovered
multiple modes of catalytic inhibition induced by GSD type 1a variants found in the active site. The research
strategy will extend these findings beyond the active site into other hot spots for missense mutations found in
the supporting loops and transmembrane helices. Interpreted within the context of high-resolution molecular
models, the results of this work will uncover the orchestrated pattern of conformational changes underpinning
catalysis as well as the thermodynamic and kinetic basis of inhibition induced by disease-linked mutations."
10812168,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease defined by the injury of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons at the optic nerve head,
leading to cell death and irreversible vision loss. Current therapies center around lowering intraocular pressure (IOP)
although this can be challenging in some patients. In order to advance towards a neuroprotective strategy that could
complement IOP-lowering, we have been identifying potential neuroprotective targets in primary RGCs using high-
throughput functional genomic screening. We initially identified dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK) and its paralog, leucine
zipper kinase (LZK) as being key upstream activators of JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) and axon injury signaling. We
showed that DLK/LZK inhibition provides robust and durable protection to RGCs in multiple rodent models of optic
neuropathy and, more recently, validated the survival effect in a nonhuman primate model of glaucoma. Despite their
central role as neuronal messengers of axonal injury, little is known about the regulation of DLK/LZK. Moreover, inhibition
of DLK/LZK prevents axon regeneration and has only modest effects on distal axon degeneration. Using chemical genetic-
and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-based screens, we have identified two subgroups of
Sterile 20 (STE20) kinases, including thousand and one amino acid (TAO) and germinal center kinase IV (GCK-IV) kinases
which seem to regulate the interpretation and duration of the DLK/LZK axon injury signal. Moreover, inhibition increases
rather than decreases axon regeneration and has a much greater impact on distal axonal degeneration. Based on insights
from cancer biology, we recognized that similar STE20 kinases converge to regulate Hippo signaling, a developmental
growth pathway not previously linked to axon injury signaling. We show that inhibition of the central kinases of Hippo
signaling, large tumor suppressor (LATS) 1 and 2, robustly protects primary mouse RGCs and we attempt to demonstrate
that the canonical Hippo transcription factor, transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) modulates
DLK/LZK signaling by affecting JUN-dependent transcription. The central theme of this proposal is that combinatorial
inhibition of STE20 kinases can be leveraged to generate robust somal and axonal protection combined with long-distance,
sustained axon regeneration and that a key molecular mechanism involves Hippo signaling. In Specific Aim 1 (SA1), we
focus on the role of STE20 kinases in axon degeneration and evaluate the potential for pancellular and functional RGC
protection in a rat model of glaucoma. For this, we built a novel all-in-one adeno-associated virus (AAV)/CRISPR reagent
capable of disrupting multiple kinases. In SA2, we test the role of combinatorial STE20 kinase inhibition in axon
regeneration. We also use transcriptomic assays to dissect the mechanism by which DLK/LZK and STE20 kinase inhibition
differs with respect to axon regeneration. Finally, in SA3, we explore the role of Hippo signaling in both mouse and human
RGC survival and its link to STE20 and DLK/LZK signaling. Together, we anticipate this proposal will lead to a robust
RGC neuroprotective strategy for combined axonal and somal preservation and a deeper understanding of the key axon
injury pathway in RGCs."

 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The UC Irvine (UCI) Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (CFCCC) Catchment Area is Orange County
(OC) which represents Region 10 of the California Cancer Registry and in which 70% of CFCCC cancer patients
reside. OC is the third most populous county in California and the sixth most populous county in the U.S. Nearly
two-thirds of county residents are from ethnically-diverse populations and 30% are foreign-born who speak a
total of more than 35 different languages at home. Poverty is higher in these OC populations, as 17% of Latinos,
13% of Vietnamese, 13% of African Americans, 13% of Koreans and 10% of Chinese have incomes below the
federal poverty line, compared to only 5% of non-Hispanic Whites. Geographically, the majority of these diverse
populations reside in central and north parts of OC. UCI is designated by the U.S. Department of Education as
both a Hispanic-Serving Institution and an Asian American/Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institution,
and we are the sole NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center based in the county.
The mission and long-range goal of the CFCCC's Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) is to reduce
cancer-related burdens in the Catchment Area through cancer monitoring, community outreach and education,
leadership on county coalitions and statewide partnerships including the California Cancer Plan, policy advocacy,
and facilitation of research that promotes cancer health equity within and beyond the Catchment Area. The
Specific Aims of the COE component are: 1) to identify and characterize the cancer burden in OC; 2) to partner
with community leaders and organizations for outreach education; and 3) to facilitate community engagement in
research. COE is led by Associate Director for Cancer Health Disparities & Community Engagement Sora Park
Tanjasiri, DrPH, MPH, a well-established cancer health disparities researcher with deep ties and relationships
throughout OC. The Office of COE is composed of a masters-level Director and two community health educators
who are supported by CFCCC funds under the authority of the Cancer Center Director. These staff engage in
activities covering the continuum of community engagement, including principles of community-based
participatory research, to establish and facilitate partnerships with community-based organizations, clinics, and
public agencies. Guided by both the overall CFCCC strategic plan and a COE-specific strategic plan, COE works
collaboratively with the Community Equity Board to identify cancer education needs and to deliver evidence-
based outreach education to address social, behavioral, and environmental risks within and beyond the
Catchment Area, including the California HPV Vaccination Roundtable and pivoting to address urgent COVID-
19 needs across Southern California. Since its inception, COE has strategically guided the design,

10816443,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The plaques and tangles of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) were first described over a century ago; we now know for
the first time that the proteins of these deposits are composed of Aβ and tau prions, respectively. Being able to
measure these two prions using rapid human cell bioassays in conjunction with transgenic rodent models, we
are now able to attack many areas of AD research that were previously inaccessible. We propose to expand
our cohort of 114 brain samples from patients with AD and other neurodegenerative diseases to more than
1,000 specimens from brain banks worldwide, including equal numbers of aged-matched and gender-matched
controls from cognitively normal subjects. We will survey the molecular profile of prion strains using a battery of
cell lines and proteomics and relate these findings to detailed neuropathology and whole genome sequencing
of every sample. Along these lines, we will also procure brain samples from upwards of 500 individuals with
Down syndrome (DS) because these people all develop cognitive impairment and AD neuropathology at very
young ages and have both Aβ and tau prions in their brains as we describe in this proposal. We will investigate
the influence of the APOE genotype status on the levels of Aβ and tau prions in the brains of AD and DS
patients, and perform mechanistic studies using human neural cells and humanized rodents. Importantly, we
plan to expand our studies on the induction of tau prions by Aβ prions using novel human cell and rodent
models on a background of different genetic risk factors. To identify the most relevant species of Aβ prions for
these experiments, we will create a broad repertoire of synthetic Aβ prions composed of different isoforms
informed by inherited AD mutations or genetic mosaicism as well as results from our proteomics data in human
tissue. Since studies of neural exosomes collected from patients with AD or DS show increased levels of Aβ
and tau proteins compared to controls, we plan to determine if these proteins are prions. If that proves to be
the case, then it may be possible to develop a more biologically relevant blood test for AD, which would have
enormous utility in the disease diagnosis and progression as well as the discovery of effective therapeutics.
Our collaborations described in this P01 will allow us to rapidly define the structural events that underlie the
molecular pathogenesis of AD as studied in this Project, which would seem critical to developing more effective
AD therapeutics."
10816447,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with the misfolding of tau and Aβ proteins. AD shares important molecular
characteristics with classical PrP prion diseases – particularly the misfolding of tau and Aβ into prions and
amyloids. It is known that tau misfolds differently in different tauopathies. Aβ is conformationally more
heterogeneous, although we have seen some correlations with clinical features. It is well established that AD
brain homogenates can seed tau and Aβ misfolding within cells and mouse brains. These models have informed
our understanding of disease progression and are widely used to develop therapeutics and imaging agents.
However, it is unclear how faithfully they reproduce the structure and activities of the originating patient-derived
strains. Given the potential for multiple structural isoforms, it is essential to ask whether these cellular and animal
systems reproduce the conformations of tau and Aβ found in AD patients. Thus, we will determine the fidelity of
strain transmission in cellular and animal models.
 We will examine propagation of a number of patient-derived and in vitro fibrillized conformational strains.
Our over-arching hypothesis is that in vitro strains will be less fit, and their conformations will change when
passaged in vivo. In contrast, we expect patient-derived amyloids to be more likely to retain their original strains,
although this might be influenced by AD genetic factors, including apo? subtypes and TREM2. In Aim 1) we
will develop rapid methods to footprint conformational strains. A) Bottom-up and top-down mass spectrometry
(MS) methods will be used to identify proteoforms. B) Limited proteolysis will identify structured regions. C)
Cross-linking MS will provide coarse-grained information concerning amyloid structures. D) Fluorescence
microscopy utilizing multiple fluorescent dyes will distinguish different conformational and structural forms.
 In Aims 2 and 3) we will determine the fidelity of transmission of tau prions through cellular and animal
models. We will passage synthetic and patient-derived tau prions through widely used HEK cell models, cultured
neurons, and Tg mice including ones expressing ApoE subtypes and TREM2 mutants. The fingerprints of these
strains will be evaluated before and after passage using methods in Aim 1. These studies will elucidate the
extent to which host environmental factors influence the transmission of tau and Aβ prions.
 Finally, in Aim 4) we will develop structural models of the TREM2-DAP12 signaling complex. TREM2 is
a membrane protein involved in microglial Aβ sequestration and processing. Its extracellular domain interacts
directly with amyloid surfaces, while its transmembrane domain binds to the transmembrane domain of its
signaling partner, DAP12. With Sali (Project 4) we are developing an integrative model for the signaling
complex, which will help elucidate the mechanism of microglial Aβ processing, providing potential new targets
for therapeutic intervention of AD."

Our Global Infectious Disease research training program has focused on mitigating leishmaniasis and other
vector-borne and emerging infectious diseases in Colombia and the Latin American Region through basic,
clinical, and translational research and training. The challenges of prevention and control of infectious diseases
in Colombia and other low and middle income countries, require innovation not only through discovery
research but also in the delivery of new interventions in diverse contexts. The overall goal of this renewal
application is to strengthen the investigator base in infectious disease research in CIDEIM and other
Colombian institutions and their research and training capacity to enable implementation of the results of
research on these diseases into practice. This will be achieved through: a) early research career development
of eight New Investigators and Junior Faculty as Global Infectious Disease (GID) Scholars and their
establishment as investigators in CIDEIM and other Colombian institutions, b) continuation of mentored
research and comprehensive research training of 4 Doctoral and 6 Clinical Research/MSc trainees and, c) by
integrating the principles of implementation science into both our GlD research training curriculum and
mentored trainee projects across the spectrum of basic to applied, biomedical, clinical and public health
research. In alliance with Yale University, the committed participation of national post-graduate programs in
biomedical and health sciences, together with a strong platform of funded research at CIDEIM and the ongoing
research of GID program faculty, the renewal of this program will continue to create synergies with national
and regional post-graduate programs in biomedical and health sciences through an integrative portfolio of post-
graduate elective web-based interinstitutional courses and seminars, workshops on leadership, mentorship,
and good research practices, and strategic use of communication technologies."
10816487,"Abstract
Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) is the largest long-term study of brain development and child
health in the United States. The ABCD Research Consortium consists of 21 research sites across the country,
a Coordinating Center, and a Data Analysis and Informatics Resource Center. In its first five years, under
RFA-DA-15-015, ABCD enrolled a diverse sample of 11,878 9-10 year olds from across the consortium, and
will track their biological and behavioral development through adolescence into young adulthood.
All participants received a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging,
neuropsychological testing, bioassays, careful assessment of substance use, mental health, physical health,
and culture and environment. A similar detailed assessment recurs every 2 years. Interim in-person annual
interviews and mid-year telephone or mobile app assessments provide refined temporal resolution of
developmental changes and life events that occur over time with minimal burden to participating youth and
parents. Intensive efforts are made to keep the vast majority of participants involved with the study through
adolescence and beyond, and retention rates thus far are very high. Neuroimaging has expanded our
understanding of brain development from childhood into adulthood. Using this and other cutting-edge
technologies, ABCD can determine how different kinds of youth experiences (such as sports, school
involvement, extracurricular activities, videogames, social media, unhealthy sleep patterns, and vaping)
interact with each other and with a child’s changing biology to affect brain development and social, behavioral,
academic, health, and other outcomes.
Data, securely and privately shared with the scientific community, will enable investigators to: (1) describe
individual developmental pathways in terms of neural, cognitive, emotional, and academic functioning, and
influencing factors; (2) develop national standards of healthy brain development; (3) investigate the roles and
interaction of genes and the environment on development; (4) examine how physical activity, sleep, screen
time, sports injuries (including traumatic brain injuries), and other experiences influence brain development; (5)
determine and replicate factors that influence mental health from childhood to young adulthood; (6)
characterize relationships between mental health and substance use; and (7) specify how use of substances
such as cannabis, alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine affects developmental outcomes, and how neural, cognitive,
emotional, and environmental factors influence the risk for adolescent substance use."
10816491,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall objective of this proposal is to infuse clinical inspired design throughout a biomedical engineering
curriculum. We propose to develop a summer clinical immersion program based on the value of multi-
disciplinary input and interactive student mentoring in problem finding. Deliverables from the summer
experience will impact courses throughout the curriculum by providing open-ended, problem-based case
studies that will engage aspects of design thinking and application of specific course material. The summer
experience will also seed projects for a senior design course, focused on the creation of medical device
prototypes and skills development that emphasize multidisciplinary communication. To promote co-learning
and the further integration of design across the curriculum, senior student teams will apply their learning to lead
workshop activities in other classes. This will serve to connect different level thinkers and experiences across
student cohorts. The proposed project has strong enthusiasm and commitment from established partnerships
between biomedical engineering faculty, clinicians in the College of Medicine, clinicians in the College of
Veterinary Medicine, industry leaders, and administration. Our goal is to emphasize translational opportunities
throughout the maturation of novice problem solvers to open-ended decision makers. Specifically, the new
summer clinical immersion experience will bi-directionally integrate the value of design thinking across the
department through the completion of the following inter-related aims:
 Aim 1: To develop and implement a summer clinical immersion program with multi-disciplinary input and
 enhanced student interaction.
 Aim 2: To seed fundamental biomedical engineering courses across the curriculum with clinically inspired
 design problems.
 Aim 3: To facilitate bidirectional co-learning to enhance the senior design and entire biomedical engineering
curriculum.
Biomedical engineering at UF is primed to make the proposed jump in design education based on over 40
established relationships with clinicians, the existing engagement of 13 industry partners, and a developing
curriculum that makes design integration possible. The proposed course and programmatic innovations will
provide a curriculum model that can be disseminated to other departments with the overall goal of enhancing
biomedical engineering design education to ensure students self-identity as clinical translators."
10840975,"Despite aggressive use of combination antiretroviral therapy, HIV infection is associated with cognitive and
neurobehavioral impairment, collectively termed neuroHIV. HIV and opiates are independently associated with
blood brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, alterations in inflammatory signaling, and cognitive and motor deficits.
The HIV viral protein Tat is thought to mediate much of the HIV-associated damage within the brain. This
proposal will use both a Tat transgenic mouse model and a murine tropic HIV-infected mouse model. The Tat
transgenic mouse model expresses HIV-1 Tat driven by a GFAP promotor, which limits expression to the CNS.
The two models will be used to examine the effects of HIV and morphine in vivo. Our central hypothesis is that
opiates compromise BBB function and contribute to neuropathology through complex mechanisms which
include enhancing paracellular flux, while paradoxically decreasing net flux of antiretrovirals across the barrier,
increasing infiltration of monocytes, and increasing inflammatory signals within the brain. We will address our
hypotheses with the following specific aims. Aim 1. Define the effects of opiates ± HIV-1 Tat and HIV infection
on BBB integrity and function and on region-specific impact on antiretrovirals and morphine concentrations
within the brain. Aim 2. Characterize regional differences in the interplay between opiates ± HIV/HIV-1 Tat and
ARVs on macrophage infiltration into the CNS and on proinflammatory cytokine production the CNS. These
studies will define and relate the effects of opiates and/or HIV-1 on regional drug accumulation, BBB integrity,
drug metabolism/efflux, and immune cell trafficking into and inflammatory signals within the brain. Better
understanding of this dynamic interplay, with specific focus on antiretroviral brain concentrations, will improve
the current therapeutic approaches for the HIV patients who use opioids (for licit or illicit use).
The long-term goal is to understand how opiates limit ARV therapeutic efficacy within the brain in the setting of
HIV and to identify targets for therapeutic development to eliminate the negative effects of opiates/HIV on
neurocognitive outcomes."
10817001,"An allergen-specific immune signature-directed diet vs sham diet for treatment of eosinophilic
esophagitis: A pilot-feasibility study
ABSTRACT
Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic disease defined by abnormal infiltration of eosinophils into the
esophageal mucosa, leading to dysphagia, progressive esophageal stenosis, and food impaction. The
incidence and prevalence are rising dramatically, and EoE is now a major cause of upper gastrointestinal
morbidity. Because EoE is allergen-mediated and triggered by foods, dietary elimination is the primary non-
pharmacologic treatment. However, the approach to dietary elimination is sub-optimal, burdensome, and time-
consuming. Currently available blood- or skin-based allergy tests do not reliably identify food triggers of EoE,
so multiple foods must be empirically removed from the diet. Adherence to these restrictive diets is difficult,
the same approach is used for all patients, and foods that are not eliminated may still be triggers. Multiple
endoscopies are required to identify triggers, and these invasive and costly procedures carry risks. Two major
issues must be addressed to allow widespread application of dietary therapy in EoE. First, if accurate allergy
tests were available, treatment could be personalized and streamlined. Foods likely to be triggers in an
individual patient could be eliminated, and foods unlikely to provoke eosinophilic inflammation could be
retained. Second, if non-invasive biomarkers were available to monitor treatment response, the need for
endoscopies could be greatly reduced. To begin to address these two major knowledge gaps, we developed a
novel allergen-specific immune signature to guide dietary elimination. This technique predicts food triggers
based on food-specific IgG4 levels in esophageal biopsies and CD4+ T-cell stimulation assays in peripheral
blood. In initial testing, this approach was more accurate than traditional skin-based allergy tests. We have
also identified a promising biomarker, eosinophil peroxidase (EPX), that can be measured in the serum and
tracks with treatment response as measured on esophageal biopsies. The proposed study has been designed
to be highly responsive to PAS 20-160, a new “small R01” mechanism that encourages pilot/feasibility clinical
trials that lay the foundation for larger trials. To generate key data to estimate effect sizes, we will conduct a
pilot randomized clinical trial of the allergen-specific immune signature-directed diet elimination vs sham diet
elimination with the following specific aims: 1) To estimate the effect of allergen-specific immune signature-
directed dietary elimination compared to sham elimination on esophageal eosinophil counts and symptoms of
dysphagia in patients with EoE; and 2) To assess serum EPX as a non-invasive biomarker and estimate effect
sizes for monitoring dietary elimination treatment response in patients with EoE. This innovative pilot/feasibly
trial will be conducted by an existing multidisciplinary team with recognized expertise in EoE, clinical trials, food
allergy, pathology, and translational science. It will ultimately lead to a major clinical impact on the treatment
and monitoring of EoE by individualizing dietary elimination and streamlining monitoring of dietary elimination
using non-invasive biomarkers, so patients can avoid the time, effort, and risk of empiric dietary elimination."
10817007,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This application proposes to translate activatable fluorophores targeted to cytosolic phospholipase A2α
(cPLA2α) for intraoperative surgical detection in lung cancer. Lung cancer is the leading cancer-related cause
of death and the third most diagnosed cancer in the United States. Non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC),
represent 90% of lung cancers, and surgical resection continues to be the most effective approach to cure
patients with low stage premetastatic disease. Surgeons typically use visual inspection and finger palpation to
define solid tumor margins. However, this approach is often insufficient to detect residual disease, leading to
recurrence in up to 40% of patients and significantly reduced 5-year survival.
Improving intraoperative detection of tumor margins is imperative, because small foci of residual disease at or
close to the resection margins are the most common cause of local recurrence. The most important prognostic
indicator following cancer surgery is complete resection, which prolongs patient survival and improves post-
surgical quality of life. Contrast enhancement of tumors using near-infrared (NIR) imaging with targeted
fluorophores can identify small lesions that are not detectable by visual observation or palpation. NIR imaging
offers high resolution and sensitivity and can be performed in real-time during surgery.
In this application, we propose to translate DDAO-arachidonate (DDAO-A), an activatable probe designed to
specifically target cPLA2α, a critical signaling enzyme upregulated early in tumorigenesis and overexpressed
in more than 47% of NSCLC. Preliminary Studies indicate that DDAO-A is selectively activated by murine and
human NSCLC tumors, and can detect small foci in both mouse models and excised human lung tumor tissue.
DDAO-A will be synthesized under GLP conditions and dispersed in clinically approved liposomal formulations
for delivery. Selected mouse studies will be performed to confirm probe activation, tumor targeting and the
ability to detect tumor margins. Systemic toxicity will be evaluated in mice and in a small cohort of canines. We
will utilize an established platform for clinical translation of NIR fluorophores, employing a canine clinical trial
for intraoperative surgery. We will recruit a patient cohort of 30 companion animals with spontaneous NSCLC
presenting to our Veterinary School.
DDAO-A will be used for detection of primary tumors and identification of tumor margins during intraoperative
fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) in canine patients. We will investigate both systemic injection and topical
application for detection of residual tumor. These data will be compared to control surgical cohorts using the
non-targeted indocyanine green (ICG) or without NIR fluorescence guidance. If successful, this study will
improve surgical outcomes by improving localization of small tumor deposits in the lung, lymph nodes and
margins. The completion of these studies will form the basis for an investigational new drug (IND) application
in support of a clinical trial to assess DDAO-A-guided surgery in human lung cancer patients."
10877776,"Project Summary/Abstract:
 Inflammation has long been known to increase risk of tumorigenesis. Epithelial barrier tissues are
perpetually exposed to a myriad of environmental and inflammatory insults that necessitates robust regenerative
capacity of their tissue-specific epithelial stem cells (EpSCs) to restore barrier integrity. The long term
consequences of these inflammatory encounters on the tissue and EpSCs is poorly understood. Here, I seek to
understand how exposure to inflammation results in epigenetic and cellular rewiring of EpSCs and their lineages
in different barrier tissues and how this rewiring can be maladaptive leading to increased cancer susceptibility.
 The F99 phase of this proposal is focused on the mechanisms by which inflammatory experience is
encoded within the chromatin of skin epithelial stem cells (EpSCs) and how inflammation-experienced skin
accelerates tumor formation. I have begun to uncover the molecular mechanisms of how EpSCs acquire and
maintain chromatin accessibility at key domains associated with stress response genes that contribute to an
inflammatory response. My studies suggest that this phenomenon occurs through the complex and dynamic
interplay between transcription factors (TFs) that are naturally present in steady state EpSCs but cannot gain
access to stress response enhancers without inflammation-induced TFs. As I unearth the molecular mechanisms
involved, I will interrogate how this inflammatory rewiring of skin EpSCs epigenome accelerates tumor formation
as EpSCs acquire oncogenic mutations that lead to squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), a life-threatening,
metastatic cancer for which there are few effective therapies. At the completion of the F99 phase, l will have
gained strong experience in in vivo high-throughput epigenetics, mouse genetics and epithelial stem cell biology,
and transition to a postdoc to gain advanced expertise and training in human cancer and immunology.
 For the K00 phase, I will shift my focus to how inflammatory experience can reshape colonic epithelium
composition in the gut and how this reshaping, along with EpSC epigenetic rewiring, results in colorectal cancer
(CRC). Interestingly, colitis can result in colitis-induced CRC that follows a different molecular driven
pathogenesis than traditional CRC. Thus, to further understand the mechanisms that drive colitis-induced CRC,
I plan to expand my technical expertise to include colitis-induced CRC modeling, single-cell epigenomic and
transcriptomic techniques, genetic screening and human organoid modeling. These new approaches coupled
with my already strong background in molecular biology and high-throughput genomic analyses, will allow me to
address the most pressing and challenging issues in inflammation experience and cancer biology today. With
the aid of this award, I intend to continue my research contribution and gain the necessary experience to become
an Assistant Professor at a major academic institution. There I will head my own lab and guide my students in
epithelial cancer research with the ultimate goal of finding new targets to treat these aggressive cancers."

Despite significant efforts to limit youth from accessing and using electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), many
adolescents and young adults are directly purchasing e-cigarettes from brick-and mortar retail stores. Studies

and regulatory solutions: (1) Examine adolescents’ and young adults’ descriptions of e-cigarette marketing in
the retail environment and its influence on their e-cigarette purchase and use behavior. (2) Identify the most
important, appealing characteristics intrinsic to e-cigarette marketing in the retail environment influencing
adolescents’ and young adults’ intentions to purchase and use e-cigarettes. (3) AIM 3. Develop and evaluate
the effectiveness of an e-cigarette counter-marketing lesson combating marketing in the retail environment to
reduce intent to use and actual use of e-cigarettes among adolescents. In the K99 phase, focus group
discussions (Aim 1) and surveys including an embedded discrete-choice experiment (Aim 2) will identify how
and which e-cigarette marketing characteristics influence adolescent and young adult e-cigarette purchase and
use. Aims 1 and 2 will identify which characteristics require counter-marketing and would benefit from
strengthened regulation. In the R00 phase, a randomized controlled trial will randomly assign adolescents-only
to one of two conditions: 1) an online counter-marketing lesson about e-cigarette marketing in the retail
environment (developed in this phase) or 2) an existing online e-cigarette overview lesson to assess influence
on adolescents' intent to use and actual use of e-cigarettes (Aim 3). This Award and proposed research will
enable the PI to grow expertise in impactful e-cigarette prevention programs and policy solutions to reduce
adolescent tobacco use, a long-term goal. A training plan involving mentorship from multidisciplinary tobacco
control experts in tobacco prevention, marketing, policy, survey design, statistical methods and counter-
marketing design, and complementary didactic training will fill gaps in knowledge of tobacco regulatory science
and vital research skills, allowing the PI to transition to an independent investigator. By utilizing preliminary
data and leveraging new skills, the PI will submit a R01 grant that will examine a multi-component intervention
to combat marketing, which will substantially reduce adolescents’ and young adults’ e-cigarette use."

Covira Surgical, Inc. is developing a first-in-class agent for preventing chemotherapy-related
gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities and lethal infections. Chemotherapy renders patients more susceptible to
infection - many if most of which originate from the gastrointestinal track flora. Chemotherapy causes a major
disruption in the gastrointestinal tract structure (i.e., mucosal ulceration, loss of tight junction permeability,
submucosal edema, inflammatory cell infiltrations, etc.) and microbiome (i.e., dysbiosis). As a result,
chemotherapy induced GI tract toxicity can lead to treatment disruptions, potential cancer progression, additional
hospitalizations, and increased mortality. Compared to the general population, cancer patients have a mortality
rate of fatal infections almost three times higher. Given these facts, infection is considered one of the most
serious chemotherapy-related toxicities and many, if not most patients receive antibiotics during the course of
their chemotherapy which can lead to further acquisition of antibiotics resistant strains of bacteria. Therefore,
there is an urgent need for novel therapies to help reduce chemotherapy-related GI toxicities and infections that
do not involve the addition of broader and more powerful antibiotics.
Covira Surgical, Inc. intends to address this urgent need by developing a first-in-class agent capable of
preserving the beneficial effects of the gut microbiome while suppressing its harmful effects. The gut microbiome
plays a key role in modulating chemotherapy-related toxicity and efficacy, drug metabolism, and tumor
microenvironment. Our agent – CS-0003 – is a novel, orally administered, non-antibiotic phosphate-rich
mucoadhesive polyethylene glycol. CS-0003 can promote the retention and growth of the native microbiome
while suppressing the proliferation and dissemination of lethal pathogens from the gut. CS-0003 provides
microbes with a readily available source of phosphate while physically shielding bacteria away from the
endothelial surface, thus behaving as a surrogate mucin that cannot be absorbed. This approach allows the gut
microbiome to positively influence the immune system and GI tract. Our animal studies to date have
demonstrated that CS-0003 is distributed along the entire GI tract and is safe and well-tolerated. Successful
completion of this Phase I project will demonstrate that CS-0003 is safe and efficacious in ameliorating
chemotherapy-induced toxicity and infection in mice treated with two common chemotherapeutic agents."
10821632,"Thrombosis is a leading cause of death and disability in the United States. While
conventional treatment methods for thrombosis carry high-risks side effects, non-invasive
ultrasound treatments have shown promise, especially when microbubbles are included to
enhance lysis rates at lower ultrasound intensities. However, the physics behind microbubble
enhanced thrombolysis involves complex and inter-coupled mechanisms, such as bubble and
structure dynamics, bubble cloud, bubble-flow, and cloud-clot interactions. As a result, the
biophysics of microbubble enhanced thrombolysis remains poorly understood, which poses a
major barrier to effective clinical applications.
 To address this challenge, this proposed SBIR project aims to develop a biophysics-
based numerical platform for the accurate characterization of microbubble-enhanced
ultrasound and its interaction with blood clots, as well as the resultant clot removal. This
platform will allow for the accurate prediction of clot lysis rates under various operating
conditions such as bubble size, concentrations, and ultrasonic properties etc. Innovation will
center on overcoming the technical challenges of meeting performance requirements for both
accuracy and efficiency, by incorporating multi-scale, multi-discipline physics into a
systematical multi-material modeling framework, along with significant speedup through novel
High Performance Computing scheme developments. The proposed efforts will extend the
capabilities of a previous in-house, viscous compressible multi-material flow solver that was
demonstrated in microbubble-enhanced high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for tumor
ablations. Essential new development will be to incorporate appropriate strain stress relations
to consider the viscoelastic properties of blood clots and integrate a two-way coupled Discrete
Singularity Model for microbubbles to capture nonlinear bubble cloud dynamics and its
interaction with acoustic fields and evolving structures. This single-code strategy will avoid the
drawback of coupling different codes, which poses a barrier to biomedical researchers for
clinical applications. In addition, the simulations will be greatly accelerated by High
Performance Computing schemes to be fast enough to be practical for real-world problems.
 This project has the potential to significantly benefit the health and welfare of millions of
people in the United States and around the world by accelerating and promoting the wide
clinical applications of microbubble -enhanced sonothrombolysis. This will greatly reduce risks
and enhance the efficiency of conventional FDA-approved sonothrombolysis."

Project 1: Evolution and Durability of allo(auto)immune B cell responses in organ transplant recipients
Antibodies (Abs), which are produced by B lineage-derived Ab secreting cells (ASCs) following pathogen
exposure and vaccination, play critical roles in protection from infection. However, ASCs and Abs can be
pathogenic if directed against the wrong target, as is the case for autoimmune disease and organ transplantation.
In the setting of kidney transplant (KT), Abs made by the recipient directed against the donor's Major
Histocompatibility Complex or Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) proteins (donor-specific Ab, DSA) contribute to
Ab-mediated rejection (AMR). Pre-formed DSA at the time of transplant can cause acute AMR and de novo DSA,
which is elicited months to years after transplantation, can cause chronic AMR. Both conditions are difficult to
treat and associated with organ failure. Thus, while overall transplant success rates have improved, there is still
a need to better understand the fundamental mechanisms that control the development, evolution and
durability of the B cell and B cell-derived DSA responses against donor (allo) HLA Class-I and Class-II. In fact,
we know remarkably little about B cell responses to alloHLA proteins, which unlike pathogen-derived antigens,
are very similar to the HLA proteins expressed by the patient (selfHLA). Studies using Rituximab to deplete
circulating B cells in DSA+ transplant patients reveal that DSA levels remain high in many patients. These data
support the idea that the DSA response is largely driven by Rituximab-resistant long-lived bone marrow ASCs
(LL-ASC). However, memory B cells (Bmem), particularly those that reside in tissues, are also more resistant to
Rituximab and both Bmem and LL-ASCs are formed by germinal center (GC) B cell responses that can take
place in lymphoid and inflamed tissues. Bmem, which can rapidly differentiate into new cohorts of ASCs, could
potentially serve as a reservoir to sustain systemic Ab responses. We found that HLA-reactive Bmem were
present in the blood and kidney of a DSA+ KT patient diagnosed with AMR. These HLA-specific B cells were
present in expanded B cell lineages and the BCRs expressed by these B cells were high affinity, class-switched
and extensively somatically mutated, suggesting that they were generated via a TFH-dependent GC response.
Moreover, we observed extensive clonal relationships between the Bmem and ASCs in both tissues and we
identified Bmem and ASCs lineages that contributed to the serum DSA response. Intriguingly, many of the
recombinant monoclonal Abs derived from multiple HLA-reactive B cell lineages bound both donor alloHLA and
selfHLA. Therefore, we hypothesize that ongoing evolution of the alloHLA B cell response occurs in the face of
a durable low affinity selfHLA response, which is not censored. The immediate goals of Project 1 are to: (i) define
the B cell populations in blood and kidney that contribute to HLA reactivity, and (ii) determine how the kidney
and recirculating alloHLA reactive B cells evolve with time and following immune perturbations. We believe these
experiments are important as gaining a more complete understanding of how B cell responses to alloHLA are
initiated and maintained may, in the future, allow for better design of therapies to prevent or treat AMR."

Project 3: Evolution, dynamics and durability of B cell and antibody responses in lung transplantation
Emerging data suggest that, like lung-resident memory T cells, memory B cells can reside in the lung without
recirculating and act as first responders to pulmonary pathogens like influenza and SARS-CoV-2. We termed
these cells lung-resident memory B cells or BRM cells. We also showed that lung-resident memory B cells require
contact with antigen within the lung in order to initiate their residency program. Taken together, these data
suggest that BRM cells are an important component of immunity to pulmonary pathogens. However we have
only a rudimentary understanding of where BRM cells come from, how they are selected, what antigens they
react with and how they are recalled (or not) after vaccination or secondary infection. Although lung-resident
memory B cells are clearly generated in response to pulmonary infection, it is less clear whether they are
generated in response to other types of antigens like auto-antigens or allo-antigens. Interestingly, many
pulmonary diseases, like COPD, IPF and ILD, have an autoimmune component in some patients, perhaps as a
consequence of persistent inflammation. Moreover, allo-reactive antibodies are often observed in lung transplant
patients. Given that auto-antigens and allo-antigens are widely expressed in the lung tissue, it makes sense that
lung-resident B cells will respond to these antigens in the lung. Our overall hypothesis is that allo-reactive, auto-
reactive and pathogen-reactive B cells in lung allografts are primed and selected locally in the lung, and that the
signals and cellular interactions involved in this process are different than those in conventional secondary
lymphoid organs. To test this hypothesis, we will take advantage of single cell methods that allow us to define
(and compare) individual B cells in blood, bronchalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lung tissue by a combination of
transcriptome (single cell RNseq), BCR clonotype (single cell BCRseq), DNA-barcoded antibodies to surface
markers (CITEseq) and affinity/specificity/cross-reactivity of BCRs cloned and expressed as recombinant
antibodies (single cell cloning). We will also use high-dimensional antigen arrays of HLA alleles, auto-antigens,
and virus-derived antigens to quantify the reactivity of antibodies in the blood and BAL fluid of lung transplant
patients. Using these methods to compare populations of auto-reactive, allo-reactive and virus-reactive-specific
B cells in the lung, BAL and blood over time and, in some cases, after infection, we will be able to determine how
memory B cells in the lung are related to one another, the depth of their selection, the extent of their cross-
reactivity and their ability to respond to local antigens. This information will be informative about the evolution of
donor-specific antibodies in the context of lung transplant, the potential role of auto-antibodies in the lungs of
transplant patients and the ability of pre-formed, virus-reactive (DONOR) B cells retained in donor lungs as they
respond to infection."

a
Exposure to dermal corrosives can occur during production, transport, use, and disposal of chemicals and
products. Such goods are manufactured and transported all over the world to different destinations, and the
transport of hazardous materials increases the likelihood of injury to the skin through improper chemical
release. New laws are being implemented that ban or severely limit the use of live animals for routine product
testing. Available nonanimal tests do not accurately identify dermal corrosives and no test for corrosives is
either high throughput or can be used in the field. There is thus a need for a nonanimal high-throughput
laboratory and field test to identify dermal corrosives; the subject of this proposal. Our preliminary research
discovered that a measurable change in the molecular structure of a marker protein predicts if a material has
the potential to damage and degrade human skin. Based on this finding, an ""in chemico"" (cell free, shelf stable)
test chemistry was developed, a patent application has been submitted, and preliminary ""kits"" have been
assembled (both a field test ""kit"" and a high-throughput laboratory test ""kit""). The procedure involves adding
the material to be tested to a tube filled with a proprietary molecular marker for skin corrosion, incubating the
material at room temperature, and then adding a colorimetric reagent to measure the extent of conformational
change of the molecular marker and quantification using either a laboratory plate reader (high-throughput
laboratory method) or a portable spectrophotometric pipette (field method). This measured change is then
compared with the controls, and a ""corrosion score"" is calculated. The corrosion score is then applied to a
prediction model, and the test material is classified as a skin corrosive or noncorrosive. Initial studies
comparing results from the in chemico test with historical databases of live animal skin corrosion studies
(""Draize Test"" data) indicate the test has very high predictivity. This project will confirm the accuracy and
configuration of the test as a portable kit, and a transferability study will be conducted by three laboratories.
The outcome of this project will be a new, rapid, easy-to-use method that does not use animals and will
accurately determine if an unknown chemical or material corrodes and damages the skin."

People with Down syndrome (DS) have a 75-90% lifetime risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD).2,3
However, there is marked variability in the timing of AD, with a 30+ year range in the age of onset of clinical
dementia8, suggesting that factors beyond trisomy 21 may influence AD in DS. Outside of DS, mid-life obesity
or being overweight is an identified risk factor for later life AD, such that efforts to reduce body mass index
(BMI) and increase physical activity have been proposed to be promising AD prevention programs. Adults with
DS are at risk for being overweight and obese40--42, yet virtually nothing is known about whether mid-life BMI is
associated with the timing of AD pathology and symptomology in DS. To date, studies examining BMI and AD
in DS have focused on BMI after a clinical AD dementia diagnosis,49,51 used primarily cross-sectional
methods,49,50 and/or relied on small sample sizes.51 The proposed F31 will provide training on advanced
statistical analytic methods to assess longitudinal data, grow my knowledge on the valid assessment of AD
pathology and cognition in DS, and develop professional skills for engaging in multisite research consortiums.
The project will leverage already existing data to address three specific aims: 1) evaluate the effect of BMI and
weight change on AD biomarkers (PET Aβ and tau PET) across 36 months, 2) examine the effect of BMI and
weight change on cognitive performance (episodic memory, executive functioning, motor planning and control,
and dementia symptoms) and clinical dementia status (cognitively stable, mild cognitive impairment, and
dementia) across 36 months, and 3) explore if inflammatory biomarkers (serum c-reactive protein, IL-6, IL-10,
and tumor necrosis factor alpha) are related to BMI and mediate the link between BMI and AD pathology and
cognitive decline. This work will help me launch an independent program of research on healthy aging in DS
that can inform social policy and intervention for preventing or delaying AD in DS and other at-risk populations."

All of Us represents a unique resource to understand the genetic, environmental, and social determinants of
complex traits across the broad diverse US population. All of Us encompasses underrepresented sexual and
gender, racial and ethnic minorities, living in urban and rural areas. Currently whole-genome sequence data
(WGS) is available on close to 100,000 subjects with 250,000 subjects expected by summer.
Human disease is a complex interplay between both genes and environment. A better understanding of how
disease is modified by genetic interactions with environmental, lifestyle and treatment factors as well as age,
sex, and ancestry, will provide insights into prevention, early intervention, and potential therapeutic strategies
to reduce the burden of disease and health disparities.
Cardiometabolic traits such a BMI, glucose levels, lipid levels, blood pressure are important determinants
cardiovascular disease. Understanding the genetic and environmental differences between ethnic groups is an
essential component to understanding disease prevalence. We know traits can have different heritability
across ethnic groups, shaped by thousands of years of independent evolution. This evolution is seen in the All
of US WGS where ~12% of the markers are multi-allelic, thus, representing different alternate alleles that
arose in different populations, each with a potentially different biological effect.
To be able to understand how the genetic and environmental architecture of complex traits differs between All
of Us ethnic groups we need workflows in the Researcher Workbench that can model diverse sources of
genetic variation from variance component models to genome-wide association with and without environmental
interactions. To achieve this understanding, we propose three aims.
In Aim 1 we develop models that can incorporate multiple traits, multiple exposures, and multiple ethnic strata
to be able to quantify the trait genetic and environmental architecture within and between ethnic groups.
In Aim 2 we develop and implement rigorously tested workflows for the tools developed in Aim 1 into the All of
Us Researcher Workbench. The workflows will be supported by with extensive training materials that will
include video tutorials, user manuals, and example data sets and instructions how to analyze them.
In Aim 3 we apply our All of Us Researcher Workbench workflows to investigate the genetic and environmental
architecture of cardiometabolic traits across All of Us ethnic groups. These traits will include lipids, glucose,
blood pressure and BMI. Environmental exposures will include smoking, education, and physical activity.
Our Researcher Workbench workflows will enable researchers to apply the same models to the extensive list
of clinical phenotypes and exposures available in All of Us to address sources of important health disparities."

 Drug-resistant infectious diseases pose a significant threat to public health. To overcome this challenge, drug
susceptibility testing (DST) is essential for identifying the most effective drugs to treat and monitoring drug
resistance in these diseases. Pyrazinamide (PZA) is a critical component of current tuberculosis (TB) treatment,
shortening drug susceptible TB (DS-TB) treatment duration from 9-12 months to 6 months. PZA is also used in
multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) treatment. Unfortunately, PZA resistance is increasing, with a pooled
prevalence of PZA resistance among all TB cases estimated at 16.2%, leading to worse consequences, including
death. Unlike other TB drugs, current PZA susceptibility tests are unreliable, complicated, and expensive, leading
to underutilization, even in high TB burden areas. Misclassifying PZA-resistant infections as PZA-susceptible
infections results in significantly worse clinical outcomes for the patients and development of further drug
resistance. Conversely, considering PZA-susceptible infections as PZA-resistant infection leads to longer
treatment with more expensive and toxic medicines unnecessarily. The global burden of PZA-resistant TB is
estimated at 1.4 million new cases out of 10.6 million active TB cases per year, highlighting a significant
challenge for current TB control. According to the CDC, treatment costs for DR-TB are significantly higher than
for DS-TB, at times, costing $528,000 (2020 USD) more to treat a patient with DR-TB than to treat a patient with
DS-TB. Due to the importance of PZA in many TB regimens, the emergence of PZA resistance and systematic
problems in current PZA DST, reliable PZA susceptibility testing has been assigned a high priority in the target
product profile by the WHO. To address this challenge, it is urgent to develop a rapid, reliable and accurate PZA
DST that can be routinely performed in mycobacterial labs worldwide. This will ensure that TB patients receive
the most effective and adequate treatment, prevent the further development of TB drug resistance and limit its
spread. Our goal is to develop such a test, which is substantiated by our preliminary findings indicating that (1)
PZA is active in liquid and agar media at pH 6.8, which is optimal for the growth of M. tuberculosis, unlike the
current acidic conditions that are unstable when bacteria grow, leading to a high rate of false resistance and
technical difficulties; (2) The new testing can determine the critical proportion of PZA-resistant M. tuberculosis
highly correlated with treatment outcomes, with one of the important specifications of DST at 1%, compared with
10% for the current test; (3) The new PZA susceptibility testing can be conducted without the need for expensive
readout equipment, which is a significant improvement from current test such as the BACTEC MGIT 960 PZA
that relies completely on such equipment; (4) the turnaround time for the new test is much shorter, with results
being obtained in ten days, compared to the BACTEC MGIT 960 PZA that takes up to 21 days. Therefore, the
proposed study is feasible and will fill a significant gap in TB DST, boosting the interpretation of rapid molecular
drug resistance predication and Driving basic research in PZA. The completion of the study will provide a useful
tool that has a significant positive impact on public health."

Embrient proudly presents its “Developing a Novel Incubator to Increase Cell Culture Reproducibility” grant.
For years, Embrient (and its predecessor company) has been addressing a problem bedeviling researchers
worldwide: “how can I culture my cells in a static, unchanging environment, instead of an environment that
changes unpredictably and potentially sabotages my experiment?”
Embrient's 50-year-old flagship product, the MIC-101, is a sealed incubation chamber that has admirably served
researchers investigating malaria, HIV, and even recent Nobel Prize laureates studying hypoxia-inducible factors
(HIF). The “flying saucer-shaped” chamber has been cited extensively in the scientific literature for over 50 years.
However, it has limited functionality and is somewhat difficult-to-use. Despite the MIC-101's proud history, the
time has come to replace it.
With this grant, Embrient aims to revolutionize incubator technology by developing a continuous flow
incubator that is virtually impregnable to typical outside perturbations, such as checking daily cell growth and
health, multiple users, contamination, and fluctuations in CO2, O2, and other gas mixtures. Embrient has
secured five patents for its pioneering incubator design that employs an ""Air Veil"" to insulate the interior
conditions from external influences.
A major issue coming from the NIH, researchers and incubator manufacturers alike has been, “how to increase
reproducibility of experiments over time and across labs?” Embrient's groundbreaking incubator directly
addresses this concern. Instead of “putting up with” currently marketed incubators that can take up to 50
minutes of “recovery time” after door openings and disturbances, Embrient's recovery time (subject to testing
and optimization to be performed in this grant), can be near zero.
To achieve this, Embrient will apply air barrier principles using laminar flow, already proven in large scale
applications such as commercial refrigerated (or heated) spaces, adapted to meet the unique needs of an
incubator.
This means cell culture experiments can achieve consistent human body and other conditions without the wide
fluctuations that plague current market incubators. Embrient can make a dramatic improvement in the way cell
culture is performed in laboratories worldwide, and thus make a major advance in research results."

Single cell genomics has become an essential tool to explore cellular heterogeneity, understand what makes
cells different from each other or in their response to disease and search for cells with valuable therapeutic
properties. Despite tremendous advances in the technologies enabling single cell analysis, combining
sequencing based genomic analysis and more traditional imaging-based cellular assays remains a challenge.
Many projects require to combine several technologies to collect both phenotyping and genotyping information,
making experimental design and execution as well as result interpretation challenging. To overcome these
limitations and allow the direct measurement and correlation of a cell’s phenotype, physiological conditions and
molecular signatures, Flexomics is developing the next generation of cell analysis platform combining imaging
and sequencing-based readouts. Our proprietary platform uses a high-density picowell array specifically
designed for single cell isolation and fluorescent imaging of the captured cells combined with a unique high-
throughput nucleic-acid barcoding system that can be deciphered both by fluorescence microscopy and by
sequencing. This approach allows us to implement gold-standard image-based functional assays to measure
and correlate live cell responses and sequencing data for 100,000s individual cells in parallel. Building on our
promising feasibility result, we propose to demonstrate the flexibility, deployability and commercial potential of
our platform by: (1) demonstrating the ability of our platform to select for cells with specific phenotypes to be
enriched for sequencing analysis, (2) building the required data processing, visualization tools and user interface
combining imaging and sequencing data necessary for the deployment of our platform, (3) generating proof of

sensitive measurement of representative toxic VOCs in air. This Phase II study will further
optimize the designs and fabrication of key micro GC components developed in Phase I and
create a commercial prototype. Micro GC method development and validation for additional toxic
VOCs, as well as pilot testing, will also be pursued in Phase II. The final product will be a plug-
and-play toxic VOC monitor with online sampling and onboard calibration capabilities.
 Toxic or even carcinogenic VOCs can be emitted into the workplace and environment from
many industrial and chemical processes, posing a serious health hazard to workers as well as
the general public. Therefore, there is a critical need for sensitive and accurate monitoring of VOC
exposure in real time or near real time. Unfortunately, existing approaches are associated with
major limitations due to the lack of specificity (e.g., colorimetric detection tubes and
photoionization sensors), or because of the requirement of a bulky/expensive instrument or offline
sampling (e.g., traditional GC methods). The proposed micro GC aims to overcome these
drawbacks and address the critical needed for autonomous, continuous, and specific monitoring
of VOC exposure."
10820671,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chromosomal Instability (CIN) and loss of the short arm of chromosome 17 (17p) are interrelated and relatively
common characteristics of many advanced, metastatic cancers. Though these genetic alterations are likely to
contribute to synthetic lethalities, the genetic dependencies resulting from CIN and 17p loss have not been
extensively identified or explored. A whole-genome CRISPR/Cas9 screen performed in our lab comparing
primary and metastatic-derivative cell lines revealed that metastatic tumors, which possess higher rates of
chromosomal instability, are more sensitive to inhibition of mitotic regulators associated with chromosome
segregation. Knockout of one such regulator, NDE1, selectively inhibited the growth of metastatic, CIN-high
cell lines in vitro, and in vivo. Interestingly, dependence on NDE1 is highly correlated with loss of 17p across
cell lines in the DepMap database, indicating that both CIN and 17p loss may contribute to NDE1 sensitivity.
We hypothesize that inhibiting NDE1 may be an effective way to target cancers harboring 17p loss and
increased CIN through a unique, dual action mechanism involving the buildup of errors in faithful chromosome
segregation, and synthetic lethality with an NDE1 paralog and binding partner, both of which are located on
17p. To test this central hypothesis, I propose defining the relationship between NDE1 dependence, 17p loss,
and chromosomal instability, characterizing the role of NDE1 in proper chromosome segregation, and
assessing the therapeutic potential of targeting NDE1 in the context of CIN and 17p loss."

Retinal cell health is a vital aspect of ophthalmic biology allowing us to see the world around us every day.
Degeneration of the retina and/or retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a central cause of numerous clinical eye
disorders such as age-related macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa, or glaucoma. Recent investigation
into disease etiology has implicated oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction as key players in the initiation
of an unhealthy retina. More specifically, analysis of primary tissue from human donors have shown increases
in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in these samples. This study uses novel pre-clinical models to test the
hypothesis that impaired mitochondrial function due to mtDNA damage results in age-related retinal and RPE
degeneration. To address this hypothesis we are utilizing polymerase gamma (Pol γ) as a tool to study the impact
of mtDNA mutation burden on retinal health in both animal and cellular models. Previously developed mutated
versions of Pol γ have shown to drastically increase mtDNA mutation rate, rendering this an effective method to
analyze the impact mtDNA mutations have on specific biological mechanisms. The goal of this proposal is to
determine the contribution mtDNA damage has on the onset and progression of retinal degeneration. This study
will pinpoint how mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress driven by mtDNA mutations promote an
unhealthy state of the retina. Successful completion of this study will not only offer deeper mechanistic
understanding of retinal disease, but may also open a novel avenue for therapeutic targeting."
10822698,"Using an Inclined Plane System to Triage TBI Patients
Project Summary: Traumatic brain injury (TBI), such as that experienced in blast injuries and collisions, can
vary in severity and be difficult to detect. Mild TBI makes up the majority of brain injuries, but it is the hardest to
diagnose; many cases go undiagnosed because these mild brain injuries are not detectable on a CT scan.
Although it is labeled “mild,” untreated TBI can result in physical and emotional symptoms that affect a
person’s quality of life. Current diagnostic methods rely on a doctor’s judgement to determine the severity of an
injury and the treatment plan. The doctor often relies on the patient’s own recounting of the past trauma and
their symptoms, but this subjective method is not ideal given its lack of precision and the risks of undiagnosed
and untreated TBI. Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved two biomarkers
(indicators) of brain trauma. After an impact to the brain, the body releases a high concentration of these
biomarkers, and the concentration level in a person’s blood can indicate the severity of brain damage and can
be monitored over time. Unfortunately, to identify and quantify these circulating biomarkers in a blood sample,
expensive instrumentation is needed that is not available in all hospitals, and especially not in remote areas or
for field care. Further, laboratory results can take a long time to process and coordinate, making this
information difficult to obtain in bedside and emergency situations.
We need a point-of-care device that can quickly detect elevated biomarker levels to diagnose and monitor the
severity of TBI. To address this, we are developing an innovative device that will use micro-engineering
methods (microbeads and microfluidic channels) to capture specific TBI biomarkers directly from a whole blood
sample. At the end of our project, we will have a portable platform capable of identifying and monitoring mild
TBI in diverse settings (e.g., battlefield, rural clinics, athletic field, hospitals). This disposable device will be
designed to fit in a pocket and generate a biomarker concentration report in minutes, helping medics and
doctors make quick decisions in emergency situations. Further, the device will provide quantitative data that
can be monitored over time to determine patient recovery and response to medication. It could help increase
the chance of a patient’s survival, both by quickly identifying TBI and monitoring the response to varying
treatments. In a research setting, it could also be useful to study a patient’s response to the effect of novel TBI
drug therapies and could help lead to the development of new medicines. In the future, the platform could be
further customized to identify other biomarkers to detect different illnesses/injuries."

With the advent of fluorescence probes targeting specific cellular and subcellular events, the role
of fluorescent imaging in preclinical arena is getting rapidly stronger. Fluorescence probes mainly
consist of the active component, which interacts with the target, and the reporting component
such as the fluorescent dye. Operating in the near-infrared spectrum in which the tissue
absorption is minimum, these probes can be detected in vivo even if they are located deep in
mice. In addition, the advent of near infrared fluorescent proteins as powerful reporters for gene
expression studies enhanced the importance of the fluorescent whole-body imaging in small
animals. Our company currently offers the only gantry-based combined X-ray CT and Fluorescent
Tomography (FLT) system available in the market that can provide 3D whole-body fluorescent
images of mice along with anatomic X-ray images.
 Our main objective in this application is to upgrade our scanner using an intensified-CCD
(ICCD) camera that will mainly allow our system to provide Bioluminescence Tomography (BLT)
capability in addition to the FLT. Utilization of an ICCD camera will also enhance the FLT by
improving the sensitivity and image acquisition speed. Bioluminescence imaging enables
visualization of the genetically engineered luciferase gene-based reporter construct in living
animals. Application of bioluminescence imaging has grown tremendously in the past two
decades for many fields including immunology, oncology, virology and neuroscience due to its
unprecedented sensitivity and ease of use. Being gantry based, our upgraded system would be
able to acquire bioluminescence images from multiple views and reconstruct 3D BLT images,
which is not an option in any commercially available instruments at the moment. Capability of
acquiring perfectly co-registered X-ray CT, FLT, and BLT images will place this proposed system
and our company to the forefront of the optical molecular small animal imaging market."

This K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award will provide Dr. Kelsey Serier with training to develop
an independent research career devoted to understanding the effect of trauma and trauma-related negative
mental health sequalae, namely posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), on the development and course of type
2 diabetes (T2D). Dr. Serier has assembled an impressive interdisciplinary mentorship team comprised of
experts in trauma, behavioral science, epidemiology, endocrinology, and health informatics to support her
development and successful completion of the proposed training and research goals. Through a
comprehensive and carefully designed training plan, Dr. Serier will address previous training gaps and develop
skills in (1) domain-specific knowledge related to PTSD and T2D, (2) epidemiologic methods and longitudinal
data analysis, and (3) professional development and grant writing. A cross-cutting training goal is furthering her
skills in conducting interdisciplinary team science. The proposed research program leverages the largest
electronic health record cohort of individuals at risk of T2D (n = 6,082,018) in the United States. Data come
from the Veteran’s Health Administration and includes an extensive set of clinician-based diagnoses,
laboratory tests, and up to 15 years of follow-up data. Utilizing this cohort, the current study aims to address
several critical gaps in our current knowledge of PTSD and T2D, specifically: (1) a lack of prospective data that
include clinician-derived diagnostic information, (2) minimal consideration of psychiatric comorbidity, (3) limited
investigation of PTSD on outcomes in individuals with T2D, including glycemic control, and (4) an absence of
studies considering the impact of sex, race, and ethnicity. Aim One will estimate the effect of PTSD,
depression, and their comorbidity on the rate of T2D using cox proportional hazard models and interaction
contrasts. Aim Two will include individuals who developed T2D during the study period (n = 936,596). A series
of conditional logistic regression models and interaction contrasts will be used to estimate the odds of poor
glycemic control in PTSD, depression, and their comorbidity relative to non-psychiatric comparison groups.
Aim Three will examine the extent to which sex, race, and ethnicity modify the associations in Aims One and
Two. The current study includes a large number of women (n = 504,002) and individuals identifying as non-
Hispanic Black (n = 888,465), and Hispanic and Latino (n = 331, 817) to allow for analyses examining the
differential effect of PTSD on T2D in subpopulations with a higher burden of disease. The unique data source
and methodological rigor of the proposed study offers an efficient way to examine the associations between
PTSD and a range of T2D-related outcomes, which will ultimately inform targeted T2D prevention and
intervention approaches. Furthermore, the project will provide the applicant with essential interdisciplinary
training for an independent and integrative research program examining associations between the
psychological sequalae of trauma and T2D."
10783856,"Project Summary
Inflammatory bowel disorders and necrotizing enterocolitis represent insufficient epithelial repair,
stemming from failure of proper maintenance and expansion of resident intestinal stem cells (ISCs).
ISCs are housed in invaginations called crypts that expand during development and repair after
damage in a process called crypt fission. Little is understood of how crypt fission is mediated, however,
signaling factors including BMP inhibitors and non-canonical Wnts are implicated. ISCs are regulated
and maintained by similar signaling factors secreted by a surrounding mesenchymal environment called
“the niche”. It is unclear what role the niche plays in mediating crypt fission. The niche is composed of a
myriad of different cell types, including PDGFRA+ intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts (ISEMFs) and
smooth muscle, that are anatomically, molecularly, and functionally distinct. ISEMFs occur closest to
the epithelial-mesenchymal barrier, express both BMPs and non-canonical Wnts; smooth muscle
populations occur beneath crypts and express abundant BMP inhibitors. Preliminary data suggests that
signaling from both ISEMFs and smooth muscle is required for proper crypt fission. Smooth muscle
ablation reduces crypt fission during development; however, functional co-culture assays show limited
smooth muscle support of organoid growth in vitro. ISEMFs, on the other hand, promote different
organoid co-culture phenotypes depending on level of BMP inhibitor added: in low levels, ISEMFs
promote differentiation, and in high levels, promote increased crypt budding, aka fission. My hypothesis
is that crypt fission is a process coordinated by the signaling activities of both ISEMFs and smooth
muscle. In Aim 1, I will investigate the anatomical and functional profiles of ISEMFs and smooth
muscle in crypt fission. I will determine when these cells occur during instances of crypt fission,
including postnatal development and repair after damage, test the requirement of ISEMFs in promoting
crypt fission in vivo, and sufficiency of ISEMFs and smooth muscle in directing crypt fission in vitro. In
Aim 2, I will test whether ISEMFs direct crypt fission via non-canonical Wnt signaling. Using both
in vitro and in vivo methods, I will determine the specific function of ISEMFs in directing crypt fission via
non-canonical Wnt5a. Together, these studies will provide fundamental insights into the collective
regulation of crypt fission via distinct mesenchymal niche populations during development and epithelial
repair, aiding our understanding of fundamental intestinal biology and disease."
10786376,"Cardiopulmonary Toxicity of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems
Although electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) are widely used by youth and young adults, the toxicity
and the health effects of these products remain unclear. Many types of devices with varying constituents have
been introduced into the market, making it difficult to ascribe toxicity to a specific class of products or to study
their long-term health effects. ENDS produce volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as formaldehyde and
acrolein, which are generated by the thermal degradation of e-liquids containing propylene glycol:vegetable
glycerin (PG:VG) and may lead to adverse health effects. Nevertheless, the dependence of VOC generation on
e-liquid composition and constituents, nicotine and other ingredients has not been studied, and the contributions
of different constituents to the potential harmful effects of e-cigarettes remain unclear. Therefore, within the
framework of a regulatory context, we plan to study the cardiovascular and pulmonary toxicity of e-cigarette
aerosols over a wide range of operating conditions and use patterns to provide rigorous and comprehensive data
pertinent to the regulation of new and emerging devices by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Based
on our previous work, we propose that device-specific cardiovascular and pulmonary effects of e-cigarettes are
in large part mediated by the extent of VOCs generation and toxicity, which are modified by co-exposure to
nicotine and other e-liquid ingredients as well as individual use patterns."

Orientia tsutsugamushi (O.t.) is the etiological agent of scrub typhus, a devastating disease with a high mortality rate that
is transmitted by the bite of certain trombiculid mites or “chiggers”. Over one million individuals are infected annually,
however, these statistics may be a gross underestimate of disease incidence as the “tsutsugamushi triangle”, where most
cases are reported, encompasses large regions of jungle in rural subtropical environments with limited access to hospitals
and diagnostic facilities. Beyond the tsutsugamushi triangle, recent reports have confirmed cases of the disease in South
America, Africa, and the Middle East. There is no vaccine and antibiotic resistant strains have been reported. Without
treatment, disease associated morbidities including hepatitis, renal failure, myocarditis, encephalitis, multiple organ failure,
and death can occur. Despite its significant impact on global health, little is known of the molecular mechanisms the
bacterium uses to infect and cause disease in humans. Specifically, the bacterial factors that promote host cell subversion
and bacterial pathogenesis remain largely unknown. The key roadblock to a more detailed understanding of how O.t. causes
disease lies in the inability to genetically manipulate the pathogen. Overcoming the genetic intractability of O.t. will remove
the single largest barricade to extending our operational knowledge of the molecular mechanisms utilized by the bacterium
to hijack host cells. Here we propose to develop the first functional system for genetic transformation of O.t. which will
present a unique opportunity to overexpress epitope-tagged proteins in O.t. and generate the first site specific O.t. mutants.
During the R61 phase, we will develop a shuttle vector and transformation method for use in O.t. (Aim 1) and adapt the
TargeTron system to insertionally inactivate select TPR proteins (Aim 2). In the R33 phase, we will use these newly
developed tools and mutants to determine whether select TPR are secreted proteins that promote host cell invasion or
bacterial proliferation by perturbing the host cell cycle (Aim 3). Our proposed studies will generate the first tools and
reagents to genetically alter O.t., a resource that will be invaluable to other Orientia researchers."
10786899,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Social vocalizations and movement-generated sounds often provide pivotal knowledge about an animal’s
identity, location, or state, yet most studies of natural behavior fail to integrate acoustic information with
simultaneous recordings of high-dimensional neural activity and behavioral dynamics. This proposal will develop
novel experimental and computational methods to attribute vocal and non-vocal sounds to individuals in a
naturalistic, acoustically complex, multi-animal environment. By integrating this rich acoustic information with
simultaneous video and wireless neural recordings, we seek to predict auditory cortical responses to auditory
cues, as a function of social context and individual identity within the family. Aim 1 will develop new tools with
which to attribute vocal and non-vocal sounds to individual animals in a multi-animal setting (i.e., the “who said
what” problem). In Aim 1A, we will collect, curate, and publicly release a range of benchmark datasets containing
simultaneous camera and microphone array recordings of multi-animal interactions with ground truth labels of
sound sources. We will use these benchmarks to validate new models for sound localization. In Aim 1B, we will
develop and release deep learning models that localize sounds with calibrated confidence intervals, using
synchronized video measurements to enhance predictions. Aim 2 will use these tools to identify archetypal,
acoustically-driven social behaviors. We will establish a new experimental paradigm that permits months-long
monitoring of rodent social behavior in a large, naturalistic environment with simultaneous camera and
microphone array recordings. Using this data, we will develop novel data analytic approaches that leverage
synchronized audio and video data streams to identify social interaction sequences. A key goal is to assess
individual differences in social behavior across families. Aim 3 is a proof-of-concept experiment in which we
determine how acoustically-driven social behaviors (established in Aim 2) predict auditory cortex responses to
both vocal or movement-generated sounds. To accomplish this, we will make continuous wireless
electrophysiological recordings from the auditory cortex of adolescent and adult gerbils within their naturalistic
family environment. We will build regression models to infer our ability to predict neural responses from
auditory/behavioral covariates (encoding models)."

By the year 2050, the US population over age 65 will double and the population over age 85 will increase 5-fold.
A large and increasing number of older people with schizophrenia will need more effective services. Older adults
with schizophrenia are at risk for cognitive and functional decline leading to premature institutionalization. Over
the past two decades, we developed Cognitive Behavioral Social Skills Training (CBSST) and established its
efficacy for preventing functional decline in people with schizophrenia. In longitudinal studies, older participants
with schizophrenia receiving CBSST did not improve significantly in functioning but did remain stable over 1-2
years, whereas older participants in treatment as usual and supportive contact (SC) experienced decline in
functioning. CBSST is now recommended by SAMSHA as an evidence-based psychosocial intervention to
prevent functional decline in middle-age to older adults with schizophrenia. Our prior work focused primarily on
middle-aged adults, but our recent pilot data also showed that CBSST can prevent decline in functioning in adults
with schizophrenia aged 60 or above (mean age (SD) = 65.3 (5.3)). In this late-life schizophrenia clinical trial, we
also observed: (1) patients who showed larger improvement in CBSST Skills Learning showed significant
improvement, not just stability, in functioning at 1-year follow-up; and (2) CBSST Skills Learning was predicted
by baseline executive function. These findings suggest that CBSST Skills Learning is an important mechanism
of change in functioning in CBSST and that boosting executive function could boost CBSST Skills Learning,
which could improve rather than only stabilize functioning. Our group has also developed an Executive Function
Training program that improves executive function but has only modest impact on functioning in mid-life adults
with schizophrenia. Thus, given (1) the extensive evidence that CBSST maintains but does not improve
functioning in mid- and late-life adults with schizophrenia; (2) Executive Function Training improves executive
function but has limited effect on functioning; and (3) CBSST Skills Learning is associated with executive
function, we propose a two-site R61/R33 to test among adults with late-life schizophrenia whether combining
Executive Function Training with CBSST (E-CBSST) will result in better CBSST Skills Learning, and in turn,
improve rather than only maintain functioning. If successful, we will test E-CBSST in a larger confirmatory trial
and if successful E-CBSST would be the first psychosocial intervention to lead to such improvement in late-life
schizophrenia. There is no doubt that stronger effective treatments for functional disability in late-life individuals
living with schizophrenia would have a profound effect on patients, family members, society and the economy."
10791737,"Huntington’s disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by the
expansion of a CAG triplet repeat encoding a stretch of polyglutamine (polyQ) within Huntingtin (HTT), the
protein product of the HD gene. The HD mutation confers a deleterious gain-of-function, possibly via the
expression of both toxic RNA transcripts and protein, together with potential loss of normal HTT function that
affects a variety of cellular functions. A number of HTT lowering strategies are being developed–Phase III
clinical trials testing the efficacy of anti-sense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting either total HTT expression or
selectively mutant HTT (mHTT) expression are underway, while Htt lowering using other approaches (miRNA
and splicing modulators) are currently in safety/tolerability trials or will begin such trials shortly. Many of the
initial preclinical studies, however, did not examine the long-term effects of Htt lowering in aged models. Using
a regulatable HD mouse model whose mHtt expression or total Htt expression are controlled via a Lac
operator/repressor system, we found that global pre-symptomatic ~50% Htt lowering (starting prior to 3 months
of age) of either mutant or total Htt expression was more beneficial in ameliorating HD mouse model
phenotypes in comparison to later lowering (starting at 6 months of age or later), and that there were no
obvious detrimental consequences from lowering total Htt expression in comparison to the allele-specific
lowering of mHtt expression. However, we observed that in older mice, the beneficial effects of earlier Htt
lowering were attenuated for some, but not all HD model phenotypes. We hypothesize that: (1) brain regions
respond differentially to the amount and/or timing of mHtt lowering, and aging may exacerbate this effect, and
(2) >50% reduction of mHtt expression may be needed to maintain homeostatic cellular and physiological
functions whose efficiency declines with age. To test these hypotheses, and to provide a better understanding
of how lowering mHtt expression affects homeostatic functions in older mice, we propose three aims. In (Aim
1), we will characterize the effects of globally lowering mHtt expression by ~75% using a different strain of Lac-
regulatable HD mouse model to determine if the benefits of mHtt lowering can be extended beyond 12 months
of age for all HD mouse model phenotypes. To determine if the DNA damage response and
neuroimmflamation, two critical homeostatic functions that decline with age, can modulate the effect of mHtt
lowering in older mice, we propose to characterize the DNA damage response in (Aim 2), while in (Aim 3), we
propose to characterize activation of the inflammasome and measure meningeal lymphatic function in our
mHtt-lowered mice and controls. Together, these aims should provide new insight into the degree of mHtt
lowering that is needed to impact HD pathogenesis in aging mice. In addition, determining if two age-related
pathways correlate with mHtt expression levels and/or HD model phenotypes could provide new potential
therapeutic targets to be explored for the treatment of HD."

Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) is a medicinal plant that has been used in Southeast Asia for hundreds of years to
self-treat chronic-pain, opioid with-drawl, and depression. Due to these unique pharmacological effects, in the
past decade Kratom has flourished in the U.S. with many users self-treating opioid use disorder and pain
management. This medicinal herb has become a life-raft many use to pull themselves out of the pit of addiction,
rather than continuously falling in the trap of relapsing. Despite the recent attention, this plant remains
controversial in the eyes of the Food and Drug Administration and the Drug Enforcement Administration due to
limited or preliminary clinical research. Although, several studies have been conducted on Kratom’s primary
alkaloid mitragynine, characterizing it a partial antagonist of the μ-opioid receptor activated through the G-protein
signaling cascade. Kratom users report pain relieving properties and a depletion in negative side effects such as
constipation, addiction, and respiratory depression compared to morphine-based opioids. Furthermore, studies
show that some mitragynine analogs such as mitragynine pseudoindoxyl and 7-hydroxymitragynine are even
more potent agonists of the µ-opioid receptor, although a complete structure activity relationship of these
alkaloids has not been established. Thus, unanswered questions remain regarding where and how to manipulate
mitragynine to be the ultimate opioid substitution drug. Our goal is to fully elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of
mitragynine to determine the biocatalytic transformations required to produce the mitragynine scaffold.
Determining the biocatalytic pathway opens the door to manipulate critical catalysts that form mitragynine to
produce analogs that may enhance the pharmacological properties already displayed from this unique alkaloid.
Furthermore, we plan to derivatize mitragynine even further by characterizing and engineering flexible catalysts
from other organisms to produce mitragynine analogs with alternative cyclization, stereochemistry or functional
group patterns. Through this study we will generate a library of mitragynine analogs with the goal of identifying
effective candidates to help treat opioid use disorder. The overreaching hypothesis is that through methods of
protein engineering we can diversify the mitragynine scaffold beyond what is attainable through general synthetic
approaches and prepare novel compounds with enhanced pharmacological properties concerning opioid
response. Ultimately, mitragynine analogs have the potential to fast-track the development of new and safer
treatments for opioid use disorders therefore permanently improving the lives of those affected."

Regulation currently relies heavily on machine-generated emissions to predict harmful and potentially harmful
constituent (HPHC) exposure from using products under review, without a good understanding of how the
product will impact public health under real-world conditions. This study addresses the question of whether
ecig users who currently choose to use lower nicotine eliquids are actually consuming less nicotine compared
to those who choose to use higher nicotine eliquids. We will provide evidence on the extent to which using low
nicotine eliquids reduces one’s overall exposure to HPHC. We will monitor N=120 pod and pen-style regular
ecig users in their natural environment for one week, collecting ambulatory topography data using RIT’s
wPUMTM monitors along with daily salivary cotinine, subject effects and exposure and health effect biomarkers.
Data will be evaluated in the context of the joint effect of product characteristics and behavior on product
emissions and, ultimately, on public health. Aim 1: Evaluate HPHC exposure using the traditional approach of
salivary cotinine, a well-accepted biomarker for nicotine exposure, and other urinary and salivary biomarkers of
exposure and adverse health affect. Aim 2: Evaluate HPHC exposure using a novel alternative outcome
measure we call behavior-based yield, which incorporates one-week of intensive puff-by-puff topography and
product-specific emissions, Aim 3: Add pharmacokinetics to improve the predictive utility of the behavior-
based yield model by incorporating personalized reaction kinetics, which will then be applied to predict the
time-course of salivary cotinine for one-week of natural use. We expect the outcomes to support the
premise that exposure to both nicotine and total particulate matter are important in risk assessment,
and the potential to inadvertently increase one by decreasing the other must be considered when
making product choices and regulatory decisions. This project will; (1) Provide evidence that regulating
nicotine concentration alone does not reduce nicotine uptake, nor reduce adverse health effect; (2) Provide
device-independent evidence that users of lower nicotine eliquids do not consume less nicotine and may
consumer more total particulate matter compared to users of higher nicotine eliquids; (3) Provide evidence
supporting the need for rigorous accounting of behavior when reporting HPHC exposure in PMTA and MRTP
applications; and (4) Provide evidence in support of establishing a causal relationship between tobacco
product characteristics and health effect."
10786883,"Summary
The aim of this proposal is to develop an innovative new system, including hardware assemblies and machine
learning algorithms, for continuous, high-resolution 3D quantification of behavioral and eliciting stimulus
dynamics in a natural mouse prey capture paradigm. The system will satisfy a critical unmet need for an easily
adoptable, modern behavioral measurement technology that extends well beyond current offerings, which are
difficult to set up and limited largely to measuring spontaneous animal movement in impoverished, static
environments. Our system consists of a 3D convolutional neural network processing multi-perspective video
recordings to provide detailed measurements of both predator (mouse) and prey (cricket) spatiotemporal
movement patterns within an enclosed, compact apparatus permitting precise control over the visual
environment. To reduce implementation complexity and enhance usability in other labs, the system will use only
a single commercial video camera and a set of low-cost mirrors to provide the multiple perspectives required for
3D behavior tracking. By using only a single camera, we also reduce the instrument’s physical footprint, thus
facilitating high-throughput studies across multiple setups. Furthermore, our 3D tracking algorithm will be built to
support out-of-the-box generalization to cloned setups, meaning other labs can immediately start doing science
with the instrument without laborious data labeling and training steps. As part of our system, we will also develop
new methods for analyzing the rich 3D mouse and cricket data to isolate key kinematic and action variables
along with comprehensive characterization of stimulus-behavior relationships. We will then investigate how these
new measurements can be used to better understand retinitis pigmentosa and Parkinson’s disease. Preliminary
experiments have been quite successful and illustrate the promise and power of our approach to collect large
amounts of quantitative behavior data and identify new phenotypes of motor disorders. As our vision is to make
as large of an impact as possible, our system and datasets will be shared openly with community to catalyze a
wide range of new research into brain function and treatments for neurological disease."

Stroke is the second leading cause of mortality worldwide, and ischemic stroke represents 85% of strokes in the
United States. A key step in the management of stroke is the identification of its cause, which has profound
therapeutic and prognostic implications. For ischemic (embolic) stroke, identifying the source of the embolus
allows informed treatment decisions to be made to prevent recurrent stroke. Despite the importance of identifying
the etiology of stroke, some 30-40% of ischemic strokes are “cryptogenic,” where the source of the
thromboembolism is never identified. Underlying sources of cryptogenic stroke include undetected atrial
fibrillation/intracardiac thrombi, atheroma of the aortic arch, atherosclerosis of the carotid or vertebral arteries,
and paradoxical embolism of deep venous thrombosis across a patent foramen ovale. Currently identifying the
source of stroke involves multiple imaging studies including transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), magnetic
resonance imaging, computed tomography and duplex ultrasound, and is frequently negative. In addition, these
techniques rely of the presence of echogenic material or filling defects to detect thrombus, which provides no
biological information at all on the thrombus. To address these limitations we have developed the fibrin-binding
PET probe 64Cu-FBP8. In the previous cycles of this award, we invented this probe and validated it preclinically
in rodent models of arterial, venous, and embolic thrombosis. We next performed IND enabling preclinical safety
and manufacturing studies, and obtained an IND from FDA to translate 64Cu-FBP8 to clinical research. Imaging
in healthy volunteers established favorable dosimetry, rapid renal clearance, and low background signal in the
head, neck, thorax, and deep veins. In 24 patients with atrial fibrillation, 64Cu-FBP8 PET was 100% sensitive and
84% specific for the detection of left atrial appendage (LAA) thrombus, using TEE as the gold standard. Having
validated the accuracy of 64Cu-FBP8 for the detection of LAA thrombus in stable outpatients, we now seek to
expand the use of the probe to detect thrombus in acutely ill hospitalized patients and, specifically, patients with
acute stroke. The aim of this renewal is to use PET-CT of 64Cu-FBP8 to detect the source of embolus in ischemic
stroke and in particular cryptogenic stroke. Multi-station PET imaging of 64Cu-FBP8 will provide a whole-body
readout of thrombus burden and will allow important questions in stroke pathogenesis to be addressed. In
addition, the signature from 64Cu-FBP8 will provide an index of thrombus age, allowing the impact of this on
embolism to be determined. In aim 1 of the proposal we will validate the ability of PET-CT of 64Cu-FBP8 to detect
thrombus in hospitalized patients. In aim 2 we will use the agent in subjects with acute stroke of known origin,

10792619,"Tuberculosis (TB) is the most lethal infectious disease in human history, and prior to the COVID-19 pandemic
was the leading cause of death from a single infectious agent globally, exceeding HIV. The COVID-19
pandemic has disrupted global TB control and is predicted to result in further increases in TB morbidity and
mortality. Globally, the highest rates of drug-resistant TB have been reported from Eastern Europe, including
the country of Georgia and other former Soviet republics. To meet the ambitious WHO End TB Strategy goals
for 2035, new tools are urgently needed, including new and better drugs, improved diagnostics and an effective
vaccine, as well as better implementation of existing tools. A shortage of well-trained TB investigators in
Georgia and globally remains a key barrier to achieving the End TB Strategy goals. This renewal D43
application for the Emory-Georgia TB Research Training Program (EGTB-RTP) represents a collaboration
between Emory University in Atlanta, GA, USA, and the 2 public health institutions in Tbilisi, Georgia,
responsible for TB diagnostics, treatment, research and control: the National Center for Tuberculosis and Lung
Disease (NCTLD) [lead Georgian institution] and the National Center for Disease Control and Public Health
(NCDC) as well as collaboration with the Georgian AIDS Center and Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University
(TSU). Much progress has been achieved since the initial funding of the EGTB-RTP in developing TB research
infrastructure in Georgia, which was non-existent 16 years ago. Our program has provided long-term research
training to 31 Georgians over 16 years helping to establish an emerging critical mass of MD and PhD-level
investigators. Trainees in the EGTB-RTP have been highly productive with 92 TB-related publications during
the current 5-year cycle of funding. NCTLD TB-related research funding has increased from <$5,000 per year
when the EGTB-RTP was initiated to currently >$3 million per year. A major focus of an additional 5-year cycle
of funding is the full transition of the leadership, management, and coordination of the research training
program to Georgian investigators to ensure sustainability. To facilitate this transition, we propose an MPI
format: Henry M. Blumberg, MD at Emory (PI of the EGTB-RTP since its inception) and Nestani Tukvadze,
MD, a former Fogarty trainee who is now Director of the Clinical TB Research Unit at NCTLD and a leader of
TB research in Georgia. Specific Aims of this renewal application include: 1) Transition program leadership,
management, and training to Georgian investigators; 2) Continue to build human capacity to conduct high
quality internationally recognized TB-related research in Georgia, focusing on long-term didactic and mentored
research training to 12 new Fogarty trainees with outstanding potential; 3) Enhance research capacity and
sustainability by providing leadership, mentor, and team science training; and 4) Focus on TB translational
research and training in particular areas of strength along the T1-T4 translational research spectrum as well as
implementation science and the requisite training to translate research findings into public policy."

IDH-mutant gliomas are the most common gliomas of young adults. Despite initial sensitivity to chemotherapy
and radiation, they invariably progress as treatment resistant lesions to become ultimately fatal. The unique
metabolic phenotype of IDH-mutant glioma leaves malignant cells potentially vulnerable to several candidate
therapies or therapeutic combination. There remains an urgent unmet need for a reliable quantitative monitoring
biomarker to accelerate translational progress Since disease course frequently extends over several years,
patient-centric models of therapeutic discovery could leverage reliable surrogate outcomes toward iterative
refinement of individualized therapies. This project utilizes a phased, milestone-driven feasibility, discovery (R61;
Aims 1-2) and validation analysis (R33; Aims 3-4) of D2-HG as a candidate biomarker of IDH-mutant glioma.
This study takes advantage of neurosurgical access to the CNS, wherein CSF access devices utilized for clinical
management may be deployed for longitudinal CSF access as an adjunct to lumbar puncture. Moreover, it utilizes
tumor-based benchmarks for D2-HG content and production within the tumor based on analysis of tumor tissue
and microdialysate.
We hypothesize that CSF D2-HG represents a useful monitoring biomarker for IDH-
mutant glioma to help quantify response to therapy and identify disease recurrence. To test this
hypothesis, we propose the following aims:
Aim 1: Determine the technical and biological performance characteristics of CSF D2-HG as a biomarker
of IDH-mutant glioma. Detailed and rigorous analyses will be performed for D2-HG and its mass spectroscopy
assay including stability, precision, accuracy, interference, and technical as well as biological variance upon
repeated measurements and correlates to tumor properties based upon gold-standard benchmarks.
Aim 2: Determine a baseline threshold value of CSF D2-HG diagnostic for IDH-mutant glioma and define
the minimal percent change indicative of altered disease burden. Appropriate ROC models will be built with
and AUC analysis to define a threshold diagnostic of IDH-mutant glioma. Cross-sectional patient cohorts will be
used to evaluate responsiveness of D2HG to therapy and disease progression
Aim 3: Validate CSF D2HG as a biomarker of therapeutic response. CSF D2-HG will be evaluated
longitudinally in to validate responsiveness to therapy as benchmarked modified RANO criteria.
Aim 4: Evaluate CSF D2HG as a biomarker of disease progression. A cumulative cross-sectional cohort of
patients with verified IDH-mutant gliomas will be followed longitudinally during disease monitoring for recurrent
disease to validate the defined threshold indicative of disease progression."
10808447,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hospice programs have been historically less experienced in caring for beneficiaries with Alzheimer’s and
Related Dementia (ADRD), although ADRD represents one of the fastest growing primary diagnoses among
hospice beneficiaries. A majority of hospice beneficiaries in long-term-care (LTC) settings have ADRD,and it is
possible for certain hospice programs (i.e. those with higher volumes of beneficiaries with ADRDand/or in LTC
settings) to be better at caring for the challenging end-of-life care needs of ADRD beneficiaries. Such
specialization could be achieved through hospice programs’ greater clinical experience in dementia care
and/or collaboration with LTC staff. However, it requires more research to understand the quality implications
when a hospice program have a higher volume of LTC beneficiaries (i.e. an LTC hospice). This is because
LTC hospices may target LTC beneficiaries with financial incentives, given that LTC beneficiaries have overall
longer lengths of hospice stay, who are more profitable to the hospice program under the Medicare Hospice
Benefit payment structure. A lack of knowledge on this issue prevents the identification of best hospice care
practices for ADRD beneficiaries and an effective modification to the Medicare Hospice Benefit. Building on our
ongoing research and in response to PAS-19-391, our proposed study has two aims: 1) Describe individual-,
nursing home/assisted living-, hospice-, and neighborhood-level characteristics associated with receiving care
from LTC hospices, overall trend and by care settings (i.e. nursing home, assisted living, community); 2)
Compare the quality outcome between beneficiaries with ADRD who receive care from LTC hospices with a
those receiving care from non-LTC hospices, using difference-in-difference cross-temporal matching.
This study is innovative in that we include assisted living in defining LTC hospices, given that assisted living is
an increasingly common site of hospice care for beneficiaries with ADRD. We will examine whether/how quality
outcomes differ by hospice specialization and care settings, given that prior research shows care setting to be
an important determinant for hospice quality outcome. The application of difference-in-difference cross-
temporal matching addresses several important selection issues (i.e. personal preference for hospice by
specialization type, selections between nursing home/assisted living and hospice) in examining the quality
performance of LTC hospices. The use of national claims data will enhance our knowledge at the national level
about the quality of LTC hospices, because prior research relies mostly on survey data. By the end of this
project, we will determine whether beneficiaries with ADRD, who receive care from LTC hospices in different
care settings, experience better outcomes. The expected outcome of this project is to provide empirical
evidence on how hospice programs’ specialization impacts the quality of care among ADRD beneficiaries.
These contributions represent the first step of a larger research project that further examines the impact of
recent policy changes and market shifts on the quality of hospice care delivered to ADRD beneficiaries."
10808374,"Project Summary / Abstract
We do not fully understand how the cortex adapts its limited resources to optimally represent sensory information
in time-varying environments. The proposed studies aim to mathematically characterize adaptation in
populations of cortical neurons by applying novel geometric analyses and developing a normative theory that
accounts for the experimental data.
In Aim 1, we will test two hypothetical properties of adaptation. Direction invariance posits that the direction of
the population response to a given stimulus is approximately invariant to changes in its prior probability of being
observed. A power law relationship postulates that the ratio of the magnitudes of population response to a fixed
stimulus across two statistical environments is a power of the ratio between its prior probabilities. An empirical
confirmation of these findings will deliver the first mathematical characterization of adaptation capable of
predicting population responses in a new environment from the population responses in a known one.
In Aim 2, we will develop a normative theory for the power law property. We will consider the hypothesis that a
power law emerges as a tradeoff between discrimination performance and the metabolic cost of cortical
representation. We will tackle this question using two synergistic approaches: (a) the analysis of simple,
analytically tractable models of adaptation and (b) a larger class of auto-encoder models, which provide a flexible
way to study the problem numerically.
The proposed studies are significant because they fill a major gap in the field by taking a rigorous look at cortical
adaptation at the population level, gathering critical data not yet available to the community, and analyzing them
using innovative geometric analyses and theoretical modeling. These rigorous studies rely on solid concepts
from representational geometry and efficient coding. Solid, preliminary findings show the work has a good
chance of transforming our conceptual view of adaptation at the level of neural populations, generating ideas
readily applicable to other sensory modalities and systems."

How does neuronal signaling control behavior? Neuroscientists answer this question by mapping neuronal
circuits, studying action potential firing, or monitoring the resultant neurochemicals released. Drosophila is a
model system used to map neural circuits and study cell firing during innate behaviors, such as feeding. Direct
measurements of neuromodulators are required to understand behavioral regulation because release is highly
heterogeneous and plastic; i.e. the same firing patterns elicit different neuromodulator release in different
circumstances due to complex regulation. To understand how neuromodulation regulates behavior or encodes
memories, we need tools to examine multiple neuromodulators throughout a circuit. The goal of this project is
to develop new multiplexed tools to study neuromodulator interactions in Drosophila during sugar feeding. The
central hypothesis is that dopamine, octopamine, and glutamate neuromodulation will occur only in discrete
neuropil, vary with frequency of sugar feeding, and be enhanced when sugar is paired with odors. This research
is significant because it will develop tools to map real-time signaling of multiple neuromodulators throughout a
circuit and use these tools to show how neuromodulator interactions in a circuit control appetitive memory
formation during sugar feeding. In Aim 1, we will develop new nanoelectrodes to co-detect octopamine and
dopamine using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) and measure them in the mushroom body (MB) g5
compartment during sugar feeding. Octopamine modulation of dopamine will be tested by selectively activating
or suppressing a specific octopaminergic neuron. In Aim 2, the goal is to understand dopamine neuromodulation
during sugar feeding across compartments of the MB. A genetically-encoded dopamine sensor (GRABDA) will be
selectively expressed in either MB dopamine neurons or the protocerebral anterior medial (PAM) projection
neurons and dopamine recorded during sugar feeding and olfactory conditioning. In Aim 3, neuromodulation will
be mapped throughout a circuit that regulates sugar reward by measuring dopamine and octopamine in the g5
compartment of the mushroom body and glutamate signaling (iGluSnFR) from a mushroom body output neuron
in the superior medial protocerebrum. These experiments will be the first to multiplex FSCV and genetically
encoded sensors to understand how dopamine/octopamine regulation in the mushroom body controls output
signaling downstream in a circuit. The expected outcomes of this work are mapping of neuromodulator
interactions throughout a circuit in adult Drosophila during feeding and olfactory conditioning. The positive impact
will be advanced methods and foundational knowledge necessary to perform future studies of how genetics,
behavior, or disease alter neuromodulator release. The neuromodulators studied here are implicated in mental
health disorders, such as schizophrenia, compulsive eating, or addiction, and this work facilitates using
Drosophila as a model organism for studying neuromodulation in neurological diseases."

With advances in treatment and care,a longer life expectancy is changing the demographics of the HIV
epidemic, and nearly half of those living with HIV in the U.S. are now 50 years or older. People living with HIV,
even while receiving effective HIV medications, have excess morbidity and mortality compared to HIV-
uninfected populations. Increasing age, comorbid burden, and lifestyle factors, contribute to greater than
expected impairments in key components of daily function and a high burden of fatigue among older adults
living with HIV. Effective, scalable, non-pharmacological strategies are needed to improve the healthspan of
this vulnerable population.
 The overall goals of this proposal are to determine whether high-intensity interval training (HIIT) can
overcome 1) physical function impairments and increased fatigue and 2) impairments in mitochondrial
bioenergetics of older people with HIV (PWH) to a greater extent than continuous moderate-intensity exercise
(CME). We further seek to determine whether a biobehavioral coaching intervention following either HIIT or
CME can promote long-term adherence to physical activity, a crucial component of the sustainability of the
intervention. We have previously demonstrated greater than expected impairments in physical function and a
high prevalence of fatigue among older adults with HIV. We found that CME and resistance exercise improves
physical function in older PWH, with additional improvements from a higher-intensity aerobic and
resistance exercise program. Additionally, only our higher-intensity continuous aerobic exercise intervention
reduced fatigue among PWH. Lastly, less than half of our participants continued to exercise at least once
a week following the supervised intervention, which suggests that even when exercise is beneficial it can be
difficult for PWH to maintain. Together, our findings suggest that an innovative approach to exercise is
needed to improve physical function, reduce fatigue, and to maintain a long-term exercise habit among
older PWH.
 To address this critical need, our proposed study will leverage the resources of two diverse participant
populations at the University of Colorado and Case Western Reserve University to 1) Compare HIIT vs CME
on physical function and fatigue, 2) Compare HIIT vs CME on skeletal muscle and peripheral blood
mononuclear cell mitochondrial bioenergetics, and 3) Test a coaching intervention vs control on physical
activity adherence, assessing perceptions of these approaches using mixed methods. This study will generate
rigorous data on physical function and fatigue responses to exercise, the associated mitochondrial adaptations,
and investigate strategies to instill sustained, self-directed exercise behavior. Overall, our findings will inform
the development of scalable, effective exercise recommendations tailored to the unique needs of aging PWH."

This research aims to improve cardiovascular outcomes and quality of life for atrial fibrillation (AF) patients by
allowing them to antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) safely at home. AF is the most common heart rhythm disorder,
affecting more than 38 million worldwide and causing significant morbidity and mortality. AADs reduce mortality
unlike other AF medications, but access to many is restricted by a three-day hospitalization required to start
these oral medications. This is due to a rare (<0.6%) heart rhythm side effect that may require defibrillation and
can be avoided by heart rhythm analysis. During a “drug load” hospitalization, corrected QT (QTc) intervals
from patient electrocardiograms (ECGs) are manually measured and tracked, as changes in the QTc interval
predicts adverse responses to AADs. For AF patients at low risk of proarrhythmia, the cost and risks of
hospitalization may outweigh the benefits. Importantly, for minority and rural populations where access to
elective hospitalization is limited, there is underutilization of guideline-based AF therapy and higher mortality.
The goal of this proposal is to develop a SafeBeat Kit that combines commercially available products (mobile
ECG device, mobile cardiac telemetry, and wearable defibrillator), with proprietary software that allows patients
to start AADs safely at home. In Phase-I equivalent studies, SafeBeat Rx developed the first machine learning
(ML) algorithm to automate QTc measurements from 12-lead and mobile 6-lead ECGs. The high QTc accuracy
(5±7 ms) enabled the algorithm to recommend AAD dosing with 90% accuracy compared to physicians. These
successful results have proven feasibility for the algorithm to support outpatient drug loading and ultimately
replace the three-day hospitalization. Results have also enabled us to submit an FDA 510(k) application for
approval of the QTc algorithm, which is currently underway. Our Phase II proposal is a human study validating
the SafeBeat Rx algorithm on the intended use population: AF patients starting AADs. During inpatient “drug
load” admissions, we will provide patients with commercially available devices approved for home use and
compare SafeBeat software QTc measurements and AAD dosing recommendations to real-time decisions
made by the expert medical team. This technology will improve our ability to deliver standard of care AF
treatment at home safely via remote patient monitoring. Informed by the National Institute on Minority Health
and Health Disparities (NIMHD) Research Framework, this technology will be designed to address disparities
in AAD hospitalizations that disproportionately affect rural communities and minority patients. Once SafeBeat
Rx technology is validated on the target population (Phase II), future studies will compare hospital care with
home-based care guided by SafeBeat Rx. This proposal is supported by the manufacturer of the only FDA-
approved wearable cardioverter defibrillator (LifeVest, Zoll) and by insurers due to significant cost savings."

Living with diabetes can be challenging, however Diabetes Self-Management Education and Support (DSMES)
is well known to help persons with diabetes (PWDM) learn to cope with the uncertainties of life with diabetes.
Unfortunately, DSMES is underutilized in the current health care setting. This is a multifactorial problem with
the two largest issues being providers not referring patients and patients not attending the DSMES programs.
These programs and the health care workers who support them have the potential to modify the disease
course for many PWDM, including potentially modifying long term morbidity and mortality. We are proposing a
feasibility study to test the impact of best practice advisories (BPAs) delivered to the health care provider and
the diabetes care and education specialists via the electronic health record when a PWDM is identified as
qualifying for DSMES. We will determine if the BPAs influence the time to referral for DSMES as well as the
factors that predict whether a patient is referred to DSMES. We also propose to assess the impact of a peer
support on motivating PWDM to attend DSMES and make healthier lifestyle choices. We hypothesize that if
PWDM are able to connect with a peer who is also living with diabetes, they may be more likely to attend
DSMES. Finally, we will assess qualitatively how the health care providers felt about the use of the BPA
reminders, explore how the PWDM felt about the utility of the peer supporters, and the overall relevance of the
diabetes education they received. From these lessons learned we will work with our stakeholders to design a
large, pragmatic randomized trial designed to increase the uptake of DSMES, a vital piece of the diabetes
puzzle."

Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited retinal disease afflicting 1 in 4,000 people worldwide. The disease
progresses initially by rod photoreceptor degeneration caused by mutations in rod-specific genes, although
different mutations in different genes converge upon the same rod degeneration phenotype in this disease.
However, it is the subsequent cone photoreceptor degeneration that causes loss in daylight color vision and
ultimately, diminishing quality of life for most patients. While gene therapy to replace a mutated gene with a
functional copy has been successful, given the heterogeneity in mutations and genes, it is difficult to treat all RP
cases by targeting the rods. Instead, a generic therapy to preserve the cones upon rod degeneration may lead
to a more comprehensive therapeutic option. Despite progress, the molecular mechanism for this secondary
cone degeneration remains unclear. In mouse models of RP, the cones in the central retina degenerate after rod
death, but interestingly, the cones in the peripheral retina survive long-term. The goal of this proposed research
is to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying peripheral cone survival in mouse models of
RP. During the mentored phase of this grant (K99 phase), factors that may be sufficient (Aim 1) and/or necessary
(Aim 2) for cone survival will be elucidated by cell type specific RNA sequencing, in vivo retinal electroporation,
and temporally-regulated gene deletion. During the independent phase of this grant (R00 phase), the causal
relationship between blood-retina-barrier breakdown and cone degeneration will be explored (Aim 3). Completion
of the proposed aims will lead to identification of key regulators of cone survival in mouse models of RP.
Moreover, we may identify, for the first time, a causal relationship between BRB breakdown and secondary cone
death, opening new cellular targets to prevent cone loss in patients with RP. Long-term, the approaches outlined
in this grant can become the cornerstone for answering questions regarding how, in general, neurons and other
supporting cells degenerate in neurodegenerative disorders across the central nervous system. The mentored
phase of this grant is conducted under the guidance of Dr. Constance Cepko, whose lab has developed many
techniques over the years to genetically manipulate the retina in vivo and discovered gene regulatory networks
underlying retinal cell type specification. The scientific environment that surrounds the Cepko Lab at Harvard
Medical School offers valuable opportunities for career development, helping to build a strong foundation for an
independent career investigating the molecular mechanisms of retinal degeneration."
10816682,"ABSTRACT: Urine and stool output tracking is essential for hospital treatment of diseases related to the heart,
lungs, and blood. For patients who can walk, output monitoring currently involves patients using plastic waste
collection hats. The manual nature of patient and nurse handling of collection hats leads to substantial error in
patient fluid balances and delays in reporting urine output data to providers. Challenges with urine output tracking
are acute when managing cardiovascular or pulmonary complications in which accurate monitoring of patient
waste is needed to manage volume overload and fine-tune diuretic dosing. Manual urine tracking also exposes
staff to hazardous chemicals and pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2. Our goal here is to develop a platform that
will allow the accurate collection urine output data in the setting of clinical management of heart failure patients.
Using a toilet-based sensor platform, we will automate the measurement of patient urination so that we are able
to mitigate the measurement inaccuracy and treatment delays that are currently caused by manual waste
monitoring. Our current device builds on multiple generations of prototype design that have involved extensive
simulations and hundreds of tests by human volunteers. Preliminary results from these tests suggest our current
prototype can detect urination with high sensitivity and measure urine mass with low error. To complete
development of a device suitable for cardiology patient use in hospitals, we will first validate the accuracy and
timeliness of our device in heart failure patients. We will measure the accuracy with which the device measures
urine volume, comparing device estimates of waste output to gold-standard data obtained from conventional
urine collection vessels. Second, we will quantify the decrease in lag time from urination to urine output data
reporting to physicians. Third, we will evaluate the feasibility of technology adoption. We will survey patients and
nurses to assess the potential increases in nurse and patient satisfaction associated with device usage. Since
we expect our automated device to reduce nurse workload, we will also track impacts on nursing effort on waste
tracking. In completing this Aim, we expect to develop the first automated platform for tracking urine output
among cardiology patients. More broadly, by developing our device in a challenging clinical unit involving frail
patients who can excrete large fluid volumes, we set the stage for transforming patient care in other hospital
settings relevant to NHBLI such as management of bone marrow transplant patients."

 The advent of remote technologies such as video conferencing and secure web-portals have revolutionized
approaches to health data collection and access to healthcare. For example, these technologies can be
deployed in fully remote and hybrid approaches for clinical trials which could help promoting more participation
among under-represented groups as well as by bridging geographic distance and reducing participant burden
(e.g., less travel time, more flexibility and confidentiality). Remote or online approaches can also increase
access to critical services (e.g., mental health counseling, sexually transmitted testing [STI] prevention) that
are scarce or geographically dispersed. However, these approaches have yet to be optimized for all possible
beneficiaries of technological advances in clinical trials and healthcare, especially targeting under-represented
populations that are disproportionately experiencing social and geographic isolation.
 Groups like Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI – including Native Hawaiian), American Indian (AI)
and Hispanic/Latino populations are often under-represented in clinical trials, so much so that they often
occupy the racial/ethnic category of “other” in research studies. Notably, their under-representation not only
leads to this literal “othering,” but also prevents scientists from identifying their unique concerns which in turn
diminishing the relevance and effectiveness of technologies and distribution campaigns among them.
 Sexual and gender minorities (SGM) such as gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender populations are also
often not strategically sampled for clinical trials, and SGM identities are often not even measured in clinical
trials. But many health concerns addressed in clinical trials are over-represented in SGM populations
compared to general populations (e.g., HIV, STIs, mental health concerns), thus, making many novel health
technologies (vaccines, antibiotics, hormonal therapies) disproportionately relevant to these populations. SGM
populations may experience social isolation at increased rates relative to the general population, which can be
further exacerbated by medical mistrust and stigmatizing experiences in healthcare and research contexts.
 To address these concerns, the current proposal seeks to leverage the team’s existing community
connections in states across 4 different regions of the U.S. among the aforementioned groups to: (1) (a) co-
create and maintain 4 virtual and hybrid advisory groups to address health issues and (b) develop materials for
the conduct of remote advisory groups; (2) co-develop and administer a national needs assessment survey for
the referenced 4 groups (N = 800) addressing the use of home self-testing technology (up to 3 types) and
remote data collection for healthcare research and healthcare provision; and (3) pilot a community driven
approach to introducing home self-testing technology and remote data collection to potential participants from
these groups to assess feasibility and acceptability."

We seek NINDS R25 funding for the Blazer BRAIN (Broadening Representation And Inclusion in Neuroscience)
Program at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). Although the number of U.S. citizens from
underrepresented minority (URM) groups earning doctoral degrees in science has increased over the past
decade, URMs continue to represent a small proportion of the scientists in the United States. Our UAB Blazer
BRAIN Program is a summer research experience that targets the obstacles impeding success with the goal of
increasing the number of trainees from diverse backgrounds in neuroscience research. We will recruit talented
undergraduates from our five partner HBCU institutions in AL, and nationally with a focus on the southeast
region. We aim to expose Blazer BRAIN undergraduate Scholars to research on the healthy nervous system
and neurological disease at UAB in laboratories of our federally funded faculty mentors. With continued
investment in Neuroscience at UAB by the School of Medicine and the Comprehensive Neuroscience Center,
the future of the Blazer BRAIN program is secure, and Scholars will benefit from the vibrant neuroscience
environment at UAB that currently exceeds $60M in NIH funding, with approximately $24M of that from NINDS.
The Blazer BRAIN Program will include career advising by the Program directors and research faculty mentors.
In addition, the Blazer BRAIN Program will partner with the NIH R25-funded UAB Roadmap Scholars (RMS)
Program, which also aims to promote diversity in neuroscience research but at the graduate level, by matching
Blazer BRAIN Scholars with RMS Aspirational Mentors (RAMs), to allow our Scholars to “see themselves” as
scientists in biomedical research careers. Blazer BRAIN Scholars will also be invited to attend the RMS NEURAL
conference, held every summer at UAB. Other value-added components of the Blazer BRAIN Program include
learning from their mentors about careers and work life balance as a neuroscientist at a major biomedical
research university; improvement of scientific communication skills; opportunities to present research at a
regional (UAB Summer Research EXPO) and national (ABRCMS, SACNAS or SfN) meeting; and assistance in
preparing applications for graduate school. Our primary goal for the initial funding period is to demonstrate
minimum 60% acceptance rate of Blazer BRAIN Scholars to PhD Programs. A rigorous evaluation plan is place
with metrics designed to achieve this success, with input to be received from Blazer BRAIN Scholars, mentors,
and internal and external advisory committees. If successful, the UAB Blazer BRAIN Program will increase
diversity in neuroscience research, and in turn promote the development of a richly diverse workforce in the
biomedical sciences."

Embryonic development requires the dynamic remodeling of epithelial sheets as the embryo
transforms itself during morphogenesis. Understanding these events has important implications
for understanding common human birth defects and common cancers. Our aim is a
multidisciplinary, integrated analysis of morphogenetic movements in embryos that unites
detailed structural analysis, single-molecule biophysics, genetics, and dynamic in vivo analysis,
using the C. elegans embryo as a model system. Our recent focus has been in two broad areas
of cytoskeletal regulation: the mechanisms by which mechanotransduction occurs through the
cadherin/catenin complex during morphogenesis, and cellular mechanisms of epithelial cell
rearrangement driven by basolateral motility. We will continue these emphases here:
1. Define mechanisms of α-catenin mechanotransduction during morphogenesis: We
 will examine the tension-dependent interaction of SRGP-1/srGAP with HMP-1/α-catenin and
 how SRGP-1 recruitment positively modulates cadherin complex function.
2. Define mechanisms of self-healing of junctional actin networks under tension during
 morphogenesis: We will test a model in which different LIM-domain containing repeat
 (LCR) proteins stabilize different substructures with the junctional proximal F-actin network
 under tension to prevent self-injury.
3. Define mechanisms of local actin polymerization in during epithelial cell
 rearrangement: We will use an integrated approach to determine how CRML-1/CARMIL
 negatively regulates motility via effects on the barbed end actin capping machinery.
4. Define local signaling pathways that promote polarized motility during cell
 rearrangement: We will determine how additional signaling components regulate epithelial
 cell rearrangement.
As a result of these studies, we will gain new insight into how adherens junctions are able to
withstand and respond to tension in a living organism, and we will elucidate a novel pathway
regulating cell intercalation via basolateral protrusive activity. Each project has widespread
implications for understanding processes crucial for diverse cellular events during human
development and disease."

Because of the staggering complexity of biological systems, biomedical research is becoming increasingly
dependent on knowledge stored in a computable form. The Gene Ontology (GO) is by far the largest
knowledgebase of how genes function, and has become a critical component of the computational
infrastructure enabling the genomic revolution. The GO knowledgebase encodes a computational model of
biological systems using modern semantic technologies, and this is the key to its broad adoption and
application. It stores vastly more knowledge than one person can know, and therefore enables computational
analyses that would otherwise be impossible. It has become indispensable in the interpretation of large-scale
molecular measurements in biological research. Crucially for human health research, GO is also one of a suite
of complementary ontologies constructed in such a way to maximally promote interoperability and
comparability of data sets. It represents the gene functions and biological processes that can be perturbed in
human disease, helping researchers or clinicians to identify genetic contributions to disease.
GO is a knowledgebase that can be statistically mined, either standalone or in combination with data from
other knowledge resources, which enables researchers to discover connections and form new hypotheses
from the biological networks GO represents. All knowledge in GO is represented using semantic web
technologies and so is amenable to computational integration and consistency checking.
To ensure the knowledge environment meets the requirements of biomedical researchers, we will: 1) Develop
and refine the Gene Ontology to reflect current biological knowledge; 2) Coordinate, integrate, and provide GO
assertions from multiple sources; 3) Enhance usability of the GO resources for multiple research communities.
We will extend the reach of our Consortium of contributors, to efficiently expand the content of the
knowledgebase, and develop test sets and challenges to spur the development of machine learning methods
for knowledge capture. Our aims reflect the essential requirements for realizing the overarching objectives for a
biomedical knowledgebase: efficiently capturing and integrating biological knowledge and adhering to the
highest possible standard for accuracy and detail; constructing and providing a robust, flexible, powerful, and
extensible technological infrastructure available not only for internal use but just as easily by the wider
community; and lastly, leveraging state-of-the-art social media, web services and other technologies to
disseminate the GO resource to the entire biomedical research community."
10824396,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are part of a fatal and untreatable
disease spectrum that is unified by a diverse presentation of TDP-43 aggregation across central nervous system
(CNS) tissue. Up to 50% of patients with motor dysfunction also present with cognitive deficits and 15% have
frank FTD, but the molecular mechanisms underlying diverse clinical and pathological presentations remain
poorly understood. In our recent work, we have shown that the Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioural ALS Screen
(ECAS) is a good clinical predictor of extra-motor TDP-43 pathology. Specifically, ECAS subdomain scores
correlate with the distribution of TDP-43 inclusions in brain regions corresponding to the affected cognitive
domains. However, the presence of TDP-43 pathology in a region is not predictive of cognitive deficits associated
with that region. We posit that there may be other, more sensitive, neuropathological correlates of cognitive
involvement that remain to be identified, and hypothesize that additional pathological features--including
nucleocytoplasmic protein mislocalization, perturbations in gene expression, and dysfunctional cell-cell
interactions--may correlate more closely with domain-specific cognitive impairment corresponding to a particular
region of the frontal cortex. We will test this hypothesis through a comprehensive multi-omic analysis of post-
mortem tissue that identifies 1) how differences in cell type-specific subpopulations and intercellular interactions
between ALS-FTD cases and controls relate to protein aggregation and mislocalization and 2) how these
differences relate to cognitive impairment in ALS-FTD. We will accomplish these goals using spatially resolved
proteomic (Aim 1) and transcriptomic (Aim 2) measurements to analyze clinico-pathologically stratified
dorsolateral prefrontal cortical tissue samples (specifically, Brodmann areas BA44 and BA46) from cognitively
impaired ALS patients and age/gender matched controls. By using a combination of approaches to
simultaneously map the spatial transcriptome and proteome of all interacting cellular subpopulations in these
regions, our aim is to elucidate the origins and temporal dynamics of inter- and intra-cellular activities that may
reveal novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets. We have previously implemented Spatial Transcriptomics (ST)
on the spinal cord to identify regional differences within subpopulations of various cell types that vary as a
function of disease dynamics. These data will be directly tied to measures of pathology (e.g., pathognomonic
inclusions). To integrate and analyze relationships between data across modalities, we will develop a
computational framework for harmonized analysis of multi-modal, multi-omic measures of disease burden (Aim
2). Finally, we will implement highly multiplexed immuno-imaging to validate our findings in an independent ALS-
FTD cohort (Aim 3). Our integrated analysis across experimental modalities (single cell RNA-seq, spatial
transcriptomics, multiplexed imaging and proteomics) will yield an unprecedented view of disease pathology and
elucidate neurotrophic and neurotoxic functions that are coordinated within and across different cell populations."

Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of premature death in persons with epilepsy
who do not have satisfactory seizure control. SUDEP results in more years of potential life lost than any other
neurological condition with the exception of stroke. There are no known ways of reliably preventing SUDEP.
Convergent lines of evidence suggest that respiratory dysfunction is a critical component of SUDEP
pathophysiology. There are several potential mechanistic explanations for the respiratory arrest seen in SUDEP.
(1) Serotonin signaling is important for stable breathing and increasing serotonergic tone may be protective
against seizure-induced respiratory arrest. Unfortunately, seizures disrupt serotonergic neurotransmission.
There is a gap in knowledge as to the mechanism responsible for seizure-induced disruption of serotonergic
neurotransmission. (2) Seizures also cause a surge in extracellular adenosine throughout the brain. Increases
in adenosine levels suppress breathing and inhibit neural activity. Excessive adenosine signaling has been
implicated in the respiratory dysfunction seen in SUDEP; however, the mechanism by which adenosine affects
breathing after seizures is unknown. (3) Slow moving (2-5 mm/min) waves of spreading depolarization are
sometimes triggered by seizures. Spreading depolarization transiently inactivates the brain tissue. Under certain
circumstances spreading depolarization can travel into the brainstem where it halts neural activity in nuclei
necessary for cardiorespiratory function and causes death. Brainstem spreading depolarization is a potential
cause of SUDEP. Spreading depolarization also causes an increase in extracellular adenosine. It is not known
whether the increase in adenosine due to spreading depolarization contributes to seizure-induced death. The
goal of this proposal is to integrate the serotonergic, adenosinergic, and spreading depolarization explanations
of SUDEP etiology by testing the central hypothesis that adenosine surging as the result of seizure activity and
spreading depolarization disrupts serotonergic neurotransmission thereby potentiating respiratory failure. In the
first aim, adenosine signaling will be augmented in the serotonergic raphe nuclei during seizures to determine if
this alters respiratory responsiveness to CO2 and the likelihood of respiratory failure. In the second aim,
brainstem spreading depolarization will be induced in mice in which adenosine signaling has been
pharmacologically or genetically altered in the raphe nuclei. The proposed experiments will generate compelling
evidence for or against the hypothesized interaction between serotonin and adenosine while providing the
training in writing, mentorship, and quantitatively rigorous hypothesis-testing necessary for a career in science."
10824276,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Maintaining stable gene transcription patterns is critical for cellular programming. Likewise, orderly switching
from one transcription pattern to another, termed reprogramming, is necessary for development, as well as for
numerous other biological processes. Dysregulated reprogramming can have catastrophic consequences, with
outcomes ranging from developmental disease to cancer. Notably, epigenetic abnormalities, failure to
differentiate, and inappropriate cellular programming are intricately linked to carcinogenesis. Our objective is to
define the function of H2A.Z (a variant form of histone H2A) in regulating cellular programming in vivo. We will
utilize the zebrafish model for early embryonic development, combined with a series of next-generation genome-
wide sequencing approaches, to functionally test how H2A.Z patterns regulate several aspects of cellular
reprogramming, including transcriptional activation. Regulation of gene transcription occurs through two primary
components: enhancers, the major cis-regulatory DNA sequence component, and transcription factors, the major
trans-regulatory DNA-binding protein component. However, due to technical challenges associated with in vivo
studies, several critical unknowns limit our understanding of how these elements function. For example, what
regulates activation of cell-type-specific enhancers among the many thousands of enhancers in the genome?
Likewise, among millions of small DNA-binding motifs, how are transcription factors able to selectively bind at a
discrete subset of locations? One interesting possibility is that interplay between transcription factors,
polymerase machinery, and epigenetic marks, regulates the binding of transcription factors, and the activity of
enhancers. We recently defined the function of specialized ‘Placeholder’ nucleosomes in developmental
reprogramming of gametes to stems cells in zebrafish. Placeholder nucleosomes enable proper genome-wide
pattering of epigenetic marks and facilitate activation of the zygotic genome. We determined that the major
functional unit of Placeholder nucleosomes, the histone variant H2A.Z, becomes localized to enhancer regions
during the subsequent stages of zebrafish development, when differentiation and cell-type specification occurs.
This led us to hypothesize that reorganization of H2A.Z patterns is a major factor in controlling developmental
cell-type specification. To test this hypothesis, we will genetically manipulate the regulators of H2A.Z localization
in zebrafish embryos, and then assess genome-wide impacts on enhancer activity, and cell-type-specific
transcription factor binding. Successful completion of this project will define the role of H2A.Z in controlling gene
expression patterns and in cellular programming. We propose that this broader concept, where changes in
epigenetic marks underlie cellular reprogramming, might be a general principle in biology, with relevance to
developmental biology, stem cell function, and carcinogenesis."

Technology use among young children in the U.S. has become increasingly prevalent over the past decade,
and the transition to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic has renewed concerns among parents and
educators about screen time. Recommendations for choosing high-quality apps and setting boundaries around
device use are often conveyed through position statements, white papers, and blog posts, but the information
is rarely presented in an engaging, family-friendly manner that can be readily adopted and sustained in young
children’s everyday routines. As a matter of health equity, this challenge is felt even more acutely among
language-minority households, who additionally face language barriers when attempting to access relevant
resources.
This project delivers an interactive, bilingual, hybrid virtual-and-physical world approach to address these
translational gaps. It presents recommendations from the academic and medical spheres through bilingual
storytelling and a suite of interactive, co-play activities in an online virtual world, then transitions the gameplay
to caretaker-child interactions in the physical world, empowering users to first practice healthy technology
through interactive online games and then implement those rehearsed practices in their day-to-day lives. The
effectiveness of the online platform and interactive content will be evaluated through a randomized controlled
study. Improvements in knowledge, attitudes, and confidence related to healthy technology use will be
assessed among children and their caretakers. The platform will also be evaluated for its ability to facilitate
bilingual interactions between child and caretaker that support learning and language development. Overall,
our product will serve not only as a means to inform families of best technology use practices, but as a catalyst
to broaden and reimagine joint play with digital devices especially among linguistic minority families."

Influenza is the cause of considerable morbidity and mortality globally. Despite immunization being the most
effective and economical prophylactic approach, vaccines often provide less than optimal defense against an
influenza virus infection and illness. While hemagglutinin (HA) is the primary target of influenza vaccines, it is
also known that the other major surface protein, neuraminidases (NA) induces protective antibodies. This Direct
to Phase 2 SBIR proposal continues our development and characterization of a unique vaccine platform that has
been formulated by POP BIO. This platform consists of fabricating lipid bilayer nanoliposomes with a cobalt-
porphyrin moiety intercalated into the bilayer (CoPoP) along with a monophosphoryl lipid A, a TLR4-based
vaccine adjuvant, and a saponin QS-21. CoPoP enables spontaneous nanoliposome adjuvant particle formation
(SNAP). When SNAP liposomes are combined with his-tagged recombinant trimeric HAs and tetrameric NAs, a
mosaic nanoparticle vaccine candidate, SNAP-Flu is formed. The his-tag stably inserts into the bilayer by
association with the cobalt producing nanoliposomes decorated with the immunogenic influenza antigens. In
preliminary data, we have established that HA and NA protect mice from lethal H1N1, H3N2 and B strain inflenza
virus challenge, while even better protection is observed with the multivalent SNAP-Flu nanoparticle vaccine. It
has also been shown that this platform allows for the use of much less antigen in the vaccine (antigen sparing)
in addition to the capacity for multiplexing with numerous antigens from different influenza strains. This study will
involve POP BIO producing and characterizing the physical and chemical properties of SNAP-Flu. POP BIO will
interact with the University at Buffalo, BIOQUAL, and Texas Biomedical Research Institute to assess the level
of protection of SNAP-Flu against challenge with mouse-adapted strains of influenza in mice, human influenza
strains in ferrets, and human influenza strains in non-human primates. The amount of antigen-sparing will be
determined as will head-to-head comparison with other commercially available influenza vaccine formulations.
This Direct to Phase 2 SBIR proposal will expand development of this platform to novel influenza antigen designs
in preparation for clinical translation."

Artificial Axon Labs Inc. (AAL), an MIT spinout, is developing a transformative drug screening platform, Artificial
Axons, to discover first-in-class remyelinating therapies for currently incurable myelin diseases, with the primary
focus on multiple sclerosis (MS). Current disease modifying therapies for MS prevent the formation of new
inflammatory lesions in the central nervous system (CNS), but the majority of prior lesions fail to remyelinate and
there are no clinically available therapies to promote remyelination and prevent neurodegeneration. One of the
major roadblocks in the discovery of remyelinating drugs is the lack of biomimetic drug screening tools that can
quantify myelination in response to screened compounds, and do it in the conditions that mimic the environment
of demyelinating MS lesions, which often contain factors that inhibit myelin repair. Assays based on tissues or
co-cultures of neurons with oligodendrocytes are too complex for effective drug screening. Current screening
methods typically rely on 2-dimensional assays that can only evaluate compounds’ potential to stimulate
differentiation of oligodendrocytes (myelinating cells in the CNS), but not an actual process of myelin wrapping,
which requires 3-dimensional axon-like structures. Existing in vitro 3D myelination assays such as glass cones
or electrospun fibers are made of materials several orders of magnitude stiffer than the nervous tissue, and
therefore provide unphysiological environment to myelinating cells. As the result, remyelinating drug candidates
discovered with these insufficient tools so far have limited success in the clinic.
 To address this urgent need, AAL is developing Artificial Axons, a novel biomimetic 3D-printed drug discovery
platform for remyelinating compounds. Unlike any other platform, our platform enables remyelinating drug
screening by direct visualization and quantification of myelin wrapping in response to compounds in the MS
lesion-like environment. We create this environment by combining 3D-printed axon mimics, matching the
geometry and low mechanical stiffness of biological axons, with key pro-inflammatory soluble factors, which
inhibit myelination in MS lesions (interferon gamma and myelin debris). These critical advantages over existing
assays make our platform a superior tool for the discovery of remyelinating compounds. In this project we focus
on two milestones: 1) developing a myelination assay, which includes common inflammatory factors that inhibit
myelin repair in MS lesions (interferon gamma and myelin debris), and 2) validating the new assay by testing
how the efficacy of known pro-myelinating compounds changes in the hostile environment of MS lesions.
Achieving these milestones will advance our technology on the path to commercialization and accelerate the
discovery of remyelinating treatments for MS and other myelin diseases."

Spatial navigation is a complex task that requires sensory processing, integration, and the creation of a spatial
map. Our project seeks to understand the role of auditory cues in spatial navigation. Traditionally, auditory
landmarks have been ignored with scientists looking instead at visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive cues. New
behavioral studies point to a human ability to use auditory landmarks in self-motion perception, balance, and
gait. Here, we seek to understand the role of auditory spatial landmarks in spatial navigation, assessed by careful
experimental manipulation of available sensory cues (auditory, visual, and self-motion cues) during a homing
task. We propose two aims to examine the role of audition in spatial navigation. In our first aim, we seek to
quantify how audition is integrated with other senses for human spatial encoding and navigation. We propose to
examine this in the framework of the maximum likelihood computational model (termed optimal cue-combination
model). We hypothesize that humans will use auditory information in an optimal manner, though auditory
information will contribute less to the spatial map than visual cues or self-motion cues. In the second aim, we
propose to examine the relative weight that individuals with sensory loss place on auditory information. We plan
to do this with virtual reality simulations of visual and self-motion sensory impairment in the acute setting. We
also plan to examine how individuals having a chronic sensory loss (longstanding low vision or vestibular
asymmetry) weight auditory landmarks for navigation. The proposed work will have a significant impact on the
field of multisensory integration and help generate potential new rehabilitation strategies for individuals suffering
from sensory impairment."

BioSpyder proposes to develop and validate a classifier test for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) that may also
classify other dementias. Biospyder will market this as an RUO, then pursue development as a definitive in
vitro diagnostic (IVD) test, addressing a major unmet need. The program is based on a very successful Phase
I. It was found that a classifier using whole blood from a finger-stick spotted on filter paper and assayed using
the whole transcriptome TempO-Seq® gene expression assay (the WBFP TempO-Seq assay) produced
signatures for both AD and Parkinsons’s Disease that permitted a classifier to be built that identified each
initially with 87% accuracy. After retraining with additional AD samples, the WBFP TempO-Seq AD classifier
identified 100% of an independent testing cohort of AD samples correctly, and identified immune cell functional
pathways underlying the signature. AD is the most common form of dementia, with the risk of developing AD 1
in 5 for women, 1 in 10 for men. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can be noticed years before those patients
can be diagnosed with AD or another dementia, years of uncertainty, no treatment, lost time to prepare for a
future with AD. That diagnosis requires cognitive testing administered by a neurologist, with in some cases
confirmation by a -amyloid PET scan. Biomarker immunoassays recently cleared under the Breakthrough
Device designation are not definitive and require cognitive testing or a -amyloid PET scan for diagnosis, and
require drawing blood or collecting cerebral spinal fluid. Thus, the still unmet need for a definitive IVD. In this
Phase II we will validate the performance of the WBFP TempO-Seq assay to classify AD patients, ability to
classify patients with other dementias, establish how early after presenting with MCI patients can be identified
with AD, correlate the WBFP TempO-Seq assay classification to -amyloid PET scans and immunoassay,
implement/validate performance of a focused WBFP TempO-Seq AD or pan-dementia test, and prepare the
materials for, and meet with, the FDA in a pre-IDE meeting to discuss the studies required for an application for
clearance as an IVD. The WBFP TempO-Seq whole transcriptome, focused, AD and focused pan-dementia
tests will be marketed for RUO use to identify novel therapeutic targets, characterize the progression from MCI
to AD, facilitate drug discovery efforts and selection/classification of patients, and potentially for development
as companion diagnostic tests. If the WBFP TempO-Seq AD or pan-dementia tests are FDA cleared, they will
be transformative, not just by providing a definitive diagnosis of AD or other dementias, but potentially by
providing that diagnosis before a diagnosis by cognitive testing can be made, and as importantly, by enabling
self-collection of samples to address health disparities in families and populations that do not have affordable
or easy access to a neurologist. If providing early, definitive diagnosis, any clinic or physician (or family
members) can evaluate persons for AD and potentially other dementias, broadening the network able to
provide diagnosis and focusing the role of the neurologist onto therapy and care."

 Candida auris is an emerging fungal pathogen causing invasive infections worldwide with a high mortality
rate. Unlike other fungal pathogens, it is frequently hospital-acquired and easily transmit within healthcare
facilities, making it a critical and urgent public health concern. A unique virulence trait of C. auris is its ability to
achieve extremely high levels of skin colonization, which not only serves as a source for nosocomial transmission
but also as a risk factor for the development of subsequent life-threatening bloodstream infections.
 In the model fungal pathogen Candida albicans, tissue adhesion and invasion are mediated by cell surface-
exposed proteins known as adhesins, which include the agglutinin-like sequence (ALS) protein family and
hyphal-regulated cell wall (Hyr/Iff) protein family. C. auris encodes genes homologous to characterized C.
albicans ALS and Hyr/Iff adhesin families. While the function and regulation of adhesins in tissue adhesion and
invasion have been explored to a limited extent in C. albicans, no mechanistic studies have investigated the
molecular machinery governing skin colonization in C. auris. C. auris clinical isolates identified so far are divided
into five independent clades, with Clades I, III, and IV being pathogenic and associated with outbreaks of invasive
infections. I, and others, have identified clade-specific abilities in colonizing skin by C. auris: Clade IV shows
higher skin colonization compared to Clade I even though they encode the same set of adhesin genes. Therefore,
I hypothesize that there is clade-specific genetic circuitry governing skin colonization in C. auris.
 To address this hypothesis, I will leverage the molecular genetic tools developed by our lab and my
established in vitro keratinocyte and in vivo animal models to determine the genetic mechanisms underlying skin
colonization in both Clade I and Clade IV. My preliminary data suggest that Clade I relies on specific adhesin
genes to adhere to keratinocytes. I will examine their roles in skin colonization using the in vivo murine model. I
also identified that Swi1, a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, positively regulates the
transcription of adhesin genes in Clade I. I will characterize this transcriptional regulation by comparing
nucleosome occupancy at promoters of critical adhesin genes in both wild-type and SWI/SNF-deficient mutants,
along with assessing SWI/SNF enrichment. To investigate mechanisms contributing to the increased skin
colonization in Clade IV, I will first define the function of individual adhesins in keratinocyte adherence and in
vivo skin colonization by generating targeted mutations of adhesins in this clade. I will then employ an unbiased
forward genetics screen using high-throughput imaging-based analysis to identify additional genes required for
skin colonization in Clade IV. This approach has led to the discovery of two factors that substantially contribute
to keratinocyte adherence. By characterizing the mechanisms underlying C. auris skin colonization in different
clades, I aim to reveal key vulnerabilities, both conserved and clade-specific, in this emerging fungal pathogen."
10799546,"Pancreatic ß-cells store insulin and release it in response to an elevation of blood glucose. Additionally, with
each meal, healthy ß-cells synthesize new insulin to replace what they have lost. The synthesis pathway begins
with introducing into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) on average ~6,000 new proinsulin molecules every second
per ß-cell. Under normal conditions, these molecules must fold their insulin moiety to the native state, including
the formation of 3 evolutionarily conserved disulfide bonds. However, we have now definitively identified
proinsulin misfolded states that occur in the ER of human islets, rodent islets, or ß-cell lines, and get worse (more
abundant) with perturbations of the ER folding environment. We believe that this is an important contributor to
abnormally increased ß-cell ER stress – and it is even worse in the disease of Mutant INS-gene induced Diabetes
of Youth (MIDY) – caused by any one of >30 heterozygous (dominant-negative) INS gene coding sequence
mutations. A portion of the work in the current proposal will focus on MIDY models, but we also present important
new data highlighting the formation of misfolded protein complexes containing proinsulin that are especially
abundant in islet ß-cells without INS mutation, preceding the onset of type 2 diabetes (T2D). In our first
Aim, we will further analyze the ER environment and diabetogenic conditions promoting the formation of
misfolded complexes of proinsulin, using molecular, cellular, and physiological tools. In our second Aim, we
propose to understand more about the molecular mechanism of misfolding by using various MIDY models, and
particularly, we propose experiments that will allow us to determine how much misfolded proinsulin must
accumulate in order to trigger diabetes. Finally, in our third Aim, we propose a strategy to limit proinsulin
misfolding with the intent to ameliorate, delay, or prevent diabetes."

 Clostridioides difficile is the leading cause of hospital-acquired gastrointestinal infections in the United
States. Pathogenesis is mediated by secreted toxins that cause the death of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and
breakdown of the intestinal barrier. C. difficile infection is primarily treated with antibiotics; however, the high rate
of recurrent infections necessitates alternative treatment options. Our lab has found that orally administering a
toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist, R848, protects mice against severe disease following lethal C. difficile
challenge. R848 treatment induces the expression of inflammatory cytokines including interferons. Interestingly,
while protection was not dependent on type I or type II interferon signaling, we found that mice deficient for type
III interferon (IFN-λ) signaling are not protected following R848 treatment. While IFN-λ is best known for its role
in antiviral immunity, recent works by others has shown that IFN-λ stimulates intestinal stem cell proliferation to
reduce the severity of experimental colitis. This proposal seeks to determine the mechanism by which IFN-λ
contributes to R848-mediated protection against C. difficile infection. The overarching hypothesis for this
project is that IFN-λ directly acts on IECs to stimulate stem cell proliferation and thereby repairing the
damage to the intestinal barrier from C. difficile toxin. Aim 1 will identify the critical cell type that responds
to IFN-λ for R848-mediated protection against C. difficile infection using bone marrow chimeric mice and cell-
lineage specific knockout mice. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that IFN-λ promotes intestinal stem cell function
and stimulates proliferation by utilizing Lgr5EGFP reporter mice and intestinal organoid culture models. This project
will elucidate the mechanism behind a novel role for IFN-λ in the immune response against C. difficile and may
inform future development of therapeutics against this major public health threat."

 There is a high burden of environmental metal exposure in the U.S. In rural communities, this is often
from contamination of groundwater from mining and natural sources and use of well water for cooking and
drinking. In urban settings, recent water contamination events in Flint, Michigan and Jackson, Mississippi,
among other communities, have highlighted vulnerabilities to failures in water safety. Metal exposure remains
disproportionately high among minoritized populations and those with lower socioeconomic status in both rural
or urban settings. Across a broad panel of different metals, including arsenic, cadmium, lead, and uranium,
high levels of exposure are known to damage kidney tubules. Yet, the health consequences of lower levels of
metal exposure have not been elucidated, principally because sensitive markers of kidney tubule damage had
been lacking. Recently, methods for assessing metal levels in biospecimens and in the water supply, have

An increased incidence of various pre-existing conditions like diabetes and hypertension, combined with
systemic issues surrounding the quality of maternal health care provided, has resulted in a significant increase
in the cesarean delivery rate in minority communities. These surgical procedures contribute to disparities in
maternal health outcomes and postoperative complications, as C-sections increase the likelihood of pelvic
adhesion formation. These adhesions are a leading cause of infertility, pain, and increased delivery time for
subsequent births, and the disproportionate administration of these procedures in minority communities (i.e.
these women are 33% more likely to undergo cesarean delivery) means these repercussions may be found more
frequently in these populations. Current products for adhesion prevention are difficult to apply in gynecologic
procedures and fail to properly address this severe surgical complication. Luna Labs’ patented AeroVeil
technology, a two-component sprayable hydrogel, has been demonstrated effective in decreasing the incidence
and severity of abdominal adhesion formation in rat and rabbit models. The proposed program will focus on
transitioning product application from these abdominal adhesion models into wound healing and efficacy
models of gynecologic applications to evaluate the safety and efficacy of product application in this space.
Successful completion of these efforts will drive technology transition and regulatory approval to support the
initiation of clinical trials with a commercial partner and reduce the needless surgical complications suffered by
women in minority communities."
10822485,"Antibody therapeutics are becoming increasingly important across a broad range of
indications, yet their development requires discovery from a variety of difficult sources.
Traditional technologies are over four decades old, while newer single-cell approaches for
mining survivors are gaining traction in the wake of the SARS-Cov2 pandemic. However, all
mainstream discovery approaches significantly limit the sampling of the in-vivo antibody immune
response, thereby potentially missing important therapeutic candidates. Approaches to better
deconvolute the antibody response with high-throughput sequencing technologies have begun
to be applied for research uses. However, using these large-scale data to directly perform
antibody discovery has remained elusive.
 We aim to develop software to streamline the incorporation of high-throughput
sequencing into the three mainstream discovery approaches, thereby reducing time and
increasing discovery success rate. These software-enabled enhancements will cover
high-throughput sequencing for hybridoma discovery, enhanced enrichment analysis for display
methods, and simplified workflow analysis for popular single-cell methods. The same type of
repertoire sequencing can then be used in a different context to improve candidate antibodies
by leveraging the natural improvements the host individual’s immune system has already
discovered. This expansion of existing candidates is enabled by the deep sequencing of
antibody repertoires using next-generation sequencing technology that provides a window into
the natural antibody evolution and optimization. These newly deep repertoires are able to be
exploited by novel algorithms for analyzing the large antibody families produced, as well as
advances in deep learning that enable large amounts of unlabeled data to be synthesized and
used for model training to search both across antibody families for similarities, as well as within
those families."
10822891,"Project Summary
Heparin is an essential drug, in the form of a complex polysaccharide, which is routinely used in the clinic for
treatment and prevention of thrombosis. About 300,000 doses are administered daily in the United States, and
the worldwide market for heparin is about $7B. Pharmaceutical heparin is purified from pig intestines, sourced
primarily from slaughterhouses in China. With hundreds of millions of slaughtered pigs, the cost of unfractionated
heparin has been extremely low. However, supply chain regulation is difficult, and lead to the heparin crisis in
2007 & 2008 due to economically motivated adulteration of crude heparin. This resulted in over 200 deaths
worldwide. The problem was caused by Blue Ear Disease, decimating Asian pig populations and driving up the
prices. More recently (2019), the African Swine Virus outbreak again decimated Asian pig populations.
Congressional leaders and regulatory agencies continue to be concerned about adulteration and shortages and
our recent experience with pandemics should be a warning that relying on foreign animal populations
for an essential drug is too risky. As an alternative, TEGA has engineered a novel mastocytoma cell line
(MST) to produce recombinant heparin with the same anticoagulant activity as porcine derived heparin. Like
other biologicals, recombinant heparin is produced under completely controlled conditions that significantly
reduces the risks of shortages and provides more consistent products. Higher structural consistency would
reduce the major heparin side effect (bleeding). Through cell engineering, we can also reduce the risk of heparin
induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), perhaps the second most important heparin side effect. Thus, recombinant
heparin would be a premium product in a stratified market aimed at patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass
surgery as well as other critical hospital procedures. Optimizing production and reducing cost are critical for
introducing an alternative to porcine heparin. Here, TEGA proposes to collaborate with Sciperio, an advanced
manufacturing company, using their technology to optimize production. Sciperio uses a unique bioreactor design
which facilitates greater control over cell growth and production parameters and actively removes waste
products. Furthermore, these bioreactors can recycle growth factors in a novel process that increases cell
number while reducing cost. Greater control has proven to be especially valuable for alternatives to the standard
production cell types (i.e., CHO, HEK293) which is a direct benefit for the engineered MST cell lines proposed
here. Advances in this area will advance biological manufacturing for applications more complex than antibody
production. The goal of this proposal is to optimize the growth media and growth parameters of our heparin
producing cells in Sciperio’s advanced bioreactor format, increasing the efficiency of production, thus reducing
the cost. This project is directly relevant to the Presidents September 12th Executive Order triggering
biotech as a front in economic competition with China."

 The US opioid epidemic costs over $1.5T and over 75,000 deaths annually. An understudied risk factor
for opioid use disorder (OUD) and its treatment is the importance of sleep and circadian rhythms (CR).
Opioids impact sleep quality in a fashion that inhibits recovery, and sleep remains a critical factor even when
patients enter treatment: the two most efficacious medications for OUD (MOUD) also cause sleep problems
that contribute to suboptimal outcomes. To address the enormous costs of the opioid epidemic, it is essential
to understand the mechanisms underlying the relationship between MOUD, poor sleep, and negative
outcomes. Thus, our central hypothesis is that examination of sleep and circadian phenotypes, will help to
identify individuals on MOUD who will benefit from specific interventions. Characterization of the bidirectional
interplay between sleep behaviors, sleep architecture, circadian rhythms, and neurocognitive measures in
individuals on MOUD is a crucial first step in identifying potential mechanisms or modifiable variables to
improve MOUD outcomes. Identifying the specific type of sleep/circadian disruption by MOUD may highlight
adjunctive treatment options to address the relevant sleep problem (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy for
insomnia). Moreover, MOUDs disrupt sleep, but it is not known whether this is via alterations of CR or
alterations of sleep behavior/architecture. Sleep/CR science provides experimental methods for separating
circadian timing from sleep physiology in the form of the 90-minute day. Prior work highlights neurocognitive
phenotypes, craving and emotion regulation (ER), that are critical for successful MOUD outcomes. Cravings
are both an OUD symptom and frequent predictor of relapse. Sleep quality affects craving possibly through
positive and negative affect, emphasizing that ER is of critical concern with MOUD, as patients report an
inability to regulate emotions as a primary motivation for use and for relapse. Poor sleep is associated with
diminished ER. In 100 individuals on MOUD we will 1) evaluate (a) naturally occurring sleep patterns using
activity monitoring for one week and (b) sleep physiology through polysomnographic recording in the sleep lab
to contribute to the common aim across research sites and to provide descriptive analyses; 2) examine sleep
and circadian phenotypes using variables collected via actigraphy, PSG, and the 90-min day protocol to
examine associations of these phenotypes with neurocognitive mechanisms that may impact outcome of OUD
treatment including craving and emotion regulation; and 3) use qualitative methods to investigate the
acceptability, feasibility, and perceived utility of interventions targeting the specific mechanistic relationships
hypothesized. In summary, we plan a comprehensive examination of novel pathways between sleep/circadian
rhythms and neurocognitive factors —craving and emotion regulation—critical to success in MOUD as putative
mechanisms underpinning the association of poor sleep and suboptimal treatment outcomes."
10786691,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Firearm injury and death is a public health epidemic that spreads through communities and
social networks in the United States much like an infectious disease. Individuals who survive a
firearm injury (i.e., nonfatal survivors), experience increases in the risk of adverse health
outcomes, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression. Family
members of homicide victims, nonfatal firearm injury survivors (i.e., secondary survivors), and
communities more broadly are also affected. Due to methodological limitations, we have very
little data on what trauma networks (defined as individual(s) present at a shooting event and/or
family member(s) of a fatal victim/nonfatal survivor) look like and much less on the long-term
health effects of being in the network of a firearm injury. This is a critical question because these
trauma networks – people exposed but not injured – are likely at high risk of adverse health
outcomes, particularly children, adolescents, and young adults (CAYA) and are currently being
missed in firearm injury focused interventions. The proposed study will use an existing data
repository (used in prior work) of individually linked records from healthcare and police data
between 2016 - 2022. We specifically aim to 1) develop and describe trauma networks of all
individuals (i.e., victims, witnesses per police data) present at a shooting event and/or all family
members of firearm injury victims/survivors per Medicaid data and 2) examine clinical utilization,
firearm injury, and mortality outcomes among CAYA network members, due to the high risk of
adverse health outcomes in the 5-years following firearm injury event. This study will
demonstrate defining trauma networks to identify CAYA exposed to firearm injury is feasible
(Aim 1) and estimate prevalence rates of mental health outcomes, firearm injury, and mortality
among network members (Aim 2) in order to identify future opportunities for interventions.
SIGNIFICANCE: Consistent with the NICHD strategic plan, our methodology, data
infrastructure, and composition of our research team ensures that our research will significantly
extend our understanding of the mechanisms and impacts of firearm injury events beyond the
individual directly involved to improve health across the lifespan. Regardless of the results, this
will lead to a R01 application addressing the health needs among CAYA within trauma networks
and inform interventions that may mitigate adverse and likely debilitating effects among CAYA
and will have implications for broader public health significance."
10789824,"PROJECT SUMMARY
It was recently reported that tampons, a menstrual hygiene product used by over half the population of people
who menstruate, release up to 17 billion nanoplastic particles per use. However, neither the chemical
characteristics of the tampon nanoplastic particles nor the physiological effects of these particles coming in direct
contact with gynecological tissues have been identified. Therefore, the overall goal of this application is to define
both the chemical characteristics of tampon nanoplastic particles as well as their downstream physiological
effects on the gynecological tissue, Typically, the mucosal epithelial barriers of the vagina and cervix serve as
protective barriers against infection and disease, yet there is currently very little known about how nanoplastics
penetrate these barriers, which could potentially induce inflammation, oxidative stress, and dysregulated
hormonal signaling, which cumulatively can lead to cervical and endometrial cancer, vaginosis, endometriosis,
and impaired fertility. Furthermore, there is growing appreciation that exposure to biologically relevant
environments can cause a corona of biological components to form around nanoparticles, altering the surface
morphology and enhancing the internalization of plastic particles. Thus, our overarching hypothesis is that
proteins found in menstrual blood adsorb to the surface of the nano-plastic particles shed from tampons, forming
a biological corona that enables them to penetrate and disrupt cervical and vaginal mucosal membranes. This
hypothesis with be explored by pursuing the following aims: 1. Characterize the surface chemistry of tampon
nanoplastics shed in a biologically relevant environment; and 2. Determine the role of the biological coronas on
tampon nanoplastics' ability to penetrate cervical and vaginal mucosal barriers and detrimentally affect
downstream signaling cascades. The proposed research is significant, because it will provide a comprehensive
overview of the biophysical interactions between tampon nanoplastics, the physiological environment they
encounter, and the gynecological tissue they come in contact with. Absent such insights, people who menstruate
will continue to have insufficient information on the potential detrimental health effects of tampon use."

Parental environmental influences such as diet affect energy metabolism in the next generation
but the underlying mechanisms for such transgenerational epigenetic inheritance are not well-
understood. While small RNAs, histone modifications and DNA methylation in germ cells can
function as signals mediating transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, very little is known on the
mechanisms how these signals are regulated. This in part due to a lack of genetic model systems,
suitable for carrying out detailed investigations.
The X-linked gene Rlim encodes a RING finger E3 ligase that functions as a major epigenetic
regulator in female mice, as it is crucial for imprinted X chromosome inactivation (iXCI), the
epigenetic silencing of the paternally transmitted X chromosome in female preimplantation
embryos to achieve X dosage compensation. Indeed, a maternally transmitted Rlim KO allele
results in early embryonic lethality in females, while males lacking Rlim grow into adulthood. We
recently showed that in testes of males Rlim is highly expressed both in Sertoli cells (SCs) and
in spermatogenic cells at the round spermatid stage. Despite being fertile, mice with systemic
ablation of Rlim produce less sperm which additionally is dysfunctional. Targeting a conditional
KO (cKO) to testicular cell types, our published results demonstrate that Rlim activity in
spermatogenic cells but not SCs is required for normal spermatogenesis.
We found that offspring sired by fathers systemically lacking Rlim is protected from high fat diet
(HFD)-induced obesity in a transgenerational epigenetic effect. Targeting the cKO of Rlim in
fathers, we demonstrate that lack of Rlim in SCs recapitulates this effect. As paternal signals
transmitting transgenerational effects are transmitted in sperm, our unpublished results provide
genetic evidence for a novel SCspermHFD-response in offspring pathway.
Our future research research will exploit our unique Rlim cKO mice to investigate this pathway
to A) elucidate molecular mechanisms of Rlim action in SCs, B) identify the epigenetic signal in
sperm and how it is generated, and C) uncover downstream effects in offspring ultimately
leading to changes in HFD-response.
The overarching goal of the future research is to establish the Rlim mouse model as a novel
paradigm for transgenerational epigenetic regulation. This research will define the SCsperm
offspring pathway in a larger biological context and, using cutting edge technologies, will identify
new and fundamental epigenetic mechanisms."
10791927,"Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables the ability to probe both tissue microstructure and
structural connectivity of the central nervous system. However, there are no validated methods to model and
interrogate the pathways that connect the brain and spinal cord, which inhibits our ability to fully characterize
and understand the complete damage that may occur in neurological disorders. For example, disease
progression in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) is known to stem from axonal damage in both the brain and
spinal cord, yet, coordinated medical image analysis of both structures simultaneously has not been shown.
Thus, the overall goal of the proposed research is to develop and optimize simultaneous tissue microstructural
mapping of the brain and spinal cord for clinical assessment of MS using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
specifically interrogating the microstructure and connectivity of motor pathways of the central nervous system.
The critical challenges to this goal are (1) quantifying tissue microstructure of the brain and spinal cord in
unison has not been performed, (2) clinical MRI lacks specificity for microstructural tissue integrity, and (3)
there are few methods available that allow mapping of MS lesions and pathological abnormalities in relation to
critical fiber pathways. To address this, in Aim 1 we will develop a cohesive acquisition and image processing
pipeline, minimizing artifacts and maximizing reproducibility, in order to facilitate a unified analysis of the
central nervous system. In Aim 2, we will utilize diffusion MRI modeling and fiber tractography to characterize
tissue microstructure and connectivity from the cortex to the spinal cord. Modeling will enable quantification of
highly specific pathophysiological indices of edema, axonal swelling, demyelination, and axonal loss, whereas
tractography will facilitate feature localization to specific white matter pathways and along specific pathways.
Finally, evaluate microstructure and connectivity of the motor pathways to interrogate pathology in MS,
quantifying radiological biomarkers over space and time that may contribute to impairment in this disease. The
overall impact of this proposal will be quantitative biomarkers for disease burden that may improve the value of
imaging the brain and spinal cord together as it relates to understanding pathology in vivo."
10789264,"The use of exogenous nucleic acids has great potential for therapeutic applications in numerous diseases,
including cancer. However, the delivery of nucleic acids is challenging, as they face numerous biological barriers,
and thus require sophisticated delivery platform technologies. Despite the development of many promising non-
viral carrier technologies, such as lipids, polymers, and peptides, achieving a clearer understanding of the
mechanisms they employ to facilitate cell entry of nucleic acid-based drug cargos is, in-part, critical to advancing
their clinical translation. As such, in our quest to further the development of a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP)
carrier design for siRNA-based human oral and oropharyngeal cancer (OOC) therapy, we recently reported that
a particular peptide variant, RD3AD, which exhibited enhanced siRNA uptake and gene silencing compared to
the parent CPP, was found to direct siRNAs to specific cell-surface protrusions, identified as filopodia.
Intriguingly, filopodia are highly dynamic, elongated, and thin cellular processes that have been reported to
facilitate the highly efficient cellular entry of viruses, bacteria, exosomes, and other biological
macromolecules/complexes. Moreover, because filopodia function as sensory antennae in probing the cellular
environment, which is important for cell motility through complex 3D microenvironments, they contain cell-surface
receptors, such as integrins, that can interact with and interpret extracellular cues. Interestingly, integrins have
been reported to assemble along filopodia in similar localization patterns as RD3AD-siRNA complexes, thus
implying that the RD3AD peptide carrier potentially targets integrins on filopodia as a means of cell entry. With
filopodia having also been implicated in driving cancer cell migration and invasion, with their densities and lengths
correlated with cancer progression and increased invasiveness, and increased levels of integrins also being
associated with OOC and metastasis, the goal of the current proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms underlying
filopodia-mediated intracellular uptake of the RD3AD-siRNA complex, as well as determine its ability to target
and deliver siRNAs to migrating/invading cancer cells. To accomplish this goal, we will use biochemical and
molecular biology approaches to: (1) uncover the mechanisms of filopodia-directed cell entry of the RD3AD-
siRNA complex in oral cancer cells; and (2) demonstrate the ability of RD3AD to target and deliver complexed
siRNAs to migrating/invading cancer cells and 3D tumor spheroids in vitro, as well as malignant tumors in vivo.
The outcomes of the proposed high-risk, high-reward research are expected to uncover the mechanisms
governing the intracellular delivery of the RD3AD-siRNA complex via its associations with filopodia and/or
integrins, as well as its propensity to target migrating/invading cancer cells. The significance being that the
knowledge gained will aid in future and more informed development of a CPP-based molecular targeted nucleic
acid therapy for human OOC intervention."

Brain injuries affect millions of infants each year and may cause irreversible cell death. Visualizing cell death in
their brains is challenging. There is a need for non-invasive and easy-to-implement bedside imaging methods
which can be performed safely, and repeatedly and have the ability to detect cell death in the brain.
Cell death in infant brains can occur after hypoxia/ischemia, stroke, trauma, or exposure to sedative/anesthetic
or antiseizure medications and presents in different forms (necrosis, apoptosis, autophagy). Structural features
of cell death modify the acoustic scattering properties of tissue, therefore reflecting ultrasound differently from
viable cells. Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) has been used to detect the unique scattering properties of apoptotic
cells in cancer and necrotic cells in cultures. Low cost, portability, lack of need for contrast agents, and rapid
image acquisition and processing make QUS appealing for the in vivo detection of cell death in infants.
Our group has applied these techniques to study cell death in the brains of newborn non-human primates (NHPs)
exposed to sevoflurane anesthesia. Within the thalamus, a region that undergoes apoptosis after prolonged
sevoflurane administration in infancy, we detected changes in the “effective scatterer size” (ESS) and confirmed
histologically that apoptosis was present in this brain region. Notably, a strong correlation between changes in
ESS and the severity of histologically detected apoptosis was confirmed.
Furthermore, we performed pilot studies in four typically developing human neonates, whose fontanels are
excellent sonographic windows, and produced high-quality ultrasound brain images and QUS measurements
with consistent values.
Here we want to apply knowledge gained from the NHP work and develop QUS technology that will enable
capturing cell death in neonatal human brains. First, we will optimize QUS acquisition and analysis of echo data
in typically developing human neonatal brains and obtain normative data for key QUS features in selected brain
regions in the basal ganglia. These regions are the caudate nucleus (CN), globus pallidus (GP), putamen (Put),
and thalamus (Th). Then, we will apply QUS in neonates with brain injury caused by perinatal asphyxia. In
these brains, hypoxic/ischemic cell death can occur in the CN, GP, Put, and Th, and is accompanied by diffusion
restriction on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We expect that QUS features obtained from the CN, GP, Put,
and Th in neonates with perinatal asphyxia, who demonstrate diffusion restriction and altered apparent diffusion
coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps in the basal ganglia on MRIs, will differ from those in
typically developing human neonates.
The translational significance of this research is immense. QUS may enable the study of when and where cell
death occurs in infants’ brains and follow its time evolution. It may provide invaluable means of neuromonitoring
in neurocritical care, help address fundamental research questions and assist in optimizing clinical treatments."

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is uniquely able to achieve high depth resolution of several microns
while imaging a large 3-dimensional (3D) volume. It is already widely used by ophthalmologists to diagnose
diseases of the cornea and guide treatments. We aim to extend the range of applications further by pushing
the envelope on the ultrahigh-resolution front. The specific aims are to:
 (1) Develop and validate ultrahigh-resolution OCT microscopy (OCM) using short-wavelength
light sources. The recent availability of visible coherent light sources enables the development of OCT
microscopy with a higher transverse resolution, potentially better than the current standard for corneal
microscopy (in vivo corneal confocal microscopy or IVCM). We will develop an ultrahigh-speed line-scan
spectral-domain OCT with dynamic focusing. The goal is to achieve one-micron resolution non-contact
volumetric corneal imaging within a few seconds, enabling greater ease of use, faster scan times, and the
ability to visualize more clinically relevant microscopic structures within the cornea compared to IVCM.
 (2) Explore the diagnostic potential of ultrahigh-resolution OCM for infectious keratitis and
keratoconus. These are two of the most common causes of corneal blindness globally. IVCM can visualize
large corneal pathogens (fungus and amoeba), but not bacteria which are the most common cause of
infectious keratitis. IVCM is also not capable of visualizing collagen bundles within the cornea, the site of the
primary structural changes caused by keratoconus. Our preliminary findings indicate OCM can visualize fungus
and bacteria in addition to larger corneal pathogens as well as collagen bundles in rabbit corneas. Identification
of these structures could significantly improve the diagnosis of infectious keratitis and keratoconus. The
theoretically superior usability of OCM compared to IVCM may also enable wider adoption of corneal
microscopy. We will complete pilot ex vivo and in vivo clinical studies comparing OCM against IVCM for the
diagnosis of infectious keratitis and keratoconus. Earlier determination of the correct diagnosis would allow for
faster initiation of targeted therapy and improved visual outcomes in these common, potentially blinding
conditions."

The incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is rapidly increasing in youth, particularly in youth of color, and if
uncontrolled can lead to devastating complications as early as 10 years after diagnosis. Yet, there are limited
medication options for youth, who have worse response to available therapies such as metformin compared to
adults. There is therefore a critical need for the development of targeted and effective treatment approaches that
utilize the most appropriate therapeutic option right from the onset of disease. T2D is a heterogenous disease
with variations in mechanistic pathways related to insulin sensitivity, insulin deficiency, obesity and fat distribution
that contribute to disease progression. Methods to subtype individuals with T2D have been developed using
clinical and genomic machine learning based clustering approaches in adults. However, these clustering
approaches have not been evaluated in youth of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds and using clinical
variables that are routinely measured in clinical practice. In K23 funded work, Principal Investigator Dr.
Srinivasan is evaluating the genetic and pharmacological determinants of metformin response in youth with T2D.
The proposed R03 work will broaden the scope of this work by evaluating the pathophysiological patterns
associated with the development of complications and metformin response in youth, a framework that can be
applied to other T2D medications beyond metformin. In this study, we propose to leverage existing pediatric T2D
datasets and utilize complementary clinical and genetic machine-learning clustering techniques to identify groups
of youth with T2D at highest risk for microvascular complications and most likely to fail metformin treatment,
based on underlying biological mechanisms. In Aim 1, we will categorize 974 youth with T2D from the Treatment
Options for Type 2 diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) and SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth (SEARCH)
studies into pathophysiological subgroups based on clinical clusters developed in adults and evaluate the
association of cluster membership with T2D progression, development of microvascular complications and
metformin response. Additionally, we will develop and evaluate novel youth clusters based on routine clinical
variables using an unsupervised machine learning technique and will compare the performance with adult
clusters. In Aim 2, we will construct individual level polygenic scores derived from genetic clustering of T2D loci
and based on mechanistic pathways in TODAY and SEARCH to evaluate the association of genetic scores with
the same outcomes proposed in Aim 1, both alone and in combination with clinical clusters. In Aim 3, we will
validate youth-derived clinical and genomic clusters in a real-world electronic medical record-based youth
dataset from the Boston Children’s Hospital Precision Link Biobank for Health Discovery. This proposal will
generate a prediction model that leverages both routine clinical and genomic data to inform risk stratification and
to improve metformin prescribing. These results, in combination with Dr. Srinivasan’s K23 work will directly inform
a future R01 proposal evaluating precision dosing algorithms for metformin and other drug classes in youth."

Vascular endothelial growth factor-A is a critical angiogenic factor that dramatically improves the vascularization
in the obese adipose tissue, which thus protects transgenic mice not only against high-fat-diet-induced obesity
but also insulin resistance. However, the precise mechanism underlining these metabolic benefits remains to be
determined. Our preliminary results suggest that the function of vascular endothelial growth factor-A is
associated with the upregulation of another angiogenic factor, angiopoietin-2. Moreover, Vascular endothelial
growth factor-A stimulates sympathetic activation, enhancing lipolysis and energy expenditure in adipose tissue.
This proposal is built upon these observations and the multitude of Vascular endothelial growth factor-A-related
mouse models to dissect the complex physiological actions of this growth factor in adipose tissue. It is
hypothesized that vascular endothelial growth factor-A synergistically interacts with angiopoietin-2 to form the
functional new blood vessels in adipose tissue, promoting energy expenditure in a sympathetic activation-
dependent manner. Specifically, two Aims are proposed: 1). To determine the role of angiopoietin-2 in vascular
endothelial growth factor-A mediated angiogenesis in adipose tissue; 2). To investigate the mechanisms by
which vascular endothelial growth factor-A-induced neuronal factors function on endothelial cells to improve
angiogenesis in adipose tissue. The novel genetic models and pharmacological tools will be applied to achieve
these Aims. Successful completion of the proposed studies will demonstrate the essential contribution of
vascular endothelial growth factor-A to the dynamics of adipose tissue remodeling during both physiological
(exercise and cold exposure) and pathological (obesity) conditions and highlight it as a factor with clinical
significance in obesity and related diseases, which will provide insights for my independent R01 application."
10786600,"Current interventions for depression lack the capability to directly, precisely, and noninvasively engage the
deep brain circuits at the core of the illness. We have developed a non-significant-risk, MRI-compatible,
individually-targeted, ultrasonic neuromodulation device that can stimulate deep circuits in humans
noninvasively with a precision previously achievable only with surgically implanted electrodes. This R61/R33
project will evaluate the potential for this novel device to engage deep brain targets and modulate mood
symptoms in individuals with treatment-resistant depression. The R61 phase will demonstrate target
engagement by delivering low-intensity ultrasound to the subcallosal cingulate during functional magnetic
resonance imaging. This phase aims to evaluate the intensity dependence, target specificity, and tolerability
of this neuromodulation intervention. If predefined go/no-go criteria are met, the R33 phase will then evaluate
the short-term effects of subcallosal cingulate neuromodulation using a randomized sham-controlled study
design. The aims of this phase are to examine the associations between target engagement, short-term mood
changes, and immediate changes in brain functional connectivity. The R33 also aims to evaluate tolerability
and feasibility of a subsequent efficacy trial. This project will address an unmet need by providing new,
noninvasive, circuit-directed treatment options for patients with treatment-resistant depression. Because this
ultrasonic neuromodulation device offers access to deep brain structures with a unique combination of

understanding and treating other disorders of deep brain circuits."
10789357,"1 Background: Social determinants of health (SDoH) and healthcare inequities influence the advanced illness
 2 experience of patients with heart failure (HF). HF is a serious, chronic, and progressive clinical syndrome
 3 affecting over 6 million (and rising) adults in the U.S. HF hospitalizations are reported in patients with late-stage,
 4 advanced disease and these patients often experience repeat hospitalizations, nearly one-third die within one
 5 year following a hospital admission for HF, and almost none survive past two years. Outcomes differ in racial
 6 groups, with rates of hospitalizations for HF almost 2.5 times higher in Black patients than white. These health
 7 disparities are further exacerbated as HF progresses to an advanced stage, where the general patient preference
 8 is to remain at home after being discharged from the hospital after an acute HF incident. While generally
 9 accepted that SDoH can be broadly used to identify patients at high risk for worse HF outcomes, what is not yet
10 known is whether any individual SDoH or groups of SDoH are key contributors, or drivers, of adverse health
11 outcomes or readmission after hospital discharge for an acute HF incident, particularly in diverse racial groups
12 with advanced HF. Therefore, we hypothesize that, by applying a combination of SDoH- and health-equity-
13 focused lenses of analysis to a highly diverse cohort of patients with advanced HF, we will be able to reveal the
14 individual, systematic, organizational, structural and/or community factors that drive post-hospitalization
15 outcomes, and, ultimately, lead to hospital readmission. Aim 1 Determine the associations between SDoH and
16 the 30- and 90-day post-hospitalization outcomes among racially diverse patients with advanced (Stage C/D)
17 HF. Aim 2 Identify HF patient perceptions and associated contextual factors of SDoH that influence the
18 achievement of goal-concordant care outcomes among patients with advanced HF living in the community.
19 Methods: We will conduct a prospective, concurrent mixed-methods triangulation study with quantitative and
20 qualitative (quant+QUAL) methodologies to contextualize the experiences of patients with advanced HF post-
21 hospitalization. Inclusion criteria: >18 years-old, hospitalized at the study site, diagnosed with advanced
22 (ACCF/AHA Stage C or D) HF, Meta-Analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart Failure Integer risk score >18
23 (range 0–52). Exclusion criteria: current enrollment in hospice, having a plan for cardiac procedures/surgical
24 therapy within six months, or having a documented non-cardiac terminal illness. Analysis: For binary readmission
25 outcomes, we will use multivariable logistic analysis to evaluate whether SDoH variables associated with
26 readmissions at 30 and/or 90 days. Qualitative analysis will be conducted on patient interviews with vanManen’s
27 phenomenological approach. Findings: Findings from this study will further health equity science by providing
28 the empirical and contextual evidence needed to fill gaps in our understanding about putative SDoH-related
29 individual, systematic, and community-based drivers of post-hospitalization patient-centered HF outcomes in
30 diverse populations with advanced HF."

Social animals, including humans, engage in complex collective behaviors in the field. While
there are simple models of collective decision making and movement that are amenable to
study in traditional laboratory environments, they inevitably fail to capture the full complexity
of natural behaviors as they occur in the field. Moreover, standard mammalian laboratory
species either exhibit only simple social behaviors (e.g., mice) or are too challenging to house
in large groups (e.g., primates). Here, we will leverage decades of extensive experience
studying sheep in their normal pasture settings and during interactions between ewes and
their lambs. We propose to develop a paradigm for acquiring high resolution (in space and
time) measurements of individual herd members, including head-mounted devices to sense
their visual sensorium. We will test these devices in existing herds maintained for agricultural
study, while also developing a robust paradigm for conducting neural recording experiments.
If successful this work will lay the foundation for future study of the neural circuits underlying
complex collective behaviors in a large-brained highly social animal model."

Alcohol use is common among people living with HIV (PWH) and is a consistent predictor of poor antiretroviral
therapy (ART) adherence. It has also been associated with HIV virologic failure and mortality, but these results
have been somewhat mixed and the relationships between level of alcohol use and these outcomes are not
well defined. Interventions to reduce alcohol use among PWH have shown modest or mixed results. Thus, the
level of alcohol use needed to cause harm for PWH and the efficacy of interventions to reduce the harm are
uncertain. This uncertainty stems in part from the near ubiquitous reliance on self-report to measure alcohol
use, which may be inaccurate due to recall bias or social desirability bias and lead to spurious or obscured
results, and from inconsistent alcohol measurement. Objective biomarkers can be leveraged to supplement
self-report or as alternatives to self-report. The leading alcohol biomarker is phosphatidylethanol (PEth), which
can be found in whole blood or dried blood spots, detects prior 2-4 weeks alcohol use, and is correlated with
total alcohol consumed. Several research studies of PWH have conducted or plan to conduct PEth testing,
making possible an unprecedented opportunity to pool a large number of observations with PEth and HIV data
to provide definitive answers to these questions. We propose the Biomarkers for Alcohol/HIV Research
(BAHR) Study to gather and pool these data, which will include more than 8,000 PWH with 15,000
observations, and use PEth to resolve past alcohol/HIV research uncertainties, to guide future interventions,
and to provide measurement guidance for future research. We will determine the relationship between PEth-
measured alcohol use and HIV virologic failure and mortality risk among PWH who are on ART using data from
six studies (Aim 1). We will conduct individual participant data meta-analyses of alcohol/HIV intervention
studies (15 have agreed to participate) to examine evidence of the efficacy of the interventions to reduce PEth-
measured alcohol use, and their further impact on virologic failure (Aim 2). For both these aims, we will
compare the results using PEth alone to those obtained using self-report alone, and self-report combined with
PEth, to guide future alcohol measurement in research. Lastly, because PEth is expensive and inaccessible in
low-resource and non-research settings, we will examine the predictive value of a combination of common
laboratory tests as a low-cost alternative to PEth testing, leveraging the extensive testing being conducted in a
6000-person study (Aim 3). These analyses will provide tangible advancements for the alcohol/HIV field,
namely definitive answers on the relationship of alcohol use to HIV virologic failure and mortality risk; the
efficacy of alcohol interventions studies to reduce alcohol use and decrease virologic failure; information on
the comparability of results using biomarkers versus self-report to measure alcohol use; and evidence on
the predictive ability of a low-cost alcohol risk score for further testing and potential increased availability in
low-resource and non-research settings."
10791786,"Esophageal motor function is a key player in both swallowing and airway protection, but these functions
have not been systematically investigated in proximal/striated esophagus (St.Eso) despite its proximity to the
airway and the risk of aspiration due to its dysfunction. Our preliminary studies reveal important novel findings
with significant clinical relevance about St.Eso functions that led to the development of hypotheses to be tested
in this proposal. There are two specific aims in this proposal.
 In Specific Aim I we will characterize the St.Eso deglutitive motor function and its modulation by pharyngeal
swallow biomechanics. We will test the following Hypotheses 1) St.Eso. motor function constitutes four distinct
components in relation to its deglutitive excursion associated with laryngeal elevation: a. Increased wall tension
commensurate to the magnitude of its anterosuperior excursion, b. Non-peristaltic bolus receiving function during
UES opening, c. Peristaltic / bolus transport function as it descends and d. Continued peristalsis in its resting
position. 2. Components of St.Eso motor function are correlated with and can be modulated by pharyngeal
biomechanics and related pressures.
 SA 1A: In healthy and patient volunteers, we will determine and characterize the: i. non-peristaltic and
peristaltic components of the St.Eso motor functions and their relationship with pharyngeal phase biomechanics,
ii. effect of experimentally enhancing and reducing pharyngeal biomechanics on St.Eso. motor functions, iii.
St.Eso peristalsis parameters and its modulation by bolus type, volume, body positions and age using state-of-
the-art concurrent HRM/impedance manometry/ digital video fluoroscopy and our novel experimental devices.
 SA 1B: In our feline model we will: i. characterize the relationship between superior laryngeal excursion
and components of St.Eso motor functions during swallowing, i.e. pre-peristaltic St.Eso wall tension, bolus
injection distance, and peristaltic magnitude, ii. determine the mechanisms of these functions, the possible
mechanisms include ENS and CNS neural reflex control and biomechanical properties of the St.Eso.
In specific Aim 2 we will Characterize the St.Eso. airway protective function and its relationship with that of the
UES and esophageal secondary peristalsis. We will test the following hypotheses: 1) St.Eso. responds to
reflux events independent of secondary peristalsis by a lumen occluding contraction fortifying the UES pressure
response. 2) This response is i. age dependent and is related to the type, quantity, and velocity of the refluxate
and ii. absent or discordant with the UES response in disease states.
 SA 2A: In healthy and patient volunteers we will characterize the St.Eso. responses to i. physiologic
reflux, and ii. simulated reflux events (non-acidic and acidic fluids with various volumes and rates).
 SA 2B: We will determine in both groups the: i. concordance of St.Eso and UES responses to simulated
and physiologic reflux events, ii. functional relationship of St.Eso. response to that of the secondary peristalsis."
10810726,"Project Summary
 Clostridium perfringens type F strains, which produce C. perfringens enterotoxin (CPE), are an important
cause of gastrointestinal (GI) disease, including the 2nd most common bacterial foodborne illness and several
nonfoodborne GI diseases. In people with preexisting severe constipation or fecal impaction, type F infections
can progress to lethal enterotoxemia, where CPE is absorbed from the intestines to damage organs such as the
liver. CPE is produced when type F strains are ingested and then sporulate in the GI tract. Cytotoxicity starts
with binding of CPE to claudin receptors to form a small complex. Six CPE small complexes then oligomerize on
the plasma membrane of intestinal cells to form a surface prepore. Each of the six CPE molecules in the prepore
extends a beta hairpin that inserts into the lipid bilayer to form a pore in the host cell plasma membrane. In vitro,
this pore triggers a calcium influx that activates calpain and induces (at low CPE concentrations) apoptosis or
(at high CPE concentrations) necroptosis. CPE-induced cell death and/or CPE effects on tight junctions (TJs)
then cause intestinal damage that induces luminal fluid accumulation in the small intestine and colon.
 Therapeutics against CPE-mediated type F GI disease could target either CPE action or production during
in vivo sporulation. For those efforts, or to improve use of CPE for translational applications such as cancer ther-
apy, it is necessary to better understand CPE action at the molecular and intestinal levels and to improve know-
ledge of early steps in C. perfringens sporulation and CPE production/processing in the intestines. Consequently,
this project will pursue 4 specific aims: Aim 1, CPE has a dual action, i.e., pore formation and TJ damage, so
we will evaluate if pore formation is necessary for CPE in vivo effects. A CPE point variant that binds and oligo-
merizes but does not form an active pore will be used to test the importance of pore formation when CPE causes
paracellular permeability effects on Caco-2 cells or enteritis and enterotoxemic death in animal models. Aim 2
will determine the importance/mechanism of indirect damage caused by CPE in vitro and in vivo. CPE binds
mainly to villus tip cells yet damages the entire intestinal villus, supporting the involvement of indirect damage
during CPE action in the intestines. Aim 2 will characterize a factor involved in CPE-induced bystander killing of
Caco-2 cells and test if this factor is active in the intestines. This Aim will also evaluate if a similar indirect killing
effect occurs in the CPE-treated intestines and if cytokine release contributes to intestinal damage. Aim 3 will
use CPE variants to further probe the CPE structure/function relationship. Molecular events in CPE action to be
examined include i) oligomerization, ii) contributions of a proline residue at the interface of the two CPE domains
to CPE action, and iii) interactions between CPE and the 1st extracellular domain of claudin receptors. Aim 4 will
study CPE processing and the regulation of sporulation/CPE production ex vivo using mouse intestinal lumen
contents and test if bile salts (or other lumen factors) initiate type F strain sporulation/CPE production."
10810814,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Patients with comorbid substance use (SUD) and anxiety disorders (AD) have significantly poorer health
outcomes than patients with SUD alone and experience increased risk for relapse. However, less than 10%
engage in treatment and only 18% of SUD facilities and 9% of mental health organizations report the capacity to
provide comprehensive care. Mobile health technologies have been increasingly applied for substance use and
anxiety treatments in an effort to create more comprehensive, patient centered approaches to care. Despite
increasing mobile application development, the majority of existing programs are designed to target SUD or
anxiety individually, few utilize evidence-based content or are clinically validated, and the majority are not
designed as integrative treatment components for patients with SUD-AD. The Unwinding Anxiety (UA) mobile
app can fulfill this need as it delivers digital, evidence-based psychoeducational training in a manualized,
scalable, and high-fidelity manner targeting mechanistic pathways consistent with previous research. The
proposed research will comprehensively assess the user experiences of UA for individuals with SUD-AD who
are in recovery and explore the role of exploratory behavioral and mental health outcomes (i.e., substance use,
craving, anxiety) among 48 individuals in long term recovery (>6 months). We will utilize a convergent parallel
mixed methods research study design involving the collection of both quantitative and qualitative measures
concurrently. We will quantitatively investigate usability, feasibility, and fidelity using the Systems Usability Scale,
educational module completion, and ecological check-in usage. Qualitatively we will collect data on usability of
UA within a sub-sample of participants (n=18) conducting focused interviews weekly (4 x <30 min. sessions;
n=18) and 3 focus groups (k=3; n=15). Our secondary aim is to determine the degree to which UA engages
exploratory outcomes specifically substance use, craving, and anxiety in preparation for future trials. Completion
of this study will result in: (1) comprehensive range of customizations grounded in patients lived experience
which will be used to refine one of the first mobile applications for patients with SUD-AD serving as a scalable,
evidence-based adjunctive therapy; (2) provide preliminary data for a post-doctoral NIH grant application testing
this customized mobile application to improve adjunctive therapies for SUD-AD treatment."
10810817,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The developmental origins of obesity begin in utero with growth and differentiation of adipose tissue. Fetal
white adipose tissue accretion is highly variable and dependent on the maternal intrauterine environment.
Unlike white adipose tissue, brown adipose tissue (BAT) has a high capacity for thermogenesis. BAT is
present at birth and it is believed to support the critical function of thermoregulation in early postnatal life.
Therefore, BAT may also influence the development of neonatal energy balance. Similar to white adipose
tissue, it is hypothesized that development of BAT in utero is also influenced by maternal factors such
as prepregnancy BMI and gestational weight gain. The overall research aims of this mentored F32
fellowship are to 1) identify maternal and neonatal factors that contribute to neonatal BAT and 2) to identify
changes in neonatal BAT and to energy expenditure in response to a mild cold exposure. These aims will be
accomplished by leveraging the NIH funded clinical trial of Dr. Leanne Redman (primary mentor) Healthy
Mamas (R01DK124806). The long-term goal of the candidate is to develop an independent research program
that focuses on the developmental origins of energy balance. To achieve this goal, the primary training
objectives are to: 1) develop skills in clinical trial management and data collection for neonates and
grantsmanship, 2) acquire theoretical and practical expertise in brown adipose tissue identification (anatomy)
and activation (physiology) methodology, and, 3) acquire didactic and hands-on training in the physiology,
clinical assessment, and interpretation of human energy expenditure. The research and training will take place
at Pennington Biomedical Research Center, an exceptional research environment that offers endless
opportunities and will be sponsored by world leaders in the field of energy balance: Drs. Leanne Redman
(maternal energy balance), Eric Ravussin (energy expenditure), and Denis Blondin (BAT). Successful
completion of this proposal will result in several first-authored publications and will generate a wealth of
preliminary data for a competitive K01 application. This F32 proposal will not only serve as a valuable training
opportunity to incorporate a balance of didactic, hands-on, and mentor directed learning, but also a novel and
meaningful scientific contribution. This proposed fellowship provides the candidate with the opportunity to
begin training as a developmental energy balance researcher and to launch an independent academic career."
10810818,"Project Summary
 The immune system plays a critical role in maintaining a child’s health, and immune
deficits may have serious consequences ranging from increased susceptibility to infections to
allergic and autoimmune conditions. Although many factors contribute to overall immune health,
emerging data suggest that early life environmental exposures interfere with immune
development and function. Identifying modifiable environmental factors that affect children’s
immunity, our overarching goal is critical to reducing infant morbidity and mortality and has long-
term implications for improving health.
 Semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs), including organophosphate esters,
phthalates, pesticides, and flame retardants, are used in consumer and personal care products,
electronics, furniture, and building materials. As a result of their extensive use and environmental
persistence, SVOCs are detected with high frequency in indoor environments, and human
exposure to mixtures of SVOCs is widespread. Our proposed research assesses exposure to
SVOC mixtures throughout pregnancy and in infancy. We will investigate individual characteristics
associated with higher levels of exposure and evaluate the potential for adverse health outcomes
among exposed women and their children.
 Animal studies provide compelling evidence that exposure to individual SVOCs impacts
immune function; however, the extent to which these studies extend to human populations is
unclear, particularly because they largely consider exposure to single chemicals, which does not
reflect real-world exposures (i.e., those occurring in mixtures). Our primary objective is to
investigate the impacts of early life exposure to SVOC mixtures on children’s immune function,
and in doing so, to fill a critical gap in the understanding of the impacts of SVOCs. This study will
be the first to evaluate the role of SVOC in altering the protection of the neonate by evaluating
the two most critical aspects of early life immune function: 1) passive transfer of immunity and 2)
the capacity to respond to a novel pathogen-associated antigen. We will capitalize on the
infrastructure of HOPE 1000, an ongoing cohort study with longitudinal collection of SVOC
exposure monitors during each trimester of pregnancy and in early childhood, and the
biospecimen needed to evaluate immune function and pathogen immunity.
 Identifying specific SVOCs or mixtures of SVOCs that affect immunity may provide new
opportunities for interventions at the individual and policy levels. Such data are critically needed
as the use of some SVOCs is predicted to increase in the coming years."
10810819,"Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a major public health problem. The central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA)
functions as a hub of stress and anxiety processing and plays a crucial role in the negative affect associated
with alcohol dependence and abstinence/withdrawal. Rodent studies attribute negative, reinforcement–driven
compulsive behaviors associated with alcohol dependence to an “imbalance” between neurotransmitters in the
brain pro-stress and anti-stress systems. Both corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and norepinephrine (NE)
pro-stress systems are critical in behavioral aspects of addiction, including the anxiogenic effects of drug
withdrawal. We have characterized the cellular mechanisms involved in the actions of alcohol and CRF on
GABA and glutamate signaling, and the neuroadaptations induced by alcohol dependence in CeA of male rats.
In addition, we found that NE, like CRF, strongly modulates CeA GABAergic transmission in naive, alcohol
dependent, and withdrawn male rats, and identified specific adrenergic receptors that mediate these effects.
However, it is unknown whether similar functional alterations occur in female rats. Notably, our preliminary data
identified compelling sex-specific differences showing that CeA GABAergic synapses differ in their sensitivity to
the acute effects of alcohol, CRF, NE and nociceptin/orphanin FQ (nociceptin). Concerning the latter, the
opioid-like peptide nociceptin exerts anti-stress effects by counteracting the function of endogenous CRF in the
brain, and our preliminary data show that nociceptin may also counteract NE functions. Surprisingly, no studies
have examined the effects of these neurotransmitter systems on CeA signaling in a sex-dependent manner.
Capitalizing on these recent preliminary findings, the main objective of this project is to test the hypothesis that
1) adaptive changes in pro-stress (CRF and NE) and anti-stress (nociceptin) systems in the CeA circuits are
differentially and sex-specifically recruited or suppressed through alcohol dependence, and 2) the disrupted
balance between these systems leads to significant dysregulation of CeA activity that contributes to the
negative affect associated with alcohol dependence and abstinence, as well as the sex differences in alcohol
abuse patterns. We propose two specific aims with a multidisciplinary approach using in vitro
electrophysiology, molecular biology, and behavioral studies to provide essential mechanistic data that can
elucidate the cellular basis of the susceptibility of AUD to stress and relapse. A better understanding of the
neuroadaptations shaping the synaptic networks involved in alcohol dependence represents a challenge to
alcohol researchers and will be critical toward identifying new promising avenues for therapeutic purposes to
alleviate AUD."
10808528,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nanoparticle-based therapies have many potential advantages for treating cancer, but there are currently no
clinical biomarkers to predict which patients are most likely to benefit from nanotherapeutics over conventional
anticancer agents. To improve the efficacy of nanoparticles for cancer treatment, I will investigate nanoparticle
drug delivery in the context of SLC46A3, a liposome-specific biomarker recently identified in a massively parallel
pooled cancer cell line screen. Based on strong preliminary data, I hypothesize that SLC46A3 plays a role in
phospholipid metabolism in cancer cells, making it a therapeutically relevant biomarker for liposomal
nanotherapeutics. This proposal aims to establish the role of SLC46A3 in phospholipid homeostasis and directly
connect SLC46A3 expression to therapeutic liposome delivery in vivo using pediatric neuroblastoma as a model
system. The ultimate goal of the project is to validate SLC46A3 as a clinical biomarker for liposomal nanoparticle
delivery and develop rigorous preclinical data to motivate biomarker-stratified clinical trials for both existing, FDA-
approved liposomes and experimental formulations.

I have assembled an excellent mentoring and advisory committee, consisting of Dr. Matthew Vander Heiden
(MIT), Dr. Angela Koehler (MIT), and Dr. Steven Dubois (DFCI), who will guide my research and training
experiences along with my mentors. With structured mentoring, educational, and scientific plans, I will acquire
the necessary expertise to become a successful independent investigator in translational cancer nanomedicine."

 The purpose of this K01 Mentored Research Scientist Career Development award is to support Dr.
Margaret Gorvine's current trajectory toward independent investigator status—via achieving the study aims

 Jail incarceration rates in the United States have tripled since the 1980s. More than 3,100 jails
nationwide serviced 10.8 million jail admissions in 2018. Jail correctional officers (COs) are responsible for
maintaining security and supervising detainees in facilities that are often low-resourced (e.g. funding, staffing
shortages), are overcrowded, and replete with health risk exposures (e.g. Covid-19). Therefore, COs
experience high levels of stress due to violence and low autonomy. The high risk of adverse mental health
outcomes and health disparities among COs necessitates addressing CO stress management in jail settings.
 The study will use an evidence-based quality improvement (EBQI) method to achieve the first 2 aims
including: 1) identifying barriers and facilitators to implementing a stress management intervention for
correctional officers in a jail setting through formative evaluation (e.g. in-depth qualitative interviews with key
jail stakeholders); 2) developing an implementation strategy package and intervention modifications. Thirdly,
conduct a pilot hybrid type II effectiveness-implementation trial of the stress management intervention for
correctional officers at the jail, measuring implementation outcomes of acceptability, appropriateness,
feasibility, and fidelity of the intervention and the implementation strategy package.
 The training goals of the K01 Mentored Research Scientist Career Development award include: 1)
developing expertise in implementation research methods related to intervention delivery in jails; 2) enhance
skills in community-engaged research with partners within criminal justice settings; 3) learning how to build
community-engaged partnerships in the jail; 4) developing expertise in evidence-based mind-body intervention
delivery and research; and 5) Increase biostatistics expertise to be fully informed for in-depth collaboration with
biostatisticians."
10808651,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease, characterized by progressive loss of memory which
is associated with other cognitive deficits. It is thought to affect about 5.3 million people in the United States and
is currently ranked as the sixth leading cause of death. Major neuropathology observations of postmortem AD
brain include the presence of senile plaques containing primarily β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide aggregates, and tangles
comprising highly phosphorylated τ proteins. The “Aβ hypothesis” proposes that development of AD is driven by
the accumulation and deposition of Aβ peptide aggregates in the brain. The amyloidogenic pathway is a two-
step sequential cleavage, first by the enzyme β-secretase then by γ-secretase, producing the most
amyloidogenic and neurotoxic Aβ42, which is the most prone to aggregation, forming aggregates of insoluble
fibrils in the brain. Because of the neuropharmacological involvement of γ-secretase, γ-secretase has attracted
considerable attention as a therapeutic target for AD. Many γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) and modulators (GSMs)
have been identified in the AD pipeline. To better understand the γ-secretase biology and assist drug discovery
that targets the γ-secretase, tools to image the γ-secretase in AD human brains will be valuable. The goal of
molecular imaging is non-invasive visualization and quantification of molecular entities and correlation to
pathophysiological events. Consequently, positron emission tomography (PET) can be regarded as a key
molecular imaging tool, allowing for the study of the function and neurochemistry of the human brain. Here, the
aim of this research project is to further develop a potent γ-secretase PET probe with appropriate performance
characteristics. The designed analogs of γ-secretase modulator GSM-15606 will be radiolabeled with 11C for
eventual in vivo PET imaging evaluation. The PET imaging results will be critical to provide novel insights of γ-
secretase in AD brains and support the clinical trial of GSMs in AD intervention."
10808756,"Project Summary: Novel Methods for Dynamic MRI of Gastrointestinal Motor Function
Disorders of gastric motor function include gastroparesis, functional dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux
disease, among others and can affect >20% of the U.S. population. There is an urgent need to improve the
diagnosis and understanding of impaired gastrointestinal (GI) function. The dynamics of gastrointestinal
motion are quite complex, for example, stomach emptying is a tightly coordinated and synchronized process
with fundic accommodation, peristaltic and tonic antral contractions, pylorus opening and antral-pyloric
coordination. There are imaging tools that examine general movement of labeled meals from the stomach into
the intestines, but that miss the dynamic processes. Similarly, other tools like electrogastrography are able to
assess the frequency and temporal characteristics of stomach contractions but lack spatial resolution to assess
the coordination of different types of motor events occurring at specific locations along the gut. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) has the potential to provide an unprecedented and detailed visualization of
gastrointestinal motor function, allowing new understanding and diagnosis of the pathophysiology of
gastrointestinal disorders. The overall goal of the project, therefore, is to develop MRI methods for high
spatiotemporal resolution imaging of the gut to improve the diagnosis and assessment of gastrointestinal
disorders. There have been breath-hold MRI studies of motion in the gut, but most have limited resolution or
volume of coverage, giving an incomplete picture of function. The slow frequency of motion of the stomach
and intermittent opening of the pylorus requires longer observation times that precludes the use of breath-hold
imaging. Thus, MRI methods must be fast enough and robust enough to resolve respiratory motion in addition
to motion of the stomach and intestines. High spatial resolution and SNR are required to visualize small
structures and allow for automatic segmentation and accurate quantitation of movement parameters. This
project relies on several novel approaches to the dynamic signal modeling, image acquisition, and image
reconstruction, to achieve new levels of spatiotemporal resolution for this application. The project has three
main aims: (1) Develop four-dimensional spatiotemporal models to capture dynamics due to respiration, gastric
accommodation, motility, emptying and coordination, (2) Design MRI acquisition and reconstruction methods
for high spatiotemporal resolution, free-breathing, dynamic imaging of the stomach and the intestines, and (3)
Evaluate acquisition and reconstruction methods in healthy volunteers. This project has the potential to
substantially advance the state-of-the-art dynamic imaging of gastrointestinal motor function. Importantly,
imaging in the free-breathing state will allow broader application to sicker populations and the methods will
allow for more quantitative and accurate assessment of motion."
10810650,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Rather than the traditional approach of studying the function of one gene in a proposal, our team’s discovery-
based approaches have allowed us to define the functions of many novel genes simultaneously. Our
bioinformatic discovery of novel reproductive tract-enriched genes and definition of their functions in mouse
models provide powerful means to place these gene products into unique biological pathways and gain insight
into the molecular processes of mammalian spermatogenesis. With the support of this R01 grant, we created
knockouts of over 150 novel genes using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering. We prioritized 27
genes that encode secreted, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored, and transmembrane proteins that
are potential contraceptive targets and/or act in spermiogenesis or for sperm maturation or function; knockouts
of 17 of these 27 genes resulted in fertility defects. These classes of genes were chosen because of their
potential relevance to infertility in men and their likelihood as targets for male contraception; ~70% of FDA-
approved drugs target either membrane-bound or secreted proteins, and thus these proteins could be targets
for antibody-based or small molecule contraceptives. To date, these R01 studies have resulted in 38 papers,
including 9 papers in Science, PNAS, and PLoS Genetics. In this R01 grant renewal proposal, we will continue
to utilize our combined expertise in informatics, biochemistry, molecular biology, chemical biology, and
manipulation of the mouse genome. The overall goals of this grant renewal are to mechanistically define the in
vivo functions of six novel male reproductive tract-essential proteins that are required for sperm transit through
the uterotubal junction (UTJ) and to use DNA-Encoded Chemistry Technology (DEC-Tec) to find chemical
entities that can serve as non-hormonal contraceptives. Our hypothesis is that these novel reproductive tract-
specific proteins act in evolutionarily conserved pathways required for sperm function, processes that are
vulnerable to targeting strategies for contraception. Using DEC-Tec, we have already screened multi-billion
compound libraries with contraceptive target proteins in this proposal and identified hits with excellent
structure-enrichment relationships (both predicted specific and pan-inhibitor molecules). Our hypothesis will be
tested in the following Specific Aims: 1) Define the molecular mechanisms of action of five testis-specific
proteins in sperm transit through the UTJ; 2) Determine the functions and functional domains of an epididymis-
specific gene in sperm epididymal maturation and transit through the UTJ; and 3) Use small molecules
identified through DEC-Tec screens to block sperm transit through the UTJ. Our proof-of-principle studies have
important translational implications for human reproductive genetics and contraceptive development: these
essential sperm UTJ transit proteins and interacting pathway proteins are potentially mutated in infertile men
and are promising targets for small molecule contraception, priority areas of the NICHD scientific vision."
10810652,"The goal of this project is to understand the subcortical-hippocampal circuit mechanisms underlying
social memory consolidation and brain state changes. The hippocampal mechanisms underlying spatial memory
involve the reactivation of cells (active in the learning phase) during sharp-wave ripples (SWRs). However, it is
not yet well known how these mechanisms extend to other types of declarative memory, such as social memory.
Previously, I showed that the CA2 region can generate SWRs. In addition, CA2 has been reported to play a role
in social behaviors. In the K99 of this award, I will study the underlying mechanisms of social memory. I will use
large-scale electrophysiology and online optogenetic manipulations in different transgenic mouse lines.
 In addition to the hippocampus, the median raphe nuclei (MnR), which sends anatomical projections to
CA2, has been also related to social behaviors. The MnR is one of the sources of serotonin production in the
brain, which has been related to social and mood disorders both in rodents and humans. Furthermore, it was
recently shown that MnR activity modulate hippocampal SWRs. During the R00 part of this award, I will
investigate the role of the MnR-CA2 circuit in social memory. In order to address this, I will combine modern
anatomical techniques, simultaneous electrophysiological recordings of MnR-hippocampus and simultaneous
electrophysiological recordings and fiber photometry measurements to monitor the serotonergic tone from MnR.
 Finally, my previous work and others showed that CA2 activity correlates with hippocampal network
transitions, such as SWRs states and running-immobility states. This suggests that CA2 might play a role in
general brain state transitions. Interestingly, the MnR has also been reported to have a role in state transitions
during waking and sleep. During the R00 phase, I will investigate the role of MnR-CA2 in gating global brain
state transitions. I will use simultaneous electrophysiology from both regions combined with wide stimulation of
MnR terminals in CA2. Furthermore, by using micro-LED embedded silicon based electrodes in specific
transgenic animals, I will precisely dissect the contribution of the different MnR cells to each state transition.
 In summary, this proposal aims to understand the subcortical-hippocampal interactions underlying social
memory and in general, brain state network dynamics. I will apply state of the art electrophysiological recordings,
selective manipulation techniques and calcium signal recordings. The conclusions that I will be to extract from
this project will shed light into our current basic understanding of neuropsychiatric diseases and mood disorders.
 The new technical skills that I will be able to acquire during the training period of this grant will be crucial
in order to settle the basis of the research program of my independent laboratory studying subcortical-
hippocampal interactions. In addition, the complementary skills that I will gain by training in writing, project
managing and leadership, together with the guidance from my mentoring team and the diverse environments of
Columbia University and NYU, will entitle me with the proper scientific skills to launch my independent career."
10810655,"ABSTRACT
 The central goal of this R01 proposal is to understand how molecular and cellular interactions of heparan
sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) modulate the pathogenesis of acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury
(AILI). Accidental or intentional misuse of APAP is the leading cause of acute liver failure in the Western world.
While mechanisms that trigger AILI are well known, those that facilitate liver recovery are less understood.
HSPGs bind and regulate various tissue injury factors through their heparan sulfate (HS) chains, but the
significance and mechanisms of HSPGs in tissue injury and repair in vivo remain largely unknown. We
examined the role of syndecan-1 (Sdc1), the major cell surface HSPG of hepatocytes, in AILI. Deletion of Sdc1
in mice led to unopposed progression of liver injury in APAP liver disease. However, direct APAP hepatoxicity
at early times after APAP overdose was unaffected by Sdc1 deletion, suggesting that Sdc1 regulates later
mechanisms that affect the progression and outcome of APAP liver disease. The exuberant AILI phenotypes of
Sdc1 null (Sdc1-/-) mice were traced to an exaggerated innate immune response in the liver and a deficiency
in pro-survival Akt signaling in hepatocytes and hepatocyte proliferation, which led to amplification of liver
damage. Administration of purified Sdc1 or heparan compounds containing 2-O-sulfate motifs rescued Sdc1-/-
mice from AILI by inhibiting innate immune responses, and by potentiating hepatocyte proliferation and liver
repair. Furthermore, HS showed a significantly prolonged therapeutic efficacy as compared to N-acetylcysteine
(NAC), the clinical antidote for APAP overdose. These findings suggest that Sdc1 and HS, either alone or in
combination with NAC, could provide a new therapeutic strategy to combat AILI, especially in treating patients
admitted after NAC treatment is no longer effective. Based on these preliminary data, we propose that Sdc1 is
a critical endogenous factor that halts the perpetuation of liver injury and facilitates liver repair in AILI. This
hypothesis will be tested in 3 specific aims. Aim 1 will define how Sdc1 is released from hepatocytes during
AILI and establish that discrete structural motifs in Sdc1 HS provide protection against AILI. Aim 2 will
elucidate the biological mechanisms of how Sdc1 halts the progression of AILI. Aim 3 will determine how Sdc1
enhances hepatocyte proliferation and facilitates liver repair in AILI. These studies are expected to establish a
new integrated pathway in liver injury and repair."

The public health burden of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is enormous, affecting ~350,000 individuals
each year in the U.S. and is the third leading cause of death. To improve our understanding of OHCA, the
Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES) was launched by Emory University and the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. Through >70 peer-reviewed publications over the past 2 decades, CARES
has transformed our understanding of the epidemiology and outcomes of patients with OHCA. Yet, little is
known as to how some emergency medical service (EMS) agencies achieve higher survival rates for their
patients with OHCA than other agencies. While variation in OHCA survival is largely believed to be due to
adoption of key care processes by EMS agencies in the prehospital setting, how these processes are
employed in routine practice, the underlying factors contributing to their successful implementation, and
effective interactions between EMS agencies with the community, first responders (e.g., police, fire), 911
dispatchers, and hospitals have not been systematically defined. Moreover, despite the fact that Black and
Hispanic patients have lower survival rates for OHCA than White patients, there is scant research on how to
reduce disparities in OHCA survival and how top-performing EMS agencies that work in majority Black or
Hispanic communities overcome additional barriers to prehospital OHCA response and care.
Accordingly, we propose the RED-CASO (Reducing Ethnic-racial Disparities in Cardiac Arrest Survival
Outcomes) study to address these critical gaps in knowledge and to lay the foundation for quality improvement
efforts to reduce disparities in OHCA survival. First, we will identify top-performing and bottom-performing EMS
agencies in OHCA survival, with a focus on those that work in majority Black or Hispanic communities.
Second, we will identify ‘best practices’ at top-performing EMS agencies in OHCA survival through detailed
interviews with key stakeholders during site visits. We will intentionally sample EMS agencies which work in
majority Black or Hispanic communities, and these agencies will comprise at least half of the sites visited. And
third, we will validate these best practices associated with EMS agencies with the highest survival rates for
OHCA. We will use a sequential mixed-methods approach with a focus on identifying best practices at top-
performing EMS agencies which work in communities where most residents are Black or Hispanic. We will
build on work by our investigative team to systematically understand factors associated with survival for other
emergency settings (in-hospital cardiac arrest) and leverage our team’s multidisciplinary expertise in
cardiology, emergency medicine, epidemiology, and mixed methods research. Findings from this study will be
used to construct a ‘best practices guide’ for OHCA that can be implemented by EMS agencies both within
CARES and with national partners such as the American Heart Association to improve OHCA survival in
predominantly non-White communities and, in turn, reduce racial and ethnic disparities in OHCA outcomes."

Talaromycosis is an invasive mycosis caused by a dimorphic fungus Talaromyces marneffei that is endemic in
Southeast Asia. Infection kills one in three infected people with a compromised immune system. Despite the
high morbidity and mortality in a region encompassing half of the world population, fundamental knowledge of
disease burden and reservoir are lacking. Current diagnosis relies on decade-old culture methods which lacks
sensitivity and takes 14 days for identification, leading to treatment delays and higher mortality. Over the last
decade our talaromycosis research program in Vietnam has made landmark contributions to our knowledge of
epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment. We have established an extensive network of collaborators in Vietnam
and in Southeast Asia and have a pipeline of novel non-culture diagnostics to advance diagnostic modalities and
knowledge of disease reservoir and transmission to humans. We believe we are in the best position to lead a
Tropical Medicine Research Center in Talaromycosis through an integrated program of research and capacity
development. We propose the following specific aims:
AIM 1. To determine the diagnostic accuracy of a real-time PCR assay and 4 novel antigen detection
assays in late stage of development for rapid diagnosis of talaromycosis. Here we will leverage whole
blood, sera, urine samples collected from an ongoing NIH-funded talaromycosis cohort (35HN, N=1,400) to
compare diagnostic performance of 5 non-culture assays for rapid diagnosis.
AIM 2. To determine the differential host transcriptomic signatures that differentiate talaromycosis from
other opportunistic infections. Here we will leverage whole blood samples collected in PAXgene tubes from
the 35HN talaromycosis cohort to identify transcriptional signatures that differentiate talaromycosis from other
oportunistic infections. Our goal is to identify a gene set unique to talaromycosis that can be developed into a
point-of-care diagnostic test.
AIM 3. To determine the epidemiological link between human disease and airborne exposure and the
potential for Tm to cause a primary pulmonary infection in humans. Here, we will conduct an integrated
community-based seroprevalence and air sampling study and compare the burden of Tm isolated from the air
and Tm IgG in the blood of 300 adults living in high-risk highland provinces and 300 adults living in low-risk
lowland provinces. In each geographic group, we will recruit 150 adults with and 150 without respiratory
symptoms to determine the potential for Tm to cause a primary pulmonary infection by testing for Tm IgM and
IgG levels at enrolment and at time of seroconversion.
Impact statement. These studies aim to validate multiple non-culture diagnostics for talaromycosis and develop
pathways for their clinical and public health applications. The community-based seroprevalence and air sampling
studies have the potential to advance our understanding of disease reservoir and airborne transmission to
humans. This knowledge will inform disease control at the individual and the population levels."
10810786,"The primary challenge in curing HIV-1 is the persistence of a latent viral reservoir (LVR) in resting CD4+ (rCD4)
T cells that harbor stably integrated latent HIV. Examining changes in the LVR composition is incredibly difficult
due to the long half-life. Recent data show that clonal expansion of latently infected rCD4 T cells through a
combination of antigenic stimulation, homeostatic proliferation, and integration site promotor disruption are
major contributors to LVR maintenance. It is unclear which tissue source is the primary driver of LVR
maintenance, as well as what level of contribution each of these three potential mechanisms driving proliferation
may play in that process. Solid organ transplantation in people living with HIV and the associated different T
cell induction strategies prescribed for prophylactic allograft rejection treatment provide a unique opportunity to
examine how the LVR rebounds after a large proportion of the T cell repertoire is destroyed. The HOPE in
Action HIV+ kidney organ transplantation trial provides access to >120 matched flash frozen lymph nodes (LN),
renal allograft tissue, and longitudinally collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from PLWH. We
hypothesize that the LVR is primarily maintained through antigen stimulation of latently infected cells in micro
foci within lymph nodes, which subsequently migrate into the circulation and other tissues in the body, thereby
reestablishing the LVR post-T cell depletion therapy.
Aim 1: Examine long-term LVR dynamics post-renal transplantation and its association with clinical outcomes.
We will measure the HIV LVR annually for up to 10 years using the intact proviral DNA assay (IPDA), which
distinguishes fully intact HIV from defective, deleted, and hypermutated proviral DNA, in individuals receiving
transplant-related immunosuppressive drugs that are of interest to HIV cure strategies. Aim 2: Develop a tissue
specific atlas of the LVR in LN, blood, and organ tissue (kidney) pre-transplantation, and examine reseeding of
the circulating, LN, and kidney allograft LVR post T cell induction. We will assemble a multi-modal atlas of HIV+
LN by integrating the CODEX multiplexed immunofluorescence (mIF) platform to phenotype lymphoid cells and
laser capture microdissection (LCM) and site-directed next-generation sequencing of the proviruses in cells
isolated from distinct LN zones. HIV SMRTcap, a novel HIV-specific single molecule sequencing assay will
provide simultaneous resolution of proviral sequences and matched integration sites, to evaluate clonality and
intactness of latent provirus within the LN, PBMC and kidney. Aim 3: Determine the relative contribution of
homeostatic proliferation, antigenic stimulation, and integration site promoter disruption on LVR maintenance
and re-establishment post-transplant.
These proposed studies will enable us to characterize the longitudinal LVR spatially, genetically, and
phenotypically in multiple compartments. This project will provide critical information on feasibility and
mechanisms of potential HIV cure strategies by modeling re-seeding of viral populations in kidney allograft and
lymphoid tissues and determining driving mechanisms of clonal proliferation."

The brain is a highly inter-connected network system, with distributed brain regions orchestrating to maintain
normal brain function and mediate complex behavior. It is becoming increasingly clear that altered brain network
properties underlie mental illness, but the neural substrates causing these large-scale network changes
remain unknown. A key hypothesis is the dysfunction of brain hub regions. Hubs are brain regions that have
high degrees of connections with the rest of the brain network. Because of their central roles, dysfunction of hub
nodes can change global integrative process, and has been hypothesized to be a direct cause of altered brain
network function and pathophysiology of brain disorders. However, directly testing this hypothesis in humans is
challenging, as selectively manipulating activity in a hub and dissecting its causal impact on brain networks is
difficult. We will bridge this critical gap using cutting-edge tools to manipulate the activity of a hub, and monitor
the impact of these manipulations on brain networks using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging
(rsfMRI) and behavior in an awake rat model. In the current grant cycle we have established the rsfMRI approach
in awake rats, which allows us to reliably measure resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) and characterize
brain network properties in rats. We have built on our awake rat rsfMRI approach by incorporating Designer
Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs), optogenetics, electrophysiology and animal
behaviors. With these capacities, we can causally manipulate the activity in a hub brain region, and measure the
corresponding brain-wide network reconfigurations. Using optogenetics, we can manipulate neural activity on
the millisecond timescale, and using DREADDs, we can manipulate neural activity on the times scales of hours
to days. Finally, concurrent electrophysiology-fMRI will allow us to directly relate brain network and behavioral
changes to their neural basis. Our goal is to elucidate the causal impact of manipulating hub region activity on
brain network organization, function and behavior in awake rats using rsfMRI, DREADDs, optogenetics and
electrophysiology. In Aim 1, we will document changes in network properties including the network topological
organization and brain-wide RSFC dynamics induced by semi-acute suppression of a brain hub. With the cell-
type specificity of DREADDs, we will examine the role of the balance of excitation and inhibition in a hub in brain
network dynamics. To elucidate the relationship between activity of a network node and specific brain network
function, in Aim 2 we will dissect the functional role of each node in the default mode network and related
behaviors in rats. In Aim 3, we will further determine the impact of chronic suppression of a hub on long-term
network reorganization and behavior. Successful completion of the proposed research will elucidate the causal
relationship between short-term and long-term dysfunction of a hub and brain network reconfigurations, which
will help understand the neural substrates causing large-scale brain network changes."

While the behavioral heterogeneity of stuttering has been long recognized, very little is known about
mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity. Without this knowledge, the complex etiology of stuttering cannot
be fully understood, and the development of individualized treatment approaches will continue to be severely
hindered. Our long-term goal is to develop neuroscience-based treatment approaches for developmental
stuttering. In pursuit of this goal, the objective of the present application is to identify subtypes of children who
stutter (CWS) based on neuroanatomical anomalies and characterize each subtype’s behavioral profiles and
brain activity during speech production. The central hypothesis is that each neural subtype is associated with
behavioral and brain activity changes consistent with its primary neuroanatomical anomalies. The rationale of
this proposed project is that elucidating the neural subtypes of stuttering will help us understand the
heterogeneity and neurological etiologies of the disorder, which is an important basis for developing new
treatment approaches that target individual neurological deficits. We will test our central hypothesis by
pursuing three specific aims. i) Identify subtypes of CWS based upon patterns of neuroanatomical anomalies.
To achieve this aim, we will use a clustering method to analyze gray matter volume patterns in CWS. We
hypothesize that CWS comprise neural subtypes, characterized by primary structural anomalies in the
prefrontal areas, the basal ganglia thalamocortical circuit and the cerebellum. ii) Characterize behavioral
profiles associated with each neural subtype. Based on contemporary models of speech motor control, we
hypothesize that each neural subtype will differ in both stuttering behaviors, language ability, and speech motor
performance depending on the functions of its primary neuroanatomical anomaly loci. iii) Characterize brain
activity associated with speech production in each neural subtype. To achieve this aim, we will identify
differences in brain activity between neural subtypes during overt continuous speech using functional magnetic
resonance imaging. Our working hypothesis is that compared to controls, each neural subtype of CWS will
exhibit reduced activation associated with its primary anatomical anomalies as well as their common input
region, the left premotor areas. Upon successful completion of the proposed research, we expect to gain an
expanded understanding of anatomical neural subtypes of stuttering, and for the first time, link behaviors and
brain activity differences during speech production among the different subtypes. Better characterizing neural
subtypes of stuttering would substantially contribute to our understanding of the heterogeneity of stuttering,
which is an important step in elucidating the disorder’s complex etiology."
10813890,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the United States.
Research has shown that there is chronic neuroinflammation following TBI, which contributes to progressive
neurodegeneration, white matter loss and cognitive decline. Unfortunately, the pathological processes
underlying chronic neuroinflammation are poorly understood. The overall objective of the current study is to
elucidate the mechanisms that underlie chronic neuroinflammation after TBI and test therapeutic
interventions that target these mechanisms. Our central hypothesis is that newly discovered
proinflammatory and neurotoxic A1 astrocytes play a key role in chronic neuroinflammation, progressive
neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline long-term after TBI. A1 astrocytes are astrocytes that lose the
ability to carry out their normal functions, produce complement components, are less able to promote the
formation of new synapses, and release factors which can damage or kill neurons and oligodendrocytes [9].
Furthermore, our preliminary data indicates that A1 astrocytes express “senescent” markers and are
senescent, raising the possibility that senolytic drugs could be used to ablate A1 astrocytes as a potential
therapy in TBI. The following specific aims are proposed to test our hypothesis. Aim 1 would characterize
the induction, underlying mechanisms and role of A1 astrocytes in TBI. This would be achieved by: 1a.
Characterizing A1/A2 astrocyte induction and astrocyte transcriptome changes in the brain after TBI. 1b.
Determining the role of microglia in A1 astrocyte induction in the brain after TBI. 1c. Determining neurotoxic
ability of A1 astrocytes isolated from the brain after TBI. 1d. Establishing whether A1 astrocytes have a
critical role in long-term neuropathology and functional outcome following TBI. Aim 2 would determine the
therapeutic efficacy of targeting senescent A1 astrocytes and microglia as a potential therapy for TBI. This
would be achieved by: 2a. Determining the therapeutic efficacy of senolytic drugs to ablate senescent A1
astrocytes and senescent microglia and reduce neuropathology and functional deficits long-term after TBI.
2b. Establishing the therapeutic window for senolytic drug treatment in TBI. 2c. Determining the duration of
beneficial effects for senolytic drugs in TBI. The proposed research is highly innovative conceptually in
proposing a critical role of recently identified A1 astrocytes and senescent cells in TBI pathology and chronic
neuroinflammation. It is also highly innovative technically in the proposed use of a novel triple-knockout
mouse model of the three A1-inducing factors, RNA-seq for glial cell transcriptome profiling, and the
proposed use of recently identified senolytics as potential therapies to improve long-term outcome in TBI. If
successful, the studies would have high impact on the field as they could provide hope of a therapy that
could be used months or even years after TBI, where there is now no treatment options other than supportive
care."
10813843,"Project Summary
Maternal care of offspring requires rapid neurobehavioral changes, including plasticity within circuits specialized
for processing infant cues such as crying. Neuroendocrine signals are important for neuroplasticity, including
release of the peptide hormone oxytocin. Oxytocin is released from the hypothalamus and is important for
childbirth and lactation. Oxytocin also acts in the brain where it is believed to increase the salience of social
information, enhancing pair bonding and maternal behavior. Clinical studies suggest that oxytocin is a promising
therapeutic agent, with patients sometimes engaging more successfully in social interactions. Although there is
a high rate of child maltreatment and neglect, training programs and interventions that teach parents to detect
and respond to social signals have had some success. These therapies would benefit from understanding how
observing, learning, and teaching behaviors required for childcare involve various neural circuits and processes,
including how the central oxytocin system might be involved in neuroplasticity relevant for maternal behaviors.
 In this proposal, we will study the neural circuitry, plasticity, and behavioral effects of oxytocin in the
context of maternal behavior and learned alloparenting in mice. We study neurobehavioral responses to infant
ultrasonic vocalizations by maternal caregivers, which requires experience with pups and is facilitated by
oxytocin. We will study behavioral interactions between experienced mother mice (‘dams’) and virgin females
put in the homecage with dam and pups. The central hypothesis is that dams change their behavior in the
presence of the virgin, recruiting them to be co-carers via behaviors that increase virgin oxytocin signaling to
promote alloparenting. We will use in vivo recordings and optogenetics in behaving animals, combined with
studies of neural circuits providing sensory input to hypothalamic oxytocin neurons. In Aim 1 we monitor and
manipulate oxytocin signaling as virgins watch movies of dams being maternal. In Aim 2, we study how visual
input and other sensory signals are routed to oxytocin neurons. Finally in Aim 3 we ask if oxytocin neurons in
dams are important for changes in dam behavior to help transmit maternal behaviors or train virgins to be
alloparents.
 In summary, here we will use behavioral experiments combined with optogenetics and in vivo recordings
to ask how oxytocin is released to enable maternal recognition of infant distress calls. These experiments will
provide fundamental and urgently-needed data on the neural circuitry and functional consequences of oxytocin
signaling in the mammalian brain, in the context of a deep and long-standing question in neuroscience: how are
specific neural circuits specialized for sensory processing and maternal behavior?"

Whereas a large body of mechanosensation knowledge exists, synergy between our current understanding of
sensory mechanotransduction and Force-Based Manipulations (FBM) mechanisms across research disciplines
remains severely limited. This lack of synergy between these research fields has proven to be a formidable
barrier to the advancement and therapeutic optimization of FBM. To accelerate interdisciplinary collaborative
research and advance the FBM field, we aim to establish a national/international academic and professional
Force-Based Manipulation network (ForceNet). The charge of ForceNet will be to successfully overcome the
long-established barriers pertaining to: 1) the lack of universal FBM force-related metrics, 2) the lack of FBM
mechanistic knowledge (including how mechanosensitive receptors, neurons, and circuits change in pathological
conditions), and 3) the undefined but potentially important role of contextual factors on FBM mechanisms. To
accomplish our Network goals, we will stimulate interdisciplinary research at the intersections of physiology,
biomechanics, big data/artificial intelligence, neuroscience, immunology, imaging and psychology emphasizing
clinical and translationally relevant research addressing FBM metrics of applied force, neural mechanisms of
FBM mechanotransduction, and FBM contextual effects. ForceNet will emphasize the development of new
interdisciplinary collaborations and the submission of novel experimental and translational pre-clinical pilot
projects. These pilot projects will encompass basic, theoretical framework, and translational designs, primary
and secondary analyses, new and ancillary projects, and will be open to investigators across the entire academic
career spectrum. ForceNet aims to grow and diversify the FBM workforce, develop a pipeline of new FBM
interdisciplinary investigators, and encourage new collaborations between larger research-intensive public
universities and smaller Integrative Medicine institutions. ForceNet will use a variety of avenues to create and
share new FBM knowledge and resources including performing a FBM Delphi Study, publishing 6-10 articles in
a special issue of Journal of Manual and Manipulative Therapy, hosting face-to-face and virtual, workshops,
webinars, creating an interactive website where ForceNet members can locate future interdisciplinary
collaborators, and using social media to promote and share Network resources. Pilot grant awardees will present
their research findings at our annual ForceNet workshops, designed to encourage new interdisciplinary FBM
collaborations. To sustain ForceNet network growth after the funding period ends, we will establish ForceNet
“special interest groups”, satellite events, and social events at large national/international scientific meetings in
which ForceNet members attend regularly and/or serve in a leadership capacity. As current leaders in the field
of basic and clinical FBM research, the resources provided to the ForceNet Leadership Team along with our
highly visible institutions and established personal networks of interdisciplinary collaborators makes our proposal
well positioned to substantially impact FBM mechanistic research and clinical care for decades to come."

The Proteomics & Biophysics Core (Core B) will provide high-quality reagents and services to support all
projects in the program. The reagents include recombinant tau and TREM2 proteins as well as synthetic Aβ
peptides. The Core will also perform comprehensive biophysical measurements on proteins to provide
structural information. Additionally, mass spectrometry-based methods, such as quantitative proteomics,
hydroxyl radical protein footprinting and mass spectrometry imaging, will be utilized to analyze the chemical
composition and spatial distribution of Aβ and tau aggregates in brain sections, as well as conformational
“footprints” of both Aβ and tau prions.
In addition to using standard “best-practice” technologies, we will develop and implement several emerging
techniques that have recently shown great promise by us and others in the field. For example, hydroxyl radical
protein footprinting has been used to study soluble proteins and, more recently, applied to amyloids. This
method will be used to obtain conformational differences among prion strains. Moreover, mass spec imaging
and traditional immunohistochemistry complement each other. When combined, these two methods will
provide more detailed information about the chemical composition and much higher spatial resolutions.
Importantly, Core B will be operated by highly experienced biochemists and biophysical chemists to ensure
highest quality reagents and services."

At present, there is no treatment that prevents or even slows the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD),
which is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder. The Animal Core (Core C) will provide normal and
genetically modified mice or rats and will conduct the experiments described in Projects 1, 2, and 3. Rodent
models that express human proteins involved in neurodegenerative disease proved key in the discovery of
misfolded forms of normal proteins, called prions, as new principles of disease. AD involves two prions, tau
and Abeta. Cellular assays allow measurement of human tau and Abeta prions in culture, but transfer of
disease from humans to mice will provide essential validation. Inoculation of brain homogenates into specific
regions of the rodent brain and subsequent diagnosis of disease requires exceptionally skilled animal
technicians who also assess disease onset by evaluating clinical signs and by bioluminescence as a marker of
disease-induced gliosis in transgenic models specifically bred for this purpose (Projects 1 and 2). The stability
of tau and Abeta prion strains or conformations also will be tested by repeated passage in mice (Project 2).
Exceptionally high resolution structures (Project 3) can be determined by cryo-electron microscopy using
material provided by Core C. The experiments executed in Core C ultimately will provide models to test
therapies that halt disease progression."

This is a competitive renewal of a training program to address the shortage of psychiatrist scientists pursuing
careers in basic and clinical research who are positioned to translate dramatic advances in neuroscience and
genetics into clinically-relevant research on pathophysiology and new treatments for psychiatric disorders. An
increasing number of scientifically accomplished residents have abandoned their scientific career goals feeling
daunted by the increasing funding and regulatory challenges associated with research. Accordingly, the UCSF
Research Resident Training Program (RRTP) is pivoting from its historical pursuit of recruiting residents into
research for the first time. Instead, through proactive mentorship and targeted research support, our revised
RRTP will focus resources on fostering the development of a smaller number of accomplished and diverse
residents specifically recruited because of their strong potential and motivation to pursue scientific careers. The
RRTP begins its research training activities during PGY-1; a research project is developed in the PGY-1 or -2
and conducted in PGY-3-4 and, if indicated, into PGY-5-7. In addition to stipend support, the program provides
funding to support resident research projects, professional travel, and formal course work in methodology,
statistics and research ethics. Each trainee is assigned a career mentor who assists them in creating an
individualized learning and development plan, identifying a research mentor, and providing support and advice
about ongoing issues related to career development. In conjunction with formal coursework and hands-on
research experience, networking and career development opportunities are emphasized, as is the successful
integration of clinical and research training. The career development of women and under-represented minority
trainees is specifically emphasized. Research residents participate in ongoing research-related journal clubs, a
works-in-progress dinner series, as well as an interinstitutional Research Retreat that we will rotate between
northern and southern California sites. In addition to our shift toward direct recruitment of promising and
diverse residents directly into 3 research track slots per year, we will introduce other innovations including: 1)
new diversity initiatives, 2) increased protected time and flexibility in clinical rotations to build research
momentum, 3) developing readiness for a faster transition to independence, 4) developing an entrustable
professional activities feedback tool, 5) broadening dissemination of resources and networking to residents
training outside our department, 6) using continuous process improvement in areas such as recruitment and
retreat programming, 7) further innovations in “near-peer” learning, 8) increased grant writing guidance, and 9)
teaching around team science and leadership. Our program’s success in launching independent scientific
careers will be assessed through subjective and objective instruments constructed to assay changes in
attitudes, knowledge, and skills in the course of their research training; entry into research fellowships and
career positions; and subsequent record of research productivity: publications, citations, grants and awards."

The Human Immune Monitoring Center (HIMC) has been a comprehensive resource for immunological assays
at Stanford for fifteen years. The HIMC Core will leverage this facility and its robust infrastructure to provide
biobanking, assays, and data organization services to the CCHI projects. Coordinating with the Clinical Core,
blood samples will be processed for PBMC, serum, RNA, and DNA, and biobanked according to optimized and
standardized procedures. Together with the existing inventory of many thousands of specimens from previous
CCHI and HIPC studies, these samples will be distributed to CCHI projects as needed, using an existing online
portal to request specific samples, with approval from an oversight committee. State-of-the-art, standardized
immune assays will also be applied to the CCHI samples, including CyTOF mass cytometry, multiplexed Luminex
and Olink cytokine analysis, hemagglutinin inhibition, phospho-flow cytometry, and whole blood RNAseq, to
provide comprehensive immunological data. As required for specific CCHI projects, custom Luminex panels and
single-cell multi-omics assays (BD Rhapsody, Mission Bio Tapestri, Parse Evercode, and/or Fluent PIPseq) will
be performed. Finally, the HIMC Core will integrate data from all standard HIMC assays with clinical and
demographic metadata using the online database, Stanford Data Miner (SDM). Existing scripts will then allow
formatting of data from SDM into ImmPort templates for samples, persons, and assay results.
The HIMC Core will create a valuable database of clinical specimens and comprehensive immunological data,
that will not only serve the needs of the CCHI U19 projects, but many other projects for years to come."
10824441,"Autophagy is a cellular homeostasis pathway that has been implicated in numerous diseases. One of these
diseases, Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC), is an autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative disorder.
Mutations in the NPC1 gene occur in 95% of patients, and the resultant NPC1 protein is misfolded and degraded
or no longer capable of facilitating intracellular trafficking of lipids and cholesterol through the lysosome. There
is currently no FDA-approved therapy for NPC, and thus there is a critical need to develop effective therapeutics
to meet the needs of NPC patients. The long-term goal of this research is to address this need through the
development of small-molecule autophagy modulators that restore lipid homeostasis in vivo. The overall
objective of this proposal is to identify and optimize small molecules that modulate autophagy, improve the NPC
phenotype in vitro, and restore lipid homeostasis in vivo while also extending life span. The rationale for this
research is that various mechanisms of autophagy modulation, including early-stage inhibition, late-stage
inhibition, and activation, have been reported to have potential therapeutic benefit in models of NPC. The central
hypothesis of this research is that small molecules that modulate autophagy will alleviate cholesterol
accumulation and extend life span of NPC mice. However, it is still unclear what mechanism of autophagy
modulation is most beneficial, and this question will be a central focus of this research through unbiased
identification of autophagy modulators that improve the NPC phenotype. This approach is innovative because it
departs from the status quo of developing autophagy modulators and then exploring their effects in NPC and
instead uses phenotypic screens to identify modulators that have a positive impact on NPC phenotypes with
subsequent determination of the mechanism of autophagy modulation. Mass spectrometry imaging will be used
as a novel method to determine modulator mechanism and to evaluate efficacy of autophagy modulators in vivo
through the analysis of protein and lipid changes, which will also aid in the identification of biomarkers. The
proposed research is significant because it will identify which mechanism of autophagy modulation is most
beneficial in NPC, it will provide novel, small-molecule autophagy modulators with efficacy in NPC, and it will
provide new strategies for the assessment of small-molecule mechanism in vivo without labeled probes. These
advances will greatly contribute to the long-term goal of bringing new therapeutic options to NPC patients."
10825316,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Human respiratory viruses not only contribute to substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide but also pose
a massive pandemic threat. This broad range of viruses includes human coronavirus (hCoVs), influenza A,
and human metapneumoviruses (HMPV). Vaccines are among the most powerful means for mitigating viral
epidemics but require significant neutralizing antibody breadth to maximize the probability of effectiveness
against unknown viral threats. While a number of components of a protective immune response could be
targeted to form the basis of a broadly protective coronavirus vaccine, neutralizing antibodies are generally
accepted to be a key component of protective immunity. Although development of effective first-generation
SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that induced protective antibody responses against severe illness has proceeded
with unprecedented speed and seasonal influenza A (IAV) vaccines continue to offer protection, their
effectiveness against emergent seasonal variants (e.g., Omicron) and, importantly, against other potential
zoonotic viruses is less likely. Indeed, risk of zoonotic spillover events of divergent CoVs, such as the
recently documented cases of human transmission from a canine alpha-CoV and a porcine delta-CoV that
led to flu-like symptoms in infected Haitian children, highlights the need for innovative approaches to identify
countermeasures targeting highly-conserved sites on CoV spikes shared among the Orthocoronavirinae
subfamily. Project 2 will prioritize the development of immunogens that elicit neutralizing antibodies
that can be measured in vitro. We will synergize with other Project members to test as many
immunization strategies as possible in human organoid models, where the multifaceted functions of
antibodies, effector cells, and host factors can be used to inhibit viral replication in an exposed host.
Specifically, this proposal will focus on three interrelated aims: 1) identify the structural correlates of broad
and potent antibody neutralization against conserved viral epitopes in CoV-S and IAV-HA trimers, 2) design
multivalent immunogens that stimulate cross-reactive immune responses in human organoid model systems,
and 3) provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of feedback inhibition and immune imprinting that
limit diversification of B cell responses. Overall, this proposal will employ immunology, bioinformatics,
structural biology, protein engineering and immune system models to discover how to elicit antibodies
capable of neutralizing a broad range of emerging pandemic threat RNA viruses. The results will inform our
understanding of broadly-protective anti-CoV and anti-lAV immunity in recovered and vaccinated individuals
and will inform ongoing and future vaccine efforts."

In Project 3, we propose to develop a next-generation of hybrid experimental framework that overcomes the
limitations of single-cohort studies by leveraging heterogeneity between datasets andaccelerates in vitro
hypothesis testing through human organoids (in collaboration with the Technical Project). In building this hybrid
framework, we will develop novel computational methods to predict which genes in which cell types should be
knocked out (or knocked in) and what downstream genes and pathways will change as a result. We will
demonstrate the successful development of this hybrid framework by identifying the mechanisms underlying the
transcriptome signatures we have identified for predicting vaccine response to influenza and predicting the risk
of severe outcome in patients with viral infection. In collaboration with Project 1 and 2, we will identify how
different antibodies relate to protective and detrimental host responses to viral infections and vaccinations. To
achieve these goals, we will create the largest bulk and single-cell transcriptome database of viral infections and
vaccinations to date, which we estimate will include >20,000 bulk transcriptome profiles from ~100 cohorts and
>10,000,000 single-cell RNA-seq profiles from ~2,000 samples. We will perform systems immunology analysis
using the advanced statistical and machine learning methods and computational frameworks developed in the
Khatri lab applied to these large amounts of bulk and single-cell transcriptome data. These computational
frameworks will leverage biological, clinical, and technical heterogeneity in these data to identify and refine
immune signatures (genes, proteins, cell types). Because this process typically identifies hundreds or thousands
of genes, we will apply several methods we have developed to reduce this list of genes, including greedy forward
search. We will also use statistical deconvolution and disease trajectory inference to reduce the number of genes,
while still be able to identify underlying pathways, cell types, and mechanisms. Finally, we will employ systematic
ablation-based methods to infer directional interactions between genes in immune cell types in which they occur.
Using these inferred directed associations, we will pose hypotheses that will be investigated using organoids in
collaboration with Dr. Satpathy and the Technical Project. We will derive a pan-virus conserved host response
gene signature and perform a similar analysis for vaccination, obesity, and diabetes datasets to derive respective
gene signature. We will confirm the immune cell types that preferentially express these genes and understand
whether a change in transcriptome or a change in cell proportion or both lead to observed signatures. We will
identify overlapping immune signatures between infection, vaccination, obesity, and diabetes, which will further
identify detrimental and protective host responses associated with increased or decreased risk of severe
outcome. We will also identify host responses associated with vaccination (e.g., antibody titers, T cell responses)."

High-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOC) account for 75% of ovarian cancer diagnoses, and about 80%
of patients have metastatic disease upon diagnosis. Metastatic HGSOC is typically treated by radical surgical
debulking and cytotoxic chemotherapy, but ~80% of patients’ disease will recur within 3 years, leading to a
median overall survival of only 40 months. Targeted therapies have demonstrated only marginal improvements
in outcomes for HGSOC, and new therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Image-guided targeted alpha-
particle therapy (alpha-TRT) has emerged as an effective intervention for several cancers, and the
commercialization of an alpha-TRT for metastatic HGSOC is significant because success in our efforts will
improve outcomes for the thousands of patients that do not benefit from or relapse after frontline therapies.
The overall goal of this proposal is to commercialize a new alpha-TRT that can improve outcomes for the
thousands of metastatic HGSOC patients for whom all other therapies fall short. To achieve this goal we will
combine Perspective Therapeutics’ proprietary radionuclide chelation and 212Pb isotope production
technologies with an innovative cucurbit[7]uril-adamantane (CB7-Adma) “host:guest pretargeting” platform to
deliver an image-guided alpha-TRT therapeutic using elementally-matched radionuclides 203Pb (imaging) and
212Pb (therapy). This therapeutic approach will target tumor associated glycoprotein 72 (TAG72), a well-
established biomarker that is overexpressed in the majority of HGSOC tumors.
In Phase 1 of this Fast Track STTR project, we will demonstrate the feasibility of the pretargeting approach to
alpha-TRT using a humanized TAG72 monoclonal antibody (huCC49) in mouse models of HGSOC,
demonstrating that the dosimetry-derived therapeutic index meets recognized benchmarks for effective TRT.
Additionally, we will validate huCC49 for this indication by performing immunohistochemistry (IHC) on human
HGSOC samples. In Phase 2, we will optimize our pretargeted alpha-TRT in mice, determining the dose-
dependent tumor growth inhibition, survival, and potential toxicities of the approach. Simultaneously, we will
optimize 212Pb radioligand synthesis and formulation to establish the optimal formulation (and shelf life) for
distribution to clinical sites and CMC preparation. Furthermore, we will synthesize, purify, and characterize
sufficient material to perform GLP toxicology of the “cold” small molecule radioligand according to FDA guidance.
In sum, we will have optimized a protocol for producing and delivering image-guided dosimetry-based
pretargeted alpha-TRT in mice that forms a rigorous basis for human HGSOC therapy. Thus, with success in
our STTR project Aims, Perspective will be prepared for FDA filings (CMC/IND) to support a Phase I clinical trial
that will be financed using private capital as the company has done for previous programs."
10820351,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Understanding sensory processing in the brain has been difficult due to the complex and variable nature of
neuronal activity. The primary goal of this training proposal is to determine how visual encoding is modulated
by fluctuating brain-wide activity. The primary visual cortex (V1) is thought of as the key locus of visual
processing. Recent evidence suggests that visual information exists even outside of the traditional visual
pathway. Additionally, sensory encoding in V1 is modulated by externally measured behavioral state and
locomotion. It remains unclear how these variables are reflected in neuronal computations and to what degree
they modulate visual processing and behavior. We hypothesize that trial-to-trial variability in V1 reflects the
fluctuating activity of a distributed network of brain regions.
In Aim 1, I will use Neuropixels 2.0 recordings to map diverse brain areas and assess their relationships with
fluctuating sensory encoding in V1. Aim 2 will determine the fundamental underlying noise level of neurons in
V1, providing a key metric for understanding the fidelity of visual encoding and for models used to analyze
neural data. Together, these aims will advance our understanding of the nature of visual cortical encoding and
the distributed network of brain regions that support visual processing and behavior. These results will improve
our ability to create more effective brain-computer interface therapeutics, which currently rely on an incomplete
understanding of information coding in the brain.
During my tailored training period, I will learn Neuropixels electrophysiology, advanced computational analysis
techniques, and whole-brain histological processing and imaging under the guidance of experts in a supportive
training environment. These skills will prepare me for an independent career as a neuroscientist working to
advance the understanding of brain function and behavior."
10822565,"Project Summary
Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is a debilitating, lifelong disease which currently affects 20 million people
worldwide. Multiple lines of evidence have shown that T cells target and destroy pancreatic β-cells in
individuals with T1D. Though several key autoantigens have been identified, T cell antigen receptors (TCRs)
that recognize these antigens circulate in most individuals, including those who never get T1D.
Genetic studies have shown that T1D is highly heritable, with HLA genes accounting for more risk than
any other locus. We and others have shown that HLA variation influences which TCR sequences survive
thymic selection. TCR sequence has a documented effect on T cell state: select V and J genes give rise to
mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells and hydrophobic CDR3β residues promote regulatory T cell (Treg)
fate (Lagattuta et al., Nat. Immunol., 2022). Because each T cell’s TCR sequence is randomly acquired
through V(D)J recombination prior to T cell differentiation, these relationships are likely causal. We propose
that any given TCR has a functional potential: a distinct likelihood of differentiation over all T cell states.
The proposed research will test the hypothesis that HLA risk alleles cause T1D by selecting β-cell-
specific TCRs with inflammatory functional potential. Such TCRs would promote the differentiation of β-
cell-specific T cells toward pathogenic, effector memory cell states, analogous to the way mucosal-associated
invariant T cell (MAIT) TCRs drive acquisition of the MAIT transcriptional phenotype. Through rigorous
statistical modeling, I will trace the impact of T1D HLA risk on β-cell-specific T cells: from HLA selection of TCR
patterns to the influence of TCR patterns on T cell state. Specifically, the study aims to (1) define which TCR
sequence features influence T cell state, and (2) assess the impact of HLA risk alleles on the pancreatic β-cell
specific TCR repertoire. The translational impact of robustly identifying β-cell-specific TCRs is clear: this could
help therapeutically target autoreactive T cells, could inform engineering of β-cell-specific Tregs, and would
enable clinical monitoring of the β-cell-specific immune response longitudinally. More broadly, this work will
provide a much-needed bioinformatic tool to cluster TCRs by antigen specificity, and will produce novel
insights into how TCR sequence features instruct T cell fate.
 The proposed training plan will enable me to: (A) develop skills in computational methods development,
(B) cultivate statistical expertise for functional genomics and human genetics, (C) gain familiarity with the
generation of high-throughput genomic data, (D) learn the immunological foundations and clinical
manifestations of autoimmune disease, and (E) sharpen professional scientific skills such as oral presentation
and manuscript writing. A resource-rich training environment with close mentorship from experts in
bioinformatic methods development, HLA genetics, TCR sequences, and T cell states in the context of
autoimmunity will prepare me to become a successful physician-scientist leader in computational immunology."
10822423,"Postpartum depression (PPD) is the most frequent major depressive disorder following childbirth and is
associated with adverse outcomes and poor quality of life for the mother and child. Separation during the initial
postpartum period, such as infant admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), impacts maternal-
infant bonding and increases PPD risk by 40%. Feeling disconnected from their infant is a major risk
factor for NICU parents developing PPD. The sense of parents not feeling constantly connected to their
infants during a NICU stay, and low social support create a high emotional burden on the mother and her
partner. PPD risk is decreased when parents have more contact with their infant and a higher perceived social
support system. When physical contact is not possible, voice contact may help to foster feelings of
connectedness. The medical team is another critical source of social support that can alter parental mental
health. Mothers of infants in the NICU report increased depressive symptoms when their perception of nurse
support is low, while increased communication between parents and the medical team improves parental well-
being. Increased social support from loved ones and the medical care team could significantly reduce PPD
severity in parents of babies in the NICU. However, NICU units are primarily focused on infant care and are ill-
equipped to address parental mental health. Facilitating communication between parents and healthcare
providers, as well as between their friends and family, without increasing work burden for healthcare
providers could dramatically impact the mental health and well-being of parents during their baby’s
NICU admission.
VoiceLove LLC is developing a novel HIPAA-compliant mobile application that enables expanded family
engagement by providing an electronic venue for direct patient-family-provider interactions that mitigates
barriers to communication. The VoiceLove app is a safe and time-efficient tool for direct communication with
absent family members, allowing more time for direct patient care. A pilot study with ICU patients at New York-
Presbyterian Hospital demonstrated thousands of direct family messages exchanged without any additional
nursing burden. In this Fast-Track STTR, we will refine the VoiceLove prototype and evaluate the new
application among parents and NICU providers. Phase I will optimize the VoiceLove app for NICU families and
providers. Phase II will include a randomized control trial (RCT) comparing VoiceLove implementation to usual
care control to evaluate the impact of the VoiceLove app on maternal PPD scores and on patient-family-
provider communication and engagement. This Fast-Track STTR represents a major step forward in bringing a
novel technology to the NICU to expand family engagement, empower the clinical experience, and decrease
the prevalence of PPD."

autoimmune diseases with many new therapeutics in development. However, antibodies are
extremely expensive to produce, and large amounts of antibody are required to achieve clinical
efficacy. In our 268 interviews with industry experts and extensive research of the literature,
Protein A-based purification is the largest pain point in mAb manufacturing. The global Protein A
resin market size was estimated at $1.36 B in 2022 and is expected to expand at a CAGR of
11.4%. This market can be divided into the classical resins that have dominated the market and
new alternatives which include membranes. There is a strong desire to move away from resins;
however, a lack of alternatives with superior performance have prevented this. Our Phase I and
II data demonstrate that we have considerable advantages over incumbent suppliers by providing
a high binding capacity, high-flow, single-use membrane that doesn’t rely on crosslinking. At the
end of Phase IIB, we will produce our minimally viable product: a low-cost, high-capacity, single-
use antibody purification membrane that has been validated by key industry players and ready to
be displayed internationally. To do this we will accomplish the following Aims: 1) Industrial Scale
Production runs of protein monomers 2) Produce significant quantities of Bondwell Material 3)
Incorporate BT materials into our custom membrane 4) Validate our 2nd generation membranes
with industry partners. The slow adoption rate of new technologies, preference for brand
reputation, compliance with FDA SOPs, global supply risk, and long runway to revenue lead to
start-ups similar to ours being acquired before any sales occur. Therefore, our goal is not to
manufacture and sell this product but to pursue an early exit through licensing, partnership with,
or acquisition by, established companies. To accomplish this, we will leverage the data generated
from industry partners during this Phase IIB proposal to generate high profile scientific
publications and presentations at leading conferences."

 Despite the rollout of vaccines and Paxlovid for SARS-CoV-2, there continues to be significant demand
for treatments for COVID-19 that (i) can be easily self-administered at home, (ii) reduce risk of hospitalization,
(iii) retain activity against all variants of concern, and (iv) free of drug-drug interactions. SARS-CoV-2, like
many common respiratory viruses, spreads in the airways by shedding progeny virions back up into airway
mucus (AM) before infecting the next cell. The infection remains almost exclusively restricted to the apical side
of the airways as it gradually spreads from the upper respiratory tract to the lower respiratory tract. Importantly,
this means that antiviral treatments must reach the airways to have maximal effect. The AM is difficult to reach
by systemically dosed antibody-based therapies, since 1% or less of IV-infused mAbs distribute to the AM.
Unfortunately, every monoclonal antibody (mAb) for COVID-19 to date has been dosed systemically.
 Inhalon has pioneered methods for the stable, efficient, inhaled delivery of antibody-based drugs for the
treatment of respiratory infections using handheld nebulizers that can administer a dose within minutes per
day. Inhalon has also developed a platform of muco-trapping mAbs, based on tuning sugars on the Fc domain
of mAbs that enable physical trapping of virions to mucins. Muco-trapping mAbs are unique because they can
directly remove the virus from the airways by harnessing natural mucus clearance mechanisms. We validated
our inhaled mAb therapy approach in lambs infected with RSV (a virus that also propagates exclusively by
apical shedding); when our nebulized treatment was given 3 days post-infection (time of peak viral load), the
treated animals benefited from roughly 10,000-fold reductions in viral load, along with excellent improvements
in histopathology. Recently, we completed a Phase 1 human clinical study of the safety, tolerability, and
pharmacokinetics of another inhaled mAb against SARS-CoV-2, and found excellent safety and high
concentrations of drug in the airways, despite using a far lower dose than IV dosing. However, traditional mAbs
are always at risk of viral escape by future variants, motivating us to pursue a broad-spectrum solution.
 Inhalon is advancing IN-007, an inhaled, proprietary, ACE2 decoy-based mAb that retains potent
activity against every variant of SARS-CoV-2 (including Omicron BA.4/5). IN-007 is designed to achieve
bivalent binding, both intra- and inter- S protein spikes. IN-007 is inherently resistant to viral escape, has much
greater binding affinity than conventional ACE2-decoys, enables potent trapping of SARS-CoV-2 in fresh
human AM, and was effective in treating SARS-CoV-2 infections in a pilot study in hamsters. By delivering IN-
007 directly to the airways, we expect to enable efficacious and cost-effective treatment for COVID-19, with
little risk of adverse side effects. In this project, we seek to produce a GLP batch of IN-007, conduct the IND-
enabling studies that are required before advancing to the clinic, and test efficacy in vivo (hamsters) and ex
vivo. The proposed work represents the critical path for rapidly advancing IN-007 for clinical evaluation."

Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG) is a leading cause of death from pediatric cancer, with an abysmal <1%
five-year survival rate. The lethal nature of this cancer stems from the lack of effective treatment options, and
while radiotherapy is the current standard of care, it can be considered is palliative at best. It is difficult to use
surgery or chemotherapy as these tumors form within the blood brain barrier (BBB), in the pons region of the
brainstem. Therefore, significant effort has been directed towards understanding the molecular profiles of DIPG,
which can be targeted for selective tumor cell killing in these tumors. Recently, the Bindra laboratory published
a novel discovery that truncating mutations in PPM1D, which are commonly found in DIPG, induce a global CpG
Island hypermethylation phenotype (CIMP)-like state. This mutation leads to a diverse range of cellular
phenotypes, including metabolic defects which we believe can be exploited for a therapeutic gain. To this end,
we found that mutant PPM1D induces promoter hypermethylation in the NAD+ biosynthesis gene NAPRT, an
important enzyme required to produce NAD+. Our group demonstrated that mutant PPM1D-induced NAPRT
silencing confers exquisite sensitivity to a class of drugs which target NAMPT, another key NAD+ enzyme. This
work was recently published in Nature Communications (Fons et al., 2019). Based on these novel findings, and
the desperate need for new DIPG therapies, we propose to develop NAMPT inhibitors (NAMPTi’s) for the
treatment of PPM1D-mutant DIPG. Blood-brain barrier (BBB)-penetrant NAMPTi’s have been developed and
tested in clinical trials, however, their success has been limited by dose-limiting toxicities in the bone marrow
and retina. To address these liabilities, this proposal aims to develop nanoparticle-encapsulated NAMPT
inhibitors (NAMPTi-NPs) for direct delivery into the tumor microenvironment, and to validate them using
in vitro and in vivo patient-derived models. My proposal will accomplish this goal with two aims: In Aim 1, we
will create and optimize NPs that have high drug encapsulation efficiency, sustained retention of NAMPTi-NP in
target sites, and demonstrate effective cell killing in NHA isogenic cell models and CCLE cell lines. Aim 2 will
show the clinical feasibility of NAMPTi-NP via in vivo modeling that will encompass toxicity screens of free drug
NAMPTi and NAMPTi-NP, as well as the biodistribution of these drugs within the brain. Lastly, we will show
efficacy through reduction in size of PPM1D-mutant tumors treated with NAMPTi-NP. Altogether, this work will
utilize a comprehensive and rigorous bench-based approach, coupled with computational and
bioengineering methods, to develop a novel treatment for DIPG. My studies will serve as a critical proof-of-
concept that seeks to establish an entirely new NP-based strategy targeting a key metabolic defect in DIPG. If
successful, our approach can be applied to many other small molecules and brain tumors in the future."
10799676,"Abstract
Orthopaedic extremity trauma is a major problem resulting in both long-term functional disability and substantial
medical cost in various populations. One such injury is volumetric muscle loss (VML), which is clinically identified
as a chronic and irrecoverable loss of skeletal muscle tissue resulting in functional impairments. VML is coupled
with clinical outcomes related to long-term dysfunction, reduced mobility and physical activity, co-morbidities,
and often delayed amputation. Additionally, a major problem identified in the clinic is an inability to respond to
rehabilitation; even prolonged and intensive rehabilitation has not been able to ameliorate functional
impairments. The fundamental principles of rehabilitation revolve around the plasticity of skeletal muscle, or the
ability to adapt to perceived mechanical or chemical cues in order to improve its functional capacity and
efficiency. We hypothesize that pathophysiologic limitations in the muscle remaining after VML injury relate to
lack of endogenous regenerative ability, such as improvements in whole-body metabolism. We believe that for
the VML-injured patient, pathophysiologic changes to the remaining muscle and co-morbidities to injury, such as
metabolic inflexibility, could be as much of a problem as the primary loss of contractile tissue. To date, a
comprehensive understanding of the natural sequela of injury is absent, specifically, an understanding of the
muscle remaining after injury and how the devastating pathophysiologic changes impact the inherent properties
of muscle. Our central hypothesis is that muscle dysfunction, muscle fiber and whole-body metabolic
insufficiency, and neuromuscular deficiency create a hostile cellular environment in the remaining muscle that
mitigates muscle plasticity and blunts the effectiveness of regenerative rehabilitation. We propose three specific
aims to address these hypotheses: 1) To establish signaling mechanisms of diminished innervation in the
remaining muscle after VML; 2) To identify cellular mechanisms of oxidative adaptation in the remaining muscle
after VML; and 3) To determine the contribution of the remaining muscle to whole-body metabolism after VML
to improve regenerative rehabilitation. The results of the proposed studies will define cellular mechanisms that
contribute to the finite adaptive and regenerative capacity of the remaining muscle after VML and we expect
these results could transformative to clinical care for VML-injured patients both acutely and chronically.
Additionally, fundamental understanding of the lack of regenerative potential in skeletal muscle could be
transformative to other conditions of skeletal muscle such as muscular dystrophies, non-dystrophic myopathies,
and sarcopenia."

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) remains endemic in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), despite an effective vaccine. While
perinatal transmission from mother-to-child has been the prevailing theory for continued HBV endemicity based
on studies in Asia, limited evidence from SSA suggests transmission at the household- and community-levels
is a more important driver of transmission in SSA contexts. Given that scale-up of HBV vaccination will be slow
and insufficient to reach the World Health Organization goal of HBV elimination by 2030, additional prevention
measures are needed for HBV control, which first require a better understanding of HBV transmission in SSA.
The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has a national HBV prevalence of ~3.3%, which translates to
approximately 3.5 million chronic infections in a setting where advanced hepatology care is essentially
inaccessible. This proposal builds upon a strong research infrastructure (~20 years) between scientists at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) and in DRC’s capital city, Kinshasa, to study HBV
transmission using data and samples from an ongoing household-based case-control study and from the
DRC’s latest national Demographic and Health Survey. The overall goal of this proposal is to improve
understanding of HBV transmission in a low-resourced, sub-Saharan Africa setting.
The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) Characterize the epidemiology of HBV transmission in
households in urban Kinshasa, DRC, and identify associated individual, household, and community
risk factors; and 2) Investigate evidence of community-level horizontal transmission using
phylogenetic analysis.
Through this research proposal and a carefully constructed training plan, the trainee will achieve the following
fellowship goals: 1) develop a unique and interdisciplinary research skillset that integrates epidemiology,
geography, genetics, and infectious diseases; 2) engage in meaningful clinical training that will enhance the
trainee’s future clinical practice and the translation of research findings to clinically relevant interventions; and
3) develop professional skills that will facilitate a successful academic career as a physician-scientist."
10799688,"The hippocampus and the parahippocampal region of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) consist of
anatomically and functionally distinct subregions that are selectively targeted by different pathological
processes in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and semantic variant Primary
Progressive Aphasia (svPPA). In AD, in vivo MRI studies investigating MTL subregions have often shown
mixed findings that are inconsistent with post-mortem pathology studies. These inconsistencies likely result
from the lack of validity and standardization in MTL segmentation approaches. In svPPA, MTL subregions are
severely affected, and automated tools fail to segment the subregions accurately. Sufficient spatial resolution
of imaging voxels is required to visualize the internal MTL structures and landmarks that are critical for valid
segmentation of the subregions. While more than 15,000 high-resolution scans have been collected worldwide,
the lack of standardization among MTL subregional segmentation protocols is still a significant barrier.
Variability in the definition of the MTL subregional boundaries among existing segmentation protocols have
contributed to the conflicting findings in the field. This proposal seeks to accelerate progress made by our
group, the Hippocampal Subfields Group, and complete our standardized, valid, and reliable harmonized
protocol for the segmentation of MTL subregions in high-resolution MRI scans. We will leverage our ongoing,
successful efforts, and evaluate the proposed harmonized protocol in scans from multicentric datasets. In Aim
1, we will finalize our harmonized segmentation protocol that is a) based on a large histology dataset and
developed in collaboration with neuroanatomists, b) assessed by the larger community to reach consensus, c)
tested for reliability, and d) implemented in an existing automated software program. In Aim 2, we will validate
the harmonized protocol in early-stage AD through associations with markers of specific pathologies: a) test for
anatomical specificity of the associations between atrophy rates across MTL subregions to PET measures of
MTL tau-pathology and markers of cardiovascular risk in patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment and cerebral
β-amyloid. In Aim 3, we will further evaluate the validity and utility of the harmonized protocol in svPPA by
performing manual segmentation of the MTL subregions using the HSG protocol and testing for anatomical
specificity of volume atrophy. In Aim 4, we will facilitate wide adoption of our protocol by providing training and
education materials, in-person workshops for manual and automated segmentation, and making outcome
measures publicly available. Our valid, reliable, and reproducible protocol for MTL subregions segmentation
will benefit groups worldwide that have and continue to collect thousands of high-resolution data to study a
variety of neurological and psychiatric conditions. It also lays the foundation for future research on how distinct
disease processes in the MTL subregions may lead to impairments in specific cognitive functions. Our
harmonization process can be adapted for achieving valid, harmonized segmentation for other brain regions."
10821985,"Conditional Animal Models of mtDNA Disease: Abstract
Mitochondria are critical for metabolism, organ homeostasis, apoptosis, and aging. This wide range of impact is
manifested by the enormous biological variation and diverse disorders in patients with mitochondrial disease
affecting organs such as the eye, ear, brain, muscle, and kidney. Understanding how mitochondria function in
normal biology - and how human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variations contribute to health and disease - has
been hampered by a lack of animal models due to limited approaches to manipulate this powerhouse of the cell.
This project aims to resolve this major technical bottleneck in the field to enable us to deploy a full complement
of gene editors to introduce precise edits in the mitochondrial genome in a manner capable of temporal and
spatial control and to use these to make the first conditional animal model of mitochondrial disease using
zebrafish.
 CRISPR gene editing tools have enabled the rapid manipulation of the nuclear genome. CRISPR
systems are dual molecular, with Cas protein and gRNA components. They are not currently operational in the
mitochondrial compartment however because of a lack of effective methods to deliver exogenous guide RNAs.
We have identified an endogenously trafficked RNA that can carry targeted nucleotide changes from the nucleus
into mitochondria, representing a potential novel method for the introduction of programmed RNAs suitable for
use as guide molecules for CRISPR Cas proteins in mitochondria. When combined with a Cre-regulated
mitochondrial Cas12a base editor, we will generate a conditional zebrafish disease model for multi-systemic
mtDNA-encoded mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS).
 The establishment of this toolkit will not only shed mechanistic insights but will also facilitate the
genomic nosology of a large class of mitochondrial disorders. If successful, the versatile mtRNA chimeric
gRNA delivery system will enable us to model different mitochondrial pathogenic variations. This application
harnesses the unique environment of mitochondria to generate a new toolbox to expand the repertoire of tools
to edit the mitochondrial genome."
10822446,"There is an outbreak of Marburg virus disease (MVD), relative of Ebola virus, currently ongoing in Equatorial
Guinea and Tanzania. There have been multiple, deadly outbreaks of MVD in the past with ~88% lethality.
There are currently no approved vaccines or therapeutics for MVD and very few in clinical development. In
this proposal, we have rationally designed an immunogen based on MARV glycoprotein (GP) by excluding
domains known to trigger non-neutralizing antibodies allowing exposure of key neutralizing epitopes capable
of generating a strong immune response. Combined with a novel TLR7/8 agonist adjuvant, Alhydroxyquim-
II (AhQ-II), that has shown excellent safety and adjuvant activity in millions of people during COVID-19
pandemic, our rationally designed MARV vaccine induces broadly neutralizing antibodies against isolates
Angola, CI67, and Musoke strains of MARV as well as the phylogenetically more distant RAVV. Mice
immunized with this MARV vaccine with two or three doses compared to unadjuvanted antigen showed
robust antigen-specific binding and neutralizing titers against all four MARV strains demonstrated by ELISA
and pseudovirus neutralization assays. In the guinea pig model of MARV infection which shows all hallmarks
of filovirus disease the vaccine provided 100% protection against lethal challenge with no detectable viremia,
suggesting that the vaccine is likely inducing sterilizing immunity. In summary, this subunit vaccine represents
a novel, highly efficacious, and safe candidate for protection against MVD. Here, we propose three specific
aims to further develop this rationally designed immunogen: Aim1: To produce and generate a pooled stable
cell line for the MARV subunit antigen with a cGMP-compliant tag and demonstrate biochemical and
immunogenic properties comparable to the Streptavidin-tagged MARV material used in preliminary studies;
Aim 2: to determine optimal effective dose and regimen for maximum protection in BSL-4 guinea pig MARV
model; Aim 3: to demonstrate immunogenicity in the filovirus Gold Standard non-human primate model. Upon
successful completion of this Phase I project we anticipate a Phase II focused on NHP efficacy studies and
advanced development activities."
10824217,"Project Summary
Strategies to identify novel therapeutics typically include targeting enzymatic activities involved in relevant
biological pathways, with the assumption that this approach will most likely identify potent, safe, and bioavailable
drugs. This concept is particularly relevant to the development of epigenetic perturbants such as histone
deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, or “HDACis”. All seven FDA-approved HDACis bind in similar ways to
promiscuous deacetylase enzymatic pockets. While such “enzymatic inhibitor” compounds are used successfully
to treat T cell lymphomas and multiple myelomas, they remain limited in addressing other types of cancers.
One of the major limitations of currently available HDACis is that, by systematically targeting HDAC enzymatic
pockets, they show little specificity for various HDAC complexes responsible for the regulation of different
subsets of genes, and consequently, they affect the transcriptional regulation of a large portion of the
transcriptome. Our goal here is to develop an alternative model according to which “protein interaction
modulators” perturb specific protein interactions in subsets of HDAC subcomplexes and thus have much
narrower effects on the transcriptome of treated cells than conventional HDACis. The central hypothesis of this
model is that perturbing specific HDAC subcomplexes rather than all HDAC complexes in a cell might result in
much narrower transcriptional effects and yet confer potent anti-tumorigenic effects (Fig. 1). To test this
hypothesis, we propose the three following specific aims.
Aim 1. To determine the extent to which small-molecule perturbations of non-enzymatic subunits of
HDAC complexes can affect their repressing functions. Our goal is to identify a new class of HDAC
modulators, which, instead of targeting enzymatic pockets, would affect other, more specific functions of HDAC
complexes.
Aim 2. To compare global transcriptomic effects of HDAC non-enzymatic versus enzymatic small-
molecule perturbations. One branch of our central hypothesis is that it should be possible to identify HDAC
complex modulators that result in much narrower transcriptional effects than those observed with conventional
HDAC enzymatic inhibitors. Here we will determine transcriptome-wide effects of HDAC subcomplex modulators
to investigate how widely or narrowly these new compounds affect the transcriptome.
Aim 3. To test the hypothesis that promoter occupancy perturbations of HDAC complexes can potently
abrogate tumorigenic phenotypes. We will test to what extent perturbing specific HDAC subcomplexes rather
than all cellular HDAC complexes, while resulting in much narrower transcriptional effects, might nevertheless
confer potent anti-tumorigenic effects.
In short, we propose that instead of affecting all HDAC activities in the cell as conventional HDAC inhibitors do,
a new class of protein interaction modulators can be identified that affect specific HDAC subcomplexes."

Asthma is a chronic, widespread allergic disease with total expenses exceeding $80 billion annually in the U.S.
Current therapies for asthma are modestly successful but leave significant subpopulations of patients without
adequate response. Specifically, type 2 asthma patients can develop steroid dependency, while non-type 2
asthma has a lower responsiveness to current treatments. Recent attempts to target this population have been
unsuccessful, with anti-TNF, anti-IL-17 receptor and chemokine inhibitors failing in clinical trials [2, 3], while
macrolides and methotrexate have shown mild improvement but at high side effect risk [4, 5]. Thus, there is an
unmet medical need for safer and more efficacious asthma therapeutics. In the last years, regulatory T cells
(Treg) have gained increased recognition in the treatment of inflammatory and allergic diseases. Manipulation
of Treg cells to restore their suppressive capacity has been postulated as a promising novel therapeutic
approach. This SBIR Phase I application will develop a novel, oral, once-daily, immunoregulatory
therapeutic for the treatment of asthma.
The Specific Aims are to:
AIM 1. Characterize the therapeutic efficacy and route of administration of the novel immunoregulatory
compound in mouse models of asthma. We will use the ovalbumin and house dust mite models to determine
the therapeutic efficacy by airway resistance, lung histopathology, flow cytometry and cytokine expression.
AIM 2. Determine the translational ability of the novel therapeutic in human primary cells from asthma
patients, by assessing cytokine and metabolic profile, plus suppressive Treg capacity in coculture studies in
bronchial epithelial (HDBE) cells and PBMCs from asthma donors, respectively.
Expected successful outcomes are: i) ≥ 50% suppression of airway resistance and ≥ 50% decreased infiltration
of neutrophils in the lungs of treated mice; and ii) ≥ 70% reduction in IL-8 and IL-6 expression in treated HDBE.
Commercial Application: The impact of this new, oral, immunoregulatory asthma drug has the potential to
disrupt an annual market estimated to reach $20 billion by 2026."
10784484,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Background: This proposal is designed for Dr. Kimberly Lakin, MD, MS to grow toward becoming an
independent investigator focused upon characterizing the clinical significance of immune cell-fibroblast
associations in systemic sclerosis (SSc) skin. Currently, there are no approved treatments to manage both skin
and internal organ fibrosis caused by systemic sclerosis (SSc), a deadly autoimmune disease with a complex
and poorly understood pathophysiology involving inflammation and excess collagen production by skin
fibroblasts. In clinical and trial settings, some patients improve, at times dramatically, while others do not,
possibly related to distinct disease phases when cells are amenable (or not) to treatment. Reliable tools are
needed to inform individualized treatment decisions and trial enrollment. Preliminary data by Dr. Lakin and her
mentors suggest assessments of fibroblast activation status may yield such a tool.
Preliminary data: Using paired biological (histology, gene expression) and clinical data from 24 individuals with
diffuse cutaneous (dc)SSc, histologic assessments of two, inversely related fibroblast markers (aSMA, CD34)
were associated with clinical severity and predicted the SSc inflammatory gene expression subset, using
machine learning methods. Samples with inflammatory vs. non-inflammatory fibroblasts had increased B cells
and type I interferon gene signature. A gene signature of fibroblast polarization (by aSMA/CD34) was
computed and found to be higher at baseline in 52-week clinical improvers vs. non-improvers.
Methods: Fine phenotype mapping of dcSSc (n=105), preSSc (Very Early Onset of SSc; n=12) and healthy
(n=12) skin will be performed cross-sectionally. Immune pathways and cell types associated with activated
fibroblasts will be evaluated by imaging mass cytometry (IMC), digital cell deconvolution, and histology. In a
longitudinal analysis, baseline clinical and molecular features (histology scores; immune cell and fibroblast
polarization signatures) will be tested as inputs in a model to predict 52 weeks clinical improvement.
Career Development: The study goal is to unravel immune cell-fibroblast interactions in SSc and to test a
histology-derived model for classifying patients most likely to clinically improve at one year. Dr. Lakin is an
assistant attending physician at Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) and assistant attending professor of
medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College with access to the outstanding core services at these institutions.
She will conduct patient-oriented research under the mentorship of Dr. Robert Spiera (HSS), an expert in SSc
clinical research, and Dr. Dana Orange (Rockefeller), an expert in the use of bioinformatic approaches to
discover patient subsets in rheumatic diseases. Dr. Lakin will engage in experiential and formal coursework to
advance her bioinformatics, immunology, and skin imaging mass cytometry skills. This career development
award will position Dr. Lakin for success in her objective to become an R01-funded independent investigator
focused upon improving SSc patient care while uncovering key mechanisms of SSc pathogenesis."
10788304,"Chronic pain and disability after war-related injuries and after trauma sustained in civilian settings are
unexpectedly common. Chronic pain related to traumatic brain injury (TBI) in combination with peripheral
injuries is particularly problematic, and we have no well-validated treatments. Potentially explaining the TBI-
chronic pain relationship, data from both humans and animal models suggest that descending pain
modulation is disrupted after TBI. Recently collected data using laboratory models of brain injury and TBI
patients demonstrate the vulnerability of brainstem centers governing endogenous pain modulation.
Histopathological and functional TBI studies suggest damage to the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG), a
major endogenous pain control center, and the locus coeruleus (LC), a key structure providing descending
noradrenergic inhibition to the spinal cord. Moreover, TBI alters the function of the rostral ventromedial
medulla (RVM), a structure that provides both descending pain-facilitating and pain-inhibiting serotonergic
fibers. Our main objective is, therefore, to evaluate endogenous pain regulatory mechanisms after TBI and
pre-clinically test translatable approaches to pain control in this setting.
 In the first aim we evaluate the hypothesis that TBI disrupts descending pain modulation by altering
descending noradrenergic and serotonergic circuits. The experimental approach uses a well-validated rat
fluid percussion model of TBI studied along a broad time course to mimic sub-acute and chronic injuries.
Highly selective and clinically available pharmacological tools targeting noradrenalin release, serotonergic
tone and the stimulation of α2-adrenergic, as well as 5-HT3 and 5-HT7 receptors will be employed.
Outcomes will focus on the regulation of nociceptive thresholds and the efficiency of descending pain
modulation circuits.
 In the second aim we evaluate the hypothesis that TBI injures neurons and promotes sustained neuro-
inflammation in the LC and RVM as well as giving rise to functional changes in descending pain modulation.
In addition to neuropathological evaluations of brainstem and spinal tissues, we will use the microinjection
of selective neurotoxins and chemogenetic DREADDs to study the function of brainstem pain regulatory
centers after TBI.
 In the final aim we use two models of polytrauma combining TBI with soft tissue incision and, separately,
tibial fracture. We hypothesize that clinically available modulators of noradrenergic and serotonergic
signaling will reduce nociceptive sensitization, enhance descending pain modulation and reduce the
interaction of peripheral trauma and TBI on neuroinflammation and the expression of several pain-related
spinal genes. By reducing chronic pain-related changes we further hypothesize that functional measures,
anxiety and cognitive changes will all be less affected after the injuries.
 At the time of completion of the project we expect to understand better how TBI, peripheral injury and
the combination of injuries cause chronic pain. In the process of this evaluation we will delineate the roles of
dysfunction in specific brainstem pain modulating centers. We anticipate being in position to plan
translational human studies using some of the same agents and approaches employed preclinically."
10788306,"Thirty percent of African Americans (AAs) with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) have (DM), which increases
risk for progression to dementia. Poorly controlled DM magnifies this risk, but whether improving glycemic
control reduces the risk is uncertain. Previous studies have lacked rigor to resolve this uncertainty. The
proposed randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies a high-risk population, which confers greater rigor. This
single-site, double-blind, active-control, phase II RCT will compare the efficacy of DM-Specific Behavioral
Activation (DM-BA) vs. Enhanced Usual Care (EUC) to prevent decline in verbal memory (primary outcome)
over 2 years in 200 AAs over age 65 years with amnestic multiple-domain MCI and poorly controlled DM. DM-
BA is a behavioral treatment for DM, as well as a secondary prevention strategy for dementia. In DM-BA, race-
concordant community health workers will: 1) deliver in-home DM education tailored to persons with MCI;
2) use action plans to reinforce DM self-care; 3) facilitate telehealth visits with a DM nurse educator to guide
DM care and address participants’ health beliefs; and 4) increase primary care physicians’ (PCP) awareness of
participants’ cognitive deficits and health beliefs to optimize treatment of DM. The control treatment, EUC, is
usual medical care enhanced with DM self-care education. Both DM-BA and EUC deliver DM education and
have the same number of in-home treatment visits (i.e., 6 visits over 6 months, and 5 booster visits over the
next 18 months). EUC, however, does not include DM-BA’s behavioral approach to improve glycemic control,
telehealth visits, or PCP communication. The treatment comparison will identify DM-BA’s specific efficacy over
and above EUC. Participants will be recruited from primary care practices. We will administer the Hopkins
Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) (to assess verbal memory; the primary outcome) and the Uniform
Data Set neuropsychological battery (to assess executive function, processing speed, language, visuospatial
function, and global cognition; all exploratory outcomes) at baseline and months 6, 12, 18, and 24. The
primary efficacy analysis will compare trajectories in HVLT-R Total Recall scores over 2 years by treatment
group. We will also explore whether APOE genotype moderates treatment effects, and whether Optical
Coherence Tomography measures of retinal Vessel Area Density (a proxy for cerebral microvascular disease)
and/or Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer thickness (a proxy for cerebral neurodegeneration) mediate treatment effects.
This RCT is innovative because it will clarify whether improving glycemic control prevents cognitive decline in a
high risk population and identify possible treatment mechanisms. This RCT is significant because it targets two
major problems facing older AAs (i.e., poor glycemic control and dementia). AAs’ high risk for this comorbidity
reflects the impact of cultural factors (e.g., health beliefs) and requires culturally relevant treatment. We have
the experience and expertise to test this treatment, and the opportunity to change how DM is treated to prevent
cognitive decline in AAs with MCI and DM and meet the goals of the National Alzheimer’s Project Act."
10788313,"Lung cancer (LC) is the leading cause of cancer mortality in the U.S. Although tobacco smoking and some
environmental exposures contribute substantially to lung cancer risk, family studies show an additional strong
contribution from genetic factors. The Genetic Epidemiology of Lung Cancer Consortium (GELCC) has been
collecting samples and data from individuals with a strong family history of LC for the last 20 years, and has
assembled a unique resource of specimens and data. We have cancer phenotypes, smoking exposure data
and biological specimens available on multiple relatives in over 150 highly aggregated LC families (high-risk
familial lung cancer families, HRFLC cases/families) as well as phenotype, genotype and smoking data on
over 800 additional lung cancer cases who have a family history of at least one first or second degree relative
with lung cancer but for whom biospecimens were not available from additional relatives (familial cases from
biospecimen limited families, FLC cases). The goal of this research application is to identify genetic
factors that confer a high risk for lung cancer and to perform research to characterize further the
mechanisms by which these factors influence lung cancer risk. Identifying genetic factors for lung cancer
provides insight into the specific causes and pathways underlying its development. In addition, if high-risk
individuals can be identified they will reap the greatest benefit from screening modalities.
 We propose three aims. In aim 1 we will identify genetic factors conferring a high-risk of lung
cancer development.. In this aim, we will complete analyses of WES data from 33 HRFLC families
comprising 291 individuals along with 114 FLC cases and case/control analyses of 1084 lung cancer cases
compared with 919 controls. We will use these data along with linkage analysis to prioritize uncommon variants
that have a strong effect on lung cancer risk. In Aim 2 we will extend and validate findings to a broader
population. We will also collect additional samples from LC cases in HRLFC. We will sequence the most
strongly associated variants and genes from Aim 1 in additional affected and unaffected individuals in the
sequenced families and an additional set of FLC cases and frequency matched controls. This aim will allow us
to a) validate findings from aim 1 using a larger collection of cases with a family history of lung cancer and
controls and b) assess the impact on risk in families according to smoking behavior and genetic contributions.
In Aim 3 we will study the impact that variants found in aims 1 and 2 have on cellular biology. We will
study the effect that specific mutations have on cellular phenotypes identified in aims 1 and 2 using CRISPR
technology. We will begin by studying mutations in PARK2 that we recently identified in 5 HRLFC families and
in E2A we previously studied. The proposed research will bring new insights into the etiology of lung cancer."
10788314,"Approximately 10% of Veterans with hearing complaints have clinically normal audiograms. Unfortunately,
treatment options for these patients are limited and the outcomes are variable, resulting in a lack of consensus
on how to manage these patients. Loss of the cochlear synapses between inner hair cells and afferent auditory
nerve fibers can co-occur with normal hearing thresholds and may account for these perceptual complaints.
However, subclinical outer hair cell (OHC) damage or central auditory deficits, such as those arising from
traumatic brain injury, could lead to similar problems. The variability in treatment outcomes may be due to
the heterogeneous nature of the underlying damage, which cannot be determined using existing clinical
tests. The best treatment approach may depend on the specific type of damage. Although OHC function can be
assessed with otoacoustic emissions (OAEs), current audiological testing cannot differentiate between
peripheral deafferentation and damage to the central auditory system. However, several physiological measures
are sensitive to deafferentation in animal models. These include the auditory brainstem response (ABR), the
envelope following response (EFR), and the middle ear muscle reflex (MEMR). Our published and preliminary
data show that ABR, EFR, and MEMR measurements are reduced in magnitude among young Veterans who
report high levels of noise exposure during their military service compared to non-Veterans with limited noise
exposure, consistent with animal models of noise-induced deafferentation. In addition, our data indicates that
reductions in these measurements are associated with auditory perceptual deficits such as tinnitus and increased
cognitive load (i.e., listening effort) during complex speech perception. The overall objective of this proposal is
to develop a clinical test for deafferentation and determine the perceptual impacts of this condition. Our central
hypothesis is that patients with deafferentation can be identified by comparing their physiological measurements
to those from a normative sample with a low risk of deafferentation and that patients with abnormal
measurements will have auditory perceptual deficits (tinnitus, hyperacusis, and difficulty with complex speech
perception, including increased listening effort). We plan to test our hypothesis by pursuing three specific aims:
1) Identify normative ranges for ABR, EFR, and MEMR measurements, statistically adjusted for sex and OHC
function, that can be used to identify patients likely to have significant cochlear deafferentation; 2) Compare
ABR, EFR, and MEMR measurements in terms of their ability to differentiate between groups with low vs. high
deafferentation risk; and 3) Characterize the relationship between abnormal physiological measurements and
auditory perceptual deficits. This approach is innovative because it 1) allows for identification of deafferentation
in individual patients; 2) incorporates OHC function, through OAE measurements, into the normative ranges; 3)
investigates the best combination of test measures/stimuli for identifying deafferentation, including the use of
new EFR and MEMR measurements; and 4) assesses increased listening effort during complex speech
perception as a possible consequence of deafferentation. The proposed research is significant because there is
currently no clinical test for deafferentation and the perceptual consequences of deafferentation are unclear,
preventing the development of treatment options. This study is expected to result in 1) identification of
physiological test measures and stimulus parameters, with normative ranges, that we can recommend for clinical
assessment of cochlear deafferentation and 2) clarification of the perceptual impacts of deafferentation. Clinical
recommendations for diagnosing deafferentation will have immediate impacts on clinical practice by allowing
audiologists to test for deafferentation. A clinical test for deafferentation in combination with measurement of
OHC function using OAEs will allow for differential diagnosis of peripheral auditory damage. Future research can
then focus on treatments for specific peripheral sites of lesion (e.g., individualized hearing aid algorithms based
on the degree of OHC damage and deafferentation or drug treatments for synapse repair or regeneration)."
10788412,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT:
 Clinical and preclinical studies have linked synapse loss and impaired prefrontal cortex (PFC) function to
behavioral and cognitive symptoms of psychiatric diseases, such as major depressive disorder (MDD).
Preclinical models, such as chronic unpredictable stress (CUS), are important tools to study these
pathophysiological mechanisms as they recapitulate key neurobiological (i.e., synapse loss in PFC) and
behavioral (i.e., anhedonia, working memory impairment) aspects of MDD. This is significant because exposure
to psychosocial or environmental stressors increases risk of development and recurrence of psychiatric disease.
Accumulating evidence shows that the brain-resident macrophages, microglia, have an active role in regulating
neuroplasticity in physiological and pathological conditions. In support of this work, research in our lab indicates
that dynamic neuron-microglia interactions contribute to neurobiological and behavioral consequences following
chronic stress. In particular, CUS increases neuronal colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF1) signaling in the medial
PFC, which provokes microglia-mediated neuronal remodeling that contributes to synaptic deficits and
behavioral and cognitive consequences.
 Stress-induced release of glucocorticoids are implicated in the pathophysiology of psychiatric diseases. The
actions of glucocorticoids are mediated by glucocorticoid receptors (GR), which regulate gene transcription.
Indeed prior work shows that GR signaling alters gene networks that drive structural remodeling and synapse
loss on pyramidal neurons in the PFC. Our recent studies indicate that GR signaling induces neuronal CSF1
signaling in the PFC and provokes microglia-mediated neuronal remodeling in the PFC, which contributes to
development of depressive behaviors after CUS. This work also revealed that GR signaling regulates specific
molecular pathways in neurons (REDD1; regulated in development and DNA damage response 1) and microglia
(TNFα; tumor necrosis factor-α). These findings are relevant because both neuronal REDD1 and microglial TNFα
have critical roles in regulating synaptic plasticity. Studies in this application will determine the contributions of
neuronal or microglial GR signaling and respective downstream mediators in the pathophysiology underlying
behavioral consequences of chronic stress. Here we will use brain region- and cell type-specific genetic and
pharmacological manipulations to test two specific aims: 1) Define the role of neuronal GR signaling and
downstream REDD1 in stress-induced CSF1 signaling, microglia-mediated neuronal remodeling, and associated
behavioral consequences; and 2) Examine the role of microglial GR signaling and downstream TNFα in stress-
induced microglia-mediated neuronal remodeling, synaptic deficits, and associated behavioral consequences.
These studies are significant because they will identify molecular and cellular adaptations that initiate stress-
induced synapse loss in the PFC. We expect to generate novel insight into cell type-specific pathways that drive
the neurobiology of stress, which may guide treatment strategies for psychiatric disease."
10788417,"Project Abstract
Research: Asymmetric cell division is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that affords self-renewal,
differentiation and diversification of cell populations. It is unknown, however, if human T cells use this
mechanism to induce distinct daughter cell fates. The proposed research will test the hypothesis that
asymmetric cell division is an indispensable mechanism of human T cells to generate functionally distinct
daughter cells. The experiments will use a novel method of target-induced labeling of the immunological
synapse, multicolor flow cytometry, single cell RNA sequencing and metabolomic profiling to identify and
ultimately modulate cellular programs that support long- and short-lived progeny induction in both native and
genetically-engineered human T cells. A better understanding of cell division patterns will expand our
knowledge on human T cell differentiation, uncover factors promoting niche-specific T cell persistence, and
establish biology-driven principles and methods for optimization of T cell immunotherapy.
Candidate: Dr. Ellebrecht earned his MD from the University of Lubeck, Germany and will complete
Dermatology residency training at the University of Pennsylvania in 2021. Dr. Ellebrecht is pursuing
postdoctoral training in Dr. Aimee Payne’s and Dr. Carl June’s laboratories at Penn. The 5-year career
development plan includes structured coursework and training in single cell transcriptional profiling,
bioinformatics, and metabolic profiling of human T cells from experienced mentors and collaborators, along
with professional career development activities, with the goal of establishing an independent, NIH-funded
research laboratory investigating fate induction and longevity of skin-resident and engineered T cells.
Environment: The mentors, Dr. Aimee Payne and Dr. Carl June, are renowned NIH-funded Penn investigators,
who provide unparalleled expertise in T cell biology, immunotherapy, metabolomics and single cell
characterization of human T cells in combination with an exceptional mentoring record including prior K08 and

to independence that sets him apart from Dr. Payne’s and Dr. June’s focus on translational immunotherapy.
Dr. Ellebrecht’s research and training will be supported by the Penn Dermatology Department, Center for
Cellular Immunotherapy and CHOP metabolomics core, providing state-of the-art core facilities for flow
cytometry, cell sorting, single cell sequencing, metabolomics, human skin xenografts and bioinformatics. Taken
together, his mentors, collaborators and access to these top-notch technologies will create an ideal
environment for Dr. Ellebrecht to thrive on his path towards becoming an independent physician scientist
leading efforts to characterize and modulate T cell populations responsible for chronic inflammatory skin

10783934,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CART) have revolutionized cancer therapy. However, CART cause two
common and severe toxicities: Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and Immune Effector Cell Associated
Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS). CRS and ICANS are overlapping phenomena that occur with a spectrum of
severity from mild to life threatening. Effective therapies for CRS currently exist but severe refractory cases still
occur. Effective therapies for ICANS are lacking. The pathophysiology of CRS and ICANS have not yet been
fully defined, precluding development and translation of novel therapies. In particular, the role of the host
innate immune system in these conditions is poorly understood.
The specific objective of this project is to identify the cellular and cytokine initiators of CRS and the role of
complement and the inflammasome in the biology of ICANS. In Specific Aim 1, the candidate will determine the
number and transcriptional activation state of different monocyte and non-monocyte populations associated
with CRS using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and test the role of novel monocyte produced
cytokines in the priming and initiation of CRS. In Specific Aim 2, the candidate will dissect the role of the
inflammasome and complement dysregulation in the development of ICANS, and test individual and combined
approaches for inflammasome and complement blockade in preventing and treating ICANS.
The candidate is a pediatric oncologist committed to understanding immune dysregulation disorders that occur
as a consequence of cancer immunotherapy. The proposed training plan and research project will be
conducted at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and the University of Pennsylvania (UPENN).
CHOP and UPENN are leaders in cellular immunotherapies and basic and clinical immunology and will provide
an outstanding environment in which to conduct the proposed research. Throughout the period of the award
the candidate will be mentored by Dr. David Teachey and a very strong advisory committee including Drs. Ed
Behrens, Marcela Maus, Wenchao Song and Stephan Grupp. The long-term goal of the candidate is to
develop a research program devoted to understanding the role of the innate immune system in immune
dysregulation related to cancer immunotherapies, and improving the health of patients by facilitating translation
of less toxic, more effective immunotherapies. Completion of the proposed research project and the
complementary training plan will provide a robust foundation to achieve this goal."

Scrub typhus is an emerging and life threating zoonosis caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi (Ot), a Gram-negative
bacterium that replicates in macrophages and endothelial cells. Severe infection is linked to vascular dysfunction,
multiorgan failure, and high mortality. Alarmingly, this infection has emerged to countries outside of the traditional
“Tsutsugamushi triangle.” No vaccines are yet available, partially due to limited research in Ot biology,
immunology, and pathogenesis, as genetic manipulation is not yet feasible for Ot strains. To address these
knowledge gaps, we seek support for this R61/R33 project, in which we will apply random mutagenesis to
generate mutants in Ot Karp strain, which is responsible for ~50% of infections in the world. In pilot studies with
Rickettsia conorii, a member within the family Rickettsiaceae, we constructed a Himar1-mariner-based
transposon plasmid (carrying a codon-optimized polycistronic construct encoding for antibiotic, fluorescent and
luminescent markers) and tested its applicability for genome-wide mutagenesis. We also optimized
electroporation protocols and transformed Ot Karp strain with a self-replicating plasmid and verified
transformants for their expression of fluorescent proteins. These pilot studies establish the amicability of Ot for
genetic manipulation and feasibility for application of Himar1-based mutagenesis for generation of a genome-
wide mutant library for in-depth molecular investigation of Ot biology and genetics. Accordingly, in Aim 1 (R61
phase), we will apply a streamlined random mutagenesis approach to generate a genome-wide mutant library
in Ot strain Karp and isolate clonal mutants by fluorescence-based live cell sorting and via plaque and focus
forming assays. We will confirm the disrupted locus in each mutant by three independent approaches. A series
of technical milestones have been developed to systematically guide the progression of the R61 phase and lay
a solid foundation for the R33 phase of the project. Our objective is to generate a minimum of 50 Ot mutants
which will be further classified and ranked based on the deleted gene, protein domain analysis, conservation of
the disrupted gene among other Ot strains, and mutant growth kinetics in vitro. In Aim 2 (R33 phase), we will
characterize novel Ot mutant strains for their infectivity in vitro and disease pathogenesis in our established
mouse models. We will assess bacterial replication dynamics and immune responses elicited by Ot mutants
during the infection of primary cell cultures in vitro. The genetic contributions to pathogenesis and bacterial
dissemination by Ot mutants will be evaluated in vivo utilizing our highly susceptible CD-1 mouse model (i.v.
route) and Infgr1-/- C57BL/6 model (i.d. route) and by bioluminescence-based live imaging in the ABSL3. Overall,
this is the first study to develop a genome-wide mutant library in Ot, a highly significant and valuable tool that
will be shared among the research community. It will advance our understanding of Ot biology and pathogenesis
and future development of therapeutics."
10786307,"Abstract
 Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a leading cause of blinding corneal infections worldwide. The type III
secretion system (T3SS), a molecular syringe that allows the bacterium to inject effector proteins into host cells,
is critical for P. aeruginosa virulence. P. aeruginosa isolates do not produce many effector proteins and even
more curiously, genes for the effectors ExoS and ExoU are distributed in a mutually exclusive fashion. This
distribution materially affects the virulence of the strains. ExoS producing strains can invade epithelial cells in
vitro, are slower to elicit overt lysis of host cells, and cause a less fulminant infections with less tissue destruction
in vivo. ExoU producing strains, on the other hand, tend to cause more severe disease, and are linked to
increased antibiotic resistance. While ExoS producing strains predominate in the environment and in patients
with cystic fibrosis or ventilator-associated pneumonia, ExoU-producing strains are significantly enriched among
corneal isolates from keratitis patients.
 The correlation between production of ExoU, increased disease severity in the clinic, and elevated
frequency of multidrug resistant isolates has been documented epidemiologically for decades. However, the
molecular underpinnings of this correlation are not well understood. The exoU gene is encoded on a
pathogenicity island, which can vary greatly in size, ranging from as little as 4 kb to 81 kb. The role of the
accessory genes present on the ExoU pathogenicity island is unclear, but our preliminary work demonstrates
that they play an important role in pathogenesis. However, which ExoU-island genes are important for virulence
and whether these pathogenicity island genes can also help explain the increased frequency of antibiotic
resistant isolates is unclear. The goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that ExoU islands encode virulence
functions other than ExoU and that, at least in some instances, they also contribute to the increased antibiotic
resistance associated with this class of P. aeruginosa strains. The proposal is divided into two aims, that will
dissect the virulence role of the two largest ExoU islands: the 30kb, type B ExoU island of strain 19660 (Aim 1),
and the 81 kB, type A ExoU island of strain 6077 (Aim 2). Strain 6077 is a multidrug resistant corneal isolate that
belongs to the globally distributed, high-risk ST235 sequence type. We will also examine the role of the type A
ExoU island as it relates to antibiotic resistance.
 Taken together the proposed program of research will uncover new virulence functions which will expand
our understanding of the molecular toolbox available to bacterial pathogens. The proposal is aimed squarely at
understanding the virulence of the most pathogenic and difficult to treat P. aeruginosa infections encountered in
the clinic."

There is growing evidence demonstrating that extreme heat is adversely impacting the mental health of
exposed populations. However, there is a need for further research at high spatial and temporal scales that
allows for investigation of the role of potential neighborhood-level mediators (e.g., residential greenness or air
pollution) and the impacts in potentially vulnerable subgroups. In this mixed-methods study we will investigate
the impact of extreme heat on mental health among uninsured and publicly insured individuals in the City of
Boston, with a particular focus on understanding how both environmental factors and individual behavioral
patterns influence the effects of heat on mental health within this high-risk population. We will first leverage
data (2005 – 2019) from a unique emergency services program (Boston Emergency Services Team [BEST])
that services ~18,000 publicly insured and uninsured persons each year in the greater Boston area. In Aim 1,
we will assess the relationship between temperature and psychiatric emergency services encounters in the
BEST data, with particular focus to diurnal variation in exposure-response that can be leveraged to provide
additional care for these high-risk patients. In Aim 2, we will supplement this quantitative data with the
collection of semi-structured qualitative interviews with clinicians who are treating BEST patients during warm
periods (May 2024 – September 2024). The objective of these interviews is to assess BEST clinician
perspectives on the role that extreme heat plays in mental illness, as well as the feasibility of proposed
interventions within the BEST population. We will also identify key resources needed by clinicians to support
patients who may not have access to traditional protective measures (such as in-home air conditioning) in
managing their mental health during periods of extreme heat. This focus on clinical perspectives is a critical
innovation of this project, as work on climate change and health is often purely epidemiological in nature and
thus misses opportunities for effective intervention to support the health of climate-affected populations.
Finally, in Aim 3, we will quantify the potential for heterogeneity in the temperature-mental health relationship
using the BEST data. We will focus specifically on important individual indicators of vulnerability (including age,
sex, race/ethnicity, and experiencing homelessness), as well as neighborhood-level features such as air
pollution, the built environment / urban greenspace, and the presence of existing interventions (e.g., cooling
centers) intending to reduce the health impacts of extreme heat in the greater Boston area. The findings from
Aim 3 will complement the qualitative data produced in Aim 2 to provide a fuller understanding of the factors
that contribute to mental health impacts of extreme heat, ranging from social and behavioral to environmental
determinants. Overall, this study will provide crucial information to support this high-risk population in the
context of extreme heat and global climate change."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is the 3rd most common cause of cancer-related
death in the United States. This dismal outcome is in part due to the lack of understanding of
the unique pathology of PDA that includes pronounced epithelial plasticity and evolution of an
extensive reactive fibroinflammatory stroma. We have discovered an unusual cell type within
preneoplasia and neoplasia known as the metaplastic tuft cell (MTC), which has been proposed
to act as both a tumor initiating cell and as a chemosensory cell that drives the
fibroinflammatory host response. Normal tuft cells are found in normal glandular tissues and are
marked by the expression of the microtubule kinase DCLK1. There they sample the luminal
environment and respond to signals by modifying the Type 2 immune response. While there are
no tuft cells found in the normal pancreas, they arise in a transdifferentiation event to become
part of the metaplastic and neoplastic epithelium during oncogenesis or tissue injury. Besides
their chemosensory function, they have been hypothesized to be a tumor initiating progenitor
cell. In order to definitively determine the origins and functions of the metaplastic tuft cell, we
have created a dual recombinase driven mouse model of pancreatic neoplasia combined with
an inducible Cre recombinase that specifically targets MTCs that will allow us to alternatively
trace and target the metaplastic tuft cells independent of neoplastic transformation in vivo. We
have also devised human and mouse organoid culture systems that preserve tuft cell
differentiation, so that we can study their genesis, fate and chemosensory function in more
detail. Together, these tools will be used to rigorously determine the function of the metaplastic
tuft cell and whether manipulating their functions can be used to treat pancreatic cancer."

Microbial communities are dynamic and are influenced by a broad suite of biotic and abiotic factors.
One of the most important factors providing structure to microbiomes are direct interactions among

our ability to engineer microbial communities. Bacteriocins are molecules produced by bacterial cells
that are thought to specifically target different strains of the same species or closely related species.
Tailocins are a subset of bacteriocins coopted from phage tails, which are durable, possess highly
specific killing activities, maintain one-hit-one-kill dynamics, and appear to be effective prophylactic
treatments for preventing bacterial invasion of plants. The Baltrus lab has broadly characterized a class
of phage derived bacteriocins produced by the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae as well as other
Pseudomonads, and we show that the host range of some of these molecules is broader than originally
thought in that they can target some human pathogens that are often found associated with plants.
Specifically, we have discovered that Pseudomonas sp. 43A maintains tailocin-like killing activity
specifically against E. coli O157:H7 and not against a variety of other E. coli or Salmonella strains.
Experiments within this proposal will confirm and characterize the genetic basis of this tailocin-like
killing of E. coli O157:H7. Overall, experiments within this proposal could allow for fine scale
engineering to enable tailocins to specifically and effectively target human pathogens associated with
plants while avoiding off target effects associated with other agricultural antimicrobial treatments."
10791742,"This is a new application for an Interdisciplinary Pulmonary Training Program T32, the Duke Program of Training
in Pulmonary ReSearch to Promote, Engage and Retain Academic Researchers (PROSPER), submitted under
a multiple PI plan. This program provides the opportunity for diverse, exceptional postdoctoral MD and PhD
trainees to acquire state-of-the-art knowledge and research skills in independent investigation into the
pathogenesis, treatments and outcomes of lung diseases. PROSPER is a fresh start for a program that has been
centered in the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine at Duke University for 36 years and
founded on basic and clinical biomedical research approaches. PROSPER includes carefully selected,
exceptional senior mentors from the Department of Medicine and Departments of Biostatistics, Bioengineering,
Cell Biology, Pathology, Population Health Sciences, Psychiatry, Surgery, and the School of the Environment.
We also include early career scientists to serve as emerging mentors to provide our trainees with most relevant,
clinically- and scientifically-sound mentorship. Over the last 15 years, nearly 75% of our trainees continued in
research-oriented careers, and many of them became independently funded pulmonary scientists. Prior
successes notwithstanding, we identified critical areas for improvement, as a result of which we propose this
new program with expanded recruitment efforts to attract talented PhD trainees, in addition to typical MD
trainees, from relevant graduate schools at Duke and other leading universities. In addition, in PROSPER, we
commit to increasing diversity of our trainees, thus began making concerted efforts in recruitment and retention
of trainees from underrepresented minority backgrounds. We establish formal Internal and External Advisory
Boards, comprised of experienced Duke mentors and leading pulmonary scientists, and create a formal review
and feedback structure, which includes perspectives of internal advisors, external advisors, trainees, and the
NIH program officers. We establish rigorous accountability structures for the development of research, academic
career, and scholarship skills. These requirements include: to establish a mentoring committee, to create an
individual development plan, to conduct rigorous research project(s), to write and submit several manuscripts,
to present at professional gatherings, and to draft an individual career development grant by the conclusion of
training. Each trainee will also participate in a structured didactic training program, including formal coursework,
divisional seminars, lectures from distinguished invited speakers, and career development workshops designed
to expand and deepen trainees’ scientific background. Our goal is to prepare the next generation of pulmonary
scientists by providing each trainee with an individualized system of supports, which include thoughtful
mentorship, research experience, didactic learning, career development skills, scholarship, and networking, so
they can successfully establish research careers and obtain independent funding in a highly competitive
environment."

Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS) is a group of inherited autosomal recessive disorders caused by genetic
mutations that alter the trafficking of lysosomal-related organelles/vesicles. In patients with HPS-1 and HPS-4
subtypes, pulmonary fibrosis develops in the fourth or fifth decade of life, and is the major cause of morbidity
and mortality. Although the genetic alterations that underlie HPS are well defined, the mechanisms that mediate
the development of pulmonary fibrosis have not been elucidated. As a result, therapeutic targets that can be
manipulated to control the development of pulmonary fibrosis in HPS have not been described.
Chitinase 3-like 1(CHI3L1) is the prototypic chitinase-like protein. Studies from our laboratory and others
demonstrated that circulating levels of CHI3L1 are 3-fold higher in individuals with HPS-1 and HPS-4, and other
forms of pulmonary fibrosis compared to controls and that they correlate with disease severity. Our studies to
define CHI3L1 receptors revealed that CHI3L1 regulates cellular injury and repair responses in various cell types
via multiple receptors or co-receptors, including IL-13Rα2 (and its co-receptor TMEM219), and CRTH2
(Chemoattractant Receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th2 cells). Our preliminary studies further
highlight the importance of the CHI3L1 axis as a major contributor to the augmented fibroproliferative repair in
HPS: 1) CRTH2-positive Type II innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are increased in the lungs of HPS mouse models
of lung fibrosis; 2) the interaction of CHI3L1 with CRTH2 on these cells mediates fibroblast activation and
fibroproliferation; 3) the development of fibrosis is due to defective BLOC-3 dependent trafficking of Galectin-3
(Gal-3) in fibroblasts; and 4) intracellular accumulation of Gal-3 drives fibroproliferative repair by inhibiting
fibroblast apoptosis and by increasing fibroblast proliferation and myofibroblast transformation. Thus, additional
investigations of the roles of CHI3L1 and its receptors in HPS-associated lung disease are warranted. We
hypothesize that CHI3L1-CRTH2 axis leads to increased ILC2 accumulation, and Gal-3 production/accumulation
in fibroblasts in HPS lung disease, and that targeting the moieties in this pathway will result in effective therapies.
Experiments proposed in this project will investigate CHI3L1 biology in pale ear mouse models of pulmonary
fibrosis with phenotypes similar to human HPS disease. These studies will define the cellular and molecular
mechanisms of CHI3L1 receptor system, and whether CHI3L1 and its receptor systems are plausible targets to

10791826,"The neurodegenerative diseases – Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), Parkinson’s Disease (PD), frontotemporal
dementia (FTD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and others – together constitute one of the most significant
unmet challenges in human health, affecting greater than 50 million people worldwide with no treatments to slow or stop progression. With the advent of the genomewide association study (GWAS) in 2005, and the subsequent
identification of hundreds of common variant risk factors for AD, PD, FTD, and ALS, we have many loci that may
translate into new targets for therapeutic intervention. To date, however, few mechanistic studies have been
performed as follow-up to these GWAS-generated leads. One exception to this general rule has been with
respect to the 7p21 locus we and others reported in 2010 to confer risk for the AD-related dementia FTD. In the
first five years of this R01, we used a combination of computational and bench-based approaches to definitively
establish the expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) relationship between GWAS-identified single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) and expression of the target gene TMEM106B. We furthermore defined the causal
genetic variant at this locus, its CTCF-based mechanism for altering expression of TMEM106B, and the
deleterious effects on lysosomal pathways of altering TMEM106B expression. We coupled these mechanistic
experiments with investigations of the genetic modifier effects of TMEM106B genotype in FTD due to C9orf72
hexanucleotide expansions. Thus, through our work and the work of others, the field has gained an
understanding of the pathways through which genetic risk at 7p21 is conferred, and the groups of patients in
which targeting of TMEM106B may be viable therapeutically. In this RO1 renewal application, we propose to
deepen our understanding of TMEM106B biology, investigating its influence in multiple neurodegenerative
diseases, and elucidating its role in lysosomal function and cellular health.
Specific Aim 1: Determine whether genetic modifier effects of the GWAS-identified FTD common variant
risk factor TMEM106B extend across a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases. We will investigate
TMEM106B genotype effects in >1300 longitudinally-followed AD, PD, FTD, and ALS patients. We will determine
whether TMEM106B acts as a genetic modifier in PD associated with GBA mutations.
Specific Aim 2: Elucidate the mechanisms by which changes in TMEM106B expression affect lysosomal-
autophagy pathway function and cellular health. We will follow-up preliminary work demonstrating that
TMEM106B may affect autophagosome-lysosome fusion through a VAMP8-Syntaxin17 pathway. We will
investigate TMEM106B-induced changes in lysosomal acidification through direct measurement of ion
conductances across the lysosomal membrane and investigations of TMEM106B’s role in assembly of the

10791829,"Metabolons are non-covalent complexes of enzymes that play crucial roles in primary and secondary
metabolism. Such supramolecular complexes carry out a series of reactions in a pathway while protecting
intermediates from diffusion into the bulk phase and promoting product channeling. This mechanism increases
reaction efficiency and fidelity and protects labile intermediates. Although there has been tremendous progress
in understanding the structures and functions of soluble metabolons, the study of membrane-associated
metabolons is complicated by the extra dimensions added by membrane and lipidic substrates. A membrane-
associated metabolon of significance is the eukaryotic dolichol pathway in which the dolichol diphosphate-linked
glycan for asparagine (N)-linked of glycosylation is assembled. Bacterial glycoproteins in the epsilon
proteobacteria including Campylobacter, are also generated through stepwise, membrane-associated
pathways and culminate in the biosynthesis of important virulence-associated glycoproteins. Study of the
bacterial pathway and extensive genomic information from Campylobacter, providing data on the enzymes and
substrates in vivo across >50 discrete genera, adds a important dimension to our studies as operon order is
highly conserved but, glycan output varies and there is considerable sequence divergence. Development of
systematic approaches for investigating the pgl pathways will provide a valuable template for future studies on
important multistep biological processes occurring at the membrane.
 Despite the importance of such pathways, our understanding of how the enzymes function, and whether as
a metabolon or in a distributed fashion with diffusion of substrates/products between enzymes is limited. It is
also unknown how the GT-B fold, common to most pgl glycosyltransferases (GTs) leads to function and substrate
selectivity, as the similarity of active-site residues does not lead to a clear structure/function view, or account for
the impact of the interaction of enzymes or substrates with the membrane. The research has three aims. In Aim
1, PglA, J, H1 and H2 from the C. concisus glycan assembly metabolon will be investigated via X-ray structure
determination of complexes with UDP-sugar and PrenPP-sugar substrates, ligand binding and kinetic analysis,
MD simulations and membrane association determination in model membrane (styrene maleic acid
lipoparticles). In Aim 2, we will predict and validate protein-protein and protein-membrane interactions, determine
the effect of protein-protein interactions on pathway flux and test for product channeling. Aim 3 will generate
sequence similarity networks and genome neighborhood diagrams to identify orthologs in divergent species to
identify structural elements governing membrane and membrane-bound substrate interactions. We will also
investigate why a GT-A fold (GT) is recruited to perform the ultimate biosynthetic step.
 If successful, the research will provide a newly proposed paradigm for specificity established by membrane
interactions and the approaches to enable study of other membrane-resident biosynthesis pathways."

The University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center (UWCCC), its leadership, and its faculty are driven by a
mission to defeat cancer through rapid application of groundbreaking research in cancer education, prevention
and treatment. Embedded in the UWCCC's strategic plan are tactics for expanding a modern research platform
inclusive of a comprehensive clinical research program with exemplary data management and clinical trial
prioritization as well as scientific oversight and leadership. The UWCCC NCTN LAPs multi-disciplinary team
remains an integral component of this strategic initiative and collaborates with key faculty to support innovative
translational research for next generation clinical trials within the NCI's National Clinical Trials Network.
Since 1974, UWCCC faculty have functioned as leaders in the development of the NCI cancer cooperative group
program; first within ECOG and then with RTOG, ACOSOG and GOG in the early 2000s. As the NCI and its
NCTN transitioned to a centralized infrastructure in 2014, the UWCCC designed a LAPS team of collaborative
principal investigators by combining the existing broad scientific leadership from three of the primary cooperative
groups (ECOG/ACRIN, NRG and ALLIANCE). This multi-disciplinary approach with leaders from Surgical,
Medical, Radiation and Gynecologic Oncology, facilitated an innovative governance structure to provide
leadership and oversight in prioritization of Phase II/III clinical trials, timely trial activation and robust accrual as
well as the development of junior faculty interested in oncologic clinical research. In the four years since our last
grant submission, the UWCCC LAPS team has provided support for the important genomically-directed clinical
trials as well as those with a focus on advanced imaging, while strengthening our Cancer Center's infrastructure.
This UG1 application seeks support for continuing the NCTN activities within the UWCCC. This partnership
remains an important mechanism for providing a diverse population of cancer patients with novel treatment
approaches, as well as a means for providing resources and support for existing and new leaders within the

Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), commonly caused by a ruptured aneurysm, carries a high rate of disability
and death. Preclinical studies demonstrate SAH induces dysregulation of the cerebrovasculature, which con-
tributes to early brain injury and delayed cerebral ischemia. Few treatment options currently exist for SAH
patients, making it imperative to identify novel therapies to improve outcomes following SAH. Cannabidiol
(CBD) has gained attention for its potential therapeutic properties and widespread mechanistic actions. First
utilized for the treatment of pain, preclinical studies demonstrate CBD has anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective,
and vascular stabilization properties in experimental models of injury. However, understanding of the effects
of CBD on blood vessels in the brain is limited, and no studies have directly investigated CBD as a treatment
for SAH, representing critical gaps in knowledge. The overall objectives of this application are to determine
the therapeutic potential of CBD for SAH injury and identify processes by which CBD improves vascular
health. The central hypothesis is that daily CBD treatment improves vascular integrity to increase cerebral
blood flow (CBF) and prevent DCI, thereby improving functional outcomes and mortality following SAH. The
rationale for this project is that determination of CBD’s therapeutic efficacy in SAH will generate a strong
scientific framework from which new strategies for SAH therapy can be developed. The central hypothesis
will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Determine CBD’s efficacy to improve functional outcomes and
mortality following SAH, and 2) Identify the impact of CBD therapy on cerebral microvessel pathology follow-
ing SAH. Under the first aim, multiple doses of CBD will be tested in mice following SAH injury (endovascular
perforation) to determine the most effective dose that improves sensory/motor function and cognitive out-
comes, and reduces mortality. For the second aim, the efficacy of CBD to reduce the development of vaso-
spasm and blood-brain barrier leakage will be investigated utilizing intravital microscopy and ex vivo micro-
Computed Tomography imaging. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it proposes
the use of a compound with a wide variety of molecular targets capable of ameliorating multiple aspects of
SAH pathology. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to provide scientific justification
for the continued mechanistic investigation of CBD as a much-needed novel therapeutic for SAH patients,
advancing the field of stroke research."
10791788,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of the Mouse Phenome Project is to support biomedical research by delivering a widely-accessed
and highly functional data repository for well-documented disease relevant phenotypic data from
heterogeneous mouse populations. Human studies of complex traits have revealed genetic loci that are
involved in disease and other conditions. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that prohibitively large
sample sizes are required to identify genome-wide significant variants. Studying model organisms can provide
insight, aid in prioritization, and facilitate translation of research findings into practice. To be truly effective in
using model organism studies in the interpretation of human disease, it is essential that data be available to
end-user biologists and computational scientists in a useable form that assures quality, interpretability and
validity. These needs are best captured under the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reuseable)
data standard. We will advance the Mouse Phenome Database (MPD) in response to emerging needs of the
research community to annotate data, make it available through a FAIR-compliant public repository, and
provide tools that enable users to visualize, analyze, and download primary and summary data. We propose to
optimize our development to address problems of cross-species and cross-population data integration and
analysis. Our objectives are to provide a central repository for data, documentation, and protocols, offering a
unique and important venue for investigators needing to make their data public; to continually refine and
develop tools and features to best locate, present, and analyze those datasets; and to maintain, enhance, and
promote this resource to further enable quantitative, standardized and predictive phenotype studies and, in turn
facilitate new scientific advances. We will achieve these objectives in three Specific Aims. Aim 1: We will
expand the data repository with extensive complex trait data and upgrade the MPD system to provide a
persistent, FAIR compliant, public repository for primary mouse phenotypic data. Aim 2: We will enhance the
MPD tool set to enable multivariate biostatistical and statistical genetics analysis along with cross-species and
cross-population data integration and analysis. Aim 3: We will provide essential documentation, and ensure
outreach, education, and training opportunities. Impact: The proposed efforts will help maximize the value of
these data and provide the traceability and scientific rigor required for extension and translation. Completion of
the proposed work will result in a powerful, interoperable system for public access to and analysis of mouse
phenotype data and will ultimately provide researchers a seamless experience for the extrapolation of model
organism genetics data to human genetic variation."
10791869,"Abstract: Controlling the autoimmune inflammation in type 1 diabetes (T1D) has proven difficult.
Currently there are clinical trials to attempt controlling T1D that are having only marginal impact.
Desired primary outcomes include increasing of C-peptide, as a marker for beta cell restoration,
decrease insulin requirements, decreases in HbA1c, as a measure of systemic inflammation and
maintenance of peripheral blood lymphocyte counts. Current therapies have slowed C-peptide
loss marginally but not halted or reversed loss. None of the other primary goals have yet been
achieved in any of the current clinical trials. We created a novel approach to control pathogenesis
in T1D using a small peptide to modulate CD40 mediated inflammation. We completed pre-clinical
studies in mice that include toxicology/pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic studies on a peptide
that prevents diabetes onset in NOD mice and reverses hyperglycemia in 60% of diabetic NOD
mice. We have begun a veterinary clinical trial generating data that show, unlike current clinical
trial treatments, this approach increases C-peptide over time, reduces, by up to 90%, insulin
requirements, reduces glycated fructosamine, the veterinary equivalent of HbA1c, and does not
cause immune suppression or lymphocyte loss. We were granted a “Safe-to-Proceed” notice from
the FDA to begin Phase 1a/1b clinical trials in humans using this drug. This grant application is to
perform mechanism of action studies on this drug. We hypothesize that the drug, KGYY15
(OPT101 for FDA) binds to beta cell CD40 to prevent beta cell damage. We further hypothesize
that KGYY15 binds to peripheral blood T cells (TH40 cells specifically defined by us), B cells and
macrophages/dendritic cells to tolerize thus preventing further damage. We also will explore
developing this drug approach for islet transplants. Successful completion of this grant will provide
important information about how this drug works specifically during T1D."
10791870,"We aim to understand biomembrane structure/function with the aid of a lab-achieved breakthrough in
control of membrane phospholipid and sphingolipid composition via cyclodextrin-catalyzed lipid
exchange. Lipid exchange is generally efficient (80-100%), and permits preparation of lipid vesicles
mimicking natural membranes closely in terms of lipid asymmetry, the difference in the lipid
composition in the inner and outer lipid monolayers (leaflets). The lab has now extended this method to
control lipid composition of plasma membrane outer leaflets in mammalian cells (without harming
them), and without disturbing membrane sterol. The method is being applied to solve long-standing
issues of membrane organization and function. We proposed in 1994 what remains the working model:
that membrane domains form in cells due to segregation of sphingolipid-cholesterol rich liquid ordered
(Lo) domains from unsaturated lipid rich liquid disordered domains. In the last grant period, using lipid
exchange to prepare asymmetric membranes, we found how lipid structure in each leaflet controls
when there is overall induction or suppression of Lo domains. With physiologically-relevant lipids, we
found that Lo domain formation is greatly enhanced by loss of lipid asymmetry, and confirmed this is
also true in natural plasma membrane vesicles. This is important because transient loss of lipid
asymmetry occurs during signal transduction. In the next grant period we propose to test the hypothesis
that Lo domain formation is induced by loss of lipid asymmetry in intact cells by using red blood cells,
which have a number of advantages including only a single membrane, known lipid asymmetry, known
methods to control lipid asymmetry in situ, and facile use for lipid exchange. We will then extend
studies to metabolically-active cells to see if loss of lipid asymmetry stabilizes Lo domains during
antibody-triggered signal transduction in immune RBL-2H3 cells, and defining the importance of Lo
domains by exchange using lipids that enhance or inhibit Lo domain formation. In the last grant period
we also used lipid exchange to show the ability to form Lo domains is necessary and sufficient for a
lipid to support insulin receptor function. We proposed the hypothesis that localization in Lo domain,
which are thick, decreases insulin receptor transmembrane helix tilt, activating autophosphorylation.
We will test this hypothesis by defining receptor domain localization before and after activation, and by
mutations that lengthen or shorten its transmembrane segment, to see if predicted activity changes are
observed. We also propose to test a novel competition assay for defining receptor domain localization.
Finally, we propose to extend lipid exchange to membrane enveloped viruses. A range of lipids will be
exchanged into the envelope of pseudovirus with SARS CoV-2 spike or VSV-G proteins to see how
viral lipids/domains modulate cellular uptake. These studies may help design of improved vaccines."

Excessive weight gain leading to obesity is common during the early phases of pediatric acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL) treatment, and results in higher risk of relapse, lower event-free survival rates, and more adverse
events during treatment. Yet, effective preventive interventions for excessive weight gain during the early phases
of ALL treatment are lacking. Aligned with NCI priorities, the long-term objective of this work is to mitigate weight-
related disparities in pediatric cancer treatment outcomes. Guided by the ORBIT Model of Behavioral
Intervention Development, the goal of this proposal is to adapt, refine, and pilot test a family-based health
promotion intervention that aims to curb excessive weight gain among youth with ALL by integrating support for
family coping with stress during the early phases of ALL treatment. Given that ALL is most prevalent in young
children, families play an essential role in shaping youth’s health behaviors during treatment. In Aim 1a, the PI
and her mentorship team will adapt an existing family-based health promotion intervention (NOURISH-T) to meet
the specific needs of families of youth in the early phases of ALL treatment (NOURISH-ALL). Adaptations will
incorporate family systems and cognitive behavioral intervention components to support healthy family coping
with diagnosis and treatment stress. Additional, patient-centered adaptations regarding intervention content and
delivery will be informed by semi-structured input from families and youth with ALL (n=10 at minimum) and
multidisciplinary clinical experts (n=6 at minimum) until thematic saturation is reached. In Aim 1b, the
investigative team will iteratively refine the NOURISH-ALL intervention through sequential testing with families
and youth with ALL (n=5 at minimum) and structured participant feedback. Intervention refinement will be
ongoing until >80% feasibility and acceptability ratings are achieved or until n=10 families complete the
intervention and provide structured feedback. In Aim 2, the adapted and refined NOURISH-ALL intervention will
be pilot tested in a single arm trial with 20 newly recruited families of youth in the early phases of ALL treatment.
The research team will assess key components of participant engagement to inform the future, fully powered
clinical trial, including recruitment rate, retention at treatment completion, and intended intervention dose
received. By incorporating tailored strategies for health promotion during the early phases of ALL treatment, the
proposed study seeks to shift clinical practice paradigms to prevent weight-related disparities in treatment
outcomes. This K08 will provide opportunities for the PI to acquire skills and knowledge in: (1) the early phases
of ALL treatment, (2) scientific adaptation and refinement of family-based behavior change interventions, and (3)
the conduct of clinical trials focused on behavior change interventions. The research and career development
plan, supported by a multidisciplinary team of experts in a rich academic environment, will support the PI’s
transition to independence as a cancer control scientist who possesses the skills and expertise needed to adapt
evidence-based behavior change interventions to the pediatric cancer treatment context."

Normal auditory cortex (ACX) function is crucial for speech and language perception. Many disorders that
involve ACX, such as Central Auditory Processing Disorders (CAPD), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and
tinnitus are thought to be due to abnormal brain wiring. Moreover, influences on the developing brain interact
with each other, e.g., early trauma or drug exposure can alter early sensory processing, resulting in wiring
deficits. Thus, correcting disorders would seem to require the ability to rewire the brain. An understanding of
brain development and the emergence of sensory function is needed to do so.
 Sensory experience, especially during early “critical periods,” sculpts connections in the young brain,
leading to altered functional responses and functional representation of sensory stimuli, e.g., sounds in the
brain. Manipulation or replacement of sensory experience (e.g., by cochlear implants) after the critical period
does not lead to successful functional recovery. We recently discovered that sensory experience, even before
the traditional “critical period,” can alter circuits associated with subplate neurons in the developing cortex.
Thus, sensory experience in this “pre-critical period,” which in humans occurs in utero, might fundamentally
shape ACX organization and sound processing, as well as influence mechanisms during the later “classic
critical period” within layer 4.
 We have shown that the earliest sound-responsive neurons in ACX are located in the subplate, an
enigmatic, deep cortical layer. Subplate neurons (SPNs) are mainly absent in adults, highlighting their
developmental role. SPNs are more numerous in primates than in other species. Thus, some SPNs may be an
evolutionary addition enabling complex brain function. Lesioning SPNs in visual and somatosensory cortex
alters cortical development, thus SPNs seem essential to development. We have found that ACX SPNs
receive thalamic inputs and project to cortical layer 4 before the onset of low-threshold hearing. Moreover, our
recent work established that SPN circuits are disrupted in deafness, and neurodevelopmental disorders.
However, a role for SPN activity in the development of ACX has yet to be established.
 As a step towards promoting functional recovery from early sensory disruptions or injury, we will investigate
i) how sound stimuli are processed by SPNs; iii) how dysfunction of specific SPN circuits leads to altered ACX
wiring; and iii) how SPNs modulate both spontaneous and sound-evoked cortical activity. To achieve our aims,
we will utilize state-of-the-art in vivo imaging and stimulation techniques.
 Our studies will elucidate processes underlying ACX development and contribute to understanding the
pathophysiology of many disorders, e.g., deafness, CAPD, ASD, and language impairments. Moreover, our
work will inform new treatments and how existing treatments must be modified to consider these changes.

 Component A Core Surveillance
Project Abstract
The purpose of the Oklahoma Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) is to
collect state-specific, population-based data on maternal and child health (MCH) indicators of
high scientific quality that can inform programs and policies related to maternal and infant
health. The overall goal of PRAMS is to reduce maternal and infant morbidity and mortality by
collecting information that can be used to inform
 • Maternal and infant health programs
 • Health policies
 • Maternal behaviors
The CDC began PRAMS in 1987. Oklahoma is one of four original PRAMS sites and is one of
only three sites to have continuous data collection for over 30 years.
Long Term Objectives
Oklahoma PRAMS provides data for a variety of MCH issues. The goal of the study is to reduce
the prevalence of maternal and infant morbidity and mortality. PRAMS can accomplish this by
providing on-going, state-wide preconception, pregnancy, and postpartum specific data. No
other state-wide study focuses on the pregnancy and postpartum experience, making PRAMS a
unique and necessary data source for the state.
Research Design and Methods
PRAMS contacts new mothers two to six months after delivering a live birth. The sample is
drawn from the Oklahoma live birth registry. The PRAMS Project utilizes a mixed mode
surveillance system, meaning respondents are sent up to three mail survey packets, followed by
telephone contact for nonrespondents. Oklahoma stratifies by maternal race, oversampling
African American, American Indian and Hispanic mothers. A response rate of 55% in all strata is
required in order to weight the data to the annual birth cohort. Mail packets consist of the
PRAMS questionnaire and return envelope, an informed consent sheet, a resource directory, an
incentive (Mail 1 only), and a reward sheet (listing several items mothers may choose from for
completing the survey). Telephone respondents are also offered a choice of rewards. Incentives
and rewards are used to maximize participation in the study."
10816449,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Currently there are no known treatments that slow or prevent Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative
diseases, and the molecular mechanisms that underlie the progression of these diseases are poorly
understood. Our broad goal is to address critical problems in macromolecular structure determination of
disease-relevant conformations of Aβ and tau prions and associated protein regulatory complexes in order to
advance mechanistic understanding of prion propagation and guide novel therapeutic approaches. We will
achieve this goal using high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) methods and: (1) Develop affinity
capture methods on cryo-EM grids for extracting specific filaments from tissue for structure determination; (2)
Determine cryo-EM structures of Aβ and tau fibril conformations derived from in vitro assembly and mouse
models and compare with those determined from human tissue; and (3) Determine mechanisms and
interactions by the Hsp70 molecular chaperone machinery that regulate prion propagation, ubiquitination, and
clearance. With these goals we will identify the structural basis for amyloid fibrils that develop during disease
and uncover key chaperone regulatory processes critical for quality control and clearance of proteins that form
toxic amyloids."
10816450,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Our broad goal is to contribute to a molecular understanding of neurodegenerative processes, such as prion
propagation and clearance. We propose to achieve this goal by determining the structures of aggregation-related
complexes, including Hsp70-CHIP-tau complex, TREM2 complexes, and 0N4R tau, at near-atomic resolution.
In addition, we propose to characterize the native cellular environment of TREM2, thus bridging the gap between
atomic-resolution complex models and the cellular scale. The target complexes have been largely refractive to
traditional structural biology approaches. Therefore, we will apply integrative structure determination based on
sparse, noisy, and ambiguous data largely produced by the consortium, using a variety of different experimental
methods, including electron microscopy, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, chemical cross-
linking with mass spectrometry, soft X-ray tomography, and many others. Structural models will be produced by
satisfying all the data simultaneously, using our Integrative Modeling Platform (IMP) software. The models will
be used to rationalize the existing experimental data and propose new experiments, such as assessing the
phenotypes of relevant point mutations."

sponsor at least 1 pilot project/year for community-engaged projects."
10816603,"Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) continues to be a devastating disease in the United States and many
other countries with the global mortality estimated to exceed 0.7 million per year. Chronic ethanol
consumption results in lipid accumulation in hepatocytes and their organelle stress leading to
inflammation and fibrosis in the progression of ALD. The crosstalk between hepatocytes and non-
parenchymal cells - including hepatic macrophages (HMs) and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) - is
crucial to this process. However, the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways involved in
the crosstalk between lipid overloaded hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells, remain
incompletely understood. In particular, the mechanisms by which this crosstalk facilitates or
regulates a transition from chronic asymptomatic alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) to fatal alcoholic
hepatitis (AH) is a central issue for designing efficacious novel treatments for this devastating
disease. While focused on the investigation of cell-to-cell communication we recently revealed
that damaged hepatocytes release extracellular vesicles (EVs) and these EVs circulate in the
blood in mouse models of ALD. EVs are efficiently internalized into target cells and transfer their
cargo including miRNAs. The later is a key mechanism by which encapsulated miRNAs in EVs
(EV-miRNAs) serve as “functional extracellular RNAs” to regulate protein translation in target
cells. EVs also contain sterile danger signal known as damage-associated molecular patterns
(DAMPs). We found that EVs derived from hepatocytes from AH mice are enriched in
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that contribute to activation of an inflammatory process. Further, our
pathway analysis of RNA-seq data comparing AH vs. preceding chronic (c)ASH mouse livers,
identifies EV as one of the most significantly upregulated pathways. Based on these results, we
propose the central hypothesis that EVs with a quantitatively and qualitatively distinct cargo are
released from damaged hepatocytes in AH vs. preceding cASH to induce unique cellular crosstalk
in the genesis of the AH pathologic phenotype. We also hypothesize that plasma EV analysis
serves as a liquid liver biopsy providing a barcode for diagnosis and staging of ALD severity. To
investigate these hypotheses our proposal has the following SPECIFIC AIMS. 1) Determine the
role of EVs and their cargo derived from hepatocytes as barcodes for a transition from
asymptomatic cASH to AH in murine models and human ALD. 2) Dissect the mechanisms
involved in EV-mediated cell-to-cell communication in the cASH to AH transition. To address
these central issues, we have put together a MPI investigative team with expertise in EV biology,
ALD pathology, development of unique animal models, human ALD, and RNA therapeutics."
10919852,"Project Summary
 This R01 project proposes to test a developmentally informed, mechanistic model of the relations between
social media (SoMe) use and social anxiety symptoms (SA) in adolescence, examining attention perturbations
and sleep as key variables that impact risk. There is a steep increase in both SoMe use and SA in
adolescence. Although total self-reported time spent using SoMe has been associated with SA in adolescence,
findings are mixed and the literature suffers from well-documented assessment and design limitations.
Consequently, “little is known about the mechanisms by which SoMe use may impact risk” (RFA-MH-23-115).
There is a critical need for longitudinal research using sophisticated approaches to assess SoMe use and test
a mechanistic model of its influence on SA in adolescents. This project responds directly to that need.
 Guided by developmental cognitive neuroscience, our model posits perturbed attention to social content
and key features of sleep disturbance (poor perceived sleep quality and poor sleep efficiency) as central
variables on the path from SoMe use to SA. Attention acts as a gatekeeper through which social information is
selected for processing, thus shaping how adolescents experience their social world. Exciting data from
members of our team document that perturbed attention to social content is related to higher levels of SA and
sleep disturbance. Additional data document that SoMe use, especially at bedtime, is related to sleep
disturbance and sleep disturbance is related to SA in adolescence. Hispanic/Latine adolescents are particularly
impacted, as they experience anxiety and sleep disturbance at higher rates and are more likely to report using
SoMe “almost constantly,” compared with other ethnic groups.
 Together, these data position us to provide the first test of a developmentally informed, mechanistic model
wherein: bedtime SoMe use predicts SA and sleep disturbance (Aim 1) -- when adolescents show perturbed
attention to social content (i.e., moderation) (Aim 2) -- and sleep disturbance mediates the relationship
between SoMe use and SA (Aim 3). We will test this model in 252 biologically male/female, predominately
(75%) Hispanic/Latine adolescents ages 13-17 years, using an accelerated longitudinal design, assessing
adolescents four times over 18 months. Addressing assessment limitations that characterize prior work, we will
use passive sensing and ecological momentary assessment to characterize the timing, location, and behaviors
of SoMe use; established eye-tracking paradigms to measure attention to social content; and subjective (daily
diary) and objective (actigraphy) methods to measure sleep disturbance.
 This project will provide a rigorous test of a mechanistic model of the escalation of SA in adolescents. It
also will identify modifiable targets (features of SoMe use, sleep, and attention) that we would pursue in future
projects to prevent the escalation of social anxiety symptom severity in adolescence."
10828455,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Different people facing similar situations make different choices, and different choices result in
divergent life trajectories. Despite the pervasive impact on an individual’s life, the neural basis of
idiosyncratic decision-making remains largely unknown. Beginning to address this important topic,
we recently characterized idiosyncratic choice behavior quantitatively and identified a posterior
network comprised of the cingulate cortex, posterior parietal cortex, and striatum in which the
idiosyncratic choice biases are likely processed, transmitted, and integrated with other decision
variables. The posterior network imbuing idiosyncrasy might operate in parallel to the well-known
frontal network for rule- and value-based decision-making and the sensorimotor network for
stimulus-response association, all of which dynamically contribute to the final choice. However,
the detailed circuit mechanisms in the posterior network have yet to be discovered. We propose
a series of experiments in mice to elaborate information flows and processing in the posterior
network, utilizing well-established in-lab tools including behavior modeling, anterograde- and
retrograde-transsynaptic labeling, optogenetics, and two-photon imaging. Understanding the
neural circuits governing the moment-by-moment idiosyncratic history bias will shed light on the
neural origins of idiosyncratic decisions. Furthermore, life-interfering, maladaptive choice
behavior might be in part a manifestation of extremely deviated idiosyncratic bias, thus elaborating
the less known posterior network may bring new insights into pathological decision-making in
neurological conditions such as aging, dementia, and addiction."
10816783,"Project Summary
Up to 70% of manual wheelchair users experience shoulder pain, and as many as 90% develop pathologies like
rotator cuff tendinopathies and glenohumeral instability. This can have profound negative effects on quality of
life through reduced participation in everyday activities and can increase the lifetime risk of secondary medical
conditions like cardiovascular disease through reductions in physical activity. Yet, clinical guidelines for the
preservation of upper limb function in manual wheelchair users are only applicable to users with adult-onset
disabilities, and do not account for sex. As a result of this gap in knowledge, pain begins in adolescence and
increases significantly during the transition to adulthood in users with pediatric-onset disabilities. In addition, the
increase in pain during this period is far greater for females than males, even when accounting for years of
wheelchair use. Our central hypothesis is that this sex-related divergence in pain is precipitated by sex-specific
musculoskeletal adaptions to wheelchair use in childhood and adolescence. During this period of life, females
experience far lower upper extremity muscle and bone growth velocities and a shorter window in which to adapt
to wheelchair use. Moreover, musculoskeletal adaptations are driven by the mechanical demands one
experiences. We have evidence that wheelchair use is far more demanding of upper extremity musculature for
females than males, even when accounting for individual size. We will test our central hypothesis by establishing
the relationships between sex-specific adaptations to (Aim 1) glenohumeral muscle morphology, (Aim 2) scapula
shape, and (Aim 3) scapular kinematics and pain, while accounting for years of wheelchair use and arm
dominance. Our approach will leverage bilateral magnetic resonance imaging to determine the influence of sex
and wheelchair use in childhood and adolescence on the balance of glenohumeral musculature and the shape
of the glenoid and acromion, advanced biomechanical modeling to determine adaptations to scapular kinematics
at rest and during humerothoracic elevation and wheelchair propulsion, and patient-reported outcomes to
quantify shoulder pain and pain interference. We expect to reveal sex-specific musculoskeletal adaptations to
wheelchair use in childhood and adolescence associated with pain that can be immediately addressed with
established rehabilitation paradigms including strengthening exercise and motor training. Moreover, the results
of the proposed research will provide foundational knowledge for the development of sex-specific wheelchair
use guidelines for pain prevention. Finally, we expect to uncover potential mechanisms underlying the
development of glenohumeral instability and rotator cuff pathologies. By determining the etiology of shoulder
pain with consideration for sex, we hope to increase equity in the prevention and rehabilitation of secondary
musculoskeletal conditions associated with manual wheelchair use."
10824282,"Summary/Abstract
Aberrant development of the multipotent neural crest (NC) cells can result in some of the most common
birth defects called neurocristopathies, including malformations of craniofacial structures, dental tissues,
and the peripheral nervous system. In humans, mutations in the RNA helicase DDX3 cause intellectual
disability with multiple potential neurocristopathies; however, the function of DDX3 in NC development is
unknown. In Xenopus tropicalis, a highly tractable model for studying NC development, depletion of DDX3
downregulates the AKT kinase activity and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, leading to reduced NC induction.
The goal of this application is to elucidate how DDX3 and downstream signaling molecules function in NC
induction. The central hypothesis is that DDX3 induces the NC through a downstream gene regulatory
network, whose components are critical for normal NC induction. This application has three specific aims.
The first aim will determine how DDX3 induces the NC, with a focus on understanding how DDX3 activates
AKT. The second aim will investigate the roles of AKT in NC induction downstream of DDX3, and the
hypothesis to be tested is that AKT functions through Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. The third aim will test the
feasibility of using X. tropicalis as a model to study how diseases-associated human mutations in DDX3
and downstream genes affect cell signaling and NC induction. Outcomes of this proposed research should
provide new insight into the fundamental mechanisms governing NC induction, as well as the etiology of
human neurocristopathies caused by mutations in multiple genes in this network."

10824307,"ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY
The world has recently witnessed unprecedented advances in biomedical research and discovery. We have
observed technological miracles including isolation of human embryonic stem cells, completion of the human
genome project, generation of new heart valves from stem cells and the discovery of novel genetic risk factors
through genome-wide screens. With the rapid development and application of new technologies to biomedical
research, enormous progress has been made in understanding basic human biology and disease. However,
the translation of this knowledge to the discovery, development and optimal use of pharmacological therapies
has not kept pace. This slow progress can be attributed, primarily, to two factors: 1) a severe shortage of well
trained, qualified clinical pharmacology investigators, nationally, who can fulfill this need for translational
research and, 2) a marked contraction of training opportunities within the U.S.
At UCSF, we are keenly aware of what has been described as an “overwhelming mandate” to train the next
generation of clinical pharmacologist researchers. We are uniquely positioned to fulfill the growing and evolving
needs of adult and pediatric clinical pharmacology through the recruitment of a diverse and highly motivated
pool of M.D., Pharm.D. and Ph.D. trainees into our research-intensive Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics
Postdoctoral Training Program (https://pharm.ucsf.edu/cpt). For the past 54 years, the UCSF Clinical
Pharmacology Training program has consistently produced clinical pharmacologists of the highest caliber. In
this competing renewal application, we propose to continue and extend our highly successful clinical
pharmacology-training program, which includes seven two-year fellowship positions. Our fellows will be
educated in translational research – from basic science to clinical application – through our mentored research
training, didactic coursework and participation in a biweekly seminar series. Faculty mentors in the program,
committed to training our fellows, have high impact, NIH-funded research programs and teaching careers. Drs.
Burchard and Floren lead the program. Dr. Burchard, M.D., M.P.H., studies genetics and pharmacogenetics in
minority children. Dr. Burchard served as an advisor to the Director for the National Institutes of Health's “All of
Us” initiative. Dr. Floren, PharmD., is the Director of Advanced Scientific and Clinical Training for the UCSF
PharmD program.
Our research strengths include pediatric pharmacology, vulnerable populations, pharmacogenomics,
pharmacometrics, systems pharmacology and regulatory sciences. Our program will help create a well-trained
and diverse group of clinical-scientist investigators who will serve as tomorrow's leaders in clinical
pharmacology research and practice in academia as well as the pharmaceutical, biotechnology industries and
regulatory agencies."
10824499,"Program Summary
While we have learned a tremendous amount about human immune responses in recent years, many studies of
human immunology examine the system in a static state of health or disease. However, to truly define how a
complex system works, dissect the components that interact with each other under dynamic conditions, and gain
actionable knowledge of how the system effectively resets (or not) during and after disease, the system must be
perturbed. Thus, the central theme of this Program is that by capturing perturbations of the human
immune system and performing high resolution studies of key immune cell types and immune reactions
in flux we will gain new mechanistic insights into the functional connections driving productive or
pathological immune responses in humans. To address this central theme, we propose 3 Projects to: 1) test
the hypothesis that post acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) is associated with incomplete clearance of SARS-
CoV-2 and/or reactivation of latent viruses, resulting in chronic inflammation and durable immune dysregulation;
2) utilize chronic and cured HCV infection as a human model system for defining the impact of both natural and
precision immune perturbation on overall host fitness and health; and 3) define mechanisms of human vaccine-
induced immune memory using precision immune perturbation through PD-1 pathway blockade. Each Project
captures a key immune perturbation with a major common feature of known timing and nature of the perturbation
including viral infection leading to PASC (Project 1), viral cure in a long-standing chronic infection (Project 2),
and vaccination in the context of precision disruption of a single immune pathway, PD-1 (Project 3). As a result,
we “capture the human experiment” through focused profiling of the human immune system around these key
perturbations. These Projects are supported by an administrative Core and two scientific Cores that enable
robust human cohort development, management and sample collection (Core B) and high dimensional, highly
standardized, large scale and integrated immune landscape profiling for all patients and subjects studied (Core
C). This latter effort will allow common themes, immunotypes and cross-disease immune mechanisms to be
identified and leverages the interactions across our interconnected Projects. Thus, this highly interactive IPSG
CCHI U19 Program will allow us to make major mechanistic advances in our understanding of human antiviral
immunity."

Infections due to Gram-negative bacteria and mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) pose a serious threat to human
health. These organisms produce especially complex cell envelopes consisting of a double layer of membranes
that are essential for survival. This cell envelope also functions as a physical barrier to block entry of many
classes of antibiotics and thereby render them ineffective. This research is directed towards understanding the
structure and function of three protein transporters responsible for cell envelope assembly. Each of these
transporters represents one of the three major transporter families, namely ABC transporters, MOPS
transporters, and RND transporters. To understand how these transporters move their complex glycolipid cargo,
biochemical and structural studies will be undertaken. Intermediates and inhibitors of transport and assembly of
will be characterized structurally, biochemically, and in cells. A better understanding of these proteins’ roles in
cell envelope assembly will lead to new therapies to treat resistant infections."

The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are a group of incurable neurodegenerative storage disorders
primarily affecting the brain and the retina of children and young adults, leading to dementia, blindness, epilepsy,
and early death, with a prevalence of approximately 1.5 to nine per million population (1.3 to 7 per 100,000 live
births). The infantile onset form CLN1 disease is caused by mutations in the CLN1/PPT1 gene, which codes for
the lysosomal enzyme palmitoyl-protein thioesterase-1 (PPT1) resulting in a reduction or absence of enzyme
activity. CLN1 disease usually presents between 6 and 24 months of age and there are 2-3 children with this
form identified each year and currently 24 known children with CLN1 in the US, 11 in Brazil and at least 10 in
the UK (with likely many more undiagnosed). There are currently no treatments available other than palliative
therapies and the disease is fatal. Human recombinant PPT1 (rhPPT1) expressed in CHO cells has been
previously reported to modify disease phenotypes following a single intrathecal (IT) and intravenous (IV)
administration in PPT1 deficient mice (Ppt1-/-). After successful completion of our Phase I SBIR in which we
exceeded our milestones monthly intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of rhPPT1 produced statistically
significant treatment effects in Ppt1-/- mice, such as rescue of more than 60% PPT1 enzyme activity decreased
secondary enzyme levels, decreased the loss of neurons in all regions of brain and spinal cord and improved
gait and rotarod results. The CLN1 ERT data clearly pointed to ICV dosing as ideal for future studies, which is
also a preferred route according to physicians. Our Phase II SBIR has enabled us to 1. Prepare our quality
documents, 2 identify a CDMO (STC Biologics) who has manufactured our GLP quality protein for preIND toxicity
studies in rat. 3. Submitted a preIND request to the FDA (with the assistance of RTI International,). We now
propose in this project 1. production of GMP protein (with STC Biologics), 2. Continued development of quality
procedures, 3. Prepare a clinical trial protocol (with assistance from CTI Clinical Trial Services, Inc.), 4 and
submit an IND (with assistance from RTI). These collaborations will enable us to cost effectively and more rapidly
translate this potential treatment to the clinic that can potentially save the lives of children living with this
devastating disease. We have already obtained an Orphan Drug Designation and rare pediatric disease
designation from the FDA for rhPPT1 as a biological product for a “rare pediatric disease” which offers several
benefits in future upon FDA approval, including marketing exclusivity for 7 years and the potential to obtain a
rare pediatric disease voucher and thus provide a return on investment (current value ~$100 M). We are engaged
with CLN1 families and we are now well positioned to continue the development of this potential treatment for a
devastating disease. This proposed work would bring us closer to a clinical trial. Our work on developing rhPPT1
as an ERT for CLN1 would position us well to work on further rare diseases in future and grow CPI. There is an
important role to bring treatments to patients with ultra-rare diseases as illustrated by other much larger
companies such as Biomarin and Ultragenyx who we aspire to emulate."

Cervical cancer affects the lives of half a million women worldwide each year, and over half of these women die.
Preventative solutions that are widely used in wealthy countries are not practical for use in medically underserved
regions due to sophisticated technologies and expertise needed to sustain these solutions. Thus, alternative
protocols that employ low-cost, simple-to-use technologies are needed to prevent cervical cancer. Our vision is
to develop high quality, low-cost interventions that will be effective in low and middle-income countries (LMICs)
to address shortcomings of current solutions for cervical cancer prevention. The Calla Health Foundation is
developing the tools needed to help meet the WHO metrics for cervical cancer elimination in the next 100 years.
Under fast track SBIR funding (R44CA240019), we are developing tools for point-of-care screening and
diagnosis. However, screening and diagnosis alone will not lead to decreases in cervical cancer mortality if
access to point-of-care treatment remains limited. While Loop Electrosurgical Excision procedure (LEEP) is the
most widely used treatment in high-income settings, cryotherapy is more commonly used in LMICs. Recently,
thermocoagulation has gained acceptance for ablation of cervical pre-cancer as it does not require consumables
(continuous supply of pressurized liquid nitrogen for cryotherapy) or a stable power supply (for LEEP). However,
thermocoagulation is limited by bioheat transfer and therefore the depth of necrosis it can achieve. To develop
a complementary therapeutic approach to thermocoagulation, the goal of our Phase I SBIR grant was to establish
an injectable low-cost ablative therapy based on controlled delivery of a ubiquitous agent, ethanol to treat cervical
pre-cancer. Specifically, we developed a new formulation of ethanol using a polymer called ethyl cellulose (EC)
to act as a slow-release gel limiting off target toxicity and an automated injector to reliably deliver ethanol into
the region of interest. Moving forward, the goal of our Phase II SBIR grant is to develop beta versions of the
automated injector, develop packaging and quality control metrics for EC-ethanol, and assess if a combinatorial
therapy in which sequential EC-ethanol ablation and thermocoagulation are applied to the cervix is synergistic
and enhances efficacy. This work will include the following specific aims: 1) evaluate usability and repeatability
of hand-held injectors for EC-ethanol delivery; 2) establish EC-ethanol stability and potency testing plan and
release criteria; 3) assess safety and efficacy of sequential EC-ethanol ablation and thermocoagulation
compared to monotherapies; and 4) assess clinical workflow and population health impact of monotherapies and
combinatorial therapy."

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a lifelong inflammatory condition of the gut in which modulation of the
immune system is the major therapeutic strategy. However, despite development of novel therapies, including
antibodies to TNF and IL-12/IL-23p40, and inhibitors of T cell gut homing such as vedolizumab and ozanimod,
only 30-50% of patients experience a sustained therapeutic benefit. Orphagen is developing first-in-class specific
small molecule antagonists to the retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RAR) that regulate the induction of both the gut
homing integrin 47 and a second gut homing receptor, CCR9, during T cell activation. Our preliminary data
confirm that inhibition of retinoic acid signaling through RAR is a promising therapeutic approach to IBD. First,
we showed that a probe RAR antagonist significantly improved gut histology in a mouse naïve T cell transfer
colitis model and inhibited 47 expression and accumulation of inflammatory T cells in the colonic lamina
propria of Citrobacter rodentium-infected mice. Second, with a more specific RAR lead antagonist, OR-812, an
orally bioavailable new chemical entity designed at Orphagen, we showed in a mouse model of oral antigen
stimulation that the induction of 47 and CCR9 in activated T cells is almost completely blocked at very low
doses, <0.4 mg/kg; thus, antagonism of RAR by OR-812 potently blocks the induction of two key gut homing
factors simultaneously. Third, OR-812 was well tolerated in a 14-day toxicity study in mice at 30 mg/kg following
significant systemic exposure, indicating a strong safety margin for this new drug class.
Our major objectives are to qualify OR-812 as a candidate for preclinical development, confirming efficacy in a
murine model of colitis, scaling up sufficient compound for safety studies, and executing an exploratory safety
study in a non-rodent species. In Aim 1, we evaluate the efficacy and potency of OR-812 in a mouse naïve T
cell transfer colitis model. In Aim 2, we develop improved methods for synthesis of OR-812 and ultimately
prepare a 500g batch for the non-rodent exploratory safety studies. In Aim 3, we identify a non-rodent species
for in vivo toxicology studies based on in vitro metabolism of OR-812 in comparison to human and confirm
adequate pharmacokinetics and bioavailability in the selected non-rodent species. In Aim 4, we conduct a 7-day
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) safety study in the non-rodent species and, based on this, conduct a 14-day
dose-range finding safety study in non-rodents with extensive assessment of target organ histopathology to
determine the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL). The overall goal of these non-GLP safety studies is
to identify potential toxicities and confirm a preliminary safety margin for OR-812 based on the efficacious dose
in a mouse colitis model. These investigations, if satisfactory, would prepare OR-812 for its next stage: regulated
animal safety and chemical manufacturing studies appropriate for submission of an Investigational New Drug
(IND) application to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a novel drug class for treatment of IBD."

Bacteria require fatty acids for a variety of biological functions, including the construction of phospholipids.
Staphylococcus aureus, like other bacteria, synthesize fatty acids using a fatty acid biosynthesis pathway
referred to as FASII, but can also scavenge fatty acids from the environment using the recently described fatty
acid kinase (Fak) pathway. In addition to fatty acid biosynthesis and acquisition, it is common for bacteria to
degrade fatty acids using fatty acid degradation (Fad) enzymes. Bacteria can degrade fatty acids for energy
production (known as b-oxidation) but can also degrade fatty acids to alter the length of the acyl chain. S. aureus
has been thought to not possess the capacity to degrade or perform b-oxidation of fatty acids. This is due, in
part, to the absence of a key crotonase enzyme. This is surprising considering that S. aureus is annotated to
encode all the other necessary Fad enzymes, though their function has not been confirmed. During RNAseq
studies of the Fak pathway, we observed an ~17-fold increased expression of the group of genes annotated to
encode Fad proteins when the Fak pathway was inactivated. Indeed, no crotonase enzyme was apparent,
though all the other Fad functionalities were annotated. Using bioinformatics, we identified a putative crotonase
enzyme in S. aureus that we now call FadB based on nomenclature in other systems. When co-expressed with
S. aureus FadA, FadB can functionally complement an E. coli fadA and fadB mutants on minimal media with
fatty acid as a sole carbon source. This demonstrates that 1) S. aureus FadB can substitute for the E. coli
crotonase activity-containing enzyme, and 2) S. aureus does possess a complete Fad pathway and likely can
degrade fatty acids. We seek to characterize the regulation of this pathway, demonstrate the saFadA and saFadB
proteins form a complex like the E. coli proteins, and demonstrate the functionality of the S. aureus Fad pathway
in three Specific Aims.
 Aim 1 will identify regulatory proteins of the Fad operon. Aim 2 determines if the S. aureus FadA and FadB
proteins form a complex. In addition, Aim 3 examines the ability for S. aureus to degrade fatty acids and use
them as alternative carbon sources using controlled expression of the Fad genes using a combination of 13C-
labeled fatty acids with mass spectrometry and growth assays.
 The Fad-encoding genes have been identified in a variety of transcriptomic studies but have remained
unstudied. This is likely due to the known dogma in the field that S. aureus does not possess a complete Fad
pathway and cannot degrade fatty acids. We anticipate that the completion of this application will redefine fatty
acid metabolism in S. aureus and determine for the first time that S. aureus can degrade fatty acids. This will
change how the field understands S. aureus metabolism and will set the stage for future applications examining
the role of this pathway in cell physiology and pathogenesis."

The kidney transplant waitlist comprises 83% of the U.S. organ transplant waitlist. Yet, for every 5 patients who die
or become too sick for transplantation, 3 kidneys are discarded. Organ preservation quality is linked to graft lifespan
with kidneys having only 50% graft survival after 10 years. Extending preservation to a week, or longer, would enable
nationwide (theoretically global) donor-recipient matching, allowing many good quality kidneys not transplanted today
(e.g., extended criteria donor kidneys) to be offered to the patients who most need them. Kidney preservation times
of 7-9 days would enable translation of clinical immune tolerance induction, and avoidance of life-long
immunosuppression requirements, from contexts of living donor transplantation to deceased organ donation
(80% of all transplants), improving the lives of transplant recipients, and saving the healthcare system ~ $100 million
dollars each year. Improved and extended preservation technology, with off-the-shelf availability, can enhance
screening for transmissible diseases/malignancies, allow assessment of organ quality, drug/gene therapies for graft
function augmenting, and support xeno-transplantation research. Moreover, 3D slices from preserved kidneys
unmatched for transplant, have wide applicability in drug safety/efficacy testing, and a large variety of research topics.
 Building on the project's Phase I feasibility success that demonstrated unprecedented (rabbit) kidney
preservation for up to 14 days, we here scale-up this new technology to develop a (i) nature-inspired and
(ii) machine perfusion enabled, subzero solution to dramatically extend preservation times of human and
porcine (xeno) kidneys. High subzero temperatures (-12 to -20°C) applied using an ultra-stable equilibrium
approach are combined with stress tolerance enhancement and metabolic suppression strategies. Optimized
machine perfusion protocols, 3D combinatorial high throughput screening with precision cut kidney slices,
advanced µCT imaging, whole human kidney, and porcine survival auto transplantation models are employed.
Based upon the significant Phase I achievements and our team's organ preservation experience, we develop
technologies and strategies in Phase II for enhanced human kidney equilibrium ice-free high subzero banking
via: 1) multi-temperature multi-step machine perfusion platform supportive of pre-conditioning protocols, for clinical
scale kidney effective and uniform permeation, at all renal compartmental levels, with (i) biocompatible cryostasis
cocktails formulated on the basis of toxicity neutralization and mutual dilution principles, and (ii) effective
revival/reconditioning protocols for enhanced reperfusion; 2) validation of (168-216h) 7-9 days preservation in
complete absence of ice with (iii) cross country shipping of stored kidneys, and clinical practices of ex vivo renal
perfusion; 3) porcine model kidney orthotopic transplantation with long-term survival, with and without “anywhere
in the world” shipping, and 4) randomized physiologic ex vivo assessment trial of 7-9 days stored human kidneys.
 This Phase II sets the stage for logistical model of centralized centers of excellence for preservation and
assessment, enabling vastly improved clinical outcomes and patients' access across the country, and world."

Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of pneumonia, acute otitis media (ear infection), and
meningitis in the United States. S. pneumoniae remains an important pathogen despite a vaccine and
effective antibiotic treatments due to increasing levels of antibiotic resistance and vaccine evasion
through serotype switching. Virulence in S. pneumoniae is mediated by a complex gene regulatory
program that is only partially understood. In many bacteria, trans-acting small non-coding RNAs
(sRNAs) play key roles in regulating stress and virulence responses. While many sRNAs have been
identified in S. pneumoniae via high-throughput sequencing studies, biological function has been
assigned to only a few. The goal of this exploratory proposal is to identify the mRNA targets for sRNA
candidates in S. pneumoniae, focusing specifically on those implicated in mediating virulence. We have
two aims to reach this goal: First, we will determine the mRNA targets for a set of prioritized sRNA
candidates implicated in S. pneumoniae virulence during mouse infections. Second, we will
characterize the entire S. pneumoniae sRNA:mRNA interaction network. To achieve the first aim, we
will use MS2-afinity purification coupled with RNA sequencing (MAPS) to identify mRNA targets for a
set of prioritized sRNAs associated with fitness defects in mouse infections. MAPS tags each sRNA
individually to allow specific capture of sRNA targets, but allows unbiased identification of potential
mRNA partners via high-throughput sequencing of the captured RNAs. This approach will be combined
with computational tools that predict the targets of sRNAs using thermodynamic properties. A set of 5-
10 of the most promising mRNA targets identified from the combined approaches will be assessed
using reporter gene assays to validate the sRNA impact on gene expression. To achieve the second
aim, we will use RIL-seq, a technique which captures mRNA:sRNA pairing through crosslinking
followed by ligation. Subsequent sequencing identifies chimeric reads corresponding two interacting
RNAs. To enrich for sRNA:mRNA pairs, a FLAG-tagged RNA-binding protein partner to
immunoprecipitated the sRNAs. In S. pneumoniae, which lacks an RNA chaperone, we will use Cbf1,
an exonuclease shown to process sRNAs, to enrich our population. Taken together, our two aims will
identify mRNA targets for sRNA candidates associated with virulence, and move the field from
cataloging sRNA presence toward identification of sRNA biological function, and thus therapeutic
intervention."
10821072,"Title: Two-way Magnetic Resonance Tuning Nanoprobe Enhanced Subtraction Imaging for Precision
Diagnosis of Brain Metastasis
Project Summary/Abstract
Metastasis from systemic cancers to the brain is a leading cause of cancer mortality. The current diagnostic
method is sensitive only to larger tumors when therapeutic options are limited. Visualizing early brain metastases
by non-invasive imaging approaches with high sensitivity and spatial resolution followed by timely treatment is
crucially important to reduce their high mortality rate. While effective interventions (e.g., surgery, radiation,
targeted therapy, and immunotherapy) strongly depend on our ability to detect brain metastases at an early
stage, imaging small brain metastases hidden in a large population of normal cells presents a unique challenge.
It is essential to design novel imaging approaches to detect small brain metastases with the highest possible
tumor-to-normal tissue ratios (TNRs). The goal of this application is to develop a new molecular nanoprobe with
activatable magnetic resonance contrast integrated with a new computational subtraction approach to improve
the TNR of imaging for small brain metastases. We recently developed a new two-way magnetic resonance
tuning (TMRET) nanoprobe with dually activatable T1&T2 magnetic resonance signals coupled with dual-contrast
enhanced subtraction imaging (DESI) to dramatically enhance contrast in targeted tissues and suppress the
background signal from normal tissue. This integrated platform could sensitively detect very small tumors in the
brain by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models with a TNR >10. We also
developed a Sequential Targeting In CrosslinKing (STICK) nano-delivery strategy to “stick in” central nervous
system (CNS) tumors and metastases, which will be applied to our TMRET nanoplatform to enhance its specific
delivery to brain metastases. In this project, we will develop novel blood-brain barrier (BBB)-traversing and deep
tumor-penetrating TMRET (bt-TMRET) nanoprobes with superior TNR for sensitive and specific detection of
brain metastases. The STICK strategy will be used to improve the CNS pharmacokinetics (PK) of TMRET
nanoprobes by pHe-cleavable crosslinkers to maximize the time window for transcytosis through the BBB. Our
STICK strategy will further enhance the efficiency of BBB traversal by manipulation of glucose transporter 1
(GLUT1) on the BBB by optimization of the polyvalent interaction of nanoprobes with GLUT1 via fine-tuning the
surface targeting moieties. The STICK strategy optimizes the pH-responsive size transformation for improved
tumor tissue penetration and sialic acid-targeting selectivity for enhanced tumor cell specificity. The MRI signal
can be turned ON specifically at the brain metastases after BBB traversal and tumor penetration via size
transformation in acidic tumor microenvironment. Our hypothesis is that the proposed nanoprobes can improve
the TNR for MRI detection of small brain metastases through a synergized strategy of background suppression,
signal amplification via deep penetration and specific targeting in brain metastases and activation at tumor sites,
and DESI technology will further enhance the TNR. This new imaging platform is expected to improve cancer
detection in the clinic and serve as a great tool for biomarker detection in preclinical research."

Maternal-child synchrony describes the temporal associations between maternal and child social and
physiological states, often occurring within maternal-child interactions. Maternal-child synchrony is a critical
component of child development that emerges during pregnancy and is present throughout childhood. The
quality of maternal-child synchrony is associated with future social development, making it an important
construct to understand. Given its developmental importance, it is critical to characterize maternal-child
synchrony in specific subgroups vulnerable to weakened maternal-child synchrony. It is well established that
maternal-child physiological synchrony decreases in clinical samples, such as when mothers are experiencing
mental health challenges (e.g., anxiety, depression) and when children themselves belong to at-risk groups
(e.g., prematurity), but this association is poorly understood in neurodevelopmental disorders, like fragile X
syndrome (FXS). FXS is a rare, monogenetic disorder, characterized by deficits in attention, social
development, and emotional regulation. These deficits have been attributed to physiological hyperarousal. This
“hyperarousal hypothesis” of FXS has been demonstrated via cardiac activity, particularly when indexed by
respiratory sinus arrythmia (RSA), wherein individuals with FXS have shown depressed RSA (thereby
indicating physiological arousal) when neurotypically (NT) developing individuals have shown higher RSA. As
an inherited disorder, mothers of children with FXS typically have the fragile X premutation (FXp). Women with
FXp demonstrate atypical physiological arousal indexed by lower RSA as well, and they experience elevated
anxiety, depression, and stress. Collectively, in FXS, these child and maternal phenotypic factors (i.e., clinical
status, atypical RSA) coalesce into vulnerability to disrupted maternal-child RSA synchrony. Yet, no studies
have examined maternal-child RSA synchrony in FXS or focused on infancy. Just as maternal-child synchrony
is influenced by the phenotypes of the dyadic partners, mother-child interactions are influenced by contextual
factors that surround the child, such as parental stress and familial relationships; this important contextual
influence has also been absent from the FXS maternal-child synchrony literature. Therefore, the over-arching
aim of this F31 is to examine maternal-child RSA synchrony in 12-month-old males with FXS (nFXS = 25),
contrasted against male infants with neurotypical development (NT; nNT = 25) at baseline (Aim 1a) and during a
standardized mother-child free play interaction task (Aim 2b). I will identify how contextual variables (i.e.,
parental stress, family relationships) differentially impact both baseline maternal-child RSA synchrony (Aim 1b)
and maternal-child RSA synchrony during the mother-child free play task (Aim 2b) in both groups, as well as
how behavioral synchrony impacts maternal-child RSA synchrony during the mother-child free play task (Aim
2c) across groups."
10821125,"Project Summary/Abstract
 As a chronic neuropsychiatric disease, addiction is associated with specific molecular and
functional neuronal plasticity changes that are triggered by repeated drug exposure leading to
persistent changes in neuronal function and ultimately behavior. One powerful mechanism that
may underlie aspects of this persistence is epigenetics. Epigenetics (i.e., modulation of gene
expression that occurs through altered chromatin structure without changes to the DNA sequence
itself) has been shown to establish stable changes in cell function. These stable changes in cell
function can give rise to remarkable changes at many levels of observation (e.g., neuronal
plasticity, behavior). Currently, we still know very little about the epigenetic mechanisms that
establish the persistence characteristic of drug-seeking behavior and whether such mechanisms
may also be involved in reinstatement, or other relapse-like behaviors. Here, we will focus on the
role of the medial habenula (MHb) in cocaine-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior.
Recent studies have begun to implicate the MHb in cocaine-associated behaviors, yet the role of
the MHb in regulating reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior remains largely unknown. In fact,
the MHb is rarely included in reward circuitry diagrams. Our recent findings demonstrate that the
MHb is engaged by cocaine-primed reinstatement and the activity of choline acetyltransferase
(ChAT) expressing neurons in the MHb is sufficient to drive reinstatement (15). These results
suggest that the MHb is a powerful regulator of relapse-like behaviors, which has important
implications for understanding the reward pathways in the brain related to relapse. We will examine
the role of a histone deacetylase, called HDAC3 in MHb-dependent reinstatement of drug-seeking.
HDAC3 is a key negative regulator of memory formation and associative plasticity, which functions
by repressing the expression of important downstream target genes. HDAC3 is highly expressed in
the MHb within ChAT expressing neurons, indicating that HDAC3 (an pivotal regulator of memory
processes) has a central role in behaviors associated with MHb-dependent reinstatement. In this
proposal, we will test the central hypothesis that the MHb is a key regulator of reinstatement of
cocaine- seeking behavior and does so in an HDAC3-dependent manner. Successful completion of
these studies will demonstrate the key nature of the MHb in reinstatement, identify the
physiological processes in the MHb responding to cocaine, and identify key epigenetic regulators
of MHb function."

Impaired social communication is a major feature of common neurodevelopmental disorders like autism
spectrum disorder. Nevertheless, cellular mechanisms underlying the development of affected brain networks
remain uncertain, despite the potential to inspire novel diagnostics and pharmacological interventions. Hence,
this represents a key area of need in modern biomedical research. This career development proposal utilizes
an emerging invertebrate model organism, the clonal raider ant, to investigate cellular mechanisms of
neurodevelopment in olfactory brain circuits uniquely adapted for communication.
Ants have evolved a remarkable capacity for chemical communication. Information is encoded by large arrays
of pheromones exuded by dedicated exocrine glands and is received and processed by highly advanced
olfactory systems. With approximately 500 olfactory glomeruli, the clonal raider ant antennal lobe (AL) is more
complex than any other known insect and is evocative of the olfactory bulb in the brain of mammals
(Drosophila have only ~50 AL glomeruli, for reference). Previous work in our lab suggests the evolution of
sociality in ants may have coincided with unique neurodevelopmental logic in the AL supportive of this
complexity. Over three aims, this project investigates early neuronal activity in pupal ant olfactory sensory
neurons (OSNs) and its significance for the normal wiring of brain circuits in adults. First, Aim 1 utilizes
GCaMP-expressing transgenic ants and in vivo two-photon microscopy to characterize spontaneous neuronal
activity in the OSNs of clonal raider ant pupae. In Aim 2, OSN activity is manipulated throughout development
using novel transgenic ant lines and the impact of these perturbations on olfactory circuit structure is
investigated. In Aim 3, optogenetic tools are used to disrupt OSN activity during an isolated period of
widespread synaptogenesis in mature ant pupae and the effect on neuropil volume is examined."

In this R13 application we request support for the 3rd Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on “Neurobiology
of Drug Addiction,” which will take place in August 2024 in Maine, USA. The objectives of this GRC are to
foster open discussion of novel research developments, build new collaborations, and propel the next
generation of both scientific advances in addiction research and addiction neuroscience researchers. To
achieve these objectives, we will pursue the following four specific aims at the meeting: 1) Provide an
international forum to brainstorm about cutting edge, multidisciplinary research at the forefront of addiction
neuroscience; 2) Introduce breakthrough neuroscientific techniques that facilitate the understanding of brain
mechanisms driving compulsive drug use and relapse; 3) Promote interactions among diverse young and
senior investigators and exchange of ideas that will shape the future directions of addiction neuroscience; and
4) Foster development of the next generation of diverse addiction researchers by encouraging the participation
of students and postdoctoral fellows who are committed to addiction research.
The conference focuses on presentations and discussions at the frontiers of addiction research. The scope of
the lectures will be confined to basic and clinical studies involving addictive drugs (including alcohol) and the
nervous system and will focus on mechanisms of compulsive drug use and relapse. The meeting will also
break down barriers to progress by uniting investigators with synergistic and complementary expertise in areas
ranging from molecular mechanisms to translational clinical research and addiction theory. The conference will
provide a forum to address the latest developments in addiction research in an open and highly interactive
GRC format, which includes formal talks interspersed with ample discussion time, poster sessions, and
informal discussion periods that cultivate communication and collaborations.
This conference setup differs from that of other meetings in the field and will provide a unique opportunity for
close interactions among investigators at all stages of their careers and among investigators with different
research approaches and cultural perspectives. Concerted efforts to support participation of students,
postdoctoral fellows, young investigators, and members of groups historically under-represented in addiction
research will nurture the growth of the next generation of addiction researchers. As in 2022, we will hold an
accompanying GRS in 2024 to provide a forum for students and postdoctoral fellows; in addition, a substantial
number of GRC talks will be delivered by early career scientists. We envision that the Neurobiology of Drug
Addiction GRC will significantly advance our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying drug
addiction and stimulate the development of novel hypotheses, research directions, and therapeutic
approaches."

The Perinatal Research Society (PRS) Young Investigator Training Workshop held the two days prior to the
PRS main-meeting, provides an opportunity for young investigators to engage with senior, established
investigators in an active learning environment. Young investigators attending the workshop receive protected
time for immersion in active writing and oral presentation, accompanied by immediate one-on-one discussion
with established investigators who have track-records of NIH funding and mentoring. The current
competitiveness of the extramural funding environment magnifies the importance of training young
investigators in the art of writing successful grant proposals and effectively communicating their research and
its impact. Each workshop is attended by 18-21 young investigators and 6-8 faculty-mentors drawn primarily
from the PRS membership. This young investigator-to-faculty mentor ratio ensures substantial interactions.
Young investigators arrive for the Workshop already having identified a project, drafted a Specific Aims page,
and identified their research mentor and funding agency. An innovative strength of our Workshop is its
immersive, active-writing and oral presentation design. Active writing is by an iterative writing process during
which each young investigator’s grant section is critiqued one-on-one by a faculty-mentor, followed by revision
and new one-on-one critique by a different faculty-mentor. Didactic instruction is used, but minimally to
introduce the functions of the sections of an NIH grant. In parallel, the elements of clear writing are applied to
oral presentations that are practiced and critiqued to improve clarity that is targeted for a diverse audience.
Impact of our Workshop is evidenced by quantitative outcomes measures (Joss-Moore et al, 2022, Reprod.
Sci.). During the current funding period, 2019-2022, 43% of workshop participants received funding following
Workshop attendance, with 19% receiving funding from NIH. Funded NIH awards include 9 K-series awards,
and 11 R-series awards. An additional 6 K-series and 11 R-series applications are pending. Another important
impact is recruitment of URM participants to the Workshop. During our current funding period, 75% of young
investigators are women and 27% of young investigators are URM. Because the Workshop is associated with
the annual PRS main-meeting, the young investigators are immersed in the PRS membership for further
networking. Outcomes show that the Workshop is impacting grant award success. This impact harmonizes
with the mission of the PRS to foster the development of the next generation of clinical, translational, and basic
scientists in the field of perinatal medicine and biology for the betterment of public health in the US."

diseases in humans ranging from relatively mild to potentially fatal. A mechanistic understanding
of growth and pathogenesis of rickettsial pathogens would potentiate therapeutic strategies to
control rickettsial disease. However, because of their obligate intracellular lifestyle and
consequent challenges in culturing and genetically manipulating these species, our
understanding of fundamental aspects of rickettsial biology is limited. Within the Rickettsia
genus, the Spotted Fever Group (SFG) includes tick-borne human pathogens that cause
diseases ranging from mild to life-threatening. Among the SFG bacteria, R. parkeri causes a
relatively mild disease and presents a tractable model for probing the biology of this group. In
the past, research leveraging a relatively small collection of transposon mutants of R. parkeri
has yielded important insights into Rickettsia pathogenesis and host interactions. Here, we
propose to expand the genetic toolkit available to study R. parkeri, generating a large-scale
transposon mutant library of R. parkeri in the R61 phase of this project and using it to gain
mechanistic insights into rickettsial growth and division in the R33 phase. In Aim 1, we will
develop and validate plasmid constructs for (1) generating transposon mutants of R. parkeri with
desired characteristics and (2) expressing genes of interest with and without tags in R. parkeri.
In Aim 2, we will generate, map, and organize a library of ~2000 transposon mutants of R.
parkeri. In the R33 phase, we will perform global analysis of growth kinetics and cell morphology
of all mutants in the transposon library in Aim 3. In Aim 4, we will leverage insights from
morphology screening to identify and characterize candidate factors that are important for
peptidoglycan cell wall hydrolysis during R. parkeri cell division. Completion of this project will
generate important genetic resources for the study of all aspects of R. parkeri biology and will
provide foundational knowledge about growth and cell division in an important tick-borne,
obligate intracellular pathogen that may aid in the design of new antibacterial therapeutic
approaches."

Naturalistic contexts provide the opportunity to study the brain and behavior in response to the ethological
problems an animal is evolutionarily designed to solve. We seek to expand the capabilities of our current
behavioral segmentation approaches to provide a more precise and comprehensive account of behavior. By
incorporating recent innovations in machine learning, segmentation approaches that can account for behavioral
dynamics at multiple timescales, and increased breadth in the sampling modalities used to classify behaviors,
we will create a toolkit that our team and others can make use of to quantify complex, spontaneous behaviors.
We will implement an analysis pipeline to capture and make use of patterns of mouse body position,
vocalizations, and arousal states. We also aim to capitalize on recent insights into the role of the gut-brain axis
in shaping behavior. After validating our acquisition and analytical approaches, we will monitor these outputs in
response to controlled, parametric environmental manipulations in two distinct, ethologically-relevant contexts:
intruder response to resident urine signals and limited access to water. The exploratory data collected in these
experiments will be vital to validating our algorithmic advances and for piloting future grant proposals.
 The foundation of this work is a diverse team approach. Our team, comprised of experts in social behavior
ethology, microbiota research information theory, and data-driven computational modeling, will take an end-to
end approach in executing this proposal. By starting with experimental design informed by all parties, we will
ensure that the resulting pipeline possesses sufficient structure and richness for meaningful analysis. the team
will help guide long-term research avenues that are both ethologically appropriate and computationally rigorous.
Lastly, we recognize that open access will greatly accelerate the validation and adoption of these technologies,
a stated aim of this RFA. Dissemination and access to our deliverables will benefit substantially from ongoing
relationships with the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center and OpenBehavior.
 The partnered hardware and software advances of Aim 1a and 1b represent the overarching goal of this
proposal, an advanced and comprehensive behavior segmentation platform. Aim 2 will interrogate temporally-
dynamic urine protein signals and Aim 3 will study how progressively increasing thirst induced through water-
restriction affect neurobehavioral measures. These contexts will be used to benchmark the broad applicability of
Aim 1 – as well as to explore the potential to address targeted research questions within these frameworks."

sound and testable hypothesis; 3) identify specific objectives, conduct controlled methodical
experiments, and develop technical expertise; 4) analyze results, derive conclusions, propose additional
experiments, and anticipate new directions; and 5) convey research findings succinctly and convincingly to
others. Responsible conduct of research and scientific rigor are key components of the training plan. STAR
program has consistently received 55 to 63 applicants annually, and in 2015 expanded to 15 positions
supported by the NIH T35 mechanism to meet growing demand from students with interest in participating in
NIH-relevant research. Students with broad interests ranging from molecular and cellular medicine, to
biomedical engineering, to vector borne diseases, to epidemiology will be trained. The program maintains 57

have access to research projects conducted not only on a variety of lab animal species (C. elegans, zebrafish,
rodents, non-human primate), but also clinical research on companion and food animals. Increasingly students
express interest in transdisciplinary “One Health” research experiences with hypotheses targeting complex
questions about disease emergence and transmission at the interface of animals, humans and their
environment. Accordingly, we have dynamically expanded our training faculty to meet student interests. The
greatest strengths of our short-term training program include the outstanding quality and motivation of our DVM
students, the strong highly collaborative multidisciplinary nature of our research programs, and student access
to translational research projects that use innovative approaches. Trainees will have access to advanced
technologies, such as epi/genomics and metabolomics, proteomics, state-of-the-art imaging, BSL3 labs,

This project is aimed at improving the health of individuals who have sickle cell disease (SCD) by defining a
potential pro-survival factor of acute chest syndrome (ACS), and exploring whether this factor can be developed
as a molecular therapeutic. ACS is the leading pulmonary complication and a common cause of premature death
in SCD. There is no specific treatment for ACS despite decades of intensive research, and so it continues to be
a major clinical problem in SCD, particularly, in Africa. We recently discovered that extracellular heme triggers
ACS in an inflammatory process involving toll-like receptor 4 signaling. A growing number of experimental,
clinical and genomics studies support this model of ACS pathogenesis in which extracellular heme triggers the
acute lung injury. In this new R01 project, we test the novel idea that children express supra-physiological levels
of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), the rate-limiting heme degradation enzyme. We posit that the high-level HO-1 in
children enhances their ability to clear excess heme from the blood circulation to improve their overall outcome
from ACS. In pilot studies, we found that replenishing HO-1 in the plasma of adult SCD mice improved ACS
survival. These prior research provide a strong rationale to understand how endogenous HO-1 production is
regulated in SCD, and to test whether a recombinant HO-1 will be efficacious in treating ACS in a preclinical
model. Thus, in Aim #1, we will quantify blood HO-1 expression in patients and transgenic mice with SCD, and
examine whether HO-1 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells is influenced by miR-494 expression
and methylation of a highly conserved CpG site in HMOX1 the HO-1 gene. We will over-express and knock-
down miR-494 in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and knock-out HO-1 activity in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells of transgenic SCD mice, to determine the direct effects of these genetic/epigenetic alterations
on HO-1 concentration in the plasma. We will perform whole genome next generation sequencing of SCD
children with extreme levels of blood HO-1 level to identify novel whole genome sequence (WGS) variants that
influence activity of this enzyme independent of age, miR-494 and HMOX1 methylation. In Aim #2, we will study
a large cohort of SCD patients in Ghana to assess for the first time whether baseline blood HO-1 level, miR-494
level, HMOX1 methylation and WGS variants influence ACS risk. In Aim #3, we will use functional genomics to
test the importance of HO-1 expression in blood cells in improving ACS survival, and test the efficacy of a novel
truncated recombinant HO-1 molecule to rescue transgenic SCD mice from ACS. Data from this project has the
potential to fundamentally change our understanding of how the body naturalizes the danger posed by circulating
heme on organ function. In addition, it may provide a mechanism to explain the markedly variable ACS outcome
in children and adults, with a tangible therapeutic strategy that can be implemented expeditiously using our novel
HO-1 biologic."
10786498,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
Guinea pigs are an exceptional mid-pipeline model for evaluation of vaccine candidates against tuberculosis
(TB) disease. Guinea pigs develop the full range of pathological disease observed in humans, where mice do
not, and are still fairly simple to house unlike nonhuman primates. Unfortunately, unlike mice or nonhuman
primates the immunological reagents for guinea pig endpoints are widely underdeveloped or non-existent. There
is a gap in resources and endpoints for guinea pig research in the TB vaccine pipeline which limits their use.
Here we propose adopting and optimizing the peripheral blood monocyte cell (PBMC)-based mycobacterial
growth inhibition assay (MGIA) for use with guinea pig samples. The MGIA has been used for humans, mice and
nonhuman primates as a surrogate efficacy endpoint which evaluates the ability of PBMC from vaccinated
subjects to control mycobacteria ex vivo. To-date, the assay has not been evaluated using guinea pig samples.
Due to the relatively low number of cells required and elimination of the need for in vivo challenge this assay
affords a more high throughput evaluation of vaccine efficacy and addresses the 3Rs of animal research:
reduction, replacement, and refinement. PBMC and autologous serum samples have been collected from control
and vaccinated guinea pigs in historical studies which are available for this project. Using these available
samples allows a reduction in the need for live animals and helps make use of existing materials. The ex vivo
challenge of the MGIA replaces the need for in vivo challenge of live animals while also refining the endpoint.
Our colleagues at Oxford University have previously demonstrated that ex vivo efficacy correlates well with in
vivo challenge and subsequent bacterial control in preclinical models. We hypothesize that PBMC and serum
from bacillus Calmette–Guérin immunized guinea pigs will better control both bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG)
and Mycobacterium tuberculosis challenge in an ex vivo co-culture than non-immunized cohorts. Furthermore,
we expect that we will be able to identify the correct cell number and challenge dose to best resolve vaccine-
mediated differences. If successful, this optimized protocol would help align the preclinical pipeline efficacy
endpoints and provide a much needed tool for the guinea pig model. We will also make use of the co-culture
supernatants to evaluate the secreted effector molecules produced and look for differences between samples
that did or did not inhibit mycobacterial growth. Further mechanistic studies will explore the role of host cell
glycolytic metabolism on subsequent control. Together, this proposal aims to develop a new core methodology
for a highly translational animal model and begins to interrogate the mechanisms behind efficacy readouts."
10792630,"Colorectal cancer (CRC), the second leading cause of death in older adults in 2019, was diagnosed in 145,600
patients and was responsible for 51,020 deaths. In the absence of metastatic disease, surgery is the standard
of care for more than 90% of CRC patients. Insight from existing literature and our preliminary studies suggest
that the most essential surgical disparities in CRC are related to race effects in surgical risk and strong hospital-
associated differences in mortality and morbidity. Significant variation in CRC surgical outcomes exists across
hospitals (e.g. mortality rates 0.6%-14.7%) with known disparities adversely affecting black patients. Black
patients have lower surgical utilization rates, worse surgical outcomes, and lower survival rates compared to
White patients. Black patients are more likely to use lower quality, lower volume hospitals for surgery, even when
a higher quality choice can be found closer to home. These disparities extend beyond race to residential setting
(e.g. rural) and other patient characteristics. Access to higher quality hospitals is a critical barrier to achieving
surgical equity across the population. Data to drive hospital selection is limited. Our preliminary studies
demonstrate that most Black patients (86%) have a higher quality hospital located within close proximity of their
home and the potential to reduce disparities by >30% with data driven referrals while improving outcomes across
populations. Existing risk stratification tools to assist in the hospital selection process lack the requisite
combination of factors to facilitate rational decision-making including: 1) disease specificity, 2) attention to
complex patient-provider interactions, 3) information on hospital quality, and 4) comparative statistics. Our
preliminary data suggest that accurate risk prediction can be performed that meet these criteria. In the proposed
study, we will refine the personalized prediction models, scale them to the national level, and develop the tools
to make statistical comparisons possible. As disparities are no longer a problem for the vulnerable alone, we
demonstrate the gains in Societal Welfare of data driven referrals using counterfactual simulation. Further, we
will use scenario testing to simulate the effects of data driven referrals on the willingness of referring providers
to trade-off convenience and reputation for enhanced quality. This information is critical to drive policy reform to
advance surgical equity. Our goal is to reduce disparities by referring older, black CRC patients to higher quality
hospitals by 1) developing personalized risk models to differentiate across hospitals (or surgeons), 2) providing
evidence to inform policies designed to incentivize data driven referrals, and 3) setting strategies to promote data
driven referrals for CRC. This pioneering work will provide 1) new methods of risk stratification, 2) an estimate
of the Societal Welfare benefits of data driven referrals for policy makers when designing new policies to minimize
surgical disparities and 3) new knowledge on physician preferences to inform interventions to promote adoption
of data driven referrals. This work will serve as a template for subsequent efforts to extend data driven referrals
across all surgically treated solid organ malignancies."
10792631,"Project Summary
 The International Registry of Werner Syndrome recruits cases of Werner syndrome (WS) and a range
of other segmental progeroid syndromes from around the world with the goal of elucidating underlying
mechanisms of accelerated aging. Detailed clinical information, the results of genetic analyses, and biological
specimens are made available to a wide range of qualified geroscientists.
 In this application, we propose to extend our previous studies to include systematic genome-wide
searches for the genetic variants responsible for the 78 progeroid cases that we have so far been unable to
genetically characterize. An additional important extension of our research agenda is to initiate translational
research that can lead to potential therapeutic agents.
 We will employ a combination of next generation sequencings, array CGH, and Sanger sequencing,
followed by confirmatory Western analysis and quantitative PCR. These approaches have successfully
identified novel pathogenic variants of WRN (a DNA helicase), LMNA (a component of nuclear structure),
POLD1 (DNA polymerase delta), SPRTN (recruiter of DNA polymerase), ERCC4 (nucleotide excision repair),
CTC1 (telomere replication), MDM2 (an inhibitor of P53) and SAMHD1 (regulation of dNTP pools). These loci
highlight major roles for genome instability, now widely accepted as one of the hallmarks of aging. We also
made progress in the identification of disease mutations that suggest other mechanisms of accelerated aging,
such as BSCL2 (lipid droplet formation) and SMAD4 (intracellular signaling of a component of SASP, TGFβ).
 As indicated above, we will pursue translational research with the potential for the development of
ameliorative therapies for our progeroid patients. Based on our previous studies, our collaborator, Dr. Yokote
Koutaro at the Japanese Werner Consortium, is evaluating the efficacy of an NAD intermediate and an mTOR
inhibitor, metformin, in WS patients. We shall begin independent studies of the effects of suppressors of
chronic inflammation, namely Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, in cultures from WS patients and controls. This
effort was motivated by our findings that SMAD4 mutant fibroblasts exhibited increased accumulation of DNA
damage and that WRN mutant fibroblasts showed elevated SMAD4 expressions and dramatically higher levels
of SASP compared to control cells, suggesting that a synergy of persistent DNA damage and inflammation
may be one of the common key mechanisms leading to the accelerated aging. Concordant experiments will
explore the effects of these novel therapeutic targets with high throughput screening of cell cultures from
patients with other progeroid syndromes. An initial small scale experiment involving siRNA screening has
revealed that siRNAs and drugs that alter the intranuclear dNTP concentration are able to modulate the cellular
disease phenotypes of POLD1 mutants. Larger scale siRNA screening will be employed to identify additional
novel relevant target pathways as well as previously unknown functional interactions of progeroid genetic loci."
10808285,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The primary goal of this research proposal is to provide Dr. O’Neil with
four years of training and research experience in implementation science and mixed-methods research
techniques to support his transition to being an independent researcher focused on improving the early
detection of breast cancer and breast cancer care more broadly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
Breast care patients from LMICs face far higher mortality that patients from the USA, in part because a lack of
screening mammography results in more than 50% being diagnosed with stage III or IV cancer. Breast cancer
screening using clinical breast exam has been shown it to be nearly as effective at detecting early BC as
mammography and capable of decreasing BC stage at diagnosis and mortality. However, screening CBE
(sCBE) has not been widely implemented in LMICs, including South Africa. Dr. O’Neil proposes to use the
Implementation Mapping process to collaboratively design and pilot a set of strategies for implementing sCBE
in the primary health centers (PHCs) of Soweto, South Africa. In Aim 1, he will engage with provider and
patient stakeholders at four participating PHCs to conduct a baseline needs assessment, identify determinants
of implementation with change objectives, select applicable strategies, and then produce implementation
materials. Determinant and strategy selection will be organized using the COM-B and behavioral wheel of
change frameworks. In Aim 2, Dr. O’Neil will conduct a feasibility pilot study of sCBE implementation in the
same four PHCs, using the strategies developed in Aim 1. This study will allow for refinement of the strategies,
and the primary outcome will compare receipt of sCBE among eligible women before and after implementation.
These results and other secondary results from the RE-AIM framework will provide preliminary data supporting
an R01 proposal for a large-scale hybrid trial measuring the effectiveness and implementation success of the
sCBE implementation package developed here. Dr. O’Neil has substantial experience studying breast cancer
care quality and barriers to care in sub-Saharan Africa. His training plan adds to that foundation by
emphasizing new skills essential to actually improving care, with formal instruction in the theories and methods
of implementation science and mixed-methods research. His mentoring team includes experts in breast cancer
clinical research, implementation science, and global oncology, who are uniquely qualified to supervise Dr.
O’Neil’s research program and to help him expand his academic global oncology network. Dr. O’Neil will also
be leveraging his longstanding and productive partnership with breast cancer researchers at the University of
Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, who will be enthusiastic collaborators in the proposed work and provide vital
support. This work will the first step towards scaling-up and studying breast cancer screening throughout South
Africa and other LMICs, a public health goal with the potential to decrease global breast cancer mortality. It will
also position Dr. O’Neil for a successful career as an independent global oncology implementation scientist."
10808825,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The burden of cancer is rising in Africa and mortality rates are high. A majority (70-80%) of patients present at
advanced stages, and cancer care incurs substantial financial costs for families and healthcare systems. Even
for potentially curable patients, effective treatment delivery is hampered by low adherence and retention in
care. In this context, patient-centered communication (PCC) offers an immediate opportunity to improve
treatment outcomes, optimize resource utilization, and alleviate suffering. PCC means responding to individual
patients’ perspectives and needs, involving patients in decision making, and providing emotional support.
Patients and clinicians in many African settings, including in Rwanda, have identified critical deficits in PCC
and have called for a cultural shift toward patient-centered care. Empowering patients through patient-reported
measures, and clinicians through communication skills training, has the potential for broadly impactful
improvements in PCC. A key barrier to progress in PCC research in African cancer care is the absence of
context-appropriate measures of communication quality. Currently, no measures of clinical communication
have been validated in an African cancer care context. This proposal addresses this gap by adapting,
validating, and piloting a patient survey of communication quality in Rwanda. Specifically, Dr. DeBoer aims to
(1) adapt an existing patient survey, the Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care (PCC-Ca), based on
input from Rwandan stakeholders; (2) establish psychometric properties of the adapted PCC patient survey in
Rwanda; and (3) conduct a feasibility pilot trial of the adapted PCC patient survey to evaluate a communication
training intervention for clinicians in Rwanda. To achieve these aims, Dr. DeBoer will leverage her existing
research partnership at Butaro Hospital in Rwanda and her prior work adapting a PCC clinician training
intervention for the Rwandan context. The proposed research will result in context-appropriate measures that
can be used to evaluate a PCC clinician training intervention in a future R01 cluster randomized trial in
Rwanda. This K08 award will support advanced training in implementation science and career development in
global oncology, organized around four training goals: (1) stakeholder-engaged research; (2) program
evaluation; (3) interventional trial design; and (4) career development in global oncology. For each goal, Dr.
DeBoer will complete coursework, fulfilling the UCSF Certificate in Implementation Science, as well as
mentored tutorials and experiential learning from research aims. An exceptional multidisciplinary team of
mentors with an optimal balance of complementary expertise will guide Dr. DeBoer in achieving her goals. This
training will position Dr. DeBoer for a successful independent research career as an implementation scientist
and leader in the emerging academic field of global oncology, advancing Dr. DeBoer’s ultimate objective of
promoting global cancer equity by improving the quality of care for patients in East Africa and beyond.

10810869,"Project Summary/Abstract
The goal of this project is to understand at the atomic level how cholesterol modulates integral membrane protein
signaling. We seek to address this question in two physiologically important biological pathways, cholesterol
homeostasis by the SREBP regulatory machinery and hormone signaling by G protein-coupled receptors
(GPCRs). The SREBP machinery centers on Scap, a membrane protein that resides in the endoplasmic
reticulum. Scap binds to the SREBP transcription factors and controls their maturation in a cholesterol-dependent
manner. There are currently no atomic structures of any vertebrate Scap, and little is known at a detailed
biophysical level about Scap's cholesterol binding or conformational changes. Like Scap, GPCRs bind ligands
(e.g. hormones, neurotransmitters, and lipids) and undergo conformational changes that trigger intracellular
signaling. Multiple GPCR X-ray structures have revealed cholesterol binding interactions, however the functional
significance of these interactions is largely unknown. We found that the CB1 cannabinoid receptor can bind
allosteric modulators at a membrane-embedded surface that overlaps with its cholesterol binding site. This
finding suggests that cholesterol may be an allosteric modulator of CB1 as well as other GPCRs. We are studying
the interactions of cholesterol with Scap and GPCRs to better understand how this essential lipid can control
diverse functions through these different membrane proteins. We will use cryo-EM to determine the atomic
structure of a full-length vertebrate Scap, either bound to its co-regulatory membrane protein Insig or a soluble
fragment of SREBP2. These structures will elucidate the architecture of this lipid-sensing machine and provide
an atomic basis for cholesterol regulation. In parallel, we will obtain the first NMR spectroscopy data and cryo-
EM structural data for GPCRs embedded in native-like phospholipid nanodiscs, with and without cholesterol.
These data will reveal whether embedded cholesterol can stabilize particular conformations of a GPCR, and
whether cholesterol interactions are maintained in G protein signaling complexes. We propose to use this diverse
array of biophysical techniques to obtain unprecedented atomic data on cholesterol regulation of these systems,
and our findings may be used to help develop drugs that modulate Scap or different GPCRs through the
membrane."
10812114,"Project Summary: NINDS recently developed the OPEN strategy to increase the percentage of
underrepresented (UR) individuals in neuroscience research. OPEN includes summer research experiences
(SREs) that target UR undergraduate students to attract and equip them for careers in neuroscience. For
nearly 40 years, the Carolina Summer Fellows Program (CSFP) in the UNC Department of pharmacology has
provided SREs for many undergraduate students, with a high level of success in retaining these students in
academic and STEM careers. Approximately six years ago, we refocused the CSFP to target UR students to
provide research experiences, establish lifelong mentorship, and build support networks. During this time, we
have trained 22 URMs through the CSFP, with students that subsequently matriculated into master's,
doctoral, and medical programs nationwide. We have built a steady pipeline of outstanding UR fellows
primarily through close partnerships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), including the
Undergraduate Health Science Academy (Morehouse College, Clark Atlanta University, and Spelman
College), North Carolina Central (NCCU) and the UNC-Greensboro MARC-U Scholars program. During the
same five-year period, the Department of Pharmacology has expanded its faculty that study
neuropharmacology and neurobiological diseases. We have also had a high interest in neuroscience research
experiences in our student applicants (~20/year). However, as CSFP has been a self-funded program, we
have not been able to meet the need in this area. Therefore, we propose to create the CSFP-Neuro program
in this application which leverages the strength of our neurological disease- and neuropharmacology-focused
faculty at UNC and our established partnerships with HBCUs and minority-serving institutions to target the
UR disparity in neuroscience research. We propose to provide undergraduates with high-quality SREs in the
neurobiology of disease with faculty in the Department of Pharmacology and the UNC Neuroscience Center.
Each of our faculty and bench mentors will receive specialized training in mentoring diverse populations
designed to foster inclusive learning environments, recognize implicit biases, and enhance cross-cultural
communication. In addition to these research experiences, we will propose scientific and career mentoring,
career development, networking activities, and professional development designed to attract them to careers
in neuroscience and provide a framework for successful entry into graduate school. Our program has a long
track record of implementing these career and professional development programs to benefit students.
Further, to increase retention of our students in neuroscience research career paths, we propose to offer
ongoing mentoring, professional development, and preparation for graduate school application after the SRE.
This multipronged approach is uniquely designed to help students in our program gain the tools, experience,
and support they need to increase their success in neuroscience research careers."
10816547,"Vertebrate animal model use is essential to answer fundamental questions and elucidate the mechanisms in
vivo through which environmental exposures may influence human disease and produce adverse human
health outcomes. Diverse animal models, such as zebrafish, medaka fish, mouse, rat, rabbit, guinea pig, vole,
xenopus, domestic animal (dogs, pigs, sheep, etc.) and others, along with their genetically engineered
counterparts, represent powerful in vivo approaches to link molecular mechanisms to pathologic lesions
(disrupted organ/tissue function) and toxic effects. Animal models remain the gold standard for studying these
effects of environmental toxicants on development, cancer, reproduction, organ toxicity, and neurological and
endocrine systems. These approaches are powerful because in vivo model organisms operate in a systems
biology framework integrating all levels of biological organization - biomolecule, pathway, cell, tissue, organ,
and organism - and inform us of potential adverse human health outcomes. Understanding these adverse
effects requires expert pathologic evaluation of the affected tissue/organ/cells. To fill this need, the mission of
the Comparative Pathology Core (CPC) is to provide CHHE member scientists dedicated access to cost-free

10816549,"ABSTRACT- COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT CORE:
To foster relationships between the CHHE and communities in North Carolina, the Community Engagement
Core (CEC) will lead efforts on collaborative dialogue among researchers, educators, and citizens. Particular
attention will be given to deepening established relationships and forging new partnerships with vulnerable
communities throughout the eastern portion of the state, with a specific focus on our partner communities in
Durham, Raleigh, and Wilmington. We envision an inclusive and comprehensive approach to our engagement
efforts. The CEC will (1) exchange important information with vulnerable groups and our target audiences (to
raise awareness of environmental health issues and increase environmental health literacy), (2) gather
concerns and suggestions on environmental exposures faced by our partner communities in their everyday
lives, and (3) forge new paths in encouraging researchers and residents to work together as equal partners to
further environmental health knowledge and solve local problems through environmental health science.
Within CHHE, the CEC will link the Facility Cores, Research Interest Groups, and Center leadership. CEC-
sponsored activities will include colloquia and an annual summit that helps Center researchers better
appreciate the social and cultural impact of their work for communities that benefit from it. Going beyond a
purely translation-based approach that featured highly in the first funding cycle, we intend to broaden and
sharpen the scope of who takes part in our engagement efforts, what environmental health communication
and education looks like, how engagement unfolds appropriately and effectively, and why we embrace an
inclusive engagement approach, which will translate into engaged scholarship to share our insights with
researchers and practitioners."
10928216,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Nearly 30 million individuals in the US will suffer from an eating disorder in their lifetime, with onset most
commonly in adolescence and with $65 billion in yearly economic costs. The most prevalent of all eating
disorder phenotypes is binge-eating disorder, which affects 3-5% of the US population and portends an array
of medical and psychiatric sequelae, including cardiometabolic disease and elevated suicidality. Social media
use is ubiquitous among adolescents and implicated in binge-eating disorder, but the directionality and
mechanisms remain unclear. Possible pathways include depression, anxiety, cyberbullying, stress, and poor
sleep. Prior studies have been mostly cross-sectional, and patterns and associations may differ for diverse
subpopulations (e.g., race/ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation). The prevention of binge-eating disorder
requires accurate prediction. Mobile phone use patterns could predict binge-eating disorder; binge-scrolling
social media could predict binge eating. Current guidance for adolescent social media use is limited and non-
specific. Our long-term goal is to inform precision guidance for social media use for adolescents, parents, and
clinicians to mitigate adverse mental health risks and optimize wellbeing. Our objective is to identify
prospective associations, sensitive periods, and mechanisms between social media and binge-eating disorder
from early to late adolescence. Our central hypothesis is that problematic social media behavior patterns (e.g.,
addiction, conflict, overuse, tolerance, and relapse) can predict binge-eating disorder through depression,
anxiety, cyberbullying, stress, and poor sleep. To achieve our objective, we will leverage comprehensive
assessments of social media use (problematic social media use and a novel objective mobile phone tracking
app) and binge-eating behaviors and disorder among a diverse national prospective cohort in the Adolescent
Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (N=11,875), followed annually (6 years completed). The cohort
uniquely starts prior to adolescence to capture onset of social media and binge-eating patterns through early,
mid, and late-adolescence. We will use robust longitudinal and machine learning methods to analyze all
available years of data in the ABCD Study. Our specific aims will: 1) determine longitudinal associations,
bidirectional relationships, and sensitive windows linking problematic social media use patterns and binge-
eating disorder, applying an intersectional framework to characterize heterogeneity by race/ethnicity, gender,
and sexual orientation; 2) identify mechanisms linking problematic social media use with binge-eating disorder;
3) use machine learning algorithms applied to mobile phone data to determine the extent to which social media
use patterns over time can predict binge-eating disorder; and 4) translate findings to inform guidance for
adolescents, parents, and clinicians. We will partner with a Youth Advisory Board and engage adolescents,
parents, and clinicians to develop a robust dissemination plan to inform precision guidance for social media
use among diverse adolescent populations to mitigate potential risks from binge-eating behaviors and disorder."
10933572,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Description)
Hyperphosphorylated tau is the major component of neurofibrillary tangles existing in the brains of Alzheimer’s
Disease patients, but whether soluble hyperphosphorylated tau oligomers are already toxic to neurons, and if
so, through what mechanisms, have remained unclear. This is largely due to the lack of experimental system
to tackle these questions directly. This project will test the hypothesis that hyperphosphorylated tau oligomers
promote neurotoxicity before the formation of insoluble tau fibrils, which is amplified by Ab peptides and/or the
ApoE4 allele, but either apomorphine and raloxifene treatment mitigates these deleterious effects. This project
has three specific aims.
Aim 1 will compare the effects of intrahippocampal injection of tau and hyperphosphorylated tau (hyper-ptau) in
wildtype and AD-mutant mice (J20 and ApoE KI). We will also compare the onset of behavioral/histological deficit
and insoluble tau fibrils in these mice after intrahippocampal injection.
Aim 2 will test the effects of hyper-ptau on the viability, mitochondrial functions, and axonal trasnport of cultured
neurons. We will also confirm mitochondrial dysfunctions after brain injection of hyper-ptau in vivo.
Aim 3 will test the protective effects of apomorphine and raloxifene in preventing hyper-ptau-induced toxicity
and cognitive deficits in mice. Both compounds attenuates ptau aggregation in vitro and have a high potential
to be repurposed for clinical treatment of AD."
10815452,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Recent FDA approval of the anti-beta-amyloid (Ab) antibodies Aducanumab and Lecanemab as the first
mechanism-based Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapies has strengthened the central role of the Ab protein in AD
pathogenesis. However, these imperfect medications have only shown modest cognitive benefits, as AD clinical
symptoms often occur decades after amyloid formation and deposition, and the molecular mechanisms leading
to the demise of neurons in AD brains remain poorly understood. Nevertheless, the success of anti-Aβ
therapeutic antibodies and identification of an APP mutation that protects against AD attest to the existence of
amyloid-related molecular mechanisms that restrain Ab toxicity and confer resilience to AD. Meanwhile, cryo-
electron microscopy structural studies have revealed several types of Aβ filaments isolated from AD brains, and
they differ from those assembled in vitro. These observations suggest that in vivo assembly of amyloid filaments
may require additional cellular factors that control progression of amyloid pathology and connect with non-
amyloid AD pathways. Proteomic studies identified three prominent groups of AD pathology-associated proteins
(ADPs). The current project seeks to test the hypothesis that Midkine and Netrin proteins, top-ranked human
ADPs regulate Ab pathology and connect non-amyloid pathways in AD protein networks. The choice of Midkine
and Netrin was informed by unbiased proteomic screening of hundreds of human brains, by validation studies
that establish functional and physical links to amyloid pathology, and by their potential connections to UNC5C
and ApoE/LRP pathways. The project is organized into three specific aims: 1) to determine the
pathophysiological roles and AD protein networks mediated by Midkine and Pleiotrophin; 2) to map Midkine
interactome and its physical interactions with Aβ filaments; 3) to elucidate the synergistic roles of Midkine,
Pleiotrophin, and Netrin-1 in AD pathogenesis. These studies will reveal the impact of select AD pathology-
associated proteins on disease progression, uncover non-amyloid pathways mediated by these ADPs, and
elucidate the biochemical mechanisms by which Midkine and Netrin family ADPs regulate assembly of Ab
filaments to potentially confer resilience to amyloid toxicity. Success of this project will inform the development
of more robust experimental models and more specific and sensitive therapeutic and imaging agents for AD."
10816970,"PROJECT SUMMARY
It is not known how T cells sense and respond to the stress of solid tumors, or how such responses shape
dysfunction in CD8 tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an organelle primed
to sense environmental stress and to respond through initiation of downstream signal cascades. PKR-like ER
kinase (PERK) is one of three ER sensors that enacts the cell response to stress. We were the first group to
show that T cells in tumors experience the PERK-directed stress response. Using unique T cell-specific PERK
KO mice (OT-1-Lckcre-PERKf/f) we discovered that PERK severely restricts the ability of T cells to control tumor
growth. We now reveal groundbreaking preliminary data that illustrate that in response to the acute stress of the
tumor microenvironment PERK prohibits T cell anti-tumor metabolism and restricts protein synthesis in CD8
TILs. Moreover, we show that CD8 TILs experience chronic ER stress associated with the PERK terminal
unfolded protein response (UPR) enzyme ER oxidoreductase 1 (ERO1a) that induces dysregulated protein
homeostasis (proteostasis) and impairs tumor control. This proposal aims to expand our preliminary data and
develop the abovementioned novel discoveries into immunotherapeutic strategies to treat sarcomas with global
implications for solid tumor cancer patients. To accomplish the aims proposed here we have developed a unique
tumor microenvironment stress assay and sought out new approaches to apply to CD8 TIL biology to measure
molecular changes that occur in T cells under tumor stress. In Aim 1 we will use T cells from OT-1-Lckcre-PERKf/f
mice in our tumor stress assay paired with metabolomics to show that PERK is the central regulator of CD8 TIL
metabolism. We will also use T cells from sarcoma patients and CRISPR/Cas9 in vitro gene editing of PERK to
measure how PERK affects metabolism of human T cells under tumor microenvironment stress. The results are
expected to reframe and advance our current understanding of CD8 TIL metabolism. In Aim 2 we will use T cells
from OT-1-Lckcre-PERKf/f mice in our tumor stress assay paired with ribosome sequencing to discover the
identity of actively translating mRNAs that are impacted by the tumor microenvironment. This work will also test
the new concept that alternative routes of translation are sustainable in the stress of tumors. The results are
expected to create a radical new paradigm of remodeling translation to improve immunotherapy. For Aim 3 we
have created unique ERO1a-/- mice to formally define how ERO1a undermines proteostasis in CD8 TILs using
an in vivo sarcoma model and proteomics. Successful completion of the aims will revolutionize the field of cancer
immunotherapy by generating a new paradigm for the cell stress response as the primary factor that dismantles
CD8 TIL anti-tumor efficacy in solid tumors."

10824314,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Exercise benefits the body in many ways. The functions of skeletal muscle, brain, liver, bone, adipose tissue
and heart all gain from various types of physical activity and training. People suffering from disabilities, morbid
obesity, or age-related diseases, are usually physically inactive, which exacerbates their symptoms and leads to
development of other types of diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and some
forms of cancers. Scientific explorations of exercise have become more molecular, focusing on the pathways
and molecules that mediate these benefits. Irisin has been identified as an exercise-induced hormone that
embodies many adaptations to exercise in a variety of tissues/organs, including “browning” of subcutaneous
adipose tissue, bone remodeling, improving cognitive deficits and neuropathology, and promoting myogenesis
of skeletal muscles.
In bone and fat, the effects of irisin are mediated via αv integrins, with αvβ5 identified as the major receptor.
However, my biochemical and biophysical characterization of direct interaction between irisin and αvβ5
suggested extremely weak binding, while the concentrations of irisin that induce detectable amount of
irisin-mediated effects in the body and in the cultured cells are really low, indicating a very high irisin/receptor
binding affinity. This paradox could be explained by the existence of an additional factor that facilitates
irisin/integrin interaction and irisin-mediated integrin activation. My preliminary data suggested that an
exercise-induced circulating protein Hsp90α binds to integrin αvβ5, and functions as a cofactor to mediate the
binding of irisin to integrin and irisin-induced integrin signaling. Irisin is different from many integrin ligands in
that irisin is small, heavily glycosylated, and lacks the well-identified integrin binding motif, indicating a
non-canonical ways of ligand binding to integrins.
Biophysical and biochemical approaches will be used to characterize the complexes formed by irisin (WT and
glycosylation mutants), αvβ5 and Hsp90α. The molecular model will be firstly tested in HEK293T cells
ectopically expressing αv and β5, and muscle and fat cells, using molecular approaches and fluorescence
microscopy. The effects of Hsp90α will be further evaluated in mice. Taken together, these studies will advance
our understanding of irisin-mediated (or hormone-mediated, in general) integrin signaling, which will assist drug
and antibody development to treat patients with obesity, aged-related diseases and neuro- or muscular
degenerative disorders.
The proposed project represents a great balance between biochemistry/biophysics as well as cell biology, in
which I was trained during my Ph.D, and cell metabolism and animal physiology, which are the primary
technologies employed by the Spiegelman lab. The resources provided by Bruce’s networks, DFCI and HMS,
tremendously facilitated my research, and will support me to become an independent scientist."
10825431,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alternative RNA splicing enables generation of different spliced mRNA isoforms that can encode functionally
distinct proteins. Splicing factors (SFs) are RNA-binding proteins that regulate splicing in a dose-dependent
manner and are frequently dysregulated in diseases. Serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins (SRSF1 to 12, and SR-
like members TRA2α, TRA2β) are a family of essential SFs causatively implicated in a wide range of human
pathologies. Elucidating how SR proteins are regulated is crucial to advance our understanding of the
fundamental processes that control gene expression in eukaryotes and to target diseases with SF defects. Here,
we will focus on post-transcriptional regulation as an important modulator of SR protein expression, and a
potentially actionable pathway for tool and therapeutics development. SR protein genes contain ultra-conserved
non-coding exons, called poison-exons (PEs), which control SR protein auto-regulation. Conservation of PE
sequences across species suggests their importance in regulating SFs. However, how PEs regulate gene
expression and maintain broader SF homeostasis, and how they contribute to fundamental cell functions remain
poorly understood. We hypothesize that PEs play a critical role in maintaining a tight regulation of SF levels,
which is necessary for normal cell functions. Aim 1 will define the mechanisms of SR protein regulation and
cross-regulation via PEs using splicing reporter minigenes, a CRISPR/Cas9 library targeting SFs, and long-read
RNA sequencing. By identifying the SR proteins and SFs that are interconnected and co-regulated through PE
splicing, these findings will provide a comprehensive map of the SR protein regulatory network and will uncover
novel principles of post-transcriptional gene regulation. Aim 2 will define the functional role of SR protein PEs in
development and cell differentiation using CRISPR/Cas9 to delete PE sequences in vivo in mouse embryos and
in vitro in human cell differentiation models. These findings will reveal cell types and cellular states that require
PEs to function normally, as well as PE targets in vivo and in vitro. Aim 3 will develop approaches to modulate
PE splicing and SR protein levels. These approaches will be used to infer SR protein binding rules, and to probe
PE function in relevant disease models. The proposed aims leverage our lab’s expertise in developing tools and
models to study splicing dysregulation in diseases. Completion of these aims will identify novel molecular
mechanisms by which PEs regulate SF homeostasis and cellular functions, and provide new tools to manipulate
SR protein levels. The regulatory mechanisms uncovered here are likely to have broad relevance to many SFs,
the majority of which contain PEs. Manipulating SF levels by targeting PEs could lead to therapeutic approaches
for diseases with SF defects, such as neurological disorders, cardiac myopathies, diabetes, lupus, or cancer."

Recently, it was shown by Dr. Ben Boursi, Sheba Medical Center, that some metastatic melanoma patients who
are refractory to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy can be converted to responders by fecal microbiota transfer (FMT)
from a melanoma patient that had a complete response to immunotherapy. Unfortunately, other donor-recipient
combinations were unsuccessful implying that an additional uncontrolled factor may determine the effects of
microbiota modulation of immunotherapy. Concurrently, we have been using congenic C57BL/6 mice harboring
different naturally occurring mitochondrial DNAs (mtDNAs) (mtDNAB6, mtDNA129, and mtDNANZB) to test
melanoma sensitivity and anti-PD-L1 therapy. We discovered that the mtDNANZB mice are highly resistant to
melanoma progression and strongly respond to anti-PD-L1 therapy, while mtDNA129 mice are permissive for
melanoma growth and refractory to immunotherapy, with mtDNAB6 mice being in between. These mice also differ
in their gut microbiota and metabolomic analysis of the mtDNANZB mice revealed impaired fatty acid oxidation of
relevance to the elaboration of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) by the gut microbiota. When we expressed the
mitochondrially-targeted antioxidant enzyme catalase (mCAT) in the mitochondria of the mouse hematopoietic
cells, we diminished the anti-tumor immune response of the mtDNANZB mice and changed the gut microbiota of
both the mtDNAB6 and mtDNANZB mice. These observations led us to the hypothesis that: Both the gut microbiota
and the immune system are modulated by the mitochondrial genome, in part through mitochondrial reactive
oxygen species (mROS) production in immune cells linking the gut microbiota, tumor progression, and
immunotherapy. To test this hypothesis, we propose three specific aims. First, we will evaluate mitochondrial
function and mROS production in our three congenic strains and correlate this with their immune cell repertoire
and function. Then, we will determine if these congenic strains show the same range of responses to other
tumor types. Second, we will determine which subclass of hematopoietic cells are responsible for the anti-tumor
and pro-immunotherapy response by using adoptive cell transfer (ACT) to replace mtDNA129 immune cells with
mtDNANZB cells. We will then express mCAT in the functional immune cells to determine if this negates the anti-
tumor and pro-immunotherapy response and changes their microbiota. Third, we will use FMT to replace the
gut microbiota of the mtDNA129 and mtDNANZB mice with that of the three congenic strains to determine if
mtDNANZB microbiota enhances the mtDNA129 anti-tumor and pro-immunotherapy phenotype and if mtDNA129
microbiota diminish the mtDNANZB phenotype. To confirm that this is mediated by mROS production, we will
express mCAT in the responsible immune cells of the mtDNA129 mice and confirm that this blocks the induction
of any anti-tumor and pro-immunotherapy phenotype induced by FMT from mtDNANZB mice. To expeditiously
extend these findings to human mtDNA lineages and clinical service, Dr. Boursi has agreed to be a collaborator
and Dr. Yardeni has arranged positions at both CMEM and Sheba."

The interface between nanotechnology and medicine is a new frontier for scientific exploration and for
the creation of new and improved diagnostic and therapeutic tools to detect, treat, cure, and prevent
human diseases. We propose to create an integrated predoctoral and postdoctoral training program
in nanotechnology for cancer research (NTCR) that is positioned at this interface. It is based on two parent
R25 and T32 training grants in the same area. This program will establish a unique national resource with
interdisciplinary and synergistic programs in fundamental research in cancer biology, industrial
collaboration, and translational research in cancer medicine. This program fosters predoctoral and
postdoctoral fellows who are trained across disciplines to lay foundations for technologies that enable
an inside-view of cancer cell functions as opposed to the limited black-box input-output techniques currently
used, introduce new modalities for molecular imaging, develop new high-throughput diagnostic tools, and
engineer novel drug/antibody/siRNA viral and non-viral delivery systems to treat human cancers. NTCR
fellows develop novel cancer diagnostics to evaluate each individual patient's prognosis and optimal
treatment, based upon the patients' genetic and epigenetic markers and disease phenotype and
therapeutics that are selected and optimized for each individual patient. NTCR trainees take one of three
core courses depending on their background, as well as a lab course in cancer nanobiotechnology. They
participate in a journal club and a dedicated annual symposium, as well as clinical conferences and tumor
boards. The NTCR program will recruit outstanding trainees every year with MD and/or PhD degrees
and diverse backgrounds in either biochemistry, physics, molecular/cellular/cancer biology, or an
engineering/physics discipline for a steady state number of 2 postdoctoral and 6 predoctoral fellows. The
NTCR program lasts 3 years for postdoctoral trainees and 4-5 years for predoctoral trainees. NTCR
fellows take advantage of research and clinical resources at the NCI-designated Sidney Kimmel
Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Ludwick Center for Cancer Genetics and Therapeutics, The Sol
Goldman Pancreatic Cancer Center, and the In Vivo Cellular and Molecular Imaging Center, as well as
the unique educational resources and experimental facilities of the recently established Johns Hopkins
Institute for NanoBioTechnology (INBT), which previously housed the center for cancer nanotechnology
excellence (CCNE) and currently the physical sciences-oncology center (PSOC)."
10824318,"Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the US; the most prevalent type of heart disease is caused
by atherosclerosis, the thickening of the vessel wall and creation of atherosclerotic plaque. Intravascular
optical coherence tomography (IV-OCT) has enabled the imaging of coronary artery structures with un-
precedented detail, and can be used to evaluate the response to percutaneous coronary intervention
when treating atherosclerotic lesions. However, there remains a significant need to assess plaque vul-
nerability: the determination of which mild lesions are likely to produce cardiac events in the future,
and thus require immediate preventative interventional measures. Among lesion types, thin-cap fi-
broatheromas (TCFA) are of particular concern since they are believed to be at increased risk of rup-
ture; however, studies have found that only a fraction of TCFAs rupture. Although the likelihood of
rupture has been linked to its mechanical stability, its chemical composition, and its microstructure,
there is currently no technology capable of the biomechanical profiling of plaques in individual patients
during intervention [without the need for time-consuming finite element modeling (FEM)] and the
available methods for determining composition either lack specificity or spatial resolution.
To address this significant need unmet by current intravascular imaging technology, we will develop an
all-optical imaging platform that will profoundly broaden the access to accurate biomechanical, chemi-
cal and microstructural profiling of coronary plaques in individual patients. Our novel platform will en-
able a transformational leap in the current capability for comprehensive plaque characterization, in-
cluding the assessment of plaque composition and vulnerability. We will leverage new ultra-fast laser
sources to develop IV-OCT at 2,000 frames per second, enabling a host of powerful post-processing
techniques that will enhance comprehensive characterization of plaques. In Aim 1 we will develop the
enabling hardware to realize high-speed intravascular imaging. In Aim 2 we will develop hardware and
signal processing to enable microstructural profiling at the 10×302 µm3 (depth×lateral) scale, chemical
profiling at the 80×802 µm3 scale, and biomechanical profiling at the 60×602 µm3 scale in an all-optical
technique without the need for FEM. In Aim 3 we will develop a novel validation platform based on a
soft-robotics cardiac simulator of the biomechanical environment of the human beating heart.
Our single imaging platform will facilitate clinical studies to determine the parameters of plaque vulner-
ability, opening the door to the identification of optimal treatment strategies. Initially, it will become an
invaluable research tool in atherosclerosis; later, it will have the potential to guide intervention in indi-
vidual patients. After completion of the technological developments at the end of the proposed funding
cycle, our platform will be ready for testing in human subjects."

We will investigate Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection of neural progenitor cells (NPCs)
in our R01 application. In immunocompetent individuals, HSV-1 infection is the most common
cause of encephalitis (HSE). Although antiviral therapy has improved its prognosis, the majority
of HSV-1 encephalitis survivors suffer from permanent neurological sequelae. The chronic lesions
in HSE patients have been observed in regions associated with memory formation, which include
the hippocampus and associated limbic structures. The severity of sequela in HSE is related to
the severity of damage to these regions.
HSV-1 displays tropism for hippocampus (subgranular zone, SGZ) and the subventricular zone
(SVZ) of the lateral ventricles. Both regions are rich in NPCs, which differentiate into neurons and
glial cells. These regions are thus major niche areas for adult neurogenesis. Despite the pivotal
role played by the NPCs in adult neurogenesis, the effect of HSV-1 on NPCs proliferation,
differentiation and migration is largely unknown. Furthermore, whether NPCs may represent
reservoirs of HSV-1 in the CNS is unknown.
Here, we aim to model the interaction of HSV-1 with NPCs using three-dimensional (3D) cultures
of human CNS cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs); we will also build on a
mouse model of encephalitis to enable experiments not feasible in human cells in vitro.
In Aim 1, we will investigate early-stage effects of HSV-1 infection on proliferation, differentiation,
and migration of NPCs derived from hiPSCs in three-dimensional (3D) culture systems that we
have designed; the model incorporates NPCs and their derivatives. In Aim 2, we will employ a
mouse model of encephalitis to investigate the distribution of HSV-1 in the hippocampus and SVZ,
the effects of HSV-1 infection on NPCs proliferation and analyze NPCs in surviving mice for
periods ranging from 6 months to 1 year. Also, we will determine if there is evidence of HSV-1
latency and reactivation in NPCs. In Aim 3, we will investigate: i) HSV-1 latency in NPCs; ii) the
effect of HSV-1 infection on pathways regulating the differentiation fate of NPCs pathways
regulating; and iii) the consequences of persistent infection on NPCs function. The rodent and the
iPSC data will be synthesized. We hypothesize that i) HSV-1 impairs NPC processes required
for neurogenesis; ii) HSV-1 can establish latency in NPCs.
What is learned from this project will improve our understanding of HSV-1 encephalitis. We
possess the relevant expertise for the proposed work."
10825441,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Critical injury, including traumatic brain injury (TBI), remains one of the most common causes of morbidity and
mortality in children. Despite efforts to develop pharmacotherapy for TBI, clinical trials have proven ineffective.
Improvements in outcome have largely been due to improvements in medical care. One known complication of
severe TBI is nosocomial infection; the incidence may be as high as 50% with mortality as high as 37%. Even in
the absence of mortality, infection can lead to secondary brain injury and poor outcomes. One cause for post-
injury nosocomial infections is a profound anti-inflammatory response known as immunoparalysis. TBI is strongly
associated with immunoparalysis, and more recent data suggest that patients with TBI plus systemic injury
(polytrauma) are even more prone to nosocomial infection than patients with either injury alone. One pathway
by which this may occur is through a neurally-mediated mechanism known as the cholinergic anti-inflammatory
pathway (CAIP), which involves signaling from the brain to splenic leukocytes via the splenic nerve. Attenuation
of the CAIP is a potential method for reversing immunoparalysis, but other therapeutic targets include
mechanism-independent immunomodulation. Unfortunately, there is little preclinical data examining the timeline
for immune suppression following injury or how reversing post-injury immune suppression may affect the injured,
recovering brain. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop immunomodulatory approaches to improve
outcomes through safe restoration of immune function following critical injury in children. Our central
hypothesis is that post-injury immune suppression is an important acute and chronic sequela of critical
injury that can be attenuated without negatively impacting neurological outcomes. Experiments will
involve using a clinically relevant combined injury model in juvenile rats: an experimentally induced TBI
(controlled cortical impact) followed by hemorrhage induced by aspiration of blood from the femoral artery. To
perform mechanism-specific attenuation of post-traumatic immunosuppression, we propose using splenic
denervation to inhibit the CAIP. As splenic denervation is clinically not practical, we will also use
pharmacotherapeutic agents to target the CAIP, including treatment with an α7 nicotinic receptor antagonist
(memantine) or a beta-adrenergic antagonist (propranolol). We will also examine mechanism-independent
pharmacotherapy of post-traumatic immune suppression using several immunostimulants (GM-CSF, rIL-7, INF
ɣ, and anti-PD-1). Finally, as the long-term immunologic effects of severe traumatic injury are poorly understood,
we will quantify the persistence of immunosuppressive effects of severe trauma in both our TBI/H model and in
critically injured children. This career development award will generate further preliminary data and provide me
with the necessary tools to obtain research independence and further funding in the area of pediatric
neurotrauma."
10898871,"Project Summary/Abstract
Endothelium plays a vital role in hemostasis and thrombosis. It is essential to maintain blood fluidity, but it also
expresses and releases numerous “factors” that regulate blood cell activation and coagulation. Among these,
von Willebrand factor (vWF) is an essential plasma hemostatic factor released by the endothelium. Deficiency
of mature vWF is the most common bleeding disorder in humans. On the other hand, elevated plasma levels of
vWF, or abnormal concentrations of its high-molecular weight multimers, is associated with increased risk of
cardiovascular morbidity. As such, understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie regulated release
of vWF have broad implications in hemostasis and thrombosis. One factor that plays a crucial role in normal
vWF exocytosis from endothelial cells is unimpaired biogenesis of its storage granules, the Weibel-Palade
bodies (WPBs), which is a highly complex process that remains poorly characterized. We have previously
shown that deficiency of biogenesis of lysosome-related organelle complex 2 (BLOC-2) results in impaired
vWF exocytosis. Since, BLOC-2, and other related trafficking proteins, are essential for biogenesis of
lysosomal-related organelles, a group of specialized granules that includes platelet dense granules and
melanosomes, it seems plausible that this protein complex is also required for biogenesis of WPB. We
hypothesize that BLOC-2-mediated endosomal trafficking is critical for biogenesis of WPB. We further
postulate that the exocyst complex plays an essential role in WPB trafficking by 1) interacting with BLOC-2 in
its role in endosomal trafficking 2) and regulating soluble NSF adaptor protein receptor (SNARE)-mediated
fusion of WPBs at the plasma membrane. In Aim 1, we will characterize cargo trafficking from the endosomes
to the maturing WPBs and the dependence of this pathway on BLOC-2. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the role of
the exocyst complex in BLOC-2-dependent endosomal trafficking and characterize the core trafficking
machinery involved in this pathway. And, finally, in Aim 3, we will evaluate the regulatory function of the
exocyst complex in SNARE-mediated fusion of WPBs at the plasma membrane.

The reasons for increased incidence and mortality due to prostate cancer in African-American men could be due
to inherent biological differences and/or socio-economic reasons, but most likely, combination of both. Combined
strategies based on biomedical research, social/behavioral research and community engagement are required
to combat this disease in the African-American community. The Center for Cancer Research and Therapeutic
Development (CCRTD) has focused on reducing the burden of prostate cancer disparities through research,
outreach, and education since 2005. In an effort to engage in bidirectional efforts that inform research
development and progression in health disparities, with support of RCMI, the CCRTD expanded community core
functions to include community engagement (Community Engagement Core) in 2019 as part of its center’s
efforts. The goal of the CEC is to foster a culture of community engagement promoting community-university
partnerships that enrich teaching, learning, research, and creative activities, address critical societal issues, and
contributing to the public good. Through our ongoing RCMI award (5U54MD007590-35), the CEC has engaged
a diverse group of regional stakeholders (e.g., community groups, scientists, advocacy groups) in the Atlanta
metropolitan area to tackle issues of health disparities related to prostate cancer. In this renewal, we propose to
strengthen and expand on established ties while engaging the community in the prioritization, conduct, and

In humans, septins are essential for the proper development and function of nearly every major organ system in
the body. At the molecular scale, septins form scaffolds for cell signaling in fundamental processes like
cytokinesis, cell polarization, and membrane remodeling. In many cases, septin functions rely on their ability to
recognize and bind lipid membranes, as this step concentrates septins and promotes self-assembly. However,
what drives septin localization to membranes of different lipid compositions and membrane shapes is poorly
understood. While septins are capable of binding to a range of membrane shapes (from curved to flat), they
preferentially localize to shallow, convexly curved membranes in vitro and in vivo. Septins have two proposed
membrane binding motifs: one that is essential for curvature sensitivity in vitro and in vivo as well as another
potentially responsible for septins' preference for anionic lipids. Interestingly, these motifs are located on
opposite sides of the septin heterooligomer and are likely not the only components of the septin-membrane
interface(s) – raising the questions, how do septins recognize and bind lipid membranes? What membrane
properties control septin assembly? I hypothesize that septin localization is modulated by both membrane
composition and shape, and that distinct membrane-binding motifs are responsible for directing septin
assembly in different contexts.
Aim 1: Determine role of lipid packing in septin localization. Lipid packing is directly related to membrane
curvature and lipid composition. I hypothesize that septin localization is directed via lipid packing defects that
arise from membrane curvature and/or lipid composition, depending on the context. Using a combination of
molecular dynamics simulations, in vitro reconstitution assays, and whole-cell manipulations, I will measure how
septin assembly changes with the degree of lipid packing in both synthetic and cellular membranes.
Aim 2: Identify specific septin residues required for membrane interactions. I hypothesize that septins use
different amino acid residues to bind membranes of different shapes. Using cryogenic electron microscopy, I will
determine structures of septins bound to liposomes and nanodiscs to emulate curved and flat membranes,
respectively. I will map septin-membrane interface(s) and design mutants to experimentally validate key residues
via in vitro membrane binding assays and in vivo complementation.
This work will determine how septins interact with membranes of different shapes and compositions by directly
monitoring these associations using state-of-the-art fluorescence microscopy and cryo-EM approaches. The
ways that septins distinguish different lipid bilayers directly impacts how septins self-assemble into scaffolds that
organize cell signaling for many different processes."
10822162,"EnClear Therapies is developing new technology for more effective drug delivery to the brain and combining our technology with QurAlis who are developing exciting gene therapy approaches for Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). Excitingly, recent research has functionally linked TDP-43 to stathmin-2 (STMN2) in FTD patient tissue. It is known that the loss of normal TDP-43 function as a regulator of RNA metabolism causes incorrect splicing of STMN2. STMN2 is essential for axonal and neuromuscular junction maintenance and repair. When STMN2 expression is lost, age-induced neurodegeneration and associated dementias, like FTD, are promoted. This newly discovered link between STMN2 and neuronal plasticity, along with STMN2’s interaction with TDP-43, suggests that STMN2 targeting represents a novel and exciting approach for developing a potential therapy for FTD. QurAlis analyzed the STMN2 RNA sequence to identify regions for splice regulation and developed splice switching antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that target these sequences. The ASO dose-dependently restores STMN2 mRNA levels. We now aim to deliver the QurAlis ASOs to target affected neurons in FTD. Gene therapies have been plagued with poor tissue distribution and penetration. A number of gene therapies have been “shelved” or failed clinical trials because of the challenge of reaching brain parenchyma in sufficient quantities. The EnClear system is capable of controlling CSF flow precisely by utilizing our sensor array to understand patients’ physiologic responses to adjust drug infusion rate, CSF flow rate, flow direction and to “oscillate” drug concentration over specific tissue targets. This level of CSF flow control is first-in- class and makes the EnClear system unique and potentially capable of personalized drug delivery to patients with CNS diseases. In this Fast Track NIH/SBIR proposal, our aims in Phase 1 are to gain understanding of the flow dynamics of our system using sheep as our animal model. Employing live imaging we will develop the ideal algorithm for precision drug delivery. After imaging, the drug methotrexate used for treating brain cancer, will be administered. At necropsy, CNS drug tissue concentrations will be quantified to confirm our ability for precision drug delivery and to avoid “off-target” drug delivery. This knowledge gained in Phase 1 related to precision drug targeting will be applied to a larger cohort where we will use our insights on precision drug delivery incorporated into our CSF flow algorithm to dose QurAlis’ STMN2 ASO to target the neurodegenerative disease FTD. In Phase 2, we will confirm distribution of STMN2 ASO to relevant areas of the brain. Results will be applied to the development of the STMN2 ASO as a therapy for FTD patients. Results from this grant will go towards FDA approval of EnClear’s delivery technology with data supporting broad applications to benefit drug delivery for small and large molecules, and gene therapies for many CNS diseases including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (ADRD) such as FTD."

Congenital Myasthenic Syndromes (CMS) are a group of genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous,
neuromuscular transmission disorders characterized by muscle weakness (myasthenia) that worsens with
physical exertion. DoK-7 (Downstream of tyrosine kinase 7) is a key regulator of neuromuscular junction
(NMJ) formation. Homozygous loss-of or reduction of-function mutations in the human DOK7 gene underlie
a limb-girdle type of CMS characterized by NMJs that are about half the normal size. DoK-7 CMS is an orphan
disease estimated to affect 3,600 people worldwide. Patients with DoK-7 CMS have a decreased Quality of
Life (QoL) due to exercise intolerance, dependency on intermittent respiratory support, and/or tube feeding
by adulthood (2/3 of the patients). Moreover, about half of the patients will need a wheelchair for ambulation,
and the other half will require walking aids. No cure nor standardized treatment has been yet developed for
DoK-7 CMS. While forms of CMS are managed through the administration of acetylcholine (AChE) inhibitors,
DoK-7 CMS is refractory and can deteriorate if treated with AChE inhibitors. Symptoms ameliorations for
DoK-7 CMS is achieved by recurrent administration of Ephedrine and Albuterol, 2-adrenergic receptor
agonists, which provide suboptimal symptom management for some patients. Moreover, prolonged exposure
to 2-adrenergic receptor can cause tachycardia cardiac ischemia, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and
increased inflammatory response. Amplo Biotechnology is developing AMP-101, the first gene therapy
product (GTP) for DoK-7 CMS. The treatment is based on a recombinant adeno-associated virus vector
carrying the human DOK7 gene. AMP-101 development has so far progressed exceptionally well. Extensive
testing in a DoK-7 CMS mouse model (DoK-7 KI/KI) during Phase I activities (SBIR project 1R44NS124351-
01) has shown that the GTP is able to rescue the extreme DoK-7 KI/KI phenotype, extending survival and
restoring normal motor activity. GLP Toxicology studies in C57BL/6 mice have shown that AMP-101 is safe
and well tolerated, with no macroscopic observations, and no liver toxicity observed in the histopathology
analysis conducted on D29 and D183 samples. Moreover, activities conducted during Phase II project
(4R44NS124351-02) have demonstrated that AMP-101 can be manufactured at 50 L scale with high purity
and high yield. The new product will enable a shift in the current clinical practice from chronic administration
of drugs to alleviate symptoms to a one-off treatment, administered through a single intravenous injection.
The solution will allow physicians to treat the entire affected population, curing adult disease, and stopping
disease progression in children. The goal of this SBIR Phase II B project is to ensure smooth transition to the
clinic supporting the development of assays to detect cellular immune responses against viral antigens and
viral shedding and the manufacturing of a 500L GMP run."

(mAb’s) with Positron Emission Tomography (PET). ImmunoPET has proven to be a groundbreaking innovation yielding
actionable medical information that is not otherwise obtainable in many disease areas. However, ImmunoPET imaging is
only available at select academic centers limited by complexity of production of short-lived Zr-89-radiolabeled antibodies.,
which prevents access of ImmunoPET to the majority of patient population and to clinical trial utilization.
 To address this barrier, Trace-Ability will develop Tracer-ONE – compact and affordable automation of the entire [Zr-

Production staff will need only to install a kit, add the radionuclide, initiate the process and return to collect the product
along with QC report. Such solution will enable any facility with limited staff and budget to start producing ImmunoPET
tracers in a scalable, standardized, safe and GMP-compliant manner.
 Key new capabilities needed for Tracer-ONE have been demonstrated in Phase I including radiolabeling,
immunoreactivity assay and most QC tests. Phase II is designed to deliver a fully-functional system suitable for cGMP

kit and yielding [Zr-89]VRC01 that meets all requirements for clinical use. Specific Aim 2 Develop fully automated [Zr-
89]VRC01 quality control including immunoreactivity. The deliverable of this aim is to design a disposable kit and
corresponding protocol to enable all measurements required prior to clinical use of [Zr-89]VRC01. Specific Aim 3 Optimize
Tracer-ONE for fully automated production of [Zr-89]VRC01 for clinical use. The ultimate deliverable of this aim is
acceptance of the system’s performance by UCSF quality and regulatory groups. Specific Aim 4 Demonstrate efficient
expansion of established Tracer-ONE capabilities to another HIV ImmunoPET tracer. The deliverable of this aim is a fully
automated radiosynthesis and QC process on Tracer-ONE qualified for a second HIV tracer at UCSF and meeting the same
acceptance criteria as [Zr-89]VRC01.
 The outcome of the project is principal enablement of a capability that does not exist today – routine ImmunoPET
tracer production across a diverse range of products leading to broad availability of ImmunoPET imaging to American
patients in AIDS, cancer, arthritis and other disease areas. In additional to diagnostic value, broad availability of
ImmunoPET will increase the effectiveness of clinical trials and availability of new therapies and the percentage of patients
that respond to therapies."

Breast cancer (BC) lethality is primarily caused by metastasis, which accounts for >90% of BC-related
deaths. The epigenetic mechanisms contributing to metastasis remain largely unknown. CARM1 is
overexpressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and high level of CARM1 expression correlates with
poor prognosis. We have previously shown that either CARM1 knockout or treatment with CARM1 inhibitor
(CARM1i) significantly decreased the growth and invasion of TNBC in vivo. We recently identified MAP2K4,
a stress-activated protein kinase family member, as a substrate of CARM1 in both BC cell lines and primary
TNBC tumors. Our results showed that either mutation of the MAP2K4 single methylation site or inhibition of
CARM1 affects MAP2K4 activation. MAP2K4 is known to elicit the oncogenic functions in TNBC. We
postulate that MAP2K4 methylation by CARM1 potentiates the oncogenic function of MAP2K4. Moreover,
loss-of-function MAP2K4 mutations have been linked to the therapeutic response to clinically investigated
drugs such as PI3K inhibitors (PI3Ki). We found that CARM1i and PI3Ki synergistically inhibits proliferation
and migration of TNBC cells, supporting a TNBC cell autonomous crosstalk between activated MAP2K4
and PI3K to promote tumor growth. Although CARM1i enhances the activity and tumoral infiltration of CD8+
T cells in a 4T1 syngenetic mouse model, CARM1i does not appear to synergize with the anti-PD-1
antibody. We hypothesize that combinatory CARM1 and PI3K inhibition potentiates antitumor immunity and
sensitizes TNBC tumors to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We propose three specific aims: (1)
Determine if MAP2K4 methylation augments the kinase activity of MAP2K4 and enhances JNK activation
and cell migration; (2) Delineate the cell autonomous transcriptional network and signaling pathways
affected by dual inhibition of CARM1 and PI3K; (3) Develop combined targeted and immunotherapy
regimen for treating metastasis in syngeneic mouse models. The objectives of this study are to better
understand how MAP2K4 methylation by CARM1 serves as an epigenetic event that contributes to breast
cancer metastasis and therapeutically target CARM1 and PI3K to sensitize tumors to ICIs for treating
metastatic BC."
10783903,"Project Summary/Abstract
Pulpitis is a painful disease of the dental pulp tissue, which is treated by expensive and invasive dental
procedures such as root canal treatments and tooth extractions. A limited understanding of the intermingling
mechanisms of inflammation and pain involving the innate immune response and the dense innervation of the
pulp tissue jointly, precludes the precise application of conservative treatments and the development of novel
pain management strategies. In this project, the principal investigator will focus on the roles of neutrophils in
nerve injury and pain during pulpitis, and how nociceptive neurons modulate innate immune response. Moreover,
she proposes to study neuro-immune interactions during pulpitis not only limited within the pulp tissue but in the
pulp-periodontium complex where these two neighboring tissues are neuroanatomically connected. The central
hypothesis of the study is that during pulpitis, inflammation is present in the pulp and also in the periodontium,
and it is modulated by nociceptive neurons, and driven by neutrophils which regulate sensory and pain outcomes.
In Aim 1 of the K99 phase, Dr. Erdogan will identify neutrophil-driven nerve injury and pain outcomes during
pulpitis by using different clinically informed animal models of pulpitis, perform pharmacological manipulations
of neutrophils, use tissue-clearing and whole-mount imaging, single-nuclei RNA sequencing and in-situ
hybridization to detect anatomical and transcriptional changes of neurons. She will also use evoked and non-
evoked pain behavior assays. In Aim 2 of the K99 phase, Dr. Erdogan will identify the impact of silencing
nociceptive neurons on neutrophil recruitment and responses in the pulp tissue during pulpitis. She will use
chemogenetic and DREADD-based approaches to silence certain subsets of neurons and perform flow
cytometry and sensitive ELISA-based assays to assess innate immune responses. In the R00 phase of the
award, in Aim 3, Dr. Erdogan will identify the mechanisms and unique signatures of inflammation in the
neighboring periodontium during pulpitis, focusing on neuronal-driven inflammation, by using in-vivo dental pulp
neuron activation models and pulpitis models. She will investigate neurogenic inflammatory mechanisms, and
outcomes and establish the framework and understanding of how the neighboring periodontium anticipates and
responds to diseases affecting the pulp tissue. During the K99 mentored phase, Dr. Erdogan will learn the skills
and cutting-edge techniques necessary to accomplish the proposed research under the guidance of expert
scientists Dr. Isaac M. Chiu (primary mentor), Dr. Jennifer L. Gibbs (co-mentor), Dr. William Renthal and Dr.
Thomas Van Dyke (collaborators) who collectively have an extensive track record of training scientists and
dentist-scientists. The proposed scientific and career development training during the K99 phase of the award
will support Dr. Erdogan in her transition to being an independent dentist-scientist."
10783904,"ABSTRACT
The exon junction complex (EJC) is deposited by the spliceosome upstream of exon–exon junctions during the
process of pre-mRNA splicing. If an exon–exon is sufficiently downstream of either a normal termination codon
or a premature termination codon (the latter of which can be generated by splicing errors or frameshift or
nonsense mutations), then EJC-dependent nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is triggered. NMD destroys
aberrant mRNAs and regulates the normal gene expression of ~5-10% of unmutated mRNAs. I recently
discovered that AKT, a central cell signaling kinase, is a constituent of an alternative EJC containing CASC3
(the AKT EJC) but not UPF2 or RNPS1 (in the canonical UPF2 EJC). AKT functionally replaces UPF2 in UPF2-
independent NMD by activating the key NMD factor UPF1. AKT does so by phosphorylating UPF1; UPF2 does
so by binding UPF1. I found that insulin-mediated activation of AKT signaling increases AKT EJCs at the expense
of UPF2 EJCs, which is the first example of cell-signaling mediated regulation of EJC composition. These
findings are important because AKT signaling and NMD, which converge at the EJC, are both dysregulated in
some cancers, Fragile X syndrome, and type 1 and 2 diabetes. Despite its importance, there are many remaining
uncertainties about how EJCs are formed, including: when and how the commitment to either the AKT EJC or
UPF2 EJC is made; the mechanism by which insulin increases AKT EJC formation; if insulin increases and/or
alters EJC binding at exon−exon junctions; if spliceosomes are involved in alternative EJC formation; the
choreography of steps involved in core EJC formation, presumably on the spliceosome; and how EJCs are
transferred to upstream of exon−exon junctions on newly spliced mRNA, to name a few. In this proposal, I will
start addressing some of these uncertainties while receiving training in concepts and techniques from my
mentoring team so as to continue pursuing these questions in my own lab. In Aim 1 (K99), I will test (i) the
precursor-product relationship between UPF2 EJCs and AKT EJCs (while learning how to generate and use
HEK293T cells engineered for auxin-induced degradation of EJC proteins), (ii) if the insulin-promoted increase
in AKT EJCs and decrease in UPF2 EJCs requires splicing, and (iii) if insulin signaling increases and/or alters
the number of EJC-bound exon–exon junctions (while learning RIP-Seq). In Aim 2 (K99), I will identify and define
any insulin-promoted post-translational modifications (PTMs) on EJC proteins that promote the increase in AKT
EJCs and decrease in UPF2 EJCs (while learning mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics and PTM
profiling). In Aim 3 (R00), I will apply my background in mechanistic biochemistry and training in new techniques
to build an independent research program aimed at elucidating yet-undetermined molecular mechanisms in EJC
biology, starting by defining which splicing factors are needed for core EJC assembly, which splicing factors, if
any, are involved in alternative EJC formation, and for the latter, whether PTMs of splicing factors are involved."

NEUROSCIENCE OF ADDICTION (2024-2027)
Abstract
Drug addiction is among the most prevalent and costly neuropsychiatric disorders faced by our nation. Acute
and repeated exposure to drugs produces neuroadaptation and long-term memories of the experience, but the
circuitry, cellular and molecular adaptations underlying it are only partially understood. There is a need for
increased research in this area that bridges basic and clinical perspectives. The primary objective of the
proposed lecture-and-discussion course is to provide an intensive discussion of the fundamentals, state-of-the-
art advances and major gaps in the neurobiology of drug addiction. Targeted to both new and experienced
investigators, the course will combine formal presentations and informal discussions to convey the merits and
excitement of behavioral, circuitry, cellular and molecular approaches to drug addiction research both at the
preclinical and clinical levels. A range of disciplines and topics will be represented, including noninvasive brain
imaging to identify drug targets and adaptive processes; neuroadaptive processes at the molecular and cellular
level, neural circuits/networks and their modulation, the relevance of genotype and genotype/environmental
interactions to susceptibility and drug response; tolerance and adaptation at the cellular level and approaches
to exploiting the daunting volume generated by neuroinformatics. The course will provide an integrated view of
current and novel research on neuroadaptive responses to addictive drugs. The course will foster discussion
on career development, ethical considerations, collaboration, and integration, as well as provide critical
information needed to construct models of addiction as a disease and identify novel targets for treatments.
Beyond the plane of scientific endeavor, the information is vital for formulating public policy and for
enlightening the public on the neurobiological consequences of drug use and addiction. The course is
designed to generate awareness and interest in multiple levels of analysis, open conduits for collaborations
and present novel routes to investigating the neurobiology of addictive drugs. The course makes every effort to
include a diverse group of participants, being particularly mindful of the inclusion of women, US minorities and
a good balance of national and international scientists. The course has an excellent track record of training and
retaining young scientists in neurobiological and specifically in addiction research. Finally, CSHL has
developed mechanisms for dissemination of the scientific presentations to a broader audience through the use
of open access video archives of the lectures available on Youtube and similar sites."
10792479,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The craniofacial skeletal tissues are composed of multiple functional units, encompassing both mineralized and
non-mineralized components. The non-mineralized tissues, such as sutures, cranial base synchondroses and
periodontal ligaments, exist between mineralized tissues, and play important roles in craniofacial growth and
regeneration by providing a niche for tissue-specific stem cells in postnatal life. Current cell-based therapies
cannot effectively reconstitute stem cell niches; as a result, recovery of devastating skeletal conditions such as
craniofacial deformities and advanced alveolar bone loss associated with periodontal diseases has not been
made possible to date. Functional regeneration of craniofacial skeletal tissues requires an innovative approach
to reestablish inherent stem cells and their supporting niches. In this proposal, we aim to define molecular and
cellular mechanisms underlying developmental plasticity of the craniofacial skeletal lineage and explore the
possibility to apply these mechanisms to enhance endogenous regeneration capacity. We hypothesize that
functionally dedicated cells of the postnatal craniofacial skeletal cell lineage can reconstitute tissue-specific
stem cells and their supporting niches through lineage plasticity. We will test this hypothesis using a
combination of in vivo clonal lineage-tracing and single-cell and spatial transcriptomic approaches to unravel
fundamental molecular and cellular events associated with formation of stem cells and their stem cell niche.
We will focus on two models of the cranial base synchondrosis and the periodontium to investigate
developmental craniofacial skeletal lineage plasticity. In Aim 1, we will characterize plasticity of Runx2+
perichondrial cells in establishing the cranial base synchondrosis niche. We hypothesize Runx2+ perichondrial
fibroblasts generate both stem cells and their niches within postnatal synchondroses through developmental
plasticity. We will use a combination of cell-lineage tracing experiments and single-cell transcriptomic analyses,
high-resolution spatial transcriptomic analysis and CRISPR screens using the feature barcoding technology to
define molecular mechanisms underlying developmental plasticity and stem cell-generating potential of Runx2+
perichondrial cells of the postnatal synchondrosis. In Aim 2, we will explore the possibility to reactivate PTHrP+
cementoblasts to regenerate functional periodontal attachment apparatus. We hypothesize that PTHrP+
cementoblasts on the adult root surface retain a dental follicle (DF) cell-like state, and can be experimentally
reverted to dental root mesenchymal progenitor cells. We will use a combination of cell-lineage tracing
experiments, single-cell and bulk transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses to define how PTHrP+
cementoblasts are related to PTHrP+ DF cells, and change their molecular identities during periodontal
destruction and regeneration. We will also examine whether PTHrP overexpression is sufficient to revert
mature skeletal cells to a mesenchymal progenitor-like state at a post-growth phase, as a proof-of-principle
study to test the applicability of developmental lineage plasticity to adult stages."
10792483,"Neural encoding, the process by which the brain converts sensory stimuli into patterns of electrical activity within neurons, is critical for sensation to guide action. Despite this importance, little is known about how
neural codes are actually used – or “decoded” – by downstream networks in the brain. This gap is due to two
basic challenges: (1) causally perturbing the code with spatiotemporal precision, and (2) measuring the resulting activity from identified postsynaptic target neurons.
 Here, we propose to overcome these challenges, by investigating how an olfactory neural code is decoded by its downstream network in a tractable experimental system: the fruit fly, Drosophila. We have developed new methods to “write” spike patterns into populations of central projection neurons with single cell-type
resolution using 2-photon optogenetics, while recording from their postsynaptic target neurons, which we have
recently identified. This enables direct causal control of precise spiking features of the olfactory neural population code. In Aim 1, we will control combinatorial patterns of spike rates and relative spike latencies in projection neurons with 2-photon optogenetics to determine how these patterns are decoded by downstream neurons. In Aim 2, we will combine 2-photon optogenetic stimulation with olfactory stimulation to examine how
sensory adaptation changes the logic of decoding. In Aim 3, we will test how the downstream neurons are
themselves flexibly decoded into hunger-dependent chemotaxis behavior. Together, these studies will reveal
basic mechanisms by which the brain decodes its own neural code for olfaction.
 Although there are differences between flies and mammals, the basic logic of neural coding is remarkably conserved between invertebrates and vertebrates. These similarities suggest that discoveries made in the
fruit fly will be relevant to the mechanisms of decoding in other animals. A more thorough understanding of the
principles of neural decoding within the brain has the potential to transform the development of novel brain-
machine interfaces that could improve the outcomes of patients with brain injuries."

The etiology of type 2 diabetes (T2D) likely involves a complex interaction of polygenic, metabolic, and
environmental factors including diet. Accumulating experimental, epidemiological, and clinical evidence
supports a pathogenic role of chronic inflammation in T2D development. However, the precise mechanisms
underlying these findings are largely unknown, and current evidence on the causal relationships between
specific inflammatory pathways and T2D risk is inconclusive. Advances in omics technologies have led to
the identification of genes and metabolites associated with T2D risk, but data on mechanisms and causality
are still very limited. Multi-omics integration in the framework of systems epidemiology may provide new
avenues to enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms. To systematically investigate the relation
between chronic inflammation and T2D, I propose to examine 3 Specific Aims by leveraging the rich
resources in the UK Biobank, Nurses’ Health Studies (NHS), Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS),
Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (SOL), and Genotype-Tissue Expression project
(GTEx). In Aim 1 [K99], I will integrate existing genomic data from the UK Biobank, NHS/HPFS, SOL, and
transcriptomic data in the GTEx to examine shared genetic architectures between systemic inflammatory
markers and T2D and whether polygenic susceptibility to chronic inflammation confers T2D risk. Meanwhile,
I will receive extensive training in T2D systems biology and cutting-edge high-dimensional data analytics
and bioinformatics. In Aim 2 [R00], I will integrate dietary and metabolomic data to examine metabolomic
profiles mediating the association between dietary inflammatory potentials and T2D risk in the prospective
NHS/HPFS and the SOL. In Aim 3 [R00], I will conduct plasma proteomic profiling in a nested case-control
study within the NHS to identify inflammatory protein networks in relation to T2D risk, and as a Secondary
Aim, integrate findings from Aim 1-3 to explore T2D-related pathways co-regulating at multiple biological
dimensions. Findings from this project may improve the understanding of inflammatory mechanisms
underlying T2D and identify novel targets/pathways suitable for early detection and prevention. I will be
mentored/advised by an interdisciplinary team that includes Dr. JoAnn Manson (diabetes epidemiologist),
Dr. Liming Liang (expert in statistical omics methodologies), Dr. Frank Hu (nutritional epidemiologist), Dr.
Peter Kraft, (statistical geneticist), Dr. Qibin Qi (genetic epidemiologist), Dr. Towia Libermann (expert in
proteomics), and Dr. Clary Clish (expert in metabolomics). The outstanding training opportunities with key
leaders in these areas will provide me advanced knowledge and skills, positioning me for a successful,
independent career as a diabetes epidemiologist with expertise in systems biology and integrated-omics.
This project aligns with the NIDDK’s goal of integrating multi-omics technologies into diabetes research."
10808410,"Despite vast economic investments to mitigate the harms of opioid use disorder (OUD), the prevalence of the
disorder remains high in addition to an estimated 80,000 Americans dying from opioid-related overdoses yearly.
Given the significant heterogeneity across multiple dimensions of OUD, prioritizing investigations of
multidimensional phenotypes such as resilience may improve our etiological understanding of the disorder. The
goal of the proposed study is to develop a laboratory model of resilience, allowing the objective examination of
this construct in a controlled laboratory setting. The study will employ a within-subjects, randomized design and
investigate associations of resilience with heroin-seeking and decision-making behaviors. In addition, this study
aims to better characterize resilience in individuals with OUD through a deep multidimensional psychological,
cognitive, and affective phenotyping approach. To accomplish these goals, individuals who meet DSM-5 criteria
for OUD will be recruited to achieve N=50 completers. Participants will be stabilized on oral morphine throughout
their 10-day inpatient stay to diminish confounding effects of acute withdrawal symptoms on study assessments.
The primary aim will be to assess whether Resilience Laboratory Tasks (control, cognitive and emotional
flexibility) demonstrate convergent validity with self-reported resilience under stress (Trier Social Stress Test,
TSST) and non-stress (non-stress test; NST) experimental conditions. Participants will undergo these two
experimental sessions (TSST and NST) in random order. During the sessions, heart rate (HR) and HR variability,
blood pressure, and galvanic skin response will be assessed as physiological measures of stress reactivity.
Immediately following the TSST and NST sessions, participants will complete self-report assessments of stress
(perceived stress, craving, and desire to use heroin), a Hypothetical Drug Purchase Task (proxy for heroin self-
administration) and Resilience Laboratory Tasks. This proposal will allow the validation of a novel laboratory
procedure to empirically examine resilience and provide preliminary data for the psychological, cognitive,
emotional, and behavioral substrates of this construct. Additionally, this K08 proposal will provide critical training
needed to achieve my career goal of becoming an independently funded scientist-clinician. Specifically, this
mentored award will advance my research career by (1) providing essential training in study design and
methodology to evaluate the convergent validity of measures of resilience using human stress paradigms, (2)
supporting the development of a valid multidimensional phenotypic assessment battery to characterize
heterogeneity across multiple dimensions of OUD, (3) improving my skills in advanced statistical methods and
allowing me to develop a fundamental understanding of computational modeling, (4) improving my manuscript
and grant record. The training goals outlined in this K08 resubmission will equip me with a unique set of skills in
human laboratory paradigms and computational modeling which, in combination with the pilot data collected as
part of the proposed research, will make me a highly competitive candidate for future R01 submissions."

Despite exciting advances, lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States.
A critical gap in our understanding is how lung cancer cells become metastatic and resistant to our treatments.
Historically, lung cancer research has focused on genetic drivers as the main culprits of disease. But recent,
large DNA and RNA sequencing studies have shown that genetic changes account for only 50% of lung cancer
progression, strongly suggesting there are unidentified non-genetic mechanisms of disease progression.
The PI’s preliminary data has identified that propionate metabolism—a metabolic pathway previously not known
to play a role in cancer—is dysregulated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Indeed, their data show that
methylmalonic acid (MMA), a key metabolic byproduct of propionate metabolism that can promote epithelial-to-
mesenchymal transition (EMT), is elevated in lung cancers and in the serum of patients with metastatic disease.
Moreover, the PI has identified that MMA can activate and bind to G-protein coupled receptors, uncovering a
novel signaling axis. His preliminary data also shows that MMAB, a key regulatory gene of propionate
metabolism, is underexpressed in NSCLC and knocking down MMAB promotes EMT and drug resistance in lung
cancer cells. These studies have led to the central hypothesis that propionate metabolism dysregulation
promotes lung cancer progression and drug resistance in NSCLC and is an important non-genetic mechanism
of disease progression. The goal of the proposed studies are to understand i) the mechanism by which MMA
signals ii) the effect of MMAB loss in NSCLC and iii) the in vivo effects of MMA in NSCLC using mouse models.
Successful completion of the proposed work will improve our understanding of a metabolic pathway in lung
cancer that is poorly understood and potentially identify a new pathway that could be targeted therapeutically.
This proposal describes a five-year training program to launch an independent research career focusing on
mechanisms of NSCLC drug resistance and metastasis. The candidate, Dr. Bobak Parang, is a medical oncology
fellow at Weill Cornell Medicine who has been training to become a physician-scientist for over ten years. He
has outlined a career development plan that will build on his strong background in cancer biology and clinical
oncology by providing rigorous training and new skills in molecular biology, metabolomics, and mouse models
of lung cancer. He will perform the proposed studies under the mentorship of Dr. John Blenis, a world renowned
expert in molecular biology, cancer metabolism, and cellular signaling in the rich institutional environment of
Weill Cornell Medicine. With the mentorship team he has assembled, his strong clinical and scientific
background, and his training plan, Dr. Parang is ideally positioned to develop into an independent laboratory-
based physician scientist with R01 funding."
10810757,"PROJECT ABSTRACT – COMPONENT A (CORE SURVEILLANCE)
The Pregnancy Risk Assessment and Monitoring System (PRAMS) was initiated in 1987 as
part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) initiative to reduce infant
mortality and low birth weight. In recent years, the program has been expanded in support
of CDC’s Safe Motherhood Initiative to promote healthy pregnancies and the delivery of
healthy infants. PRAMS is an ongoing, population-based surveillance system designed to
identify and monitor selected maternal experiences and behaviors that occur before and
during pregnancy and during the child’s early infancy among a stratified sample of women
delivering a live birth.
Missouri PRAMS has been collecting data since 2007 about the health and well-being of
women before, during and shortly after pregnancy and during the child’s early infancy.
These data are not routinely available from other sources and can be used to identify groups
of women and infants at high risk for health problems and adverse pregnancy / birth
outcomes. Missouri PRAMS data is also extremely helpful in monitoring changes in health
status of women and children in the state, identification of emerging health issues and
measuring progress towards goals in improving the health of mothers and infants in
Missouri.
Missouri PRAMS uses a standardized data collection methodology developed in accordance
with the CDC PRAMS Model Surveillance protocol required for all PRAMS grantees. This
standardized approach allows for comparisons among states and for optimal use of the data
for single-state or multistate analysis. Each month, a stratified random sample of women
delivering a recent live birth is drawn from the state’s birth certificate file and data is
collected from this sample of women through mail and telephone modes. The data is
weighted so that findings can be applied to the state’s entire population of women with a
recent delivery.
Missouri PRAMS continues to be a key resource for program planning, improvement,
evaluation and policy development. During this project cycle, Missouri PRAMS will
continue to collect high quality data and will further enhance its efforts towards data
analysis, linkages, dissemination and translation with a life-course perspective approach."

 Arkansas PRAMS
 Component A
 The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) survey is an on-going,
population-based surveillance system that collects state-specific information about mothers'
behaviors and experiences that occur before, during, and after pregnancy that might affect their
health or the health of their baby. The survey was developed to reduce infant mortality and to
promote infant and maternal health. PRAMS provides state-specific information that is not
available from the birth certificate or other sources.
 The long-term goal or aim of the Arkansas Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring
System (PRAMS) survey is to reduce infant mortality and morbidity by collecting and
disseminating data that can be used to promote infant and maternal health by influencing
maternal and child health programs, policies, and maternal behaviors during pregnancy and
early infancy.
 The specific objectives of the Arkansas PRAMS program in meeting these goals will
be to do the following:
1) Collect population-based data of high scientific quality on topics related to pregnancy
and early infancy;
 2) Promote the use and increase the visibility of PRAMS data to educate healthcare
personnel about maternal and child health problems and factors related to these problems, to
encourage translation of the data into programs or strategies to improve maternal and child
health, and to inform or implement policies to improve infant and maternal health;
 3) Analyze and disseminate PRAMS data to inform the healthcare community about
behaviors and experiences that affect infant and maternal health; and
 4) Provide technical assistance to organizations or persons interested in using PRAMS
data.
 PRAMS is a mail/telephone survey. Each month, the Arkansas Department of Health
randomly identifies a sample of about 150 recent mothers from the Arkansas birth certificate
files. Mothers who do not respond to either of three mail surveys are contacted for a telephone
interview.
 Reducing infant mortality is a top priority for the Arkansas Department of Health (ADH).
Data from the PRAMS survey can be used to meet or address the objectives set for the
maternal and child health priorities and reproductive health priorities developed by the ADH
Family Health Branch."
10810764,"In order to build complex and structured tissues, organs and embryos during development, individual
cells need to interpret their environment and acquire appropriate cell fates at the right place and time. Failure to
do so can result in various developmental abnormalities or the emergence of cancer when cells become
unresponsive to the stops and checks imposed by their environment.
 The preimplantation mouse embryo develops without any spatially pre-patterned information from the
oocyte and without any external input, making it an ideal mammalian developmental system to address how cells
interact with their surroundings to specify and maintain cell fates. The first cell fate decision is made in the context
of a mere ball of cells. Cells allocated to the surface will acquire the trophectoderm fate, becoming the progenitors
of the future placenta, and cells within the embryo will become the inner cell mass, giving rise to the embryo
proper and extraembryonic membranes. Interpreting this positional information through the presence or absence
of apico-basal polarity, which in turn dictates the activity of the conserved Hippo signaling pathway and the
subcellular localization of its effector, Yes-associated protein (YAP), was shown to play a role in driving fate
specific gene expression programs. However, YAP has been shown to be a key transducer of various mechanical
inputs in other systems, including sensing cell shape, extracellular matrix stiffness or tensile forces transmitted
by neighboring cells. Although mechanosensing has been proposed to occur during preimplantation
development, it is unclear which mechanical inputs are interpreted and whether these directly influence YAP
localization and thereby cell fate. Additionally, as most of our understanding of YAP regulation stems from the
analysis of fixed samples, how mechanical and polarity cues regulate YAP localization dynamics is not known.
Here we will use cutting-edge long term live imaging of endogenously tagged reporters of YAP and downstream
lineage markers to simultaneously measure cell shape and position, YAP localization and cell fate specific
transcription factor expression to reveal their joint dynamics. To probe the role of mechanical inputs and cell
geometry in directing YAP localization, we use various mechanical perturbations coupled with live or single cell
transcriptomic readouts. These perturbations include substituting cell-cell interactions normally experienced in
the embryo with cell-mimetic biomaterials, which can be fine-tuned to precisely manipulate geometric and
mechanical inputs a single cell receives; or applying different amounts of strain to cells to probe the effects
experienced when the blastocoel cavity forms. Finally, by using Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching
and protein stability measurements in live embryos, we will determine how polarity and mechanics regulate the
kinetic behavior of YAP and how YAP activity dynamics is linked to cell fate acquisition and maintenance. This
work will shed light on how a conserved signaling pathway operates to integrate multiple inputs coupling
morphogenesis with robust acquisition of cell fate in the early mammalian embryo."
10812055,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Normal aging is associated with a gradual decline in cognitive abilities across the lifespan, which is accelerated
by midlife vascular risk factors, including stiffening of the large elastic arteries. The purpose of this project is to
determine whether arterial stiffness is an early contributor to cognitive aging through the transmission of
damaging pulsatile energy into the brain. Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) is a non-invasive imaging
modality that detects the viscoelastic properties of tissue and serves as a sensitive biomarker of brain tissue
health and microstructural integrity. MRE has shown that brain tissue softening occurs with normal aging and
likely precedes gross tissue atrophy. This 3-year longitudinal study seeks to determine the underlying
mechanisms linking midlife vascular risk factors with the early loss of brain tissue structure and function. We will
(1) determine the early mechanisms leading to age-related increases in cerebrovascular pulsatility, (2) determine
whether changes in cerebrovascular pulsatility and brain tissue viscoelasticity are spatially and temporally
correlated, and (3) determine whether cerebrovascular pulsatility mediates the loss of cognitive performance
through the disruption of specific neuronal substrates important for memory performance (i.e., the hippocampus).
Ultimately, this project will identify the earliest underlying mechanisms by which vascular aging contributes to
the loss of brain tissue integrity and cognitive performance leading to new targets for interventions aimed at
preventing age-related cognitive impairment."
10924021,"Project Summary
Adolescent suicide rates have increased over the past two decades, with the recent COVID-19 exacerbating
pre-pandemic risk factors including increases in online social messaging. We propose that online social
messaging for adolescents serves as a “social zeitgeber” (an environmental “time giver” that synchronizes
diurnal rhythm) and that late night online social messaging contributes to delays in sleep onset. Over time,
delays in sleep onset in combination with inability to phase shift the wake time for adolescents, contributes to
impairments in cognitive and emotional capacity for managing daily stress, resulting in overall vulnerability
throughout the day as well as a shift of vulnerability to the evenings when research has shown increases in
adolescent suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The present research longitudinal research will examine these
processes in the real world using a combination of (1) text extraction of online social messaging during the
intensive sampling period, (2) ecological momentary assessment (EMA), and (3) wearable technology in
combination with predictive algorithms. Findings will inform interventions that can range from ecological
momentary interventions to adaptations to interventions such as Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy."

The Program will publicize the availability of pilot project funds, solicit and coordinate the review of pilot project applications, make funding recommendations, monitor the progress of research projects, assess usage of center cores by pilot projects, and track deliverables. A mix of investigators will be targeted, including new early stage investigators, community partners, and established researchers who can apply their expertise in novel ways relevant to environmental health. Results obtained through pilot projects will be disseminated via the annual Research!Louisville event that showcases research to the university, local, and regional communities. Because the ultimate goal is to develop new, self-sustaining research projects, an emphasis will be placed on facilitating and improving the quality of new grant applications pertaining to environmental exposures/lifestyle factors. Strategies for this include obtaining feedback from CIEHS members regarding pilot project findings and experimental design as well as performing rigorous internal review of grant proposals. Thus, the Program will assist investigators throughout the pilot project life cycle from initial idea to extramurally funded project and is expected to generate significant new research funding and enhance the capacity for research in the environmental health sciences at the University of Louisville."

There is a worldwide need for improved treatment of systemic, life-threatening fungal infections.
Current therapies are limited by the small number of approved drugs, toxicities, drug-drug
interactions, mode of administration, and growing problems of drug resistance and emerging
pathogens. Treatment also suffers from a lack of rapid clinical diagnoses, leading to dependence
on broad-spectrum antifungal drugs. Moreover, existing antifungal drug classes target membrane
and cell wall integrity, and there is a need to develop drugs against targets with new modes of
action to minimize cross resistance. Available evidence suggests dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)
might be one such target. Commercial DHFR inhibitors are available for other therapeutic
indications (immunology, oncology, antibacterial, antiparasitic). Bactrim® is the only available
DHFR inhibitor for fungal infections but has a very narrow spectrum of activity (Pneumocystis
jirovecii and Paracoccidioides spp.), despite DHFR being an essential enzyme that is highly
conserved in fungal pathogens. As demonstrated in the current work, Candida spp., Aspergillus
spp., Cryptococcus spp., rare molds, Mucorales and dermatophytes are susceptible to DHFR
inhibition, and the DHFR mechanism of action is complementary to the targets of existing
antifungals. Fungal DHFR inhibitors have been identified that inhibit the enzyme selectively and
fungal cell growth in vitro, and fungal DHFRs differ in structure sufficiently from human DHFR
indicating that development of selective DHFR drugs is feasible. The specific aims of this Fast
Track proposal are to (1) reduce serum antagonism of our initial fungal DHFR inhibitors and
demonstrate in vivo efficacy, (2) optimize a lead fungal DHFR compound or series to select a
potential development candidate and (3) validate a fungal DHFR lead (or leads) and select a
single candidate for IND-enabling studies. The approach will enable a robust lead optimization
program to accomplish the aims and will include analog synthesis and computational chemistry,
biochemical, structural, and modeling studies, whole-cell assays, in vivo models (i.e., efficacy,
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic) and in vitro ADME/Safety profiling to synthesize and test
inhibitors against fungal and human DHFR enzymes, fungal pathogens, and mammalian cells.
The outcomes will advance this program into IND-enabling studies (Phase IIB). The long-term
objective is to develop fungal-selective DHFR inhibitors into a new class of broad-spectrum
antifungal drugs."

 Dr. Halima Amjad is an Assistant Professor of Medicine and practicing geriatrician with clinical
expertise in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.
Her long-term career goal is to become a leader in patient-oriented research that informs and improves
medical care for older adults with dementia through the development and implementation of care delivery
interventions in clinical practice. This award will ensure she has the knowledge, skills, and experience to
develop effective interventions, lead clinical trials, and translate research findings into routine clinical care. The
career development plan proposes five years of informal and formal training in mixed methods research,
intervention development and testing including clinical trials, and implementation science focused on
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Dr. Amjad has convened an outstanding mentorship team with
expertise in the relevant research methods, dementia care, primary care, and care for complex older adults.
The proposal will take place in a rich scientific environment with the resources necessary to support her
research, career development, and transition to independent clinical investigation.
 Despite the growing burden of dementia on patients, families, and health systems, the majority of older
adults with dementia receive suboptimal care for dementia after diagnosis. Clinical practice guidelines for
dementia care are available, but are not widely known or consistently followed. Recent health systems
changes, including new Medicare reimbursement mechanisms and uptake of electronic medical records
(EMRs), present opportunities to improve post-diagnosis care for dementia in busy primary care settings. The
proposal leverages these opportunities to address the complex challenges of clinical practice transformation
and linking diagnosis to timely, high quality dementia care. Aims 1 and 2 use a mixed methods approach
(primary care provider and multidisciplinary staff surveys and interviews, patient and family interviews) to
understand barriers and facilitators to post-diagnosis dementia care, key stakeholder perspectives on essential
components and strategies for dementia care, and perceived feasibility of a comprehensive, multidisciplinary
post-diagnosis dementia care intervention. Results will inform the adaptation of an intervention centered
around a structured post-diagnosis dementia care visit in primary care in Aim 3. Implementation will leverage
EMRs and Medicare reimbursement for dementia care to bring dementia-related assessment and support tools
to primary care. Feasibility and acceptability of the intervention will be tested in one primary care clinic, laying
the groundwork for a future multisite pragmatic randomized controlled trial to assess intervention effectiveness
in improving quality of care and patient outcomes. The proposal addresses a significant challenge (dementia
care) in an important setting (primary care). It will lead to an intervention that can be widely implemented and a
clinical investigator poised to transform medical care for persons living with dementia."

Metazoan cell migration contributes to developmental and homeostatic processes, including formation of tissues and
organs, wound healing, tissue renewal and immune responses. Alterations in cell migration lead to developmental defects,
inflammation, persistent wounds and metastasis. Deciphering mechanisms of cell migration thus has broad significance
for understanding both physiological and pathological processes. Considerable effort has led to deep understanding of
some of the critical processes that contribute to cell migration, including protrusion of the leading edge and formation of
adhesions. Other important aspects of cell migration have received scant attention and there is a gap in our understanding
of their mechanism and contribution to cell migration. This proposal seeks to fill this knowledge gap for two such
processes: nuclear positioning and integrin recycling. Both these processes are essential for cell migration, but mechanistic
understanding of how they do so is lacking. This proposal will build on results previously obtained in two previous projects
in the Gundersen laboratory supported by NIGMS. For nuclear positioning, we will examine how the linker of
nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex is mechanically reinforced to resist the large forces necessary to move
the nucleus and will use and develop new tension sensors to directly measure forces on the nucleus. We will determine
how the LINC complex selects actin filament or microtubules for nuclear movement and the functional consequences of
these interactions for different modes of cell migration. We will test new hypotheses that the nucleus functions as a
“tension resistor” for actin filaments and as a polarity factor for microtubule trafficking. For integrin recycling, we will test
the overall hypothesis that recycled integrins travel in an active conformation and that this seeds new adhesion formation
in a polarized manner near the leading edge. We will use new integrin probes and a new integrin recycling system to
identify sites of integrin exocytosis and their relationship to newly formed adhesions. In migrating cells, we will determine
whether recycled integrin derives from the cell rear and contributes to nascent adhesion formation near the leading edge.
We will identify the microtubule machinery that we hypothesize is responsible for the polarized reformation of adhesions
from recycled integrins and test the possibility that the recycled integrin plays a role in integrin signaling. Our proposed
studies on these two processes will advance understanding of the basic mechanisms of cell migration and potential
identify new targets for intervening in cases when cell migration goes awry. The proposed studies will also provide fertile
ground for postdoctoral fellows and graduate students to advance their training and develop their own projects."
10824326,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal motor neuron (MN) disease that is associated with features of
neuroinflammation. Although mounting evidence supports the notion that neuroinflammation may play an active
role in ALS pathogenesis, anti-inflammatory therapies have to provide either no or minimal disease-modifying
effect in ALS. Herein, we hypothesize that since immune cells exhibit a phenotypic heterogeneity, effective
immune response-modifying therapy for ALS requires the targeting of specific components of neuroinflammation
rather than broadly inhibiting its signaling. The rationale for this research is that, once the genomic signatures
of immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS) of ALS are
known, meaningful biomarkers can be identified and innovative therapeutic strategies can be devised. Thus,
the following three aims are proposed. To define the heterogeneity of the immune cell response within the CNS,
in AIM 1, we will perform single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNASeq) using freshly extracted immune cells from
spinal cord (ALS susceptible region) and hippocampus (ALS resistant region) of patients with ALS as well as of
the extensively used and validated transgenic (Tg) mutant SOD1 (mutSOD1) mouse model of ALS, from pre-
symptomatic to end-stage paralysis. We will then utilize this large-scale multivariable dataset computationally
to construct an integrated CNS immune cell response signature associated with MN degeneration. Since motor
axon degeneration is a critical feature of ALS pathology and takes place outside of the CNS, in AIM 2, we will
perform a phenotypical analysis of peripheral nerve infiltrating adaptive and innate immune cells by scRNASeq
in sciatic nerves from both ALS patients and Tg mutSOD1 mice using the same analytic pipeline as in AIM 1.
We will then computationally construct a bi-compartmental model that integrates the CNS and PNS immune cell
information to generate a neuroinflammatory signature of ALS. Lastly, since subregions of the spinal cord
degenerate unevenly in ALS, we will use the integrated, neuroinflammatory signatures generates in AIM 1 & 2
to: (i) interrogate an existing, comprehensive spatial transcriptome database from both ALS patients and Tg
mutSOD1 mice, and by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy (ii) localize the different spinal cord
immune cell subpopulations in the respective tissue. Successful completion of the proposed investigations will
establish heterogeneity of the immune cell phenotype in ALS in both the PNS and CNS in response to
neurodegeneration. These findings will have an important positive impact in that they will provide opportunities
for novel pathogenic hypothesis, for identification of biomarkers and for therapeutic interventions in ALS and
related disorders."

At least 7 million people have died from COVID-19 with > half the world likely infected and a staggering burden
of Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) affecting ~20M Americans with long-term, often crippling,
symptoms including neurological symptoms (“brain fog”, memory and/or concentration disruptions), autonomic
dysfunction, fatigue, flu-like symptoms, post-exertional malaise, and cardiovascular issues. PASC may develop
in 50-70% of hospitalized and ~10-12% of non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with considerable personal,
medical and economic burden. Although PASC is now well-described clinically, the immune mechanisms are
poorly-understood and treatments are limited. One hypothesis is that persisting SARS-CoV-2 virus and/or
antigen is involved. Alternative hypotheses that are not mutually exclusive include: (i) autoreactivity; (ii) persisting
immune dysregulation; (iii) reactivation of latent viruses including EBV. Indeed, viral RNA/antigen is more likely
to be found in PASC than healthy recovered individuals. Some groups have also reported EBV reactivation in
PASC suggesting perhaps a connection between persisting SARS-CoV-2 and reactivation of other latent viruses.
Persisting viral infections can cause immunopathogenesis and ongoing innate or adaptive immune stimulation.
However, how SARS-CoV-2 persistence or reactivating latent viruses are involved and the role of persisting
immune stimulation in PASC is unclear. We postulate that chronic stimulation of antigen-specific CD8 T cells,
GC-dependent CD4 T cells and B cells, and/or myeloid cells occurs in PASC and drives pathogenesis, but also
that these perturbations can be harnessed like immune biosensors to dissect disease mechanisms. Examining
immune perturbations of chronic viral infections has been a hallmark of this CCHI U19 Program since its inception
and is a strong foundation to address these questions. We hypothesize that PASC is associated with durable
immune dysregulation linked to viral/antigen persistence, reactivation of latent viruses, and/or chronic
inflammation. We will address these questions through deep interrogation of immune responses. In Aim 1, we
will test whether altered CD8 T cell responses in PASC reflect exposure to persistent antigen, long-lasting
inflammation or altered CD8 T cell activation during acute infection. In Aim 2, we will examine whether altered
or misdirected germinal center (GC) responses in PASC implicate persisting antigen or “distraction” associated
with altered inflammation and/or autoimmunity. In Aim 3, we will identify PASC-associated alterations in the
myeloid cell compartment connected with changes in adaptive immune responses. This work will reveal new
concepts about persisting/chronic infections with implications for therapeutics for PASC and possibly other post-
acute infection sequelae. Project 1 capitalizes on a long history of expertise in our U19 Program on chronic viral
infections and will thus draw on Project 2 and 3. Core B will generate samples used in this Project, and all aims
of Project 1 will use Core C services. Projects 1, 2 and 3 will integrate their finding to understand shared features
and mechanisms of chronic immune abnormalities after infection."
10824340,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nosocomial infections remain the leading cause of death in severely burned patients due to barrier loss, im-
paired immunity, and high prevalence of antibiotic resistant pathogens. Immunomodulatory strategies aimed at
augmenting the host response are greatly needed. Evidence suggests that Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists
hold strong promise as immunotherapeutic agents to achieve that goal. Priming with TLR4 agonists enhances
resistance against a variety of clinically relevant infections associated with severe burn injury in mice via induc-
tion of “trained immunity” whereby innate immune cells become more responsive to subsequent infectious
stimuli. TLR4-mediated trained immunity is characterized by metabolic reprogramming and mitochondrial ex-
pansion in macrophages which boost antimicrobial responses. Cellular signaling mechanisms responsible for
TLR-mediated trained immunity and the effect of burn injury on metabolic and mitochondrial function in innate
leukocytes remains to be elucidated. Our research program aims to investigate immunomodulatory therapies
for prevention of infection following severe burn by elucidating burn-induced immunometabolic dysfunction and
the potential for triggering trained immunity for protection after burn. To achieve these goals, we will pursue
three integrated projects: Project 1 will investigate the impact of severe burn and post-burn infection on
myeloid cell immunometabolism and mitochondrial function. We will assess metabolic, mitochondrial, and
antimicrobial function using a variety of techniques including glycolytic and oxidative stress capacity, mitochon-
drial content and function analyses, and differential gene expression in mouse and human leukocytes after
burn. This project will expand our understanding of molecular mechanisms behind burn-induced leukocyte dys-
function. Project 2 will evaluate mechanisms by which TLR agonists induce trained immunity in leuko-
cytes after burn. We will use genetic modification, TLR signaling pathway-selective agonism, and signaling
pathway blockade to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in TLR-mediated induction of trained im-
munity after burn. We will examine the ability of TLR agonists to induce trained immunity in leukocytes from
burn patients. This project will fill critical gaps in our understanding of mechanisms by which we can improve
resistance to infections in burn patients. Project 3 will elucidate the potential of targeting TLR-signaling
pathways for therapeutic benefit in clinically relevant models of burn-associated infection. We will de-
termine the efficacy of clinically applicable TLR agonists in conferring protection against a variety of pathogens
prevalent in burn patients. We will evaluate protection duration, extension of protection upon repeated therapy,
and whether TLR agonists can promote infection clearance after infection onset. This project will reveal poten-
tial drug targets that should be considered for clinical development for mediating protection against nosocomial
infections in burn patients. These projects will enhance our understanding of burn-induced innate immune dys-
function and identify therapeutic targets to improve immunity and protect against burn-related infections."

Lower respiratory tract infection (pneumonia) causes almost 80% of deaths due to infection. For many otherwise
fatal lung diseases, lung transplantation is the only curative option yet carries a dismal 5-year survival of 50%.
Primary graft dysfunction following lung transplantation is responsible for the bulk of the early mortality following
lung transplantation and is the dominant risk factor for chronic lung allograft dysfunction, the major barrier to long
term survival in lung transplant recipients. We and others determined that a profound neutrophilic alveolitis is
central to both pneumonia and PGD, yet mechanisms underlying the pathobiology of neutrophilic lung injury in
these important diseases remain unclear. At Northwestern, we have created robust research programs engaged
in high-volume, serial bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, lung tissue, and blood sample collection from patients with
pneumonia as part of routine clinical care as well as from donor lungs throughout the course of lung
transplantation. Hence, we are well-positioned to test mechanistic questions about the activation, migration, and
function of lung neutrophils in well-phenotyped patients with neutrophilic alveolitis. Historically, neutrophils have
been viewed as a homogenous, single-function population; however, our preliminary data point to substantial
heterogeneity in lung and blood neutrophils. For example, we identified heterogeneity in expression of the
integrin CD11b, which we found serves as a negative regulator of inflammatory signaling. We also observed in
preliminary data that type I and II interferons (IFNs) have different expression levels in the circulation versus in
the alveolar space and that lung epithelial and endothelial cells are sources of the key neutrophil cytokine CSF3.
Hence, we hypothesize that CD11b/TLR/MYD88/NFκB signaling and systemic and tissue-derived signals
(CSF3 and type I and II IFN) regulate neutrophil activation, migration, and function in patients with severe
pneumonia and PGD. To test our hypothesis in humans, we will perform systematic sampling and
multidimensional assessment using single-cell sequencing and spatial profiling of neutrophils in the circulation
and alveolar compartments of hundreds of patients with severe pneumonia and PGD. We will integrate these
molecular datasets with ex vivo functional assays and deep clinical phenotypes. In Aim 1, we will determine
whether CD11b/TLR/MYD88/NFκB signaling and type I and II IFN control neutrophil activation, migration, and
function in patients with severe pneumonia and PGD. In Aim 2, we will determine whether CSF3 generated
within the alveolus determines neutrophil maturation, activation, migration, and function and whether arginase-
1 and BAFF link persistent neutrophilia to adaptive immunity in patients with pneumonia and PGD. In both Aims,
we will use cutting-edge computational strategies to test whether these pathways are associated with disease
etiology, steroid responsiveness, age, and mortality in patients with severe pneumonia and PGD. We will address
critical knowledge gaps by investigating neutrophil activation, migration, and function in patients with severe
pneumonia and PGD with the goal of therapeutic targets for these devastating diseases."

Premature infants are frequently at risk of infections, jaundice and hypoglycemia – conditions monitored by
analysis of blood for c-reactive protein (CRP), bilirubin and glucose respectively. Typically, 0.5 mL of blood is
drawn each time an infant is tested, with multiple blood draws happening over the course of days. Given that a
total blood volume for premature infants may be as little as 50 mL, up to 20% of blood volume may be lost due
to testing. This puts infants at risk of iatrogenic anemia and packed red blood cell transfusions. While these
transfusions are considered safe in many regards, they do expose neonates to transfusion-acquired infections,
cytomegalovirus in particular. Our team has identified a need for a volume-sparing blood analysis platform that
could be deployed in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). During Phase I of this STTR application, we de-
veloped a valve-enabled microfluidic device capable of isolating plasma and analyzing multiple biomarkers,
including glucose, from ~5 microliters of blood in under 10 min. Our device used ~100 fold less blood and de-
livered results 10 times faster compared to current assays while eliminating the need for benchtop laboratory
equipment (e.g. centrifuge for plasma separation). The microfluidic devices were prototyped in silicone rubber
(PDMS). During Phase II of the project, we will fabricate automated microfluidic devices using materials ame-
nable to scalable and inexpensive manufacturing. Our devices will be capable of detecting CRP, bilirubin and
glucose and will be suitable for operation at the point of care, in the NICU.
Broader impacts: The microfluidic device and control system to be developed in this project represent a plat-
form technology with broad utility for monitoring a wide range of analytes from a small blood volume. This
means that, in the future, the multiplexing capabilities of this technology may be enhanced to incorporate other
analytes relevant to neonatal health including but not limited to inflammatory cytokines for detection of sepsis,
potassium ions, calcium ions, and BUN."

Molluscum contagiosum (MC) is a highly contagious skin disease caused by the poxvirus, MCV. It remains
an Unmet Medical Need due to lack of an approved antiviral drug. MC appears as lesions on the body
and face that can spread and last months-years before resolving. Lesions occur most frequently in children
(5%) and immune compromised individuals (5-18%). The infection is confined to the epidermal skin layers;
it is not systemic. Transmission spreads directly from person-person contact, autoinoculation, or indirect
contact with fomites. A principal concern is infection of the eyelids by rubbing skin lesions from distal sites.
Infection of the eyelids is especially distressful and can lead to inflammation of the conjunctiva causing “pink
eye” and follicular conjunctivitis. Current treatments can be painful, cause scarring, and psychological
distress. None of the current treatments that include a range of physical, chemical, and medicinal
interventions are uniformly accepted or FDA approved. No MC approved drug has been developed because
the virus cannot be grown in tissue culture for testing. We have now made 4 major breakthroughs: First,
we identified a protein target (mD4) of MCV that is specific for viral replication. Second, we constructed
a surrogate virus (mD4-VV), providing the first cell-based system for screening compounds against the viral
target protein (mD4) in infected cells. Third, we synthesized a small molecule (7269) that binds a precise
region of the mD4 target protein to cause unfolding and loss of function. However, although 7269 blocks
infection of the surrogate virus, we were unable to improve its potency or eliminate its slight toxicity despite
an intense medicinal chemistry campaign. Fourth, we overcame this impasse by conjugating a peptide
to produce TriValine-7269 that increases antiviral potency 6.3-fold greater than that of unconjugated 7269
with no measurable toxicity. Since the increased potency of TriValine-7269 is not related to an increase in
target binding, it is likely due to cell uptake or stability. The Challenge for future clinical drug development
is that TriValine-7269 has no related conjugated peptide analogs of equal or greater potency to mitigate risk.
To address this requirement, we have synthesized 68 new analogs related to TriValine-7269 (C-Pep1) from
which emerged C-Pep2 & C-Pep3 exhibiting even greater antiviral potency. Our GOAL is to optimize the 3
C-Peps to generate a pre-clinical Lead with the other two as Backups to topically treat MC lesions on all areas
of the skin including the eyelids. Our AIMS are to: (I) Use medicinal chemistry to generate 100 new analogs
of the C-Peps; (II) Screen the chemically modified C-Peps for: validation of mD4-target engagement,
antiviral potency, cytotoxicity, binding the mD4 target; (III) Use 3D Organotypic skin cultures and Liposomes
for developing and delivering advanced C-Peps to treat all lesions, including eyelids; (IV) Assay in vitro ADME
and multiple Off-Target Activities; (V) Initiate pre-clinical development for non-GMP API scale-up and pre-
formulation manufacturing and stability."
10822186,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Older adults in America are living longer, and there are more of them than at any other time in the country’s
history. U.S. adults aged 65 and older are expected to increase from 54 million in 2020 to over 80 million by
2040. Older adults are at risk for poor health in many areas of life, including physical, mental, social, and
financial health. They want to age successfully as they seek information from their health care providers and
publicly available sources. Over 40% of adults use the internet for health information, although there is mistrust
and confusion because the availability of information is generic and scattered through many different
resources. For this Fast Track SBIR project, we propose the Adult Wellbeing Checkup (AWC) - an innovative
and informative assessment and recommendation tool that will help older adults assess their wellbeing in
twelve different domains and then receive personalized guidance (based on a collectively intelligent hybrid
reasoning methodology) on how to improve wellbeing in domains that were low-scoring and want to improve.
AWC will be designed and developed by BellAge, led by Principal Investigator (PI), James Firman, in
collaboration with Yong Choi and Stephen Engels, and supported by Benten Technologies. The specific aims of
Phase I are: 1) Develop a prototype of the AWC with personalized recommendations in two of the twelve
domains from formative research; 2) Conduct a 4-week pilot with 8 older adult care partners (CPs) and 8 older
adult non-CPs from three senior centers to assess feasibility (engagement, usability, and acceptance). The
specific aims of Phase II are to 1) Modify the AWC prototype for commercialization and provide personalized
recommendations for more wellbeing domains, and 2) Conduct a randomized control trial (RCT) with 25 older
adult CPs and 25 older adult non-CPs in eight research sites examining three of the twelve domains (i.e.,
loneliness, physical health, mental health) to significantly improve engagement, self-efficacy, and wellbeing on
one or more domains.
The short-term impact will be the feasibility, acceptance, and engagement of older adults with the AWC
platform. Then, in Phase II, if successful, this study will demonstrate the development and implementation of
personalized guidance can result in behavior change among older adults. Furthermore, the assessment could
improve wellbeing measurement for state-funded programs and organizations, allowing longitudinal data
collection to prompt future funding and development. For future research, we would further develop the
platform to provide personalized recommendations for the remaining nine domains. Ultimately, this service
could be a guidance system and preventative care intervention for many aspects of life for older adults."

Maintenance and regeneration of various organs is dependent upon specialized stem cell populations. These
populations require highly specific environments and external cues to maintain their multipotent capabilities or
specifically trigger expansion and differentiation resulting in growth and development or repairing of the organ
after damage. The advent of stem cell derived enteroid and organoid culture models has given insight into the
signaling requirements of many stem cell populations and allowed for intensive study of the necessary niche
signals that direct behavior.
Previous data has suggested a role for sub-epithelial cells (SECs) in maintaining the intestinal stem cell niche.
Our lab recently described an SEC population in the developing human intestine defined by the unique
expression of F3 and PDGFRA (F3+/PDGFRAhi). This population, which lines the entire crypt-villus axis, can
be further divided by NPY expression into villus localized (NPY+) and crypt localized (NPY-) populations using
both single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FiSH). My preliminary data
has compared single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data and identified differentially expressed genes in
villus-SECs and crypt-SECs, including secreted proteins and receptors, identifying putative novel intestinal
niche factors.
One of the putative niche factors that my analysis identified was HGF (Hepatocyte Growth Factor), which was
enriched in the crypt-base SECs. The HGF receptor c-MET was found to be localized to the intestinal
epithelium in both mouse and human scRNA-seq datasets during fetal development. HGF is well known for its
roles in development, wound healing/regeneration, and cancer in many tissues including the intestinal
epithelium.
My proposal is designed to test the hypothesis that the crypt-based SECs have intestinal niche supporting
function through HGF signaling we will 1) characterize the distinct SEC sup-populations and 2) determine if
HGF is necessary and sufficient to support human intestinal stem cell growth and development in induced
pluripotent stem cell-derived human intestinal organoids (iPSC-HIOs). After HIO survival in media
supplemented with HGF is confirmed, the HIO cultures both before and after transplantation beneath a mouse
kidney capsule will be analyzed to define any differences between the EGF-HIOs and HGF-HIOs."
10824226,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Diabetic cardiomyopathy is a common yet underestimated cause of heart failure and mortality in patients with
diabetes. The underlying basis of this often-fatal syndrome is unknown, although multiple pathways converge
on a common denominator - dysfunctional mitochondria. Understanding how damaged mitochondria are
removed is critical, as the presence of damaged mitochondria leads to rapid generation of reactive oxygen
species which then affect the remaining healthy mitochondria. This leads to wide-spread mitochondrial
dysfunction and cell death. Although damaged mitochondria are believed to be degraded by mitochondrial
autophagy (a specific form of autophagy), we have recently discovered the existence of a novel endosomal-
mediated mitochondrial degradation pathway in cardiomyocytes exposed to hyperglycemia. The suppression of
this pathway is potentially linked to increased susceptibility against diabetic cardiomyopathy. This observation
was possible due to our ability to generate patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from diabetic
patients with (T2DCM) and without (T2D) cardiomyopathy. We found that only T2D cells, but not T2DCM,
exhibited increased endosomal-mediated mitochondrial degradation. However, neither the molecular cues
regulating this novel pathway, nor the functional significance of this endosomal pathway, is established in
cardiomyocytes from a diabetic heart. Thus, the goal of this project is to demonstrate the functional significance
of the endosomal-mediated mitochondrial degradation pathway during diabetic cardiomyopathy and to elucidate
the underlying mechanisms regulating this pathway. Aim 1 will define the functional role of endosomal-mediated
mitochondrial clearance in the diabetic heart by disrupting the function of Rab5 and Rab7, key determinants of
the endo-lysosomal system. These studies will employ multiple innovative reagents, including CRISPR-mediated
Rab knockout and overactivation iPSC lines and a novel inducible, cardiac-specific Rab7 knockout mouse model,
to interrogate the importance of these Rabs in maintaining functional mitochondrial degradation in two distinct
diabetic mouse models. Aim 2 will define the role of VPS34/UVRAG in generating phosphatidylinositol 3-
phosphate (PI3P) required for endosomal maturation and hence clearance of defective mitochondria. We have
supporting data that mTOR is excessively upregulated in selected diabetic patients leading to phosphorylation
of UVRAG, impairing its function to form a complex with VPS34 in generating PI3P for proper endosomal
maturation and mitochondria degradation. Using both genetic and pharmacological methods, we will
demonstrate that maintaining a stable UVRAG/VPS34 complex is a prerequisite for PI3P to mediate conversion
of Rab5 into Rab7 for endosomal-mediated mitochondrial degradation. Collectively, these innovative studies will
illuminate a novel endosomal-mediated mitochondrial degradation pathway as an important adaptive response
in cardiomyocytes when exposed to hyperglycemic stress and pave the way for druggable targets in the future."

Over the last decade, cell based “living medicines” like chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell immunotherapies
have led to miraculous cures in advanced and aggressive leukemias and lymphomas in children and adults.
Prior to their introduction, these cancers were thought to be virtually untreatable, yet multiple clinical trials have
now shown that administering CAR-T therapy can be even more effective than chemotherapy, the standard of
care. Despite its great promise, many barriers continue to limit the potency of CAR-T therapies in treating solid
and liquid tumors, and it is still not clear which biomarkers have the most clinical relevance. Unlike molecular
therapies, such as small molecule drugs and biologics, which can be homogenously produced from batch to
batch, cell-based therapies are inherently heterogeneous, and there are still many unknowns about which
specific subpopulations contained in these “living medicines” contribute to overall therapeutic potency. Clinical
data has consistently shown that the overall immune response is often dominated by relatively few CAR-T clones
that both kill the target and rapidly proliferate after infusion. However, to date it has not been possible to further
quantify these killer, proliferative subpopulations, due to our inability to measure these diverse functions
simultaneously at the level of each single cell. To provide a more comprehensive solution for analyzing CAR-T
potency, Celldom is commercializing a platform that can measure the functional properties of >100,000 CAR-T
effector cells in co-culture format in a single experiment, and then use these functional measurements to make
real time decisions about which cells to retrieve for genomic characterization. Our platform uses proprietary
microwell plates to isolate discrete single cell co-cultures using simple workflows involving only liquid handling
tools and centrifugation. We have built an imager that can maintain the viability of co-cultures over many days,
while continuously monitoring multiple phenotypic parameters, such as cytotoxicity activity, and growth rate. With
support from this proposal, we aim to include additional measurements of cytokine secretions, cell surface
markers, and gene expression. In order to achieve this goal, we need to realize a combination of technical
engineering milestones and immunological assay development milestones. Our engineering objectives are to
apply video action recognition models to improve the accuracy of cytolysis measurements and coculture
detection, and to establish a real-time image acquisition and computer vision data analysis pipeline that allows
clones to be picked immediately at the end of the experiment. Our assay development objectives are to assess
the range and limits of detection for 3 cytokines and 3 surface markers, to add these selection criteria for clone
isolation. We further aim to retrieve high priority clones from specific microwells to analyze the transcriptional
states and clonality of different sub-populations. Once all of these capabilities are in place, Celldom will have the
most comprehensive platform on the market for measuring functional and molecular properties of individual T
cells, which can help identify and further study the subpopulations that dominate the in vivo response."

Dysfunctional sexual behavior, characterized by disturbances in sexual desire, preference, arousal, and orgasm,
is a common, burdensome, and costly health condition. Overweight/obesity puts individuals at higher risks of
dysfunctional sexual behavior; in contrast, underweight/extremely leanness also impairs sexual behavior.
However, how nutritional regimens affect sexual behavior, and the underlying molecular and neural mechanisms
are unclear. Using C57Bl6j wild type mice, I found that leptin rescued the detrimental effects of nutrition
deprivation on sexual behavior in male mice. In addition, weight loss rescued sexual behavior in obese male
mice. These findings highlighted the bidirectional regulation of nutrition on sexual behavior and interestingly, the
nutrition-induced rescue in sexual behavior was only seen in males. Estrogen and leptin are both reported to
signal nutritional status to modulate multiple physiological processes including metabolism and sexual behavior.
I showed that estrogen receptor α (ERα) and the long-form leptin receptor (LepR) co-localized in several brain
regions, including the medial preoptic area (MPA), the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and the arcuate nucleus of
hypothalamus (ARH). To examine the role of ERα in LepR neurons in sexual behavior, I used Cre-loxP system
to generate mice with deletions of ERα specifically in LepR neurons (ERαΔLepR mice). I found that male and
female ERαΔLepR mice demonstrated remarkable dysfunctional sexual behaviors and profound reproductive
deficits. Furthermore, restoration of MPA ERα via stereotaxic injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-DIO-
GFP-ERα into the MPA significantly improved sexual behavior in ERαΔLepR mice in both sexes, without
significantly ameliorating the fertility deficits. This interesting segregation between sexual behavior and fertility
stimulated our interest in further investigating the role of ERα+/LepR+ neurons in the MPA in sexual behavior in
both sexes. The objectives of this proposal are to 1) determine whether ERα in LepR neurons is required to
mediate the nutrition-induced rescue of male sexual behavior, and 2) determine whether ERα+/LepR+ neurons
in the MPA regulate sexual behavior in both sexes. These studies will identify neurobiological mechanism that
ERα and leptin signaling interact to coordinate nutrition and sexual behavior. Results are expected to advance
our understanding about the central regulation of sexual behavior. In addition, the proposed experiments take
advantage of my research skills in mouse sexual behavior (acquired during my graduate studies) and the
strength in nutrition, neural circuitry and mouse genetics (available in my postdoctoral mentor’s group) and will
provide me with a unique training opportunity to acquire new neuroscience skills, including intersectional genetics
and optogenetics. These will no doubt help me move toward my career goal of becoming an independent
research scientist at an academic institution."

Bullying and cyberbullying are highly prevalent forms of aggressive behavior among youth of all ages and have
a wide variety of negative social and mental health consequences. Bullying in all its forms involves persistent
and intentional threatening, aggressive or verbally abusive behavior directed toward others at relative
disadvantage. These behaviors share a similar set of risk and protective factors with early-stage substance use,
therefore a single intervention approach may efficiently address both behaviors. Indeed, a fruitful way to extend
the benefits of evidence-based prevention is to adapt the most effective interventions so they address shared
and unique risk and protective factors for multiple related behaviors. The proposed SBIR Fast-Track application
requests funding to develop and evaluate a multicomponent intervention to prevent bullying behavior by
adapting the evidence-based Life Skills Training (LST) elementary school program. LST teaches youth personal
self-management skills, social skills, drug refusal skills, and other life skills needed to successfully navigate key
developmental tasks, increase resilience, and facilitate healthy psychosocial development. The LST program
has been extensively tested and found to effectively prevent substance use in a series of randomized controlled
trials with behavioral effects reported in over 30 peer-reviewed publications. The intervention for the proposed
SBIR will teach young people how to respond to in-person and online bullying from the perspectives of
perpetrator, victim, and bystander. We propose to develop: (1) bullying-specific classroom sessions to
supplement the existing LST elementary school program; (2) an immersive serious (educational) video game to
provide opportunities for students to apply life skills in preventing bullying and other high-risk situations in a
gamified format; (3) e-learning modules that provide parents with strategies and resources to support anti-
bullying lessons taught in school; and, (4) e-learning modules for educators and support professionals that
emphasize the importance of a school-wide anti-bullying approach that teaches prosocial behavior and
encourages respect for peers. In Phase I, we will develop prototypes of bullying-specific classroom sessions, a
video game level, and teacher and parent training materials to test them for feasibility, usability, and overall
appeal. In Phase II, we will complete the development of all program materials and conduct a rigorous
randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the prevention program. Elementary schools (N=30) will be randomized to
either an intervention group that receives the prevention program or a treatment-as-usual control group that
receives existing school health education. At the end of the initial intervention period, and at one- and two-year
follow-ups, we will compare both groups with respect to changes in behaviors, norms, attitudes, and knowledge
regarding bullying, cyberbullying, and substance use behavior. The goal of this SBIR is to develop commercial-
quality bullying prevention products that incorporate digital health technology and are flexible, effective, and
easy-to-use, and can be widely-disseminated to elementary schools in the US."

The GTPase RAS functions as a molecular “on/off” switch, existing both in GDP-bound (inactive) and GTP-
bound forms (active). Despite functioning as a simple binary switch, RAS is capable of directing complex and
diverse cellular processes, including proliferation, migration, survival, and T-cell development. Recent work
suggests that the ability of RAS to play complex, often conflicting roles in diverse processes results from
differences in cellular context and and/or subcellular localization of its signaling. We have developed a novel
chemical genetic tool–called Chemically-Inducible Activator of RAS (CIAR)–to study the dynamics of the
signaling networks that are mediated by RAS activity. CIAR allows rapid and dose-dependent activation of
RAS signaling with a cell permeable small molecule. With CIAR, we propose to use targeted, quantitative
phosphoproteomics and transcriptomics to study the fundamental dynamic behavior of RAS-driven signaling.
Subcellularly-localized versions of CIAR will also be used to determine the effects of localized RAS activation
on the dynamics of RAS-mediated signaling. Finally, we will explore positive and negative feedback within
RAS-driven signaling pathways by selectively enhancing or inhibiting downstream signaling components."

The All of Us Research Program (All of Us) is a large-scale initiative to collect and study
multimodal data from over one million participants living in the United States (U.S.). Studies
have shown significant disparities in disease prevalence compared to the broader U.S.
population, potentially due to the overrepresentation of traditionally underrepresented groups.
The challenge that limits the representativeness of All of Us to the target U.S. population is that
the data are collected through a non-probabilistic sample design. This proposal aims to leverage
two types of external data resources from the U.S. population to construct reliable Synthetic
sampling Weights (SaW) for All of Us to mimic a probabilistic sample design and improve
generalizability. The first external data resource, National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES), creates a nationally representative dataset with validated sampling weights
and individual-level data made publicly available. However, NHANES’ sample size is relatively
small and can result in under-coverage. The second external data resource, the U.S. Census
and the American Community Survey (ACS), are large-scale nationwide surveys that provide
more but aggregated demographic and housing information about the U.S. population,
compensating for the limitation of NHANES. However, individual-level data are not available.
Utilizing the external data resources available in NHANES, the U.S. Census, and ACS, this
project will develop, assess, and refine Synthetic sampling Weights (DARSaW) to improve the
generalizability of All of Us to the target U.S. population. In Aim 1, we will develop the SaW for
All of Us by leveraging the individual-level data from the NHANES and rich but aggregated
summary statistics from the U.S. Census and the American Community Survey. In Aim 2, the
effectiveness of the SaW will be assessed through case studies, comparing unweighted and
SaW-weighted estimates of obesity, hypertension, and disability. We will iterate between Aims 1
and 2 to refine SaWs at the presence of discrepancy by post-calibrating to broader and deeper
aggregated statistics from the target population. The goal of this proposal is to demonstrate the
ability of the SaW to improve the generalizability of the All of Us data, enabling researchers to
draw valid conclusions about the target U.S. population."

The global HIV epidemic has profoundly impacted public health. HIV affects tens of millions of people worldwide,
including over a million in the United States. While antiretroviral therapy (ART) allows individuals to suppress the
virus and live normal lives, it is expensive, has side effects, and requires lifelong adherence. The need for a cure
has led to the development of new therapeutic strategies. However, large-scale clinical testing is hindered by
the low virus concentration in blood during ART and the lack of sensitive, cost-effective point-of-care (POC) tests
for measuring small changes in viral load on a regular basis. There is an urgent need for a test that can
quantitatively differentiate between individuals maintaining suppression after stopping ART and those
experiencing viral rebound, so as to enable quick detection of rebounds and re-initiation of therapy.
The goal of the project proposed here is to develop a POC-compatible quantitative test for accurate viral load
monitoring that could support large-scale clinical trials of HIV cure strategies. Our approach uses digital loop-
mediated isothermal amplification (dLAMP), which has been shown to provide precise viral load measurements
on raw, unpurified samples. Such capabilities make dLAMP well suited for POC settings. Our collaborative
network, composed of engineers, clinical experts, and researchers, will collaborate to create a groundbreaking
diagnostic platform that addresses major limitations in HIV testing and accelerates progress towards an HIV
cure. By leveraging the combined expertise and resources, we will develop a cost-effective microfluidic
consumable test and reusable assay instrument. Ultimately, this tool will improve HIV management and
eradication efforts.
This project will be led by Fluid Discovery, whose mission is to commercialize point-of-care pathogen diagnostics
based on digital LAMP technology. Through the support of Professor Adam Abate, who will also guide
development of the technology, the company will collaborate with UCSF and the Gladstone Institute
investigators. These include Dr. Charles Chiu (Director of the CLIA-certified Pathogen Testing Lab) and Dr.
Melania Ott (Director of Virology at the Gladstone Institute), who will support the validation process. Additionally,
the project will involve collaborations with Dr. Steven Deeks (Director of the Delaney AIDS Research Enterprise
to Find a Cure, which oversees and invests in clinical trials of new therapies) and Dr. Michael Busch (Director at
Vitalant Research Institute). The project will utilize authentic biospecimens from the SCOPE and RAVEN trials.
Working with Fluid Discovery, this team will apply the technology to demonstrate its utility for HIV load monitoring."
10928743,"Project Summary/Abstract
Individuals with motor speech disorders such as dysarthria are known to show aberrant phonatory and artic-
ulatory precision, which can lead to reduced intelligibility when participating in social and vocational activities.
Among the most common dysarthrias is that associated with Parkinson’s disease, which involves atypical online
modulation of pitch (phonation) and formant frequencies (articulation). Despite high incidence of dysarthria, cog-
nitive decline in this population may lead to a reduced capacity to engage actively with speech rehabilitation.
 The long-term goal of this research is to develop treatment approaches that tap into automatic pro-
cesses to improve intelligibility in patients with dysarthria, including approaches that manipulate auditory
feedback while applying neuromodulation to cortical regions. Toward this end, we leverage the availability of rare
neurosurgical data (Electrocorticography in Epilepsy, Deep Brain Stimulation in Parkinson’s disease) to map out
the cortical substrates of phonatory and articulatory control while accounting for the role of subcortical structures.
 According to prominent models of speech production, deﬁcits in speech motor control are a reﬂection of ab-
normalities in motor circuits spanning cortical and subcortical structures. Experimental perturbation of real-time
auditory feedback concurrent with neuroimaging has advanced the current understanding of the cortical under-
pinnings for typical incorporation of auditory feedback into speech output (“sensorimotor control”). Meanwhile,
investigations of sensorimotor control in patients with Parkinson’s disease have helped elucidate the role of the
subthalamic nucleus within the cortical-subcortical motor circuit in atypical sensorimotor control. Some past stud-
ies have suggested that pitch and formants are differentially modulated in distinct subregions within premotor
cortex, and within the subthalamic nucleus. However, discrepancies across studies have prevented the robust
parcellation of cortical and subcortical structures for the specialized control of distinct acoustic features.
 To pinpoint the neural mechanisms underlying typical feedback-based sensorimotor control, Aim 1 maps out
cortical activity associated with compensatory responses to perturbations of pitch and formants using
electrocorticography in patients with Epilepsy. To isolate the subthalamic nucleus’s role in sensorimotor con-
trol, Aim 2 compares compensatory responses to perturbations of pitch and formants in healthy controls
versus patients with Parkinson’s disease in conditions with Deep Brain Stimulation ON versus OFF.
 The proposed experimental paradigm is signiﬁcant in that it will clarify conﬂicting reports about the specializa-
tion of cortical and subcortical structures in sensorimotor control of pitch versus formants. Evidence for the effects
of neurosurgery on speech outcomes in common motor disorders could directly inform perioperative decisions in
clinical care. This research will have direct applications for the future development of neuromodulation to enhance
speech treatment for patients with Parkinson’s disease. Results could also inform treatments for a range of motor
speech disorders, ultimately maximizing phonatory and articulatory control to improve patient communication."

Recent advances in metagenomic sampling have revealed the diversity of bacterial species in the human gut
microbiome. Dysbiosis within the gut microbiome is a major driver of human health disorders. These conditions
include obesity, leaky gut, sarcopenia, and neurodegenerative diseases. Conversely, supplementing with
beneficial bacteria may treat many health conditions associated with gut dysbiosis. This dietary supplementation
is being commercially pursued as probiotics or postbiotics. Probiotics deliver live bacteria to the gut, which
actively colonize to deliver a health benefit. Postbiotics involve using inactivated bacteria or material derived
from them which confer a health benefit. Postbiotics are emerging as attractive dietary supplements since they
provide a means to bring anerobic strains into the market, given that a vast majority of gut microbes are anerobic.
However, a significant challenge in selecting beneficial bacteria is identifying which isolates might positively
impact health from the thousands of strains that are being collected from either human gut or food sources. Such
a screening task would be very challenging in rodent models as gnotobiotic maintenance is complex, slow, and
expensive. Likewise, in vitro models are limited in relevance and difficult to phenotype human health benefits. In
this study, we propose to develop a fast in vivo screening pipeline using NemaLife’s proprietary high-throughput
platform. Caenorhabditis elegans is a microscopic nematode that feeds on bacteria, which then colonize the
worm’s gut and establish its microbiome. This natural aspect of worm biology allows us to perform life-long and
straightforward gnotobiotic maintenance. In Aim 1, we will take 50 representative bacteria species from four
genera that have proven beneficial effects on human health disorders and test them in worm models of the same
condition. We will examine four phenotypic readouts: healthy aging, sarcopenia, obesity, and leaky gut. These
studies will establish the biological contexts of where the worm is an excellent translatable model for human
microbiome research. In Aim 2, we will build a database of fully sequenced gut microbiome species associated
with positive health outcomes. We will then identify and obtain the 100 most promising strains for human health,
based on their metabolic gene annotations, from this database and screen them in our worm models from Aim
1. This screen will allow us to functionally characterize these strains and identify those with therapeutic potential.
We will then determine how these beneficial strains impact host physiology to elicit their health effects using
transcriptomics. When taken together, the results of this project will validate our screening platform as a cost-
effective and high-throughput in vivo tool for discovering, translating, and commercializing novel probiotics and
postbiotics with high therapeutic potential and known mechanism of action."
10820322,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cutaneous inflammation is a prevalent and often difficult-to-treat manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE) that is driven in part by elevated type I IFN signaling that leads to increased myeloid cell recruitment and
activation, increased keratinocyte cell death, repression of regulatory cell responses, and increased chemokine
and cytokine production. The sources of type I IFN production in cutaneous lesions include recruited immune
cells and skin-intrinsic sources of type I IFNs, including keratinocyte production of IFNκ. The mechanisms that
drive and regulate increased keratinocyte production of type I IFNs remain unknown yet are important novel
targets for therapeutic intervention. Our preliminary data support a critical role for mitochondrial-triggered STING
signaling in the upregulation of IFNB and IFNK transcription that is enhanced by type I IFN production of Z-nucleic
acid binding protein 1 (ZBP1). Upregulation of type I IFNs is paralleled by increased expression of type III IFNs
(IFNλ family) in a similar fashion, and their interplay with type I IFNs may lead to inflammatory responses not
targeted by anti-IFNAR treatment approaches. Our preliminary data support UVB-driven IFNλ 1 and 3 expression
in human KCs, with regulation downstream of UV activation in a manner like IFNK and IFNB respectively. The
contributions of IFNλ to type I IFN-driven immune responses remain unknown. Thus, the next 5 years of funding
of this grant will focus on dissecting detailed mechanisms of keratinocyte IFN regulation with a new focus on
mitochondrial upregulation of type I IFNs in keratinocytes, the interplay with type III IFNs, and the study of type
I IFN signaling blockade in SLE patient skin. Our overall hypothesis is that in the majority of SLE patients, chronic
over-production of IFNκ is perpetuated through an IFN-primed Z-DNA binding protein (ZBP1) and mitochondrial
oxidation-dependent activation of STING that requires IFNβ and potentially type III IFNs to sustain and or amplify
inflammatory signaling. Patients refractory to IFN blockade may have activation of additional signals downstream
of mitochondrial stress that drive persistent inflammation. Three aims are proposed: Aim 1: Dissect the role of
the mitochondria in keratinocyte IFN regulation. Aim 2: Determine the SLE-relevant interactions between
type I and type III IFNs in keratinocytes. Aim 3: Determine how type I IFN blockade changes inflammatory
phenotypes in SLE skin and determine the critical pathways that remain in refractory disease. When
completed this project will identify novel ways of targeting skewed interferon production and uncover novel, non-
type I IFN pathways that contribute to ongoing disease."

obtained using CT but without the need for radiation or iodinated contrast agents. Advancements in medical
imaging and device technology allow minimally-invasive procedures for the diagnosis and treatment of various
disorders. Real-time ultrasound has become an integral aspect of many image-guided interventions. Advantages
of US imaging include the low cost, lack of ionizing radiation and real-time visualization of anatomy and
physiology. Our approach will be to: 1) create an extended aperture 2D transducer (512 by 16 elements) capable
of imaging an extended azimuthal field of 9 cm with in-plane resolution of hundreds of microns (to provide a wide
field of view at high resolution), 2) apply the 2D array to image multiple adjacent planes (to facilitate the view of
biopsy needles or ablations), 3) achieve a 30 volume per second update rate by using plane wave transmissions
to enhance contrast imaging modes and implement novel beam formation algorithms, 4) integrate methods for
aberration correction, and 5) apply this technology in B-Mode, color Doppler, volumetric vector flow imaging and
contrast imaging. The array will be realized using tiled modules that can be switched in a mode-dependent
fashion to accomplish B-Mode imaging, color Doppler and contrast imaging. Over the past 4 years, Stanford and
the University of Southern California have designed an adult extended-aperture abdominal-imaging system and
demonstrated the improved spatial resolution, field of view and contrast that can be achieved. We exploit these
tools here to develop a high-volume rate capability for monitoring liver interventions. Our aims to accomplish this
are to: 1) Create and integrate tileable acoustic/electronic modules to implement signal buffering and multiplexing
and create a large aperture array with elevational focusing. Utilizing newly designed Integrated Circuits (IC)’s
and highly sensitive and wide-bandwidth single crystal transducer material, we will construct individual 2D array
modules with co-integrated transducers and electronics. 2) Optimize the protocols for guiding biopsy and ablation
in phantom and animal studies. A) Create software for imaging of small lesions and microwave ablation. We
will implement singular value decomposition (SVD) based beam formation for aberration correction. B) Evaluate
performance in phantoms and ex vivo tissue. C) Assess speed and accuracy of needle placements. D) Conduct
contrast imaging and ablative studies in porcine liver in vivo. 3) Conduct diagnostic and interventional imaging
studies as a proof of concept. A) Test the protocols to image the liver of adult volunteers and establish the signal
to noise ratio in vivo as compared with phantoms. B) Assess 3D visualization of liver vasculature and lesions in
patients referred for MR or CT imaging of a liver lesion. C) Compare the 3D visualization of ablated zones to
contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) in patients that are referred for liver ablation."
10788421,"PROJECT SUMMARY
CRAC (Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+) channels are pivotal for activation of the Ca2+-NFAT (nuclear factor of
activated T cells) signaling pathway in T cells. Defects in the Ca2+-NFAT pathway lead to immune deficiency in
humans. In addition, blockers for this pathway including cyclosporin A and FK506 are widely used to suppress
T cell functions in the clinic, further emphasizing the importance of this pathway. The major problem with
therapeutic exploitation of the Ca2+-NFAT pathway is that inhibition of this pathway leads to systemic immune
suppression due to its broad role in T cell functions. Our goal is to elucidate mechansims regulating CRAC
channels specifically in local effector T cells that are already migrated to the tissue and develop a therapeutic
method to selectively suppress cytokine production in those cells. During the onset of autoimmunity, naïve T
cells are primed and differentiate to effector T cells at the lymph nodes. Primed effector T cells then migrate to
the site of inflammation, where they encounter self-antigen-enriched milieu and produce maximal levels of
inflammatory cytokines including IFN-gamma, IL-17 and GM-CSF. Our preliminary data now reveal a novel
mechanism underlying regulation of CRAC channels selectively in local effector T cell responses, not in T cell
priming. We find that surface expression of ORAI1, the pore subunit of CRAC channels is limited and a large
fraction of the protein (60%) is intracellularly trapped within vesicles. In effector T cells, T cell receptor (TCR)
stimulation triggers trafficking of ORAI1+ vesicles to the plasma membrane, which is important for sustained
Ca2+ entry and thereby robust effector T cell response. From a targeted screen, we have identified two
components of these ORAI1+ vesicles, NKD2 (naked cuticle homolog 2), a signaling adaptor, and Rab44, a
novel Rab GTPase. Mechanistically, NKD2 gets activated upon TCR stimulation and orchestrates ORAI1+
vesicle trafficking via Rab44. Both NKD2 and Rab44 are abundantly expressed in effector T cells and deletion
of Nkd2 specifically decreased local effector T cell responses without influencing T cell development and
priming in vivo. Taken together, the main hypothesis of the current proposal is that ORAI1 trafficking from the
intracellular pool to the plasma membrane is crucial for high and sustained Ca2+ signaling required for local
effector T cell responses. The specific objectives of this proposal are 1) uncover the role of TCR signals in
triggering of ORAI1+ vesicle trafficking, 2) identify the molecular machinery involved in trafficking of the
ORAI1/NKD2+ vesicles, that includes Rab44, and 3) elucidate the physiological role of ORAI1+ vesicle
trafficking in local effector T cell responses using animal models of neuronal inflammation."

The goal of this proposal is to profile skin immunity and infection response in aging as a function of the skin
microbiome. Older adults have increased susceptibility to a wide range of skin-related adverse events,
including bacterial, fungal, and viral skin infections that can progress to serious systemic infection, skin cancer,
and reduced quality of skin health, including skin barrier function. Different constituents of the skin microbiome
modulate the development and maintenance of cutaneous innate and adaptive immunity. Physical changes in
skin structure not only change the environment conducive to microbial colonization, but also changes the
penetrance of its products to impact local immune function. We recently found that the skin microbiome
remodeled dramatically not so much with chronological age but with frail aging, and we hypothesize that FADS
interacts with cutaneous immunity to reduce skin health and responsiveness to infection. In Aim 1, we will
define aging of cutaneous immunity by evaluating skin immunity, using an innovative microneedle sampling
device, as a function of skin microbiome and frailty in 120 healthy younger adults, healthy older adults, and frail
older adults. In Aim 2, we will use Diversity Outbred mice to model human population-level genetic diversity to
investigate aging of cutaneous immunity and infection response, modeling microbial depletion, microbial
colonization with healthy and frailty-associated human microbiota, and treatment with senolytics and anti-
inflammatories. This work will define how the skin immune cell populations differ in aging and unhealthy aging,
and how the skin microbiome differentially primes skin immunity in aging. These data provide the foundation
for pinpointing influential microbes and immune interactions that may be modulated as a therapeutic or
prophylactic approach, as well as identify risk factors for a range of skin disorders in older adults."

Colloids, macromolecules and polyelectrolytes serve as building blocks for biological and synthetic materials
with microstructures that are often far from equilibrium. Such complexity and diversity give rise to unique
properties with endless potential for innovation. Recent advances in characterizing and precisely controlling
their structure and properties are enabling a wide array of applications from novel delivery vehicles to green
materials to living and non-living systems that may provide insights into the origins of life. Due to the intricate
nature of these systems, their study requires a unique approach involving a combination of experiments and
theoretical analyses. The 2024 Gordon Research Symposium (GRS) and Gordon Research Conference
(GRC) on Colloidal, Macromolecules and Polyelectrolyte Solutions aims to explore the innovation of these
materials and techniques for their characterization, focusing on engineering diverse soft matter systems by
bringing together scientists with diverse backgrounds and expertise. The GRS is a student and postdoc
organized and led conference that takes place the weekend prior to the GRC. The GRC and GRS organizers
have a strong commitment to supporting students, postdocs and early career scientists. These conferences will
also enhance diversity, equity and inclusion by ensuring representation in our invited speakers and discussion
leaders, increasing participation by advertising to professional societies and minorities serving institutions and
a strong commitment to creating safe and welcoming environments. The scientific topics covered by the GRS
and GRC align with the mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and, specifically, the National Institute
of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB). The topical focus of these conferences is colloidal,
macromolecular and polyelectrolyte solutions. These highly engineered materials are used in a broad range of
applications and we have invited speakers that highlight these areas. Sessions that fit into these missions
include 3D printing and additive manufacturing with a focus on biomaterials, novel delivery vehicles, origins of
life with a focus on biological development including disease progression and bio-inspired and biomimetic
materials. Other sessions include speakers that develop new technologies and work that enhances
fundamental understanding that underlies the detection and treatment of diseases. By inviting speakers that
range from fundamental to transformational work we plan to not only showcase NIH relevant and funded
research but also anticipate new connections and collaborations between scientists. Exploiting the GRC format
which provides ample time for informal conversation, a goal of these conferences is to seed ideas that lead to
new projects that would be of interest to NIH and NIBIB."

HPV-associated malignancies include cancers of the cervix, oropharynx, anus, vulva, vagina, and penis. They
cause thousands of deaths in the United States each year. Treatments for metastatic disease rarely provide
lasting palliation and have minimal curative potential. First-line therapy increasingly includes immune checkpoint
blockade in combination with chemotherapy, limiting the options for subsequent treatment. Hence, there is a
compelling need for more effective treatments for advanced-stage disease. HPV-associated cancers harbor the
oncogenic HPV E6 and E7 proteins. These antigens are attractive targets for immunotherapy due to their uniform
expression by tumors and absence of expression by healthy tissues. This expression pattern permits targeting
the HPV oncoproteins without toxicity and with the intent to eliminate cancer cells and cure the patient. Specific
immunotherapeutic targeting of HPV oncoproteins with cancer vaccines has not been effective, likely due in part
to the reliance of vaccines on host T cells, which vary in precursor frequency and functional avidity. We have
developed a new type of treatment for HPV-associated cancers that targets the E7 oncoprotein by administering
high-avidity autologous T cells directed against E7 by a gene-engineered T-cell receptor (E7 TCR-T cells). E7
TCR-T cell therapy has demonstrated safety and clinical activity in treatment-refractory, metastatic HPV-
associated metastatic cancers. In a phase I clinical trial, no dose-limiting toxicity was identified. Clinical activity
included regression of widespread, bulky cancer and complete regression of most tumors in some patients –
including immune checkpoint blockade-refractory tumors. Translational research identified immunomolecular
mechanisms of resistance, which now permits for screening of patients to treat only those whose tumors
demonstrate an absence of resistance markers. This project is for a two-center, phase II clinical trial of E7 TCR-
T cell therapy for metastatic HPV-associated cancers. This trial will leverage the strengths of Rutgers Cancer
Institute of New Jersey and the NIH Clinical Center to implement novel immunomolecular screening, next-
generation (two-week) engineered T-cell manufacturing, and recruitment and treatment of patients from diverse
geographic regions and backgrounds. The short-term goal of this research is to assess the response rate for E7
TCR-T cell therapy in the treatment of metastatic HPV-associated cancers. The long-term goal is to develop a
new strategy to treat these malignancies with the aim of increasing survival and curing some patients. Aim 1 will
determine the response rate for E7 TCR-T cell therapy by conducting the phase II trial. This research will also
further characterize the safety profile of the treatment. Aim 2 will conduct transitional research to reveal the
mechanisms by which E7 TCR-T cells mediate tumor regression and elucidate tumor evasion mechanisms that
can guide next-generation therapeutic approaches and biomarker discovery."

Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), or “Long-COVID” has negatively impacted millions of individuals with regard to quality of life, daily functioning, and ability to work, and has placed enormous demands on the healthcare system. Pain-related symptoms are reported by almost half of all patients with PASC, and yet pain is still not consistently addressed in work-ups or treatment options. Thus, we have chosen to study acupuncture for improving pain, quality of life, and function in individuals experiencing PASC-related pain. These treatments have been successful in treating various types of chronic pain and should lend themselves to similar results with PASC-related pain. Furthermore, acupuncture focuses on treating the whole patient, which makes it uniquely well-suited for a complex condition like PASC that affects multiple body systems. 
We propose an initial study to determine the feasibility of successfully conducting a subsequent fully-powered pragmatic randomized trial evaluating the effectiveness of Traditional Chinese Medicine acupuncture for persistent pain problems experienced by persons with PASC. Acupuncture is a physical treatment that aims to correct imbalances in the body (including inflammation and pain) within a Chinese Medicine paradigm. This study will occur through the University of Washington Post-COVID Rehabilitation and Recovery Clinic at the Northgate Primary Care Clinic site. Our specific aims are to (1) assess the feasibility of conducting a randomized clinical trial comparing acupuncture with usual care alone for reducing pain in patients with PASC; (2) evaluate the overall patient experience with participation in the feasibility trial and solicit suggestions about how the study procedures, documents, and treatment protocols could be improved to facilitate participation and better meet participants’ needs; and (3) revise study procedures, protocols, and instruments to prepare for a fully-powered pragmatic randomized trial. 
Our study is innovative because it focuses on treatments that address whole person health rather than individual symptoms. We believe whole-person-oriented treatments can improve outcomes for patients with PASC when used as adjuncts to usual medical care. This study has the potential to help patients with PASC improve function and quality of life, and to provide PASC clinicians with more tools to effectively respond to their patients’ needs."
10788867,"Phenoloxidase-catalyzed melanization and Spӓtzle-induced synthesis of antimicrobial proteins are
universal insect defense responses against pathogen or parasite infection. In mosquitoes such as
Anopheles gambiae, melanotic encapsulation is effective against certain malaria parasites.
Phenoloxidases are produced as inactive prophenoloxidases (proPOs) and, upon recognition of the
invading organism, activated by a serine protease (SP) cascade. POs generate reactive compounds to
kill pathogens. The SP system may activate proSpӓtzle to induce antimicrobial proteins that destroy
the infectious agents. Some of the clip-domain SPs known as CLIPs may participate in the cleavage
activation of TEP1, a complement-like factor vital for the mosquito anti-Plasmodium responses. Having
successfully expressed >30 Manduca and Drosophila proCLIPs in insect cells, we will use the
baculovirus system to produce 12 A. gambiae proCLIPs as wild-type and mutant proteins with FDNR
substituting their original activation sites. We plan to activate the twelve mutants using Manduca sexta
PAP3 (a FDNR-specific CLIP with >21 substrate proteins from insects) and then determine specificity
of the resulting CLIPs by multiplex substrate profiling. Highly specific and sensitive substrates will be
developed to examine the catalytic CLIPs and, in the next project, explore how melanization is linked
to TEP1 activation and how some catalytic CLIPs are regulated by A. gambiae serpins. We will test 30
possible reactions of SP  SP/SPH/PO/Spӓtzle. Based on the results, we plan to reconstitute a part of
the SP-SPH system for proPO and proSpӓtzle-1 activation. Acquired functional data are to be validated
by in vivo infection tests via collaboration with mosquito parasitologists in the future."

Emergency myelopoiesis (EM) is a rapid response by hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) that is
activated in response to inflammatory stimuli such as severe infection and cancer, wherein HSPCs proliferate
and in increase their output of myeloid cells to replenish bone marrow reserves of those that have been deployed
to sites of inflammation. Accumulating evidence has now shown that following the resolution of inflammation,
HSPCs can maintain an altered epigenetic program over time. This process, termed “trained immunity” is a type
of epigenetic memory that can result in more rapid responses to subsequent inflammatory challenges, such as
infection and cancer. Despite growing evidence of its importance in regulating responses to inflammation, the
cellular players and molecular pathways involved in controlling the epigenetic responses that lead to trained
immunity are poorly understood. In preliminary studies, we performed scRNA-seq in sorted bone marrow
immune cells following challenge with β-glucan, a stimulus which induces trained immunity following a rapid EM
response. This analysis identified robust activation of bone marrow group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) to
produce GM-CSF. Blocking either GM-CSF or deleting ILC2s abrogated the EM response β-glucan. However,
whether ILC2s or GM-CSF promote trained immunity in this model is not known. Based on this data, we propose
that GM-CSF elaborated by ILC2s in response to β-glucan plays a critical role in the establishment of trained
immunity. Here we propose to test this hypothesis by (i) defining the role of GM-CSF in trained immunity; (ii)
establish the role of ILC2s in this system through an ILC2-deficient mouse line; and (iii) determining the gene
expression networks and epigenetic landscapes established by GM-CSF downstream of β-glucan challenge in
HSPCs. Altogether, completion of these studies will fundamentally advance our understanding of the regulation
of trained immunity. Furthermore, as trained immunity is actively investigated as an intervention in the clinic,
modulation of ILC2-GM-CSF pathway could be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of inflammatory
diseases and cancer. Finally, completion of these studies will establish the groundwork for future efforts to
identify key cellular and molecular pathways involved in regulating trained immunity in vivo."
10787066,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Hereditary deficiency of galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT, E.C. 2.7.7.12) activity in humans
can lead to a potentially lethal disease called Classic Galactosemia (OMIM 230400). Despite the life-saving
consequences of newborn screening, early diagnosis, and a galactose-restricted diet, affected women
invariably show ovarian damage and fertility impairment representing the greatest burden of their disease.
There are currently no satisfactory treatments available to prevent this complication. Recently, insights into
the underlying pathophysiology and innovative technological advancements have become available, and
options for curative treatment have emerged. Using this momentum, we aim to develop a treatment to
prevent fertility impairments. We aim to 1) develop a non-viral nucleic acid therapy approach that targets the
ovary and 2) determine the optimal timing to rescue the ovarian function. Folliculogenesis is driven by the
cross-talk between oocytes and granulosa cells. Restoration of GALT activity in these cells could possibly
rescue the ovarian damage.
In this pilot grant application, we will explore a new modality of gene therapy using nanoparticles
encapsulating episomal GALT cDNA within a non-viral expression vector. This will include determination of
the optimal cationic polymer layer for delivery of episomal DNA plasmids expressing GFP or GALT to
granulosa cell lines and the addition of ligands to encourage uptake and promote specificity.
In addition, we will determine the optimal window of opportunity for this treatment. A prenatal origin has been
considered for decades whereas the data currently available, albeit scarce, favor a postnatal origin. There is
undoubtedly early damage, but whether treatments aimed to prevent ovarian damage needs to be started in
the neonatal period, or treating in infancy or adolescence would suffice, is not clear. This will be studied using
the zebrafish model for classic galactosemia that mimics the fertility impairments and is suitable for studies
through development. Zebrafish reproduction is regulated by the brain-pituitary-gonadal axis, comparable
to the human situation. For this purpose, RNA-seq, histology/immunohistochemistry of follicole
development and single cell RNA-seq of oocytes and granulosa cells at 4 developmental stages will
be studied. These studies will uncover developmental stage and cell-specific alterations in the affected
ovaries. Distinctive patterns at the different stages are expected to reveal at which stage(s) damage
can be prevented/halted using ovary targeted gene therapy."
10788836,"ABSTRACT
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for assessing interventions for preventing and
treating cancer, but their external validity is only guaranteed if the trial participants are a random sample from
the target population. Unfortunately, most cancer-related RCTs use convenience samples, not probability
samples, and differences between the trial sample and the target population are likely to exist. If these
differences are related to the effectiveness of the treatment being studied (“effect modifiers”), trial results will
fail to generalize. While observable differences may be assessed and potentially adjusted for (e.g.,
underrepresentation of certain demographic groups), these differences have been shown to not completely
explain the so-called efficacy-effectiveness gap. We posit that unmeasured differences between who chooses
to participate in an RCT and who does not may be an important contributor to the failure of some trial results to
generalize. In this project, we propose to develop a statistical framework for quantifying the potential impact of
unmeasured differences between the trial sample and the target population on trial results. The resulting
sensitivity analysis will bound the potential bias in the treatment effect estimate when generalizing from the trial
sample to a target population. The methodology will be based on our prior work developing sensitivity analyses
in the areas of survey nonresponse and selection bias which similarly consider the issue of differences
between who is in a study sample and who is not. This work will have broad applicability beyond cancer trials,
as generalizability is a universal concern of randomized trials across application areas."

 Fractures are a major public health burden with its associated disability, cost, morbidity and mortality. In
recent years, hip fracture rates are higher than expected and the incidence of vertebral fracture appears to be
rising dramatically, especially after age 75 years. A growing body of research suggests that acidosis, even
when subclinical, directly affects bone and can have detrimental effects on bone metabolism and health.
Acidosis can inhibit osteoblast function and bone formation while promoting bone resorption and breakdown,
thus impairing the bone’s ability to repair microdamage that occurs with daily wear and tear and accumulates
with aging, and potentially contributing to higher fracture risk. The Nurses’ Health Studies (NHS) I and II and
the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) are ongoing large-scale cohort studies with decades of
follow-up and rich dietary and lifestyle data, and archived biosamples. Integrating metabolomics technology
into population-based studies is emerging as a valuable research tool which could provide novel insights into
cellular processes that affect fracture risk. Therefore, this proposal’s goal is to prospectively study the
association between acid-base status, assessed through dietary acid load, plasma bicarbonate level and
plasma metabolites, and risk of incident fracture. We hypothesize that perturbations in acid-base status
through diet-dependent and independent mechanisms resulting in increased acidosis will be associated with
higher fracture risk. We will prospectively examine the association of dietary acid load with risk of incident hip
and vertebral fracture in NHS I and II and HPFS (Aim 1). We will use a nested case-control study of hip
fracture cases (n=650) and matched controls (n=650) within these three cohorts to study the association
between plasma bicarbonate level (Aim 2), plasma metabolites (Aim 3) and risk of incident hip fracture in
women and men. Archived plasma samples collected pre-hip fracture diagnosis will be measured for
metabolites using state-of-the art, high-throughput liquid or gas chromatography followed by mass
spectrometry (LC/MS/MS and GC/MS) platforms. Using advanced computational and biostatistical methods in
metabolomics and high-dimensional data analyses, we will use a targeted metabolomics approach as well as
an agnostic approach to build distinct metabolite signatures using all of the available plasma metabolite data to
distinguish hip fracture cases from controls. Ultimately, we expect these studies to produce new insights into
the development of fractures that may lead to new approaches to their prevention and treatment."

The mission of the U-RISE program at CSUB is to provide aspiring young researchers from
diverse backgrounds authentic and transformational experiences that will strengthen their
acceptance and successful completion of Ph.Ds. in the biomedical, and behavioral research fields
leading to a diverse pool of the nation’s scientists. We will target students from Biology,
Chemistry/Biochemistry, Kinesiology and Psychology providing the technical, operational, and
professional skills necessary to become strong research scientists that will successfully transition
from undergraduate to graduate to the biomedical workforce. Our objectives are to have 100% of
our trainees graduate with a bachelor’s degree in a timely manner, effectively prepare trainees for
interdisciplinary biomedical and behavioral research and beyond by providing a transformational
intramural research experience with dedicated and supportive faculty, increase trainee knowledge
base of the biomedical and behavioral sciences through our series of courses, From CSUB to Ph.D.,
increase critical thinking skills using the Critical Thinking Assessment Test (CAT), and increase
leadership skills and personal growth through various experiential activities including community
engagement/service learning and near-peer mentoring. Program outcomes include closing the gap
in 4-year graduation rates and time to degree between well-represented and underrepresented
students, have 70% of the U-RISE trainees admitted to Ph.D. programs in the biomedical and
behavioral sciences and to impact the success of CSUB U-RISE alumni in Ph.D. programs, as
measured by at least 75% of those entering Ph.D. programs advancing toward or succeeding in
earning their doctoral degrees. The U-RISE program is in complete alignment, and will enhance
the mission of CSUB, which places an emphasis on student learning via a commitment to
scholarship, diversity, service, global awareness and life-long learning. The interdisciplinary focus
of the program will give students an edge in gaining acceptance to graduate school and will provide
the necessary breadth to successfully transition into graduate studies in the biomedical and
behavioral sciences. Ultimately, the nation's preeminence in the biomedical and behavioral
sciences cannot be maintained without tapping into every available source of talent and
perspective. The fact that certain ethnic and racial groups are underrepresented in the biomedical
and behavioral sciences shows that we, as a nation, should do better to provide the tools necessary
to all students that want to become scientists. Relatively impoverished rural and agricultural areas
with large minority populations have a wealth of underutilized talent. CSUB, situated in such a
location, possess this underutilized talent."

Norris Cotton Cancer Center (NCCC), the keystone of the cancer-related activities of both
Dartmouth College, including its Geisel School of Medicine, and Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health,
will participate in the NCI's National Clinical Trials Network as a Lead Academic Participating
Site. NCCC has a long history of leadership in national cooperative group clinical trials, dating
back to serving as an operating center for CALGB, and more recently as a main member of the
Alliance for Clinical Trial in Oncology, NRG, COG, and ECOG/ACRIN. As the only NCI-
designated Comprehensive Cancer Center in northern New England, NCCC currently serves
annually over 5,000 new patients and 30,000 returning cancer patients. NCCC is the specialty
academic center for Vermont and New Hampshire, anchoring a network of 17 community-based
practice sites across the region and receiving referrals of rare and advanced cancers, the target
population for enrollment on innovative clinical trials, from a large geographic catchment area.
Within Dartmouth, NCCC has a central Office of Clinical Research (OCR) which coordinates full
participation in the entire range of available clinical trials. NCCC intends to participate fully in all
NCTN activities, expanding its prior focus on participation in the Alliance. NCCC investigators
are active in many NCTN Operations Center committees, facilitating a bi-directional integration
of NCCC concepts into the NCTN, while NCTN studies will be seamless incorporated into the
NCCC trial portfolio. We anticipate accrual of 55 consented subjects on high performance
intervention for treatment trials and 20 subjects on screening only accruals for treatment or
imaging trials. Care at DH is organized into 17 designated interdisciplinary disease-based
teams which bring together all relevant specialties, 14 on a weekly basis, for new patient
conferences at which eligibility for enrollment on clinical trials is assessed routinely. NCCC
research nurses assigned to these Clinical Oncology Groups (COGs) are responsible for
keeping the teams informed of available trials, and the NCCC clinical trials management system
(Velos eResearch) provides the teams reports tracking current enrollment. While highest
priority is given to translating NCCC science into clinical application, Dartmouth's size precludes
most single-institution studies, and national cooperative group trials are prioritized ahead of
industry-initiated studies for fulfillment of NCCC's clinical research mission."
10792646,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Increased uptake and synthesis of macromolecules is essential to sustain the demands of hyperproliferative
cancer cells. Therefore, developing approaches to limit biomass production specifically in tumors could have
profound implications for cancer treatment. While seminal studies have shown that the universal oncogene
MYC promotes protein synthesis in cancer cells, there is still a gap in our understanding of how MYC molecularly
controls translation during oncogenic transformation. We found that the transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon
receptor (AHR) and its ligand kynurenine, a byproduct of the amino acid tryptophan, are induced by MYC in
colon cancer cells. Our preliminary results indicate that AHR is necessary for the expression of genes involved
in ribosomal biogenesis and protein synthesis in proliferating cells. Our hypothesis is that AHR senses and
responds to tryptophan-derived kynurenine by translocating into the nucleus and inducing the transcription of
genes that mediate ribosome biogenesis and translation in colon cancer cells. Aim 1 will directly test the role of
AHR in protein synthesis in colon cancer cells, using genetic silencing in isogenic lines of human colonic
epithelial cells and of mouse organoids progressed to colon cancer. Aim 2 will establish the contribution of
kynurenine to AHR-regulated protein synthesis and cell proliferation by examining the requirement for
kynurenine for the expression of AHR target genes, protein synthesis, and growth. We will utilize AHR knockout
cells and animals and a competitive inhibitor that prevents the binding of kynurenine to AHR to define AHR-
specific functions regulated by kynurenine. Aim 3 will directly test the importance of tryptophan-metabolizing
enzymes in generating kynurenine and in regulating proliferation of colonic cells. We will determine the effects
of knocking down or knocking out enzymes in the kynurenine pathway to define their requirement for AHR
activity, protein synthesis, and proliferation of colon cancer cells and organoids. This study has the potential to
define a direct physiological role for the kynurenine-AHR pathway in driving increased biomass production and
cell proliferation in colon cancer. Moreover, this study will broaden the understanding of the role of kynurenine
as an oncometabolite. Our findings could become the basis for the development of novel approaches to limit
kynurenine production and AHR activity as a means to treat MYC-dependent tumors."

Western populations collectively responded to historically contingent, society-wide developments in the 19th and 20th
centuries by reducing births to record-low levels. However, a minority of Westerners, largely ethnic sectarian religions,
have maintained pre-transition fertility levels despite exposure to contexts that motivate fertility decline. How have these
populations—conspicuous among them being the Amish—maintained high birth rates? Decades of sporadic research
suggest that high birth and low attrition rates explain the unabated 20-25 year Amish population doubling time. Yet, it is
less clear why Amish women maintain high birth rates and, perhaps more revealing, why births vary so widely among
them, with community-level completed birth rates ranging from approximately 4 to 12. Occasional cross-sectional studies
suggest that multiple variables—including household head occupation, religious differences, and individual status—
predict Amish birth rates, but what these results mean, exactly, remains educated guesswork. This project overcomes past
barriers and delivers new knowledge by making two ground-breaking contributions to Amish demography research. First,
this project develops a large population-wide, time-sensitive dataset that will permanently transition Amish demography
research from limited, single-site, cross-sectional analyses to full-scale, continent-wide, time-sensitive analyses. This
transition will substantially advance the scope and interpretability of statistical predictors of births. This longitudinal
database pulls information from Amish-produced population record books that provide extensive documentation of vital
events, sociocultural information, and geocodable addresses at the household level. These geographically referenced data
will then be linked to publically available contextual data. The launch-point for this database is my cross-sectional Amish
population dataset, which incorporates 71 current record books with information about 54,731 unique Amish households
(estimated at about 270,000 individuals), covering approximately 89.6% of all Amish in North America. The proposed
longitudinal database will use all editions of three major directory sets, piloting the process of eventually incorporating all
editions of all Amish directories. Second, this project will validate the data by testing population growth explanations,
beginning with articulation of population structure trends over time. This project will then test the relative influence of
competing fertility theories by disentangling the effects of Amish-internal versus external structural-cultural forces.
Namely, are birth differences more the product of Amish-internal differences in spite of contextual socioeconomic
development or is birth variation more the product of relative isolation from society-wide structures in spite of Amish
internal demarcations? To test these competing theories, I will employ this project’s internally linked, geographically
referenced pilot longitudinal database in time-sensitive analyses. To achieve these project goals, I propose a research and
training program that will enable me to apply conventional and recent advancements in time-sensitive statistical analysis,
fertility theory, and relational database design and management. In so doing, I will quickly achieve researcher
independence in preparation for career-long management, ongoing development, and analysis of a population database
that has sprawling potential to address many demography and population health questions."

ABSTRACT. Acute and chronic pains originating from the urinary bladder are common clinical entities affecting most females at some time in their lives, particularly as they get older. In an attempt to understand urinary bladder hypersensitivity in a translational manner, this ongoing research project has used rodents to define basic neurophysiological elements of bladder sensation at spinal and supraspinal levels. Using urinary bladder distension (UBD)-evoked reflexes and primary/spinal/supraspinal neuronal responses as experimental endpoints, clinically relevant models of bladder hypersensitivity have been developed. The present application explores the effect of aging on a rodent model of bladder pain that utilized neonatal bladder inflammation (NBI) to evoke many of the phenotypic features of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) with an emphasis on known alterations in opioidergic and corticotrophin releasing factor receptor (CRFR)-related modulatory mechanisms. Three Specific Aims are proposed:
Specific Aim #1: To contrast/compare the effect of aging in rats which experienced neonatal bladder inflammation (NBI) and their controls on reflex and neuronal responses to urinary bladder distension (UBD) and bladder histology.
Specific Aim #2: To contrast/compare the role of endogenous opioid systems modulating reflex & neuronal responses to UBD in both young adult and aged rats which experienced NBI and their controls.
Specific Aim #3: To contrast/compare the role of spinal CRF systems modulating reflex & neuronal responses to UBD in both young adult and aged rats which experienced NBI and their controls.
The proposed studies in rodent model systems will give insight related to bladder sensation and how it is altered by aging while exploring novel therapeutics. An improved understanding of sensory processing related to urinary bladder sensory pathways and their modulation by secondary insults will result in an increased translation of basic science to therapeutics for bladder pain."

 Pigmenting cells (melanocytes) protect vital stem cells and subcutaneous tissues from ultraviolet
radiation, and melanocyte stem cells sustain a healthy population of melanocytes through life. Dysregulation
of melanocytes (MCs) or melanocyte stem cells (McSCs) leads to diseases that significantly affects an
individual's quality of life, including hyper- and hypo-pigmentation disorders, and fatal cancer. Currently,
much is still undefined about the molecular mechanisms for many pigmentation disorders or for controlling
melanocytes or melanocyte stem cells. Our long-term goal is to better understand the biology and pathology
of McSC/MC, and to explore how McSC/MC can be manipulated for preventive and therapeutic purpose.
The objective here is to study the proliferation, differentiation and maintenance of the MC lineage through
dissecting the functions of SASH1 and its associated proteins. The rationale for our proposal is that SASH1
is a novel and not well characterized gene involved in MC/McSC and pigmentation, and therefore
understanding its relevant functions will likely lead to new potential approaches and targets for manipulating
McSC/MC to treat MC-related diseases.
 We identified a mutation in SASH1 (S519N) as causative for an inherited hyper-pigmentation disorder.
Based on our data and literature, we hypothesize that SASH1 plays a critical role in proliferation,
differentiation and maintenance of the melanocyte lineage. We also propose that SASH1S519N disrupts
mitotic function and differentiation of these cells, resulting in the pigmentation disorder. To test our
hypotheses, Aim 1 will define the molecular mechanisms of SASH1 in proliferation and differentiation of
McSC/MC with the patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) model. We will generate patient-
specific iPSC clones from SASH1S519N individuals, and then construct gene-corrected and null isogenic
clones with the CRISPR/Cas system. Using the iPSCs, as well as McSCs and MCs derived from these
clones, we will define the proliferation and differentiation kinetics of SASH1 variants, and exam the
underpinning molecular mechanism for SASH1's functions in melanocyte lineage. We have identified
several binding partners for SASH1. We will further investigate their functional relevance to SASH1's roles
in the melanocyte lineage with genetic, biochemical, molecular, and cellular biological approaches. Aim 2
will use mouse model to study the function of SASH1 in maintenance of the melanocyte lineage. We will
test how SASH1 loss affects proliferation and differentiation of these cells using SASH1 knockout mice.
Thus, we expect our work will have a positive impact with new insights into the mechanisms and new
regulators in the fields of MC and McSC biology along with diseases research associated with these cells."

Diabetic cardiomyopathy is an independent risk factor for heart failure characterized by diastolic dysfunction
and left ventricular hypertrophy. Diabetic cardiomyopathy features striking changes in cardiomyocyte fuel
metabolism, which promote the transition into an advanced pathological state. Alterations in fuel metabolism
include an increased reliance on fatty acid oxidation for mechanical energy production, at the expense of other
substrates such as glucose. The resultant loss of metabolic flexibility can result in reduced cardiac work
efficiency and contractile dysfunction. The cellular mechanisms that drive changes in fuel substrate utilization
are not fully understood, and this deficiency represents a major impediment to the development of novel
treatments. In this proposal, we aim to investigate the utility of a novel peptide – adropin – to reverse the fuel
metabolism defects observed in diabetic cardiomyopathy. In Aim 1, we will investigate the effects of adropin on
novel cellular pathways that regulate glucose oxidation in the heart. In Aim 2, we will examine the role played
by adropin signaling pathways in regulating mitochondrial fuel metabolism. In Aim 3, we will examine whether
adropin is a candidate molecule for diabetic cardiomyopathy treatment in pre-clinical animal models. It is
expected that these studies will elucidate new cellular pathways that are central to the metabolic dysfunction
observed in diabetic cardiomyopathy, and will highlight potential new treatment pathways for this disorder."

 The human genome encodes tens of thousands of circRNAs, of which the translation is essential for
regulating important biological functions, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. Interference
with circRNA translation can lead to tumorigenesis and metastasis of cancers. It is unclear, however, how
disrupting circRNA translation can cause the diseases. Identifying the regulatory components of circRNA
translation can provide valuable clinical insights. However, current technologies cannot distinguish circRNAs
from linear RNAs efficiently, such that the mechanism and molecular components regulating circRNA translation
remain unclear. Thus, it is imperative to develop a technology that can identify the components regulating
circRNA translation with higher sensitivity and specificity.
 I have developed a high-throughput reporter screening assay that can systematically screen and identify
the RNA sequences that initiate circRNA translation specifically. Utilizing the technology, I discovered two groups
of the RNA sequences that specifically drive translation on either circRNA or linear RNA, respectively, indicating
that the regulatory components between linear RNA and circRNA translation are different (Chen et al.,
resubmitted to Science). In this proposed research, I will further adapt and apply this novel technology to (i)
identify and characterize the sequence and protein components that regulate circRNA translation specifically, (ii)
identify the association between genetic variation, circRNA translation, and disease, (iii) characterize circRNA
translation in a tissue-dependent manner systematically, and (iv) build a non-integrative and stable gene
expression platform with tunable expression level and tissue specificity. This proposed research will build the
foundation of my future research as an independent researcher to investigate the regulation and the coordination
between different translation machinery (cap-dependent vs. independent translation) among different RNA
species (linear vs. circular RNAs).
 This work will be performed under the mentorship of Dr. Howard Chang at the Stanford University School
of Medicine, an expert in technology development and RNA biology who has highly-successful track records of
placing postdoctoral fellows into independent academic positions at leading institutions. Further training in
scientific and professional skills will be achieved by utilizing the resources available through the Stanford
University School of Medicine and the Office of Postdoctoral Affairs, which provide an outstanding intellectually-
stimulating environment with all facilities and resources necessary for success. All proposed training will
complement my previous training in RNA biology, technology development, and computer programming and
facilitate my transition to an independent researcher, investigating the functions, regulations and clinical
implications of circRNA."
10815118,"Project Summary/Abstract:
The pathologic accumulation of misfolded α-synuclein (α-syn) in neurons leads to neurodegeneration and
cognitive dysfunction and dementia in a family of disorders designated α-synucleinopathies, which includes
Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) dementia (PDD). DLB and PDD are
clinically similar and share characteristic neuropathologic changes. Recent studies indicate that activation of
poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) contributes to the neurodegeneration induced by pathologic
α-syn through the Parthanatos associated AIF (apoptosis-inducing factor) Nuclease (PAAN) also known as
MIF, where PAAN/MIF is the executioner of parthanatic cell death via its nuclease activity. This form of cell
death has been designated parthanatos to distinguish it from other types of cell death such as apoptosis,
necroptosis or autophagic death. Interference with each step of the parthanatic cascade has been shown to
be neuroprotective in a variety of disease models. Recently, MIF nuclease activity was shown to be required
for neurodegeneration of dopamine neurons in three orthogonal models of PD. Importantly, the role of
PAAN/MIF nuclease activity in the cognitive dysfunction in α-synucleinopathies is not known. Moreover, the
effect of PAAN/MIF nuclease-specific inhibitors in α-synucleinopathies cognitive dysfunction has not been
investigated. MIF has also been suggested to be required for inflammasome activation. MIF possesses both
nuclease and tautomerase activity that act independently of one another. It is not known whether
PAAN/MIF’s nuclease activity plays a role in activation of the double strand DNA sensor cyclic guanosine
monophosphate (GMP)-adenosine monophosphate (AMP) (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) and subsequent
STING (stimulator of interferon genes) pathway and inflammasome activation. What role MIF’s tautomerase
activity plays in inflammasome activation is also not known. Determining whether MIF nuclease activity or
tautomerase activity is required for cGas-STING pathway activation is important since it could direct the
development and use of specific MIF inhibitors to prevent cGas-STING pathway and inflammasome
activation. Accordingly, in this project we will examine the neurobehavior and neuropathology of pathologic
α-syn in the gut-brain model in MIF wild type and MIF E22Q (nuclease-deficient) and MIF P2G KI
(tautomerase-deficient) mice and test whether the brain penetrant MIF nuclease inhibitor, PAANIB-1, can
prevent the spread of pathologic α-syn and cognitive behavioral abnormalities in the gut-brain model in
behaviorally presymptomatic and symptomatic mice. In addition, we will determine whether MIF nuclease
activity is required for cGas-STING pathway and inflammasome activation in pathologic α-syn induced
neurodegeneration and explore the role of neuronal versus microglial MIF nuclease activity in pathologic α-
syn induced cognitive dysfunction and neurodegeneration."

Nearly three million people worldwide are currently living with multiple sclerosis (MS), a complex neurological disease
that primarily affects individuals between 20-45 years of age. MS is characterized by peripheral immune cell infiltration
into the central nervous system (CNS) with associated reactive gliosis, oligodendrocyte (OL) death, demyelination, and
neuroaxonal degeneration. Some of the infiltrates that migrate to the CNS are lymphocytes that target the myelin sheaths of
axons. Existing therapies predominately inhibit adaptive immune cells in circulation; however, these medications are often
not effective in halting the pathophysiology that underlies progressive CNS degeneration in MS, where immune cell
infiltration and activation are minimal. No therapies currently exist to treat this pathology because the molecular
mechanisms by which CNS lesions occur in patients with MS is not fully understood. Since disability in progressive MS is
driven by the chronic loss of OLs and neurons, this study will investigate the distinct degenerative process of both cell types
utilizing relevant models. The ultimate objective of this proposed research is to identify how neurons and OLs die in the
context of MS. Understanding this will help identify therapeutic targets to stop these degenerative processes from occurring
in patients with MS. For the past decade, our lab has studied a novel, non-apoptotic cell death pathway, parthanatos, that
plays an active role in various neurological conditions. Parthanatos-inducing conditions that lead to DNA damage, such as
high ROS concentrations, are pathologically prevalent across many neurological diseases including MS. Herein, our lab has
created a mouse line with a point mutation that selectively ablates the enzymatic activity of the downstream executioner of
parthanatos cell death, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) nuclease, and synthesized a compound that
specifically inhibits MIF nuclease. Both genetic and pharmacologic developments have been shown to mediate protection
of dopaminergic neurons in the alpha-synuclein plaque-forming fibril model of Parkinson’s Disease. These experimental
tools will be used here to assess the therapeutic efficacy of targeting MIF nuclease in the experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS and neonatal-derived mouse OLs following exposure to MS-relevant insults.
My preliminary data suggest that genetic ablation of MIF nuclease in EAE mice led to decreased neurologic impairment
over time. Importantly, genetic ablation of MIF nuclease in EAE mice did not affect peak EAE disease severity or peripheral
immune cell infiltration into the spinal cord. I also determined that genetic ablation and pharmacologic inhibition of MIF
nuclease in EAE mice protected against retinal ganglion cell and lumbar spinal cord neuron loss. I further revealed that OL
precursor cells underwent parthanatos following DNA damage, and that this cell death process was limited by inhibiting
upstream parthanatos enzymes in vitro. Therefore, I hypothesize that neurons and OLs die by parthanatos in MS, and
that inhibition of MIF nuclease will protect against neuron and OL degeneration in MS-relevant models. Collectively,
if neurons and OLs degenerate by parthanatos in MS as indicated by my preliminary data, this proposed research could
establish a pharmacological target that can be inhibited to directly mitigate the ongoing loss of grey and white matter in the
CNS of patients with this disease."

Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with no cure, and there is a critical unmet need for disease-
modifying treatments. We are developing a novel therapy for HD: implantation of human Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Cells
(MSCs) engineered to secrete Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (MSC/BDNF), a growth factor needed in the degenerating
striatal regions of the brain, along with gene editing cargo to specifically reduce levels of production of the mutant RNA and
protein. BDNF is low in humans and mice with HD, and up- regulation of BDNF in the brains of transgenic rodent models of
HD has ameliorated the disease phenotype. Due to pro-survival effects in striatal neuropathology, BDNF is a strong
candidate for neuroprotective therapies. Our labs have also developed targeted gene silencing tools using a novel variant
of Cas9 (xCas9 3.7) that allows for broad protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) targeting. We have demonstrated this platform
is effective in reducing huntingtin when fused to a powerful transcriptional repressor, KRAB. We have demonstrated that
MSCs are an excellent delivery vehicle. We are testing injection via the cisterna magna as a surrogate for spinal cord/CSF
fluid delivery in future patients who might receive this cell and gene therapy product developed by our team. Cellular
Nanoengineered xCas9 Therapy (CellNeXT) combines the beneficial effects of MSC administration to the striata with the
benefits of BDNF production while in combination reduction levels of mutant huntingtin. Unlike BDNF delivery via direct
vector injection or protein administration into the brain, MSCs migrate into the areas of damage and have numerous
beneficial effects. Although optimized MSCs will not persist longer than several months, we hypothesize that the
neurorestorative effects of BDNF will outlast the survival of MSCs. This is supported by animal data from our laboratory and
others. In our double-blinded efficacy studies, intrastriatal delivery of human MSC/BDNF significantly reduced anxiety and
significantly increased neurogenesis in immune suppressed HD mice, with increased survival, in comparison to vehicle
treated HD mice. We have demonstrated that treatment with MSC/BDNF decreased striatal atrophy as compared to vehicle
treated HD mice (PMID:26765769). This recovery may be due to the stimulation of endogenous neurogenesis promoted by
BDNF and enhanced by the secretion of various complementary therapeutic factors by the MSCs. In the planned studies,
we will perform the following studies in support of an investigational new drug filing to the FDA: in Aim 1 we will evaluate
the selectivity and durability of xCas9 in patient iPSC-derived NSC and neurons. In Aim 2 we will assess dose and route of
administration of CellNeXT in our novel HD mouse model. Our studies will define reproducible techniques and methods, at
the level of Good Laboratory Practice, for evaluation of cell and gene therapy candidates to be used in neurodegenerative
disorders. We will be positioned to move the CellNeXT candidate into clinical trials for HD initially, and to assist others in
using the product for additional disorders in the future. We will better define mechanism of action of CellNeXT and will define
potency assays, using reduction of mutant huntingtin and preservation of striatal atrophy as key readouts."

 Pregnancy represents a unique immunological state that has been largely overlooked for decades in the
field of immunology. This HIPC program aims to support the deep immunological characterization and
investigation of immunity during pregnancy to inspire next generation vaccine development to protect this unique

a critical central role in shaping the success of the overall program offering administrative, structural, and clinical
support to the program, nucleating all efforts as well as performing the necessary outreach to collaborators,
funders, and public/private partners. The AC will create digital and live platforms for the free exchange of
scientific information, will serve to facilitate access to samples and data, will support the acquisition of samples
for the program, will support legal agreements for sample and data sharing, will support training/mentorship, and
will function in financial and programmatic management to ensure the success of the overall program. In addition,
the AC will coordinate participation in program evaluation activities, including progress reports, site visits, and
provide additional communication and materials to the NIH as needed. Finally, the AC will also function to
maintain interactive practices that maintain cohesion across the team as well as the entire HIPC, ensuring that
all investigators are engaged in the overall success of the program and ultimately into translating findings for the
development of truly innovative products to reshape vaccine development for pregnancy and other

While traditionally regarded as a generalized tolerogenic state, emerging data suggest that pregnancy is

response are under exquisite chronological control and are accompanied by significant changes in ex vivo 
cellular responsiveness. However, how these immunological dynamics control the systemic immune response 
remains incompletely understood. Accumulating data point to immune vulnerabilities during pregnancy, with

will be recommended throughout pregnancy to drive immunity in largely naïve pregnant women and their infants. 
However, the ability of vaccines to boost immunity in previous infected mothers as well as to boost immunity in

10817740,"Data Management and Analysis Core: Summary
 While previously regarded as a state of immunosuppression, emerging immunological studies conversely
suggest that immune system shifts throughout pregnancy from inflammatory to anti-inflammatory, shifting to
balance implantation and growth of the fetal allograft. Instead, OMIC level investigation has begun to point to an
immunological clock that appears throughout pregnancy that may drive this balance between fetal-protection
and maternal immunity- however the specific mechanisms that contribute to this biology and whether the same
changes occur simultaneously throughout the immune system is incompletely understood. Thus, here we aim to
develop an OMIC level data – integrating measures across the system and using vaccines as a mechanism to
perturb the system in vivo. These datasets will be captured across gestation for the first time, building the
foundational data to understand the immunological switches that occur throughout pregnancy to improve
maternal health, develop novel strategies to treat infertility, to guide diseases requiring improved tolerance, as
well as to improve neonatal health. In addition to assisting Project investigators with application of traditional
systems biology mathematical tools, such as differential expression, enrichment, and clustering analysis, the
Data Management and Analysis Core (DMAC) will develop and employ a spectrum of computational
approaches arising from the realms of engineering and computer science, including machine learning
techniques. We will emphasize modeling frameworks in which multiple features are used concomitantly for
explanation or prediction of responses, as multi-variate correlates of protection. Moreover, these frameworks
can examine how these multiple variables interact, offering potential advances in biological insights concerning
mechanism. Both supervised and unsupervised classes of algorithms will be utilized, permitting two different
perspectives on identifying correlates. The efforts of this Core will be intimately integrated into each of the
experimental Projects."
10817777,"ADMINISTRATIVE CORE (AC) : ABSTRACT
The Administrative Core (AC) of the Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET) is under the
effective leadership of two seasoned investigators with endowed chairs: Trevor Penning, PhD (Thelma Brown
and Henry Charles Molinoff Professor of Pharmacology) and Rebecca A. Simmons, MD (Hallam Hurt Endowed
Professor in Pediatrics). They ensure that the goals of the CEET strategic vision are achieved This vision
elevates the environmental health identity of the CEET at the institutional, regional, and national levels and
promotes team science within and across the CEET thematic areas. The AC guides the formation of flexible
thematic areas, which currently are in: Air Pollution & Lung Health, Environmental Exposures & Cancer,
Windows-of-Susceptibility, and Environmental Neuroscience. Investigators committed to these themes are led
by leaders of international repute in their respective areas. The AC provides oversight to the use of the Integrative
Health Sciences Facility Core (IHSFC), the Translational Biomarker Core (TBC) and the Exposure Biology
Informatics Core (EBIC) to ensure they address the needs of the thematic areas and the CEET investigator. The
AC encourages communication, interaction, involvement and exchange with the Community Engagement Core
(CEC) to bring community concerns to the attention of thematic area investigators and the IHSFC. Evaluation
and guidance in decision making processes is overseen by four committees, the Internal Advisory Committee,
the Executive Committee, the Directors Council and the External Advisory Board. Reporting and fiscal
management are supported by an experienced Center Administrator and Grants Manager. A central component
of the AC is to cultivate the careers of Early-Stage Investigators (ESI) to establish them as the next generation
of environmental health (EH) scientists. Our philosophy is that environmental health science is unique among
the biomedical sciences since it spans diverse interdisciplinary expertise ranging from mechanistic toxicology,
epidemiology, exposure science, and translation to patients, communities, and policy makers. In addition,
successful EH scientists are increasingly faced with “Big-Data”, and how to transform such data into knowledge
which requires familiarity with bioinformatics tools and the advances being made in computational science,
machine learning and AI. Our Environmental Health Scientist Support Program is designed to provide a
transformative experience so that our ESI will be equipped with the tools for success as the next generation of
EHS scientists. The AC also builds capacity by bringing senior investigators into the CEET who are addressing
environmental health problems for the first time in their careers. In this manner the AC is responsive to the NIEHS
strategic plan which stresses stewardship of resources and building the professional pipeline."
10817779,"INTEGRATIVE HEALTH SCIENCES FACILITY CORE (IHSFC): ABSTRACT 
The IHSFC is the entity that enables CEET investigators to perform translational environmental health research 
that impacts individuals and communities. Its mission includes (1) support of the translation of basic science 
observations that relate environmental exposures to adverse outcomes into human studies that detect, prevent 
and/or manage diseases induced or exacerbated by these exposures and (2) to translate EHS questions derived 
from the community into testable hypotheses that can be addressed with human studies. Services provided by 
the IHSFC to CEET investigators include: (a) Human Studies Design and Performance Services, (b) Population 
Exposure Services, (c) Pre-clinical and Human Exposure Laboratories, (d) the CEET Virtual Biorepository and 
(e) Biostatistics Services. The Population Exposure Services now has expertise in GIS technology, ArcGIS 
tools, cartographic mapping, geospatial analysis to measure the external exposome. Population science-based 
projects that require biomarker support in the study design are referred to the Translational Biomarker Core, and 
those that generate “big-data” in their study design are referred to the Exposure Biology Informatics Core. The 
IHSFC acts as a bridge to the Community Engagement Core (CEC) and communicates in a bi-directional manner 
to formulate community-based questions and concerns into specific hypotheses for CEET investigators to 
address by research and communicate results of the studies back to community members. Studies supported 
by the IHSFC include those involving the integrated thematic areas of Air Pollution & Lung Health, Environmental 
Exposures & Cancer, Windows-of-Susceptibility and Environmental Neuroscience, as well as novel studies 
initiated via pilot projects. Over the past four years, the IHSFC has supported 51 separate studies involving 28 
different CEET investigators that have generated 46 publications. Efforts by the IHSFC will ultimately result in 
achieving Precision Public Health (PPH) - the prediction of who is at risk of exposure, who is at risk for disease,

10817780,"The Translational Biomarker Core (TBC) supports exposure assessment conducted in the Center of
Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET) described in the Strategic Vision. The Core uses bioanalytical
methods to measure biomarkers of exposure and effect, disease onset and progression, and therapeutic
response for diseases of environmental etiology. The TBC employs rigorous mass spectrometry (MS)-based
methodology to identify biomarkers in cell-culture based models, in animal models and in population and patient
cohorts studies designed in the Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core (IHSFC). Analytes measured are metal
ions, small biomolecules, proteins, as well as targeted and untargeted metabolomes as reporters of the
“exposome”. The TBC recognizes the need to relate phenotypic changes in biomarkers with either changes in
the transcriptome or with genetic variants and this is achieved by data integration performed by the Exposure
Biology Informatics Core (EBIC). The integration of genomic, proteomic and metabolomics biomarkers offers the
promise to deliver new diagnostic and prognostic indicators. Our goal is to translate findings to improve
environmental health in vulnerable populations or individuals which we call Precision Public Health
(PPH). The TBC is equipped with state-of-the art ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC)-MS and
UPLC-high resolution (HR) MS instrumentation. It is also equipped with inductively coupled plasma (ICP)-MS
for heavy metal analysis with speciation. Many LC-MS assays use stable-isotope dilution (SID) LC-MS as the
gold standard for precision and accuracy and many of the assays cannot be performed elsewhere in the world.
The Core will perform the following aims. In Aim 1: we will provide highly sensitive and specific assays to CEET
investigators to analyze biomarkers of exposure and effect in model systems and in biofluids from population
cohorts and patients. In Aim 2: we will support the CEET thematic areas in Air Pollution & Lung Health;
Environmental Exposures & Cancer, Windows-of-Susceptibility; and Environmental Neuroscience with services
and enable biomarker discovery using proteomics and metabolomics approaches. In Aim 3: we will develop new
assays for the thematic areas and prioritize services based on CEET investigators needs. In Aim 4: we will
provide analytical support for pilot-project recipients and for preliminary studies in environmental health sciences.
In Aim 5: we will provide access and training to use state-of-the art analytical equipment and software, including
the new ICP-MS instrument for metal analysis. In Aim 6: we will integrate the TBC services with those of the
EBIC and IHSFC so that human subject research is seamless; and in Aim 7: we will facilitate biomarker
education for CEET investigators and their trainees through monthly training sessions and annual workshops."

10818324,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Proper emotional responses are characterized by the dynamic interplay of two major forces: excitation and
inhibition. A current belief is that dysfunction of inhibition, mediated by local GABAergic interneurons, leads to a
wide range of psychopathologies including phobias and anxiety disorders. A well-established principle of the
circuit organization underlying emotional learning is that inhibition is local while excitation is both local and long-
range. Specifically, a considerable amount of research on cortico-amygdala communication (coordination of
sensory input between the auditory cortex and the lateral amygdala) relies on the reductionist view that the
auditory cortex transmits only excitatory signals. However, it has long been known that long-range GABAergic
neurons are important circuits element in many brain areas, such as the spiny projection neurons in the
striatum and the Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum. Therefore, despite the fact that the existence of cortical
long-range GABAergic neurons has been proven anatomically, previous studies have primarily focused on the
local circuit organization of GABAergic interneurons, and inhibition is frequently described as being exclusively
local. A growing body of evidence from our lab and others indicates that many of these long-range GABAergic
projections arise from neurons expressing somatostatin, parvalbumin, and more recently from vasoactive
intestinal peptide. Since somatostatin neurons form synapses primarily on the distal dendrites of target neurons,
it has been suggested that this subpopulation of GABAergic cells plays a critical role modulating the plasticity of
incoming sensory inputs. Importantly, strong preliminary evidence from our labs show that somatostatin-
expressing neurons project to the lateral amygdala (CLA-Som). This proposal aims at determining the circuit
organization and behavioral relevance of CLA-Som neurons in fear learning driven by auditory signals.
Specifically, this proposal will dissect the CLA-Som microcircuits and behavior responsible for cortical amygdala
communication answering the following questions: What are the anatomical, electrophysiological, and gene
expression properties of CLA-Som neurons? What is the impact of CLA-Som neurons on the amygdala network and
which are the circuit mechanisms through which they produce inhibition? Which are the behavioral conditions that
recruit CLA-Som neurons and their role in fear learning? These questions will be investigated using retrograde and
optogenetic labeling, specific neuronal-tagging-physiological recordings, in vivo patch clamping and linear probe
recordings, calcium imaging in freely moving mice, and pathway selective chemogentic tools during actual
learning. Discoveries from this work will be significant because they will provide foundational knowledge
regarding cortical modulation of fear learning, describe a new GABAergic cortical-amygdala pathway, and
provide new therapeutic targets for neuropathologies involving anxiety and phobias."

prediction and prevention of life-threatening anthracycline chemotherapy cardiotoxicity in older
adults with lymphoma through: 1) improved prediction tools, 2) analysis of current
cardioprotection use and 3) ascertainment of patient and provider treatment preferences. The
candidate is an Assistant Professor at Tufts University School of Medicine and the Medical
Director of the Cardio-Oncology Program in the Division of Cardiology at Tufts Medical Center.
Under the mentorship of Dr. David Kent and Dr. Susan Parsons, researchers in the Institute for
Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies at Tufts Medical Center, the training plan builds on
the candidate's prior clinical and research experience to develop expertise in 1) designing
impactful cardio-oncology outcomes studies using large administrative databases; 2) oncology
clinical trial design and 3) qualitative and decision analytic research methods. Each year in the
US, more than 40,000 individuals 65 years and older are diagnosed with lymphoma with
anthracycline-containing regimens recommended as first-line treatment in the majority of
lymphoma subtypes. While anthracycline chemotherapeutic agents help induce lymphoma
remission, they also increase the risk of heart failure (HF). These effects are worsened in older
adults, as age is a potent risk factor for HF in both non-cancer and cancer populations.
However, omission of anthracyclines, even in elderly patients at high risk of toxicity, may be
associated with worse outcomes. Thus, strategies to better predict and prevent anthracycline
cardiotoxicity are needed to improve outcomes in older patients with lymphoma. Small
randomized trials in predominately non-lymphoma populations have identified several promising
strategies to prevent HF in patients receiving anthracyclines; however, neither clinical practice
guidelines nor the FDA endorse any of these therapies due to insufficient evidence for the
prevention of HF in newly diagnosed adults with lymphoma. The objective of this proposal is to
advance the science of anthracycline cardiotoxicity prediction and prevention by: 1) developing
and validating a HF risk prediction model in older individuals with newly diagnosed lymphoma;
2) determining which cardioprotective strategies are currently used in practice and 3)eliciting
treatment preferences for cardioprotection from patients and providers. This research will lead
to improved knowledge of anthracycline cardiotoxicity prevention, provide preliminary data for a
study of cardioprotection in high-risk individuals with lymphoma and provide the candidate with
the necessary skills and experience to become a successful independent investigator."

young people in the United States (US). ENDS heat and vaporize a nicotine-containing liquid to produce an
inhalable aerosol mist. While generally considered less harmful than combustible cigarettes, ENDS use
exposes users to dependence-producing nicotine and respiratory and cardiovascular toxicants such as
aldehydes. Flavor is a major factor in getting young people to use ENDS, thus limiting flavors to menthol and
tobacco for prefilled cartridge ENDS “pod mods” was the first major action taken by the FDA to reduce the
spread of ENDS among young people. Menthol flavor, however, can present a potential risk given its
increasing popularity among young people in the US, and its puffing and nicotine-enhancing properties. Yet,
the extent of menthol’s ability to affect users' experience and puffing patterns, and how these affect
dependence, exposure to toxicants, and clinical outcomes continue to be understudied. Such evidence will be
critical to the FDA's ability to set further regulatory standards to reduce ENDS potential harm. Our team of
experts in tobacco regulatory science will apply clinical and analytical laboratory methods to address this gap
in evidence by conducting a 2x2 (pre-post x menthol vs. tobacco flavor) crossover clinical lab study. We will
recruit current/past month ENDS users (n=200, 21-35 yrs), who will come to the lab for two sessions and use
their ENDS once with menthol and once with tobacco flavors. While we apply standard and well-tested lab
models suitable for regulatory-related research, we have supplemented these with cutting-edge puffing robot
technology to detect ENDS-associated emissions of toxicants. The proposed studies will answer two key
regulatory questions consistent with FDA’s focus on the role of flavor in tobacco products’ addiction and
toxicity; 1) compared to tobacco flavor, does menthol carry additional risk by enhancing puffing, abuse liability,
and toxicant exposure in ENDS users, and; 2) is this effect more pronounced among high dependence
compared to other users. Other outcomes such as harm perception, satisfaction, clinical responses, intention
to use or quit, and group comparisons such as according to race, and sex will allow the FDA a comprehensive
assessment of the pros and cons of regulating mentholated ENDS for different segments of the society. Such
evidence will help advance FDA regulatory policies with the potential to reduce ENDS harm."

Adult epithelia regenerate during adult life due to the constant activity of stem cell pools. Stem cells maintain
tissue homeostasis and repair injury by close communication with their tissue environment, known as ""niche.”
Niches are complex, structured arrays of different cell types that guide tissue stem cell dynamics. The ultimate
goal of understanding epithelial stem cell regulation is to repair or replace cells or organs damaged by injury,
disease, and aging. The strategies vary from generating cell types and tissues in a dish for transplantation
purposes to directly stimulating the damaged organ in the living organism. This field has been exponentially
growing for the past decade. Tissues such as human skin and cornea have already been grown in 3D cultures
and used in clinics to fight otherwise incurable medical conditions. The GRC on Epithelial Stem Cells and Niches
will focus on comparative principles of adult epithelial stem cell dynamics and niche signaling in the homeostasis
of different tissues. This conference will include work on the molecular control of stem cell function from the
epidermis and its appendages, intestine, lung, mammary gland, cornea, prostate, and emerging work from other
epithelial tissues. All model organisms are welcome. This GRC has held meetings in 2016, 2018, and 2022.
We will continue to bring in both new and veteran speakers to allow a variety of participants to contribute to this
exciting meeting over the coming years. In particular, for the 2024 meeting, we have built a scientific program
that emphasizes key cutting-edge areas in epithelial biology, including organoid techniques, imaging and single-
cell analysis, bioengineering, metabolism, modeling disease, and mechanobiology. In addition, we will support
the attendance of graduate students, postdocs, and early career scientists as they make their way into this
exciting field of study by hosting a GRS in the two days prior to this GRC.
A critical feature of the GRC’s scientific mission is to engage the next generation of scientists. We are continuing
our two-day Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows that will precede
this GRC. The GRS will allow students and fellows to share and discuss unpublished data and technical
breakthroughs, favoring collaborative efforts and sparking provocative hypotheses to be discussed on the floor
of the main conference. Furthermore, the participants will have the opportunity to establish tight professional
relationships from which they will benefit throughout their careers. GRS participants will be expected to stay for
the GRC, further contributing to the educational value of this conference."
10817309,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Variants of SARS-CoV-2 continue to emerge with mutations in Spike that cause increased resistance to
monoclonal antibodies and vaccines. These variants underscore the need for more universal antiviral
approaches, such as targeting conserved regions in Spike and utilizing more broadly reactive Fc-mediated
immune functions. Spike contains highly conserved regions in the S2 domain which may be an attractive target
for the design of inhibitors. These regions are thought to be exposed when S2 undergoes large conformational
changes to mediate membrane fusion and viral entry. Molecular dynamics simulations have modelled this
process in silico, structural detail is lacking in situ which leaves a gap in our understanding of viral entry and may
preclude further inhibitor development. Spike can also be targeted by antibody Fc effector functions such as
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Antibody Fc effector functions against Spike have been shown to be
more broadly reactive and longer lasting in patients than virus neutralization. Eliciting stronger Fc-mediated
immunity is therefore an important consideration in the design of immunogens and antibody therapies. However,
Spike-IgG-Fc receptor complexes in native membranes have never been described at the molecular level which
makes it difficult to define the structural correlates of Fc effector functions. The overarching goal of this proposal
is to investigate the conserved Spike S2 domain and its inhibition during membrane fusion and Fc effector
functions targeting Spike within native membranes. I hypothesize that Spike-host receptor interactions in native
membranes are key vulnerabilities that can be targeted through antibody Fc effector functions and inhibitors to
the conserved S2 domain. To test this hypothesis, I have developed a system to observe Spike-host receptor
interactions in situ by presenting them on opposing virus-like particles (VLPs) and monitoring their interactions
with cryo-electron tomography (cryoET). In Aim 1, I will investigate the conserved S2 domain during membrane
fusion by arresting the membrane fusion process at different stages. My preliminary data show how temperature
arrests and inhibitors stabilize prefusion Spike and S2 intermediate structures in situ to provide a unique window
into viral entry. Further, my data suggests that multivalent inhibitor cross-linking of S2 intermediates may be a
key antiviral strategy to disrupt the cooperative arrangements of S2 that orchestrate membrane fusion. In Aim 2,
I will identify structural correlates of Fc effector functions by determining how antibody Fc accessibility and the
ability to cluster Spikes and Fc receptors on membranes affect Spike-antibody-Fc receptor complex formation.
In preliminary data, I have visualized these complexes in situ in unprecedented molecular detail using cryoET. I
have also developed a method to directly visualize and quantify antibody-mediated Spike clustering on virion
membranes. Collectively, these data will provide detailed molecular insight into Spike-mediated membrane
fusion and Fc-mediated effector functions against SARS-CoV-2 to guide the development of pan-coronavirus
inhibitors and immunogens."
10824334,"Abstract
Bipolar disorder is a serious chronic condition, and there is great interest in understanding brain-based
mechanisms that contribute to disorder symptoms. In this proposal, we focus on one promising candidate:
efficiency of evidence accumulation (EEA). EEA is measured in specialized models from computational
psychiatry, and it quantifies a basic neurocognitive ability to accumulate information from a stimulus in noisy
conditions in order to select appropriate responses. Substantial reductions in EEA are found in bipolar
disorder, as well as other major psychiatric disorders, and they contribute to impulsivity and disease severity.
There is a critical gap in knowledge, however: At the current time, we know little about the brain mechanism
that produce reduced EEA in bipolar disorder, or in any other psychiatric disorder.
In this project, we address this gap using the methods of network neuroscience. Substantial evidence from
large datasets strongly supports a flexible network reconfiguration model of EEA. This model says EEA
depends on the brain’s ability to adaptively reconfigure connectivity patterns of brain networks across cognitive
demands and task contexts. The model suggests the novel hypothesis that reduced EEA in bipolar disorder
arises from deficits in flexible network reconfiguration. We test this hypothesis with U. of Michigan’s unique
Prechter Longitudinal Study of Bipolar Disorder (headed by Co-I McInnis). We study 130 healthy adults and
130 adults with bipolar disorder, who complete a battery of behavioral tasks to measure EEA and a battery of
neuroimaging tasks optimized to measure flexibility of brain network reconfiguration.
A centerpiece of our approach is the use of brain basis set (BBS), a multivariate predictive modeling
framework. This method lets us “summarize” tens of thousands of changes in connectivity patterns across the
brain in terms of a modest number of basic reconfiguration components. BBS lets us identify what networks
reconfigure as well as how much they reconfigure. Using BBS, we will quantify brain network reconfiguration
deficits in bipolar disorder. We in addition link deficits in EEA and reduced brain network reconfiguration
specifically to an impulsive/affectively-unstable subtype of bipolar disorder and to impulsivity factor scores.
Finally, we elucidate the etiology of deficits in task-evoked brain network reconfiguration. We use multivariate
methods to delineate how reduced task-evoked network flexibility arises from alterations in the brain’s task-free
functional and structural architecture.
EEA is a computational metric that rigorously quantifies core neurocognitive deficits in bipolar disorder. This
project leverages computational psychiatry, network neuroscience, and multi-modal imaging to delineate brain
network mechanisms that underpin EEA. Success here lays the foundation for a broader network neuroscience
research program examining impairments in reconfiguration/flexibility of brain networks across multiple
disorders, with the aim of pinpointing etiology and identifying potential interventions."
10824512,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Technology Core (Core D)
An overarching goal of this proposal is to study neutrophil heterogeneity in the context of pulmonary infection
and inflammation, and how neutrophil heterogeneity may influence injury and repair in both lung and airway
diseases. To accomplish this complex matrix, we will need to provide ground truth assessments of neutrophil
profiles to fully resolve their heterogeneity, alongside cohort level targeted assessments of neutrophil profiles
linked back to patient phenotypes and disease outcomes. The Technology Core will support this by first defining
compartmental (blood, airway, tissue) neutrophil heterogeneity through novel spatial biology approaches. Then
we will apply a cascade approach to profiling by leveraging existing single-cell sequencing libraries with new
spatial transcriptomics and proteomics datasets to guide targeted panel development and cohort level
assessments of neutrophil heterogeneity. This will enable optimal and efficient integration of Projects 1 and 2
with Cores B and C to accomplish the overarching goal of this proposal – linking neutrophil heterogeneity to
disease phenotypes and outcomes. The Technology Core will accomplish this through three specific aims: 1)
Unbiased spatial transcriptomics and proteomics of lung and airway tissue will fully define tissue neutrophil
heterogeneity in the context of tissue immune and epithelial heterogeneity across the spectrum of lung and
airway disease. 2) Targeted compartmental immunophenotyping of neutrophils in the blood, airway, and
pulmonary tissue at the cohort level will be accomplished through 10x Genomics Flex kit panels, multiparameter
flow cytometry panels, and custom spatial plex panels, developed and guided by deep clinical and molecular
phenotyping from Core B, physiology read outs from Core C, and unbiased spatial profiling. This will allow for
deeper phenotyping and fully resolve associations between cohort level neutrophil heterogeneity and disease
outcomes. 3) Spatial microbe and viral profiling, through custom probe technology, will be developed and applied
to assess neutrophil-pathogen interactions and how this governs microenvironmental inflammation and/or
fibrosis in Projects 1 and 2. Core D will be led by Parambir S. Dulai, Director of Precision Medicine and Spatial
Biology in the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at Northwestern University, who has successfully
incorporated these approaches to study mucosal neutrophils and spatial immune-microbe interactions in colitis
and applied this workflow for multi-center collaborative consortiums. Core D will be further supported by the
expertise of Hiam Abdala-Valencia, Director of Integrative Genomics Metabolomics Core at Northwestern
University, and Max Seibold, Director Computational Biology Program at University of Colorado."
10824515,"PROJECT 2 ABSTRACT: Asthma is the most common chronic lung disease worldwide. Importantly, over half
of the $3.1B spent in the U.S. each year on asthma health care costs derive from less than 10% of patients,
those who experience severe disease. Roughly, half of patients with severe asthma exhibit eosinophilic airway
inflammation driven by type 2 (T2) cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13). T2 inhibitor drugs are highly effective in
blocking exacerbations among T2 patients with eosinophil-predominant disease. However, the remaining 50%
with non-T2 disease are without treatment options and have poorly understood pathobiology. This represents
the greatest unmet need in asthma. We have found non-T2 asthma includes those with interferon-γ-driven T1
and IL-17-driven T17 inflammation. A central feature of these T1 and T17 endotypes is persistent airway
neutrophilia, accompanied by airway obstruction and remodeling. Moreover, we find that a subgroup of T2
patients also exhibit airway neutrophilia. At National Jewish, we have integrated translational research
infrastructure into our high-volume clinical asthma program, allowing for the collection of airway epithelium and
biopsies, bronchoalveolar lavage, sputum cells, and blood from patients with severe asthma. These biosamples
collected from well-phenotyped patients provide the opportunity to evaluate mechanisms controlling the
infiltration, activation, and function of airway neutrophils in severe asthma. Here, we challenge the notion that
neutrophils are a static, homogeneous population, playing a simple pathogen response role in the airway. Rather
our data suggest that neutrophil subsets could be differentially recruited to, and programmed by, the airways of
T2, T1, and T17 asthmatics, through their expression of different combinations of neutrophil chemoattractant
genes (CXCL1/3/8, C3), survival/maturation genes (CSF3), and activation genes (IFNG, IL17). At the same time,
we find that neutrophils are potent producers of cytokines (e.g. IL-1α/β, IL-6) that induce airway remodeling and
epithelial dysfunction. Therefore, we hypothesize that airway recruitment and mucosal programming of
neutrophils in severe asthma occur in a T2, T1, and T17 endotype-specific manner, resulting in unique neutrophil
inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and proteolytic activities that drive airway epithelial remodeling. To test this
hypothesis, we will perform single-cell and spatial transcriptomic sequencing of circulating and airway neutrophils
from well-phenotyped severe asthma patients. These in vivo molecular data will be paired with data from ex vivo
functional assays and from the modeling of neutrophil-epithelial circuits using airway organoid cultures. In Aim 1
we will determine whether T2, T1, and T17 airway mucosal niches direct differential recruitment of circulating
neutrophil heterogeneity through CXCL1/3/5/8, C5, and LTB4. In Aim 2 we will determine the role of T2, T1, and
T17 airway mucosal programming factors (CSF3, IFN-γ, and IL-17) in the modulation of neutrophil activation and
function. In Aim 3 we will determine neutrophil inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and protease activities, which
lead to epithelial remodeling and dysfunction in T2, T1, and T17 airway mucosal niches."
10824574,"PROJECT ABSTRACT - OVERALL
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic highlighted the urgent need for better understanding of the mechanisms controlling
broadly protective immune responses to rapidly evolving viral pathogens and generating vaccine candidates
able to elicit such responses. The Washington University Cooperative Center on Human Immunology (WashU-
CCHI) application (Mechanisms of Immune Protection Against Respiratory Viruses) proposes a
comprehensive research plan towards two main goals: (a) defining the mechanisms of germinal center
persistence after vaccination in humans and how germinal center dynamics impact engagement of de novo B
cells and generation of robust CD4+ T cell, long-lived memory B cell, and bone marrow plasma cell responses
(Project 1); (b) determining the functional caliber of systemic and mucosal immune responses to vaccines and
infection and how these impact durability, breadth, and protection (Project 2). Three Cores will synergize with
the two research projects to support the successful completion of the research aims. The Administrative Core
(Core A) will manage the consortium, coordinate cross-project activities, and create the structure and
environment needed to accomplish WashU-CCHI’s goals. The Clinical Core (Core B) will provide the clinical
and statistical expertise to support the design and conduct of the human subjects’ research studies conducted
under Projects 1 and 2. The Proteomics Core (Core C) will capitalize on an array of unique technologies for
the interrogation of the circulating antibody protein and B cell repertoires in samples collected under Projects 1
and 2. The integrated and synergistic activities across these Projects and Cores will drive the successful
completion of the WashU-CCHI’s ambitious research agenda, enabling achievement of our long-term goals of
providing key insights on human immune responses and informing evaluation of new mucosal vaccines targeting
the human respiratory tract against existing and emerging respiratory viral pathogens."
10825209,"To support the research goals of our CCHI, the Clinical and Biostatistical Core proposes to continue long-term
follow up of our established COVID-19 cohort of 747 patients over the next 5-year grant cycle. The unique
features of COVID-19 immunity can be explored in this cohort, which presents an incredible opportunity to
advance mechanistic insight into the induction of innate and adaptive immunity to a novel, highly transmissible
pathogen that poses ongoing threats to human health. Knowledge gained from these immunological studies
can inform approaches to control future emerging human coronaviruses that could become major public health
concerns. The Specific Aims of the Clinical Core are: Aim 1. Provide the clinical infrastructure and expertise for
conducting human research to improve mechanistic understanding of immunity following vaccination and
infection among different age groups. Aim 2. Define immune memory in study participants enrolled in our
COVID-19 longitudinal cohort who recover or experience Long COVID. Aim 3. Provide statistical, modeling, and

10825208,"ABSTRACT/SUMMARY:
Single-cell genomic technology has rapidly transformed modern immunology. In relatively few short years,
single-cell RNA sequencing has become near ubiquitous, primarily due to the availability of robust commercial
platforms. The ability to combine multiple forms of information simultaneously (i.e. multi-modal readouts) has
proven to be of significant utility, particularly for dissecting the diversity of the adaptive immune system. Single-
cell methodology is now capable of acquiring information on multiple modalities simultaneously: surface receptor
levels, paired immune receptor (BCR/TCR) clonotype identity, chromatin accessibility and tissue localization,
and other parameters can now be measured alongside the transcriptome in relatively routine technology. The
goal of Core B is to support the activities of Projects 1-3 by applying tailored advances in single-cell biology that
are not commercially available. In Aim 1, we will to apply single-cell DNA bar-coding technology capable of
assessing B cell specificity to SARS-CoV Spike protein epitopes from major variants. The application of this
technology, capable of resolution of epitope specific responses would address several needs in SARS-CoV-2
research: (i) it accelerates the discovery of potential broadly neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2; (ii) it
would afford comprehensive profiling of S protein variant specificity, (iii) it would provide a rich set of
immunoglobulin sequence data to measure antibody evolution in distinct epitope specificities. In Aim 2, we will
develop panels of DNA-linked antibodies to assay the protein abundance of master regulator transcription factors
associated with the innate and adaptive immune system (NEAT-Seq). The ability to profile transcription factors
provides the necessary granularity to dissect precise immune cell phenotypes and ontogeny, which will be critical
in understanding the impact of senescence of SARS-CoV-2 specific cells in Project 2. Finally, in Aim 3, we will
conduct spatial transcriptomics in support of Project 2, to profile the localization of macrophages in cadaver and
NHP tissues from SARS-CoV-2 infected and vaccinated individuals. The activities of Core B leverage prior
progress and parallel technology development by the MPIs. In the prior funding period, we developed novel
methodology to obtain paired clonotype identity and transcriptome data in antigen-specific B cells, including
development, validation and benchmarking of a novel bioinformatics algorithm capable of accurately
reconstructing paired immunoglobulin gene sequences in vaccine-elicited B cells. Here, we extend our prior work
to incorporate additional information: antigen specificity for SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. Additionally, in the prior
period, we developed and NEAT-seq technology, a method for assaying the abundance of key transcription
factors simultaneously with chromatin accessibility and the transcriptome. At the conclusion of the activities of
Core B, we will have applied novel, tailored technology to advance our understanding of variant-specific humoral
immunity, and the “in tissue” regional specialization of the innate response after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.
Collectively, these activities will enhance the insight gained from the unique samples available to this consortium."
10824346,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Discovery and development of new pharmaceuticals and therapeutic alternatives is required to
address rapid emergence of drug resistance. An attractive approach is to maximize the potential of
currently available drugs through combination therapy. However, de novo design of effective drug
cocktails has suffered from the limited understanding of their mechanisms of action or the tedious trial-
and-error methods. Moreover, drug resistance can even be aggravated by irrational and abusive usage
of noneffective drug cocktails. Therefore, a design strategy for effective cocktail recipe is needed.
Numerous observations have suggested that microbes have evolved a large collection of effective drug
cocktail recipes to fight against drug resistance after billions of years of natural selection. However,
besides a few known examples, co-produced natural products and their combinatorial potential have
been overlooked for decades. This is primarily due to the focus of the field on the biological activity of the
purified individual compounds, rather than the mixture itself. In addition, it is challenging to predict co-
produced natural products based on the genomes of the microbes that synthesize them. Moreover, the
synthesis of co-produced and synergistic natural products remains difficult. This MIRA grant will address
these challenges. The first research direction is to identify the synergies between intermediates and the
final antimicrobial natural products co-produced by single biosynthetic pathways. The structural similarity
between these compounds is expected to allow their binding towards the same targets, which can lead
to synergistic inhibition of drug-resistant microbes. By characterizing compounds biosynthesized through
the same pathways, it is expected to directly provide effective drug cocktail recipe against resistance and
to deepen the understanding of the design rules for combination therapy. The second research direction
is to address the challenge during the production of the synergistic compounds by dividing their
biosynthesis into two bacterial hosts, with one host producing the intermediate, the other producing the
final product. It is expected to have three advantages compared to the conventional biosynthesis using
a single bacterial host. First, this strategy will reduce the metabolic burden that each bacterial population
will experience, and thereby improve the overall production of the final products. Second, the titer ratio
of the synergistic intermediates and final products can be fine-tuned by manipulating only one bacterial
host, providing modularity during optimization process. Third, the system will produce the compounds
with the titer ratio showing the optimal synergistic effect, and then alleviate extensive compound isolation
and purification. Overall, the synergy of the two proposed research directions will lead to the discovery
of effective drug cocktail recipes against drug resistance, provide fundamental insights for the design
rules of combination therapy, and address challenges in the production of these compounds."

Many of the growing family of over 40 neuromuscular and neurodegenerative repeat expansion diseases,
including myotonic dystrophy (DM), involve a strong RNA gain-of- function (GOF) mechanism with toxicity

leading to the disruption of multiple downstream RNA processing pathways. The reduction of the expanded
RNAs to alleviate disease mechanism and downstream pathogenesis is therefore an attractive therapeutic
approach. We have previously demonstrated promising small molecule efficacy including: (1) actinomycin D
mediated selective reduction of transcription from expanded CTG repeats; (2) microtubule inhibitors mediated
selective modulation of toxic CUG RNA levels; and (3) diamidines mediated reduction of toxic RNAs. While
these results show promise, many of these compounds are toxic and display sub-optimal properties leading us
to develop a new set of modified polycyclic compounds (MPCs). These compounds are based on three

these elements provides a large panel of potential compounds to aid in understanding mechanism of action

two of these MPCs shows robust rescue of splicing in both DM1 and DM2 cell lines in the nanomolar range
with little associated toxicity or effects on cell viability as well as rescue of mis-splicing in 2 independent DM
mouse models. In this proposal, we will use parallel in vitro and in vivo design-model-test cycles to
systematically modify and evaluate compounds by focusing on replacement, testing and refinement of the

COVID-19 vaccine trials are now underway in pregnant women in their second or third trimester but are not expected to conclude until 2022 or 2023, and evaluation of lactation outcomes is not planned. COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective, and mounting evidence suggests immunogenic protection for breastfed infants of mothers receiving COVID-19 vaccines. To date, there are no published studies on COVID-19 vaccine safety during pregnancy or lactation for breastfed infants, milk production and excretion, or other lactation-related outcomes. This lack of safety data threatens to undermine vaccination efforts in pregnant and lactating women. Traditional data sources used for post-licensure surveillance have limited relevance for lactation outcomes . Spontaneous reporting systems suffer from reporting bias due to their voluntary nature; their lack of a denominator of vaccinated lactating women precludes risk estimates. The CDC's V-Safe program, smart phone-based monitoring for vaccine side effects, does not capture lactation status. Ongoing health care claims-based surveillance studies also do not routinely capture lactation. Observational studies enrolling COVID-vaccinated lactating women rely primarily on self-reported outcomes and have limited generalizability. To address the need for comprehensive safety data, we propose a novel study of antenatal and postpartum COVID-19 vaccination and lactation-related outcomes in mother-infant pairs, including more than 11,000 breastfeeding dyads. We will use electronic health record data linked with state immunization data across four large health systems to study infant growth, infant heath care utilization, maternal mastitis, and breastfeeding status up to 7 months after delivery following maternal COVID-19 vaccination. Also, we will explore acute infant outcomes and abnormal infant developmental screens following maternal COVID-19 vaccination. We are uniquely positioned to overcome lack of information on lactation status and reporting and volunteer bias using routinely collected information on breastfeeding at well-child visits for a defined population. We will apply rigorous epidemiologic methods, including propensity score adjustment, to address confounding. With a focus on lactation, our study will complement other studies of COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy and studies collecting milk samples from COVID-19-vaccinated volunteers. It will provide essential and currently unavailable evidence regarding lactation-related outcomes following perinatal COVID-19 vaccination. Findings supporting safety can reduce vaccine hesitancy, whereas results identifying a potential harm will be important for informing patient decision making. Furthermore, the novel approach and methods for studying lactation­ related outcomes developed through the proposed study can be adapted to efficiently evaluate the safety of drugs and vaccines currently recommended or being investigated for use in pregnant or postpartum women."
10824246,"Herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 (HSV-1, 2) are important human pathogens, producing disseminated and life- threatening neonatal infections and encephalitis, for example. They also are the most common infectious cause of corneal transplant in the USA. Genital herpes infections are a major risk factor for HIV transmission, too. Acute herpes infections resolve in a matter of days, but the virus then persists for life in a dormant, latent, state in peripheral nervous system neurons. Latent virus periodically reactivates producing recrudescence of disease. Although no vaccines are available, specific antivirals for herpes simplex virus have been clinically used since 1963. Nonetheless, the ability of these viruses to persist in latent infections, in which they express no protein that can be targeted with antivirals or immune responses, has precluded to date the development of curative therapies or effective prophylaxis. Latency is thus critical to the pathology and biology of HSV-1 and poses a major challenge to the development of curative therapeutics and effective prophylaxis. Most current models propose that epigenetic regulation plays a major role during lytic and latent herpes infection. We have recently identified a novel level of epigenetic regulation of HSV-1 transcription, regulation of transcription competency. Chromatin dynamics dictate whether HSV-1 genomes are transcriptionally competent or not, whereas the expression of individual genes is then regulated in the transcriptionally competent genomes by promoter specific factors. We will now build on those studies by testing an integrative hypothesis in which the chromatin dynamics that dictate HSV-1 transcriptional competence result from the localization of the viral genomes into nuclear domains enriched in chromatin modifiers, proteins, and posttranslational modifications that favor a highly dynamic, and transcriptionally active, chromatin. We propose that it is the destruction (or lack of assembly) of these domains in neurons what favors the silencing of the viral genomes required for latency, and their neo-formation what starts the process of reactivation. Our studies are thus centered on one of the most critical aspects of herpes simplex virus biology, pathology and epidemiology. We will use the most appropriate current technologies to address a major knowledge gap, the combined roles of epigenetics and nuclear architecture in the regulation of the establishment, maintenance and reactivation of herpes virus latency."
10824367,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Over the past decade, the importance of the extracellular matrix (ECM) composition surrounding the endothelial
cells (ECs) of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) has been increasingly recognized not only in barrier development
and maintenance, but also in dysfunction. The tight junction protein claudin-5 (CLDN5) is critical for sealing
paracellular pores between ECs to prevent the passage of fluids, solutes, and cells, thereby forming the de
facto BBB. Major gaps in knowledge include what ECM alterations occur during inflammatory injuries and how
they contribute to barrier disruption, plus how ECM-EC interactions regulate CLDN5. Our long-term goal is to
elucidate the endothelial-specific signaling pathways responsible for BBB dysfunction during inflammation.
The overall objective of this proposal is to define the role of ECM-mediated dysregulation of CLDN5-dependent
BBB function during inflammation. Emphasis is placed on a novel role for the isoform-specific function of AKT2
in maintaining maximal CLDN5 expression during homeostasis, plus a proinflammatory role of two small leucine-
rich proteoglycans (SLRPs), decorin and biglycan, in CLDN5 downregulation during neuroinflammation. The
central hypothesis is that inflammation triggers a release of endothelial-derived SLRPs which act in an autocrine
fashion to interfere with constitutive ECM-dependent regulation of CLDN5, contributing to BBB dysfunction. This
hypothesis was derived from preliminary findings generated in the applicant’s laboratory. The rationale for the
proposed research is that a better understanding of ECM pathobiology will translate into increased insights of
the pathogenic role of BBB dysfunction in a multitude of inflammation-associated diseases in the central nervous
system (CNS) which collectively account for the suffering of approximately 9 million people in the United States
alone and bear a cost burden of 300 billion dollars annually. Guided by robust preliminary data, this hypothesis
will be tested by two specific aims: 1) Determine the role of endothelial-derived SLRPs in BBB dysfunction during
inflammation; and 2) Define the role of impaired β1-ILK-AKT2 signaling in ECM-dependent BBB dysfunction.
The approach will be multifaceted, combining in vivo physiological analyses in a relevant animal model with
comparable ex vivo and in vitro experiments using primary ECs isolated from CNS tissue. Innovative
experimental models include transgenic mice with inducible BBB-specific SLRP deficiency or AKT2
overexpression; new molecular tools such as Tet-On constructs for gene transfer of decorin, biglycan, ILK,
and AKT2; targeted screening of pharmacologic agents; and state-of-the-art histopathology techniques to
detect inflammatory-mediated ECM alterations likely to only be present surrounding a small percentage of
CNS microvessels (perivenular inflammatory lesions). The proposed research is significant, as data derived
from these studies will not only establish novel concepts in ECM-dependent regulation of the endothelium but
will also provide new mechanistic insights into the pathophysiology of BBB dysfunction with the potential to
provide a basis for the development of new therapeutictargets."

While vaccines are an integral component of disease management, vaccine technologies remain inadequate for
addressing malaria. Malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum remains a global public health concern, with
more than 229 million cases and 409,000 malaria-related deaths annually. The spread of drug-resistant parasites
and insecticide-resistant mosquitoes has exacerbated the problem of controlling malaria in many developing
countries in recent years. Current control measures such as bed nets, diagnostics, and drug treatment are
helpful, however, together with more effective vaccines that reduce infection and transmission, cases of
severe malaria may be eliminated. While an RTS,S virus-like particle vaccine targeting the sporozoite stage
of P. falciparum is available, it remains only 30% protective in children that receive the vaccine, leaving children
highly vulnerable. Versatope aims to address the unmet need for an effective malaria vaccine by
leveraging their powerful, flexible, and thermostable vaccine adjuvant platform. The power of the
technology platform is based on molecular engineering of recombinant outer membrane vesicles (rOMVs)
derived from a probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 strain (BSL-1) engineered with a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and
reduced endotoxicity. The resulting rOMVs are nano-sized particles that not only display foreign antigens of
interest but also serve as potent adjuvants for long-term immunological memory and the induction of neutralizing
and effector antibodies that protect against lethal pathogen challenge. rOMVs are stable under refrigerated
conditions and can also be lyophilized and formulated for increased stability at room temperature, facilitating
worldwide deployment. Using this platform, Versatope aims to deliver a malaria vaccine that acts as both a pre-
erythrocytic and transmission blocking vaccine, protecting against both infection and transmission. The
anticipated result of this Direct to Phase II proposal is selection and advancement of a malaria vaccine candidate
that prevents liver-stage infection and reduces mosquito-borne-transmission. The success of Versatope’s
malaria vaccine would represent a breakthrough in malaria reduction worldwide as an improved pre-erythrocytic
vaccine(s) with substantially improved properties over the pre-erythrocytic RTS,S vaccine currently in use.
Specifically, Versatope’s malaria vaccine would feature improved efficacy, longevity of immunity, reduced
number of vaccinations, thermostability, and a lower cost of goods. The new pre-erythrocytic rOMV vaccine will
target 70% efficacy in preventing new infections in infants and children. Together with a 70% reduction in
infections provided by bed nets, this could reduce the R by a factor 10. The combined reduction in
transmission of malaria provided by the pre-erythrocytic vaccine and current control measures (bed nets,
access to health care, early diagnosis, and chemotherapeutic treatment) may not only allow global health
programs to eliminate malaria from low transmission areas but may provide the potential for global
eradication. This non-clinical development and toxicology program will advance the readiness of Versatope’s
malaria vaccine for clinical evaluation and implementation in malaria endemic regions."

Organophosphate (OP) pesticides poisoning is a worldwide environmental and occupational health concern
due to their neurotoxicity. Rapid and accurate detection of personal exposures to these pesticides is critical to
both research and clinical care for patients. However, their detection is still highly variable across commercial
assays and these assays are not able to adequately detect low but clinically relevant levels of biomarkers of
these exposures. Furthermore, these assays are generally performed in centralized laboratories and therefore
are costly and have a long turnaround time. These shortcomings translate into missed opportunities for timely
initiation of the most appropriate treatment and interventions for acutely or chronically poisoned patients. To
address these shortcomings, more sensitive and accurate biomonitoring tools are needed. Development of
such tools is well aligned with the mission of NIEHS. This STTR phase II project aims to further develop an
integrated nanosensor-smartphone platform for onsite rapid and sensitive detection of OP exposure with a tiny
drop of finger-stick blood. Because Phase I has soundly demonstrated the feasibility of the technology, we aim
to continue developing it through Phase II to the extent that the technology could be commercialized.
Specifically, we will: 1) < further develop a multiplex sensing platform for simultaneous and accurate
measurement of pesticide exposure biomarkers acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase from a tiny
drop of finger-stick blood and further evaluate the analytical performance of this multiplex nanosensing
platform with more OP pesticides, achieving an efficient sensing platform for onsite rapid screening /
assessment of OP exposure and poisoning; 2) further develop the current primitive mobile app to achieve
multifunctionality including multiplex sensing data processing and analyzing, results display, data storage and
management, data sharing with professionals, and education of users. > 3) carry out a comprehensive
validation of the nanosensor-smartphone platform in the field. We anticipate that accomplishing these three
aims will lead to an affordable and commercializable nanosensing platform that will be sufficiently accurate and
sensitive for rapid point-of-care biomonitoring of exposure to OP pesticides. It could be used at home, in the
field, physician’s office, bedside, and emergency room or for remote testing."

More than 6 million people in the United States are living with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related
Dementias (ADRD). Music-based interventions have been shown to decrease common ADRD
behaviors (agitation, depression) through melody and tempo to modulate parasympathetic
nerve activity, which leads to changes in heart rate, music-induced relaxation/movement, and
enhanced mood regulation. Since many music interventions are only available in institutional
settings, family caregivers often lack resources and have limited access to digital-based
applications to deliver an intervention while providing informal care for their loved ones at home.
In this proposal, we will develop, a mobile application, “Tune Den,” created specifically for the
use by people with ADRD supported by their family caregivers. Tune Den's unique design
tailored for people living with ADRD and their family caregivers is expected to have a therapeutic
benefit for the users and to reduce neuropsychiatric symptoms and change activity levels.
Therefore, the overall impact of this app could prevent or delay pharmacological interventions.
The proposed aims describe our development of app: (1) Tune Den will be created to respond to
changes in heart rate and sedentary behaviors in a wearable device based on movements of
people with ADRD. Depending on the assessment of an individual’s preferred songs and
physiological signal response to those songs, the app will learn participants’ responses and
begin to auto-play playlists, titrating the music dose based on physiological reactions. The
musical experience will be personalized to either positively stimulate or soothe and relax. (2)
We will test the usability of the app. We will recruit an advisory committee of social workers and
music therapists to test the app for two weeks. The stakeholders will report feature functionality
using the Usefulness, Satisfaction and Ease of Use questionnaire. Focus groups will be held to
expand stakeholder’s perception on the acceptability of the app. (3) We will determine the
performance and usability of the app for use by people with ADRD and their family caregivers
providing care at home. Thirty dyads will be recruited to test Tune Den for two weeks. Following
the testing period, family caregivers will complete the USE survey and rate key features like
auto play and music dose. Our study team has expertise in music therapy, aging and neuro-
rehabilitative technologies, and older adults living with dementia and family caregiving. The
successful completion of Phase I will lead to a Phase II study to determine the clinical efficacy of
Tune Den in which we will perform a rigorous trial."

Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative condition that leads to profound
declines in functional motor abilities and quality of life. It is estimated to be the most common single-gene form
of ataxia in the aging population, but it remains understudied, poorly understood, and without effective treatment
options. Elevated mRNA transcript caused by premutation expansions of the 5' untranslated region of the FMR1
gene serves as the primary molecular mechanism of FXTAS, though risk is modified by separate genetic and
molecular alterations that are not yet well defined. One reason mechanistic pathways have been difficult to
establish is that no quantitative markers of brain and behavioral changes in FXTAS are available to assess
relationships between genetic/molecular factors and neurodegenerative processes. To address this need, we
will 1) establish new biobehavioral markers sensitive to disease progression and 2) define molecular and genetic
risk mechanisms associated with quantitative brain and sensorimotor changes in FXTAS. Premutation carriers
with FXTAS (FXTAS+; n=60, including 30 females), carriers without FXTAS (FXTAS-; n=65; 30 females), and
age- and sex- matched healthy controls (n=60) will be studied at two time points separated by 24-months. Aim
1A uses measures of multiple motor behaviors (manual, postural control, gait) and task-based functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test the hypotheses that, relative to FXTAS- carriers and controls,
FXTAS+ patients show elevated motor variability associated with reduced visual cortex-cerebellar Crus I
functional connectivity. Exploratory analyses of task-free functional connectivity also are proposed. Aim 1B tests
the prediction that sensorimotor deficits and reduced visual cortex – Crus I functional connectivity during motor
behavior will become more severe over time in FXTAS, especially for males. Aim 2A uses structural and diffusion
MRI to test the hypotheses that FXTAS+ carriers show reduced cerebellar volumes and reduced microstructural
integrity of the primary input and output pathways of the cerebellum relative to FXTAS- carriers and controls.
Aim 2B tests the hypothesis that FXTAS+ carriers will show more severe changes over time in cerebellar
volumes and microstructure, especially for males. Aim 3A examines associations between FMR1 gene
alterations (repeat length, mRNA, repeat instability) and quantitative biomarkers from Aims 1-2, as well as how
associations are modified by ApoE allelic variants implicated in FXTAS. Aim 3B tests these relationships over
time. This will be the first known quantitative analyses of sensorimotor behaviors as well as the function and
structure of the primary brain locus of FXTAS, the cerebellum. By testing their change over time and their
associations with genetic/molecular causes and risk modifiers of FXTAS, these studies hold promise for
elucidating disease mechanisms and advancing urgently needed quantitative biomarkers for tracking FXTAS
onset, progression, and treatment-related changes."

Inflammatory responses organized by innate immune cells are critical to defend against infectious insult and
initiate healing responses to injury. Mechanisms that tether the strength of the inflammatory response to the
magnitude of the threat are equally important to limit unnecessarily damaging aspects of the innate immune
response. Inflammatory modes of programmed cell death such as necroptosis are a critical last line of cell
intrinsic defense to remove infected and irreparable cells while simultaneously creating and expanding an
inflammatory state in remaining healthy tissues. How inflammatory modes of death such as necroptosis create
inflammation is important to understand as it not only provides insight into the roles of necroptosis in defense
against specific pathogens, but also helps to identify therapeutic targets that can be pharmaceutically
leveraged to inhibit out of control inflammation in disease states typified by unregulated necroptotic death. We
have identified a new regulatory circuit by which the necroptotic cell death pathway is coupled to the
hyperproduction and release of inflammatory lipid mediators. The active synthesis of inflammatory lipids during
necroptotic death critically requires the activity of RIP kinase 3 and may impinge upon specific phospho-
lipases. We hypothesize that this linkage of cell death and lipid metabolism can significantly shape
inflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo. In AIM 1 we will define the mechanism by which canonical
necroptotic signals govern hyper-lipid production in primary immune cells. In AIM2 we will explore the
implications of this phenomena for necroptosis associated inflammation."

10783915,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Limitations of checkpoint inhibitor cancer treatment include precipitation of autoimmunity and resistance to
immunotherapy. For some cancers, notably prostate, lymphocytes are unable to infiltrate the cancer
microenvironment. Therefore, new approaches and targets are required. Here we present CD6, a cell surface
glycoprotein expressed by most T-lymphocytes and human natural killer (NK) cells, that engages in cell-cell
interactions by binding to its ligands CD166 (ALCAM) and CD318 (CDCP1). CD6-/- and CD318-/- mice are
healthy and are resistant to induction of T cell dependent autoimmune models of multiple sclerosis, uveitis and
rheumatoid arthritis. Moreover, in CD6-humanized mice a monoclonal anti-human CD6 antibody that we
developed, termed UMCD6, is a strikingly effective treatment for these autoimmune conditions. Both CD166
and CD318, the two ligands of CD6, are highly expressed by many cancers, and expression of CD318
correlates with aggressiveness and metastasis for many types of human cancers including prostate cancer.
CD318 can also be shed by cancer cells, and its soluble form (sCD318) is chemotactic for NK cells and T cells.
We have recently found that prostate cancer cell lines hyper-express and hyper-shed sCD318, creating a
gradient that will halt lymphocyte migration prior to entry into the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, we
tested the effect of blocking the CD6-CD318 axis with UMCD6 on the ability of human lymphocytes to kill
human prostate cancer cells. We found that UMCD6 enhanced lymphocyte-mediated prostate cancer cell
death and reduced cancer cell survival.
We hypothesize that UMCD6 acts directly on CD8+ T cells and NK cells and can produce a complete response
in vivo of human prostate cancer in immune deficient mice. We also propose that UMCD6 orchestrates
prostate cancer cell death by extensive alteration of gene expression in NK cells and CD8+ T cells, thereby
“licensing” these cells to kill cancer cells more aggressively. We will evaluate the efficacy of UMCD6 using
repeated administration of UMCD6 and human lymphocytes to treat human prostate cancers xenografted into
scid-beige mice. We will also demonstrate that high concentrations of sCD318 shed from prostate cancer can
exclude lymphocytes from entering prostate cancers in vivo, unless CD6 is internalized. To verify that the in
vivo mechanisms of the anticancer effects of UMCD6 reflect the pattern of altered gene expression in
lymphocytes in vitro, we will perform single cell RNA-seq and multicolor flow cytometry on tumor-infiltrating
lymphocytes (TILs). We will also assess the significance of upregulated stimulatory receptors by using blocking
antibodies against these receptors in cancer cell killing assays. These experiments are structured to provide a
compelling rationale for advancing CD6-targeted immunotherapy into clinical trials in human prostate cancer."

 Acute severe stress plays a pivotal role in shaping mental health, predisposing individuals to an array of
debilitating conditions, including post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety disorders. These conditions are
difficult to treat and available pharmaceuticals are of limited efficacy. There is therefore a great need to
discover novel treatments. Understanding how the brain processes the valence (i.e., magnitude) of stressful
experiences is critical for identifying new biological points of intervention. This is because the valence of
stressful events strongly influences their lasting consequences on disease-related behavior. Here, we propose
to explore the contribution of the anterior hypothalamic nucleus (AHN) – a brain region that has previously
received little attention – to the perceived valence and lasting impacts of stressful experiences."

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy is a therapeutic approach that blocks pathways that inhibit anti-tumor
immunity and activates the immune system to fight cancer. Although ICI therapy has seen significant success
in some patients, unfortunately, most eligible patients still fail to respond to treatment. Several studies have
highlighted the modulatory capacity of the microbial composition of the gut microbiome as well as certain
organisms to direct a patient’s response to ICI. Our preliminary data show that the human gut commensal
Bacteroides ovatus 8483 has the capacity to enhance ⍺-PD-L1 (Programmed Death-Ligand 1) therapy in
germ-free (GF) and antibiotic-treated mice. The lipooligosaccharide (LOS) of B. ovatus is a major cell surface
molecule comprising about 50% of the surface of this microbe’s outer membrane. The LOS exists naturally in
several different structural analogs. We have found that among the many analogs of lipid A produced by B.
ovatus, an orally delivered tetra-acylated monophosphorylated lipid A (4A-MPLA) can potently enhance the
efficacy of ⍺-PD-L1 in mice that would otherwise fail to clear tumors. We propose to determine whether 4A-
MPLA could serve as a novel therapeutic for enhancing the current cancer immunotherapy arsenal. Our long-
term goal is to use 4A-MPLA in combination with PD-1 pathway blockade to treat cancer patients, particularly
non-responders to ⍺-PD-L1 alone.
Over the course of the next two years, we aim to understand: 1) the cell types and signaling pathways by
which 4A-MPLA influences local and systemic improvement of the ⍺-PD-L1 response, and 2) understand the
types of cancers that may respond to this treatment. Given our preliminary studies demonstrating the effect of
B. ovatus on colonic regulatory T cells (Tregs), we hypothesize that B. ovatus is affecting peripheral Tregs in
the colon and disrupting their ability to restrain antitumor immunity. To test this hypothesis, we will compare the
immune profiles of cells in several tissues including the gut lamina propria, mesenteric lymph nodes, tumor
draining lymph nodes, and the tumor itself in gnotobiotic, antibiotic-treated, and specific-pathogen-free (SPF)
mice treated with 4A-MPLA compared to controls. Tregs as well as other relevant compartments of the tumor
microenvironment (TME), such as CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, NK cells, NKT cells, B cells, dendritic cells, M1 and
M2 macrophages, and monocytic and granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells, will be analyzed in mouse
tumor models for immunologic responses to ⍺-PD-L1 therapy with or without 4A-MPLA. Finally, we will
determine which murine tumor models respond to this therapy to better predict its clinical applicability."

 Astrocytes couple into networks of hundreds of cells. Impaired astrocyte coupling is associated with
epilepsy, but there is no consensus on whether reduced coupling promotes or counteracts abnormal neuronal
activity, which precedes seizures. A lack of astrocyte coupling can promote seizures;1 yet, the opposite has also
been shown: abnormal neuronal activity and seizures were reduced after coupling was inhibited1-3. An
integrated view that accounts for both findings is needed to reveal how astrocyte coupling modulates epilepsy.
In acquired epilepsy, which is initiated by a neurological insult such as traumatic brain injury (TBI), many
studies have demonstrated dysfunction of gap junctions (GJs) and dysregulation of Connexin43 (Cx43). Cx43
forms GJ responsible for astrocyte coupling leading to the conclusion that reduced coupling may contribute to
seizures. Studies in Cx43 knockout mice suggest that the timing and duration of reduced astrocyte coupling may
determine if abnormal neuronal activity is promoted or counteracted. This has not been tested due to a lack of
tools that dynamically modulate coupling. To reduce or restore astrocyte coupling dynamically, we generated
viral constructs that can be induced to express functional or mutated Cx43 for variable durations at different
stages of acquired epilepsy. These Cx43 mutants inhibited astrocyte coupling and induced neuronal
hyperexcitability in vivo. To assess the relationship between astrocyte coupling and neuronal activity, we will
use a model of acquired epilepsy that progresses to spontaneous seizures after mild TBI in the absence of many
confounding factors5. This model recapitulates three key aspects of Cx43 pathology: astrocyte coupling is
reduced, Cx43 protein is increased and increased phosphorylation at Cx43 serine 368. This post-translational
modification alters GJ conductivity, and is associated with internalization of GJ. Yet, the critical upstream
signaling causing reduced astrocyte coupling and its effects on neuronal activity during different stages of
acquired epilepsy must be revealed as a foundation for future therapeutic targeting. This proposal will generate
an integrated model of astrocyte coupling modulation in acquired epilepsy that aims to unify previous findings.
Cx43 function will be dynamically manipulated to 1) determine if the timing of reduced astrocyte coupling
modulates abnormal neuronal activity 2) identify the signaling cascade controlling reduced astrocyte coupling
and 3) determine if and when restoring astrocyte coupling prevents acquired epilepsy. Acquired epilepsy affects
65 million people worldwide and is notoriously difficult to treat. Even after decades of research and the
development of new anti-epileptic drugs targeting neurons, one third of patients still suffer from drug-resistant
epilepsy. Targeting astrocytic Cx43 might be an option, but the first step towards therapy is determining when
reduced coupling is adaptive and when it is maladaptive."
10792464,"Women carrying deleterious BRCA mutations are expected to notify their relatives about the family's inherited
cancer susceptibility. This is important because relatives have a 50% chance of harboring the same cancer-
causing genes, and may themselves be at risk for breast and other cancers. Patients sometimes collaborate with
a genetic counselor to follow this advice—disclosing their BRCA+ status to parents, adult siblings, and
additional members of their kindred. Evidence suggests women with children also want to inform their
daughters and sons about maternal BRCA+ genetic test results, but carrier mothers are often psychologically
distressed after testing and have difficulty navigating the social and medical implications for their adolescent
and young adult (AYA) offspring. It is common for these mothers to experience uncertainty over early
notification of BRCA+ to AYAs, manage their own thoughts/feelings about familial cancer, and maintain open
the lines of communication with relatives without `keeping secrets' from their own children. Although genetic
counseling assists with aspects of this decisional and psychosocial burden, there are no evidence-based
resources specifically devoted to ameliorating mothers' anxiety/depression, worry, and self-blame and traverse
complex questions surrounding BRCA+ status notification to their AYAs. In response to this gap, we developed
and successfully piloted a new, fully manualized psychosocial support and family communication decision
making protocol for BRCA+ mothers with AYA children. Our intervention is theoretically-grounded, and
deeply attends to self-management needs, hereditary cancer stresses, and age-appropriate AYA concerns.
Following standard genetic counseling, it adds 3 sessions of brief telephone counseling delivered by well-
trained peers (parent coaches) who are also BRCA+ mothers themselves. Coaching covers: a) maternal
socioemotional support, b) communication decision making training, and c) coping skill-building. We will
rigorously test for efficacy in a 2-arm RCT to determine improvements in maternal psychosocial functioning
and parent-AYA child communication outcomes after standard genetic counseling. BRCA+ mothers with AYA
daughters and sons will be recruited from cancer genetic testing centers in the greater DC and Hackensack, NJ
areas, randomized to an intervention or usual care control condition, and monitored for up to 6 months post-
treatment. Our results should provide evidence for favorably impacting this population's genetic counseling
outcomes, with a disseminable intervention poised for adoption. Peer support may be conventional within the
breast cancer community at-large, but it remains an unproven treatment ally in genetically informed oncology
care. The proliferation of genetic tests, and the modest genetic counseling workforce, necessitate new
healthcare delivery models that leverage these and other accessible resources. Targeted peer coaching with an
empirical decision support aide could prove to be a viable extension of genetic counseling efforts with BRCA+
mothers, and a complementary approach to hereditary cancer prevention and control in public health settings."

Prolonged Crohn’s disease leads to intestinal fibrosis, which is difficult to prevent or treat. The surgical
resection may negatively impact a patient’s quality of life. Thus, new therapeutic approaches are
actively sought after. We have recently shown that intestinal expression of antimicrobial peptide and
protease inhibitor elafin is reduced in stricturing CD patients. Its potential protective effect in intestinal
fibrosis has never been reported in the literature. Our preliminary data showed that elafin-
overexpression inhibited preexisting colonic fibrosis in TNBS-mediated mice, Salmonella-infected
mice, and SAMP1/YitFc mice. We generated an orally active elafin-Eudragit formulation for potential
therapeutic applications. The elafin-Eudragit formulation reversed preexisting colonic fibrosis in
TNBS-treated mice. We also discovered that elafin inhibits collagen expression in the intestinal
fibroblasts by modulating several stricture-specific genes. We hypothesize that oral administration of
modified elafin may be useful for treating colitis-associated intestinal fibrosis by affecting a stricture-
specific pathway. We propose to (1) establish oral therapeutic regimens of modified elafin for treating
intestinal fibrosis in a mouse model of preexisting intestinal fibrosis and (2) determine the cathepsin S-
PAR2-miR205-ZEB1-mediated anti-fibrogenic mechanism of elafin in intestinal fibroblasts. The overall
impact of this study will produce a comprehensive assessment of optimized oral elafin delivery

10813703,"Mental health disparities affecting sexual and gender minority (SGM) persons are well documented and
indicate a substantially greater burden of mental disorders and suicide among SGM as compared to their
heterosexual, cisgender peers across the life course. The Institutes of Medicine (IOM) identified substantial
gaps in research on these health disparities among SGM persons, particularly in the context of sustained
stigma. Additionally, as highlighted in NIH’s 2021-2025 SGM Research Office Strategic Plan, limited data
exists on SGM persons residing in rural contexts; though where data are available, they suggest higher rates
of mental disorders for SGM outside of, as opposed to residing within, urban centers. Technology-delivered
interventions addressing depression are being increasingly explored among the general population and hold
promise for use among rural SGM communities, but they must take into account both the substantial
heterogeneity of rural SGM persons and pervasive experiences of SGM-related stigma, discrimination, and
trauma to be effective. This research team from the Department of Mental Health and Key Populations
Program at Johns Hopkins University and the Programs, Research, & Innovation in Sexual Minority Health at
Emory University will use online approaches to enroll 2000 SGM (500 each cisgender female and male sexual
minorities, and 500 each transfeminine and transmasculine persons) from rural counties and small cities
across the US to follow for 12 months with repeated questionnaires to: 1) determine whether classes of
stigma, discrimination, and traumatic experiences vary across rural SGM subgroups and whether these
exposure classes are associated with increased prevalent depression and suicide ideation or attempt; 2)
determine whether these exposure classes are associated with incident depression or suicidal ideation or
attempt across rural SGM groups; and, 3) compare the relative acceptability of various technology-delivered
interventions for depression and suicide prevention tailored to address rural SGM persons’ experiences of
stigma, discrimination, and trauma. This study will produce the first comprehensive investigation of rural SGM
adults’ experiences of distal minority stressors and their relationship to prevalent mental health outcomes, as
well as by what pathways they may predict incident depression, suicidal ideation and attempts. The study will
also provide substantive evidence-based recommendations for the development or adaptation of technology-
delivered interventions to address mental health among heterogenous rural SGM communities, and in so
doing is responsive to NIH’s Notice of Special Interest on the Health of SGM Populations (NOT-MD-19-001)."
10813761,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Exposure-based therapy is an effective first-line treatment for anxiety-, obsessive-compulsive and trauma-
and stressor-related disorders. 1–6 However, many patients fail to respond or achieve remission with exposure-
based therapy, 7–11 resulting in “unnecessary” prolonged suffering, loss of productivity, and poorly used
resources. Making available a biomarker assay that can aid clinicians and patients in treatment selection has
the potential to have considerable public health impact.
Basic research on fear extinction - a core mechanism of action of exposure-based therapy - may inform
the development of a biomarker for the selection (yes/no) of exposure-based therapy. Growing evidence links

orexin system activity to deficits in fear extinction.17–20 Our group has demonstrated that reactivity to CO2
challenge, which is a safe, affordable and easy-to-implement procedure, can serve as a proxy for orexin
system activity and predicts fear extinction deficits in rodents.21
Building upon this basic research, the goal for the propo
sed study is to validate CO2 reactivity as a
biomarker of exposure-based therapy non-response.
To this end, we will assess
CO2 reactivity in
600 adults
meeting for one or more fear- or anxiety-related disorders prior to providing open, state-of-the art,
transdiagnostic exposure-based therapy. By incorporating CO2 reactivity into a multivariate model predicting
treatment non-response that also includes reactivity to hyperventilation as well as a number of related and
theoretically-relevant prognostic variables, we will establish the mechanistic specificity and the additive
predictive value of the putative biomarker. By developing models independently within two study sites and
predicting the other site's data, we will validate that the results are likely to generalize to future clinical
samples.
 The proposed study represents a necessary stage in translating basic research to strategies for treatment
selection. The investigation addresses an important public health issue by testing an accessible clinical
assessment strategy - informed by basic research - that may lead to a more effective treatment selection
(personalized medicine) for patients with anxiety- and fear-related disorders and enhance our understanding of
the mechanisms governing exposure-based therapy."
10813766,"Glutaminolysis, the cellular catabolism of glutamine, is an important metabolic pathway
for aggressive and treatment-resistant cancers, including many triple-negative breast
cancers (TNBCs). It is well accepted that glutamate produced from glutamine by
mitochondrial glutaminase (GLS) fuels the TAC cycle, which provides energy and
precursors for biosynthesis. Emerging data have revealed a less recognized but important
contribution of glutaminolysis in mediating oxidative stress introduced internally by active
growth of aggressive cancer cells and externally by treatments including chemotherapy
and immunotherapy. Targeting inhibitors of GLS to block glutaminolysis is a therapeutic
strategy that has been tested in clinical trials of breast and other cancers with acceptable
toxicity, but limited efficacy, owing in good part to a lack of clinical markers to guide patient
selection and assess target impact. Preliminary data from our lab have shown that dual
targeting of GLS and the plasma membrane glutamate transporter, xCT (SLC7A11),
resulted in dramatic sensitization of resistant TNBC to chemotherapy. We propose three
aims based upon an overall theme to develop a kinetic framework for non-metabolized
amino acid analog PET tracers to measure cellular pool sizes as an indicator of
catabolism and cellular transport. Specifically, we will (1) validate quantitative markers for
cellular glutamine pool size from dynamic [18F]fluciclovine PET; (2) develop and validate
markers for cytosolic glutamate pool size and transport using 4-(3-[18F]fluoropropyl)-L-
glutamic acid ([18F]FSPG) PET, and (3) determine the utility of combined [18F]fluciclovine
and [18F]FSPG PET for predicting and measuring response to dual-targeted treatment
designed to sensitize TNBC to chemotherapy. As part of this work, we will address
mechanistic questions regarding cytosolic glutamate transport from mitochondrial pools
and to/from extracellular fluid to guide the interpretation of PET tracer kinetics. We will
also test approaches to target TNBC metabolic vulnerabilities, specifically the
dependence glutamine metabolism and glutamate transport, guided by the PET methods
we develop and validate in our pre-clinical TNBC models. The proposed work will lead
to a deeper understanding of the mutual engagement between glutaminolysis and redox
homeostasis of cancer cells and will yield quantitative imaging methodologies ready to
translate to the clinic."
10813892,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) results in successful suppression of HIV and a decrease of AIDS
progression, people living with HIV (PLWH) experience a higher incidence of chronic diseases and shorter
expectancy of life. Chronic kidney disease (CKD), which emerged as a common complication of both HIV
infection and its treatment, has been a critical cause of shortened life span in PLWH. The pathogenesis of HIV-
related CKD is multifactorial, linked to direct exposure to HIV viremia, superinfections, the systemic immune
response to infection and ART regiments, as well as to traditional CKD risk factors. Both genetic and
environmental factors play a role in the development and progression of CKD, and affect biological functions
and pathways at multiple molecular levels. Research continues to suggest that epigenetic changes may play a
pivotal role in the pathology of CKD and HIV infection. Integrated with other molecular layers, such as host
genome and transcriptome, epigenome can mediate genetic, environmental and physiological effects, and can
potentially influence kidney function. However, the epigenomic and multi-omic impacts on kidney function and
disease have not been investigated at population level, particularly among people of African ancestry who
experience high burden of CKD but underrepresented in multi-omics research. We will identify and replicate
epigenetic predictors of kidney function using a longitudinal epigenome-wide approach (Aim 1). We will
also examine genetic factors associated with epigenetics and kidney disease to elucidate mediation,
modification and causal inference between genetics, DNAm and kidney function (Aim2). We will conduct
integrative multi-omics analyses to genes, pathways and molecular system related to eGFR (Aim 3).
Knowledge learned from this study will potentially improve long-term clinical outcomes of PLWH, promote
precision medicine for HIV treatment, and support high priority topics in HIV/AIDS research."

 2 Maternal mortality rates are three times higher among non-Hispanic Black (hereafter referred to as Black) than
 3 White women. Infant mortality rates are more than twice as high for Black than White infants. The National
 4 Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities Strategic Plan identifies interventions to address the
 5 egregious disparities in severe maternal mortality and morbidity between Black and White women as an
 6 important unmet need. This project aims to overcome these disparities by addressing the Social Determinants
 7 of Health (SDoH) impeding the health and well-being of Black pregnant women. SDoH are social, economic,
 8 and environmental conditions that have been found to mediate between racial and ethnic health disparities and
 9 these tragic maternal health outcomes. Yet no standard of care exists for how and when to screen for health-
10 related social needs in pregnancy, let alone address them. Clinicians acknowledge the risks associated with
11 SDoH in pregnancy, yet few feel equipped to address them with their patients. Moreover, Black pregnant
12 women do not trust clinicians to discuss social needs due to fear of judgment, stigma, or even loss of parental
13 rights. The product of this SBIR project is personalized and culturally competent chatbot conversations to
14 screen and address SDoH for Black pregnant women. We have developed a mobile health app to seamlessly
15 monitor and screen for maternal mood disorders for women from early pregnancy through 36 months
16 postpartum via chatbot, then refer to a behavioral health consultant when risk is detected. A preliminary study
17 demonstrated our app had a 10X higher 30-day user retention compared to an average mental health app.
18 This project will augment our existing app to also screen pregnant women for SDoH each trimester and refer
19 them to local social support services. The chatbot will follow up weekly until the need is addressed or refer to a
20 human case worker if unaddressed after a month. Integrating SDoH screening and referral into a mHealth app
21 that already screens and treats maternal mood disorders is an innovative approach to identifying and
22 addressing multiple risk factors for maternal morbidity and mortality. In this Phase I SBIR, we will demonstrate
23 the chatbot-delivered SDoH screening and referral is feasible, and it is acceptable for Black pregnant women.
24 These outcomes will inform the design and development changes needed in Phase II, before conducting a
25 randomized controlled trial to demonstrate our platform delivers useful SDoH resources and referrals and
26 reduces race-related stress. Demonstrating effective outcomes on these measures will provide us with the
27 validation needed to sell the Poisera platform to Medicaid programs, a $1.5 billion annual market size. The
28 long-term impact of this project is identifying and addressing both SDoH and maternal mood disorders among
29 the half a million Black pregnant women annually to ultimately reduce the inequitable rates of maternal
30 morbidity and mortality."
10816994,"Project Summary
 Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease in which exocrine tissue is damaged, resulting in loss
of tears and saliva. Primary SS (pSS) affects salivary and lacrimal tissue and results in many serious systemic
disease manifestations. Once diagnosis is achieved, no SS-specific curative treatment options are available; rather
treatments for SS are palliative. Thus, there is a critical need to identify etiologic events that will facilitate earlier
diagnosis of SS and development of therapeutics that mitigate the progression of this debilitating disease. Studies
in our laboratory revealed that Myeloid Differentiation Factor Primary Response Protein 88 (MyD88) is essential for
pSS development. MyD88 is an adaptor molecule that is expressed ubiquitously and is required for most Toll-like
receptor (TLR) and IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) family member signaling. Notably, TLRs and IL-1R family members are
elevated locally (in salivary tissue) and in peripheral blood cells of SS patients, suggesting these receptors contribute
to SS. Our central hypotheses are that (i) tissue-specific MyD88 expression dictates distinct pSS disease
manifestations and that (ii) activation of MyD88-dependent signaling networks drives pSS pathogenesis. Our
objectives are to identify the tissue-specific contributions of MyD88 and to determine the MyD88-mediated signaling
networks that govern pSS disease pathogenesis. We will employ a pSS mouse model (NOD.B10) and a conditional
knockout strain of NOD.B10 mice developed in our laboratory that lacks expression of MyD88 in the hematopoietic
compartment (immune cells) specifically. These mice provide a unique model system to examine the role of MyD88
in pSS directly. The rationale for this proposal rests on the fact that activation of MyD88-mediated signaling pathways
contributes to many autoimmune diseases. Both salivary tissue and immune cells express receptors that promote
inflammation via MyD88, such as TLRs and IL-1R family members. Our studies in pSS mice deficient in MyD88
demonstrate that MyD88 is crucial for pSS pathogenesis; however, the specific cell types that express MyD88 in
disease and the MyD88-dependent signaling pathways that are activated in pSS are incompletely understood. We
will test our hypotheses by completion of three specific aims: (1) Identify immune cell-specific contributions of MyD88
to pSS pathogenesis, (2) Evaluate MyD88-dependent IL-36-related cytokines in pSS, and (3) Assess the role of the
MyD88-dependent endosomal TLRs, TLR7 and TLR9, in pSS. This study is innovative because it will uncover new
mechanisms related to the role of MyD88-dependent signaling networks in pSS and will identify specific cell types
that mediate distinct pSS disease manifestations. Targeted blockade of MyD88-dependent TLR and IL-1R family
member signaling pathways represents an innovative therapeutic approach for the treatment of pSS. This proposal
is significant because it will reveal new mechanisms that govern chronic inflammation in pSS. Insights obtained from
the proposed studies will reveal novel pathways that can be targeted to treat pSS and other autoimmune diseases."
10817009,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest most commonly occurs in the pediatric intensive care unit and carries
extensive morbidity and mortality. This proposal describes a 5-year research and training program that will
allow Dr. Maya Dewan to address the prevention of pediatric cardiac arrest through clinical decision support
and implementation science. Having completed fellowship training in pediatric critical care medicine and
building on a background of improvement science, epidemiology/biostatistics, and clinical informatics the
applicant seeks to develop new knowledge and skills to use design informed clinical decision support and
implementation science to improve the care and outcomes for critically ill children.
This application seeks to address prevention of pediatric cardiac arrest. Prevention of cardiac arrest events is
feasible because children often display warning signs prior to deterioration. The applicant’s preliminary studies
demonstrate that prediction of pediatric patients at high-risk for clinical deterioration is feasible. The specific
aims of the proposed investigations are to: 1) To prospectively validate the PICU Warning Tool to predict
clinical deterioration, 2) To evaluate the impact on prediction and situational awareness of adding manual high-
risk criteria to the automated PICU Warning Tool, 3) To elucidate factors in system design that will improve
implementation of the PICU Warning Tool.
This work is significant as it focuses on the development and implementation of an effective health information
technology intervention to improve health care quality. It leverages the capability of health information
technology to improve quality, efficiency, and effectiveness of care for the highest risk pediatric patients. While
this training grant focuses on the implementation of health IT in improvement science work, it also addresses
the research areas of design, use, and impact on outcomes. Through a Type 1 effectiveness-implementation
hybrid design, Dr. Dewan will identify barriers and facilitators to implementation to facilitate a successful
translation from an academic research tool to a well implemented clinical decision support tool suitable for
routine practice."
10817011,"PROJECT ABSTRACT AND SUMMARY
 Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a devastating and incurable neurological disease
characterized by recurrent bouts of acute immune-mediated inflammation as well as insidious
neurodegeneration of the central nervous system. MRI is the most important tool to diagnose
and assess MS, allowing visualization of the hallmark pathology as T2-hyperintense
inflammatory lesions. After an acute phase, most MS lesions quickly become quiescent;
however in about 40% of patients, some remain chronically active. These “smoldering” lesions
can be identified on susceptibility-sensitive MRI by their paramagnetic rim, which has been
shown on histopathology to be composed of iron-enriched, pro-inflammatory microglia and
macrophages; these activated glial cells are hypothesized to accelerate and perpetuate the
inflammatory processes ultimately causing neurodegeneration. However, the definitive
identification and clinical consequences of these “paramagnetic rim lesions” (PRL) remains
unknown. Additionally, the possibility of treating these PRLs using contemporary disease-
modifying therapies (DMT) is an important clinical question.
 This project aims to first determine the presence of these lesions on clinically-available
3T MRI using a susceptibility-sensitive T2-star phase sequence, in a retrospective longitudinal
cohort of MS patients. The presence of PRLs will be examined for associations with other
known markers of neurodegeneration including slow lesion expansion, the appearance of new
cortical lesions, and the whole brain atrophy rate. The effects of DMT will also be assessed by
examining the details of individual treatment histories in relation to PRLs. Next, in a prospective
longitudinal cohort we aim to use an advanced MRI technique called quantitative susceptibility
mapping to determine the quantitative PRL iron concentration as a correlate of inflammatory
severity, and observe the objective rates of iron change in MS patients on different DMTs.
 The candidate plans to devote his career to the investigation of neurodegeneration and
its links to neuroinflammation. Career goals include the creation, validation, and translation of
MRI biomarkers using novel sequences. As part of this project, the candidate will be training in
the development and use of susceptibility-protocol multimodal structural MRI, as well as
learning advanced statistical modeling tools necessary to handle complex -and often
incomplete- longitudinal clinical datasets. Overall this project involves a novel translational
approach to explore hypotheses connecting smoldering inflammation to pathophysiological
manifestations of neurodegeneration that we see as clinicians caring for our patients with MS."

The overall objective of the T35 Short-Term Research In Vision & Eye health (STRIVE)
Program is to develop well qualified medical students who will ultimately become
ophthalmology clinician scientists to effectively contribute to translational eye and vision
research. The proposed program is designed to expand and diversify the pipeline of new
physician investigators in ophthalmology. The program will provide full-time support for 8-12
consecutive weeks of research and clinical training during the summer for 8 qualifying medical
students per year from across the country. We will make special efforts to recruit students from
underrepresented racial or ethnic minority groups, those with disabilities, and those from
disadvantaged backgrounds. The program builds on the exceptional training record of faculty
from the University of California San Diego School of Medicine (ranked in the top 96th percentile
for NIH Training grants) in general, and the UCSD Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology
and Shiley Eye Institute in particular. Moreover, UCSD is highly collaborative with strong
programmatic support for the translation of research from bench to bedside in areas such as
genetics/proteomics, clinical research, bioengineering, ophthalmic imaging and image analysis,
drug delivery, and biomedical informatics. The most important aspects of this program will be
hands-on research experience and development of a long-term mentoring relationship. The
multi-disciplinary research training experience will also include didactic instruction appropriate to
the area being studied, professional development seminars, lectures and journal clubs in
various disciplines. Instruction in biostatistics, research ethics, leadership, presentation skills,
and grant writing will also supplement the direct research experience. The trainees will give
poster and oral presentations at a Summer Research Symposium and will work with mentors to
develop their work for subsequent presentation at national conferences. The administrative
structure of the training program includes Co-PIs/PDs Sally Baxter, MD, MSc and Linda
Zangwill, PhD, and an Executive Committee that includes the department chair, vice chair of
education, and residency program director. In addition, an External Advisory Committee
consisting of experienced short-term training grant leaders will provide independent guidance.
There will be a rigorous and extensive evaluation of the program. Online forums, including a
website and social media outlets, will be used to facilitate continued communication between
trainees, alumni, and participating faculty."
10817013,"Summary
AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are the major excitatory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain and their dynamic
trafficking is essential for synaptic plasticity that underlies memory. AMPARs participate in vast postsynaptic
protein complexes that impact their properties and trafficking. We hypothesize that dynamic rearrangements in
postsynaptic protein-protein interactions (PPIs) tune AMPAR levels in response to stimuli, giving rise to synaptic
plasticity and memory. We previously identified GRIP1/GRIP2, PICK1 and others as key synaptic proteins that
regulate AMPAR trafficking and plasticity through dynamic and selective interactions with the cytoplasmic
domains of the receptor. Recent evidence suggests that AMPARs might also regulated by yet unidentified
interactions with their extracellular N-terminal domain. Advances in proximity-dependent biotinylation with
miniTurbo has recently enabled identification of in vivo protein interactions, occurring both extracellularly and
intracellularly, by quantitative mass spectrometry. This technology has been pioneered to map synapse
composition in vivo, but has never been used to study PPIs or synaptic plasticity in this capacity. We will extend
our characterization of AMPAR trafficking during plasticity in vivo by fusing the genetically encodable biotin
ligase, miniTurbo, to either the extracellular N- or intracellular C-termini of GluA1/2-AMPARs and deliver them
to the hippocampus of mice using viruses. We will then observe how AMPAR PPIs change in two complementary
models of plasticity – the inhibitory avoidance model of rodent memory and its direct electrophysiological
correlate, LTP of the CA3→CA1 synapse. Identification of PPIs that are common to these two models of plasticity
will not only further our model of AMPAR trafficking during plasticity but will also identify common biochemical
processes between LTP and learning and memory. Moreover, synaptic proteins that impact AMPAR trafficking
have recently been associated with various neuropsychiatric disorders such as intellectual disability, autism, and
schizophrenia and thus understanding these processes may have impact on potential therapeutic approaches
to these disorders."
10817837,"The long-term goal of this research is to reduce congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) infections by an efficacious
prenatal CMV risk-reduction intervention that reduces maternal CMV infections during pregnancy, thereby
reducing damaging congenital CMV infection. The study will evaluate the efficacy of our previously successful
brief prenatal clinic-based, theory guided CMV risk-reduction behavioral intervention to prevent maternal CMV
infections during pregnancy in young high risk women who have frequent CMV exposures and whose infants
are at increased risk of congenital CMV infections. Young pregnant women will be recruited into a CMV cognitive-
behavioral intervention trial following their first prenatal visit. After enrollment, they will be randomized to either
the CMV risk-reduction intervention or an attention-matched control stress-reduction intervention stratified by
their CMV serostatus. Women in both groups will attend an individualized behavioral skills session, watch a short
video, receive a take home packet, receive weekly text/email messages for 12 weeks that reinforce the
experimental and control interventions, and attend follow up visits at 6 and 12 weeks. Saliva, urine, vaginal, and
blood specimens will be collected at enrollment and at follow up visits. Additionally, at home saliva and vaginal
specimen collection will occur at 3 and 9 weeks, and also once during the third trimester of pregnancy. At
delivery, a saliva specimen will be collected from both the mother and infant, along with a remnant cord blood
specimen. The primary study outcomes include: reduction of primary infections in CMV seronegative women
and reduction of reinfections in CMV seroimmune women who are randomized to the CMV risk-reduction
intervention. Secondary endpoints are 1) the reduction of CMV risk behaviors and increased protective behaviors
indicated by self-report on questionnaires; 2) proportion of infants with cCMV confirmed in the first 21 days of
life; 3) CMV shedding and CMV viral load indicated by CMV DNA by PCR in saliva, urine, vaginal, or blood
specimens; 4) new CMV variants; 5) anxiety/stress levels measured by psychosocial scales; 6) measures of
adherence and acceptability of the intervention; 7) changes in CMV knowledge indicated by questionnaires; and
8) risk factors for maternal CMV infections during pregnancy (age, race/ethnicity, exposures/behaviors related
to young children, sexual activity indices). Outcomes will be assessed through pre- and post-intervention CMV
risk behaviors questionnaires in both intervention groups. Possible CMV exposures will be assessed by
questionnaires at each visit and by prenatal medical records that will be obtained for all women. CMV primary
infections, CMV reinfections, and CMV viral shedding and viral load will be assessed by IgG, IgM, and avidity
assays, serologic strain-specific assays, next generation sequencing of viral DNA, and PCR assays for women
in both intervention groups. The outcomes of this randomized controlled trial will inform prenatal health care
decisions by providing evidence that prenatal CMV risk-reduction counseling for pregnant women can reduce
maternal CMV infections, and thereby also lower the rate of cCMV infection in their offspring."
10817850,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Antibodies are highly-specific, diverse and widely-assayed biomarkers used to determine recent or historical
pathogen exposures, measure the protection conferred by a vaccine, understand the basis of autoimmune
diseases or evaluate a host's immunological function. Traditional assays for antibodies focus on one or a small
number of reactivities at a time, and so are incommensurate with the scale and diversity of an individual's
antibody response. A tool to more holistically interrogate this diversity of reactivities using a small sample volume
would enable a new generation of studies in systems immunology, disease association, and epidemiological
surveillance. Here, we propose to optimize and significantly extend an approach we have developed for highly-
multiplexed, reproducible and inexpensive assays that enable sensitive and high-resolution analysis of antibody
reactivity across 100,000s of antigens from <1µL of blood. Our approach takes advantage of a rapid, fully-in-
vitro method for generating 100,000s of DNA-barcoded peptides (`PepSeq') as probes for the highly-multiplexed
interrogation of serum antibodies using DNA sequencing. As a proof-of-concept, we will be focusing here on an
assay targeting all viruses known to infect humans (i.e., the human virome). The virome is an ideal use case for
this technology, as viruses represent an incredibly diverse and ubiquitous challenge to the immune system, and
because of their small genome sizes, the complete virome can be covered within a single library with minimal
loss of diversity. Our preliminary data with this virome assay establishes the feasibility of this approach. Here,
we will optimize the assay procedures for multiple sample types in order to increase sensitivity and specificity,
while decreasing cost. We will also establish standardized protocols for isotype-specific profiling, adapt the
technology to enable antigen-specific, single-cell characterization, and build a suite of open access data analysis
and visualization tools to facilitate the use of this technology by the broader research community. Throughout
this process, we will generate a panel of anti-virome antibody profiles, including a cohort profiled longitudinally –
this data will be made available to the community through the ImmPort portal. If successful, this project will
deliver: (i) an optimized assay SOP and library for comprehensive evaluation of pan-viral immunity using a small
sample volume, (ii) a large set of publicly-available anti-virome immunity datasets, and (iii) a framework for
multiplexed serological assay development that can be directly extended to other targets."
10818383,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) is the largest long-term study of brain development and child
health in the United States. The ABCD Research Consortium consists of 21 research sites across the country,
a Coordinating Center, and a Data Analysis and Informatics Resource Center. In its first five years, under RFA-
DA-15-015, ABCD enrolled a diverse sample of 11,878 9-10 year olds from across the consortium, and will track
their biological and behavioral development through adolescence into young adulthood.
All participants received a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging,
neuropsychological testing, bioassays, careful assessment of substance use, mental health, physical health, and
culture and environment. A similar detailed assessment recurs every 2 years. Interim in-person annual
interviews and mid-year telephone or mobile app assessments provide refined temporal resolution of
developmental changes and life events that occur over time with minimal burden to participating youth and
parents. Intensive efforts are made to keep the vast majority of participants involved with the study through
adolescence and beyond, and retention rates thus far are very high. Neuroimaging has expanded our
understanding of brain development from childhood into adulthood. Using this and other cutting-edge
technologies, ABCD can determine how different kinds of youth experiences (such as sports, school
involvement, extracurricular activities, videogames, social media, unhealthy sleep patterns, and vaping) interact
with each other and with a child's changing biology to affect brain development and social, behavioral, academic,
health, and other outcomes.
Data, securely and privately shared with the scientific community, will enable investigators to: (1) describe
individual developmental pathways in terms of neural, cognitive, emotional, and academic functioning, and
influencing factors; (2) develop national standards of healthy brain development; (3) investigate the roles and
interaction of genes and the environment on development; (4) examine how physical activity, sleep, screen time,
sports injuries (including traumatic brain injuries), and other experiences influence brain development; (5)
determine and replicate factors that influence mental health from childhood to young adulthood; (6) characterize
relationships between mental health and substance use; and (7) specify how use of substances such as
cannabis, alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine affects developmental outcomes, and how neural, cognitive, emotional,
and environmental factors influence the risk for adolescent substance use."
10818387,"Analysis of human colorectal cancer (CRC) and mouse models of CRC reveals decreased expression of
enzymes that mediate short chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolism, including ACSS2. Unlike in many other cancers,
low ACSS2 expression is associated with CRC progression, and predicts poor disease-free survival. ACSS2
generates cytosolic and nuclear acetyl CoA from acetate for de novo lipid synthesis and drives locus-specific
histone acetylation to promote gene expression. Experimentally increasing ACSS2 in human CRC cells limits
clonogenicity and growth in soft agar, consistent with ACSS2 restraining tumorigenesis.
 Colon tumors develop in a unique metabolic environment, in which gut bacteria generate high levels of
SCFAs, including acetate and butyrate. Normal colon epithelia rely on bacterial SCFAs, primarily butyrate, for
their energy needs. As with ACSS2, butyrate metabolic enzymes, including ACSM3 and ACADS, are
downregulated in CRC, and low expression correlates with poor survival. We show that increasing ACSM3
expression reduces proliferation in human CRC cell lines, and that mice with a spontaneous deletion of ACADS
are more susceptible to carcinogen induced colon adenomas. Thus, our preliminary data support a model in
which ACSS2 and butyrate metabolic enzymes limit tumorigenesis specifically in the colon.
 Our overall hypothesis is that low ACSS2 expression promotes CRC via decreased histone acetylation
and expression of its target genes, including those that encode butyrate metabolism. This facilitates a switch
from SCFA metabolism to glycolysis in the tumor. However, it also creates a cancer-specific vulnerability,
whereby CRC cells with low ACSS2 are impaired in their ability generate acetyl CoA for histone acetylation and
de novo lipid synthesis. We propose to exploit this tumor-specific vulnerability therapeutically by targeting acetyl
CoA synthesis together with nuclear processes that depend on ACSS2-mediated histone acetylation.
 Three Aims will address our overall hypothesis: 1) We will use mouse models, human CRC cell lines and
xenografts to test if ACSS2 and ACADS restrain both primary colon tumors and metastases. 2) We will test if
ACSS2 limits CRC by controlling locus-specific histone acetylation, and if ACSS2 drives butyrate metabolic gene
expression to increase butyrate use and inhibit glycolysis. 3) We will test the hypothesis that low ACSS2 levels
sensitize colon tumors to therapies targeting chromatin-templated functions that depend on ACSS2.
 This work will elucidate a novel tumor restraint function for ACSS2 in CRC, determine how ACSS2
controls metabolism, and identify new therapeutic approaches for CRC."
10818388,"Patients with heart failure (HF) account for over 1,200,000 VA outpatient visits per year, and HF remains the
most common cause for hospital admission in the VA. Approximately 1/3 of veterans with HF have `preserved'
ejection fraction (HFpEF), or relatively normal contractile function of the heart; such patients suffer functional
decline and poor quality of life, and half die within 5 years after diagnosis. Risk factors for developing HFpEF
are more common in veterans than the general population, and the burden of HFpEF to the VA system will rise
in the years ahead as these veterans age. Preventive efforts are critical, but are hampered by gaps in
knowledge related to HFpEF pathophysiology. The long term goal of this proposal is to prevent the onset of
HFpEF in at-risk veterans. Hypertension (HTN) confers the highest population-attributable risk for HFpEF,
particularly when accompanied by the metabolic syndrome, a constellation of obesity, insulin resistance, and
dyslipidemia. Animal models of HTN and metabolic syndrome develop HFpEF due to microvascular oxidative
stress and inflammation induced by high sodium intake. Recent data from cardiac biopsies confirm similar
mechanisms in human HFpEF. Dietary sodium restriction is widely recommended to prevent HTN-associated
heart disease in humans, but this advice is now controversial. Few studies have examined how individual
differences in response to sodium intake affect risk. “Salt-sensitive” persons have blood pressure (BP) that
changes in parallel with sodium intake, and commonly develop cardiovascular abnormalities associated with
HFpEF. The overall objective of this proposal is to evaluate salt-sensitivity as a novel, diet-responsive risk
factor for incident HFpEF in veterans with HTN and metabolic syndrome. The central hypothesis is that the
sodium-restricted Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH/SRD) eating pattern will improve
cardiovascular functional and structural risk factors for HFpEF in veterans with the salt-sensitive phenotype.
Guided by findings in experimental models, cohort studies, and strong preliminary evidence from our research
group, this hypothesis will be tested in a two-phase study and by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine
effects of DASH/SRD on functional and structural cardiovascular HFpEF risk factors in salt-sensitive vs. salt-
resistant veterans, 2) measure the effect of an electronically-delivered tailored-messaging intervention on
DASH/SRD adherence, and 3) determine effects of DASH/SRD intervention and adoption on microvascular
function and assess the endothelial glycocalyx as a biomarker of cardiovascular response to DASH/SRD.
Phase 1 of the study is a crossover-randomized comparison of DASH/SRD vs. control diet for two weeks each,
and Phase 2 a 6-month extension to promote DASH/SRD adherence. The salt-sensitive phenotype will be
defined by between-diet changes in 24-hour mean BP during Phase 1. In Phase 2, the efficacy of motivational
interviewing-based counseling and the Women's and Men's Hypertension Experiences and Emerging
Lifestyles Intervention (WHEELS-I), a tailored messaging program, to sustain DASH/SRD adherence, will be
compared. Echocardiography and arterial tonometry will be used to assess HFpEF-related cardiovascular
parameters during short- and longer-term dietary modification and their interaction with salt-sensitivity. In vivo
microscopy and novel blood testing will assess microvascular function and the integrity of the endothelial
glycocalyx, a blood vessel lining that is sodium-responsive and may mediate the adverse effects of salt-
sensitivity. This proposal is innovative because it represents the first study to examine salt-sensitivity as a
factor promoting HFpEF in veterans with HTN and metabolic syndrome, the highest risk group for incident
HFpEF. Moreover, it aims to link microvascular dysfunction, an important pathway in human HFpEF, with
endothelial glycocalyx damage, a potential biomarker for sodium-mediated vascular risk. The proposed
research is significant because it will vertically advance our understanding of how dietary factors contribute to
the pathophysiology of HFpEF, a major and growing health threat to veterans."

The induction of immune memory is the basis of vaccination, which arguably is the single most impactful medical
intervention in human history. Nonetheless, vaccines generally have been less effective against respiratory viral
infections. Indeed, the protection offered by currently licensed vaccines against the rapidly evolving respiratory
viral pathogens influenza and SARS-CoV-2 is limited in breadth and short-lived in duration. These shortcomings
have necessitated annual (or more frequent) booster immunizations against these viruses. There is an urgent
need to understand the unique immunological challenges faced by these vaccines to be able to enhance their
protective capacity and durability. Specifically, key knowledge gaps remain with respect to the clonal and
functional dynamics of the germinal center (GC) response over time, and how these dynamics impact the
durability, breadth, and ultimately the protective capacity of vaccine induced immune responses. In this Project,
we will utilize cohorts of vaccinated adults with unique matched samples from blood, draining lymph nodes, and
bone marrow and employ stable isotope labeling of proliferating cells to study at the cellular, molecular, and
genetic levels how GC response dynamics impact qualitative and quantitative antibody, B cell, and T cell
responses after influenza virus or SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. These innovative studies will provide new
information on human immune responses and inform design of new vaccines targeting mutable respiratory
pathogens."

According to the developmental origins of health and disease hypothesis, many disorders originate via
environmental exposures in fetal and early postnatal life. Such early life environmental exposures can alter the
developmental trajectory by disrupting the homeostasis of one or more systems, and in doing so produce
identifiable biochemical signatures characteristic of the disease process or outcome. However, the lack of a
conceptual framework as well as technological barriers have hampered research in this area; consequently,
many disorders are not detected until overt clinical signs appear in adulthood, at which point it is no longer
possible to meaningfully alter the course of development or disease. We are proposing a new paradigm that
will overcome these barriers to detect disease years before current clinical and biochemical tests. By doing so
we will be able to predict, and even prevent and treat diseases decades before any clinical signs. Central to
our proposal is an underappreciated characteristic of many human physiologic processes—they commonly
exhibit highly temporally resolved biochemical rhythms (or cycles) when at homeostasis. The idea of
biochemical rhythms in itself is not revolutionary; sleep cycles, body temperature, cortisol rhythms, and
menstrual cycles are all examples of the rhythmic nature of human physiology operating at various intervals.
Medical testing, however, seldom considers rhythmicity. We propose to develop not just a novel technology
that analyzes dynamic rhythmicity of key biochemical pathways during fetal development and childhood to
accurately detect marked and sustained deviations from homeostasis that would be prognostic of later-life
disease onset, but also a new framework for understanding development not solely as a linear trajectory but as
interconnected rhythmic processes embedded within the growth trajectory."

Tuberculosis (TB), a bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is now the leading cause
of death by a single infectious agent. One reason for this is that subpopulations of Mtb cells can survive even
lengthy chemotherapy, preventing cure of disease. These surviving cells are phenotypically tolerant, but not
genetically resistant, to antibiotic therapy. Thus, the ability of genetically identical bacteria to display different
phenotypes is a significant obstacle for the treatment of TB. A better understanding of the molecular
mechanisms underlying this phenomenon could lead to therapeutic advances for TB and other mycobacterial
infections. Much of the heterogeneity begins at mycobacterial cell division. Every time a mycobacterium
divides it produces daughters with different characteristics. We have recently discovered that this process is
genetically encoded. Deleting a single gene, which we have named lamA, leads to cells that grow and divide
more symmetrically and are more uniformly susceptible to certain antibiotics. The function of LamA and how it
mediates asymmetric growth and division are unknown. Here, we propose to investigate the molecular
function of LamA. Our published and preliminary data show that LamA localizes to the site of division, where it
inhibits the maturation of the new growth poles. In addition, we have connected LamA to the phosphorylation
state of an essential peptidoglycan synthase, and have discovered that its own localization is regulated by
phosphorylation. This leads to our hypothesis that LamA dynamically interrupts an unknown communication
relay between the multi-protein complexes that accomplish division and elongation, in a phosphorylation-
dependent manner. To test this model, we propose the following aims: (1) define the communication relay
between the division and elongation complexes; and, (2) dynamically map the regulatory events that lead to
asymmetry. Our innovation is to study a mycobacterial-specific protein that creates heterogeneity in a
genetically identical population. We will do so by leveraging our expertise in advanced imaging techniques in
combination with more traditional methods. Successful completion of these aims will lead to hypotheses about
the function of LamA that can be tested with molecular and biochemical approaches. Further, our results will
advance our understanding of the molecular basis of cell-division mediated heterogeneity, which has far-
reaching consequences for the treatment of TB. For example, identifying the molecular mechanism(s) that
leads to subpopulations of bacteria better able to survive antibiotic therapy will allow us to design drug
strategies that target heterogeneity. Such interventions could treat TB more quickly, something that would
greatly help reduce the global burden of TB disease."

Ménétrier’s disease is an uncommon acquired hypoproteinemic hypertrophic gastropathy. Patients present with
a constellation of progressive signs and symptoms that include severe abdominal pain, unremitting nausea and
vomiting, peripheral edema (due to loss of protein across the gastric mucosa) and achlorhydria (due to loss of
acid-producing parietal cells), along with an increased risk of gastric cancer. Until recently, gastrectomy has
been the only therapeutic option. The lab of my mentor (Bob Coffey) has implicated increased EGFR signaling
in the pathogenesis of Ménétrier’s disease. The EGFR ligand, transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α) is
overexpressed in the gastric mucosa of Ménétrier’s disease patients, and transgenic mice that overexpress TGF-
α in the stomach phenocopy many of the features of Ménétrier’s disease. Moreover, the EGFR neutralizing
antibody, cetuximab, is the first effective medical therapy for this disorder with all seven patients treated in a
clinical trial showed objective improvement. One patient was cured but the other six ultimately required
gastrectomy, thus improved therapies are needed. From my independent work in the Coffey lab, we have
discovered that Notch signaling is upregulated and is downstream of EGFR signaling in Ménétrier’s disease
patients and MT-TGF-α mice. Preliminary data indicates that combined blockade of Notch and EGFR signaling
is more effective in treating MT-TGF-α mice than EGFR blockade alone. To investigate the role of Notch signaling
in Ménétrier’s disease, we will utilize MT-TGF-α mice, a novel endogenous EGFR reporter line, EgfrEmeraldGFP and
the first neutralizing antibodies to mouse EGFR, P1X/P2X. Aim 1 will examine the cause of the rapid loss of
parietal cells in Ménétrier’s disease. Preliminary data suggest that EGFR signaling in chief cells increases the
Jagged1 that acts in a paracrine manner to reduce parietal cell number. Aim 2 will examine the cause of massive
foveolar hyperplasia in Ménétrier’s disease. In Aim 3, we will optimize therapeutics for Ménétrier’s disease by
combining P1X/P2X and a Notch inhibitor, the γ-secretase inhibitor, dibenzazepine (DBZ), in vivo using MT-
TGF-α mice. If we can show the therapeutic efficacy of this combination in gastric organoids derived from
Ménétrier’s disease patients, we will consider advancing to a clinical trial with an optimized regimen.
Receiving this K08 award would provide the protected time, mentorship, training and support required for
achieving my goal to be an independent physician-scientist. This research proposal is well suited for the NIDDK
as it relates to the pathogenesis and treatment of a digestive disorder. Vanderbilt provides the basic and clinical
resources needed to carry out the aims of this proposal. My mentor and co-mentor have expertise in this area
and have a proven track record of successful mentoring, and I have assembled an advisory committee with
complementary expertise. I also have delineated a career development plan to acquire the required skills to
ensure my success in establishing an independent research program by the completion of this award."
10822046,"Project Summary
 Translation is a dynamic and energetically demanding fundamental process requiring
numerous factors that promote and regulate protein synthesis. Dysregulation of translation often
occurs in many human diseases. For example, many pathogens promote their own replication by
targeting these translation factors, the ribosome, and regulatory mechanisms to undermine
translation in their host cell. One such bacterium is Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent
of the severe pneumonia called “Legionnaires’ disease”. The incidence of Legionella infections in
the United States has increased in recent years, necessitating a better understanding of how this
bacterium interacts with its host cell. Legionella translocates hundreds of toxic proteins, termed
effectors, that subvert many biochemical processes within its host. Notably, at least eleven of
these effectors inhibit translation. These effectors exert their function through a range of
mechanisms, and most appear to be enzymes that modify translation factors to inactivate them
while others mark proteins for degradation. Despite several studies describing the mechanisms
of some of these translation-inhibiting effectors, it is unclear why Legionella employs them. This
is driven by the fact that the mechanisms of some effectors remain elusive but also because their
seemingly redundant nature has made it difficult to isolate their physiological relevance.
 This proposal seeks to close the gaps in knowledge regarding the translation-inhibiting
effectors by using both specific and broad approaches. First, I will determine the mechanism of
one of these effectors, SidL. Based on strong preliminary data, I propose a set of experiments to
characterize its function and identify its molecular target. Second, I propose a comprehensive
temporal analysis of translation inhibition during the Legionella infection cycle. Legionella has a
~24-hour infection cycle and some studies suggest that the translation-inhibiting effectors are
temporally regulated; however, a careful characterization of when each effector works precludes
a deeper understanding of them. Together, these two approaches will establish a framework to
understand the physiological relevance of the translation-inhibiting effectors of Legionella.
Furthermore, because these effectors target host cell factors, this work can reveal novel insights
into our own cell biology."
10796448,"The direct cause of free sialic acid storage disorder is the genetic mutation in the lysosomal sialic acid transporter
Sialin. Although the disease has been discovered for over 20 years, no cure has been developed. The long-term
goal is to help create valuable therapeutics for patients with pathogenic Sialin mutations. The overall objective
of this proposal is to establish a basic understanding of the membrane transporter. The rationale is that, with
detailed knowledge about the structure-function relationship of Sialin, it will be possible to design small molecules
to restore the substrate translocation of dysfunctional Sialin. To accomplish the goal, three specific aims will be
pursued: 1) understand the substrate translocation mechanism of Sialin; 2) probe the connection between
defective Sialin and cardiovascular diseases; and 3) restore the transporter function of pathogenic Sialin mutants.
Specifically, in the first aim, biochemical assays, cryo-electron microscopy, and molecular dynamics simulation
will reveal the molecular mechanism. In the second aim, Sialin will be characterized in human cardiac cells and
a human induced pluripotent stem cell-based platform. In the third aim, small molecules to rescue dysfunctional
Sialin will be identified by high-throughput screening and confirmed by secondary and tertiary assays. The
research proposal is innovative because it focuses on finding a new strategy to rescue the normal function of
pathogenic Sialin mutants that are directly connected with human diseases. This proposal is significant because
it is expected to reveal the basic molecular mechanisms of Sialin and provide scientific justification for further
development of drugs against various pathogenic Sialin mutations."

Acinic Keratoses (AK) are premalignant skin lesions with the potential to develop into Cutaneous Squamous cell
Carcinoma (CSCC), which is the second most common type of cancer and when metastatic has a mortality rate
that is higher than melanoma. There is a high unmet need for topical AK medications with shorter treatment
durations and enhanced efficacy that can eradicate AK and treat the surrounding cancerized field.
The Product of this SBIR will be a Food and Drug Administration approved fixed dose combination cream
containing calcipotriol (CPO) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) as a treatment for AK in immunocompetent patients.
Technological Innovation: Topical co-administration of CPO / 5-FU eradicates AKs by activating CD4+ T cell
dominated immunity, an upstream activator of the adaptive immune response, which then recruits an array of
downstream effector cells to block CSCC development.
The Long-Term Goal is the registration of the SBIR product, which directly addresses the mission of the National
Cancer Institute by harnessing the power of the immune system to treat AKs and prevent CSCC.
Phase I SBIR Equivalent Studies demonstrated the clinical and commercial feasibility of the PHD technology
for AK treatment. Successfully completed randomized (n=130) and open label clinical studies (n=18)
demonstrated the feasibility of the CPO / 5-FU combination as the best-in-class treatment for AK and the only
product ever reported to reduce the risk of CSCC development at 3-years post treatment. The high impact of the
published data has resulted in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and the American Academy of
Dermatology recommending CPO / 5-FU as a treatment for AK. Market research demonstrated prescriber and
patient enthusiasm for the PHD product and confirmed that health insurance companies will provide broad
coverage to beneficiaries at a price that will generate meaningful revenues for the company.
Specific Aim 1. Complete a Phase 2, Randomized, Double-blind, 4-Arm, Multicenter Study to Demonstrate the
Efficacy and Safety of Topical Dosage Formulations of CPO plus 5-FU for the treatment of AK.
Phase II Objectives: Conduct a Phase 2 clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of topical dosage
formulations containing two different concentrations of CPO plus 5-FU in 160 AK patients.
Expected Outcomes: 5-FU / CPO is expected to be well-tolerated and significantly more efficacious than 5-FU
monotherapy and placebo. The data will enable dose selection and design of the Phase 3 registrational studies.
Commercial Opportunity: The target customer will be dermatologists and peak revenues of $285 mil are
projected at the lowest probable list price, with 93% of patients paying ≤ $25 out-of-pocket."

Surgical staplers are important tools in modern-day surgery to perform sutures. Surgical staplers ensure
greater efficiency, sterility, and are easier to use. They also significantly reduce the chances of infection.
Modern specimens of the surgical stapler are equipped with various functional features and ergonomic
designs for to enhance durability and minimize complications. However, there are several reports on the
adverse effects and post-surgical complications associated with these devices. Patient injuries and
manufacturing defects have led to the recall of over 3.4 million surgical staplers, staples, cartridges and
components between 2013 and 2019 by leading manufacturers. Moreover, most of these devices are single
equipment thus adding to the bulk of electronic waste. Hence, a surgical stapling device equipped with
advanced engineering technology accompanied with ergonomic design and re-usability is a clinical
requirement.
RevMedica is developing Cybernetic, an innovative surgical stapler. Cybernetic is the first semi-reusable
stapler with a tissue recognition mechanism. It allows automated firing through tactile sensor-based
automated control unit. It can provide real-time feedback to the surgeon regarding the tissue thickness and
optimal firing parameters, thus improving the performance of a surgeon, while decreasing the risks like
misfiring and other complications. Cybernetic is economical, reduces downtime between surgeries, and
substantially reduces toxic waste from healthcare facilities. Through this Small Business Innovation Research
Phase I project RevMedica’s seeks to develop a prototype of surgical stapler: Cybernetic with a tissue-
sensing mechanism and enhanced functional features and establish its efficacy and safety in benchtop and
acute animal studies. The fundamental objectives in this Phase I project will be: 1) Development of the
hardware components of the system and benchtop validation. 2) In vivo safety and efficacy testing of the
prototype in acute animal studies. The proposed activities will allow the development and preliminary
validation of the prototype. The successful implementation of the Phase I project will pave the way for further
development of additional components and chronic animal studies for Phase II. In Phase II, further pre-clinical
studies will be performed to enable FDA regulatory approval."

The gut is a major immunological organ where host-microbe interactions shape both local and systemic immune
tolerance. However, current views of intestinal immune regulation ignore fundamental differences in the function
and metabolite composition of the two distinct organs that comprise the gut—the small and large intestine (or SI
and LI). This impedes a more detailed understanding of immune regulatory mechanisms along the intestinal
tract, and limits efforts to develop safer, more targeted treatments for the two major forms of human inflammatory
bowel diseases (IBDs), ulcerative colitis and small bowel Crohn’s disease. We hypothesize that mucosal CD4 T
cells use different sets of ligand-regulated nuclear receptors (NRs) in the SI and LI to control key regulatory
functions, including IL-10 expression, to local concentration gradients of bile- and microbe-derived metabolites.
On one hand, we have discovered that Foxp3– effector (Teff) subsets in the SI—including Th1 and Th17 cells—
utilize the nuclear xenobiotic receptor, constitutive androstane receptor (CAR/Nr1i3), to direct a ‘hepatocyte-like’
transcriptional response to contend with high local bile acid (BA) concentrations, which are far greater in SI than
in LI (millimolar vs micromolar) due to ‘enterohepatic’ circulation—where primary BAs synthesized in the liver,
stored in the gallbladder, and secreted into the duodenum are actively reabsorbed by specialized enterocytes in
the ileum for portal recirculation to the liver. Because BAs are lipophilic, they can be toxic and pro-inflammatory,
and several nuclear receptors—including CAR—have evolved to suppress BA toxicity. These studies suggest
that enterohepatic circulation establishes a unique SI microenvironment that is distinct from that in the LI and
requires unique transcriptional machinery to protect T cells in the SI. Conversely, the LI harbors 103-107 times
more bacteria than SI, and ~1000-fold lower BA concentrations. Accordingly, microbes and their metabolites—
short chain fatty acids (SCFAs; e.g., butyrate), secondary BAs (produced via microbial metabolism of residual
primary BAs)—are central to immune regulation in the LI. SCFAs inhibit histone deacetylase enzymes (HDACs)
and stabilize Foxp3 gene expression in peripherally-induced T regulatory cells (iTregs), whereas secondary BAs
appear to promote regulatory functions of RORgt+ Tregs in the LI through another NR, vitamin D receptor (VDR).
Thus, while antigens from the enteric flora prime both pro- and anti-inflammatory T cell responses throughout
the gut, marked concentration gradients of bile- and bacteria-derived metabolites in the SI vs. LI are sensed by
different NRs to execute compartmentalized T cell regulatory functions. In testing this hypothesis, we will apply
cutting-edge genomics and computational approaches to comprehensively map the contributions of each of the
49 mouse NRs to specialized regulatory functions in the SI and LI in vivo, using IL-10 expression as the primary
screening target. We will also interrogate the regulation and molecular functions of two key NRs, CAR/Nr1i3 and
VDR/Nr1i1, in SI type 1 regulatory (Tr1) and LI iTreg cells, respectively. These studies will advance
understanding of lymphocyte specialization in the gut, and inform new approaches to treat IBDs."

 In the United States, several hundred thousand people experience cardiac arrest each year, with the vast
majority dying from this condition. Approximately two-thirds of cardiac arrest victims have previously suffered a
myocardial infarction (MI), and death results from maladaptive responses to infarct healing. The healed infarct
scar creates a substrate that supports malignant ventricular arrhythmias, and death results from ventricular
tachycardia (VT) originating in the border zone around the infarct scar. We recently reported that the
potassium channel beta subunits KCNE3 and KCNE4 are upregulated only in VT circuits, and that these
proteins cause a pattern of repolarization heterogeneity that supports reentrant VT. We previously developed
an epicardial gene painting method for transmural atrial gene transfer, and we have preliminary data showing
that use of epicardial gene painting with adeno-associated virus vectors allows complete transmural ventricular
gene transfer. In a successful STTR grant, we developed a prototype catheter that would allow epicardial gene
painting without opening the chest. In this fast track SBIR proposal, we exploit these findings to develop a cure
for post-infarct VT. We hypothesize that the VT circuit-specific repolarization effects create an environment
conducive for reentry VT, and that normalizing repolarization will prevent VT. To test our hypothesis, we
propose phase 1 experiments that finalize development of the gene painting catheter, verify ventricular-
targeted transgene expression with the gene painting catheter, and evaluate biodistribution and toxicity in sinus
rhythm animals. Phase 2 is a fully powered efficacy and safety study in our clinically relevant pig model of
post-infarct VT. Successful completion of these aims will create a preclinical data package required to support
future clinical testing of VT gene therapy."

common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. In addition, the liver the most common site for metastatic
cancer. Transarterial chemo- or radio-embolization (TACE/TARE) for unresectable HCC exploits the hepatic
tumors’ blood supply via the hepatic artery to selectively deliver the embolic agents and therapeutics into
targeted region of the liver. However, these treatments are largely palliative and direct visualization of the
delivery after contrast washout is not possible. Thus, new theranostic modalities are urgently needed. Alpha-
emitting radiopharmaceutical therapy (αRPT) is emerging as a highly potent treatment that effectively targets
single cells, minimal residual disease, and micrometastatic lesions to eradicate cancer cells that exhibit
resistance to conventional treatment. To address diffusion-limited penetration depths of αRPT that may result
in partial tumor irradiation, we propose to develop a dual modality imaging-visible, exosome-mediated
radiotheranostic platform for an alpha emitter delivery. In Specific Aim 1, we will evaluate the imaging visibility
and targeting ability of radiolabeled exosomes in cell monolayers and 3D vascularized spheroids. A selected
αRPT formulation will be tested in ectopic and orthotopic HCC mouse models (Aim 2), allowing us to evaluate
its biodistribution, efficacy and safety via intratumoral and intraarterial delivery. The proposed study brings a
unique combination of expertise in radiosynthesis, dosimetry, medical imaging, and animal model of cancers,
to address the critical challenges for effective HCC treatment. Successful completion of the proposed activities
will have vast ramifications for advancing the development of exosome-mediated αRPT for treating HCC or
other cancers."

The applicant, Jennifer J. Thomas, Ph.D., is the Co-Director of the Eating Disorders Clinical and Research
Program at Massachusetts General Hospital and Associate Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.
Over the last decade Dr. Thomas’s research has focused on the pathophysiology and treatment of feeding and
eating disorders, particularly the newly recognized avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID). Her
successful mentoring experience, publication record, and current funding demonstrate her commitment and
passion for patient-oriented research and provide an excellent foundation to accomplish the goals and objectives
of the proposed K24 Award. Dr. Thomas’s career development goals will enable her to (1) deepen her expertise
in multimodal neuroimaging techniques (integrating structural, functional, and diffusion MRI) to enhance her
multidisciplinary collaborations and ability to provide translational mentorship; (2) create a sustainable
infrastructure for continued research mentorship of diverse scholars to develop their own unique expertise within
ARFID that will extend beyond her laboratory and beyond the K24 period; and (3) bring together her two lines of
research (on behavioral treatment of ARFID and neurobiology of ARFID) to develop new treatments that modify
target neural mechanisms using advanced clinical trial designs. The proposed award will enable Dr. Thomas to
redistribute her effort to 30% mentorship; 60% research; and 10% patient care. Dr. Thomas will further establish
a patient-oriented research program that uses innovative multidisciplinary techniques to investigate the
neurobiology underlying avoidant and restrictive eating, and that provides an ideal environment to develop future
leaders in clinical research across disciplines. The training environment is outstanding in terms of didactic
resources and availability of techniques to assess cross-disciplinary endpoints. Importantly, Dr. Thomas has a
strong commitment from Psychology and Psychiatry leadership, and a cadre of multidisciplinary collaborators
and senior advisors, who have enthusiastically endorsed her research program, mentoring, and K24 proposal.
The specific research aims of the application are based on a recently funded R01 investigating the link between
hormones, brain function and clinical features in adults with ARFID. Important new directions under the auspices
of this award will feature multimodal neuroimaging, including assessment of brain structure (gray matter volume
and white matter connectivity) and its relationship with functional brain abnormalities and clinical features. In the
long-term, this K24 award will build capacity in the next generation of scholars to advance research in
biobehavioral mechanisms of feeding and eating disorders."

 Opioid use disorder has reached epidemic proportions in the US causing substantial mortality and morbidity.
While medication treatment for opioid use disorder (MOUD) can improve clinical outcomes, relapse rates remain
high. In addition, common medications used for MOUD such as methadone and buprenorphine have been found
to cause central sleep apnea (CSA) in as many as 30% of patients receiving treatment. Given the high
prevalence of sleep complaints in patients on MOUD and evidence that CSA causes sleep fragmentation and
intermittent hypoxemia that have been associated with adverse clinical consequences in other forms of sleep-
disordered breathing, there is an urgent need to better understand whether CSA caused by MOUD has an
adverse effect on clinical outcomes and the mechanistic pathways implicated. Preliminary data suggest CSA
may lead to sympathetic activation and nocturnal arousal which in turn exacerbate emotional distress and drug
craving that can then increase risk of drug relapse and reduce treatment retention.
 In this proposal, we will use home sleep apnea testing to identify a cohort of patients receiving MOUD therapy
with CSA and a control population without any sleep-disordered breathing, confirm CSA status with
polysomnography, and assess differences in sleep, autonomic nervous system function, nocturnal arousal,
anxiety, depression, and drug craving. We will also assess longitudinally the risk of drug lapses and treatment
retention rates over six months in the two groups. This work will establish whether CSA is associated with worse
outcomes among patients receiving MOUD therapy and the extent to which sympathetic activation and nocturnal
arousal play roles in mediating this effect. In addition, we will conduct a short-term randomized trial of
acetazolamide versus placebo in 40 patients receiving MOUD therapy with CSA to evaluate the impact of treating
CSA on improving sleep quality, restoring autonomic balance, and reducing nocturnal arousal, emotional
distress, and drug craving.
 Results from this proposal will advance understanding of the impact of CSA among patients receiving MOUD
therapy and help establish the role of sympathetic activation and nocturnal arousal in mediating the adverse
effects of this increasingly common form of sleep-disordered breathing. Our findings will advance understanding
of the potential importance of identifying and treating CSA in patients receiving MOUD as a means to improve
clinical outcomes. Our work will also help identify potential interventions to limit the adverse impact of CSA in
this population."

Radiotherapy is still one of the most effective cancer treatments used to treatment ~50 % of all human
cancers, and particularly solid tumours of the head and neck and brain. However, acute and long term
adverse side effects of radiotherapy are still common, and some tumours are also resistant to the
therapeutic effects of the radiation. The increased use of precision particle radiotherapy, particularly proton
beam therapy, enables the radiation dose to be delivered precisely to the tumour, which spares the
surrounding normal tissues of any unwanted radiation dose and is therefore able to limit some of the
adverse side effects. Furthermore, the ability to deliver radiation that causes extensive damage to the
tumour tissues (so called “high-LET”) is also a significant advantage in effective radiotherapy. However
despite this, there is still uncertainty regarding the biological effects of protons and high-LET radiation on
both normal and tumour cells and tissues, and how the radiotherapy can be optimised for patient benefit.
This proposal brings together world leading experts in radiation physics, biology and clinical oncology to
reveal new knowledge of the biological impact of protons and high-LET radiation versus conventional (x-
ray) radiotherapy, on cell models of head and neck and brain tumours. This will be performed on both 2-
dimensional, but also 3-dimensional cell models of the tumours which are more similar to those observed
in patients. We will thoroughly analyse the precise effect of protons and high-LET radiation at the molecular
(DNA) level, and how this correlates with the impact on overall survival of the cells. We will also investigate
the role of important factors such as low oxygen levels (hypoxia) which is important in driving resistance of
solid tumours of the head and neck and brain to radiotherapy, but also the rate at which the radiotherapy is
delivered (particularly high dose rates, so called “FLASH”), on the biology and survival of the tumour versus
the normal cells. Additionally, we will identify the combination of specific drugs and inhibitors under the
various conditions that are more effective in combination with protons and high-LET radiation in optimising
tumour cell killing, whilst sparing the associated normal cells.
In the long term, our research will contribute to the identification and development of more effective
strategies using radiotherapy, including proton beam therapy, for tumours of the head and neck and brain
that are particularly resistant to the radiation treatment. This will lead to an improvement in the patient
response but also in overall survival following precision particle radiotherapy.

The Southwest Transformative Educational Advancement and Mentoring (STEAM) network leverages
partnerships at the University of New Mexico (UNM), New Mexico State University (NMSU), Northern Arizona
University (NAU), and Burrell College of Osteopathic Medicine (BCOM) to strengthen the career pipeline for pre-
and post-doctoral trainees and Early Stage Investigators (ESIs) engaged in cancer and cancer health disparities
(CHD) research. As Hispanic and Minority Serving Institutions, each of these institutions is poised to make much-
needed improvements in diversifying the CHD workforce in the Southwest region in the coming years. The
STEAM network affords many reciprocal benefits to the partners based on unique resources and training
opportunities at each of the partner institutions. Training Champions (TCs) representative of the minoritized
communities in the Southwest and who have training and expertise in cancer research will serve as role models
and near-peer mentors at each institution. TCs will have central roles in helping trainees to identify paths to
achieve their training and career goals. TCs will contribute to cancer research and skill building for
underrepresented minority pre- and post-doctoral students, as well as provide vital navigation support to ESIs
pursuing careers in cancer and CHD research. TCs will: 1) provide scholars with access to a comprehensive
array of resources and technical and professional career skill building tools to promote professional development
and attainment of educational and career goals; 2) facilitate scientific community engagement by linking trainees
in a diverse, multi-site and interdisciplinary network; 3) offer culturally responsive cancer and cancer health
disparities focused curricula; 4) aid in identifying mentoring opportunities; 5) assure inter-programmatic
connectivity. Southwestern populations across New Mexico and Arizona experience high rates of poverty, health
disparities, insufficient attainment of higher education, and geographic diversity that limits access to scientific

10789950,"Cardiometabolic disorders including obesity, insulin resistance, related dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes (T2DM)
are highly prevalent among U.S. Veterans and serve as major factors in the development of heart, vascular and
liver diseases. We have assembled a multi-disciplinary research team from multiple VA and academic medical
centers with expertise in cardiovascular and metabolic disease, clinical and epidemiological research, EHR
based research methods, genetic epidemiology, and statistical genetics, to participate in the Million Veteran
Program (MVP) through the Beta-test award entitled “Genetics of Cardiometabolic Diseases in the VA
Population”. In addition, we have helped establish a highly synergistic network of trait- and methodology-based
Working Groups that have facilitated collaborative projects among several funded Beta-test teams. Since first
gaining access to MVP genetic and phenotypic data in GenISIS less than 18 months ago, we have contributed
substantially to or led studies that have confirmed and/or identified >500 susceptibility loci for body mass index,
height, prediabetes, T2D, dyslipidemia, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), coronary artery disease
(CAD), and peripheral artery disease (PAD). We have disseminated our findings to the scientific community
through >20 presentations at national meetings and have submitted or are preparing to submit multiple
manuscripts related to these initial efforts. For the current renewal application, we propose to continue this line
of investigation with particular focus in leveraging longitudinal information related to time course of disease. In
Aim 1, we will build on our momentum of our initial genome wide association studies (GWAS) of prevalent
disease and single time point measures of quantitative traits by expanding our efforts to examine the genetic
basis of the longitudinal progression of cardiometabolic traits including increasing BMI; pre-diabetes to type 2
diabetes, manifestation of micro- and macro-vascular complications in T2D, NAFLD to liver cirrhosis and cancer,
pre-clinical conditions to CHD, PAD, and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) disease. In Aim 2, we will explore
the pleiotropic relationships between multiple cardiometabolic traits as well as with non-cardiometabolic traits in
the MVP and the UK Biobank. Moreover, we will conduct participant-level Mendelian Randomization studies to
more robustly document causal links between highly correlated pairs of traits identified through our pleiotropy
analyses. Finally, in Aim 3, we will assess the discriminatory power of derived polygenic risk scores for
cardiometabolic diseases in the VA population, with specific emphasis upon evaluating their value in different
minority populations. Our overarching hypothesis is that elucidating the genetic underpinnings of cardiometabolic
conditions and their interactions with environmental and/or lifestyle factors will provide a more precise
understanding of disease progression over time, thereby informing more targeted genomic medicine-based
disease management throughout the course of Veterans' lives."
10792468,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Emotion dysregulation (ED) increases risk for psychiatric and behavioral problems, and leads to polypharmacy,
crisis interventions, and high rates of suicidality. Rates of clinically elevated ED are particularly high among
those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Effective treatment of ED could greatly reduce morbidity and costs
and significantly improve quality of life for individuals with ASD. Unfortunately, the development of evidence-
based interventions for ED in ASD has been limited by the absence of measures that assess ED without being
biased by differences in intellectual and verbal ability. The Emotion Dysregulation Inventory (EDI)
(R01HD079512) was developed to address this obstacle. The EDI is a caregiver report that measures rapidly
escalating, intense, and poorly regulated negative emotion and dysphoria. It was validated on 1755 school-
aged verbal and nonverbal ASD youth as well as a sample of 1000 youth representative of the general US
population. The EDI is already being used in multiple clinical trials and for screening and treatment monitoring
in inpatient and outpatient settings across the U.S. and in 10 other countries. This project will build on the EDI's
conceptual and psychometric strengths and apply Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information
System (PROMIS®) methods to develop the EDI-Young Child (EDI-YC for ages 2-5) and the EDI Self-Report
(EDI-SR for ages 12+). Samples of 800 participants with ASD, 200 with other intellectual and developmental
disorders (IDD), and 1000 from the general community will be recruited to complete calibration and
psychometric analysis of each measure using Item Response Theory (IRT) and traditional psychometric
analyses. The change-sensitivity of the EDI-YC and EDI-SR will be evaluated in the context of funded clinical
trials. The availability of the EDI-YC will motivate ED prevention and intervention in early childhood during this
critical period of early brain plasticity. The EDI-SR will be developed through a systematic item refinement
process to ensure validity even in the context of cognitive impairments or poor emotional awareness, thereby
creating new opportunities to incorporate patient perspectives and include the often overlooked but growing
population of adults with ASD or IDD in clinical trials when no caregiver is available. Finally, the translational
value of this research will be supported by linking specific neural features of ED (e.g., hypo-activation of the
lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) during frustration and cognitive inflexibility tasks) to ED in ASD as assessed by
the EDI. This will be accomplished through neuroimaging via collection of functional near-infrared spectroscopy
(fNIRS) and EDI data in a sample of 125 4- to 17-year-olds with ASD. Because of ED's transdiagnostic
significance, the impact will span outcomes from aggression to suicide and other critical symptoms related to
ED. We will ensure the EDI battery's utility across populations by evaluating the candidate EDI-EC and EDI-SR
items in non-ASD IDD samples, as well as through the generation of general norms from large community
samples."
10792472,"PROJECT SUMMARY –
 This R01 proposal addresses a critical need in the advancing field of combination therapies involving potent
alpha particle emitters. Radium-223 dichloride is an alpha particle emitting bone-seeking radionuclide range. In
patients with bone metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (bmCRPC), which has a very poor prognosis,
this therapy has achieved improved overall survival with a well-tolerated safety profile. There is great interest in
further improving these treatment gains through combination with other therapies. However, there is a lack of
basic science data to support which combinations may provide a significant benefit nor for which patients. This
deficit has been brought into stark relief following unexpected negative outcomes in two combination trials. The
need for a better understanding of how to combine alpha particle emitters with other therapies is significant
beyond Radium-223 alone, as its approval has helped to generate considerable interest for other alpha particle
emitting agents, many of which are entering clinical evaluation at this time.
 Here, we undertake multiple, independent investigations of means to improve drug delivery to disease sites,
spare off-target tissues, and to more deeply understand the basis for positive and negative outcomes of
combinations. This proposal is predicated on extensive preclinical investigation and emergent clinical findings
and are tested in technically advanced models of disease that recapitulate key features of human bmCRPC. In
Specific Aim 1 (S.A.1) we test the long term safety profile and anti-metastatic efficacy of combining 223Ra with
an approved pharmacological modulator that improves drug delivery to the bone and reduces off-target uptake.
S.A.2 extends our compelling pilot data into the molecular basis for the lethal combination of abiraterone acetate
and 223Ra; the clinical evaluation of this combination was halted due to increased fracture and risk of death. In
S.A.3 we investigate the impact of DNA repair defects on Radium-223 responses in controlled systems following
intriguing findings in a limited patient cohort with improved responses to 223Ra.
 The impact of our findings will be immediate; our pilot data indicate molecular mechanisms to avoid toxicity,
to predict those most likely to benefit from 223Ra, as well as identify combinations that may produce severe side
effects. Long-term, these data and tools have considerable import in motivating improved management of the
tens of thousands of patients with bone metastatic disease. The skills and knowledge of a multidisciplinary team
of experts in the fields of nuclear medicine, radiation oncology, radiochemistry, preclinical disease models and
pathology ensures the highest likelihood of achieving the proposed aims."
10792594,"Metabolic Biomarkers of Response of Mantle Cell Lymphoma to Bruton Tyrosine Kinase Inhibition
Project Summary/Abstract
Due to increased application of kinase inhibitors to cancer therapy, there is a need to develop noninvasive ear-
ly detection methods to monitor the activity of treatment in patients. We aim to develop methods to address
three critical issues – 1) early detection of tumor response or resistance to therapy, particularly by noninvasive
imaging techniques, 2) defining detailed mechanisms of drug response and resistance, and 3) using this infor-
mation to overcome drug resistance. Noninvasive in vivo monitoring of cell signaling pathways is not feasible,
and monitoring of changes in tumor volume is a late and often misleading response indicator. FDG PET, while
ideal for tumor detection is not response predictive, likely because it evaluates only the first two steps of the
glycolytic pathway, while tumors are able to use other pathways to process nutrients required for their growth.
We propose a novel alternative – to detect response by monitoring the key metabolic pathways regulated by
the kinase inhibitor. Our basic premise is that changes in tumor metabolism are earlier and more reliable indi-
cators of therapeutic response than changes in tumor volume. We focus on the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK)
signaling pathway using an FDA-approved BTK inhibitor, ibrutinib (IBR), as well as two second-generation in-
hibitors of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). We propose to use a comprehensive genomic/phospho-
proteomic/metabolomic approach to delineate the mechanism of response and resistance to BTK inhibition. In
preliminary studies we have evaluated index MCL cell lines, one of which (MCL-RL) is highly sensitive to IBR
and another (JeKo-1) is resistant. Preliminary RNA-Seq analysis indicates that BTK modulates expression of
many genes involved in key metabolic pathways including glycolysis, the pentose shunt, TCA cycle and glu-
taminolysis. By measuring metabolic flux through these pathways before and after treatment with IBR, we will
determine which of these pathways are critical to response and resistance. We found that in JeKo-1 cells glu-
taminolysis is critical to IBR resistance and can be overcome with glutaminase inhibitors. We have developed
and validated novel 13C MRS and 13C LC-MS methods to monitor flux through key pathways of tumor metabo-
lism and propose to use these methods on the MCL models in in vitro and in vivo studies to define the mecha-
nism of response and resistance to the drug. Lactic acid, alanine and choline have emerged as potential meta-
bolic biomarkers of response of MCL cells to BTK inhibition that can be monitored by 1H MRS using the Had-
Sel-MQC pulse sequence developed by us. In Aim 1, we will perform genomic and metabolomic studies of re-
sponse and resistance to BTK inhibition in cell lines and primary cells derived from MCL patients. In Aim 2, we
will utilize in vitro 1H MRS and 13C MRS and LC-MS to verify and quantitate perturbations of metabolic fluxes in
pathways identified in Aim 1 as potential imaging biomarkers of BTK inhibition. Finally, in Aim 3 we will utilize
1H, 13C & 31P MRS imaging and LC-MS analysis in mouse xenografts of MCL to validate the metabolic bi-
omarkers of BTK inhibition identified in Aims 1 & 2."

10808594,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Cannabis is commonly co-used by individuals who drink alcohol, such that their intoxicating effects overlap
(known as `simultaneous use'). Simultaneous use is known to be associated with experiencing increased
negative consequences, however, evidence is conflicting regarding whether cannabis acutely increases or
decreases alcohol consumption. The neural mechanism(s) underlying simultaneous use are also not well
understood. Existing research suggests that overlapping neural mechanisms underlie the effects of alcohol and
THC (Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, the primary psychoactive substance in cannabis), and this circuitry may affect
motivation for alcohol misuse and simultaneous use. Specifically, cannabinoid receptors (i.e., CB1, to which
THC binds as a partial agonist) are distributed throughout the mesolimbic brain regions that underlie alcohol
reward. Activation of CB1 is thought to influence neural circuitry underlying reward signaling, such that reward
signaling may be amplified by THC, however it is unclear whether THC sates or primes reward-responses to
alcohol. An important limitation of prior work is that most studies have used THC doses that are significantly
below the level used in the real world. Legal-market cannabis products containing high levels of THC are
increasingly popular and available, but their effects neural reward processing and acute alcohol self-
administration have not been studied in the laboratory. We propose to test the effects of a 20mg oral dose of
THC (i.e., a dronabinol capsule) vs 0 mg THC (placebo capsule) on reward processing during alcohol and
cannabis cue-reactivity tasks in 25 adults who drink alcohol and use cannabis. Participants will complete a
baseline session and 2 experimental laboratory sessions in this double-blind pharmaco-imaging study with a
crossover design. At one experimental session, participants will consume THC before undergoing a brain scan
and participating in an intravenous (IV) alcohol self-administration session. At the other experimental session,
they will undergo the exact same study procedures after consuming the placebo capsule. Session order will be
counterbalanced. We will also examine if neural responses to THC are associated with real-world co-use
patterns as assessed by two weeks of daily-diary data collection. The pharmacokinetics of oral THC provide a
long time period of elevated blood THC levels, allowing us to perform an MRI scan and IV-alcohol session
while THC remains at peak blood levels. We hypothesize that individuals who experience stronger neural
reward signaling or reduction in aversive signaling following 20mg dronabinol vs placebo will self-administer
more IV alcohol and report more frequent simultaneous alcohol and cannabis use during the daily diary period.
Aims include examining the effect of oral THC on neural response to reward (i.e., alcohol and cannabis cues),
examining the effect of oral THC on alcohol self-administration, and examining the relationship between neural
reward responses and alcohol consumption."
10808792,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The objectives of this K08 proposal are to foster the development of critical scientific and professional skills that
will allow the candidate, Dr. Mona Alotaibi, to advance toward her goal of becoming an independent investigator;
and to investigate the role of metabolic dysregulations and bioactive molecular markers of endothelial
dysfunction in modulating pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) progression in human studies and experimental
models. This will be achieved through a comprehensive training plan and extensive laboratory experience and
course work, which will provide Dr. Alotaibi additional expertise in experimental design, laboratory procedures,
large data handling and laboratory leadership skills. Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a rare but life-threatening
condition, that if left untreated leads to right ventricular failure and death. Despite advances in therapeutics, PAH
mortality and morbidity remains unacceptably high, motivating efforts to identify circulating biomarkers and
mechanistic targets that could improve tailored treatment approaches and outcomes. Central to PAH
pathobiology is endothelial dysfunction governed by imbalance between endothelial derived relaxing and
contracting factors. These factors include circulating small bioactive lipid mediators, eicosanoids known to exhibit
vasoactive properties including vasocontraction or vasodilation in context dependent matter. Sensitive methods
for comprehensively detecting and quantifying distinct eicosanoid species have been limited with prior studies in
PAH focusing mainly on cyclooxygenase pathway. We have shown that distinct lipoxygenase (LOX)-eicosanoid
dysregulations exist in animal models with severe pulmonary hypertension and these metabolites associated
with mortality and worse clinical outcomes in human. The overall goal of this proposal is to utilize our newly
developed mass spectrometry approaches together with comprehensive, complementary study design that
include human biosamples, PH murine models and cell culture experiments to provide an unprecedented view
into the role and mechanism of LOX-eicosanoid derangements in PAH. We hypothesize that endothelial LOX
intermediates play an important role in the development and progression of PAH through sustained pulmonary
vasoconstriction and concentric pulmonary vascular remodeling, and particularly via activation of mechano-
sensitive and receptor-operated cation channels in both pulmonary arterial smooth muscle and endothelial cells.
We will test this hypothesis in three Specific Aims: 1) To determine the relation of LOX-derived eicosanoids with
PAH disease progression and outcomes; 2) To examine whether LOX-HETEs induce spontaneous PAH or
enhance PH in animal models; 3) To examine whether LOX-HETEs activate or upregulate mechanosensitive, or
receptor operated cation channels in pulmonary arterial vasculature. Successful implementation of these Specific
Aims will provide a rigorous training program for Dr. Alotaibi, laying the groundwork for R01 submission, and will
allow us to answer a fundamentally important question about the role of LOX-eicosanoids as specific biomarkers
for disease risk and target for future interventions."
10928265,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Up to 80% of patients with cirrhosis experience pain—a rate that is twice as high as in the general population.
Yet managing pain in cirrhosis patients is uniquely challenging due to provider concerns about adverse events
related to multiple classes of analgesics, which unfortunately puts these patients at risk for undertreatment of
pain. There are limited data on actual pain management strategies and analgesic-related harms in the clinically
diverse population of cirrhosis patients, and consequently, minimal evidence-based guidance on how to
appropriately treat pain in this population. The objective of the current proposal is to address this critical unmet
need by investigating real-world utilization and harms of commonly used analgesics among patients with
cirrhosis to inform the development of evidence-based guidance to support providers in managing pain in this
population. With KL2 support, Dr. Rubin has created a retrospective longitudinal cohort of >500,000 Veterans
with cirrhosis using national Veterans Health Administration (VHA) electronic health record (EHR) data. She
will leverage this cohort to achieve the following Aims: (1) Define the epidemiology of pain management, and
rates of and risk factors for analgesic-related adverse outcomes in cirrhosis; (2) Quantify the risk of major
adverse outcomes in analgesic users versus nonusers; (3) Establish guiding principles for providing evidence-
based pain management to cirrhosis patients through a Delphi consensus process. This work will provide
essential preliminary data for a future pragmatic trial to test the impact of dissemination of this guidance on both
provider practices and patient outcomes and quality-of-life. Dr. Rubin is uniquely positioned to conduct this study
as a hepatologist the at the University of California, San Francisco with experience studying clinical outcomes,
including pain and analgesic use, in cirrhosis patients using large datasets. Building upon a strong foundation
of research support, this K23 award will establish Dr. Rubin as an independent health services researcher by
providing her with formal training and experience in four essential skills for generating and translating real-
world evidence: (1) effectively leveraging large EHR-based datasets, (2) pharmacoepidemiologic analysis, (2)
causal inference methods, and (4) techniques for translating evidence into clinical practice. She has
assembled a multidisciplinary mentorship team with expertise in hepatology and clinical outcomes research
(Jennifer Lai), biostatistical and epidemiologic skills for leveraging observational data (Salomeh Keyhani), and
pain management and pre-implementation/implementation methods (Karen Seal). Her scientific advisors will
provide additional methodologic expertise in advanced biostatistical methods (Charles McCulloch), VHA-based
epidemiologic study design (Katherine Hoggatt), and Delphi consensus methods (Rebecca Sudore). The
proposed multidisciplinary team, scientific aims, and career development goals will not only foster Dr. Rubin's
transition to a successful independent investigator and health services research leader within the field of
hepatology, but also, more importantly, improve the care delivered to cirrhosis patients suffering from pain."

By combining a firm understanding of the design and conduct of rigorous human studies with the growing
toolkit of the molecular biologist and geneticist, modern patient-oriented physician-scientists have the potential
to overcome age-old barriers to the development of targeted therapies in common and morbid respiratory
diseases. Accordingly, the first goal of this K24 Mentoring grant renewal application is to continue to protect my
time for mentoring of young research scientists in patient oriented translational research in asthma and COPD.
This work is a natural extension of work undertaken in the first funding period and builds on the success of my
mentees and in further increases in NIH grant support of my research programs. These mentoring efforts have
been strongly supported by UCSF through the provision of space to start and expand a “Pulmonary Precision
Medicine Core Laboratory” that I direct and which provides scalable space and resources and a common area
for didactics and informal research interactions for mentees in patient oriented research (POR). This K24 grant
has significantly protected my time and provided resources (some matched by Divisional resources) to ensure
the success of this endeavor. In a new direction that I have recently been inspired to pursue, the second goal
of this K24 renewal is to support my mentoring efforts in the study of racial disparities in how we assess and
treat obstructive lung disease. This new research area flows directly from new data that I and two mentees
generated in SPIROMICS, the longitudinal cohort that I direct. These data highlight systematic bias that results
from race-adjusted pulmonary function testing equations that are used in research and clinical care. In its
structure, this K24 renewal application proposes three scientific aims and a fourth organizational aim which
describes my approach to expanding the core training laboratory and seminar series that I have developed by
leveraging larger new space that is being conferred to me by the Pulmonary Division and Department of
Medicine at UCSF based on the success of these programs to date. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that airway
epithelial endoplasmic reticulum stress identifies a common pathway related to both T2 and interferon-driven
inflammation and which is associated with increased disease severity and exacerbation risk in asthma and
COPD. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that maintenance of cilia and detoxifying pathways in the airway
epithelium of smokers is associated with clinical resilience in smokers. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that our
current practices for lung function normalization are fundamentally biased and that race-agnostic PFT
equations better measure health and disease in our diverse society. Aim 4 will test the hypothesis that the
“Pulmonary Precision Medicine Core Laboratory” that I have developed will enhance multidisciplinary training
across a range of trainees with diverse scientific backgrounds and enable them to expand their capabilities well
beyond their existing core training, while focusing on human studies and POR."
10810731,"Psychostimulant abuse is a public health crisis that affects millions of individuals in the United States and
results in profound economic, social, and individual harm. However, despite rapid increases in overdose
deaths linked to stimulant drugs like cocaine, there are still no approved therapeutic options for stimulant
abuse disorders. Psychostimulant drugs act through well-defined signaling mechanisms to elevate
dopaminergic neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key reward-linked brain structure that
integrates information from diverse brain regions to directly influence motivated behavior. Further, cocaine
causes epigenetic and transcriptional reorganization in medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the NAc, promoting
maladaptive shifts in cell signaling and synaptic function. Our preliminary data indicates that expression of
Gadd45b (Growth, arrest, and DNA-damage inducible protein 45b) mRNA is upregulated in the MSNs after
both cocaine and dopamine receptor stimulation, and that Gadd45b is required for cocaine-related memory
formation. However, although Gadd45b plays a critical role in epigenetic reprogramming and memory
formation in other brain regions, the role of Gadd45b in cocaine-related epigenetic, molecular, and behavioral
adaptations is not clear. In this proposal, we will test the overarching hypothesis that Gadd45b regulates drug-
induced behavioral plasticity by control of activity-dependent DNA demethylation in the NAc. Specific Aim 1 of
this proposal will combine bidirectional CRISPR-based manipulations and single-nucleus RNA sequencing to
determine how Gadd45b signaling impacts transcriptional responses to cocaine. Specific Aim 2 will use novel
Gadd45b tools and genome-wide DNA methylation profiling to identify the molecular interactions that regulate
Gadd45b-dependent epigenetic programming in the NAc. Finally, Specific Aim 3 will use cell-specific in vivo
Gadd45b manipulations in combination with behavioral assays of cocaine and natural reward to test the
hypothesis that Gadd45b enhances the behavioral effects of cocaine. Together, these experiments will identify
Gadd45b target genes in the NAc, dissect epigenetic mechanisms by which Gadd45b contributes to cocaine’s
epigenetic effects, and define a role for Gadd45b in cocaine-related behavioral plasticity. These studies will
reveal fundamental mechanisms by which Gadd45b contributes to psychostimulant response, and will pave the
way for future experiments to explore how drugs of abuse engage the epigenome to alter motivated behavior."

The objective of this multicenter study is to develop and validate a novel, non-invasive biomarker for pediatric
NAFLD. The specific aims are to recruit a cohort of 80 youth (6-21 years of age) with NAFLD and 80 controls
with obesity and study their skin surface lipids using state of the art lipidomic analyses to: 1. Determine the
cutaneous lipids that differentiate youth with NAFLD from controls; 2. Investigate the skin lipidome that detects
the presence of advanced disease (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [NASH], fibrosis) among those with NAFLD;
and, 3. Further support the use of skin surface lipids as a biomarker of NAFLD in children by studying its
repeatability and variability. Participants will undergo magnetic resonance imaging with proton density fat fraction
(MRI-PDFF) at baseline to determine the presence/absence of NAFLD. This methodology has been shown to
be accurate in determining the presence of hepatic steatosis. They will then have their cutaneous lipidome
sampled using tape stripping. The latter is a rapid (<5 min), painless procedure that samples the lipids of the
most superficial layer of the skin (from the stratum corneum and the lipids secreted by the sebaceous glands).
All patients with NAFLD will have had prior histologic confirmation of their disease, which will be re-reviewed and
scored by a single pathologist, with expertise in pediatric NAFLD, who will be masked to patient clinical and
demographic characteristics. Untargeted lipidomic analyses of the collected skin samples will be performed using
ultra high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry to determine the skin
surface lipids that alone or in combination predict the presence of NAFLD. The performance of the cutaneous
lipidome in predicting the presence of NAFLD in youth with obesity will be compared against that of the currently
used screening test, namely serum alanine aminotransferase levels. Among those with NAFLD, the performance
of skin surface lipids in predicting the presence of NASH and fibrosis will be assessed. Lastly, a subset of patients
with NAFLD will have repeat skin sampling: a. on the same day from the opposite arm, to test the repeatability
of cutaneous lipidome, and b. 1 month later, to test the variability of the lipidome as a biomarker. Variables that
may affect the skin surface lipids, such as sex, age/pubertal status, change in diet, obesity severity and insulin
resistance status, will be assessed and controlled for in these analyses. A non-invasive biomarker for pediatric
NAFLD is urgently needed, due to the staggering prevalence of this disease and the fact that the currently
available invasive diagnostic modalities (liver biopsy) are not practical and hinder therapeutic discovery and
progression."

Early developmentally-based behavioral intervention has well-established positive effects and is recommended
as the standard of care to support early brain maturation, health, and development. However, few neonatal
intensive care units (NICUs) provide this early intervention. H-HOPE (Hospital to Home: Optimizing the
Preterm Infant’s Environment) has established efficacy, and has a standardized protocol, making it ready for
widespread implementation. The infant-directed component of H-HOPE provides Auditory (voice), Tactile
(moderate touch massage), Visual (eye to eye), and Vestibular (rocking) stimulation starting when infants are
ready for social interaction. The parent-directed component of H-HOPE includes participatory guidance and
support to help parents engage with their infants in the NICU and the transition to home. In our NIH-funded
research, H-HOPE improved growth, developmental maturity and mother-infant interaction, and reduced initial
hospitalization costs and acute care visits through 6-weeks corrected age. This research tests whether H-
HOPE can be implemented and sustained in five diverse NICUs, using a Type 3 Hybrid design to evaluate
both implementation processes and effectiveness. The specific aims are to: 1) Identify the degree of
implementation success; 2) Evaluate the effectiveness of H-HOPE for infants, hospital costs from H-HOPE
enrollment until discharge, and parents, compared to a pre-implementation comparison cohort; and 3)
Determine influences (facilitators and barriers) associated with implementation success and H-HOPE
effectiveness, guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). An incomplete
stepped-wedge design guides staggered roll-out for five clinical sites. Each NICU completes the CFIR
implementation steps (Planning and Engaging, Executing, and Reflecting and Evaluating), followed by 6
months of Sustaining. For Aim 1, degree of implementation success is determined every two months as
Sustainability (still offering H-HOPE), Reach (% of eligible parent/infant dyads receiving H-HOPE) and Degree
of Implementation (mean H-HOPE services received per parent-infant unit) (primary implementation
outcomes). For Aim 2, effectiveness is analyzed using generalized linear mixed models for infant, cost, and
parent outcomes (primary outcomes: infant growth at discharge and acute care visits from discharge to 6-
weeks corrected age). Propensity score analysis is used to make the pre- and post-implementation
comparable. For Aim 3, we use mixed methods analyses to identify influences from H-HOPE records and
interviews that are associated with implementation success and effectiveness at each site and across sites.
This is the first time implementation in a NICU is guided by the evidence-based CFIR framework, and results
will make a major contribution to implementation science. This study will produce an evidence-based
implementation strategy and Toolkit to disseminate nationwide. Widespread H-HOPE implementation will make
a significant change in clinical practice and improve preterm infant health and health care costs."

Despite the advances in antiretroviral therapy (ART) and its widespread use, cognitive impairment is commonly
seen in HIV-1-infected patients. A salient feature of the HIV-1 infection is the initiation and maintenance of
chronic inflammation which underlies a number of co-morbidities. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders
(HAND) represent a most common comorbidity in HIV patients and involves a spectrum of cognitive, motor,
and/or neurological issues. Substances of abuse, such as cocaine, aggravate the CNS pathogenesis even in
patients receiving ART, with neuroinflammation playing the central role in this comorbidity. Given the
widespread occurrence of substance abuse in HIV patients, therapies that specifically target
neuroinflammation in this patient population remains an urgent and unmet challenge. Nucleotide binding
domain of the leucine rich repeat pyrin domain containing protein-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome has emerged as a
druggable target for the management of HIV-1-associated neuropathologies, but optimal drug candidates have
not been designed yet. The NLRP3 inflammasome is shown to be activated in response to a wide array of
pathogen- and danger-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs respectively). Activation of the
NLRP3 inflammasome in turn, stimulates the activity of caspase-1 and results in the release of pro-
inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18, ultimately causing neuronal pyroptosis and
death. Disruption of NLRP3 signaling was reported to display beneficial effects in the transgenic mouse models
of neuroinflammation. Our recent studies identified a small molecule, AMS-17, that thwarted the NLRP3
activation in N9 microglia both in vitro and in vivo. AMS-17 was well-tolerated by the microglial cells and did not
adversely affect microglial viability. This proposal is focused on developing computationally-guided structural
changes in AMS-17 to improve its biological activity and maintain low toxicity. Aim 1 described in this proposal
is focused on the computer-assisted design, synthesis and chemical characterization of AMS-17 analogues.
Aim 2 will involve in vitro and in vivo screening of the novel analogues developed in Aim 1. The in vivo studies
will be performed in HIV-infected humanized mice treated with cocaine, thus modeling the disease in people.
The proposed studies are highly significant since they will provide new therapeutic options to minimize HIV-
associated neurocognitive dysfunction in substance abuse. The proposal incorporates expertise in the area of
synthetic medicinal chemistry (Dr. Kulkarni), computational chemistry (Dr. Hevener) and biological screening
(Dr. Bukrinsky). Additionally, Dr. Mocchetti will provide his expertise in the area of animal models of cocaine in
HIV. The proposal builds on our previous research and is fully consistent with the goals of this RFA."

disparity can be partially explained by sex-related biological differences and women's longer life expectancy.
The remaining portion is ascribed to structural inequalities. Building on prior research, I hypothesize that
women's unequal access to employment has contributed to their cognitive disadvantage by restricting their
ability to cognitive enrichment through the life course and other valuable employment-related resources. The
proposed Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) will give me protected time and resources to
undertake additional training in social determinants of ADRD, implementing quasi-experimental analytic
methods using life course data, and survey cognitive health assessment. I will also bolster my understanding of
the physiological underpinnings of ADRD to be able to pursue an interdisciplinary research agenda. Supported
by a team of highly accomplished mentors in neuroscience, psychology, gerontology, epidemiology, and
population health, I will carry out innovative and rigorous quasi-experimental studies that approach the
question of women's labor force disadvantage implications for cognitive disparities from a life course
perspective. First, I will use the Irish TILDA cohort to examine the effects of married women's labor force
exclusion on their cognitive outcomes later in life. Second, I will use UK's ELSA data to study the effects of the
introduction of paid and protected maternity leave on British women's cognitive outcomes later in life. Finally, I
will use American HRS data to evaluate the impact of women's earlier retirement on their cognitive outcomes
later in life. The datasets selected combine high-quality social, cognitive, and health data and rich life course
histories. The skills and expertise I will gain will put me in a strong position to make major contributions to our
understanding of structural determinants of disparities in cognitive health, become an independent NIH-funded
researcher, and lay the foundation of my new research program in employment, policy, and cognitive
disparities."

NEXMIF is an X-linked gene with little known biological functions. Deletion of NEXMIF in humans results in encephalopathy demonstrating delayed brain development, impairments in communication and memory, intellectual disability and seizures. In females, heterozygous expression of NEXMIF due to X chromosome inactivation results in a unique pattern of NEXMIF expression in the brain, leading to complex patterns of neural connections. In this grant, we propose to utilize female mice to determine the features of mosaic expression of NEXMIF in the brain within various brain regions. We plan to cross the NEXMIF heterozygous mouse with wildtype mouse line that contains X-linked GFP, which will allow for easy visualization of the NEXMIF identities of neurons for analysis. We aim to elucidate the cellular and molecular dysregulations in the haploinsufficient female mouse brain, including neuronal morphology, synaptic protein expression, and input-specific alterations in synaptic transmission between the WT and KO neurons. Further, we find that neurons in the female transgenic brain are affected in a non-cell-autonomous manner; thus, we will examine the mechanisms by which the WT neurons are regulated by the KO cells in the mosaic neuronal population. Findings from this study will provide important original knowledge on the neurobiological function of NEXMIF, which will help with the development of strategies for clinical intervention in NEXMIF-related disorders."

It is a Fast-Track R43/R44 application containing both Phase I and Phase II. We have already demonstrated
the feasibility of a SATB2 inhibitor (patented molecule), which is effective in vitro and in vivo. In US,
hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) incidence has tripled over the past two decades and is expected to become
the third leading cause of cancer deaths by 2030. African Americans (AA) have been shown to exhibit a higher
incidence of HCC and experience lower survival compared with Caucasian Americans (CA). The disease has
disproportionately affected minority and disadvantaged populations. Health disparities arise from the
conditions in which people are born, grow, live, and work. There is increasing recognition that adverse
environment and unfavorable living conditions, economic status, stress, and genetic factors affect an
individual’s health through oncogenic pathways leading to HCC development. Unfortunately, these
factors/pathways are involved in the initiation and progression of HCC and therefore are responsible for racial
disparities in HCC incidence and mortality. Special AT-rich binding protein 2 (SATB2) is a nuclear matrix
protein that acts as a key regulator of gene expression and chromatin remodeling. SATB2 modulates the
expression of genes, which regulates pluripotency and self-renewal of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Higher
expression of SATB2 in HCC from AA, compared to CA patients, was positively associated with greater cell
growth and metastasis. This suggests that SATB2 expression or function can be exploited for eliminating HCC
racial disparities in AA. There are no FDA-approved small organic molecule-based SATB2 inhibitors in the
market. The goal of this project is to develop chemotherapy in which the newly discovered SATB2 inhibitor
inhibits higher HCC growth in AA, compared to CA, using clinically relevant cancer cell lines, and patient-
derived tumor (PDX) model established from HCC tissues derived from AA and CA patients, resulting in
eliminating HCC disparities in AA. We hypothesize that differential expression of SATB2 in HCC tissues of AA
determines more aggressive phenotypes than those in CA, and SATB2 inhibitor suppresses higher HCC tumor
growth in AA compared to CA, resulting in eliminating HCC disparities in AA. Aim 1. To use artificial
intelligence (AI) techniques to identify potent SATB2 inhibitors (Phase I). Aim 2. To examine the biological
effects of SATB2 inhibitors using HCC samples isolated from AA and CA patients in vitro (Phase I). Aim 3. To
examine the maximum tolerable dose and toxicity of the SATB2 inhibitor in mice (Phase II). Aim 4. To examine
whether SATB2 inhibitor suppresses higher growth of HCC tumors from AA than those from CA, resulting in
the elimination of racial disparities (Phase II). Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques will be performed to identify
non-toxic and drug-like selective SATB2 inhibitors. Binding residues of SATB2 which interact with SATB2
inhibitor (small organic molecule) will also be identified. Orthotopic (with well-characterized cell lines and
CSCs) and patient-derived tumor (PDX) mice models established from AA and CA will be used to examine the
anti-tumor activities of SATB2 inhibitor. Tumor growth, molecular changes in tumor tissues, and maximum
tolerable dose, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics of SATB2 inhibitor will be examined. In conclusion, the results
of our study will discover new SATB2 inhibitors and novel therapeutic strategies to reduce HCC mortality and
eliminate health disparities in underserved populations."

Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) is the largest long-term study of brain development and child
health in the United States. The ABCD Research Consortium consists of 21 research sites across the country,
a Coordinating Center, and a Data Analysis and Informatics Resource Center. In its first five years, under
RFA-DA-15-015, ABCD enrolled a diverse sample of 11,878 9-10 year olds from across the consortium, and
will track their biological and behavioral development through adolescence into young adulthood.
All participants received a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging,
neuropsychological testing, bioassays, careful assessment of substance use, mental health, physical health,
and culture and environment. A similar detailed assessment recurs every 2 years. Interim in-person annual
interviews and mid-year telephone or mobile app assessments provide refined temporal resolution of
developmental changes and life events that occur over time with minimal burden to participating youth and
parents. Intensive efforts are made to keep the vast majority of participants involved with the study through
adolescence and beyond, and retention rates thus far are very high. Neuroimaging has expanded our
understanding of brain development from childhood into adulthood. Using this and other cutting-edge
technologies, ABCD can determine how different kinds of youth experiences (such as sports, school
involvement, extracurricular activities, videogames, social media, unhealthy sleep patterns, and vaping)
interact with each other and with a child's changing biology to affect brain development and social, behavioral,
academic, health, and other outcomes.
Data, securely and privately shared with the scientific community, will enable investigators to: (1) describe
individual developmental pathways in terms of neural, cognitive, emotional, and academic functioning, and
influencing factors; (2) develop national standards of healthy brain development; (3) investigate the roles and
interaction of genes and the environment on development; (4) examine how physical activity, sleep, screen
time, sports injuries (including traumatic brain injuries), and other experiences influence brain development; (5)
determine and replicate factors that influence mental health from childhood to young adulthood; (6)
characterize relationships between mental health and substance use; and (7) specify how use of substances
such as cannabis, alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine affects developmental outcomes, and how neural, cognitive,
emotional, and environmental factors influence the risk for adolescent substance use."
10817060,"PROJECT SUMMARY
People with severe mental illness (SMI) face double the risk for type 2 diabetes compared to the general
population, contributing to higher rates of cardiovascular disease and premature death. Common use of
antipsychotic medications contributes to these health risks due to prevalent metabolic side effects. Many
younger adults with SMI do not receive targeted, evidence-based cardiometabolic disease prevention care.
Underused strategies include: prescribing alternative, less obesogenic psychotropic medications; lifestyle
change supports; additional risk-reducing medications; and smoking cessation therapies. Our preliminary
qualitative data with patients and clinicians identified a need for tools to match prevention care to individuals’
risk level and preferences, and tools suited to population-based care strategies. Clinical Decision Support
(CDS) tools are computer algorithms that use patients’ data, predictive analytics, and clinical guidelines to
promote evidence-based care by helping patients and clinicians navigate complex treatment decisions.
Through this mentored K23 career development award, Esti Iturralde, PhD will build upon her background as a
clinical psychologist and behavioral diabetes researcher. Through planned mentoring, coursework, and career
development activities, Dr. Iturralde will gain a strong understanding of psychopharmacology and
cardiometabolic health, advanced predictive analytics, and implementation science, including methods for
stakeholder-engaged intervention design and pragmatic clinical trials. As a researcher in the Kaiser
Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Division of Research (DOR), she will leverage robust, longitudinal
electronic health record (EHR) data (> 50,000 adults from diverse racial/ethnic groups) and stakeholder
insights (patients, clinicians, and health system decision-makers) within health systems including KPNC and 2
others belonging to the NIMH-funded Mental Health Research Network (HealthPartners Institute and Henry
Ford Health System). The proposed research will support the training goals while contributing to the
development of a novel CDS tool seeking to increase targeted, evidence-based diabetes and cardiovascular
disease prevention care for adults under age 45 who are starting antipsychotic medications. Specific research
aims are to: (1) inform predictive analytics of the CDS tool by developing and validating diabetes risk prediction
models for the target population; (2) engage stakeholders in the design of CDS tool messaging and
implementation pathways; and field-test CDS tool messaging through a pragmatic clinical trial conducted within
an existing KPNC telehealth-based population management program serving this population. A future R01
application will build on the results from this project to further refine and test the CDS tool within multiple health
systems. The linked research and training aims will directly prepare Dr. Iturralde for success as an embedded
health system researcher and prepare her to lead a programmatic line of studies developing and implementing
data-driven, feasible, scalable interventions improving the cardiometabolic health of people with SMI."
10817061,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This mixed-methods informatics study employs a series of data science methods triangulating data from
Interviews and EHR documentation, with the goal to identify essential documentation from the
COVID-19 pandemic and reduce EHR burden. EHR burden for registered nurses has been demonstrated by
increased documentation time, documentation amount, workload, and burnout and linkages to poor patient
outcomes. Decreasing EHR burden is a national priority, yet, there is no clear evidence to differentiate which
types of documentation are essential to support patient care. In recognizing the increased workload demands
during the COVID-19 pandemic, New York issued orders that relaxed documentation requirements for
clinicians, including nurses. Therefore, nurses’ documentation during the pandemic in New York reflects the
information deemed most essential by nurses – providing a unique and rare natural experiment to study
documentation burden. On the contrary, Missouri ranked as the 18th highest state for COVID cases overall,
and had no similar state orders. To advance the science, we will learn about nurses’ documentation from a
data science and informatics perspective, discover which documentation patterns (i.e., types, amount of data
entry and viewing) are deemed essential by nurses, and examine documentation pattern changes overtime
from before the pandemic through present day. We know that EHR burden exists, yet it is not understood
which documentation patterns explain and influence the relationship between patient care activities and patient
outcomes. We will use an EHR log-file time-based measure of patient care activities, operationalized as “total
shift time” minus “time spent documenting patient care activities or viewing data”. We will target respiratory
care management for acute and critical care patients and also include delirium care management for critical
care patients - applicable outcomes for both hospitalized COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. The specific
aims are to: Aim 1: Examine changes in the temporal trends of data entry and data viewing patterns of nursing
documentation (e.g., types, amount) from 2019 through present day, inclusive of the COVID-19 pandemic
timeline. Aim 2:
Investigate how nurses define and decide what is essential to document for patient care
and the impact of all-inclusive documentation (i.e.,
documentation that meets both clinical and regulatory
demands)
on EHR burden
. Aim 3: Examine changes in data entry and data viewing patterns of nursing
documentation and the impact of these changes on patient care activities and patient outcomes, while
controlling for confounding factors related to workload, and nurse, patient, team, and organizational
characteristics."
10817073,"A promising strategy to overcome the limited survival of dental restorations lies is the addition of healing
microcapsules in the organic matrix of the restorative materials. These capsules, when reached by the crack,
are broken and release the healing agent, inhibiting its propagation. However, there are several critical gaps
and crucial improvements to make this approach suitable and commercially viable. Our long-term goals are
to introduce optimized healing agents, minimize the side effects of addition of the capsules, via shell wall
functionalization, and validate advanced method for encapsulation. Previous studies revealed that low
viscosity amides are capable of modulating the polymerization reaction, and more tough and degradationresistant than methacrylates, so these compounds are going to be used as alternative healing agents. In
addition, thiourethane surface functionalization has been shown to be an efficient method to increase fracture
toughness and reduce polymerization stress, so we propose to functionalize the capsule surface with this
compound -the methods for functionalization were developed in my post-doctoral mentor's laboratory, which
increases the chance of success. Finally, we aim at overcoming the main issues involved in the doubleemulsion method, such as poor size control of the capsules and high sensitivity of the method, by utilizing
the green chemistry coaxial electrohydrodynamic atomization (CEHDA) technique for the encapsulation
process. In summary, the following Specific Aims are proposed to: (1) Introduce amides as healing agents,
(2) Functionalize the microcapsule's surface with thiourethane oligomers, and (3) Improve encapsulation
process with advanced technology. The K99 mentored phase has been focused on tailoring and optimizing
the microcapsules synthesis in order to encapsulate properly compounds with different hydrophilicities and
minimize the healing agent leakage. The second main goal of this phase was to enhance the double torsion
fracture toughness technique to assess the healing efficiency and the kinetics of the crack propagation under
a more clinically relevant scenario. Collected data has highlighted that the incorporation of the microcapsules
into the thermosetting polymeric networks changes dramatically the kinetics of the crack formation and
propagation. Therefore, in the independent phase of this proposal, the crack growth kinetics and the polymer
healing will be closely monitored by the incorporation of fluorescent dyes into the encapsulated healing
agents, the investigation of the magnitude of the effects promoted by the addition of the microcapsules in
systems containing the unreacted compound triethylene glycol dibutanoate, and the use of digital image
correlation (DIC) technology. The central hypothesis is that the tough healing agent, shell wall
functionalization, and introduction of CEHDA method to produce capsules will significantly increase the
potential and viability of self-healing dental materials. This proposal will broadly impact the field by modifying
and improving essential self-healing components and developing an alternative method for encapsulation
process, making this approach a tangible resource for resin composites survival."

New therapeutics are desperately needed for the treatment of diseases with unmet needs, such as emerging
infections and immunological diseases. Specialized metabolites (natural products) produced in nature have
historically played a critical role in drug discovery, however high rates of rediscovery have resulted in a significant
drop in drug candidates. The long-term goal of this proposed research program is to use an ecology-based
discovery platform to investigate complex ecosystems, specifically the microbiota of marine egg masses, where
evolutionary pressures exist to evolve specialized metabolites that can be leveraged as anti-infective and
immunomodulating therapeutics.
The success natural products have had in the clinic is due to their evolutionary history, their structures and
functions evolved over millions of years of selective pressures to carry out an essential role for the producing
organism. For example, many of the antibiotics used in the clinic today are produced by terrestrial
microorganisms that use them to vanquish competitors. The microbiomes of marine egg masses provide an
intriguing source of potential drug candidates as it has been hypothesized that evolutionary pressure has led to
the development of defensive metabolites and these defensive metabolites can be repurposed for the treatment
of infections in humans. Our first long term goal is to establish the egg mass microbiota as a host of diverse
bacterial symbionts and then using these symbionts to build a natural product fraction library. This fraction library
has been screened in a variety of biological assays, with an initial focus on anti-infective and immunomodulating
assays, and the natural products components of each fraction are being profiled with innovative metabolomics
techniques, nuclear magnetic resonance-based MADByTE and mass spectrometry-based GNPS. Active
components will be elucidated, their biosynthetic gene clusters identified, and evaluated in an in vivo rodent
model. Our second goal is to leverage the ability of the isolated microbes to produce novel metabolites as studies
have revealed that only a fraction (< 25%) of the metabolites are produced under typical laboratory conditions.
Using a community-based co-culturing technique and innovative techniques that utilize collected egg masses
will allow us to replicate many of the chemical interactions that occur in the ecological environment, which are
known play an important role in the regulation of these silent metabolites.
Collectively, our proposed research program will broadly impact the field by establishing marine egg masses as
a good source of novel natural products. Studying the small molecules produced by these bacterial symbionts
will lead to the discovery of novel anti-infective agents and has the potential to repopulate the drug pipeline
targeting unmet and increasingly frequent diseases."

Advances in molecular biology and genetic engineering have led to the design and use of modified T cells
recognize tumors to achieve significant tumor control upon adoptive cell transfer (ACT) to patients. These T cells
are either transduced with tumor antigen reactive T cell receptors (TCR), or chimeric antigen receptors (CARs).
Recently, a surge in studies with neo-antigen reactive T cells or T cells recognizing novel mutated antigens has
also shown promise. While the implementation of these studies requires significant technical resources, the
appearance of antigen loss variants also leads to less effective tumor control when using effector T cells reactive
to single tumor antigen or target molecule. Thus, there is a resurgence in using tumor infiltrating lymphocytes
(TILs), which have endogenous T cells reactive to multiple tumor epitopes, for ACT. While most studies have
used the conventional approach to expand TILs using high dose IL2, some recent studies using IL15 or IL21
showed improved tumor control. Preclinical studies have also shown that different subsets of both helper CD4+
T helper (Th) cells and CD8+ T cytotoxic (Tc) cells hold promise for clinical use in ACT protocols. Importantly, T
helper cell subsets with the ability to secrete IL-17 (Th17) have been shown to possess stem cell like phenotype
that attributes to their long-term persistence and leads to improved tumor control tumors as compared to the Th1
subsets (that secrete IFNγ, IL2, TNFα). However, contrary to these observations there are reports that Tc1 cells
exhibit improved tumor control as compared to Tc17 cells. These differences in T cell subsets response to control
tumors, is compounded by the fact that in the suppressive tumor microenvironment a large fraction of these Th
or Tc subsets acquire FoxP3+ regulatory phenotype, become dysfunctional or undergo cell death leading to
tumor reversion. Thus, ex vivo programming conditions that can render a stable phenotype with reduced
‘plasticity’ and not only controls primary tumors, but also results in formation of anti-tumor memory will be of
immense importance in ACT. We have recently established that programming conditions that bring together
‘anti-tumor effector function’ of Th1 cells and ‘stemness’ of Th17 cells lead to a superior hybrid Th1/17 (and
Tc/17) cell exhibiting long-term tumor control. Thus, in the Phase I application we successfully tested the
feasibility of programming metabolically enhanced signature to TILs from melanoma and prostate cancer
patients. For the Phase II application, we hypothesize that ex vivo programming and expansion using hybrid
T1/17 (Th1/17 and Tc1/17) culture conditions will result in a robust anti-tumor control even with fewer adoptively
transferred clinical grade metabolically enhanced TILs (meTILs). Following specific aims are proposed to
establish and develop our approach for commercialization: Specific Aim 1: To generate clinical-grade hybrid
meTILs from melanoma and prostate cancer patients. Specific Aim 2: To establish if clinical grade hybrid meTILs
are superior to conventional TILs in controlling tumor growth in vivo. We believe that this proposal will help adopt
the novel ex vivo programming conditions for generating hybrid meTILs that could be used future in adoptive T-
cell immunotherapy clinical trials."

Combining live imaging with single-cell sequencing is a powerful approach for gaining comprehensive
understanding of individual cell behaviors within complex biological systems. However, existing
approaches are limited in throughput, rely on computational data alignments that are prone to bias, or
require analysis of isolated cells. The goal of this Fast-Track SBIR application is to develop a novel cellular
barcoding technology that will enable researchers to conduct both standard live-cell imaging and high-
throughput single-cell sequencing, and then align the two sets of data unambiguously according to the cell
barcodes. The proposed approach uses dual-barcoded laser particles (LPs) with unique pairs of optical
emission spectra and oligonucleotide sequences. These barcodes can be identified either optically during
imaging or by single-cell sequencing. Built on promising preliminary data, Phase I of this project aims to
demonstrate the feasibility of dual-barcoded LPs on a small scale. Upon success of Phase I, Phase II will
streamline and scale up the fabrication of the LPs and test and validate the technology towards
commercialization. The optical barcode readout requires a high-resolution spectrometer and a pump laser.
In Phase II, add-on hardware modules and cell-tracking software will be developed and tested to be
compatible with existing commercial microscopes, making it easier for researchers to adopt the technology.
Additionally, Phase II research aims to demonstrate the usefulness of imaging-sequencing data via a pilot
study of cancer cells. Furthermore, potential risks and solutions for the technology will be explored,
including the long-term effects of LPs on cell gene expression patterns. Overall, the outcome of this Fast-
Track project will be significant technological advancements to the field of single-cell analysis for both basic
research and drug discovery."

 The goal of the proposal presented herein is to produce naturally occurring 6-deoxysugars, including di-
and tri-deoxysugars, amino sugars and branched-chain sugars. These specialized hexoses are found as
important structural components throughout plant and microbial secondary metabolites, often playing a crucial
role in conferring activity in bioactive natural products, such as antibiotics and anticancer therapeutics. They are
of increasing interest in glycoengineering efforts, which aim to alter sugar substituents found on glycosylated
natural products or append sugar moieties to non-glycosylated natural products.
 In nature, 6-deoxysugars are frequently built up and modified as part of activated dTDP-nucleoside
sugars instead of independent molecules. We propose to investigate a novel approach to produce these rare
deoxysugars using a proprietary E. coli system we first developed to produce activated TDP-deoxysugars. To
do this, there were several challenges to address in the Phase I Feasibility study. First, titers of the TDP-
deoxysugars needed to be increased, preferentially accumulating more material in the growth medium. Second,
an effective way to separate and purify the molecules from the growth medium needed to be developed. Finally,
the deoxysugars needed to be hydrolyzed and isolated.
 In Phase I we demonstrated the feasibility of deoxysugar production using D-fucose derived from dTDP-
D-fucose as a model. This was accomplished by 1) Increasing production of dTDP-D-fucose by enhancing
expression and solubility of Fcf1, the enzyme used to make dTDP-D-fucose from TKDG, 2) determining a
medium capable of producing larger quantities of dTDP-D-fucose in the medium, 3) developing a dTDP-D-fucose
purification protocol from the medium, 4) developing a method for hydrolysis of dTDP-D-fucose and the
subsequent purification of D-fucose.
 In Phase II, we will expand the process to manufacture 18 additional deoxysugars from dTDP-
deoxysugars. Further optimization of the dTDP-deoxysugar production pathways will be conducted to increase
the amount in the medium to 0.5-1.0 g/L. This will allow us to produce up to a 2.5 g of each deoxysugar from a
single 10 L fermenter. In Phase III, we will commercialize the deoxysugars, individually and as a kit, to
researchers in academia and industry. Through expanded production, the work done in Phase II will also help
increase production of the dTDP-activated deoxysugars as important secondary products."

Alzheimer Disease (AD) is characterized by b-amyloid (Ab) accumulation, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs),
neuroinflammation, and widespread neuronal and synaptic loss. To date, there are no therapies available,
although immunotherapies i.e., Lecanemab hold promise. Species differences underlie the difficulties in
translating therapeutics uncovered in animal models for human brain-specific diseases, e.g., AD and AD-related
dementia (ADRD). Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technological advances enable better human-
specific disease modeling, particularly when disease-related genetic mutations are absent in murine or rodent
models (e.g., many AD GWAS genes), but face challenges due to the difficulty in mimicking the in vivo context
in current in vitro models. Microphysiological systems (MPS) with defined cellular compositions can provide
scalable, reproducible brain models that better recapitulate the in vivo environment, in which preclinical drug
discovery efforts can translate to a higher success rate for identified targets and compounds. This project
proposes the development of a mini-brain assembled organoids (assembloids) NanoLuciferase-based platform
using AD patient-derived APOE4 and isogenic gene-edited APOE3 iPSCs to facilitate effective and reproducible
screening for AD therapeutics. NeuCyte employs robust differentiation protocols to generate neurons, astrocytes,
and microglia in large quantities facilitating the generation of NeuroImmune Assembloids (NIA) in which the 3D
microenvironment recapitulates salient ex vivo brain phenotypes, e.g., neurodegenerative and cell-type specific
phenotypes due to a genetic mutation, enabling improved translatable high-throughput preclinical drug discovery.
While isogenic, this platform is also modular, i.e., NLuc is inserted in different contexts i.e., reporter lines in
different cell types facilitating mechanistic cell type-specific assays mimicking the cellular complexity of the
human brain. The AD/ADRD MPS NLuc platform incorporates bioluminescence-based AD neuropathological in
vitro assays to facilitate high-throughput drug screening. Successful completion of Phase I will establish the
feasibility for commercialization of an AD/ADRD NLuc drug screening platform."
10820961,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Heterozygous germline missense mutations in replication-independent (RI) histones are emerging as the
cause of histonopathies, a devastating class of pediatric neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). However, the
neurobiological function of histones in human pathology and, more broadly, in development is understudied. In
part, this is due to the high degree of homology shared by the ~100 histone encoding-genes, which has
historically rendered them refractory to genetic sequencing. This proposed work builds on our innovative histone
variation intolerance prediction project that we pursued to overcome traditional histone-specific limitations. In my
2022 publication of this work, we more than doubled the list of RI-histonopathy disease genes from 3 to 8. We
have since built unpublished cohorts of patients for 4 of the 5 novel disease genes, including an unrelated cohort
who share a pathogenic de novo heterozygous germline missense mutation in MACROH2A1 (c.80G>A,
p.R27Q). Our patients’ phenotypes exhibit substantial overlap with those of patients harboring heterozygous
missense mutations in other RI histones, suggesting a shared pathogenic mechanism. We hypothesize that this
MACROH2A1 de novo heterozygous germline missense mutation causes an NDD through a gain-of-function
mechanism that results in destabilization of the nucleosome and transcriptional de-repression. In Aim 1, we will
interrogate fundamental features of MACROH2A1 in a human model of neurodevelopment, which enables us to
probe human-specific processes that cannot be modeled in other systems. Further, the phenotypic overlap
between our patients and those with other RI-histonopathies suggests that studying how the recurrent
MACROH2A1 mutation perturbs human neurodevelopment will provide key insights into other histonopathies.
Thus, in Aim 2, we will quantify the epigenetic dysregulation caused by our patients’ mutation. This work will be
performed in the extensively characterized KOLF2.1J-background hiPSC line. We are employing a multifaceted
approach involving analysis of publicly available transcriptomic data, RT-qPCR, quantitative mass spectrometry,
ChIP-seq, CUT&RUN, cytosine base editing, bulk RNA-seq, EdU incorporation assays, FACS analysis, nuclear
co-immunoprecipitation and ATAC-seq to complete these aims. Our results will advance the field of
developmental histone biology and have great translational impact, including establishing a foundation for
therapeutic development for the histonopathy patient population that currently only receives palliative measures.
The proposed work will be carried out in the world-class training environment cultivated between the University
of Pennsylvania and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, within the Bhoj Lab, which has a history of making
profound advances in the histone biology field. Additionally, the guidance from an exceptional sponsorship team
of Drs. Bhoj and Hakonarson, in conjunction with collaborators who are pioneers in their fields, will enable the
successful completion of this fellowship proposal and the development of a competent, independent investigator
capable of producing rigorous and reproducible patient-driven work."

 Our goal in this R15 proposal is to investigate the photoreduction of Pt(IV) complexes as a new versatile
approach for NIR-uncaging that can operate both in vitro and in vivo. Photo-uncaging is a technique that
selectively blocks biologically relevant functional groups, enabling external spatiotemporal control with light.
Targeted light-induced cleavage is used to achieve uncaging and release the photolabile protecting group,
providing a means to regulate the amount of the relevant compound released. However, the current limitation of
photolabile protecting groups has largely restricted photo-uncaging technology to the use of UV light. NIR light
(700–1000 nm) can penetrate deeper into biological tissues, making it a promising candidate for biomedical
research and phototherapy. This R15 proposal aims to present a new approach toward overcoming such
drawbacks by inventing novel fluorophore-conjugated Pt(IV) complexes for NIR-uncaging. The central
hypothesis is that photoreduction of Pt(IV) complexes enables NIR-uncaging of bioactive ligands. This
hypothesis is based on our preliminary data: 1). photoinduced electron transfer empowers rapid activation of
Pt(IV) complexes via conjugation with fluorophores. 2). conjugation of the Pt(IV) complex with IR780 (a lipophilic
NIR dye) enables photoreduction upon NIR irradiation. 3). the use of carboplatin as the Pt core generate Pt(IV)
complexes with excellent stability against biological reductants without additional protection. 4). the fluorophores
being used in the scaffold dictate the wavelength of light irradiation from visible to NIR. To test our central
hypothesis, we hereby present a three-year research project composed of two specific aims. Aim 1 of our
proposal is dedicated to synthesizing new Pt(IV) complexes using the aforementioned scaffold and investigating
their photo-uncaging properties. In Aim 2, we aim to enhance the potential of our newly developed photo-
uncaging technology by validating and optimizing NIR-uncaging of drug molecules in vitro and in vivo. Successful
completion of Aim 1 will not only illustrate the scaffold's adaptability but also provide valuable information on the
photoreduction properties of the Pt(IV) complexes. The successful completion of Aim 2 could lead to the
development of a new NIR photo-uncaging technology with numerous noteworthy applications in different
domains, including drug delivery and phototherapy. The educational goal of this R15 proposal is to enhance
undergraduate student biomedical research at Kent State University (KSU). Based on the different background
of the two PIs, including bioinorganic chemistry and cell biology, we seek to establish a multidisciplinary research
program to support three undergraduate students and one graduate student at KSU every year."

Cardiovascular diseases are not only the leading cause of mortality in the world, but they also lead to almost

determinants of health play a significant role in these disparities, we cannot overlook the biases that have
perturbed existing genomic studies on which we base the development of precision medicine technologies. Of
the ~6,300 studies currently compiled in the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) catalog as of March 2023,
~95% of all GWAS participants are of European (EUR) ancestry with less than 1% of participants being of African
American (AFR) ancestry. Attempts to translate genetic research findings into clinical practice may be not just
incomplete, but dangerously mistaken and misapplied. With the advent of large and diverse patient biobanks,
there needs to be a targeted focus on studying genetic variations specific to ancestries that are too often
understudied. The Penn Medicine BioBank serves as an ideal discovery vehicle for this purpose with a repository
of genotype, whole-exome sequencing, and electronic health record (EHR) data as well as one of the largest
AFR populations at any single-institutional medical biobank in the US, to our knowledge. We hypothesize that
by using a genome-first AFR-specific approach, we will identify significant genetic associations for HLBS
disorders that would have otherwise been missed by previous EUR-dominant studies and future multi-ancestry
approaches. We will curate a list of AFR-specific predicted loss-of-function and missense variants, and then
through HLBS-focused phenome-wide association studies, we will characterize the clinical manifestations of the
diseases caused by these protein-altering variants. Furthermore, genome-wide association studies will be used
to identify genetic loci with significant discrepancies in effect across ancestries and uncover variabilities in HLBS
disease prevalence. To investigate these ancestry-specific risk loci, we will employ local ancestry inference to
study ancestry-dosage effects and construct haplotypes to uncover drivers of the observed phenotype
associations. This proposed project has the potential to broaden our understanding of genetic risk for HLBS
disorders and significantly impact the development of diagnostic and therapeutic methods. Beyond that, our work
embodies the vision that the advancement of personalized medicine should benefit every patient of every
ancestry and socioeconomic background."

 The structural integrity of the skin is dependent on appropriate cell attachment to the basement
membrane, which forms the foundation of the epidermis and separates it from the dermis. Laminins are the major
component of the basement membrane, where integrin receptors form adhesive contacts and connect the
intracellular cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. Integrins are heterodimeric adhesion receptors that link cells
to components of the extracellular matrix and to other cells, and they are essential for cell adhesion, migration,
and multicellularity. Laminin binding integrins are fundamental in attaching epithelial cells to the basement
membrane.
 In humans, a well conserved family of proteins, the tetraspanins, have been shown to bind and form
signaling complexes with laminin-binding integrins. Tetraspanins are a class of four-pass transmembrane
domain proteins with diverse biological roles involving modulation of the trafficking, membrane localization, and
signaling of their various partners. The interaction between tetraspanins and integrins remains an exciting area
of research as in vivo evidence suggests the interaction is necessary for normal integrin function. The tetraspanin
CD151 binds all laminin binding integrins but associates most stably with the laminin-binding integrin α3β1
(ITGα3β1). Silencing mutations in either CD151 and ITGα3β1 both result in epidermolysis bullosa (EB), a
disease phenotype consistent with impaired laminin binding and basement membrane attachment. However,
why integrin function is diminished in this disease remains unclear, and whether CD151 affects
ITGα3β1conformation or affects its activity through other signaling mechanisms is unresolved.
 Integrins characteristically exist in three conformations which each conferring different ligand affinity.
CD151 may bind to and stabilize a specific ITGα3β1 conformation. This proposal will use structural approaches
to determine if ITGα3β1 signaling is CD151 dependent due to conformation regulation. Additionally, signaling
may be dependent on other downstream signaling mechanisms. I will use a proximity labeling time course
approach to define the dynamic response to integrin activation and the influence of CD151 on ITGα3β1 signaling.
These approaches will determine how CD151 modulates ITGα3β1, which can be applied to understand general
tetraspanin and laminin binding integrin signaling biology. Although tetraspanins have many interaction partners
and are implicated in various biological processes, the mechanism by which they engage and modulate their
binding partners remains understudied. Specifically, understanding the CD151-ITGα3β1 signaling complex and
its role in epidermal adhesion could be exploited therapeutically to strengthen epidermis attachment in EB and
potentially other diseases of the skin."

Assigning the mode of action to bioactive compounds is an essential step in drug discovery and a major challenge
in chemical biology. This problem is particularly acute for drug discovery from nature. Natural products (NP)
provide unique scaffolds not found in synthetic libraries, and the abundant NP collections are a vast diversity
reservoir for drug development. However, the lack of mechanistic understanding is a major hindrance to preclinical
development. Existing HTS techniques permit efficacious screening of NP libraries, but the follow-up purification,
chemical structure identification, and MOA assessment of purified metabolites are lengthy, costly, and tedious.
Worse, as the MOA is determined only at the end, much effort is wasted on isolating redundant and irrelevant hits.
Since the purification of active constituents requires significant work, it should be performed only for high-value
molecules with pharmacological novelty.
 Currently used MOA assessment approaches employ various platforms, including panels of cell-based and
biochemical assays and systems biology techniques, but none provide a satisfactory solution for the MOA
problem. Here, we describe an alternative MOA evaluation technique based on a systems biology approach
developed at Attagene. Under this approach, cell response is characterized by the activity of transcription factors
(TF) that link cellular signaling pathways to genes. The enabling technology is the FACTORIAL, a proprietary
Attagene platform for quantitative TF activity profiling (TFAP). We demonstrated that TFAP signatures enable a
straightforward MOA assessment of chemicals by pinpointing perturbed bioprocesses and cell systems. Most
importantly, this approach does not involve complex bioinformatic inferences. Here, we will extend the TFAP
approach to ascribe the MOA to anticancer drug leads from nature. In pilot studies, we examined TFAP
signatures of approved anticancer drugs and anticancer fungal metabolites. We found that (i) major classes of
approved anticancer drugs have specific TFAP signatures; (ii) anticancer fungal metabolites, too, have distinct
TFAP signatures. Moreover, these signatures allowed correct identification of metabolites' MOA; (iii) most
unexpectedly, crude fungal extracts and purified active metabolites showed identical TFAP signatures. These data
suggest a new approach to the mechanistic evaluation of nature-derived anticancer leads. We will develop this
approach with a UNC-Greensboro team with over 700 purified anticancer fungal metabolites with established
structures. First, we will obtain TFAP signatures for all FDA-approved drugs and a large fraction of the UNCG
library (SA1). Then, we will analyze these TFAP datasets and compare the 'MOA spaces' for the anticancer fungal
metabolites and approved drugs to identify metabolites with novel MOA (SA2). Finally, we will validate the
approach to identify the MOA in crude fungal extracts, allowing prioritizing high-value strains for purification
(SA3). Implementing this proposal will establish a new approach that uses a single instrumental platform,
does not involve bioinformatic analyses, and allows ascribing the MOA to unpurified NP extracts."

 Cognitive functions of the brain are underpinned by complex and highly dynamic neural activities at the
sub-cellular levels and millisecond time scales. To discover the normal/abnormal neuronal activities and thus
understand detailed mechanisms of neurological disorders and dysfunctions such as Alzheimer’s,
Parkinson’s disease and ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), measurement tools that offer sufficient
spatiotemporal resolution are needed. Fluorescence imaging/microscopy is one of the state-of-the-art
technologies for high spatial resolution recording of the activity of neuron populations. However, existing
fluorescence neural imaging technologies generally have limited speed, providing less than a few hundred
frames per second at most. High-speed imaging is particularly challenging for miniaturized, head-mounted
imagers used for in vivo studies on freely-behaving animals. The milliseconds or slower temporal resolution
substantially precludes measuring the precise timing of the generation and propagation of neuron spikes,
which is the key component of neural signaling. Moreover, current head-mounted fluorescence imagers use
epi-fluorescence illumination, which cannot reject out-of-focus background fluorescence, resulting in low
discrimination of voltage-sensitive signals from the thin membranes of individual neurons.
 During this R&D program, Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard
propose to develop and demonstrate a high-speed (>kHz frame rate), head-mounted, confocal imager
that can optically capture neuronal electrical activity with high spatiotemporal details. Technology
innovations are proposed to enable this capability. First, an “active sensing” signal detection method
combines two complementary imaging channels to achieve parallel neuronal recording with both sub-micron
spatial resolution and sub-millisecond temporal resolution. Second, a novel hybrid fiber bundle scanning
approach achieves confocal imaging capability based on a miniaturized optical setup. During the proposed
Phase I, we will demonstrate the feasibility of the technology by imaging cultured neurons and brain slices
labeled with voltage fluorescent indicators. Then, we will upgrade the technology to a miniaturized imager to
further demonstrate its performance during in vivo imaging of mice. These test experiments will demonstrate
high spatiotemporal resolution recording of fast action potentials from individual neurons and sub-cellular
neuron structures (e.g., dendrites and synapses). This R&D project will result in a robust technology for non-
invasive recording of neuronal kinetics with high spatiotemporal resolution on freely-behaving animals,
offering a critical tool for neuroscience research."
10821906,"Project Summary/Abstract:
The cornea, the tissue that makes up the front of the eye acts as a barrier between the environment and the eye
and focuses light onto the lens and then to the retina. Degradation of the cornea, commonly found in keratoconus
(KC), leads to progressive vision loss requiring ever increasing prescriptive correction and historically culminating
in corneal transplant. Despite the rise of the corneal crosslinking procedure to slow degradation, little is known
about the etiology of KC and/or the long-term effects of the crosslinking procedure on KC, including its long-term
efficacy.
In combination with a lack of in vivo models that accurately reflect KC, there is a lack of commercial corneal
models on the market. Current models, such as Mattek’s EpiOcular and EpiCornea consist purely of corneal
epithelial cells and are aimed at basic drug transport and irritation studies. While academic models are
significantly more advanced, recapitulating multiple cell types, none of the models recapitulate corneal curvature.
Further, few models incorporate flow analogous to the that of the tear film and aqueous humor: the tear film
represents a rich source of biomarkers that can be easily sampled non-invasively and aqueous humor generates
the pressure force that maintains the shape of the eye. Therefore there is a need to recapitulate flow and forces
in corneal models.
Overall there is a lack of physiological relevance in commercially available cornea models and a need for a more
advanced in vitro model.
We propose to develop a model that meets these needs. The key innovations of this model will be 1) the
incorporation of corneal geometry, and incorporation of 2) flow (tear film) and 3) pressure effects (IOP).
The Phase I effort will focus on providing a proof of concept for these key innovations. The phase II will focus on
demonstrating the model validity for KC through extensive comparison between healthy and KC diseased models
derived from KC patient cells. The model will be marketed initially to the KC research community for basic
research studies and pharmaceutical companies evaluating crosslinking and other KC therapeutics and then
extended to sales to the general corneal drug and research market."

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is highly aggressive and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. TNBC
is a major cause of death among breast cancer patients and is the only subtype of breast cancer that still has
few effective therapeutic options. This study addresses this critical medical need by co-targeting poly (ADP-
ribose) polymerase (PARP) and STAT3 in both BRCA-mutant and BRCA-proficient TNBC cells. TNBC frequently
harbors BRCA mutation, which results in dysfunctional DNA repair mechanisms. PARP inhibition, in conjunction
with the loss of DNA repair via BRCA-dependent mechanisms, resulted in synthetic lethality and augmented
TNBC cell death. In addition, recent reports indicate that PARP inhibitor in combination with a few drugs that can
induce a BRCAness phenotype, is also effective in BRCA-proficient cancer cells. However, treatments with
single-agent PARP inhibitor are not durable, leading to resistance to therapy and disease progression. TNBC
cell lines secrete the highest levels of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) compared to other subtypes of breast cancer cell lines,
and IL-6/STAT3 signaling confers resistance to anti-cancer drugs. In addition, our novel preliminary results
demonstrate that the PARP inhibitor talazoparib can induce the IL-6 and phosphorylated STAT3 levels in TNBC
cells, and talazoparib-treated TNBC cells could potentially become more resistant to talazoparib therapy by
augmenting the IL-6/STAT3 axis and targeting STAT3 may potentiate TNBC cells to talazoparib therapy. This is
supported by STAT3 siRNA can sensitize TNBC cells to talazoparib. Our central hypothesis is that dual
inhibition of PARP and STAT3 by talazoparib and LLL12B combinational therapy is an effective approach to
inhibit tumor growth, recurrence, and metastasis in both BRCA-mutant and BRCA-proficient TNBC cells. This
hypothesis is supported by our novel preliminary results that (1) STAT3 inhibitor LLL12B and STAT3 siRNA can
induce a BRCAness phenotype in BRCA-proficient TNBC cells, supporting PARP inhibitor therapeutic utility in
BRCA-proficient TNBC as well when combined with LLL12B, and (2) the combination of talazoparib with LLL12B
synergistically inhibits cell viability and significantly inhibits cell migration of BRCA-mutant and BRCA-proficient
TNBC cells. We will test the hypothesis by two specific aims: (I) Evaluate the activity of talazoparib and LLL12B
combination in inhibiting BRCA-mutant TNBC tumor expansion, recurrence, and metastasis using orthotopic
mouse tumor models in vivo. (II) Evaluate the efficacy of talazoparib and LLL12B combination in inhibiting BRCA-
proficient TNBC tumor growth, recurrence, and metastasis using orthotopic and syngeneic mouse tumor models
in vivo. This study is novel and significant because it seeks to extend current PARP inhibitor treatment, which
is only limited in BRCA-mutant TNBC into synergistically co-targeting PARP and STAT3 in both BRCA-mutant
and BRCA-proficient TNBC. If successful, our long-term objective of translating this novel therapeutic
approach of talazoparib and LLL12B combination into clinical evaluation has a potential to improve patient care
and survival for women that are affected by BRCA-mutant and BRCA-proficient TNBC."
10783927,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tobacco use is the top preventable cause of early mortality in schizophrenia, leading to a 20-year decreased life
expectancy compared to the general population. Current smoking cessation treatments are derived from people
without psychosis and are significantly less effective for people with schizophrenia. We used a data-driven,
agnostic approach to identify a schizophrenia-specific circuit of nicotine dependence (the Default Mode Network,
DMN) then tested pharmacologic and neuromodulation interventions on this circuit. We observed craving was
bidirectionally mediated by DMN connectivity: 1) nicotine administration (which reduces craving) decreased DMN
connectivity in schizophrenia, while 2) a single session of intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS), which
increases connectivity, applied to a DMN node acutely increased craving in schizophrenia. This provides
evidence that 1) nicotine craving is mediated by this network and 2) this target can be engaged bidirectionally
via multiple interventions. This K23 mentored patient-oriented career development award proposes to test if
multiple repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) sessions lead to enduring circuit change and reduce
nicotine craving. Our central hypothesis is that the brain circuit most effective to reduce nicotine craving in
schizophrenia is distinct from the pathway identified in a non-schizophrenia population. To test this hypothesis,
we will compare 1) DMN-targeted continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) to 2) iTBS targeted to the left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L DLPFC), which reduces cigarette consumption and craving in smokers without
psychosis. cTBS has been shown to decrease network connectivity. By applying cTBS to the DMN, we aim to
decrease connectivity, thereby decreasing craving. We will determine if rTMS manipulates functional connectivity
and craving and if craving change correlates with connectivity change for each rTMS target. To optimize rTMS
response, we will also test if variability in rTMS response is explained by individual differences in network
controllability. The applicant is a psychiatrist with fellowship-level training in neuroimaging and rTMS for
substance use disorders in schizophrenia. Her long-term career goal is to build an independent research
program using neuroimaging to identify brain networks linked to substance use in psychotic disorders then test
neuroscience-based, network-targeted rTMS interventions in clinical trials for co-occurring substance use
disorders in schizophrenia. To accomplish these goals, the applicant requires additional training in: 1) design
and conduct of personalized network-targeted rTMS interventions, 2) individualized neuroimaging to optimize
rTMS response, and 3) clinical trials and biostatistics. Training will include formal coursework, didactics, and on-
site trainings, guided under a mentorship team of experts in network-targeted rTMS interventions in psychotic
disorders, computational analysis of networks in psychotic disorders, and clinical trials design for rTMS and
smoking cessation. Mentored training and completion of the proposed project will provide the applicant the skills
and experience necessary to launch a successful independent research career."

 Mutations in USH2A (usherin) are common causes of autosomal recessive blinding diseases in
non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa as well as syndromic Usher syndrome type II that manifests
congenital hearing loss as well. There is no effective therapy for these diseases. How usherin

pathological mechanisms and for development of effective therapies to preserve or restore vision.
This project is aimed at generating an usherin-deficient model that recapitulates the phenotypes found
in human patients."

Poverty long has been recognized as an important social determinant of health. Despite many years of progress,
in 2018 nearly 10% of the world's population lived in extreme poverty — below $1.90 per day. The Covid-19
pandemic has further increased poverty, leading to a 12% increase in extreme poverty in 2020, with ongoing
increases in low-income countries in 2021. Large-scale, government-led cash transfer programs that provide
money to individuals or households (with or without conditions) have been a vital part of poverty reduction
strategies in many countries during the past two decades. Unlike multi-country evaluations of major health aid
programs like PEPFAR, the vast majority of studies of cash transfer programs have focused on individual
countries and impacts on beneficiaries in those countries, generally using datasets that are not large enough to
precisely estimate effects on mortality rates and many other important health outcomes. In recent work, we used
data from 37 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and numerous Demographic and Health Survey (DHS)
surveys to generate longitudinal mortality datasets for about 7 million adults and children. Using a difference-in-
differences approach, we found that government-led cash transfer programs resulted in large and statistically
significant reductions in mortality among adult females (adjusted risk ratio 0.80) and children <5 years of age
(adjusted risk ratio 0.90), but not among adult males or older children. This work raises an important question
about the possible pathways that explain these findings, including behavioral pathways (such as increased
engagement in health-promoting behaviors like antenatal care or childhood vaccination) as well as health and
nutrition pathways (such as improved child nutrition). The proposed project will address this question by
combining DHS data with our newly constructed database of cash transfer programs, using difference-in-
differences analyses to examine the association between cash transfer programs and outcomes among adult
females and children <5 years of age. Aim 1 of the project will assess the association between cash transfer
programs and key behavioral outcomes that might affect mortality rates and other health outcomes, and Aim 2
will assess the associations between these programs and key health and nutrition outcomes that are of
considerable interest themselves and might also mediate effects of cash programs on mortality rates. Regression
models will include country and year fixed effects and time-varying confounders at the individual- and country-
levels. We will conduct secondary and sensitivity analyses like temporal analyses and alternative modeling
approaches to assess the robustness of our results, including use of alternative estimators to address bias that
can be introduced in difference-in-differences analyses with variation in intervention timing. At a time when many
countries are considering scaling-back or expanding cash transfer programs, this project has the potential to
have timely public-health and policy impact by producing a comprehensive, global assessment of the causal
effects of cash transfer programs on key child- and maternal-health outcomes."

Despite often being used legally, cannabis use is associated with several harmful outcomes (e.g., mental
health problems). Moreover, cannabis use is disproportionately higher among sexual minorities (SM) relative to
their heterosexual counterparts. SM who use cannabis are also more likely to develop cannabis use disorder
(CUD) compared to heterosexuals. Our understanding of mechanisms that explain disparities in SM cannabis
use outcomes is nascent. In line with NIDA’s funding priorities to identify mechanisms underlying differences in
SM drug use outcomes, this K99/R00 application aims to evaluate mediators of associations between minority
stressors, cannabis use, and use-related negative outcomes among young adult SM. The minority stress
psychological mediation framework posits that minority stressors result in substance use outcomes through
impaired coping, interpersonal, and cognitive processes. This model has support for SM alcohol use; however,
only eight studies have tested putative mechanisms explaining how minority stressors relate to cannabis use.
Among these studies, many are cross-sectional and most solely test coping motives mediation. Longitudinal
research examining how minority stressors and these mechanisms relate to use and negative outcomes (e.g.,
CUD) is necessary to address these research gaps and advance understanding of SM health. Moreover,
identifying how daily experiences relate to use will provide targets for prevention and intervention development,
particularly when certain experiences (e.g., stigma) may be unavoidable. This K99/R00 study leverages
ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to capture real-time measures in daily life of stressors, cannabis
use, and related outcomes. Foundational work during the K99 phase will collect data to inform EMA item
development (Aim 1), then conduct an EMA feasibility and acceptability study (Aim 2). Dr. Parnes’ training
goals include (1) refine skills to independently design, develop, execute, and analyze EMA research, (2) build
expertise in conducting substance use research with SM populations, (3) continue training in advanced
statistical modeling of EMA data, and (4) promote a successful transition from postdoctoral fellow to
independent faculty researcher. Dr. Parnes’ mentorship team, Drs. Miranda, Mereish, and Treloar Padovano,
are experts in EMA, sexual minority research, and advanced statistical analysis. These training goals build on
Dr. Parnes’ F32 (DA054718), which provided foundational training in identifying mechanisms of behavior
change in adolescent cannabis treatment. Using the protocol finalized through the K00, the R00 study will
conduct a 30-day EMA study among SM who use cannabis to test putative mechanisms relating daily minority
stressors to use-related negative outcomes (Aim 3). Findings from the proposed study will inform whether and
how SM minority stressors relate to harmful use-related outcomes. Evaluating mechanisms can also be used
to identify intervention targets to complement or replace cannabis use, thus reducing liability for CUD or other
negative outcomes, and reducing known health disparities in this population."
10808448,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Childhood maltreatment is a major public health problem that is a risk factor for substance use across the
lifespan. Emotion regulation (ER) is a modifiable mechanism underlying the impact of maltreatment on
substance use but is often impaired in youth with a maltreatment history due to the neurotoxic effects of early
trauma and/or neglect. Interventions to support the development of adaptive ER in youth with a maltreatment
history have the potential to interrupt trajectories of risk and enhance health outcomes, yet this population is
often difficult to reach and frequently faces structural and psychosocial barriers to engagement in intervention.
Furthermore, the child welfare system, which is designed to protect and support youth with maltreatment
histories, is under resourced and often unable to meet the critical needs for prevention in this population.
Interventions targeting substance use with this population must be acceptable, easily accessible, and low
resource for the child welfare system. iTRAC is a tablet-based ER skills training intervention for early
adolescents that previously demonstrated good feasibility and acceptability, as well as increases in emotional
self-efficacy, emotional awareness, and use of ER strategies with community samples of urban adolescents.
iTRAC’s approach of delivering ER content through a technological platform may effectively engage and
promote ER and prevent substance use among youth with maltreatment histories. This tablet-based approach
may also be more sustainable in child welfare settings than approaches that require a trained clinician.
However, no prior work has examined iTRAC with this vulnerable population. In collaboration with the Rhode
Island Department of Children, Youth, and Families, the proposed research will innovate and enhance the
existing iTRAC intervention to integrate substance use content with the goal of reducing substance use among
child welfare involved youth. This work will occur in two phases. During the Planning and Intervention
Enhancement Phase (Phase I), we will interview adolescents, caregivers, and child welfare professionals to
obtain their diverse perspectives regarding the integration of ER and substance use. We will subsequently
create and program this content within the iTRAC framework, followed by acceptability testing to ensure
usability and understanding. Upon completion of Phase I, we will begin Phase II, during which a real-world
efficacy (hybrid efficacy-effectiveness) trial of youth with maltreatment histories will test the impact of the
iTRAC for Substance Use (iTRAC-SU) intervention over an 8-month follow-up period. We will also assess the
feasibility, acceptability, uptake, and costs of this approach. Trial results, and qualitive interviews with child
welfare professionals at the end of the project, will inform sustainability planning beyond the project period."
10930135,"Next generation sequencing and other -omics technologies have spurred the development of precision
medicine, but this field is still in its infancy for alcohol use disorder (AUD). Transcriptomic studies have
established that alcohol use causes widespread changes in brain gene expression. Brain gene expression
profiles can identify alcohol-dependent human subjects and mice and can be used to repurpose
pharmaceuticals that reduce excessive alcohol consumption in rodents. However, it is not possible to obtain
brain samples from living patients, which limits the translational potential of this approach. Routine blood
testing has long been a part of medical care. Blood genomic profiles could potentially be used to non-invasively
determine whether a patient is at risk for AUD, provide data-driven diagnosis of AUD, stratify the
heterogeneous AUD patient population for clinical trials, select optimal therapy, and monitor treatment
response and disease progression. As a first step toward these goals, Dr. Ferguson analyzed gene expression
patterns in paired blood and brain samples from mice subjected to chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure,
a mouse model of alcohol dependence. Blood gene expression signatures of CIE predicted a pharmaceutical
that reduced alcohol drinking in mice, and predictive models built from blood profiles distinguished between
CIE and air-exposed mice with high accuracy. These results lead to the hypothesis that blood can serve as a
proxy for brain tissue in molecular-based diagnostic or therapeutic tools and advance personalized medicine
approaches for AUD. However, it is not known whether there is a biological signature of AUD in blood from a
human population. Furthermore, there is a need for biomarkers to predict and monitor treatment success and it
is unknown whether blood gene expression profiles might be useful in this regard. The CIE blood signature
used in the previous study assayed the transcriptome only at a single time point. Therefore, the dynamics or
ongoing transition of important gene regulatory functions were not investigated. These gaps in knowledge will
be addressed in proposed Aims by analyzing blood profiles (1) across multiple time points throughout alcohol
withdrawal in humans (Aim 1), (2) across multiple time points through the development of CIE-induced alcohol
dependence in mice (Aim 2), and (3) before and after treatment in humans and mice (Aim 3). The overarching
hypothesis is that genomic profiles from blood will improve the clinical management of AUD including
diagnosis, prognosis, and predicting treatment response. These Aims and the accompanying training plan
were designed to build on Dr. Ferguson’s previous research experiences and facilitate new scientific training in
clinical alcohol research and biostatistical analyses of longitudinal data, time-to-event outcome data, and
treatment effect estimation. The proposed Pathway to Independence Award will generate new knowledge
about a relatively unstudied area in alcohol research and enable Dr. Ferguson to establish a solid framework
for building a successful research program as an academic translational neuroscientist in the alcohol field."

African Americans (AA) are at disproportionate risk for earlier and more pronounced cognitive and functional
decline and increased frailty. Structural racism (SR)—the systems and processes that create and sustain race-
based inequities—is posited as the fundamental driver of accelerated aging and multi-level determinants through
its impact on the built and social environment (BSE).
We posit that greater and prolonged exposure to historical,
enduring, and contemporary (HEC) SR-BSE across the life course promotes greater cognitive and functional
declines and increased frailty among AAs. It remains crucial to a) understand the longitudinal relations of
cumulative, lifetime exposure to multiple indicators of HEC SR-BSE practices to cognitive aging, functional
decline, and emerging frailty; b) delineate variations by race, age, sex and perosn-level socioecnoic status in
these linkages; c) evaluate the role of interpersonal discrimination in this context; and d) identify underlying
mechanistic pathways of risk (e.g., cardiometabolic disease) and resilience (e.g., social capital). The current
project will be the first to thoroughly assess and integrate these goals. Linked to the ongoing Healthy Aging in
Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) epidemiological cohort study, we propose an
investigation of up to 800 midlife to older AA and White men and women (ages 30-64 at baseline), tracked up to
13 years across three waves, residing in Baltimore, Maryland. Our sample was born in Baltimore, the U.S. city
with the longest history of legalized BSE-based structural racism. This will allow detailed study of cumulative life
exposure to the H&C markers we characterize through lifetime residential histories and contemporary activity
spaces, obtained by calendar interview and LexisNexis commercial data and linked to rich administrative and
archival data from the last 100 years. We will first model potential interactive and independent relations of H&C
SR to longitudinal change in cognitive and physical function and frailty with effect modification by race and sex.
We will then build structural equation models to address the direct and indirect paths of influence exerted by
H&C SR on trajectories of change in these outcomes via neighborhood BSE, interpersonal discrimination, and
additional psychological, behavioral, and biomedical factors. We will partner with the Baltimore Neighborhood
Indicators Alliance to disseminate our findings to support local, ongoing advocacy and policy work for
transformative health equity changes to the BSE, particularly around housing. Understanding and disseminating
patterns and mechanistic processes linking H&C SR to accelerated cognitive aging, functional decline, and frailty
is critical to the development of appropriate strategies to disrupt racial inequities in accelerated aging via the
BSEs where they live."

cause mortality). Insulin action is a potent predictor of the FEC impairment in T2D. The exact relationship
between insulin action, cardiac and muscle dysfunction, cardiac and skeletal muscle perfusion and decreased
FEC in T2D remains unclear. Here we propose to address this gap in knowledge by defining the roles of impaired
insulin-mediated cardiac and skeletal muscle perfusion and exercise performance in people with T2D.
Hypothesis: Decreased insulin-mediated muscle perfusion found in T2D contributes to the development
of cardiac and skeletal muscle dysfunction and subsequent impairment in exercise capacity. We further
hypothesize that exercise training attenuates insulin resistance and restores insulin-mediated perfusion
to the skeletal and cardiac muscle, leading to improved exercise performance. Specific Aim 1: To test
the hypothesis that impairment in insulin-mediated cardiac perfusion limits exercise performance
through its effect on cardiac function in people with T2D. We will examine the relationship between insulin-
mediated cardiac perfusion, other measures of cardiac function, and VO2 peak at rest and with exercise in
subjects with and without T2D. Given that there is a sex disparity in diabetes outcomes and exercise impairment
with a lack of mechanistic insights on sex differences, we will analyze all parameters for differences by sex on
an exploratory basis in the three aims. Specific Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that impaired insulin-mediated
skeletal muscle perfusion limits exercise performance through its effect on oxidative capacity in people
with T2D. We will examine the relationship between insulin-mediated skeletal muscle perfusion; muscle
oxygenation, skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and in vivo skeletal muscle oxidative flux; and VO2 peak in
subjects with and without T2D. Specific Aim 3: To test the hypothesis that the improvement in FEC
subsequent to exercise training operates via action on cardiac and muscle function in T2D. These
experiments will test whether the improvements in VO2peak observed with exercise training correlate with
improvements in insulin-mediated perfusion, cardiac and skeletal muscle function and the impact of T2D on
these changes. Understanding the role of microvascular disease in the diabetes-mediated exercise impairment
may offer novel targets for intervention to improve exercise capacity, functional status and longevity in people
with diabetes. Together, our two groups will employ complementary theoretical backgrounds and research
methods in a synergistic approach to address the innovative hypothesis posed to improve health in T2D."

Ewing sarcoma is a highly aggressive bone and soft tissue cancer that is caused by the EWS-FLI1 fusion
protein. The EWS-FLI1 oncoprotein functions, in part, as an aberrant transcription factor and is required for
tumor growth and survival. However, directly targeting EWS-FLI1 with drugs has been challenging and, as a
result, there is a critical need to identify downstream targets of EWS-FLI1 and unique vulnerabilities incurred
by the oncoprotein. In order to identify downstream targets of EWS-FLI1, we used human embryonic stem cells
that express inducible EWS-FLI1 to model the initiation and development of Ewing sarcoma in a genetically
defined system. We then used this model system and a gene expression based approach to identify that Ewing
sarcoma cells are uniquely vulnerable to inhibitors of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), including gemcitabine,
which impair DNA replication by blocking the synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides. Moreover, we have also
identified that the inhibition of RNR in Ewing sarcoma cells results replication stress, activation of the unfolded
protein response, and a block in the synthesis of proteins required for the response to impaired DNA
replication. Notably, the combination of gemcitabine with an inhibitor of checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1), the major
regulator of the response to impaired DNA replication, results in synergy in vitro and a significant prolongation
of mouse survival in xenograft experiments. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will now pursue the
following specific aims: 1) dissect the molecular basis of the activation and regulation of the unfolded protein
response in Ewing sarcoma cells treated with inhibitors of ribonucleotide reductase; 2) test the in vivo efficacy
of gemcitabine and a second-generation CHK1 inhibitor, prexasertib, using Ewing sarcoma xenograft models;
and 3) use high-throughput screening to test candidate therapeutics identified using our gene expression
based approach for activity against Ewing sarcoma cells. These aims will be tested using a combination of
approaches in cancer cell lines, cell line xenografts, patient-derived xenografts, and our isogenic, genetically
defined cell lines. This work will be significant because it is expected to have translational relevance for the
treatment of children and adults with Ewing sarcoma tumors, as well as lead to a broader understanding of the
basic mechanisms of tumorigenesis in Ewing sarcoma tumors. The proposed research is innovative because it
integrates a novel, stem cell model of Ewing sarcoma with a gene expression signature based screening
approach to identify new therapeutic targets."

A concomitant rise in adolescent social media use and decline in adolescent mental health over the last
decade has raised the question as to the degree of relationship between these factors. To better understand
this relationship, we examine how passive social media use (pSMU)—monitoring other people’s lives without
engaging in direct exchanges with others—leads to poor mental health (Aim 1), when people engage in pSMU
and how this coping strategy impacts mental health (Aim 2), and for whom pSMU is likely to undermine mental
health (Aims 3) in a longitudinal study (n=400) in adolescents (ages 13-17; 50% Male/Female; 50%
Black/White youth). There will be a 2-month focused study period. The initial and final 2 weeks of the 2-month
study period will use ecological momentary assessment-based surveys (5 prompts a day) to measure pSMU,
and to characterize affective responses to both pSMU and stress exposures the youth encounter in daily life.
Objective pSMU will also be measured using an app installed on the youth’s phone in order to continuously
measure pSMU over the entire 2-month intensive study period. We will measure stress exposures and
responses in two novel ways. First, using GPS tracking we will determine the youth’s exposures to objectively
stressful environments (i.e., high crime areas). Second, we will use GPS to trigger EMA prompts at locations
youth reported as being stressful at baseline. The influences of these experiences on mental health trajectories
(measured at weeks 0,2,4,6,8 and 20 will be assessed. Additionally, we focus on the relationship of pSMU to
two physiological pathways that are responsive to social stress and influence risk for poor mental health: a) the
parasympathetic nervous system, the function of which will be continuously measured using a self-charging
wristband worn by the youth for the entire 2-month intensive study period to quantify shifts in heart-rate
variability (HRV); b) and the expression of immune and other socially stress responsive gene pathways in
blood cells sampled on week 0,2,6, and 8. This will provide the opportunity to determine the effects of pSMU
on momentary affect, momentary HRV, immune related gene expression, a marker of general inflammation
(CRP), and changes in depressive symptoms (Aim 1). We will also determine the role of stressor exposure
(self-reported and GPS based) upon pSMU (Aim 2a) and the degree to which pSMU as a stress coping
strategy moderates the effects of stressor exposure on affective response, HRV, stress related gene signaling
pathways, inflammation, and mental health measures (Aim 2b). To examine individual differences in these
effects, we will determine the degree to which gender is associated with increased pSMU (Aim 3a) and
whether gender moderates responses to pSMU (Aim 3b). Finally, because our sample will be half Black youth,
we will also determine if race moderates the relationship between GPS derived stress exposures (including
GPS determined exposure to heavily policed areas or racially exclusive areas) and pSMU (Aim 3c)."
10932992,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) continues to be a significant problem, affecting 28.3 million adults in the United
States, and is the third leading preventable cause of death. Disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate are the only
drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration, but all three have limited efficacy and several
contraindications. Given the substantial burden on society and the economy ($249 billion in 2010), there is a
clear unmet need for effective and well-tolerated therapies that reduce alcohol dependence and relapse in AUD
patients. AUD is characterized by phases of binge drinking, intoxication, and negative emotional states during
withdrawal. The anticipation of alcohol leads to a repetition of these phases followed by periods of extended
abstinence and frequent relapse. Importantly, each of these phases is accompanied by sleep disturbances (SDs).
Three primary brain regions are involved in AUD-associated behavior: the prefrontal cortex (anticipation), basal
ganglia (binge drinking), and amygdala (withdrawal). Several neurotransmitters are dysregulated in AUD,
including the glutamatergic system. Extensive experimental evidence suggests that glutamate (Glu) critically
modulates the actions of drugs of misuse, including alcohol. Therefore, normalization of aberrant Glu activity
caused by chronic alcohol use potentially represents a novel therapeutic strategy to prevent relapse in AUD. The
activation of metabotropic Glu receptor subtypes 2 and 3 (mGlu2/3) using agonists or positive allosteric
modulators (PAMs) decreases ethanol (EtOH) self-administration (SA) as well as cue-induced reinstatement of
EtOH seeking in rodents. Both alcohol-dependent rodents and humans show downregulation of mGlu2
expression, and many studies suggest that deficiencies in mGlu2 signaling may underlie AUD pathology.
Moreover, preclinical studies indicate that mGlu2/3 activation has promise for treating stress- and anxiety-related
disorders in humans and can systematically augment sleep, symptoms that are comorbid with AUD. We
hypothesize that mGlu2 PAMs represent a promising new class of drugs to treat AUD. To test this hypothesis,
our team has discovered and optimized three small molecule mGlu2 PAMs, SBP-9330, SBP-1315, and
SBP-9220, that show efficacy in multiple models of substance-use disorders. To accomplish this, our specific
aims are (1) Determine the in vivo efficacy of mGlu2 PAMs to decrease EtOH intake in rat models of dependent
and non-dependent EtOH SA, (2) Determine the in vivo efficacy of mGlu2 PAMs to normalize SDs during
withdrawal and abstinence following EtOH SA, and (3) Determine the effect of a fixed dose of EtOH on the PK
profile and maximum tolerated dose of mGlu2 PAMs in rats. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team of
investigators with the expertise and experience to achieve these outcomes. Successful completion of these
studies will facilitate the development of a novel mGlu2 PAM towards filing of an investigational new drug (IND)
application and ultimately, a safe and effective treatment for AUD."

Germinal matrix-intraventricular hemorrhage (GM-IVH) is a major complication of premature birth, occurring in
up to 45% of very low birthweight neonates (<1500 g) due to fragility of immature blood vessels within the
germinal matrix. GM-IVH can also lead to hydrocephalus (HCP) and increased intracranial pressure, which
further induces inflammation and brain tissue injury. Though neonatal GM-IVH and HCP are increasingly
common due to the rising survival rate of preterm births, there are no established biomarkers or guidelines for
their treatments to prevent brain injury. Preterm infants with GM-IVH/HCP are vulnerable to alterations in cerebral
blood flow (CBF) because they have impaired cerebrovascular autoregulation. However, there are no reliable
functional imaging methods at the bedside of neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) for repeatedly assessing
either degree of cerebral injury or effectiveness of interventions. Near-infrared spectroscopy and tomography
technologies have been used for decades as noninvasive bedside tools for continuous monitoring of cerebral
blood oxygen saturation (StO2). However, most systems lack the combination of spatial resolution and wide field-
of-view (FOV) to image distributed brain functions and discriminate the brain signal from overlaying scalp and
skull. A few high-density tomographic systems use numerous discrete sources and detectors coupled with fiber
bundles to a head cap. However, adjusting and maintaining a stable optical coupling of numerous fibers to a
small fragile neonatal head (i.e., a contact measurement) is labor-intensive and poses great challenges to head
cap design with safety concern. To overcome these limitations, we propose to develop a novel, noncontact,
high-density-detection (using a CCD/CMOS camera), multi-wavelength speckle contrast diffuse correlation
tomography (MW-scDCT) system to accommodate fast, high-resolution, functional imaging of both CBF and
StO2 over a large FOV on the neonatal head. The MW-scDCT will be rigorously calibrated and optimized using
standard tissue phantoms (Aim 1). In vivo calibration/evaluation will be conducted against MRI and histological
examination in an IVH/HCP model of neonatal piglets who preserve great similarities with human neonates (Aim
2). A pilot clinical observational study will be performed in preterm neonates with GM-IVH/HCP under standard
of care in the NICU (Aim 3). Cerebral hemodynamics/metabolism, cerebrovascular autoregulation, and cerebral
functional connectivity will be analyzed from serial functional images taken over several weeks after birth. We
hypothesize that cerebral hemodynamic/metabolic alterations detected by MW-scDCT correlate with
progression of brain injury after GM-IVH/HCP and recovery after treatment. Multiple parameters will provide
more comprehensive assessments of neonatal brain injury/recovery compared to a single parameter alone. This
study will fulfill a critical need in the field of neonatology to provide objective measures/biomarkers to guide timing
of treatment for GM-IVH and HCP. We anticipate that noninvasive, repeated, and longitudinal cerebral monitoring
for the guidance of interventions could be eventually implemented as standard of care in NICUs."
10817034,"Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are at the apex of the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cellular
hierarchy and have the capability of unlimited self-renewal and of initiating disease. The quiescent
fraction of LSCs provides a reservoir of self-renewing cells that sustain leukemia growth, prevent
clonal exhaustion, and are treatment resistant; thus eliminating LSCs is the “holy grail” of anti-
leukemia treatment. AML blasts profoundly modify the bone marrow (BM) niche by causing loss
of non-permeable arteriolar vessels in the endosteal marrow and enrichment of permeable,
fenestrated sinusoid vessels in the central marrow. The remodeled BM niche is permissive of LSC
expansion and leukemia growth, yet the fine molecular mechanisms of this vascular remodeling
remain to be fully elucidated. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that target
messenger RNAs and regulate protein levels. miR-126 plays an important role in quiescence,
self-renewal and drug resistance of AML LSCs. Recently we showed that miR-126 is mostly
expressed in the Sca-1+ endothelial cells (ECs) of arteriolar vessels, which are responsible for
supplying miR-126 in the BM niche. Under normal conditions, miR-126 supply from Sca-1+ ECs
regulates the homeostasis and activity of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). We discovered that
AML blast-secreted TNFα down-regulates miR-126 in Sca-1+ ECs and causes a loss of arteriolar
vessels. This results in a decreased supply of miR-126 to LSCs, which then engage the cell cycle
and induce leukemia growth. We also made the “key” observation that forcing miR-126 down-
regulation below the already decreased levels in the BM leukemic niche (hereafter referred to as
“miR-126 deprivation”), leads to further loss of arterioles which harms LSCs but not normal HSCs.
Restoring BM arteriolar vascularization in AML mice by neutralization of TNFα favors quiescent
LSC expansion rather than having an antileukemic effect by increasing endothelial miR-126
supply to these cells. Thus, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that the understanding of
the cellular and molecular basis of TNFα-induced miR-126 downregulation and its impact on BM
vascular remodeling in AML will allow us to design novel miR-126 deprivation-based treatments
that will eliminate homeostatic support to LSCs, rendering them vulnerable to anti-leukemic
therapies. Therefore, we propose the following Specific Aims (SAs): SA#1: To prove the central
role of the TNFα/miR-126 axis in vascular remodeling of the BM leukemic niche in AML. SA#2:
Define the molecular mechanisms of the TNFα/miR-126 axis in the vascular remodeling of the
BM leukemic niche in AML. SA#3: Therapeutic targeting of the leukemic vascular niche by a miR-
126 inhibitor in combination with commonly used antileukemic therapies."
10817035,"Proposal Title: The impact of social determinants, conditional cash transfers and primary health care on
HIV/AIDS: an integrated retrospective and forecasting approach based on a cohort of 100 million Brazilians
Project Summary
Considerable progress has been made in controlling many aspects of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. But
challenges remain in terms of scaling up successful national programs. This study will contribute to
knowledge on the impact of large-scale initiatives addressing both the social and medical determinants of
HIV/AIDS by combining data from Brazil’s national HIV/AIDS registry with other largescale databases
including the “100 Million Brazilian Cohort”: a virtual cohort of more than 100 million individuals over 18
years obtained by the linkage of large countrywide socioeconomic and health datasets. It will be the first
study to follow such a large number of individuals over time and in non-experimental conditions to
understand how social determinants, conditional cash transfers and primary health care affect HIV/AIDS
incidence, hospitalization and mortality; and how receipt of social protections at the individual level affects
HIV/AIDS outcomes (ART adherence and mortality). Thanks to the unprecedented dimension of the
dataset and the methods proposed, we will assess impact heterogeneities of the two interventions in a
large range of different subpopulations, as well as possible synergistic effects. Using the longitudinal aspect
of the cohort we will explore and assess in depth expected and unexpected dynamics, lagged and long-
term effects of changes in living conditions and in exposures to conditional cash transfers and community-
based primary health care. We will then expand the cohort and integrate estimates from the retrospective
evaluations with the development of forecasting for several alternative policy scenarios. Using an
innovative joined microsimulation and agent-based model we will be able to forecast the effects of the
current Brazilian economic crisis, overall and for several subpopulations, on the HIV/AIDS epidemic. We
will forecast and compare the impact of a wide range of alternative policy scenarios, such as the
maintenance of current levels of support of conditional cash transfer and primary care, reductions of
coverage and benefits due to fiscal austerity measures, or expansion in different subpopulation and with
different dynamics. We will calibrate and select the combinations of policy response able to maximize the
benefits on the HIV/AIDS epidemic, even during an economic crisis. The empirical results and the
innovative mathematical models produced in this project will represent an essential contribution to the
understanding and control of HIV/AIDS in lower and middle income country settings, as well as for
vulnerable populations in the United States."
10817037,"The largest population of upper limb amputees are those with partial hand amputations. This population
outnumbers all other levels of upper limb amputees by a factor of 10. Therefore, a significant clinical impact can
be made if a product serves this population effectively. The care of Veterans with upper limb amputations
requires a highly individualized approach to medicine. Each Veteran brings a unique presentation to the clinic
including levels of amputation, lifestyles, personal experience, and other medical indicators. They tend to be
highly active individuals with the need for a prosthesis to keep up with their daily life.
Prosthetists and occupational therapists work with each Veteran to provide a personalized medical solution using
available components and technologies on the open market. Often, a return to optimized function is limited by
the solutions available on the market, which provide insufficient durability, function, or a combination. To
compound this issue, no commercially available prosthetic finger is appropriately sized for the full range of female
hand sizes. Consequently, certain women Veterans with partial hand amputations are unable to obtain a
prosthesis that meets their needs.
To date, the VA Biomechatronics Development Laboratory (BDL) has developed a ratcheting prosthetic digit,
the Point Digit, that is now commercially available for use in partial hand prostheses. Through our prior Merit
Award [1I01RX002830], we successfully redesigned and prototyped this technology – the Women’s Digit – to
permit it to be sized for a 5th percentile female while maintaining an industry leading strength to weight ratio and
novel ratcheting mechanism.
The mission of the VA Biomechatronics Development Laboratory is to innovate devices and algorithms in the
field of upper limb prosthetic design. For this project, the BDL will complete a prosthetic solution that will meet
the unique needs of women Veterans and be responsive to the VA RR&D Request for Proposals (RFP) to
develop female Veteran specific prosthetic components. We will build upon our previous work to finalize and
translate this device to the field. We will: 1) finalize development through iterative fitting and testing of the
Women’s Digit and 2) conduct a take-home trial of women Veterans fitted with the Women’s Digit to assess
device efficacy. Our goal is to provide an effective solution for women Veterans to ensure their ability to enjoy
work and home life to the fullest."
10817040,"Project Summary:
A major challenge faced by all gene therapies directed to the central nervous system is delivering the therapy
across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in a way that achieves adequate central exposure while minimizing toxicity
in non-targeted tissues. The two most common routes of administration for delivering adeno-associated viral
(AAV) vectors, the only FDA-approved gene transfer platform for neurological applications, suffer from
complimentary limitations. Intravenous (IV) injection can achieve widespread distribution throughout the brain
but only at low concentration levels, while intraparenchymal (IPa) injections supply a high concentration of
therapy but only near the site of injection. As most neurological disorders manifest in multiple brain regions,
successful gene therapy treatments will require an improved approach to AAV delivery that can achieve high
therapy concentration and large volume coverage.
To address this critical bottleneck, we aim to develop and validate delivery strategies using the technology of
focused ultrasound (FUS)-mediated disruption of the BBB to significantly improve the concentration and brain
coverage of AAV-packaged gene therapies. In this project we will investigate the application of delivering an
AAV-packaged micro-RNA therapy targeting suppression of mutant Huntingtin, the gene implicated in
Huntington’s disease (HD). Our preliminary work demonstrates that FUS-BBB opening enhances the delivery of
IV-injected AAV1 and AAV9 vectors to targeted brain regions in wild-type and HD model mice. We additionally
have experience using our human clinical FUS system to achieve large-volume BBB disruption in rats, monkeys
and humans. Building off this preliminary data, Aim 1 will determine the optimal FUS parameters and AAV dose
for maximizing AAV concentration at the FUS-targeted site in HD model mice. The safety profile of each
treatment will be characterized in terms of markers of neuroinflammation and signs of trauma-like damage to
tissue. To maximize brain coverage, we will characterize the safety profile and AAV delivery efficacy as a function
of BBB opening volume in HD model mice. Aim 2 will incorporate the information gained in Aim 1 to devise an
optimal treatment strategy that balances high AAV concentration, large volume coverage and safety. We will
assess the safety and therapeutic efficacy of delivering an AAV-packaged microRNA to HD model mice at 1-, 3-
, 6- and 12-month time points in terms of mHTT lowering and functional markers of disease progression. In Aim
3, all of the mice data will be used to devise a treatment strategy for AAV delivery in rhesus macaque monkeys.
A safety and biodistribution study will be carried out in these non-human primates using our human clinical FUS
system. If successful, the strategies developed here would enable AAV delivery to the brain with a more favorable
safety and efficacy profile than existing alternatives and unlock the clinical promise of these transformative
therapies."
10817053,"Abstract
 Bioassay-guided fractionation of cells uncovers small molecules that bind receptors in new and unexpected
ways. These cellular metabolites emerge from evolution with complex molecular features preoptimized for
function. High stereochemical content, high globularity and diverse heteroatom content impart greater
specificity of protein binding and greater aqueous solubility than simple, flat and non-polar substances.
Parametrization of large molecular libraries have supported a correlation between evolutionary optimization
and therapeutic design: “drug” chemical space is optimized away from commercial building blocks and towards
natural products (NP space). These types of molecules represent a challenge to chemical synthesis, however,
and require the development of new chemical tools for optimization and human use.
 This grant advances our work towards the rapid access and navigation of NP space. Our robust routes to
complex molecules have proven practical: synthesis allowed us to annotate and modify biological function.
Over the coming grant period we extend this approach into three areas. First, we develop the chemistry to
access two chemotypes with known phenotypic effects but unknown biological targets. One target has
stimulated the discovery of a new, stereoselective cross-coupling reaction, whereas another has inspired the
conversion of inert scaffolds to new warheads for protein adduction. Second, we describe rapid access to
complex ligands of known biological targets that embody ‘combinatorial’ aggregates of multiple proteins.
Diverse structural modifications of the complex small molecule will enable a search for selectivity among these
combinatorial targets with consequences for therapeutic development. Third, selectivity defines the future
goals of dual-catalytic cross-couplings to reach NP space: we seek to address substrate selectivity, relative
stereoselectivity and absolute stereoselectivity."
10822410,"Significance: High-throughput optical microscopy is currently transforming the research fields of
genetics, drug discovery and neuroscience. Large-scale optical assays now routinely use thousands of
high-resolution images to offer critical insights into the human body, our brain, and the diseases that
affect us. Today’s optical microscopes and their associated image processing software, however, remain
far from ideal. Current microscopes 1) cannot form images with cellular-scale resolution over an area
larger than a few square centimeters, and 2) cannot readily obtain 3D measurements at high speed. This
fundamentally limits experimental capabilities, most notably within model organism research. For
example, current methods must constrain or sedate organisms like the zebrafish and Drosophila for in
vivo observation at cellular-scale resolution in 3D, which naturally alters their behavior and leads to slow
and cumbersome experiments.
Proposal: Ramona Optics aims to create a new micro-camera array microscope platform (MCAM-3D)
for parallelized high-content 3D imaging of unconstrained model organisms. Two unique features of its
novel arrayed design will be integrated within a single device to record 3D behavior and morphology: 1)
real-time stereoscopic 3D depth at video rates, and 2) the ability to image both specimen ventral (top)
and lateral (side) morphology using a new “periscopic” well plate that is composed of an array of tilted
mirrors. Jointly developed software for automated 3D image analysis will be developed to improve the
rigor, efficiency, and translatability of current model organism research and to produce new discoveries.
SA1 – MCAM-3D hardware and software for large-area, high-speed video: We will develop a 9x6 micro-
camera array (770 megapixels total) capable of rapidly re-focusing to one of 3 imaging configurations
(2D video, 3D depth, lateral view) and multi-gigapixel-per-second capture. Software will generate 3D
height maps in near-real time (<0.1 sec/frame) and execute per-organism tracking and pose estimation.
SA2: Lateral perspective imaging with the MCAM-3D: A custom periscope well plate will re-direct light to
simultaneously provide 54 unique lateral viewpoints at 6 µm two-point resolution within each well.
Software will automatically register images and execute organism tracking and pose estimation.
SA3: Annotation software for 3D behavioral and morphological analysis: We will create open-source
software for automated detection and tracking of user-defined features of interest. Machine learning
software will form per-organism feature “dictionaries” for statistical analysis with clustering software.
SA4: Experimental demonstrations of the MCAM-3D: We will complete a drug screen assay with the
McCarroll Lab (sub-award, UCSF) to measure 3D feeding behavior, and a developmental assay with the
Bagnat Lab (sub-award, Duke) examining lateral morphology, to solidify a product-ready MCAM-3D."
10822082,"Summary: Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a progressive heart disease ranging from aortic valve sclerosis
to aortic valve stenosis, characterized by severe calcification with impaired leaflet function. CAVD affects 25%
of the population over 65 years of age and about 50% of those over 85 years old. Male sex is one of the major
risk factors of CAVD. Currently, the standard-of-care treatment of CAVD is surgical valve replacement, but there
are no drugs approved by the FDA for CAVD treatment, calling for urgent research and drug development efforts.
There are no good animal models that develop age and sex appropriate CAVD and are ideal for research and
drug development. Mouse models that are currently used to study CAVD also develop atherosclerosis. while
atherosclerosis is a major risk factor of CAVD, the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis and CAVD are quite
distinct. Aberrant transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling plays a key role in the pathogenesis of CAVD.
Our preliminary studies indicated that transgenic overexpression of a constitutively active form of TGFβ1 in valve
interstitial cells (VIC) (via Tgfb1Tg;PostnCre) causes CAVD in both sexes, and older male transgenic mice (8-10
months of age) predominantly progress to severe form of CAVD. We developed a novel In vitro mouse VIC
calcification assay for both male and female sex and found that natural compound emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-
methylanthraquinone) significantly blocked the progression of VIC calcification in vitro. An preliminary in vivo
study showed that systemic delivery of emodin for 8 weeks was able to attenuate and/or reverse the established
aortic valve calcification in Tgfb1Tg mice. Emodin has been investigated as a potential therapy for various
diseases, but there is not enough attention paid to its therapeutic potential in CAVD. AcePre LLC and its
associated laboratories at the University of South Carolina have studied emodin for multiple years and
accumulated an extensive dataset related to its pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and therapeutic efficacy in various
disease models. In this STTR Phase 1 project, we aim to take the emodin therapy forward using our unique
clinically relevant mouse models of CAVD. Our hypothesis is that emodin may block the development and
progression of CAVD and even lead to a reversal of CAVD by tempering the aberrant TGFβ signaling. Two
specific aims are proposed. SA1: Test the hypothesis that emodin blocks the development and progression of
calcific aortic valve disease. SA2: Test the hypothesis that emodin treatment will reduce or reverse the
preexisting CAVD. Upon completion of this STTR Phase 1 project, we will in a Phase II project: 1) use large
animal models to find a dose range that can be extrapolated to humans and test the safety and efficacy of emodin
for the treatment of CAVD in a GLP setting, and 2) carry out cGMP manufacturing of emodin for human studies.
These studies will enable us to file an investigational new drug (IND) application to FDA. The development of
this emodin-based therapy may reduce or eliminate the need for surgical AV replacement in patients with CAVD."

In the proposed research, GlycoT will expand its cutting-edge chemoenzymatic platform by further optimizing
and streamlining a one-pot single-zyme glycan-specific conjugation technology, that can be applied to a wide
variety of application. Conjugation of various functional molecules to antibodies are frequently used for a wide
variety of applications within the life science sectors, such as fluorescent labeled antibodies for the detection and
imaging, antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) for cancer therapy, LYTAC for targeted degradation. The most
exemplified application of antibody conjugation is the development of ADC therapeutics. For approved 15 ADCs
and others in clinical trials, the payloads have been mainly conjugated to antibody by non-specific random linkage
to either cysteine or lysine, resulting in heterogenous ADC regioisomers, with varied antigen affinity, aggregation
potential, serum half-life, and other limitation. As a result, site-specific ADCs with improved pharmacokinetics,
and enhanced therapeutic index have been developed. Among different approached to generate site-specific
ADCs, remodeling of Fc-glycan on the conserved Asn-297 position to generate Fc-glycan specific ADC is
particularly attractive. The use of the galactosyltransferase (GalT) mutants capable of accommodating modified
UDP-Gal derivatives as the donor substrates has enabled the incorporation of a selected tag at the Fc glycans
for subsequent site-specific conjugation with modified cytotoxic agents. This technology route has been adopted
by several clinical stage companies. However, the GalT mutant is not very efficient and can only transfer azide
or keto based small Gal-GDP derivative. In contrast, another endoglycosidase-based one-pot transglycosylation
method has overcome such limitations. This convergent approach combined two key enzymatic steps,
deglycosylation of the antibody, and subsequent attachment of a tagged disaccharide, in the same reaction
system, with a single endoglycosidase like EndoS2 from S. pyogenes. This one-pot platform has been
exclusively licensed by GlycoT. The core enzyme EndoS2 is highly efficient and can transfer azido disaccharide
modified with single or multiple extended linkers, as demonstrated in the proof-of-concept studies. In the
proposed Phase 2 R&D, GlycoT will streamline this amazing bioconjugation technology by pursuing the following
five specific aims: Aim 1. Scale-up and optimization of the synthesis of disaccharides oxazolines, Aim 2.
Combability of single-enzyme transglycosylation with engineered human IgG, Aim 3. Design and evaluate
EndoS2 fusion enzyme to further simplify the glycoengineering process, Aim 4. Streamline the whole process
to synthesize glycan-specific ADC, Aim 5. In vivo evaluation of glycan-specific ADCs. With the successful
execution of this R&D plan, for the academic researchers, we can provide convenient, highly efficient, and robust

10822118,"Recent technological advances that allowed for the mapping of selected RNA modifications on a transcript-wide
scale have revealed a wide-spread distribution of N6-methyladenosine (m6A), pseudouridine (Ψ), 5-
methylcytosine (m5C), ribose 2’-O-methylation (Nm), and adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing on mRNA.
The m6A is the most abundant base modification in RNA (over 118,000 m6A peaks in human transcriptome),
and controls a plethora of systems, including stem cell proliferation and differentiation, cellular heat shock
responses, spermatogonia differentiation, maternal-to-zygotic transition, X-chromosome inactivation, UV DNA
damage response, neurogenesis, and tumorigenesis. A variety of illnesses have been further linked with m6A
methylation disorder, including acute myeloid leukemia, gliomas, breast cancer, and lung cancer in humans.
Despite widespread recognition of the important functions of RNA modifications, the availability of technologies
that can monitor and image site-specific RNA modifications are lacking. Novel tools for the site-specific
detection of RNA modifications in cells and other biological samples are urgently needed. The overall goal
of this project is to develop novel, easy to use fluorescence-based methods and reagents for sequence
specific imaging of RNA modifications. The goal of Phase I was to establish the feasibility of novel m6A
antibody-based imaging reagents. In Phase I, we have developed the first-in-class and the best-in-class
homogeneous antibody-based novel assays to determine the extent of site-specific m6A RNA modifications.
Furthermore, we greatly exceeded the original goal of Phase I by developing an additional novel “no antibody”
method which entirely avoids the use of m6A antibody, reducing reagent’s complexity and cost. With these two
novel methods established in Phase I, we are ready to move into a Phase II project. Our aims include Aim 1.
Develop optimal protocols for staining fixed cells using the methods established in Phase I. Aim 2. Test methods
to increase sensitivity of detection. Aim 3. Evaluate and compare the performance of all method variants using
cell culture systems. Aim 4. Expand and validate the methods to measuring other RNA modifications such as A-
to-I RNA editing and m5C. In addition, all the methods, reagents, and protocols developed and validated
internally by Mediomics will be sent to a leading laboratory in this field for third party validation to ensure that
Mediomics' newly developed assays work well in any laboratory that may have an interest in epitranscriptomics
and the quantification of RNA modifications. Successfully validated assay kits will be ready for commercialization.
These novel methods could become the first standard approach for analyzing RNA modifications in any sample
and will enable researchers to perform fluorescence-based imaging for RNA modifications in important biological
samples, including brain and cancer samples. It may further serve as an important diagnostic or prognostic
clinical tool for detecting altered modification levels in the mRNA of tumors."

 Trainees with engineering and technological backgrounds have been traditionally underrepresented in the
kidney research field. We propose a new research educational program entitled MERRIT: Multidisciplinary
Engineering and Renal Research for Innovation of Technology as a joint venture between Mount Sinai Division
of Nephrology and Cooper Union School of Engineering. Our program will have three major foci: (1) building
sustainable awareness of clinical and patient needs in the kidney field among engineering trainees; (2) creating
innovative team-based and individual research experiences for undergraduate and graduate engineering
students; and (3) organize and disseminate pedagogical and educational lessons from the program through
web and media such that other institutions can develop similar programs successfully. We have assembled a
mentoring team comprising physician scientists and transplant nephrologists and basic scientists in the kidney
field as well as engineering faculty from electrical, mechanical and chemical engineering departments.
Mentors with complementary skills from the two institutions will supervise patient-centered student-initiated
design projects as well investigator-initiated individual kidney research projects. Through achievement of our
aims, we will generate a sustainable pipeline for training of future kidney researchers and nephrologists that

 The mucosal immune system fosters a delicate regulatory environment which provides protection from
gastric pathogens while maintaining oral tolerance to food. Tolerance to food antigens occurs through the
induction of peripheral regulatory T cells (pTreg) and their regulatory suppressive functions. Moreover, dendritic
cells (DCs) play a central role in maintaining tolerance to dietary antigens. However, enteric virus infections, like
reovirus, can elicit pathological processes leading to the initiation of T helper 1 (Th1) immunity against dietary
gluten resulting in loss of oral tolerance (LOT) and celiac disease (CeD). CeD is a digestive disorder
characterized by an inflammatory CD4 T helper 1 (Th1) immune response to dietary gluten found in wheat,
barley, and rye. Even though 30% of people carry the genetic alleles predisposing to CeD, only 1% develop
disease, suggesting that additional genetic and environmental factors such as enteric viral infections contribute
to pathogenesis. The high prevalence of CeD and the challenges associated with maintaining a gluten-free diet
make CeD a significant burden in modern health care. New strategies to promote oral tolerance and to prevent
or revert LOT in CeD patients upon exposure to gluten antigens are still needed. We hypothesized that certain
gut microbes have the capacity to protect against virus-mediated LOT and development of CeD. By using our
previously defined virus mediated LOT CeD model, we discovered that the gut colonizing protist Tritrichomonas
arnold (T. arnold) promotes oral tolerance and protects against virus-mediated LOT. Moreover, our studies using
human stool samples support a role for Tritrichomonas spp. colonization in protecting against development of
CeD. Mechanistically, our findings show that T. arnold promotes oral tolerance by engaging dietary antigen
presenting DCs and restraining the reovirus induced proinflammatory program of dietary antigen presenting DCs
and thus limit their ability to promote Th1 immune responses. In this proposal we will use conceptually and
technically innovative approaches to further gain insights in how T. arnold-derived compounds modulate dietary
antigen presenting DC responses under homeostatic conditions and inflammatory microbial triggers.
Furthermore, using our LOT CeD mouse model we will interrogate a druggable candidate pathway identified in
our T. arnold DC-RNA-sequencing screen that has been associated with tolerogenic immune responses. The
findings of this proposal will provide insights into novel approaches for preventing LOT in at-risk individuals and
re-establishing oral tolerance to gluten in CeD patients."
10820753,"ABSTRACT
Appropriate response to injury is critical for epithelial barrier function and organismal health. In order to restore
tissue homeostasis after injury, stem cells must receive signals from their surrounding niche to adjust their
proliferation and differentiation at defined stages of repair. The dynamic mammalian intestinal epithelium is a
well-suited barrier to approach this problem, as it constitutes the first line of host defense against diverse forms
of potentially disease-causing environmental insults and is rapidly replenished by defined populations of
intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Located at the base of crypts of Lieberkühn, ISCs are relatively protected from
these insults, yet need to sense external factors in order to regulate functions including stem cell state,
turnover, and lineage allocation, each critical for maintaining barrier integrity. While certain signaling
mechanisms that maintain some ISCs decisions are known, how ISCs adapt to environment influences that are
durable and communicative to other ISCs is unclear. This proposal tests the hypothesis that ISCs engage
in phagocytosis of dead cells as a means for sensing the health of intestinal tissues in which they
reside, and that this mechanism underlies durable and widespread alterations in stem cell function.
The supporting idea is built off of a surprising, but still untested discovery made half a century ago by pioneers
in this field – that ISCs can engulf dead neighboring cells. Using modern techniques, my preliminary data
support this capability and indicate that ingestion of apoptotic intestinal epithelial cells impacts ISC proliferation
and differentiation. In Aim 1, I will determine the mechanism of ISC uptake of dead cells by employing discrete
and bioactive cargo, spheroids derived from mouse and de-identified human samples, as well as in vivo mouse
models. In Aim 2, I will test the mechanisms by which dead cell engulfment alters ISC function through cutting-
edge lysosomal purification techniques, genetic models, and in vivo models of epithelial injury. The proposed
research will lay the groundwork for understanding fundamental intestinal stem cell biology that forms the basis
of sensing environmental cues that can trigger adaptive responses for maintaining optimal tissue and
organismal health. This knowledge will pave the way for future efforts to understand and leverage key intestinal
stem cell biology as therapeutic targets to address a wide range of disease states."
10820761,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
9% of children born in the United States are admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit where many experience
invasive surgical procedures as part of their medical care. The resulting tissue damage leads to ‘priming’ of the
nociceptive pathway, causing increased pain perception in response to noxious stimuli later in life. Long-term
potentiation (LTP) of sensory synapses onto projection neurons (PN) in the spinal superficial dorsal horn (SDH)
likely contributes to the sensitization of spinal pain circuits by amplifying ascending nociceptive transmission to
the brain. While primary afferent-to-PN synapses typically follow ‘Hebbian’ spike timing dependent plasticity
(STDP), in which presynaptic firing just prior to postsynaptic firing induces LTP, neonatal incision widens the
window of stimulation that induces potentiation, facilitating the amplification of pain transmission. It is becoming
increasingly clear that astrocytes are critical modulators of synaptic transmission, capable of altering the subunit
composition of postsynaptic α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) type glutamate
receptors. However, nothing is known about how astrocyte-synapse communication is involved in the priming of
nociceptive circuits, posing a critical gap in knowledge as insight into astrocytic regulation of plasticity in spinal
PNs will advance our understanding of the molecular basis of STDP, and potentially reveal novel therapeutic
targets to attenuate long-term amplification of nociceptive transmission. The long-term goal is to facilitate
development of chronic pain treatments by advancing our understanding of central nociceptive circuit
development. The short-term goal of this application is to elucidate the role of astrocytes in STDP of sensory
synapses onto SDH PNs involved in the priming of pain pathways after early life injury. Prior studies demonstrate
that neonatal incision persistently increases CP AMPAR expression and relaxes the rules of STDP in PNs.
Recent evidence that astrocytes dynamically inflect plasticity and selectively modulate AMPAR subunit clustering
via secreted factors support the concept that astrocytes are critical for the synaptic changes occurring as a result
of neonatal priming. The central hypothesis is that astrocytes reacting to neonatal surgical incision secrete
factors that recruit Ca2+ permeable (CP) AMPAR, thus fostering an environment permissive to non-Hebbian
LTP at primary afferent-to-PN synapses. This hypothesis will be tested via two aims. Aim 1 will identify the role
of astrocytes in reorganizing postsynaptic glutamate receptor expression after neonatal injury, while Aim 2 will
determine the degree to which astrocytes facilitate LTP in the SDH after early life injury. The proposed research
will identify novel mechanisms by which spinal astrocytes modify glutamate receptor expression and contribute
to the development of persistent changes in activity-dependent potentiation of sensory synapses onto PNs.
Results will further our understanding of how neuron-glial interactions are involved in the persistent changes to
synaptic plasticity of spinal nociceptive circuits involved in neonatal priming, which will contribute to foundational
knowledge for developing therapeutics that disrupt aberrant potentiation."
10820994,"Abstract
 Autoimmune diseases can occur in nearly any part of the body, and pose a significant problem in
human health, including both systemic autoimmunity and tissue-specific autoimmunity. 1.25 million
Americans have type 1 diabetes (T1D), where the immune system destroys insulin-producing beta cells.
Although exogenous insulin can control blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes, glucose homeostasis
is difficult to maintain and serious long-term complications including nephropathy, retinopathy, and peripheral
neuropathy are far too common. Since the first procedure using the Edmonton protocol in 1999, islet
transplantation has established itself as a promising therapy for patients with longstanding T1D, and beta cell
replacement using replenishable sources like human embryonic stem cell-derived beta cells has the potential
to become curative. Islet transplantation requires a drug regiment to suppress the immune response from
allorejection as well as autoimmune attack against pancreatic b cells, resulting in chronic immunosuppression
with its own severe complications, exposing patients to risk of infection and malignancies. Immunotherapies
that provide local inhibition of immune response to the graft, without systemic immune inhibition, are a critical
need. Immune cells have receptors that can either activate or suppress an immune response. Sialic acids
incorporated into glycans have the ability to bind to a family of predominantly inhibitory receptors on the
surface of many immune cells. We have shown that the sialic acid transferase ST8Sia6 generates ligands for
the inhibitory receptor Siglec-E, which is expressed on innate immune cells. In addition, our work
demonstrated that ST8Sia6 expression on tumor cells leads to enhanced growth and protection from the
immune response. Here, we generated a novel line of mice in our laboratory where ST8Sia6 is constitutively
expressed in pancreatic b cells in the NOD mouse model of Type 1 diabetes (“NOD bST mice”). NOD bST
mice are strongly protected from the development of diabetes; only 6% of NOD bST female mice became
diabetic as compared to 60% of NOD female littermate controls. Strikingly, NOD bST mice possessed a
durable tolerance towards b cells, as protection was maintained after ST8Sia6 expression was inhibited with
doxycycline. The focus of this proposal is to understand the changes in the immune response that occur with
ST8Sia6 expression in b cells, and whether ST8Sia6 expression on b cells provides enhanced protection
from immune attack after transplantation. By doing these experiments in mice, important information will be
gained that may be translated to the clinic for islet replacement therapy for patients with T1D."
10796185,"Understanding the Neurophysiology of Ankle Instability to Improve Rehabilitation Outcomes
Abstract
Chronic ankle instability is a common debilitating orthopedic condition that disrupts physical
function and decreases quality of life. Chronic ankle instability is heterogenous and can manifest
as mechanical ligamentous laxity, perceived disability often referred to as functional instability,
or a combination of the two. However, clinicians and researchers most often combine all chronic
ankle instability patients without considering these subgroups, which may account for the poor
recovery and recurrent nature of this pathology. Neurocognitive and neurophysiologic
discrepancies may explain the different subgroups observed in this population, however,
technological limitations have previously limited this assessment. The objective of our research
is to determine functional and neurophysiological differences between subgroups of chronic
ankle instability to allow for development of evidence-based rehabilitation which may improve
patient outcomes. To accomplish this, the aims of this study are to determine 1) the differences
among CAI subgroups on performance of a traditional side-hop test and neurocognitive hop
test, 2) differences in neurophysiological response and motor control between chronic ankle
instability subgroups during a lower limb and an ankle specific task, and 3) the underlying
neurophysiological effects of a 4-week neurocognitively enhanced balance training protocol
among CAI subgroups. We hypothesize functional performance will be similar between
subgroups during a traditional side-hop test, but those with functional instability without
mechanical laxity will perform worse during a choice-reaction hop test compared to those with
mechanical ankle instability. We also hypothesize individuals with functional ankle instability will
demonstrate greater cortical activation during the research tasks, and after a 4-week balance
training protocol compared to individuals with mechanical ankle instability. To assess our aims,
individuals with chronic ankle instability who present with functional ankle instability as well as
with mechanical ankle instability will perform a series of hop tests, single limb balance test, a
force control test, a neurocognitive assessment, and 4-weeks of neurocognitive balance
training. Time to complete each of the hop tests, cortical activation during the balance and force
control tasks, and neurocognitive performance will be assessed to determine differences in
performance and neurological function among subgroups of chronic ankle instability. Therefore,
the long-term objective of this research is to determine the underlying neurologic,
neurophysiologic, and motor control mechanisms underpinning chronic ankle instability to
improve evidence-based decision making across patients with chronic ankle instability."

The psychological symptom cluster is a common problem that impacts women receiving breast cancer
treatment and is associated with several negative outcomes, including reduced functional status and quality of
life. Unfortunately, the mechanism(s) that underlie this cluster are unknown which limits the development of
targeted interventions. Mounting evidence suggests that individual (e.g., age, education) and community-level
determinants of health (e.g., neighborhood deprivation, pollution) increase psychological symptoms in women
with breast cancer. While exercise can improve psychological symptoms in women with breast cancer, it is
unknown if individual or community-level factors impact this relationship. Given that exercise, individual, and
community-level factors can alter DNA methylation, evaluation of epigenetic regulation may provide new
mechanistic insights. Investigation into the epigenomic, individual, and community-level factors associated with
a psychological symptom cluster in women with breast cancer within the context of a randomized clinical trial
for a moderate-intensity aerobic exercise intervention will clarify these relationships and inform the
development of targeted interventions. The overarching goal of this research is to alleviate symptoms in cancer
patients, which is a research priority of the NCI’s Division of Cancer Prevention. The aims of the K99 study are
to (1) test the hypotheses that epigenomic, individual, and community-level factors are associated with
psychological symptom cluster severity profiles in women with breast cancer prior to the start of aromatase
inhibitor therapy; and (2) test the hypotheses that epigenomic, individual, and community-level factors are
associated with worsening psychological symptom cluster severity profiles following six months of aromatase
inhibitor therapy in women with breast cancer, while exercise and epigenomic factors mitigate this effect. The
candidate will extend this line of research to immunotherapy, which is rapidly emerging as an adjuvant therapy
for breast cancer. The detailed training plan, exceptional team of mentors, and research-intensive environment
of the University of Pittsburgh will provide the candidate with the mentored training, support, and research
experience needed to conduct this research. Through this training plan, the candidate will develop: proficiency
in epigenomics; competency in analysis and bioinformatics of longitudinal epigenomic data; proficiency in the
evaluation of social determinants of health in symptom science; expertise in the mechanisms of
immunotherapy-related symptoms; and knowledge and skills for professional career development. The aims of
the R00 study are to: (1) identify symptom cluster profiles of women with breast cancer receiving
immunotherapy over time; and (2) evaluate for epigenomic, individual, interpersonal, community, and societal-
level factors associated with symptom cluster severity profiles of women with breast cancer receiving
immunotherapy over time. Findings from these projects will provide new knowledge to guide clinical
assessment and the development of targeted interventions to mitigate the severity common symptom clusters."
10796419,"To bring equity principles to research and practice of cancer screening and early detection, we will build a
CSRN ACCESS Hub at Siteman Cancer Center. Improving early detection is critical to reducing the growing
burden of cancer in our society and has the potential to reduce cancer health disparities. For this to happen,
research must not only include groups who have traditionally been marginalized and under-represented in
research, we must consider those communities in research design and conduct. Research conducted at the
Siteman Catchment Hub will prioritize rigor, equity, diversity, and inclusion of under-represented
populations. We represent a collaboration of Siteman Cancer Center and seven community-based healthcare
systems in Missouri and Illinois. Led by an experienced multi-disciplinary team, our time-tested administrative
structure engages representation from participating sites, community partners, community-based clinicians,
and institutional experts in this endeavor. We draw on the deep clinical research infrastructure and supports at
Siteman Cancer Center and Washington University School of Medicine, and organized our Hub into four cores:
Administrative, Participant, Study Protocol, and Data. We are founded on intentional integration, engagement,
and transparent communication strategies. The specific aims of our Center are: (1) Contribute to the
scientific development of CSRN research including an initial Multi-Cancer Detection Vanguard study that is
inclusive of diverse populations and considers health equity in its approach; (2) Recruit and retain diverse
participants to CSRN studies with representation across rural and urban, income and insurance, and racial
and ethnic backgrounds; and (3) Implement CSRN protocols, including diagnostic follow-up as needed.
Building on our experience conducting research that includes groups traditionally under-represented in
research, we propose to enroll 2000 individuals across our region into the Vanguard study, with at least 50%
from rural areas and 25% from racial and ethnic groups under-represented in research, and with purposeful
inclusion of low-income and under/ un-insured adults. We will work closely with community partners to support
recruitment and ensure protocols are accessible to diverse individuals. The Siteman Catchment Hub has
several notable strengths and innovations. First, we serve and are committed to populations that are medically
underserved and under-represented in clinical research. Second, our multidisciplinary leadership team is
dedicated to equity and inclusion, and has deep experience with cancer screening research and clinical trials.
Third, we engage organizational partners and community partners in Hub leadership. Fourth, we have strong
institutional support and infrastructure that will support the conduct of this research, access to quality data, and
rigor in our approach. We need sound evidence to inform advances in cancer screening and early detection,
including considering feasibility and acceptability of future implementation in diverse settings and populations.

Head and neck cancers are the fifth most common cancer type in the United States, with an overall survival
rate lower than 50%. Although the incidence of other sub-sites of head and neck cancer has decreased
steadily in past decades, the number of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) cases has
increased significantly. Most OPSCC patients receive standard cancer therapy.4 However, the clinical
outcomes vary significantly and are difficult to predict. Predicting early in treatment whether a tumor is likely to
respond to treatment is one of the most difficult yet important tasks in providing individualized cancer care.
 Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a known driving oncogenic factor in oropharyngeal cancer, as well as a
significant prognostic biomarker for patient survival. Retrospective studies conducted by the International Head
and Neck Cancer Epidemiology Consortium (INHANCE) have demonstrated that clinical biomarkers have
prognostic value in helping stratify OPSCC patients into groups with differing risks of death or disease
progression. However, HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer patients have similar rates of metastatic spread to
HPV-negative patients. The same is true for patient groups stratified with other clinical biomarkers. More robust
prognostic biomarkers are needed to accurately stratify patients for optimally effective treatment.
 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that collectively control the
expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. Multiple studies indicate that miRNAs are promising cancer
biomarkers and play critical regulatory roles in oropharyngeal cancer. Imaging features extracted from medical
images are an exciting new class of cancer biomarkers for characterizing tumor habitats. For several tumor
sites, imaging biomarkers have shown promise in accurately separating favorable and unfavorable prognosis
patients. However, current efforts to utilize high-dimensional multimodal biomarkers for treatment outcome
prediction have been compromised by small patient numbers relative to the feature space dimensionality;
feature redundancy, heterogeneity, and uncertainty; and patient cohorts with unbalanced outcomes. The
correlation, independence, and complementary nature of multimodal biomarkers (imaging, miRNA, HPV,
clinical, and histopathologic biomarkers) remains unexplored as well.
 The major goal of this research is to develop a multimodal biomarker-based model that can reliably predict
subsets of OPSCC patients with low and high risks for treatment failure. The model will serve as a clinical
decision-making tool. Specifically, we propose a novel principle and systematic machine learning-based
strategy to effectively identify and seamlessly combine prognostic information carried by multimodal
biomarkers. Aim 1: Identify prognostic multimodal biomarkers, given OPSCC patient data. Aim 2: Develop and
test a comprehensive multimodal biomarker-based model for predicting OPSCC treatment outcomes. Aim 3:
Assess the clinical benefit of the model for OPSCC patient stratification and individualized treatment."

The Upper Midwest Regional Coordinating Center (RCC), previously the University of Minnesota (UMN) RCC, is an established, high-performance RCC within Stroke Net. The pillars of the Upper Midwest Stroke Net RCC are: 1) unparalleled expertise in clinical trial conduct with a track record of high enrollment, most notably in complex time-sensitive acute stroke trials, 2) close collaboration with robust stroke care systems in the upper Midwest led by our colleagues and former trainees, and 3) direct integration with physician-scientist training programs. The Upper Midwest RCC comprises 12 sites with large urban and rural catchment areas throughout Minnesota and neighboring states. Our leadership is uniquely qualified, complementary, and aligned with Stroke Net aims. Dr. Streib (PI), the Cerebrovascular Director at M Health-Fairview (MHFV), developed a centralized internal stroke research network across MHFV hospitals. Within this network we are driving clinical research innovation: ~50% of our acute stroke trial participants are enrolled utilizing “remote research” in which the subject is not physically in the same location as the clinical and research teams. Remote research expands access to clinical trials more equitably thereby reaching diverse, underrepresented populations in clinical trials. Dr. Lakshminarayan (PI, Career Enhancement Director) directs the Clinical Research Training Program in the nationally-ranked UMN School of Public Health. She is an NIH-funded investigator whose research deliberately involves low-resource health systems, including federally qualified health centers, in order to ensure recruitment of under-represented minorities. Ms. Staugaitis' accumulated experience as project manager for Stroke Net, Strategies to Innovate Emergency Care Clinical Trials Network (SIREN), and essential multicenter COVID trials has been critical to operationalizing practical, efficient, and effective clinical research workflows. M-Health Fairview sites are top enrollers in multiple StrokeNet (MOST, ARCADIA, and CAPTIVA), NIH (PRECISE), and industry stroke trials (TIMELESS). Study aims are: 1) Continue as a leading RCC within StrokeNet through sustained high-volume recruitment and support and mentorship of our satellite sites. 2) Further study, develop, and implement standardized remote research capability throughout MHFV and StrokeNet in order to increase equitable access to clinical trials, promote diversity, and improve the generalizability of StrokeNet clinical trial results. 3) Leverage the resources of the UMN CTSI and School of Public Health and the StrokeNet to mentor exceptional physician scientists who will develop and conduct future stroke trials. In the next grant cycle, our RCC will remain a vital contributor to StrokeNet through continued high-volume recruitment, the further development, modernization and dissemination of best-practice clinical trial workflows, and strong commitment to educating the next generation of talented stroke physician-scientists."
10796251,"Project Summary. Cancer is governed by evolutionary principles whereby sequential changes at the genetic
and epigenetic level enable proliferation, immune evasion, drug resistance, and metastasis. An outstanding goal
in cancer biology is to understand the spatiotemporal processes underpinning this evolution. To do so would
greatly improve our ability to create more effective treatment strategies and forecast tumor development far into
the future. However, this goal remains elusive due to our incomplete catalog of molecular processes driving
evolution and lack of molecular and computational tools for holistically profiling tumors.
 One emerging driver is extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA). Found in approximately half of cancers and
strongly associated with poor survival, ecDNAs are a unique form of oncogene amplification: they reside outside
of chromosomes and exhibit elevated copy-number, gene expression, and chromatin accessibility as compared
to chromosomal amplifications. New evidence has underscored the importance of ecDNA dynamics and
heterogeneity in driving tumor progression: first, ecDNAs asymmetrically segregate during mitosis, leading to
accelerated copy-number gains and rapid adaptation to stressful conditions. Second, several varieties of
ecDNAs can exist in single cells where they form cooperative, intermolecular “hubs”. Despite this appreciation,
these features of ecDNA have remained elusive to study due to a scarcity of tools for profiling their vast
heterogeneity and stochastic evolutionary dynamics. In this project, I will develop the requisite computational
tools for profiling ecDNA variability and evolution in cancer and use these tools to more thoroughly investigate
how ecDNA heterogeneity is created, maintained, and leveraged in response to targeted therapies. First, I will
build on breakthroughs in long-read sequencing to develop tools that enable unbiased multi-omic profiling of
ecDNA variability across biological conditions (Aim 1). Second, I will leverage new molecular techniques to infer
the phylodynamic properties of ecDNA lineages and learn the molecular fitness landscape of ecDNA (Aim 2).
Third, I will explore the co-evolutionary principles of ecDNA by combining evolutionary modeling and CRISPR-
based screens (Aim 3). Together, these studies will illuminate properties of ecDNA evolution, nominate new
therapeutic strategies, and provide innovative computational tools for the greater scientific community.
 This work will be performed in the excellent training environment of Stanford University under the
mentorship of Dr. Howard Chang, an expert in epigenomics and ecDNA. An advisory committee of leaders in
the fields of ecDNA, cancer biology, bioinformatics, and tumor evolution will provide additional expertise and
mentorship. The first half of each aim will be completed predominantly during the K99 phase of the award,
providing a solid foundation for the aims in the R00 phase and eventually an independent R01 application."
10796252,"Abstract
Significant functional impairment of the hand is commonly observed following stroke. Robot-assisted training of
the hand can help stroke survivors practice complex multi-degrees-of-freedom movements of the hand, but it
remains mostly unknown how training conditions affects coordination patterns of the muscles producing hand
movements; such changes are critical in restoring hand function of stroke survivors after the training. The
overall hypothesis of this proposal is that the adaptation of the hand muscles during assisted training, even for
the same type of task, will be significantly affected by the assistance dynamics, sensory feedback, and task
condition.
The goal of this proposal is to examine the impact of the following three conditions of robot-assisted training on
the motor adaptation of the three hand muscle groups (extrinsic extensor, extrinsic flexor, and intrinsic
muscles) of stroke survivors. We will investigate: (1) whether two widely-used assistance mechanisms (end-
effector vs. exoskeleton) induce different patterns of changes in the extrinsic and intrinsic hand muscle
coordination; (2) if sensory modulation of distal and proximal finger joint movements results in different
changes in the muscle coordination; and (3) whether the dynamics of the task performed (static vs. dynamic)
affect these muscle groups differently when assisted.
The proposed study will elucidate the important, but currently not well-understood aspects of robot-assisted
training outcomes, i.e., how altered sensorimotor experience affects motor adaptation of stroke survivors at
their muscle level. We will use a novel robotic setup and virtual-reality technologies to alter sensorimotor
inputs/outputs associated with finger movements of stroke survivors. The results will provide vital information
regarding how the key aspects of robot-assisted training (assistance, feedback, and task dynamics) should be
designed to effectively restore impaired muscle coordination of the hand. In the long term, these outcomes will
lead to therapeutic approaches to restoring hand function of stroke survivors even after the training is
completed.

Goal-directed movements of the arms and hands are essential for many activities of daily living. Dysfunction of
the cortical areas controlling these behaviors is a common cause of disability. Basic neuroscience research on
the underlying circuits can help to identify pathophysiological mechanisms and ultimately inform treatments of
these disorders. Our prior progress has advanced basic knowledge about the synaptic circuit organization of the
forelimb-related primary motor cortex (M1) in the mouse, including local circuits, cortico-thalamo-cortical loops,
and input pathways from forelimb-related primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and other parietal areas. We now
propose to address a major remaining gap in knowledge: the cellular/synaptic basis for inter-areal
communication in premotor→motor pathways. These appear important for coordinating the functions associated
with premotor areas (e.g. motor planning) with those of primary motor areas (e.g. movement execution), in the
context of predicted and actual sensory feedback. Premotor→M1 axonal projections are anatomically prominent,
but the underlying corticocortical circuits are only partly characterized. Both M2 and S1 feed into M1, but the
behavioral functions of these afferent streams are profoundly different, with S1 conveying bottom-up
somatosensory information reporting ongoing changes in the sensory environment, and M2 providing top-down
signals related to action planning and sensorimotor prediction. We therefore hypothesize that the M2→M1
circuits and S1→M1 circuits are also asymmetrically implemented, reflecting the asymmetric behavior-related
computations they support. We speculate that M2→M1 circuits are configured through cell-type-specific
connections and synaptic dynamics to provide M2 with relatively more direct influence on M1 output neurons.
Using the mouse as model organism for genetically accessing specific cell types together with viral labeling
methods, we will apply electrophysiological and optogenetic methods to characterize circuits linking the forelimb-
related secondary motor cortex (M2; rostral forelimb area) to forelimb M1 (caudal forelimb area). Additionally,
we will investigate how top-down projections from M2 integrate in M1 with bottom-up inputs from S1. Our strategy
is two-pronged: in a series of slice-based experiments (Aim 1) we will use in vivo labeling methods combined
with ex vivo brain slice optogenetics and whole-cell recordings to characterize mono- and polysynaptic M2→M1
circuits. In a series of in vivo experiments (Aim 2), we will use linear-array electrophysiological recordings of
cortical spiking activity in the awake mouse, at rest and during natural forelimb movements, combined with
optogenetic manipulations of M2 input to assess in dynamics in M2→M1 circuits. Overall, we expect our findings
to be broadly significant for their relevance to current concepts about hierarchical cortical networks and
corticocortical signaling in general, as well as for advancing basic knowledge about motor cortex circuit

10930956,"ABSTRACT:
Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi’s) have emerged as important therapeutic agents targeting a
broadening class of gene mutations approved for treatment of breast, ovarian, prostate, and other cancers.
Genomic assays of BRCA-related genes and tumor homologous repair deficiency are used as companion
diagnostics for PARPi therapy but have imperfect predictive efficacy for PARPi response. Trevarx Biomedical
Inc.’s (Trevarx) product, [18F]Fluorthanatrace ([18F]FTT), a PET-radiolabeled analog of the PARPi, rucaparib,
provides quantitative images of regional PARP expression and drug engagement for all approved PARPi’s. It
can thus serve as a PARPi companion diagnostic to identify those most likely to respond to PARPi therapy, and
importantly, those unlikely to respond. Over 175 patients imaged in single center clinical trials support the
accuracy of [18F]FTT tumor uptake as an in-vivo measure of regional PARPi drug binding, and as an effective
imaging-based biomarker of PARP-1 protein levels. A pre-IND meeting with FDA suggested that approval would
require: (1) a Phase 3 tissue correlating [18F]FTT uptake and PARP-1 protein expression in tumor samples and
(2) multi-center Phase 2 studies of [18F]FTT’s accuracy in predicting PARPi response. A 3-center Phase 2 trial
PET-tissue comparison study has been initiated as a pilot for the larger Phase 3 trial, and striking new single-
center Phase 2 results on [18F]FTT predictive accuracy strongly support Phase 2 multi-center trials under
development. The focus of this proposal is to establish wide-spread radiopharmaceutical supply to support the
expanded multi-center trials needed for approval and subsequent clinical translation.
With a 3 year competitive lead, [18F]FTT is projected to enter a Phase 3 tracer-tissue trial and multi-center Phase
2 predictive efficacy trials to support an NDA in 2025. The steps described in this project will reduce the extended
timeline for FDA approval that has been observed with previous PET radiotracers. Building on the success of
our Phase I STTR project (1R41CA2612590-01), this STTR Phase II proposal by Trevarx and Penn will minimize
this timeline by establishing methods for unifying radiosynthesis, maximizing product consistency and production
yield, and generating a database to manage a larger supply chain for [18F]FTT. We aim to establish a new
paradigm for rapid commercialization of PET radiopharmaceuticals by providing a “best practice” template by
combining efforts in academic centers and commercial radiopharmaceutical supplier prior to Phase 3 to
efficiently bring a novel PET radiotracer to market. Our STTR Phase II proposal establishes a roadmap to move
from a single center academic trial to Phase 3 multi-center trials to efficient cGMP commercial production upon
NDA approval. In this revised application, we provide more details on [18F]FTT production ( i.e., synthesis kit
development and product formulation) and our strategy for the combined academic/commercial rollout of our
radiotracer to prepare for the Phase 3 multi-center clinical trial recommended by the FDA in our Pre-IND meeting."

Patients living with Type 1 Diabetes regulate their blood glucose through daily exogenous insulin
administration – the only other option towards a path to insulin independence is donor islets/whole organ
transplant, a limited resource, that replaces the cohort of cells that are lost in patients due to an autoimmune
attack. The success of these transplants is highly variable, with several patients requiring a second or
sometimes a third infusion of donor cells. Failure of allogeneic cell/tissue transplant often results from immune
activation within the host, and strong systemic immunosuppression is necessary for successful engraftment of
the transplant. Numerous approaches have been undertaken to alleviate the need for systemic
immunosuppression – those focused on manipulating the graft have genetically removed the expression of cell
surface proteins that, when mis-matched, lead to activation of the adaptive and innate immune systems. Such
cells are potentially invisible to the immune system and pose the grave problem of serving as potential
reservoirs of infection. If we had a method of identifying when a graft was experiencing inflammatory stress, we
could design acute anti-inflammatory therapies to protect the graft from the assault – prolonging the time it
takes for the graft to get accustomed to the niche and begin functioning. More recently, stem cells have
emerged as a limitless resource of cells as a surrogate to donor islets, and early clinical attempts are currently
underway. Replacement with stem cell derivatives circumvents the roadblock of limited transplant material –
they are still faced with immune activation due to an allo-response after transplantation.
Our goal is to address these challenges using state-of-the-art technologies we have pioneered. Combining the
potential of stem cell therapy with an intracellular biosensing system that provides real time feedback in
response to the transplantation niche, we will leapfrog allogeneic cell transplantation into the future – such a
detection system can measure viability of grafts that can be predictive of successful engraftment and help
define interventions to protect cells against inflammatory stress soon after transplantation. We have
engineered nanoprobes that bind and respond to changes in miRNA levels and serve as intracellular sensors
for cell health. Our nanoprobes are specific, sensitive, and can be detected in vivo in animal models.
Here, we test our lead inflammation-sensitive biosensor in stem cell-derived insulin producing organoids – this
combination can provide unique spectral read outs, in vitro and in small animal models, that result from a
specific inflammatory response triggered in the cells, de-risking our final cell therapy product that will become
part of a functional cure for patients living with type 1 diabetes."
10821944,"SPIRIT Club’s current virtual platform and programming provides a variety of levels and types of supportive
fitness classes to 230+ organizations in three different countries with an average of 5,000 consumers daily.
SPIRIT Club’s long-term goal is to expand the current platform and programming to target the specific needs of
various sub-populations, especially those transitioning from formal rehabilitation settings to their long-term
home environments. With this Fast-Track application, the technical components of the SPIRIT Club platform
will be enhanced to include an on-demand, evidence-based and stakeholder-informed chronic brain injury
(CBI) Pathway. Mainstream physical fitness centers and online exercise programs often lack accessibility and
training to support people with long-term cognitive and physical impairments common after acquired brain
injuries. Goal: In Phase 1, we will leverage our existing fitness platform designed for individuals with
intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD) to build an on-demand evidence-based and stakeholder
informed pathway that includes programming and educational material for adolescents and adults living with
persistent cognitive and physical impairments associated with a CBI. In Phase II, we will test, refine, and
evaluate the utility of the new pathway for individuals with CBI in real-world contexts to improve outcomes and
increase the commercialization of SPIRIT Club. Approach: Our team is composed of industry, clinical, and
research experts in the areas of physical fitness and rehabilitation programming for people with disabilities to
ensure the CBI pathway will be innovative, evidence-based, feasible, and patient- and family-centered. Aims:
Phase I: Design a user-friendly expansion of the SPIRIT Club platform to provide a targeted set of educational
modules and exercise programming that specifically meets the needs of CBI survivors and their caregivers.
Aim 1.1: Adapt and enhance SPIRIT Club features to include stakeholder-informed content and curriculum for
SPIRIT Club members with CBI through a formative evaluation process using a community-based participatory
action approach with clinical experts and patient and caregiver advisors. Aim 1.2: Build and test the technical
components for the CBI Pathway into SPIRIT Club’s existing platform. Milestone to progress to Phase II:
Operational prototype of the CBI pathway on SPIRIT Club’s virtual platform. Phase II: Evaluate the utility of the
new platform to promote physical activity and wellness among CBI survivors. Aim 2.1: Conduct a pilot test of
the prototype with 10 CBI survivors, and refine the prototype based on findings. Aim 2.2: Evaluate the utility of
SPIRIT Club’s CBI Pathway for promoting physical activity engagement and self-efficacy using a randomized
control trial."
10932285,"Project Abstract
Alcohol use among women has substantially and concerningly increased over the last decade, relative to
smaller increases among men. While drinking is strongly associated with significant health risks in both sexes,
females have exacerbated alcohol-related health consequences when compared to males. Compounding this
issue, treatment development for alcohol use has not considered, nor is responsive to known sex differences in
alcohol use. For these reasons, the field requires an increased capacity to conduct translational science to
study sex and gender differences in relation to alcohol use. This R13 proposal is a request for funding for a bi-
annual (once every two years), one-day satellite meeting held at the site of the Research Society on Alcohol
conference to focus on translational innovations in sex and gender differences in alcohol use. This meeting
would serve several key functions: 1) To serve as a hub for an international group of scientists, clinicians, and
trainees to support the exchange of ideas and promote new collaborations on sex/gender and alcohol use
spanning T1 to T4 translation. 2) To foster the development of the next generation of translational alcohol
researchers, by supporting 25 travel awards to graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and early-career junior
faculty to present their research. 3) To provide information on best practice procedures and definitional
parameters relevant to the study of sex/gender and alcohol. An interactive program would feature both leading
international speakers and trainees, maximizing diversity and inclusion. This proposed R13 grant will provide a
unique contribution to NIAAA’s mission to incorporate sex and gender “into the design, analysis, and scientific
reporting of the studies it funds. This is a critical step toward ensuring that everyone, regardless of sex or
gender, benefits from alcohol research advances”32."
10823041,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a chronic debilitating condition characterized by limb swelling, discomfort,
hyperpigmentation, skin ulcers, and impaired quality of life. Within 2 years of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
treatment, 50-60% of patients with iliofemoral thrombosis and 30-50% of all DVT patients regardless of
thrombosis location experience PTS (1). Catheter-based therapies to remove the obstructive thrombus have
fared no better in clinical trials (e.g. ATTRACT, CaVenT and CAVA) than anti-coagulant therapy alone in
preventing PTS onset. In the NHLBI/NIH-funded ATTRACT randomized trial, for example, catheter-based
thrombolysis with or without thrombectomy did not reduce the incidence of PTS vs. control anticoagulation alone.
In subgroup analysis, catheter-based thrombus removal conferred reduced moderate-to-severe PTS in more
proximal (iliofemoral) DVT (2,3), but no benefit in either iliofemoral veins when treatment was administered later
than 8 days post-symptom onset (4) nor in more distal (femoropopliteal) disease regardless of timing (5).
There remains a clear unmet need in the treatment of DVT, because catheter technologies that clear the
thrombus burden do nothing to treat the underlying vascular inflammation that (a) led to the DVT formation in
the first place, and (b) resulted from the thrombus organization and resolution process. Left untreated,
inflammation lays down a thick collagen layer causing fibrotic vein wall stiffening, damaged venous valves,
reduced venous compliance, and venous insufficiency (6,7). Preventing this scar-like process from damaging
the vein and leading to PTS is the central goal of this project.
In response to the inflammatory hypothesis, a field of research has emerged to fight venous inflammation and
reverse the course of DVT progression toward PTS (8-13), but systemic drug therapies aimed at specific
inflammatory targets have proven ineffective (14). It has now been shown through the Phase I research
phase of this project that locally delivered anti-inflammatory (dexamethasone) therapy is an effective
means of blocking collagen deposition and reducing thrombus burden in a mouse model.
In tandem with the Phase I STTR preclinical research, Mercator MedSystems has launched an open-label clinical
trial to determine the effect of local dexamethasone delivery to perivascular tissues surrounding veins undergoing
DVT recanalization, with positive results in comparison to historical data from the ATTRACT trial. Based on the
Phase I preclinical research and the clinical data to date, the Phase II aims are proposed with confidence.
In this Phase II SBIR proposal, we will enroll a 60-patient, dual-blinded, randomized controlled trial
(Specific Aim 1) and follow primary and secondary safety and efficacy signals (Specific Aim 2) in acute
DVT to determine the ability for perivenous dexamethasone therapy to improve outcomes between the
two groups. Subsequent Phase 3 clinical trials will be powered based on the signals seen in this Phase
2 trial."
10784489,"This proposed Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award will support Dr. Lachant’s
advancement as a physician-scientist equipped to conduct independent research which sensibly utilizes
emerging wearable technology and rehabilitation strategies to improve the lives of patients with heart and lung
disease. The research project itself will study the impact of an electronically-delivered rehabilitation program
early after hospitalization for acute pulmonary embolism. The proposed research study will build on a
foundation of didactic coursework and provide an opportunity for mentored development in clinical trial design
and execution. A key training goal will be to develop and automate analysis of novel end points using
wearable technology (heart rate and activity); he will also gain expertise in biostatistics, management and
analysis of massive data sets, and the role of exercise in disease. Completion of this award will allow Dr.
Lachant to become an independent researcher performing decentralized clinical trials incorporating wearable
devices in pulmonary vascular disease towards the goal of delivering optimal home rehabilitation programs.
Residual dyspnea (Post-PE Syndrome) is common (~50%) after acute PE and is associated with increased
morbidity and healthcare utilization. Exercise after acute pulmonary embolism is generally recommended in
the 2019 European Society of Cardiology guidelines without any details (appropriate location, degree of
intensity, type of monitoring). Dr. Lachant’s hypothesis is that an early rehabilitation program incorporating
heart rate monitoring will reduce post PE syndrome by addressing deconditioning and anxiety, two factors
associated with Post-PE syndrome. To test this hypothesis, Dr. Lachant will enroll patients hospitalized with
acute pulmonary embolism into an electronically-delivered rehabilitation program within seven days of
discharge. We will evaluate whether a prescriptive exercise program which gradually intensifies over 8 weeks
is better than regular electronic contact to decrease Post-PE syndrome. Since Post-PE syndrome does not
have a diagnostic test, he will evaluate multiple parameters as surrogates for Post-PE syndrome, including an
end point combining a change in activity with a reduction in PEmb quality of life questionnaires (Aim 1). The
optimal activity tracker wear time and exercise compliance will also be evaluated (Aim 2). We will be
intentionally inclusive in our recruitment and seek to determine whether sex, race/ethnicity, or socioeconomic
factors associate with outcomes or participation. The study results will provide invaluable data for Dr. Lachant
to design a multicenter, prospective study implementing a decentralized, home-based rehabilitation after
hospitalized acute PE. His project mentors are experts in exercise and rehabilitation (Karen Mustian, Ph.D,
MPH) and pulmonary vascular disease (R. James White, MD, Ph.D); experts in pulmonary embolism clinical
trials (Jeffrey Kline, MD) and Biomedical Engineering (Jean Pierre Couderc Ph.D) will assist with key training
goals. This accomplished mentor team will help support his launch as an independent investigator."
10820618,"The overall aim of this project is to develop a commercial device for acquiring electrically evoked
auditory brainstem responses (eeABR) using direct promontory stimulation for the assessment of 8th
nerve function for the determination of cochlear implantation candidacy. The proposed device will be
compact and portable using an innovative amplifier hardware design to overcome the limitations of
currently available evoked potential systems. New stimulation and data processing strategies will be
developed in order to facilitate the extraction of eeABRs.
 As of 2019, more than 736,900 patients have received cochlear implants (CI) worldwide. It is
important to assess the functional status of the cochlea and 8th nerve prior to implant surgery. There is
currently no commercially available device for this purpose. As such, in difficult to assess cases,
physicians have had to use standard evoked potential systems with prototype or rudimentary electrical
stimulation units in order to make the necessary assessments of implantation candidacy. These pieced
together configurations are most often fraught with noise problems and/or shortcomings. The present
proposal will develop an effective eeABR testing device using bio-amplifiers with hardware blanking and
fast recovery circuitry, integrated electrical stimulation circuitry, innovative stimulation techniques, and
associated shielded disposable stimulation and recording electrodes. During Phase I, the effectiveness of
the proposed device will be tested via animal experiments."

The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) eating pattern has been shown to reduce systolic and
diastolic blood pressure by clinically meaningful levels (10.7 and 4.7 mm Hg, respectively) among adults with
hypertension. Accordingly, national treatment guidelines recommend the DASH as a first-line treatment for the
116 million US adults with hypertension. However, DASH adherence among U.S. adults with hypertension
remains exceedingly low. A major barrier to DASH uptake is poor accessibility to and high cost of healthful
foods. Approximately 38% of U.S. census tracts have limited access to high-quality foods; these communities
generally lack supermarkets or large grocery stores, which facilitate both availability and affordable food
pricing. Healthful food access is especially constrained in lower-income and predominately racial/ethnic
minority neighborhoods. To best address the considerable population health challenge of hypertension, we
need innovative approaches to expand equitable access to the DASH eating pattern. Members of our team are
currently conducting Nourish (R01HL146768), a digital behavioral health intervention delivered via a
smartphone application (app), to improve adherence to DASH among adults with hypertension. The
intervention components include DASH education and skills training, self-monitoring, personalized feedback,
goal setting, and responsive health coaching. We expect that the Nourish intervention, if successful, can be
scaled and disseminated to millions of adults. However, access challenges remain; without additional
intervention, a large proportion of U.S. adults will still have limited access to high-quality foods--a critical barrier
to adopting the DASH eating pattern. In the current proposal, we will leverage the rapidly mounting availability
of grocery delivery services to deliver Access Nourish, an intervention that will provide tailored grocery lists and
at-home grocery delivery options through a commercially available smartphone app. We will test the feasibility
of Access Nourish among n=65 patients with hypertension living in low access census tracts, as defined by the
USDA. We will deliver Access Nourish in addition to the existing intervention components of Nourish,
described above, to provide a comprehensive intervention package that targets behavioral mechanisms to
increase DASH adherence and improves food access. Feasibility will be assessed via participant accrual;
participant retention; and other indicators of feasibility, including acceptability, demand, implementation,
practicality, and adaptation of the intervention. We will also conduct qualitative interviews to elicit barriers and
facilitators to using an online grocery delivery app. We believe this approach will yield meaningful information
regarding the utility of these tools in improving access and adherence to effective hypertension management
interventions. Subject to future efficacy testing, this intervention can be scaled to enhance dietary interventions
that are needed by millions of Americans who lack access to high-quality food, yet require dietary modifications
to control their high blood pressure and related comorbidities."

Background: Black sexual and gender minorities (SGM) are disproportionately affected by HIV and existing
disparities could be exacerbated by increases in substance use disorders, as shifting trends in the opioid
epidemic have been accompanied by increases in methamphetamine and polysubstance use among Black
SGM. Evidence suggests that factors such as housing instability, incarceration, and unemployment may pose
significant barriers to engagement in HIV prevention and care for Black SGM, and these factors are also
associated with methamphetamine use. Because such interventions are resource intensive and logistically
challenging, particularly for vulnerable communities who are often highly mobile and less likely to engage in
research in traditional settings, guidance is needed at the intervention development stage to determine the
most impactful and efficient intervention strategies. Agent-based models (ABMs) can be used to virtually
evaluate candidate interventions to facilitate more efficient and timely intervention development. Because they
allow for the conduct of counterfactual experiments, ABMs can also facilitate identification of effects that would
be difficult to identify using traditional statistical approaches and can provide valuable insights to understand
causal mechanisms that give rise to complex systems. Objective: Building on an existing ABM platform, this
proposal will utilize multiple existing data sources to characterize relationships among socio-structural
stressors, substance use, mental health, and HIV prevention and care continuum outcomes among Black
SGM. We will combine methods from epidemiology, ABM, and robust decision making (RDM) to understand
the potential impact of structural interventions for reducing substance use, overdose, and HIV transmission.
Methods: We will apply statistical and computational methods to better understand how socio-structural
factors, substance use, and mental health impact engagement in HIV prevention and care continuums. We will
then conduct a series of experiments to evaluate how socio-structural factors impact the uptake of existing
biomedical interventions and compare outcomes under scenarios with different combinations of interventions
using RDM. Significance: A better understanding of where and how to focus intervention efforts offers
potential to improve substance use and HIV prevention and care outcomes for Black SGM. Once developed,
our methods and models can be adapted to other geographic areas to reflect local prevention priorities and
can serve as an example application of epidemiology, ABM, and RDM methods to advance HIV and substance
use prevention science."
10789129,"The present application is submitted to renew the Research Career Scientist (RCS) status of the incumbent in
order to continue and expand his urological research that has strong relevance to the Veterans health, provide
important services to the local and national VA, mentor the next-generation urological researchers and
enhance the interdisciplinary collaborations of the RCS with investigators at the VA, academic affiliate and
urological community at large. The renewal proposal is built upon the significant accomplishments the RCS
has made during the last award cycle in all the aforementioned areas. On the scientific front, the RCS led his
colleagues in re-defining the in vivo effects of the loss of tumor suppressors located at chromosome 9p21.3 on
bladder tumor formation. Instead of the conventionally suspected loss of CDKN2A and ARF tumor
suppressors, it is the loss of commonly neglected CDKN2B that triggers the tumor initiation of low-grade, non-
invasive bladder cancer which accounts for 70-80% of all bladder cancers. Multiple lines of evidence from
bladder tumor cell lines, genetic engineered mice and human specimens showed that the loss of CDKN2B
markedly accelerates cell-cycle progression and releases the inhibition of CDKN2B on alpha enolase, an
enzyme critical for aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect). Structural work further demonstrates that the divergent
amino acid sequences between CDKN2B and CDKN2A underlie their functional differences, making the former
a significantly stronger tumor suppressor than the latter. These paradigm-changing findings have major
implications on a new combinatorial biomarker set for accurately diagnosing and predicting the progression
and preventing the recurrence of superficial papillary bladder tumors. On another notable series of studies, the
RCS and colleagues found that, while the isoform 2 of pyruvate kinase (PKM2), which is universally
overexpressed in bladder cancers, is not involved in bladder cancer initiation, it is indispensable for bladder
growth and maintenance. PKM2 binds STAT3, and transcriptionally activates angiogenic factor HIF1alpha, and
promotes non-oncogenic metabolic addiction. Taken together, the metabolic reprogramming through the
upregulation of alpha enalose and PKM2 is crucial for bladder tumor initiation and progression, respectively,
and inhibition of both glycolytic enzymes should be of significant values in controlling bladder cancers. The
RCS and his collaborators at the VA and academic institutions have continued to deepen their understanding
of the physiological functions and disease involvement of Tamm-Horsfall protein (uromodulin), the most
abundant protein in human urine, in kidney stone formation, urinary tract infection, acute kidney injury and
chronic kidney disease. They are actively embarking on the in vivo effects of the rare and common variants of
uromodulin on monogenic and polygenic disorders using cutting-edge mouse modeling techniques. Over the
last four and a half years, the RCS successfully renewed a multidisciplinary NIH/NCI Program Project (PO1)
grant, obtained a new collaborative VA Merit Award, and an NIH/NIDDK RO1 grant; published 30 peer-
reviewed papers, many in high-impact journals; spearheaded multiple collaborative projects with VA and non-
VA investigators; continued to actively train junior and mid-career faculty members and postdoctoral fellows;
and provided important services to local and national VA, university affiliates and research community at large.
These accomplishments set the stage for the RCS to continue and expand his contributions to the mission of
VA and university affiliate in helping advance research, education, patient care, mentoring, services and
interdisciplinary collaborations."
10789614,"Project Summary
 More than 10% of the global adult population currently lives with diabetes mellitus (DM) and are
experiencing or at higher risk for various diabetic vasculopathies such as peripheral artery disease (PAD).
Despite available treatment, many patients with DM continue to develop diabetic vasculopathy, highlighting the
urgent need for more effective therapies. Mounting research has shown that the dysfunction of endothelial cells
(ECs), known as endotheliopathy, plays a crucial role in the onset of DM and its vasculopathies. However, there
is still a gap in knowledge regarding the epigenetic regulators that drive endotheliopathy in DM and cause
persistent vascular damage, and whether these regulators can be targeted for treatment.
 Synergizing efforts from our funded studies on long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)-regulated EC function
(R01HL145170) and diabetic epigenetic memory (R01HL106089), my group has uncovered important roles of
non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs and lncRNAs, in endotheliopathy, vascular inflammation, and impaired
vascular regeneration in DM and diabetic PAD. Furthermore, we identified chromatin-associated lncRNAs as
key mediators of metabolic memory, which may explain the persistent vascular damage observed in patients
with DM, even after restoration of normoglycemia. We have also broken new ground to unravel the role of the
N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-modified epitranscriptome in DM-induced endotheliopathy and to harness
nanoparticles and modified RNA to develop therapeutics that target the dysfunctional EC epigenome.
 In this R35 application, our overall vision is that elucidating the RNA-mediated epigenetic and
epitranscriptional mechanisms underlying DM-associated endotheliopathy in depth will enable us to develop
novel therapeutics to ameliorate diabetic vasculopathy. Our proposed studies will bring together expertise in
RNA, chromatin, and endothelial biology; gene therapy; and nanomedicine to address this pressing medical
issue. We will achieve our goals through three independent yet inter-connected projects to: 1) identify the roles
and mechanisms of action of novel lncRNA regulators in driving endotheliopathy and diabetic vasculopathy; 2)
determine the role of m6A RNA modification in diabetic endotheliopathy and vasculopathy; and 3) evaluate the
efficacy of innovative nanoparticle-mediated epigenetic therapeutics in ameliorating diabetic vasculopathy, with
a focus on PAD, a painful disease with limited treatment options. The unique R35 Emerging Investigator Award
mechanism will allow me to further my group’s research on RNA-mediated endotheliopathy by testing new
hypotheses using innovative technologies. Aligned with the NHLBI mission, our proposed studies will advance
our understanding of diabetic vasculopathy and have the potential to facilitate the development of much-needed
new therapies for patients with diabetic vasculopathy."
10789801,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is the most common symptom associated with cancer and its treatments.
Moderate to severe CRF has a negative impact on patients' ability to tolerate treatments as well as on their
quality of life. In some patients, CRF is so severe, that they discontinue cancer treatment. Given its high
occurrence and significant negative impact, it is imperative that effective treatments be developed for this
devastating symptom. Two of the major knowledge gaps for CRF are a lack of a risk prediction model and a
lack of knowledge of its underlying mechanisms. A sensitive and specific risk prediction model would assist
clinicians to determine which patients are most likely to experience high levels of CRF and provide
recommendations regarding activity modifying interventions (e.g., exercise). Increased knowledge of the
mechanisms for CRF could identify potential targets for therapeutic interventions. Both of these knowledge
gaps will be addressed in this application. Prior studies suggest that patients will experience an increase in the
severity of CRF in the weeks following concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy (CCRT) that can persist
after completion of treatment. However, no models exist to predict the magnitude of this increase. This inability
to predict the severity of CRF during and following CCRT limits the ability of clinicians to identify high-risk
patients and provide them with recommendations to manage CRF. To address this knowledge gap,
demographic, clinical, and molecular data that are collected prior to the initiation of CCRT will be used to
evaluate the utility of these features to predict the severity of CRF midway through, at the completion of, and
six months following the completion of CCRT. In terms of mechanisms of CRF, while previous studies provide
some insights into potential mechanisms that underlie CRF, several limitations warrant consideration,
including: poorly defined CRF phenotype; relatively small sample sizes; evaluation of patients receiving only
CTX or only RT; evaluation of a single type of molecular data; and evaluation of only cross-sectional molecular
data. To address these limitations, we propose to evaluate for associations between changes in CRF and
changes in gene expression and circulating cytokines in patients receiving CCRT over two time points (i.e.,
prior to and at the completion of treatment). This study will provide new insights to be able to identify high-risk
patients as well as identify potential therapeutic targets. This project will guide the development of clinical
studies to investigate additional mechanisms and therapeutic interventions for CRF and other types of fatigue
associated with cancer and its treatment (e.g., immunotherapy, surgery)."

Neuronal plasticity allows neurons to change the strength of their connections with each other and even to
make or break connections. Plasticity is a fundamental property of neurons that underlies numerous brain
functions such as learning and probably sleep, but it is also misregulated in diseases such as autism. Making
stable changes in neuronal connections requires transcription and translation and an activity-dependent gene
expression program is rapidly induced in response to neuronal activity. Many of the genes in this first wave of
gene expression encode transcription factors that then regulate additional genes that are more directly
involved in plasticity. Mutations in components of these activity-dependent programs have been associated
with human cognitive disorders and psychiatric diseases, showing the importance of this pathway.
We study plasticity in s-LNvs, the principal Drosophila circadian pacemaker neurons, which are ideal since
changes in the morphology of their projections are predictable and happen at defined times each day. Having
only 4 s-LNvs per brain hemisphere makes their projections easy to visualize, and we have the tools of
Drosophila genetics to alter gene expression or neuronal activity in s-LNvs, along with expression profiles. s-
LNv structural changes are driven by neuronal activity: their projections expand at dawn when s-LNvs are most
excitable, and retract around dusk when s-LNvs become hyperpolarized. s-LNvs use activity-dependent gene
expression to expand projections, ultimately activating Rac1 GTPase to regulate actin. We have identified a
second transcriptional program that is activated by neuronal hyperpolarization and/or neuronal inactivity. This
program opposes activity-dependent gene expression and leads to Rho1 GTPase activation to retract s-LNv
projections. Just like activity-dependent gene expression, the first step in hyperpolarization-dependent gene
expression is to transcribe a gene encoding a transcription factor – in this case Toy, a fly Pax6 orthologue.
In Goal 1, we propose to understand the molecular mechanism of hyperpolarization-dependent gene
expression in s-LNvs, and test if this program functions in mammals. We will also test if hyperpolarization-
dependent gene expression is important in sleep, which is associated with overall synaptic downscaling. In
Goal 2, we will study competition between the activity-dependent and hyperpolarization-dependent gene
expression programs that likely works both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally to ensure one program
dominates. In Goal 3, we will develop a genomic-based approach to identify connections between neurons that
we predict will be broadly applicable, and also to give insights into how new connections are specified at the
molecular level. Overall, studying plasticity in s-LNvs should give a holistic view of plasticity that is broadly
relevant across neurobiology and could identify new disease risk loci."

expression in s-LNvs, and test if this program functions in mammals. We will also test if hyperpolarization-
dependent gene expression is important in sleep, which is associated with overall synaptic downscaling. In
Goal 2, we will study competition between the activity-dependent and hyperpolarization-dependent gene
expression programs that likely works both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally to ensure one program
dominates. In Goal 3, we will develop a genomic-based approach to identify connections between neurons that
we predict will be broadly applicable, and also to give insights into how new connections are specified at the
molecular level. Overall, studying plasticity in s-LNvs should give a holistic view of plasticity that is broadly
relevant across neurobiology and could identify new disease risk loci."

Endotracheal intubation is a common hospital procedure implemented in patients requiring mechanical
ventilation. However, biofilms formed on endotracheal tubes (ETTs) represent a leading cause of ventilator-
associated pneumonia (VAP). VAP affects up to 28% of intubated patients and carries a 13% overall mortality.
Efforts to prevent VAP have included systemic antibiotics and silver-coated ETTs. However, systemic
antibiotics are reported to have little effect on biofilm formation on ETTs. Although silver‐coated ETTs have
been shown to reduce the VAP rate effectively, these tubes have a major limitation in being economically
feasible. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop new strategies that can effectively eradicate biofilms on
ETTs and are also cost-effective. The objective of this R21 application is to explore the utility of a novel
optical endotracheal tube (Optical-ETT), which can be activated by antimicrobial blue light (aBL; 405 nm)
and subsequently emit aBL uniformly from the ETT surface, to combat biofilms on ETTs. Our team is a pioneer
in the field of aBL. Our central hypothesis is that Optical-ETT can effectively prevent biofilm formation and
eradicate preexisting biofilm on the ETT. To address this hypothesis, we propose two Specific Aims.
In Aim 1, we will conduct in vitro studies to determine the anti-biofilm efficacy of Optical-ETT. Biofilms will be
formed on ETT segments in the growth medium. To prevent biofilm formation on ETTs, Optical-ETTs will be
""activated"" by aBL within 3 h after bacterial inoculation. To eradicate preexisting biofilms on ETTs, Optical-
ETTs will be ""activated"" by aBL 24, 48, and 96 h after bacterial inoculation when biofilms of different stages
have formed. The efficacy found with Optical-ETTs will be compared with that of silver-coated ETTs.
In Aim 2, we will determine the anti-biofilm efficacy and safety of Optical-ETT in vivo using a swine model of
endotracheal intubation. Animals will be challenged by instilling bacterial suspensions (5 mL at 108 CFU/mL)
into the buccal pouch 30 min after intubation. To prevent biofilm formation on ETTs, Optical-ETTs will be
activated by aBL within 3 h after bacterial challenge. To eradicate preexisting biofilms on ETTs, the activation
of Optical-ETTs by aBL will be delayed until 24 h after bacterial challenge when mature biofilms have formed.
The bacterial loads of ETTs, the tracheas, and the lungs will be quantified. To evaluate the safety of Optical-
ETT, the tracheal tissue damages will be assessed using histology. The potential inflammatory response
triggered by Optical-ETT will be analyzed by measuring the proinflammatory cytokine profile in the
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Additionally, the effect of Optical-ETT on the ciliary motion will be evaluated using
micro-optical coherence tomography, a unique imaging technology invented in our department.
The most important impact of this application resides in the opening of a branch of study on the novel aBL-
activatable Optical-ETT to combat biofilms on ETTs. Successful completion of the Specific Aims in this
application will provide initial preclinical evidence to determine the effectiveness and safety of the Optical-ETT."

 The tumor suppressor gene, p53, has pleiotropic functions that quash tumor development.
One of its most important functions is to prevent the genome from sustaining DNA damage in
order to prevent the propagation of genetic lesions into daughter cells. Given the high degree of
genetic alterations in cancer, it is not surprising that p53 is frequently inactivated. The most
common form of genetic lesions in the p53 gene are point mutations in the DNA binding domain.
These missense mutations typically inactivate the p53’s tumor suppressor activity while
simultaneously generating an oncogenic protein. The presence of mutant p53 correlates with
increased chromosomal instability leading to loss of tumor suppressor genes and amplification of
oncogenes. It has become increasingly recognized that the cGAS/STING/TBK1/IRF3 innate
immune response signaling pathway plays a crucial role in detecting genetic alterations and
launching cell intrinsic and extrinsic responses to suppress aberrant cells that harbor genetic
defects. In this proposal, we that mutant p53 suppresses signaling through the cGAS/STING
pathway and thereby dictates how cells respond to its activation. We propose three aims to
determine the mechanism by which mutant p53 controls cGAS/STING signaling, and the cell
intrinsic and extrinsic consequences of modulation of this pathway. The completion of these
studies will help guide how to therapeutically approach cancers based on their p53 status."
10791757,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Survivors of childhood, adolescent, and young adult (AYA) cancer have an elevated risk of subsequent
malignant neoplasms which are associated with morbidity and premature mortality. Emerging evidence
suggests that colorectal cancer (CRC), associated with abdominal or pelvic radiotherapy used to treat the
childhood or AYA cancer, is one such neoplasm. Early studies indicate other treatment exposures, including
cisplatin and alkylator therapy, may also be associated with CRC risk and may interact with the radiotherapy to
confer a markedly elevated risk. Knowledge of whether age at exposure to these therapies might modify risk is
limited. Further, prognosis after a treatment-related CRC is not well-understood. These gaps in knowledge are
due to the limited number of CRCs in any single cohort, lack of detailed information on primary cancer
treatments for some cohorts, the relatively young age of cohorts, and the focus of existing cohorts on either
childhood cancer survivors or on survivors of specific young adult cancers.
 We propose to leverage the unique resources of eight international childhood and AYA cancer survivor
cohorts. We will pool individual participant data on 51,309 survivors, 298 with CRC, and with median follow-up
across studies ranging from 13 to 26 years after primary cancer diagnosis, to comprehensively examine risk
factors of, and mortality after, subsequent CRCs. This is almost four-fold the number of CRCs in any known
childhood or AYA cohort with detailed treatment data available. Thus, the combination of childhood and AYA
cancer survivors into a single cohort is novel and given common treatment approaches to pediatric and AYA
cancer, will enable us to address these questions with the ability to assess the role of age at exposure.
 The primary aim of this project is to evaluate the association of childhood and AYA cancer therapy
(abdominal and/or pelvic radiation fields and dose, as well as chemotherapy exposures including cumulative
doses of alkylating agents, anthracyclines, platinating agents) on CRC risk in a large, multi-cohort, international
survivor population. Secondary aims will focus on conducting an expanded assessment of the burden of CRC
in childhood and AYA cancer survivors. This includes estimating and comparing the incidence of CRC in
childhood and AYA cancer survivors to the incidence of CRC in the general population, as well as
characterizing mortality following a CRC diagnosis in childhood and AYA cancer survivors and comparing it to
that observed following a de novo CRC diagnosis in the general population.
 The results from this work have the potential to help refine screening guidelines and strategies for
preventing CRC. In addition, in achieving our aims, we will establish a resource that may be leveraged for
future investigator-initiated research."

This project will develop a new mouse model to improve chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell cancer
immunotherapy for malignant brain tumors. CAR T cells are patient derived T cells that are genetically modified
with a CAR to allow them to recognize and destroy malignant target cells. CAR T therapy has shown impressive
results against leukemia and lymphoma, but has not yet been as successful in clinical trials for brain tumors.
Although CAR T cells can kill brain tumor cells successfully in vitro and in mouse models, they have much more
limited ability to find the tumor and survive in the hostile tumor microenvironment when given to patients either
intravenously or into the cerebrospinal fluid that surrounds the brain.
 Our mouse model allows the following innovations which we believe are key to approaching the situation
in real patients: an immunocompetent mouse model which receives CAR T cells made from the same species,
and which develops tumors that are intrinsic to the brain, as opposed to being implanted. We will focus on high
grade gliomas, which continue to be the brain tumors killing the largest number of children and adults. We will
optimize the tumor growth parameters to allow us to image the tumor and infiltrating CAR T and other immune
cells through a skull window with advanced two-photon in vivo microscopy at a cellular and subcellular resolution.
 Aim 1: Develop a high grade glioma tumor model optimized for in vivo imaging. The goal is to induce high
grade gliomas quickly and efficiently, but allow enough time to image the brain over at least 10 days through a
cranial window before the tumors start causing symptoms. We will deliver oncogenic transgenes into the brain
via an avian virus (RCAS), which can only infect cells that are transgenic for the TVA receptor. We will express
the TVA receptor in our mice under the control of the nestin promoter, which is active in neuroglial progenitor
cells. Our mice are also deficient in Cdkn2a, which makes them more susceptible to tumor induction.
 Aim 2: Test efficiency of different CAR T cell delivery routes. We will use in vivo two photon brain imaging,
histology and flow cytometry to test how well CAR T cells can traffic to brain tumors when given either
intravenously, directly into the tumor, or into the cerebrospinal fluid.
 Aim 3: Test whether activation of CAR T cells in the blood enhances trafficking to brain tumors. Using
the tumor model optimized in Aim 1, we will express two different CAR targets in the gliomas: either a murine or
a human truncated CD19. CAR T cells directed against the murine CD19 also recognize the mouse’s normal B
cells, which we hypothesize will activate them and increase their ability to travel throughout the body and find
the tumors in the brain. CAR T cells targeting the human CD19 will lack this extra stimulation.
 This work is innovative because it develops more challenging but more naturalistic immunocompetent
mouse models for studying CAR T cell trafficking into brain tumors. Our team combines expertise in brain tumor
modeling, in vivo neuroimaging in mice, and clinical trials of brain tumor CAR T cell therapy."

The United States does not have sufficient science to mount an evidence-based response to combat the health
detriments of present-day anti-Asian American (AA) hate. AA parents and children are struggling with a deeply
troubling new sociopolitical context, a context with unprecedented levels of anti-Asian hate and violence fueled
by references to COVID-19 as the “China virus.” Physical assaults against AAs skyrocketed by 145% in 2020
and have spiked to 164% in the first quarter of 2021. Among AA youth, 80% report being bullied or verbally
harassed and 24% reported being shunned. Our evidence base for how racism impacts AA mental health
under “normal” circumstances is insufficient and woefully inadequate. This R01 fills a critical gap in the science
of how discrimination affects AA adolescent mental health, how adolescents respond to racial discrimination,
and the agents involved in racial socialization processes involving AA adolescents. There are no longitudinal
studies that investigate the effects of racial discrimination on AA adolescent mental health while also
incorporating novel observational methods to determine how parents, peers, and social media are racial
socializing AA adolescents. This project will follow 350 Chinese American adolescents (12-15 years), their
Chinese heritage parent, and a peer to investigate the effects of discrimination experiences, discrimination
responses, and racial socialization processes on adolescent mental health (depression, anxiety, suicidality)
and on chronic stress (hair cortisol) over three timepoints. The long-term objective is to develop a biomedical
evidence base focused on how parents, peers and social media can be leveraged to mitigate the negative
health consequences of discrimination. Our multi-method approach (observation, survey, interview, biomarker)
investigates the following aims: Aim 1. To assess how racial discrimination is associated with Chinese
American adolescent (a) mental health (depression, anxiety, suicidality) and (b) biomarkers of chronic stress
(hair cortisol) over three years. Aim 2. To determine how adolescent characteristics (internalization of the
model minority myth, ethnic identity) moderate the association between discrimination and mental
health/chronic stress. Aim 3. To (a) understand how parent characteristics (racial socialization, mental health,
ethnic identity), moderate the association between adolescent discrimination and adolescent mental
health/chronic stress (hair cortisol). We also consider “upwards socialization”; how adolescents are active
agents in their own socialization and the socialization of those around them. Discrimination during adolescence
has especially pernicious effects on concurrent and downstream adult health and understanding AA
adolescent discrimination will help identify those at risk for problematic mental health. This study will inform
urgently needed individual-, family- and peer-based interventions to address mental health for AA adolescents
who are facing unprecedented risks to mental health at this time."

This multi-site R01 aims to validate video-administered cognitive assessments for use by the
Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers (ADRCs) and other research programs whose activities have been
interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as for use in future initiatives when remote testing will enhance
achievement of scientific goals. While face-to-face administration is the gold standard for cognitive
assessments, conditions often arise that prevent participants from attending in-person visits. These barriers
include transportation challenges, limited mobility, and financial hardship. There is also evidence that
underserved populations, including rural populations and racial/ethnic minorities, are less likely to enroll in
studies that require travel to an academic medical center for face-to-face testing. The proposed study will
address these challenges by utilizing a video-adapted battery incorporating the Uniform Data Set version 3
(UDSv3) measures with additional measures that may serve as alternatives for UDSv3 measures not
adaptable to video administration. We propose to fully validate these assessment tools for remote
administration in partnership with the NIA and the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC), and
carried out by a consortium of 12 ADRCs. Pilot data was gathered from 88 Wake Forest ADRC participants,
deemed by in-person testing and adjudication to have normal cognition, MCI, or dementia, who were tested
either by phone or video. Data show high participant ratings of tolerability, feasibility, and preference for video
versus telephone assessment. There is also high concordance between video-administered and in-
person test scores. Based on this collective data, we plan to fully validate a video-version of the UDSv3
battery in a range of cognitively, ethnically, and geographically diverse participants. We propose to administer
remote video cognitive assessments, paired alongside annual in-person cognitive assessments, in
counterbalanced order, to 500 existing participants from 12 ADRCs utilizing a computer tablet device, including
those previously adjudicated as having normal cognition, MCI and dementia. Participants’ ratings of
satisfaction with test condition and preference of test modality will be obtained, in addition
to the psychometric characteristics of the video battery relative to face-to-face administration, including
concurrent validity, and estimates of relative bias overall and across important subgroups (age, ethnicity,
cognitive status) and mode of administration of individual tests. Concordance between adjudication
outcomes will also be examined to assess the ability of the battery to distinguish normal cognition, MCI and
dementia. We will assess the sensitivity of the video battery to detect longitudinal change in cognition in ADRC
participants by repeating counterbalanced, in-person and remote assessments 2 years following initial
evaluation. Completion of this project is critical to the ongoing success of cognitive assessment in the ADRC
network."
10812156,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) remains a very important and growing unmet therapeutic need. The
overall goal of the studies proposed in this competitive renewal application for a grant which is
now in its 37th year of support remains to understand the mechanisms involved in kidney cell
injury and repair in order to develop therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of AKI
and its chronic consequences. The current proposal builds on prior work establishing the role of
proximal tubule cells (PTCs) in adaptive and maladaptive repair. We hypothesize that kidney
PTC cell injury results in DNA damage which triggers a DNA damage response including
breast cancer 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1), bromodomain containing protein 4 (BRD4)
activation and nuclear lamin A accumulation leading to arrest of the cell cycle, inhibition
of cell death and a senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The released
chemokines and growth factors, including hedgehog proteins, then activate COUP-TFII in
the pericyte/fibroblast by a BRD4-dependent process, converting them to activated
myofibroblasts. Male and female PTC specific BRCA1 and lamin A knockout mice, wild-type
male mice and a novel transgenic “ICE” mouse with inducible DNA damage will be used in models
of ischemic, obstructive and toxic kidney injury. Animal studies including genetic modifications
with selective knockdown of BRCA1 or lamin A expression in PTCs or COUP-TFII in fibroblasts
will be complemented by inhibitor studies and human kidney organoids, tubuloids and spheroids
to enable the study of mechanisms of injury and maladaptive repair in human cell systems ex
vivo. In Specific Aim 1 we will define the roles of PTC BRCA1 and BRD4 in maladaptive repair.
We will evaluate pathways leading from DNA damage to senescence, impaired cell death, Target
of Rapamycin (TOR)-Autophagy Spatial Coupled Compartments (TASCC) generation, and
generation of pro-fibrotic growth factors and chemokines which lead to CKD. We will also evaluate
the role of BRD4, a member of the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family, to stabilize
BRCA1 after injury, increase senescence and inhibit death of DNA damaged cells. In Specific
Aim 2 we will define the role of PTC lamin A in the pathobiology of kidney senescence and
fibrosis. Assess the effects of lamin A and ZMPSTE24, which converts prelamin A to mature lamin
A, on PTC senescence and tissue fibrosis in response to injury in vivo, and explore cellular
mechanisms using human kidney epithelial cells, kidney organoids, and tubuloids ex vivo. In
Specific Aim 3 we will evaluate the role of COUP-TFII, BRD4 and senescence on activation of
fibroblasts, enhancement of glycolytic metabolism, and generation of profibrotic mediators."

Anatomic histopathology plays a central role in disease diagnosis and in surgical procedure guidance to ensure
delivery of quality healthcare and treatment. At the time of surgery, for example, tumor margins are ideally
assessed with fast frozen section pathology to help ensure complete tumor resection while sparing normal tissue.
Unfortunately, the time- and labor-intensive slide preparation process requires expensive equipment and
specialized personnel, so it is not widely available in many settings including the rural US; even in settings with
the clinical infrastructure to perform frozen section, only a small fraction of the margin is manually examined. In
resource-limited global settings, a dire shortage of pathologists makes it more challenging to provide routine
diagnostic pathology. Therefore, there is a critical need for affordable tools to support quality histopathology
programs throughout the world. The goal of this proposal is to use recent advances in optical fabrication and
artificial intelligence to develop a new and affordable tool, the deep learning extended depth-of-field (DeepDOF)
platform, to rapidly examine fresh tissue resections without extensive slide preparation, while providing
computer-aided image analysis at the point of care. We will demonstrate and validate its use for tumor margin
assessment in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma, the sixth most common malignancy worldwide.
In Aim 1, we will develop key modules of the DeepDOF platform for rapid, subcellular imaging of freshly resected
tissue samples. A deep learning network will be developed to design and optimize the DeepDOF microscope to
image highly irregular tissue surfaces (up to 200 µm) at subcellular resolution without mechanical refocusing; we
will combine it with fast vital dyes and deep ultraviolet illumination to achieve high contrast imaging. In Aim 2, we
will carry out a clinical evaluation of DeepDOF to determine its ability to assess oral tumor margin status
immediately following surgery. The clinical workflow of DeepDOF for intraoperative oral tumor margin
assessment will be optimized, and its performance will be evaluated by comparing to gold standard
histopathology. In Aim 3, we will develop a machine learning framework to identify positive margins in and assist
annotation of large-area, cellular-resolution DeepDOF maps of oral surgical specimens. Using clinical data
acquired in Aims 1 and 2, we will train an algorithm to complete segmentation tasks for identifying key diagnostic
features such as nuclear enlargement and abnormal clustering; the results will be further used to annotate and
quantify positive margins at the point of care. Taken together, we will develop a first microscopy platform with
AI-driven optics and algorithms for rapid and slide-free histology of intact tissue samples, and we will provide
important clinical evidence to show the DeepDOF platform can improve patient care during oral cancer surgeries.
Equipped with a computer-aided image analysis, the broader impact of the DeepDOF platform extends to global
settings including low- and middle-income countries that lack access to high quality histopathology services."

surgeon-scientists, we have developed a program offering an academic career development pathway for
Otolaryngology resident trainees, and an early mentored immersive research opportunity for medical students.
This training proposal seeks funding for the formation of the Otolaryngology Surgeon-Scientist career Path
(OSSP) program at Duke University. Our proposal combines the substantial academic rigor of the Duke
University School of Medicine, with the Duke Department of Head and Neck Surgery & Communication Science’s
commitment to training surgeon-scientists, and forms a new transdisciplinary team that is uniquely qualified to
merge basic and applied Otolaryngology research with surgical practice. The program offers dedicated research
training and career development mentoring to residents matching into an ACGME-approved 7-year
Otolaryngology residency track. The training program will be co-directed by two active surgeon-scientists with
complementary areas of research expertise, involving basic science and clinical research. Program participants
will include one resident and two medical students per year. OSSP residents and students will be selected based
on academic and research achievements. Trainees will select a primary mentor from among our highly qualified
and diverse group of researchers from multiple primary departments at Duke, offering opportunities for immersive
research projects concentrated on basic, translational, or global/population health research. Medical student
trainees: students will engage in an academic-year program of dedicated research with OSSP faculty mentors.
Resident trainees: following an initial 2 years of clinical residency, trainees will follow structured didactic work
covering biostatistics, research ethics, and professional development skills, and engage in a sustained 2-year
protected mentored research block, prior to re-engaging in senior clinical training. Ongoing mentorship and
mechanisms to maintain involvement in research projects will help prepare resident trainees for successful
transition to the next phase in their academic Otolaryngology career upon completion of the OSSP program."

The monogenic, monoallelic, and seemingly stochastic transcriptional choice of one out of > 1000 olfactory
receptor (OR) genes remained elusive for decades after the discovery of the largest mammalian gene family.
However, in the past few years we obtained significant understanding on the molecular underpinnings of this
enigmatic gene regulatory process. Specifically, we showed that OR gene clusters become heterochromatic at
the early stages of olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) differentiation and then they aggregate in distinct nuclear
compartments that assure their stable repression. As a result of this interchromosomal convergence, intergenic
OR enhancers (known as Greek Islands) that are found in most OR gene clusters come in close nuclear
proximity and form a multi-chromosomal super-enhancer that in each OSN associates with the transcriptionally
active OR allele. The formation of the Greek Island hub is dependent upon the recruitment of the adaptor
protein Ldb1, which is essential for the stable interchromosomal interactions between Greek Islands and for
OR transcription. This intricate network of activating and repressive interchromosomal interactions, together
with a feedback signal elicited by the expression of the chosen OR, likely generate the regulatory framework
for transcriptional singularity. However, what remains unknown is the process by which an OR allele is
recruited to the Greek Island hub and the mechanism that assures that only one OR allele will remain stably
associated with a multi-chromosomal structure that contains numerous enhancer elements. Our preliminary
data suggest that developmentally transient OR transcription and production of nascent OR mRNAs contribute
to the recruitment of an OR allele to the Greek Island hub and to OR gene choice. Thus, we propose genetic
experiments that will determine which sequences of the sense OR mRNA are required and sufficient for
recruitment of trans OR enhancers, what proteins recognized the nascent OR mRNA and what contribution
these proteins have to the assembly of a multi-enhancer/OR complex. These experiments not only will shed
light to the enigmatic process of OR gene choice, but will also provide general molecular principles for the
mechanisms that mediate genomic compartmentalization during cellular differentiation."

Aim 1 addresses the dearth of drugs for dementia, by structure-based drug design. This approach, so
fruitful for treating cancer and HIV-AIDS, is opening for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) because of advances in
diffraction and cryoEM. Aggregation of protein Tau is strongly correlated with the onset of dementia. From
the recent near-atomic structure of Tau fibrils extracted from the autopsied brain of an Alzheimer’s patient,
the drug-binding site (or pharmacophore) has been determined for a fibril-disaggregatng compound. By
screening compounds that fit the pharmacophore, new Tau disaggregants have been discovered. These
disaggregants dissolve AD-brain Tau fibrils, but do not produce toxic products. From further cycles of
structure determination of complexes of Tau fibrils with the new disaggregants, followed by compound
screening, safe and effective compounds will be sought to reverse the toxic aggregation of Tau in the
brain. Synthetic chemist co-Investigator UCLA Prof. Patrick Harran will collaborate to apply a similar
approach to discover complexes of disaggregants with brain-penetrant nanoparticles.
Aim 2 proposes to fill the vacuum of knowledge of the structures of small aggregates of Tau and beta-
amyloid, known as oligomers. Numerous studies of others provide evidence that oligomers are more
cytotoxic than fibrils of the same protein. Oligomers of different fibril-forming proteins share structural
similarities in that particular antibodies (A11 & M204) recognize them, but not their corresponding fibrils.
The transient nature of oligomers has defeated previous attempts to learn their atomic structures, but our
lab has recently discovered a monoclonal Fab that extracts fairly homogeneous oligomers of Tau from AD
brains and stabilizes them long enough to make grids suitable for cryoEM structure determination.
Preliminary micrographs suggest that antibody ligands permit alignment of beta-amyloid oligomers for
cryoEM determination of structure, which may serve subsequently for design of inhibitors and
disaggregants.
Aim 3 proposes tests of AD drugs in “mini-brains” which are grown in the lab of our co-Investigator UCLA
Prof. Novitch. These organoids are the size of a BB yet display structure and electrical properties of actual
human brains. They are made from human cells and display the cell types and electrical messaging of
human brains. Preliminary work shows these mini-brains can be infected with Tau pathology, and now
the ability of our various drug candidates to interfere with the spreading and damage of aggregated Tau
can be tested in them. If successful, this approach can provide a new avenue for testing Alzheimer’s drugs
prior to human trials. For comparison, our inhibitors and disaggregants will also be assessed in a mouse
model of tauopathy."
10815673,"Environmental & Health-Related Risk Assessments (EHRRA) are an integral part of new product
formulation, as well as product safety stewardship. Unfortunately, the current process for conducting EHRRAs
is expensive and slow. According to the EPA report: ""FY 2021 Contributions to EPA's Portfolio of Evidence"",
the cost of conducting a Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA) Chemical Evaluation is approximately $8.4MM
over 3.5 years. Currently, most EHRRAs rely on the manual curation of data via Systematic Literature Review.
This process, while integral to the overall accuracy and completeness of EHRRAs, requires hundreds of
research hours. Therefore, academia, industry, and government regulators would all likewise benefit from a
platform which leverages machine learning to optimize EHRRA related literature and systematic reviews. More
specifically, there is currently a strong value proposition in the $534BB global cosmetic industry, $221BB global
agrochemical industry, $235BB global home cleaning supplies industry, and $1.5TT global consumer
packaged goods industry for tools that optimize SLRs for EHRRAs.
 To minimize the amount of time required by SLRs for EHRRAs, advances in machine learning (ML) are
increasingly helping researchers more quickly identify relevant pieces of information. One major obstacle to the
development and use of additional ML tools for EHRRAs is integrating such tools into existing SLR platforms.
While an increasing number of these platforms utilize, or permit the utility of, ML models, their complex
codebase makes it too cumbersome to deploy new features or integrate ML tools for specific use cases. As a
result, risk assessments continue to rely on long, manual literature reviews which, in turn, delays accessibility
to new data to make informed chemical and product safety decisions.
 The 'srvc-EHSR' platform will solve this growing market need though a git-based, remote-deployment
capable, application which enables EHRRA researchers to build customizable workflows based on
standardized, interchangeable SLR and ML components. The platform will prioritize internal and external
interoperability of components to ensure fit-for purpose adaptability. As a result, srvc-EHSR will enable more
efficient SLRs and more thorough EHRAAs, thereby decreasing the time-to-market for new products and
increasing the overall safety of consumer and industrial chemicals.
 While the fully commercialized srvc-EHSR will integrate the features above, Phase I will target
feasibility for component modularity and interchangeability, ML development, and prototype interface.
Development will leverage existing assets, BioBricks.ai and Sysrev, to develop core Phase I srvc-EHSR
components as cost-efficiently as possible. A prototype cloud based application, terminal interface, software
“packages”, and API will be developed and deployed in a usability study by the Phase I Commercial Partner
wherein researchers will use srvc-EHSR to review documents for environmental, chemical, and health data."

 Huntington’s disease (HD) and Friedreich ataxia (FA) are rare neurodegenerative diseases caused
by expanded trinucleotide repeats (CAG and GAA, respectively) in the HTT and FXN genes,
respectively, with larger alleles being associated with earlier disease onset and more severe clinical
phenotypes. Despite these being single gene disorders, where the respective underlying genetic
mutations have been known for over 20 years, there remains no cure or disease-modifying therapies,
indicating that novel approaches are critical. A hallmark of most repeat expansion disorders is that the
repeats are highly unstable, both intergenerationally (parent to child) and in somatic tissues, where the
repeat expands progressively over time in a cell-/tissue-specific manner. Notably, in HD, medium-spiny
neurons of the striatum, which succumb most severely to the effects of the HTT mutation, exhibit the
most dramatic CAG expansions. Similarly, larger GAA repeat expansions have been reported in the
heart and dorsal root ganglia of FA patients, where such tissues are most severely affected. These
observations, together with growing evidence from GWAS and candidate gene association studies in
HD patients, support the hypothesis that progressive repeat length increases in somatic tissues
contribute to the pathogenic process. Thus, understanding the roles of disease modifiers in somatic
repeat expansion may provide novel targets for therapeutic intervention directed at the repeat mutation
itself. To that end, we have leveraged a CRISPR-based in vivo system, recently developed by us, to
screen a number of candidate DNA repair genes and determine their role as potential modifiers of
somatic CAG repeat instability in HD. Remarkably, this has resulted in the identification of novel genes,
which when knocked out in the liver of HD mice, reduced CAG expansions and promoted contractions.
 We hereby propose a set of experiments aimed at: 1) Identifying non-invasive samples to study
CAG repeat instability as a potential biomarker of disease, as well as developing novel long-read
sequencing-based methodologies to more accurately size and quantify repeat instability; 2) Validating
candidate modifier genes in a new model of CAG expansions using HD patient-derived fibroblasts,
recently developed by us, as well as understand the potential adverse implications associated with
inactivating such DNA repair genes. We also propose to investigate if such genes are equally involved
in FA GAA expansions, using the same in vivo CRISPR platform and patient derived cellular models;
3) Development and testing of novel antisense oligonucleotide- and CRISPR-based therapeutic
approaches targeting the repeat expansion process to suppress repeat expansions or actually promote
contractions. This will lead to a better understanding of shared mechanisms across these diseases and
potentially result in novel therapeutics that can be used in all repeat expansion disorders."

quorum sensing, the selective pressures favoring quorum-sensing control of gene expression, and the costs
and benefits of quorum sensing in P. aeruginosa. Quorum sensing functions to control and coordinate
cooperative behaviors. It is clear that cooperativity is an evolved biological phenomenon, but there is
considerable controversy about the selective forces allowing stable cooperativity. What are the costs and
benefits of cooperativity, and what are the possible advantages to controlling cooperativity by quorum sensing?
In the past five years we have made enormous advances in understanding at a molecular level how
cooperation is stabilized in P. aeruginosa and how we can destabilize it. These advances are important to the
field of population biology and to our understanding of the roles P. aeruginosa quorum sensing plays in certain
infections. Our continued research will use molecular genetic approaches to investigate the quorum sensing
control of gene expression, and we will continue to introduce new techniques and concepts into what has
become a vibrant field of microbiological research. Specifically we will ask questions about the determinants of
signal specificity and the potential for bacterial species to eavesdrop on each other. We will attempt to define
the determinants of signal generation and reception selectivity. We want to better understand the role of
quorum sensing during human infections with our initial emphasis on the chronic lung infections that plague
people with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis. We have recently learned that one of the least understood
components of P. aeruginosa quorum sensing circuitry, RhlR is a key quorum-sensing element in P.
aeruginosa. Our recent work has allowed us to overcome the major obstacle in learning about RhlR, an
inability to study it in vitro. The long term vision of this work is to understand how and why quorum sensing
circuits are often layered, to understand how the diversity of quorum sensing systems has evolved to its
current state, and to attain a conceptual framework to explain how communication and cooperative activities
are wired to provide stability of bacterial group activities and how we might be able to use the knowledge to
manipulate bacterial populations."
10817064,"Myosin 18 and its role in skeletal muscle: H. Lee Sweeney, P.I.
Abstract:
This project will investigate the structure and function of an unconventional myosin, myosin XVIII (Myo18). One
of the two forms Myo18 expressed in vertebrates, Myo18B, is critical for the generation of sarcomeres in
striated muscle. The other form, Myo18A is found in all cells, including muscle, where it may function in other
critical cellular processes that require Myo2 filament recruitment and organization, including the early stages of
sarcomere formation in striated muscle. Mutations that result in the loss of Myo18B result in myopathies in
humans. While Myo18 has been characterized as a non-motor, scaffolding protein, that aids in the assembly of
Myo2 filaments, we postulate that it is in fact an active motor protein subject to a novel form of regulation. Only
by understanding the design and function of this motor, and using those insights to probe sarcomere formation
in muscle cells, will we begin to understand the roles that Myo18 plays in striated muscle and ultimately in
other tissues."

Immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) is a rare, life-threatening disorder characterized by acute
episodes of systemic microvascular thrombosis caused by deficiency of ADAMTS13, a von Willebrand factor
cleaving protease. iTTP survivors remain at risk for multiple adverse neurologic outcomes including cognitive
impairment and a five-fold increased risk of stroke. During the K99 award, Dr. Chaturvedi conducted a single-
center prospective study and established that 50% of iTTP survivors have silent cerebral infarction (SCI),
defined as magnetic resonance imaging evidence of brain ischemia in the absence of overt neurologic deficits,
which is a much higher rate than reported in population-based cohorts. SCI is also independently associated
with cognitive impairment in iTTP survivors. Critical unanswered questions that are addressed in this R00
proposal are: 1) do SCI occur during iTTP remission or are they only sequelae of acute iTTP, or both? 2) are
SCI a risk factor for future stroke, and 3) how can we prevent SCI and their devastating neurologic sequelae
(cognitive impairment and stroke)? The applicant will build upon the K99 study to conduct a multi-center
observational study at three clinical sites with established prospective iTTP cohorts and a track record of
research in iTTP (Johns Hopkins University, Ohio State University, and University of Minnesota). Aim 1 will
elucidate the natural history of SCI and establish the incidence and risk factors for new SCI and stroke
occurring during clinical remission of iTTP, with a focus on remission ADAMTS13 activity and other modifiable
risk factors such as hypertension. Aim 2 will evaluate the impact of the novel anti-VWF therapy
(caplacizumab), used in the treatment acute iTTP, on the prevalence of SCI and cognitive impairment by
comparing with matched patients treated without caplacizumab, and adjusting for other acute iTTP specific
variables such as neurologic involvement at presentation, and time to clinical response and ADAMTS13
activity recovery. Dr. Chaturvedi and her research team have established the infrastructure, expertise,
protocols and have a record of accomplishment of successful clinical research in rare diseases. This R00
proposal will provide critical data that will directly impact clinical care in iTTP. Identifying whether early anti-
VWF therapy or maintaining higher remission ADAMTS13 protect against SCI and cognitive impairment will
change current paradigms of treatment where anti-VWF is not considered universally cost-effective, and only
ADAMTS13 levels <20% are targeted to prevent relapse. if we establish that SCI are strongly associated with
stroke, then SCI is an attractive shorter-term endpoint for an intervention to reduce the burden of
cerebrovascular disease, potentially reducing the duration and expense of clinical trials. In addition to building
infrastructure for and informing the design of a subsequent clinical trial of an intervention to alleviate the long-
term neurologic morbidity of iTTP, this R00 proposal will also build a data and sample biorepository to
investigate biomarkers and mechanisms of SCI in iTTP for a subsequent R01 application."
10816678,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) is a common cause of hip pain and disability and a known
risk factor for hip osteoarthritis (OA). Patients with FAIS present with a loss of sphericity of the femoral head,
reduction in femoral-neck offset, and/or prominent acetabular wall. Patient symptoms as well as patterns of soft
tissue damage to hip cartilage and labrum (i.e., ‘chondrolabral’) tissues support the clinical theory that hip
pathoanatomy creates pathomechanics. Still, the presence of impingement deformities does not reliably predict
symptoms, soft tissue damage, or OA status. Earlier detection of structural and compositional changes to
cartilage and labrum would enhance clinical diagnostics and decision making for FAIS. Small, physiologic
changes in the water content of cartilage and associated changes in proteoglycan content and collagen density
– factors involved in early joint OA – can be evaluated by T1ρ and T2 mapping with quantitative MRI (qMRI).
 Here, we propose an ancillary R21 study to interrogate relationships between hip anatomy, biomechanics,
and image-based measurements of cartilage and labrum ultrastructure provided by qMRI. We will incorporate
qMRI into our existing imaging workflow for the Parent R01. We will then leverage the statistical shape models
(SSM) and finite element (FE) modeling data provided by the parent R01 to study form-function relationships in
FAIS through two aims. Aim 1 will investigate links between hip morphology and chondrolabral tissue
ultrastructure by quantifying associations between spatial T1ρ and T2 maps of cartilage and labrum with a local
measure of the shape of proximal femur and acetabular bone shape as evaluated by a 3D statistical shape
model. Aim 2 will then investigate links between hip mechanics and chondrolabral tissue ultrastructure by
quantifying associations between spatial T1ρ and T2 maps with a local prediction of the stress and strain in the
cartilage and labrum as evaluated by patient-specific finite element models. We will test the hypothesis that
regions of greater bone deformity and elevated chondrolabral stress and strain as predicted by SSM and FE,
respectively, will coincide with regions of decreased proteoglycan content and loss of collagen organization, as
estimated by qMRI.
 The ancillary R21 complements and leverages the parent R01 project in ways that will help us to identify
mechanisms underpinning chondrolabral damage and hip OA in patients with FAIS. To our knowledge, this will
be the first study to demonstrate the spatial correlation of T1ρ and T2 maps with 3D hip shape and chondrolabral
stresses/strains. This information will provide more direct evidence linking hip anatomy and biomechanics with
biochemical changes associated with OA. In the future, the developed framework could be expanded to develop
imaging biomarkers that predict hips at risk of degeneration and to evaluate the longitudinal effects of operative
or non-operative treatments for FAIS."
10820949,"Project Summary/Abstract
Nearly all modern drug discovery efforts begin with a virtual screening campaign, and there are
now several drugs available on the market that were originally identified through computational
efforts. Small molecule drug discovery, in particular, has benefited from the integration of
computational chemistry tools that have become capable of the necessary throughput due to
advances in computational power and algorithmic development. Binding free energy
calculations have enhanced the practice of small molecule lead optimization and have helped
expedite the development of effective drugs to transform the healthcare landscape.
Peptide drugs are widely considered to be a promising, yet currently underutilized, class of
drugs due to their high level of tunability with modern synthesis methods. Their large exposed
surface area relative to small molecule drugs supports an increased level of specificity and the
roughly 80 peptide drugs currently available on the market represent some of the highest
therapeutic indices of known drugs. Peptide drugs even offer the opportunity to address targets
that were previously thought to be undruggable.
Peptide drugs are situated to similarly benefit from computational lead optimization strategies,
but the application of existing tools for accelerating discovery efforts is less established than for
small molecule drugs. The barrier for achieving widespread success in computational peptide
lead optimization is two-fold: the increased size of peptide drugs makes the necessary
conformational sampling more challenging, and the diversity in chemical character among
different peptide drugs makes it difficult to fit a reliable classical simulation model. The former
challenge can be overcome through efficient conformational sampling approaches, while the
latter can be addressed by quantum mechanical calculations that avoid the need for a restrictive
fit to analytical models. Overcoming both of these challenges simultaneously requires an
innovative approach, because the solutions to each of them independently have been, until
recently, mutually exclusive.
The objective of the proposed research is to make computational lead optimization reliable for
peptide drug discovery by developing a machine learning-based peptide simulation model that
simultaneously overcomes both of the aforementioned challenges. We will achieve this by
training a machine learning potential on the basis of quantum mechanical simulation data, which
will be implemented on our QSP Life molecular simulation platform for efficiently calculating
peptide binding free energies."
10821523,"Significance: High-content microscopy is rapidly accelerating biological research and drug
development. Unfortunately, existing imaging systems fail to efficiently image three-dimensional disease
models, such as organoid cultures, at the throughput required by clinical and commercial researchers.
Generating mature brain organoids, in particular, is a complex process that requires months of intensive
and costly maintenance with regular imaging to assess health and structure. One of the primary
drawbacks of standard microscopes is their need to step-and-scan across a well plate, which can take
minutes to image all wells in two dimensions, and an hour or more for 3D capture. This not only leads to
cumbersome experimentation with a limited number of specimens, but also prevents current high-content
experiments from measuring short-term (< 1 hour) 3D morphological dynamics, such as neural activity.
Proposal: Ramona Optics is developing a new imaging platform for rapid high-content 3D screening of
brain organoids to effectively assess of dozens of well plates/day across at least 90 days of differentiation.
We will also develop image analysis software to identify, measure and track organoid volume and 3D
morphology over time. These new capabilities should significantly expedite imaging workflow and yield
novel insights into organoid development within high-content experimentation. After carefully testing the
3D imaging performance of our parallelized microscope and assessing higher-resolution optics in this
Phase I proposal, we aim to enhance performance with fluorescence capabilities in a Phase II effort,
focused on live-cell whole-plate recording of neural activity in large numbers of brain organoids.
 SA1: Parallelized microscope hardware improvement: Ramona Optics will produce new
parallelized microscope hardware to simultaneously image 96 full wells (8x12 FOV) at 3 µm and 39 µm
half-pitch lateral and axial resolution, respectively. We will also develop hardware and firmware capable
of axial scanning across 1500 µm at 20 µm step size (75 axial slices) to produce a full well plate focal
stack in 7.5 sec., >100X less time than what state-of-the-art scanning high-content microscopes require.
 SA2: Automated organoid analysis software: We will produce software to map acquired whole-
plate axial scan measurements into per-organoid 3D measurements and associated statistics in <45 sec.
We will also create a user interface to longitudinally track per-organoid measurements.
 SA3: Longitudinal testing and verification of 3D brain organoid shape/size: With the Stein
Lab at UNC, we will evaluate the platform for high-content longitudinal measurement of brain organoid
shape/size. We will image 20 plates (96 organoids each) daily for 90 days and aim for 95% correlation
with current standard measurement methods across a variety of organoid morphologies and sizes. We
will also assess 3D scan specs with higher resolution optics (0.8 and 0.5 µm/pixel) and fluorescence."

Mitral regurgitation (MR) is the most common type of valvular heart disease in patients over age 75. Almost half
of the patients identified with moderate-severe MR are not candidates for open-heart surgery due to frailty and
co-morbidities. MitraClip (MC) is a recent percutaneous approach whereby a clip is placed in the center of the
MR “jet” to reduce MR. Currently, when clinicians prepare to place the MC on the mitral valve (MV), they have
data on the degree of MR, and the size and shape of the MV and LV measured using real-time 3D
transesophageal echocardiography (RT3D-TEE). Myocardial and leaflet stresses, however, are not considered
in the current MC placement strategy. Additionally, mean left atrial pressure (MLAP) has been introduced to
assess long-term MC outcomes. The objective of this Fast-Track proposal is to develop and validate a machine
learning (ML)-based MC placement software tool (MCP-ST) for finding the optimal MC scenarios and real-time
predictions of MR, MLAP, MV leaflet stresses, and myocardial stresses, which are known to affect, respectively,
the safety of device placements and the cardiac function. Accordingly, Specific Aims are proposed: Phase I)
Generate a dataset of MR, MLAP, MV, and LV stress. AIM 1: Finite element (FE) structural simulation of
the MV + LV of patients from a retrospective data base. To add additional retrospective patient data to our
current dataset. Milestone 1: A dataset of MV geometrical parameters, MR, MLAP, MV stress, and LV stress
from over 5,000 FE models obtained from over 1,000 patient images. Timeframe: 6 months from the award date.
Phase II) Automating computing MR, MLAP, MV, and LV stress from DICOM data and testing the results
using animal experiments. To automate the prediction of MC therapy outcomes by approximating MR, MLAP,
MV, and LV stresses from echo images. Milestone 2: Manually process echo images to create a dataset of echo
images. Milestone 3: ML model development to process echo images and integrate this ML model into the ML
workflow that predicts MR, MLAP, MV, and LV stress. Timeframe: 12 months from the award date. Milestone 3:
Assessing the performance of the respective ML workflow in swine. Timeframe: 24 months from the award date.
AIM 2: Automation of echo image processing for ML predictions and Validation of Animal Studies. To
develop an ML platform that predicts MR, MLAP, MV, and LV stresses from echo images and to assess its
performance using swine experiments. Timeframe: 24 months from the award date. AIM 3: Prepare
submission package for software as a medical device. To submit a package to FDA that includes good
laboratory practices (GLP) animal study, verification and validation of software, as well as full quality
documentation. Milestone 4: Assess the performance of the respective ML workflow in swine. Timeframe: 30
months from the award date. Moreover, the proposed research provides a template for developing and validating
ML algorithms concerned with other cardiac conditions in line with precision/physics-based medicine."

Biomedical applications in both research and clinical settings rely on microinjection protocols that require using
a hollow microcapillary needle to deliver foreign substances (e.g., nucleic acids, proteins, viruses, cells, and
nanoparticles) directly into biological targets (e.g., cells, embryos, and tissues). This transgenic engineering
technique has driven advances in fundamental research in areas including cell, systems, and developmental
biology, stem cell gene manipulation, and human disease prevention modeling, as well as for medical
applications including in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle therapy, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, and
intraocular injection. However, the industry standard microneedles (ISNs) used for microinjection in research
settings are typically produced lab-by-lab by physically “pulling” apart transparent glass capillary tubes, which
results in needle variability. The inconsistencies can negatively affect experimental rigor, reproducibility,
productivity, and microinjection efficacy. Thus, the ability to enhance and expand the capabilities of the
microneedles that enable microinjection protocols could significantly impact diverse biomedical fields and
applications. We hypothesize that by leveraging well-established “pyrolysis” post-processing strategies for
enhancing the mechanical properties of DLW-printed 3D microstructures, we can achieve mechanically robust
microinjection needles—based on our pending-patented MSP design—that simultaneously address all the pain
points of ISNs. This proposal will systematically evaluate the utility of the mechanically robust 3D-printed
microcapillary needles versus ISNs with regard to key quantitative metrics of performance underlying material
delivery into zebrafish embryos by: 1) establishing and characterizing pyrolysis protocols for DLW-printed 3D
microneedles, 2) Interrogating the mechanical properties of pyrolyzed 3D microneedle prototypes in vitro, and
3) evaluating microinjection efficacy of pyrolyzed DLW-printed 3D microneedle prototypes versus ISNs using
live zebrafish embryos in vivo. These innovative, geometrically sophisticated, functionally advantageous
microneedle with robust mechanically properties hold unique promise to allow for fast, accurate, and consistent
microinjections with minimal damage to injection targets (e.g., embryos)."

Hybridization Chain Reaction:
Automated Ultrasensitive Multiplex RNA and Protein Imaging
Encoded in the genome of each organism, biological circuits direct development, maintain integrity in the face of
attacks, control responses to environmental stimuli, and sometimes malfunction to cause disease. RNA in situ
hybridization (RNA-ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) methods provide drug developers, pathologists, and
biologists with critical windows into the spatial organization of this circuitry, enabling imaging of RNA and protein
expression in an anatomical context. While it is desirable to perform multiplex experiments in which a panel of
targets is imaged with single-molecule sensitivity at low magniﬁcation over a large ﬁeld-of-view within intact tissue,
the dominant automated RNA-ISH and IHC methods struggle to provide these capabilities. First, multiplexing
is cumbersome, requiring serial enzyme-mediated signal ampliﬁcation for each target in succession (currently
limited to 2-plex for chromogenic staining of RNA targets and often requiring probe stripping for protein targets).
Second, sensitivity is routinely limiting at the low magniﬁcations essential to rapid screening of large ﬁelds-of-view;
this problem is only exacerbated for short RNA targets, low-expression targets, and archival tissue sections. Third,
there is no uniﬁed technology for automated imaging of RNA and protein targets. Current automated RNA-ISH
approaches require a protease pretreatment step that digests proteins to enable large reagents to penetrate the
sample; this digestion step comes at a high cost both because it damages the tissue morphology and because it
makes it challenging or impossible to image protein targets in the same sample. Collectively, these multi-decade
technology gaps are signiﬁcant impediments to drug development, clinical pathology, and biological research,
undermining multi-dimensional analyses of genetic regulatory networks in an anatomical context.
 To overcome these challenges, in situ ampliﬁcation based on the mechanism of hybridization chain reaction
(HCR) draws on concepts from the emerging discipline of dynamic nucleic acid nanotechnology to provide the
ﬁrst uniﬁed framework for simultaneous RNA and protein imaging, achieving multiple breakthroughs to enable
multiplex, quantitative, high-resolution RNA and protein imaging in highly autoﬂuorescent samples. To empower
high-velocity biopharma drug development and clinical diagnostics workﬂows, the proposed R&D will build on the
unique capabilities of HCR to: 1) engineer a novel chromogenic signal ampliﬁcation cascade to enable automated
ultrasensitive 4-plex RNA chromogenic in situ hybridization (RNA-CISH), IHC, and simultaneous RNA-CISH/IHC
at low magniﬁcation for rapid whole-slide scanning, 2) engineer a novel enzyme-free ﬂuorescent signal ampli-
ﬁcation cascade to enable automated ultrasensitive 4-plex RNA ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH),
immunoﬂuorescence (IF), and simultaneous RNA-FISH/IF at low magniﬁcation for rapid whole-slide scanning.
These capabilities will enable drug developers, pathologists, and biologists to perform automated, ultrasensi-
tive, multiplex analyses of RNAs and proteins in an anatomical context using either chromogenic or ﬂuorescent
workﬂows."

Infection-induced developmental divergence in the transplacental transmission strategy of Toxoplasma
gondii. Toxoplasma gondii is the world’s most ubiquitous human parasitic infection. Infection of pregnant women
can result in transmission of the parasite to the developing fetus, often causing devastating birth defects. Fetal
infection requires the parasite to cross the maternal-fetal barrier, a junction primarily defended by the placenta.
The strategy by which T. gondii surmounts this tissue barrier is poorly understood at both the cellular and
molecular level. Critical to this process are placental trophoblasts, cells that undergo coordinated development
into distinct differentiated subtypes (most notably progenitor cytotrophoblasts, CYTs; syncytiotrophoblasts,
SYNs; and extravillous trophoblasts; EVTs) to form the maternofetal interface, and which previous data show
are differentially susceptible to T. gondii infection. The proposed studies test the hypothesis that T. gondii
infection of CYTs alters their developmental trajectory to promote parasite infection in a manner that disrupts
proper placental and fetal development. This hypothesis was formulated based on preliminary transcriptome and
immunofluorescence data showing that T. gondii-infected CYTs bear gene expression signatures that are more
similar to infection-permissive EVTs compared to infection-resistant SYNs. These data suggest that T. gondii-
infection alters cell fate to favor one lineage at the cost of the other, possibly to its own advantage. In the
proposed studies I will use a bipotent in vitro trophoblast stem cell system and organoid model of placental
development to investigate 1) the extent of T. gondii-driven disruption of placental trophoblast development and
2) how this impacts placental trophoblast function."
10822701,"Project Summary:
The primary objective of this proposed research program is to evaluate in a clinical trial the improvements to
clinical outcomes that the use of a software for supporting physicians during the percutaneous microwave
ablation of liver tumors can result in. In percutaneous microwave ablation a needle-shaped ablation probe is
inserted in the tumor by entering the body through the skin. The tip of the probe can emit microwaves and heat
the tissues, killing a certain volume of tissues around the tip of the probe. The goal is to kill completely the
tumor by performing a single ablation, for smaller tumors, or by placing the probe at multiple positions and
performing multiple ablations that cover all the tumor volume. During the procedure the patient lies in a CT
scanner and several images are acquired to visualize the position of the probe and of the tumor. It is
challenging though for physicians to evaluate from these images which part of the tumor has been killed and
which not – as a consequence, the procedure might be terminated early thinking that all malignant tissues
have been treated, while small portions of the tumor are in practice left untreated. Depending on the tumor size
this can happen in 20% (medium tumors) to 50% (large tumors) of cases. NE Scientific has developed a
software which is able to simulate the physics taking place during the procedure and to determine which
tissues are killed based on the simulations. The killed tissues, estimated based on the simulation, are
highlighted on the CT images during the procedure, so that the physician always know which part of the tumor
might still need to be killed. This computerized aid to physicians should result in a much lower rate of
incomplete ablations. The trial part of this program will monitor the rate of tumor recurrence (arising from
incomplete ablations) in 84 patients which will undergo microwave ablation for treating liver tumors. If the trial
is successful, microwave ablation, combined with computerized guidance, will be a minimally invasive cancer
treatment option which does not present the side effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy."

Heterozygous loss-of-function (LOF) is a common genetic mechanism among many monogenic epilepsy genes
including KCNQ2, which encodes a brain voltage-gated potassium channel (Kv7.2). Pathogenic KCNQ2 variants
are associated with severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathies that lack targeted treatments. We
identified an upstream open reading frame (uORF) within the 5’-untranslated region (5’-UTR) of the KCNQ2
mRNA transcript that competes with the canonical reading frame for translation and attenuates Kv7.2 functional
expression in non-neuronal cells. Because suppressing uORF translation could be an effective strategy for
boosting KCNQ2 expression in the setting of heterozygous LOF, we seek to determine the physiological
relevance of the KCNQ2 uORF (Aim 1), and to target the uORF with antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) using a
structure-driven approach (Aim 2). Our approach to Aim 1 will involve genome editing of human induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) to inactivate the uORF start codon and to compare uORF usage, Kv7.2 translation,
and electrophysiological properties of the channel in neurons differentiated from edited and non-edited iPSC
lines. For Aim 2, we will experimentally deduce the secondary structure of the KCNQ2 5’-UTR, then design a
series of ASOs targeting the least structured regions proximal to the uORF. We will then confirm binding of
candidate ASOs to the KCNQ2 mRNA transcript and determine if an ASO strategy will boost Kv7.2 translation
and function. These studies will clarify the physiological relevance of the uORF and identify a potential
therapeutic strategy to correct heterozygous LOF in this epilepsy gene."

of these adult-born neurons (ABNs) become granule cells that provide inhibition through the spines at their
apical dendrites onto the principal mitral/tufted cells. In this proposal, we will characterize the synaptic
structural plasticity of ABNs in the olfactory bulb and investigate its context-specificity and mechanisms.
Understanding the detailed mechanisms of context-specific plasticity would have an important impact on
clinical disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, age-related dementia, and post-traumatic stress disorders. Our
central hypotheses are that 1) ABNs increase the density of their apical dendritic spines during
learning of an olfactory discrimination task but not during passive experience of the same odorants,
and 2) this context-specificity of ABN plasticity is ensured by feedback projections from the piriform
cortex to the olfactory bulb which increases dendritic activity of ABNs during task learning. Such a
context-specific recruitment of ABN inhibition could provide the basis for stimulus-specific inhibition to promote
the pattern separation of representations of task-relevant odorants.
 We will address these hypotheses by combining in vivo two-photon structural imaging, in vivo two-

Tuberculosis (TB) is now the leading infectious cause of death globally, and it remains the #1 cause of
death among people living with HIV (PLWH). The first-line regimen is long and burdensome to patients
and programs, and drug-resistant TB typically requires treatment for 1-2 years with drugs that can cause
severe or irreversible toxicities. The TB drug development pipeline is now robust, providing reason for
optimism. To optimize current and new drugs, though, we must employ state-of-the-art drug
development approaches (including best use of quantitative pharmacology), and it is imperative that new
drugs or regimens be developed so that they can be used in all patients that may benefit from them,
including PLWH, children, and pregnant women. Critical challenges and opportunities lie in using
clinically pharmacology as a tool more effectively in TB and HIV therapeutics research, across the drug
development and optimization spectrum. This is the context for this application for a K24 Mid-Career
Development Award for Kelly Dooley, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Medicine, Pharmacology, &
Molecular Sciences in the Divisions of Clinical Pharmacology and Infectious Diseases at Johns Hopkins
University, to provide protected time to mentor trainees in patient-oriented research in TB and HIV
therapeutics. Dr. Dooley is one of the few Infectious Diseases specialists with training in Clinical
Pharmacology working in the TB therapeutics field. She is a globally-recognized leader in TB and HIV-
associated TB treatment research and has mentored (and is mentoring) multiple trainees in the field.
Through the multiple independently-funded studies she is leading as well as those she is directing in her
capacity as a member of the TB scientific leadership committees of the ACTG, TBTC, and IMPAACT
networks, she is in a position to provide excellent opportunities to train the next generation of clinical
researchers in patient-oriented research in TB and HIV. In addition, this K24 will allow her to expand her
own knowledge in several key areas: quantitative pharmacology approaches, as applied to design and
analysis in clinical trials of TB or TB-HIV treatment; biomarkers identification and use as well as
understanding of drug delivery to hard-to-access compartments, for example in tuberculous meningitis;
and a new area of critical unmet medical need, the treatment of nontuberculous mycobacteria (in
patients with and without HIV). This K24 will allow Dr. Dooley to have the protected time to train the next
generation of investigators in clinical pharmacology and clinical research, as applied to TB and HIV-
associated TB, a critical shortage area; expand quantitative approaches in TB therapeutics work; and
explore new areas of investigation. The protected time afforded by this award is essential to Dr. Dooley
achieving these goals."

The goal of this proposal is to improve treatment selection and survival in women with advanced ovarian
cancer. Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of deaths from gynecologic cancers in the U.S. Most women
present with advanced disease, with distant spread at the time of diagnosis. Even so, more than 1 in 10 of
such women will survive >10 years after an initial diagnosis, usually with periodic recurrences. The possibility
of long-term survival underscores the paramount importance of each treatment decision.
Determining the best treatment strategy for an individual patient is difficult. For women with newly diagnosed,
advanced ovarian cancer, both surgery and chemotherapy are recommended. However, many women fail to
complete both, rates of death from surgery are high, and chemotherapy delivery is often limited by toxicities.
New therapies that are designed to target cells at the molecular level (“PARP inhibitors”) have recently been
approved for use, but their benefits vary based on the presence of specific tumor mutations, and their costs
exceed $150,000/year. Carefully tailored decisions about the sequence of surgery and chemotherapy, types of
chemotherapy, and the way chemotherapy is delivered, could improve long-term outcomes and reduce costs.
To address this problem, we will build a simulation modeling framework that projects the outcomes of women
treated for advanced ovarian cancer, and use it to identify personalized treatment approaches. We have built a
preliminary model that projects outcomes for women with newly diagnosed, advanced ovarian cancer. We will
extend our model to include detailed patient and tumor characteristics – age, comorbidities, stage, and
mutation status – that influence survival, as well as new therapies and toxicities (Aim 1.1). We will also
simulate the treatment of recurrent cancer (Aim 1.2). Using our new modeling framework, we will identify
tailored treatment approaches that optimize survival (Aim 2.1), minimize treatment toxicities (Aim 2.2), and are
cost-effective (Aim 3). Finally, we will identify future studies that are likely to have the greatest impact in
improving treatment decisions (Aim 4).
To ensure that our findings are accessible to patients, physicians, and policymakers, we will create an online,
interactive version of our modeling framework that can project outcomes, quantify trade-offs, and support
decision-making in real time. The proposed research will result in: 1) personalized treatment
recommendations; 2) real-time guidance for decision-making; 3) the capacity to rapidly weigh benefits of new
therapies with long-term risks and costs; and 4) prioritization of future research. The knowledge gained will
provide new opportunities to improve treatment selection and survival in ovarian cancer."
10788422,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Coordination of breathing with postinspiratory behaviors such as swallowing and laryngeal adduction is
essential to health. Dysregulation of laryngeal activity during postinspiration and swallow occurs in many
neurological and breathing-related disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea, and can increase the risk of
disordered swallow (dysphagia) and aspiration. Dysphagia is a major problem in patients with these diseases,
and there are currently no treatments to cure or prevent dysphagia. This deficit is due in part to the lack of
studies on coordination of breathing with laryngeal function of postinspiration and swallow. The recently
described brainstem Postinspiratory Complex (PiCo) is thought to control postinspiration, yet its role in other
laryngeal behaviors has not been studied. We test a fundamentally new hypothesis that excitatory medullary
transmission from PiCo to the swallow pattern generator plays a role in swallow-related postinspiratory
behavior. Our goals is to define the role of PiCo in postinspiratory laryngeal activity and swallow, and
investigate potential coordination between the dorsal swallow group (DSG) and the ventral respiratory group
(VRG). Based on preliminary data, we hypothesize that PiCo is a hub for both postinspiratory activity and
swallowing, and has connections to the presumed swallow pattern generator in the nucleus tractus solitarius
(nTS). We believe PiCo plays a role in swallow-related rhythmic activities which includes the nTS as the
presumed swallow rhythm generator with projections to ventral respiratory centers. We use two in-vivo
preparation: anesthetized and alert mouse combined with electrophysiology, novel optogenetics and
Neuropixel recordings to test these hypotheses. We predict neural coordination of PiCo activity with respiratory
and non-respiratory centers is similar between anesthetized and unanesthetized preparations. Investigating
PiCo in an alert animal is important for characterizing the natural behaviors of swallow and laryngeal
postinspiratory activity in a translational manner."
10786357,"Virus-Bacterial interactions in genital herpes infections
Mucosal viruses encounter resident bacteria before they encounter and activate the immune
response and these interactions can affect viral infection and replication. These virus-bacterial
interactions heavily influence viral infections in the intestinal tract but are understudied in the
vaginal mucosa. Studies have shown that vaginal lactobacilli can interact with herpes simplex
virus however the bacterial components involved in this interaction remain unknown. Our
preliminary data show that vaginal lactobacilli interact with herpes simplex virus and inhibit
infectivity to a much greater extent than gut lactobacilli. Additionally, this interaction is
independent of lactic acid as dead bacteria are equivalently inhibitory. Further, we were able to
mimic this interaction using peptidoglycan from non-vaginal gram-positive bacteria.
In this proposal, we aim to explore the role of purified peptidoglycan from vaginal lactobacilli
strains and compare their efficacy against gut lactobacilli (Aim 1). We will explore the role of
peptidoglycan-sensing innate immune receptors in this viral suppression (Aim 2). We will define
the relevance of these observations to human health by quantifying vaginal peptidoglycan in
vaginal samples from people with lactobacilli-dominant microbiomes and bacterial vaginosis
patients who have lost their vaginal lactobacilli and have been clinically shown to have
increased shedding of herpes simplex virus. These experiments aim to propose a mechanistic
basis for clinical observations linking abundance of vaginal lactobacilli to reduced viral infection
and replication."

Worldwide, nearly 3 million children die each year from sepsis. Red blood cells (RBC) are transfused in ~50%
of children with septic shock, with the intent to enhance oxygen delivery, help resolve shock, and prevent
organ dysfunction. However, RBC transfusion has repeatedly been associated with adverse outcomes in
critical illness, suggesting harm. For most children with septic shock we lack data to identify who should or
should not be transfused. Interventional trials and RBC transfusion guidelines have used hemoglobin
concentration alone to inform RBC transfusion decisions. However, this is likely not the best way to decide
when to transfuse RBCs to a patient with shock. Our preliminary data in septic children suggest that
hemodynamic measures better identify children who might benefit from RBC transfusion and that children with
severe immune suppression may be at greater risks of transfusion-related harm. Lastly, our data show that
RBC transfusion effects likely differ based on RBC unit collection, storage, and processing methods, and
resultant quantities of soluble mediators. Together, these data support our hypothesis that physiologic and
blood product factors will predict when children with septic shock will benefit from, or be harmed by, RBC
transfusion. The overall goal of our research program is to develop a personalized-medicine approach to
RBC transfusion in children with septic shock. Our objective for this proposal is to build decision support tools
that can be used in future clinical trials to identify when children with septic shock should or should not be
transfused with RBCs. Our proposal uses robust machine learning techniques that are designed to use a very
large number of dynamic variables to define personalized treatment decisions that maximize clinical outcomes.
With these methods, and an agnostic, data-driven approach, the resultant decision rules will be free of clinician
bias and can consider a much wider array of clinical parameters than have traditionally been used in
transfusion trials. We will conduct a multicenter prospective observational study of 660 children with septic
shock to accomplish the following specific aims: Aim 1: Determine which clinical, hemodynamic, and blood
product-specific factors should drive RBC transfusion decision-making in children with septic shock.
Using data from the electronic medical record, we will use outcome-weighted learning to build dynamic
transfusion algorithms to minimize predicted daily organ dysfunction (PELOD2 scores). Aim 2: Identify
immune phenotypes that predict differential response to RBC transfusion in children with septic
shock. We will collect serial blood samples from subjects to measure a validated panel of inflammatory and
immune function biomarkers and test the hypothesis that outcomes related to RBC transfusion will differ based
on pre-transfusion levels of biomarkers of inflammation and/or immune suppression. We expect our data to
transform the design of interventional trials of data-driven RBC transfusion algorithms to shift the transfusion
paradigm away from hemoglobin-based strategies and improve outcomes for critically ill septic children."

The mammalian cochlea achieves its outstanding performance characteristics by including a physiologically vul-
nerable active process that strategically ampliﬁes waves as they propagate through the cochlear spiral. As a
result of this spatially coordinated and nonlinear wave ampliﬁcation, the cochlear response at one characteristic-
frequency location largely depends upon the physiological status and the response in more basal regions. In
response to complex sounds, waves of different frequency nonlinearly interact along the cochlea, mutually sup-
pressing one with the other. In contrast to a bank of independently operating ﬁlters commonly used to depict
cochlear function, the responses of distinct “cochlear ﬁlters"" are strongly coupled by nonlinear wave interactions.
Although nonlinear wave interactions play a major role for the cochlea response, their role for encoding complex
sounds in the auditory periphery—and consequently their contribution to central auditory mechanisms—is poorly
understood and largely ignored.
 Understanding nonlinear wave interactions is hence essential to establish how the cochlea encodes eco-
logically relevant sounds and the role of the auditory periphery for sound perception. Because nonlinear wave
interactions depend upon the health of the ear, understanding these interactions is fundamental also to establish
how cochlear impairment affects the peripheral representation of complex sounds. Further, because even mild
sensorineural hearing loss greatly degrades behavioral performance in acoustically challenging situations, it is
likely that nonlinear wave interactions underlie unexplored mechanisms for the outstanding performance of the
healthy ear.
 My project will tackle these issues by: (i) deriving from the experimental data a cochlear model that reproduces
accurately nonlinear wave interactions in laboratory animals (Aim 1.a) and humans (Aim 1.b); (ii) testing the
hypothesis that nonlinear wave interactions underly beneﬁcial mechanisms to encode sounds in acoustically
adverse situations (Aim 2.a), and (iii) determining how and with what limitations the effects of nonlinear wave
interactions elucidated in this project are accounted for by popular computer models of the auditory periphery
(Aim 2.b). The results of this project will not only challenge and improve the current understanding of cochlear
function for hearing, but will also ﬁnd natural application in improving models of hearing impairment, and in
determining novel cochlear-inspired strategies to improve the performance of assistive hearing technology."

Current inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) therapeutic approaches are insufficient to maintain long-term immune
homeostasis and effectively recalibrate T helper cell imbalances in patients. There remains an unmet clinical
need for new strategies that sustain immune tolerance in IBD. The programmed death 1 (PD1) pathway has
emerged as a critical inhibitory signal which controls T cell responses and maintains immune homeostasis.
Altered PD1 signaling can predispose mice and humans to autoimmunity. For example, PD1 blockade can cause
colitis in mice and humans. Recently, we identified that Smad7, a major molecule implicated in IBD, sustains
intestinal inflammation in mice by limiting PD1 signaling, thereby dampening PD1-induced Tregs. Given the
critical role of PD1 in limiting tissue inflammation, PD1 represents a therapeutic target of high clinical interest.
We found that enhancing PD1 signaling via recombinant human PDL1-Fc or PDL2-Fc (PD1 agonist) promotes
de novo human Treg induction and stability. Interestingly, we also found that agonizing PD1 in myeloid cells
inhibits inflammatory cytokines that are known to promote Th1 and Th17 development and destabilize Tregs
during IBD. In our effort to identify factors that upregulate PD1, we found that IL-2 directly induces PD1 on human
T cells. Excitingly, we found that a combination of low-dose IL-2 with PD1 agonist synergistically promotes human
Tregs. Based on these findings, we will test our hypothesis that PD1 agonist monotherapy could effectively
restore immune tolerance by directly enhancing Treg homeostasis while quenching inflammatory T cell and
myeloid cell responses. We also hypothesize that combining low-dose IL-2, which induces PD1 on T cells, with
PDL1/2-Fc will synergistically boost Treg responses to better treat IBD. Because IL-2 can expand inflammatory
T cell and myeloid cell responses, combining PD1 agonist with low-dose IL-2 may also restrain this undesired
IL-2-induced inflammation. This is particularly exciting, since low-dose IL-2 for Treg induction has shown some
efficacy in currently advancing clinical trials in IBD and other contexts, and strategies to improve low-dose IL 2
therapy are being actively pursued.
In Aim 1, we will test the translational relevance of PD1 agonist monotherapy
and combination therapy with low-dose IL-2 by treating IBD patient T cells in vitro and T helper cell-specific PD1-
deficient (KO) mice with colitis. In Aim 2, we will test the translational relevance of PD1 agonist monotherapy
and combination therapy with low-dose IL-2 by treating IBD patient myeloid cells in vitro and myeloid cell-specific
PD1-deficient (KO) mice with colitis.
In Aim 3, we will test the translational relevance of PD1 agonist
monotherapy and combination therapy with low-dose IL-2 by treating translationally relevant humanized mice
with colitis. In summary, we will explore the efficacy of a never tested PD1 agonist/low-dose IL-2 combination
therapy strategy in IBD to address unanswered questions around how PD1 agonism promotes human immune
tolerance, the translational potential of PD1 agonist therapeutic strategies, and how to implement them in IBD."
10786985,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Breathing is a remarkable behavior fundamental to life that mediates gas exchange to support
metabolism and regulate pH. A reliable, non-stop, robust rhythmic pattern of respiratory muscle
activity is essential for breathing in mammals. Failure to maintain a normal breathing pattern in
humans suffering from sleep apnea, apnea of prematurity, congenital central hypoventilation
syndrome, hyperventilation syndrome, Rett syndrome, and perhaps Sudden Infant Death
Syndrome, leads to serious adverse health consequences, even death. Various neuro-
degenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, multiple systems atrophy, and
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, are associated with sleep disordered breathing that appear to
result from the loss of neurons in brain areas controlling breathing. If breathing is to be
understood in normal and in pathological conditions, the mechanisms for breathing central
pattern generation must be revealed. We focus on two brainstem sites essential for generation
of the normal breathing pattern, the preBötzinger Complex and the retrotrapezoid
nucleus/parafacial respiratory group. We propose a broad series of experiments both in vivo
and in vitro in rodents using state-of-the-art techniques to significantly advance our under-
standing of respiratory rhythm and pattern generation to provide an extraordinary window into
the mechanisms underlying the neural control of breathing. Such advancements will be
foundational for development of highly novel therapies for treating human diseases of breathing."
10791805,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
 Our lab discovered COPA syndrome, a monogenic autoimmune disorder that involves inflammation of
the lungs, joints and kidneys. We established a mouse model of COPA syndrome by generating CopaE241K/+
knock-in mice that spontaneously developed clinical and immunologic features of patients, including interstitial
lung disease (ILD) and increased levels of activated, cytokine-secreting T cells. We performed bone marrow
chimera and thymic transplant experiments to reveal that expression of mutant COPA in the thymic stroma is
sufficient to cause a defect in negative selection of CD4+ T cells. Our work revealed that a key step in the initiation
of disease in COPA syndrome is a breakdown in central tolerance. The goal of this grant is to unravel the
mechanisms by which mutant COPA causes impaired thymic tolerance.
 COPA syndrome presents in childhood with inflammatory arthritis of the small and large joints and lung
disease that manifests as pulmonary capillaritis or ILD. Patients develop clinical features that are observed in
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) including high-titer anti-nuclear antibodies, autoantibodies to double
stranded DNA and immune complex glomerulonephritis. In addition, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from all
COPA syndrome subjects exhibit a markedly elevated type I interferon stimulated gene signature, a hallmark of
SLE. We recently demonstrated that activation of type I interferon (IFN) signaling in COPA syndrome is caused
by constitutive activation of the innate immune adapter molecule STING, which is missorted at the Golgi by
mutant COPA. Mutant COPA-mediated STING activation upregulates IFNs in immune cells of CopaE241K/+ mice,
and remarkably, also within the thymic epithelium. Taken together, this suggests STING has a functional role in
the thymus with the potential to alter thymocyte selection and/or development. We hypothesize mutant COPA
breaks central tolerance by causing activation of STING in thymic epithelial cells (TEC).
 We will use our mouse model to determine how activated STING in thymic epithelial cells alters T cell
maturation and selection. We will define the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which mutant COPA impairs
autophagic flux and determine whether proteins missorted by mutant COPA are involved in STING-induced
autophagy. Finally, we will test whether small molecule STING agonists and inhibitors can fine-tune STING
signaling in the thymus to alter thymocyte development and selection. Taken together, our work provides new
insight into how activated STING in the thymus shapes the T cell repertoire to cause autoimmunity and
immune dysregulation. These findings have important implications for settings in which systemic inflammation
causes activation of STING in the thymic stroma including cancer therapy and infections."

About 1 in 59 children are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a
neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in social interaction and
communication. Our proposals in this grant are motivated by two studies on the two most
promising biobehavioral biomarker modalities of ASD, electroencephalography (EEG) and eye-
tracking (ET). Both studies collect data from serially administered EEG and ET tasks, over
multiple longitudinal visits. In addition, multiple tasks within or across modalities tap into similar
cognitive domains. Hence, even though joint analysis of these complex data structures across
tasks, modalities (EEG and ET) and longitudinal visits would lead to the most efficient use of the
available information, current analysis techniques are limited and are usually carried out on data
from one task at a time, within a modality. Therefore, we propose a comprehensive set of
statistical methods for the analysis of biobehavioral biomarker data in its entirety, borrowing
information from multiple tasks, across modalities and over longitudinal visits. Our proposal
relies on characterization of EEG and ET data as high-dimensional highly structured functional
objects. Different from existing multimodal brain imaging literature, which fuses data for brain-
region related inference, we combine a brain imaging modality (EEG) with a biobehavioral
marker (ET), based on information on tasks that are related to common cognitive domains. Our
unified framework strives to combine information across dimensions and experimental tasks to
provide meaningful ways of interpreting the gained information in lower dimensions. These
developments will provide the data science and biomedical community with novel instruments of
scientific investigation, including user friendly software, to assist medical and public health
decisions based on biobehavioral multimodal data.
Aims. We propose three specific aims: 1) (Task) To develop a feature allocation framework for
modeling the high-dimensional biobehavioral data across tasks within a modality; 2)
(Longitudinal) To extend the feature allocation modelling of Aim 1 to account for longitudinal
performance trends in the joint trajectories of data from multiple tasks of a biomarker within a
modality across longitudinal visits; 3) (Multimodal) To model the data in its entirety across
multimodal biomarkers. Proposals in each aim rely on dimension reduction through a feature
allocation framework in estimating a set of underlying low-dimensional cognitive domains.
Children are then clustered according to their loadings on multiple factors representing different
cognitive domains, contributing to the study of heterogeneity in ASD."
10791842,"ABSTRACT:
 Our ears are vulnerable to intense sounds (> 130 dB SPL) that can damage middle- and inner-ear
structures and produce temporary or permanent hearing loss. Prior research has focused on studying damage
to the cochlea, but relatively little is known of how the middle ear transmits extremely high-level damaging sounds
to the cochlea. While the middle ear muscle reflex elicited by high level steady state sounds can reduce sound
transmission to the cochlea, it cannot protect the ear during brief impulsive sounds. Nonlinear mechanisms of
the middle ear that can provide protection for impulsive sounds have been observed. However, there are few
quantitative studies of middle ear nonlinear processes, and the contributions of nonlinear mechanisms to the
frequency and level dependence of middle ear sound transfer are not well described. Furthermore, the etiologies
of middle ear structural failures produced by intense sounds are poorly known, as are their effects on middle ear
function. This lack of knowledge limits our ability to prevent such failures. There is also a lack of knowledge of
how surgically reconstructed middle ears with a passive prosthesis or graft work and their failure rate at high
level sounds. To tackle these questions, we propose three aims in this study. Aim 1 will use human cadaveric
temporal bones to systematically characterize middle ear nonlinear processes in time and frequency domains at
high intensity, in normal and reconstructed middle ears, to gain critical new knowledge on middle ear structure
and function at high sound levels. Aim 2 will extend the sound intensity to levels that can rupture the tympanic
membrane and other soft tissues to investigate the cause and time history of failures in normal and reconstructed
middle ears. For Aim 3, we propose to develop finite element middle ear nonlinear models that incorporate
multiple middle ear nonlinear mechanisms, including impulsive time-domain models and continuous tone
frequency-domain models. This study will impact our ability to predict noise-induced hearing damage,
development of new strategies for ear protection and improvements in the surgical repair of damaged middle
ears."
10791847,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Most humans are resistant to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and form granulomas that limit inflammatory
tissue damage. Nevertheless, tuberculosis (TB) remains a leading infectious cause of death globally because a
fraction of infected individuals develops massive necrotic granulomas and transmit Mtb via aerosols. This
outcome of Mtb infection is relatively uncommon among immunocompetent humans, and its mechanisms are
poorly characterized. We will study both host vulnerability (predisposition to necrotization of TB granulomas) and
Mtb virulence determinants (the necrosis-inducing factor) to determine how their interactions lead to necrosis in
susceptible but otherwise immunocompetent hosts.
 We will address this major knowledge gap using a well-characterized mouse model developed in our laboratory
that recapitulates the formation of organized human-like necrotic pulmonary TB granulomas (mice with the
susceptibility allele of the sst1(super-susceptibility to tuberculosis, sst1) locus) Our recent studies reveal that
inadequate antioxidant defense (AOD) drives an aberrant response of the sst1 mutant macrophages to TNF and
induce hyperactivity of type I interferon pathway (IFN-I). This mouse model also provides a unique opportunity
to study the role of a recently discovered Tuberculosis Necrotizing Toxin (TNT).
 The major premise of this application is that impaired stress resilience of macrophages due to inadequate
antioxidant defense (AOD) is exploited by Mtb to subvert local immunity within pulmonary TB granulomas of
immunocompetent hosts and induce necrosis. We will investigate: (i) Crosstalk of Myc and IFN-I pathways in the
deregulation of antioxidant response in activated macrophages. (ii) Host regulators of the anti-oxidant response
and necrosis in vivo. This aim will address our hypothesis about the hierarchy of the antioxidant defense and
IFN-I pathways in vivo and test whether boosting the antioxidant defense prevents the granuloma necrotization
and reduce the IFN-I hyperactivity. (iii) Role of the Mtb Tuberculosis Necrotizing Toxin (TNT) in driving necrosis
in TB granulomas of the susceptible but immunocompetent hosts.
 The ultimate goal of our studies is to develop mechanistic interventions to target necrosis in TB granulomas in
order to overcome a major obstacle to the sterilization of TB lesions with antibiotics. This will improve the
outcomes of TB chemotherapy and prevent the evolution and spread of drug resistant TB."
