10909917,"ABSTRACT – Biological Analysis Core
Cellular senescence is a prolonged and generally irreversible growth arrest observed in normal tissue
development. While senescence is vital for tissue remodeling, for prevention of malignancy in damaged cells,
and in wound healing, the aberrant accumulation of senescence cells is associated with multiple chronic
diseases of aging such as atherosclerosis, pulmonary fibrosis, neurodegeneration and others. Senescence is
seen as a response to various stressors including telomere erosion, genotoxicity, nutrient deprivation, hypoxia,
and mitochondrial dysfunction. The Biological Analysis Core, in partnership with the Biospecimen Core, will be
a critical resource for the SenNet proposal by integrating and delivering state-of-the-art technology to investigate
senescence at the molecular, single-cell, and whole tissue level. The core is led by a team of highly accomplished
research scientists who have successfully utilized these specific platforms in conjunction with previous and/or
current clinical studies. Together with the Data Analysis Core, the Biological Analysis Core will generate
multimodal atlases that characterize the heterogeneity and spatial distribution of senescent cells at single cell
resolution in various tissues including lung, heart, colon, muscle, and skin and across different stages of
development consisting of fetal/infant, pediatric (<18 years old), young adults (<35), middle adults (<55), and
older adults (>55). To support the consortium and provide the requisite set of senescence maps across different
tissues, Biological Analysis Core will utilize a comprehensive repertoire of highly standardized and/or formally
validated assay platforms. With the initial focus on lung tissue, we will systematically profile heart, muscle, skin
and colon tissues to provide rich tissue maps of senescence across all above-defined age groups. The Biological
Analysis Core has the following Specific Aims: 1) to provide high resolution state-of-the-art molecular, cellular,
and tissue-level characterization of biospecimens for the purpose of identifying robust biomarkers of senescence
and constructing detailed tissue maps, 2) to collect and analyze matching biofluids including blood, cerebrospinal
fluid, saliva, and urine, providing a broader interconnection between the senescence maps across multiple
tissues and at varying developmental stages, and 3) to develop human-derived microfluidic-based droplet
organoids from various tissues to model unique systems amenable to perturbations that test the efficacy of novel
drugs for senescence intervention. All of these samples, derivatives, and data will be available to the entire
Tissue Mapping Center consortium and our team will work to integrate and optimize all parts of the data
generation pipeline, from tissue collection and preservation to data generation, integration, analysis, and
interpretation."

Sialoglycans are sialic acid-containing oligosaccharides that play important biological roles in human biology and
pathology and are indispensable molecular probes for research related to bacterial and viral infection, cancer
metastasis, immune regulation, etc. The multifaceted functions of sialoglycans in human milk are also being
explored. Nevertheless, sialoglycan-related research and development of therapeutics and diagnostics have
been hampered by the limited access to these structurally complex compounds as well as the high cost and
special expertise needed for synthesizing and purifying these reagents.
 Among various synthetic strategies for producing sialoglycans, glycosyltransferase-based chemoenzymatic
methods are attractive strategies. An efficient method for synthesizing structurally defined sialoglycans is one-
pot multienzyme (OPME) chemoenzymatic strategy developed by Dr. Hai Yu and Dr. Xi Chen at UC Davis. Each
OPME glycosylation reaction contains a glycosyltransferase and enzymes involved in generating the
corresponding sugar nucleotide donor in situ from a simple monosaccharide. The OPME reactions allow the
synthesis of target glycans containing the desired glycosidic linkage with high regio- and stereo-specificity. At
the current stage, large-scale synthesis by the OPME systems is still limited by the scales and the yields of the
enzymes produced. In addition, OPME reaction conditions can be improved to decrease the amounts of enzymes
used for the synthesis. Product purification processes can also be streamlined using innovative strategies.
 To advance sialic acid-related research and therapeutic development, the goal of this proposed project is to
develop reagents, enzymes, and methods that are ready for commercialization to allow low-cost access to
sialoglycans of high demands and their underlying asialoglycans by the broad scientific community (both
academic and industry) and to enable highly efficient production of diverse biologically important special
sialoglycan targets by even nonspecialists. This will be achieved by the collaboration of the UC Davis team with
IMCS which has expertise in high-yield enzyme production by fermentation, unique lysis technique, commercial
infrastructure to manufacture, and product sale at affordable prices to the community."

 Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) result in significant morbidity and
healthcare costs, especially severe exacerbations that require hospitalization. Traditional bronchodilators and anti-
inflammatory medications, as well as programs to monitor and treat symptoms, have a modest effect on reducing
hospital admissions. Readmission rates remain unacceptably high, so alternative approaches are needed. In this
regard, pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is remarkably effective, and is associated with an 80% reduction in admission
rates. Successful completion of PR is also associated with substantial improvements in quality of life, dyspnea, as
well as exercise tolerance. Despite these benefits, recent studies have highlighted very poor referral rates for PR
overall and as low as 1.9% post-hospitalization, and non-completion rates as high as 60%. The poor adaptation of
PR in the community is due to a combination of barriers in availability and accessibility, as well as attrition. The
number of PR centers in the United States is inadequate, and these centers are mostly distributed in urban areas.
In addition, multiple socioeconomic and medical barriers hinder access to PR, and contribute to high drop-out rates.
 New strategies are needed to reduce hospital readmission in COPD, and to increase the delivery of PR to
underserved urban as well as rural areas in the community. Given the scarcities in existing resources, conventional
models of care delivery are being challenged, and attempts are being made to find alternative, cost-effective ways
of delivering healthcare to a larger number of eligible patients. To overcome the socioeconomic and physical
barriers to PR, we hypothesize that a video telehealth intervention that will deliver PR to the patient's home,
regardless of geographic location, will reduce hospital readmissions in COPD, and reduce respiratory morbidity. To
test our hypothesis we propose a prospective randomized controlled phase 3 multicenter clinical trial comparing a
real-time video telehealth PR intervention plus standard of care versus standard of care alone, with the following
Specific Aims: (1) To determine if a video telehealth PR intervention reduces 30-day all-cause readmissions in
patients hospitalized for acute exacerbation of COPD, (2) To evaluate the effects of the video telehealth PR
intervention on dyspnea and respiratory quality of life in COPD post hospital discharge, and (3) To evaluate the
cost-effectiveness of the telehealth intervention. Accomplishment of the aims of this study will result in a significant
reduction in COPD readmission rates, and a paradigm shift in the way PR is delivered to patients with COPD,
especially those that reside in remote and rural areas with limited access to pulmonary rehabilitation."
10911308,"Integrating Stochasticity into Biomolecular Mechanisms: A New Direction for
 Biomolecular Modeling
Abstract
It is increasingly apparent that kinetic selection plays an important role in biology. However, we are just beginning
to have the tools necessary to quantify, characterize and understand it. For biomolecular processes involving
multiple rare-event transitions, the canonical assumption is that mechanisms proceed following a consistent
order of transitions (following a single-pathway). However, increasing evidence from single molecule
experiments and biophysical measurements suggests that multiple pathways are not only possible, but essential.
The goal of the proposed research is to develop an experimentally-directed stochastic simulation
framework for mapping out mechanistic heterogeneity. As applications, I will focus, first, on secondary
active transport in the ClC Cl-/H+ antiporter and ATP hydrolysis driven translocation in several AAA+
ATPases, two processes involving chemical reactions and thus requiring multiscale methods that bridge
the quantum to classical realms.
The proposed approach to multiscale kinetic modeling is focused on multistep biomolecular transformations,
which makes it unique to many other domains of established kinetic modeling. Thus, new methods will be
developed and best practices from other domains will be adapted. It combines a bottom-up calculation of rate
coefficients for kinetically relevant transitions from multiscale simulations, with a top-down parameter refinement
based on experimental data. Innovation is proposed to refine the kinetic solution space with Bayesian parameter
estimation, global sensitivity analysis, uncertainty quantification, reaction path analysis and machine learning
methods. These methods will be used to better characterize the Cl-/H+ exchange mechanism in the ClC-ec1
antiporter in collaboration with Merritt Maduke (Stanford). The kinetic landscape for the wildtype system will be
studied to address the role of pathway heterogeneity, the origin of the non-integral 2.2:1 Cl-:H+ stoichiometry,
and the relevance of the alternating access mechanism.
Similar to secondary active transport, ATP-driven processes inherently involve multiple rate-influencing steps
(ATP binding, hydrolysis, Pi release, ADP release, and all of the associated conformational changes). A
multiscale reactive molecular dynamics method will be developed to describe ATP hydrolysis. Additionally,
enhanced free energy sampling will be used to characterize other transitions and multiscale kinetic models will
be developed to probe the role of kinetic selectivity and to test the controversial stochastic versus sequential
proposed mechanisms in AAA+ ATPases in collaboration with Chris Hill (University of Utah)."
10894161,"ABSTRACT
The primary goal of this MIRA R35 application is to understand the molecular basis and mechanisms by which
protein AMPylation regulates proteostasis in normal physiology and in the context of protein aggregation-
associated diseases. Protein AMPylation is conferred by dedicated AMPylases, which are present in a single
copy in most metazoans. These enzymes are increasingly recognized to control proteostasis, modulating how
and when amyloidogenic proteins – such as amyloid-β (Aβ), α-synuclein (α-Syn) and poly-glutamine repeat
proteins – aggregate. However, our knowledge of AMPylase regulation, target preference and their roles in
physiological as well as in disease states remains elusive. Closing these gaps in knowledge is key for gaining
fundamentally important insights into how post-translational protein AMPylation controls proteostasis, and will
potentially enable the development of therapeutic interventions that capitalize on this process. The goals of this
proposal are to 1) Dissect the mechanistic and physiological impact of FIC-1/FICD-mediated protein
AMPylation on proteostasis, and 2) elucidate the mechanistic basis of protein AMPylation in the cytoplasm and
nucleus. We will use a multi-faceted, translational and multi-organism approach to address the genetics and
biochemistry associated with these central questions in protein aggregation and proteostasis regulation. Our
research program is utilizing four complementary model systems: the nematode C. elegans, purified proteins
for in vitro biochemistry, human cell lines and in vivo mouse models, each offering its unique set of advantages
to examine protein AMPylation in the context of health and disease. We will leverage our unique in vivo and in
vitro assays and tools, while continuing to design novel approaches, to define the enzymes, targets, signaling
cascades and biological processes involved in AMPylation-mediated proteostasis regulation in unpreceded
details. In the next five years, our goal is to fully develop current projects and to devise new tools and
techniques to continuously produce genetic and mechanistic data with translational potential. A mechanistic
understanding of these processes will advance our knowledge of protein folding and proteostasis pathways
which will represent key steps towards the discovery of novel interventions to prevent or treat protein
aggregation-associated disorders."
10814999,"ABSTRACT: Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in
AIDS1. During AIDS and other immunosuppressive states, the absence of CD4 lymphocytic immunity results in
serious PJP 2,3. In addition to CD4 cells, organism clearance requires a balanced macrophage response since
excessive inflammation promotes lung injury and respiratory failure4. We have shown that polarization of AMs
toward M1 versus M2 type phenotype, leads to detrimental lung inflammation during Pneumocystis
pneumonia5. Corticosteroids given in addition to antibiotics significantly improves outcome during PJP 6.
However, concerns exist that corticosteroids further suppress immunity and increase co-infections 7,8. New
strategies to promote killing and clearance of Pneumocystis while balancing lung inflammation are required for
patients with PJP, particularly for those who are refractory to antibiotic therapy alone. Our prior studies have
shown that host innate immunity to Pneumocystis is mediated by C-Type Lectin Receptors (CLRs) on
macrophages and involves downstream CARD9 activation 9. We have further shown that the CARD9 can be
targeted by a novel specific small molecule inhibitor (BRD5529) that significantly reduces inflammatory
signaling in macrophages stimulated with Pneumocystis 10. CARD9 serves as the central intracellular molecule
through which Dectin-1, Dectin-2, Mincle, and other CLRs signal 11. Dectin-1 CLR is activated through its own
intracytoplasmic ITAM domain12, while other innate CLRs (e.g. Dectin-2 and Mincle) require interactions with a
common Fc-gamma receptor (FcγR) accessory chain to mediate responses to Pneumocystis 13,14. Strikingly,
we observed that mice double deficient in both Dectin-1 and Fcer1g (which lack the FcγR gamma chain)
demonstrated markedly reduced organism clearance compared to Card9-/- infected animals. These mice also
possess deficiencies in immunoglobulin (Ig) Fc receptors directly mediating antibody uptake responses, further
implicating altered humoral responses in Pneumocystis opsonization and killing. Thus, we hypothesize that
innate immune responses through the CLR-CARD9 axis, humoral activity, and macrophage
polarization act together to mediate effective responses resulting in optimal organism uptake, killing
and generation of host inflammatory responses. This hypothesis will be addressed through three
independent but interrelated Aims. In Aim #1. We will determine the relative roles of CLRs, CARD9, and FcRγ-
mediated mechanisms in Pneumocystis organism clearance and inflammatory responses in vitro. We will
study alveolar macrophages (AMs) and bone marrow-derived myeloid cells from wild-type, CARD9, and
Dectin-1/FcRγ deficient animals. In addition, we will also now include mice deficient in all activating (FcγRI,
FcγRIII, and
FcγRIV, termed
FcγRI/
FcγRIII/FcγRIV-/- mice) Fc receptors but retaining the functioning FcRγ
chain signal transduction subunit. We will further study uptake and killing of Pneumocystis and subsequent
cytokine release after organism challenge with and without PCP convalescent serum. Additionally, we will
study polarization kinetics of AMs toward M1 or M2 type phenotypes after stimulation with Pneumocystis.
Under Aim #2, we will determine the relative roles of CLRs, CARD9 and antibody-mediated mechanisms in
Pneumocystis clearance and inflammation in mouse models of PCP. Studies will be performed in wild-type,
CARD9, Dectin-1/FcRγ, and FcγRI/FcγRIII/FcγRIV-deficient mice. We will evaluate Pneumocystis clearance
and inflammatory responses in both immune competent and CD4-depleted immunocompromised mice with
PCP. Strikingly, our preliminary studies show that while CD4-depleted Clec7a-/- Fcer1g-/- (Dectin-1/FcRγ
deficient) mice show significantly greater organism burdens compared to Card9-/- animals, and both deficient
mouse lines showed dramatic decreases in proinflammatory cytokines compared to wild-types, but similar to
one another. Accordingly, we will examine the kinetics of CARD9 driven innate immunity and the additional role
of antibody-mediated responses during PCP in both CD4-depleted and immunocompetent mice. Finally, in
Aim 3, we will exploit the differences in the CLR innate and antibody-mediated response pathways to test novel
therapeutic strategies for adjuvant treatment of refractory PCP. While current anti-PJP strategies are usually
beneficial, patients with severe refractory PCP (~30% cases) still experience high mortality (80%)15,16. We will
employ combinations of adjuvant antibody interventions to promote Pneumocystis clearance, along with
CARD9 inhibition strategies to blunt excessive inflammation during infection. These strategies will be
investigated in CD4-depleted mice, which mimic the immune deficiencies present during AIDS. Better
understanding of these responses and the ability to target them alone or in combination will be used to test
novel adjuvant treatment strategies in mouse models of severe PCP."
10898070,"Project Summary/ Abstract
Background: The cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor that regulates physiologic
gastrointestinal digestive functions and growth of the gastrointestinal tract. CCK receptors become
overexpressed in gastrointestinal cancers where receptor activation by the ligands, CCK on or gastrin,
stimulate cancer growth and metastases. CCK receptors have also been described as fibroblasts. When
activated, these cells produce collagen-associated proteins that lead to fibrosis associated with malignancies
and are thought to impede the penetration of therapeutic agents.
Innovation: We recently showed that a diet high in saturated fat induces the expression of hepatic CCK- B
receptors in a murine model of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. The CCK receptor antagonist, proglumide,
reversed inflammation, fibrosis, and steatosis prevented the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in the
murine NASH model.
Long-term objectives: In this proposal, I plan to investigate the mechanisms of how CCK receptors mediate
hepatic inflammation and fibrosis and the role of CCK receptors in hepatocellular cancer.
Research Aims: In vitro studies will be performed to analyze the potential of cross-talk between CCK
receptors and chemokine receptors. The role of CCK receptors in regulating hepatic fibrosis in stellate cells will
be carried out in vitro using CRISPR technology to selectively knockout cancer cell CCK receptors and in vivo
with transgenic mice engineered to be null in the CCK-B receptor. Lastly, we will examine the novel idea of
whether liver injury and NASH induce proliferation of hepatic stem cells that express CCK-B receptors and
these stem cells are responsible for HCC.
Candidate's Goals: Are to understand the pathophysiology of CCK receptors in liver cancer development and
progression. This proposal will be completed under the guidance of an experienced mentor team that includes
accomplished tumor biologists, immunologists, and hepatology cancer researchers. To accomplish these
goals, the candidate will work with her mentors and constantly review research objectives for publication to
address candidate’s publication record and the Professional Development Office to follow a career
development plan by incorporating diverse methodologies for advancement, which includes manuscript
preparation, project management adhering to timelines, effectively managing a budget, attending and
presenting at national conferences and departmental seminars, mentoring graduate and undergraduate
students, and preparing application materials."
10924040,"The brain of an awake, mature human (and other mammals) consciously and subconsciously
“knows” the body’s configuration in 3D space on a moment-by-moment basis. This is often
referred to as the “body schema” representation in the brain. Body schema is critical for self-
awareness and for motor control. For example, we can effortlessly use our hand to touch our
nose or swat a mosquito that has just landed on the back of the neck, regardless of the starting
positions of the hand, because we have an intimate knowledge of the body’s position in 3D
space at any given moment. Yet how the brain generates body schema representation remains
largely unknown. Here we propose to systematically examining the neural circuits and
mechanisms that compute the 3D positions of all body segments (individually or combined) with
egocentric reference frames in the mouse brain. This is achieved by (1) developing an
algorithm, BodySchemeJ, that generates fully parameterized moment-to-moment description of
full body configurations in freely moving mice; (2) performing large-scale multi-electrode array
recordings from multiple brain areas with concurrent tracking of body configurations in free-
moving behaviors; (3) computational analysis of neural data and testing the hierarchical body
schema representation hypothesis; and (4) delineating the presynaptic inputs and output targets
of identified body schema cells. Finally, since body schema representation deficits are observed
in many neurological diseases, we will test how body schema is abnormally encoded in a
mouse model of autism. The pioneering knowledge gained from this research will help to
establish a new conceptual framework to advance our understandings of quintessential
neurobiological processes such as self/body awareness, localizing sensations to body parts in
3D space, action selection and motor control."
10890725,"Active surveillance (AS), which holds off on treatment for low-risk PCa patients until signs of progression are
detected through careful monitoring, was developed as a potential solution to decrease over-treatment of low-
risk cancer. For this BCC/BDL, we propose to develop multimodal biomarker panels and associated in vitro
diagnostic multivariate index assays (IVDMIAs) for two specific clinical intended uses to improve the
effectiveness of AS: 1) IVDMIAs using serum, urine, and biopsy tissue biomarkers to identify patients with low-
risk PCa from those with aggressive disease, and/or to provide accurate clinical grading and staging to assist in
AS enrollment; and 2) IVDMIAs of non-invasive (serum and urine) biomarkers to sensitively detect early signs of
disease reclassification with clinically meaningful lead time for definitive treatment. To develop these biomarker
panels, we propose four specific aims. Aim 1. To perform integrated proteomic and glycoproteomic
characterization of multimodal clinical specimens to discover and develop biomarkers de novo as well as
integrate biomarkers existing or from our current BDL/BRL for the two specific intended uses; Aim 2. To work
with the BRL component of our BCC to develop high-quality assays for accurate and efficient evaluation of
selected candidate biomarkers; Aim 3. (co-Aim with BRL) To develop and evaluate IVDMIAs to achieve clinically
meaningful performance characteristics for the predefined clinical uses; and Aim 4. To participate in EDRN
network research projects, including actively participating in and contributing to on-going and future network
projects, collaborate with other BCCs and CVCs, and work with EDRN leadership, Executive Committee, and
Data Management and Coordinating Center (DMCC) regarding research direction, data and results report
criteria/standards, and general effort coordination. Innovations of the BDL include unique targeted AS population,
state-of-the-art proteomic and glycoproteomic technologies for both biomarker discovery and pre-validation
phases, immunoassays for the detection of specific modified protein forms, quantitative analysis of tissue
proteins by single-cell analysis and immunohistochemistry staining as well as quantitative measurement using
liquid tissue measurement. Innovative bioinformatics approaches include tools that incorporate existing clinical
and biological knowledge of the disease into the quantitative analysis for discovery and IVDMIA model
optimization and corroborative analysis of the PCa proteome through single-cell analysis and bulk expression
data deconvolution. In summary, the proposed BCC/BDL has assembled a unique collection of well
characterized multimodal biospecimen collections representative of the intended targeted populations; and
proposed a clear path using state-of-the-art and innovative proteomics, glycoproteomics, statistics, and
bioinformatics approaches for biomarker discovery and validation of IVDMIAs to achieve clinically meaningful
performance for the two clearly defined intended clinical uses that are critically important for the success of
prostate cancer active surveillance."
10890730,"Our proposed EDRN BRL, which is located within the Clinical Chemistry Division (CCD) of the Johns Hopkins
Medical Institutions, will be an integral part of the BCC. The BRL will continue to serve as a network resource for
clinical and laboratory validation of biomarkers, which includes technological development and assay refinement,
as well as knowledge of quality management and regulatory requirements. Our laboratory is certified by CAP
and regulated by CLIA (certificates provided). We follow stringent GLP guidelines for quality control and quality
assurance. The proposed product developmental project of the BCC will be conducted at the JHU Center for
Biomarker Discovery and Translation (CBDT). The project goal is to validate prostate cancer biomarkers
discovered by our BDL & BRL during the current funding period, de novo discoveries from the BDL component
of the new BCC, and/or other potential biomarkers from within and outside EDRN using cutting edge technologies
in proteomics, bioinformatics, and clinical assay development. The proposed diagnostic products are in vitro
diagnostic multivariate index assays (IVDMIAs) consisting of a panel of biomarkers 1) to assist in the
preoperative assessment of PCa aggressiveness and decision for enrollment into active surveillance (AS); and
2) non-invasive biomarkers for the detection of rising risk of progression during AS to triage patients for additional
workup procedures for possible disease reclassification. We have assembled a strong team of research and
clinical scientists with many years of experience with cancer biomarkers and in technology development, study
design, bioinformatics, validation, and translation. Dr. Chan, the contact PI and the BRL PI, is the Director of
both CCD and CBDT. He has >30 years of experience in clinical chemistry and has conducted many (>75)
research studies funded by industry on cancer diagnostics leading to FDA approval for clinical use. Furthermore,
several leading scientists from the diagnostics industry will serve as collaborators to provide expertise and
facilitate product development and validation. Our BRL has been extremely productive. Since the inception of
the EDRN in 2000, eight EDRN developed assays have been approved by the FDA for clinical use and of these
eight, our BRL led the development of the OVA1 and Overa serum IVDMIAs for ovarian cancer, led the serum
proPSA validation study, and served as the reference lab for the urine PCA3 validation trial. In addition, Dr. Chan
was involved in the development of the MiCheck Prostate cancer test by Minomic International Ltd. This test was
licensed to a CLIA certified lab. In this application, we plan to continue our commitment to the EDRN mission
through network collaborations with BCCs, CVCs, and the DMCC. With this multi-disciplinary team of scientists
and clinicians, the BRL at JHU offers the best opportunity for the success of cancer biomarker validation and
translation. If the over-treatment, under-treatment and decrease in unnecessary biopsies in prostate cancer can
be successfully addressed, the morbidities associated with prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment can be
significantly decreased, while enhancing the detection and treatment of clinically significant prostate cancer."
10837146,"Project summary (OVERALL)
Lung cancer remains the leading cause of all cancer mortality. Improved imaging techniques enable the detection
of lung cancer at earlier stages, yet a large number of patients with non-malignant lung nodules are frequently
subjected to invasive diagnostic approaches. Even though surgical removal of early stage non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) is the most effective therapy, post-surgical recurrence of NSCLC remains a significant problem
as survival. Currently there are no clinically useful biomarkers that can accurately diagnose the indeterminate
nodule or identify those patients destined to have recurrence of cancer after successful surgical removal.
Recently, the use of culture-independent techniques to characterize the microbiome by us and others has led to
identification of microbial signatures associated with lung cancer diagnosis and prognosis among a cohort with
a wide range of disease stages. Preliminary metagenomic data obtained in collaboration with Micronoma using
blood samples of our NYU cohort have identified microbial signatures in systemic circulation associated with
early-stage NSCLC diagnosis. Further, using a NanoString platform we have identified circulating RNA
signatures predictive of early-stage NSCLC diagnosis. In addition, our preliminary data shows that lower airway
signatures can be used to predict prognosis post-surgical removal of early stage cancer. These data suggest
that microbial and host genomic signatures could be leveraged to develop useful biomarkers in early-stage
NSCLC. The addition of metabolite measurements could further contribute to this predictive power since those
are end products of microbial and host functions. Under this BCC application we will first identify top
microbial/host biomarkers that predict early-stage NSCLC diagnosis and prognosis using blood and lower airway
samples from a cohort of patients with lung nodules and a presumed surgical clinical Stage I (<3cm) but with a
final histological diagnosis of early-stage NSCLC (TNM  IIIA) or non-NSCLC nodules. We will implement cutting
edge bioinformatic approaches to identify the most promising targets from these unbiased omic approach
(metagenome, metabolome and transcriptome) which will guide the development of targeted approaches that to
be validated under the Biomarker Reference Laboratory. These targeted approaches will include the
development of targeted microbial DNA next generation sequencing, targeted metabolite measurement and
custom-made NanoString panels as CLIA level assays, internally and externally validated, that will identify
patients at highest risk for NSCLC diagnosis and recurrence after complete surgical resection."
10838577,"SUMMARY
 To meet the constant nutrient demand for fetal growth, maternal metabolism goes through a series of
adaptations during pregnancy. For regulating these metabolic adaptations, maternal islets progressively
produce significantly more insulin. Insufficient insulin production causes gestational diabetes mellitus and other
complications. The pancreatic α-cells are the second primary endocrine cells in islets. Although studies have
reported that pregnancy may increase α-cell mass and maternal blood glucagon concentrations, there is a
knowledge gap about the role of α-cells in controlling maternal metabolic adaptation. Our most recent study
discovered the essential role of α-cells in maternal insulin production during pregnancy. Besides glucagon, α-
cells also secret glucagon-like protein 1 (GLP-1). Similar to other metabolic stresses, our study showed that
intraislet GLP-1 contributes to α-cell-promoted insulin production during pregnancy. To further study the role of
intraislet GLP-1 in α-cell-promoted insulin secretion and how placental lactogen (PL) regulates α-cell
adaptation to pregnancy, our preliminary studies observed that GLP-1 reconstitution at a physiological level
improved but did not completely restore insulin production in some mouse models. These results suggest that,
in addition to GLP-1, additional mechanisms are involved in α-cell-regulated insulin production during
pregnancy. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are produced from almost all cells. By transferring the bioactive cargos
into the recipient cells, EVs serve as a channel for intercellular and intra-organ communication. Our preliminary
study not only identified α-cell-derived EVs (α-EVs), but showed that α-EVs promote insulin secretion.
Therefore, we hypothesize that the α-EVs play an important role in mediating the regulatory effects of
pancreatic α-cells on insulin production during pregnancy.
We will use pregnant mice with mGFP-labeled α-
cells to study pregnancy-induced dynamic changes in α-EVs production. The differential profiles of micro-RNA
in α-EVs will also be determined. Mouse models with α cell-specific prolactin receptor (Prlr) gene knockout will
be employed to verify the role of PL/PRLR in regulating α-EVs production and α-cell adaptation to pregnancy.
We will use the islets and purified α-EVs from the genetic mouse models to clarify the role of α-EVs in α-cell-
regulated insulin secretion during pregnancy. Together, the success of this project will reveal a new underlying
mechanism of maternal metabolic adaptation."
10837718,"Abstract
 High image noise degrades the diagnostic efficacy and quantitative accuracy of PET, as noise could easily
results in overestimation of SUV and cause false positive lesion detections in diagnosis. High image noise also
decreases the confidence of clinical decision making, leading to additional unnecessary follow-ups through other
imaging modalities and invasive procedure. Deep learning-based noise reduction has shown promises for PET
imaging. However, existing approaches only focus on converting low-count image (e.g. acquired through low-
dose injection or shorter scan time) to standard-count image in typical clinical scans. However, for both low-
count and the vast majority of routinely acquired clinical PET images with normal dose and scan time, there is
no approach to convert such clinical images to high-count images to further reduce the image noise, mainly due
to the challenge of obtaining high-count PET images as training labels. Another challenge in the real-world
application is to match the training data with the testing data, in terms of noise level, noise structure,
reconstruction parameters, scanner model, etc. Such matching is particularly challenging in a multi-center multi-
scanner setting. In this Academic-Industrial Partnership R01 project, we formed an ideal partnership between
Visage Imaging, a leading PACS company, and three leading academic centers (Yale, MGH, UC Davis) to
develop, evaluate, deploy, and translate robust deep learning methods to generate virtual-high-count PET
images in a highly personalized manner by taking into account the noise level of each organ in each patient, as
well as associated non-imaging patient information. The academic sites have access to a large number of high-
count data that are acquired either through long dynamic scans (at least 90 minutes) or by the ultra-sensitive
long axial field-of-view (FOV) Explorer scanner. The developed product would be deep learning networks that
can convert any clinical PET images data from all major vendors (Siemens, GE, United Imaging Healthcare
(UIH)) into virtual-high-count ultra-low noise images. Since Yale, MGH, and UC Davis are all serviced by Visage
Imaging, the developed deep learning technique can be seamlessly translated into Visage PACS
research/clinical servers for validation and evaluation, beta testing and user feedback, and ultimate translation
and regulatory filings. In Aim 1, we will develop deep learning models for virtual-high-count PET generation. In
Aim 2, we will evaluate and deploy the models into Visage research PACS server and evaluate virtual-high-count
PET in clinical environments. In Aim 3, we will integrate the developed virtual-high-count PET deep learning
models into the clinical production PACS server and generate regulatory documents and supporting data for
FDA 510(k)."

Vitamin A is an essential nutrient for all mammals. Many biological processes, including and foremost vision, are
crucially dependent on its adequate supply for proper function. Alterations of vitamin A metabolism can result in
a wide spectrum of ocular defects and lead to blindness. Retinol (vitamin A alcohol) is the predominant circulating
vitamin A form in the fasting state. In times of need (i.e. in the absence of dietary vitamin A intake), in order to
distribute vitamin A to the target peripheral tissues, retinol is released in the bloodstream from the liver, the main
body storage site of the vitamin, bound to retinol-binding protein (RBP). Inside the cells, retinol binds specific
intracellular carriers, namely cellular retinol-binding proteins, and it serves as a precursor for the active vitamin
A forms: retinaldehyde, critical for vision, and retinoic acid, the ligand for specific nuclear receptors that regulate
the transcription of hundreds of target genes. How retinol is released from the retinol-RBP complex and
internalized by the cell has been subject of debate for decades. STRA6, the putative plasma membrane receptor
for RBP, was identified in 2007.
We first determined the structure of STRA6, from Danio rerio reconstituted in amphipol, by single-particle cryo-
electron microscopy to 3.9 Å resolution. Our structure revealed a possible mechanism for retinol to transition
from RBP across the membrane, in a STRA6-mediated manner. It also showed an unexpected association of
STRA6 with calmodulin, setting forth the hypothesis of a correlation between retinol metabolism and calcium
homeostasis, which we investigated in a biophysical and cellular context. Here we propose to understand how
the system works mechanistically at a molecular level. In particular, we aim to investigate how RBP and STRA6
interact to mediate retinol exchange, the role the membrane plays in the process, and how the entire process is
impacted by varying calcium levels. To do so, we plan to adopt an integrated approach comprising structural
biology, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, biophysical experiments and retinol-uptake assays. We will
switch to a mammalian system so as to better correlate our results with cell-based observations, and to perform
structural experiments in the close to native environment of a lipid-filled nanodisc.
In support of the proposed experiments, we present preliminary data on the structure of a mammalian STRA6
both in the apo form and in complex with RBP, on the MD simulations focusing on the molecular-detailed
mechanistic aspects of the release of retinol from RBP into STRA6, and from STRA6 into the membrane, and
evidence that all the biophysical and biochemical assays we will utilize are in place. The multifaceted, synergistic
mechanistic studies we propose to carry out in this application will enable detailed structure-based understanding
of STRA6-mediated retinol uptake. This is a process of extreme importance, in particular in organs such as the
eye, that rely on tight control of retinol levels for proper physiological function."

Prokaryotes can acquire resistance to viruses and plasmids by integrating short fragments of
foreign DNA, called prespacers, into clusters of regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats
(CRISPR's). These repeats are then transcribed and processed into small guide RNA's that are
used to direct the destruction of foreign nucleic acid. This mechanism has many parallels with
eukaryotic RNA interference but the proteins that are associated with the CRISPR response are
evolutionarily unrelated to their eukaryotic counterparts. Our long-term goal is to understand the
biochemical and structural basis of CRISPR-mediated resistance in prokaryotes. The objectives
here are to understand how changes in the target sequence modulate the immune response
and provide insight into how the prespacers are incorporated into CRISPR arrays. Our
objectives will combine structural, biochemical and cell based experiments. Successful
completion of the proposed studies is significant because it will increase our understanding of
bacterial resistance to viruses and plasmids, both of which play important roles in the genetics
of pathogenic bacteria. It is also significant because these studies will help in the further
development of CRISPR-based tools."
10875488,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening condition featuring acute onset of non-
cardiogenic respiratory failure and hypoxemia. Consequently, patients with ARDS have severe hypoxemia due
to a significant impairment of gas exchange, and the goal of supportive therapy is to prevent critical tissue
hypoxia, which can cause acute cardiac arrest and death or have long-term neurologic consequences for
survivors. ARDS affects almost 200,000 individuals annually in the US, leading to >3.5 million hospital days and
nearly 75,000 deaths. Despite developments in our understanding of protective ventilation strategies and modern
advanced life support techniques, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), mortality associated
with ARDS remains unacceptably high and has not improved appreciably in two decades. Indeed, the mainstay
of supportive therapy in the ICU includes improving arterial oxygen (O2) saturation by introducing supplemental
O2 and supporting respiration with mechanical ventilation, but there are limits to the capacity of such measures
to benefit patients. In fact, exposure to a high fraction of O2 may actually increase risk for mortality in critically ill
patients. Similarly, excessive distention from mechanical ventilation can exacerbate acute lung injury, although
the goal of protective lung ventilation is simply to offer mechanical support without inducing harm. Hence,
maximal therapy with supplemental O2 and mechanical ventilation is often not sufficient to sustain life until the
lungs recover. We propose a novel, paradigm shifting therapeutic strategy using a small molecule drug to
enhance supportive care measures and potentially limit the morbidity and mortality of ARDS. Our therapeutic
candidate, VZHE-039.glycine salt, a water-soluble synthetic analog of the natural aromatic aldehyde vanillin, is
a highly potent allosteric modifier of hemoglobin (Hb) that demonstrated its ability to rapidly and potently increase
the capacity of Hb to bind and transport O2 when administered intravenously to pigs. The aromatic aldehyde
constituent of VZHE-039 forms reversible Schiff-base interactions with N-terminal valine amines in the α-cleft of
Hb to allosterically modify Hb by stabilizing its high O2-affinity state. The result is a rapid, pharmacologic shift in
Hb O2 affinity, which can increase the margin of safety to prevent acute desaturation and limit the need for more
invasive mechanical ventilation or additional supplemental O2. This novel approach also has the potential to
delay or even prevent the need for emergent salvage with ECMO. Our goal is to provide definitive evidence of
the potential of this approach by assessing its efficacy in a LPS endotoxin model of severe ARDS in pigs.
Following promising results in our Phase I study demonstrating highly reproducible and dose-dependent
pharmacodynamics achieving shifts in hemoglobin oxygen affinity, a definitive efficacy study in a high fidelity
large animal model would support advancement into a human clinical trial."
10861770,"Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neo), is one of the most significant fungal pathogens worldwide.
However, much is still unknown on how it interacts with the host to evade and subvert the immune response.
Here we propose to study the biological effects of intercepting the trehalose sugar biosynthetic pathway, which
our data suggest affects interactions of cryptococcus with multiple lines of host defenses and could serve as an
“Achilles heel” for the fungus. Trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS1) catalyzes the first step in the
biosynthetic pathway to generate trehalose, a disaccharide that canonically protects C. neo (and other
microbes) against stress, which is not synthesized or required by mammalian cells. TPS1 has been described
as a virulence factor for C. neo in multiple animal infection models, but the mechanistic underpinnings are
undefined. We propose to mechanistically uncover how TPS1-deletion alters fungal-host interactions to drive
this increased fungal control.
 Our preliminary data show that in murine models of pulmonary infection, trehalose-deficient C. neo
(tps1Δ) is very rapidly cleared due to improved immune protection. As such, we hypothesize that cryptococcal
TPS1 is required to protect the fungus against all 3 lines of pulmonary host defenses via (1) interference with
the local resident defenses; (2) the recruitment/activation of the innate immune cells for early fungal control,
and (3) modulation of the adaptive memory responses. We propose that trehalose is required to protect C. neo
against innate factors in the alveolar space, such as surfactants. Our preliminary data support a role for the
surfactant proteins A and D in trehalose-deficient C. neo control (Aim 1). We also propose that the loss of
trehalose facilitates rapid fungal clearance by resident innate immune cells, specifically neutrophils (Aim2).
Further, our preliminary data suggest that the loss of Tps1-function by Cryptococcus results in an
immunostimulation that supports the development of protective skewing and an adaptive immune memory
response (Aim 3). This improved the level of immunoprotection supports that targeting the TPS pathway, apart
from directly aiding the fungal removal, can induce long-term protective immune memory effects. Eventually,
understanding how trehalose alters cryptococcal interactions with host defenses could support the
development of a future class of broad antifungal inhibitors that could aid the treatment of multiple types of
fungal infections. In summary, this work will provide novel context for how C. neo avoids pulmonary
host defenses and how these interactions can be exploited.
 The studies proposed above make up the scientific basis for the VA CDA-2 program that will provide
training and career development for Dr. Kristie Goughenour into an independent VA investigator. Dr.
Goughenour completes the third year of her postdoctoral training in the Multidisciplinary T32 Research Training
Program in Lung Disease. Her primary research focus is on host-pathogen interactions of pathogenic fungi in
pulmonary infections. Her training has provided her with both the technical ability and theoretical framework to
dissect both the human host factors and the microbial virulence mechanisms that interact to determine the
outcomes of infections. This proposal builds upon her skills in molecular mechanisms of fungal pathogenesis
and host responses to fungal pathogens to combine into unique expertise in host immune control of pulmonary
fungal pathogens and novel mechanisms of fungal immune evasion. Dr. Goughenour will strengthen her
expertise in different aspects of immune processes and learn several new technologies. Her mentoring team of
5 top experts in their respective fields has been carefully developed to provide expertise and career support

ABSTRACT
The Functional Genomics and Proteomics (FG&P) Core supports research that increases our understanding of
how biological function (e.g., vision) arises from the information encoded in an organism's genome. The Core
provides support for the design, execution, and analysis of molecular, biochemical, proteomic, and phenotypic
experiments in six sections: DNA/RNA services, protein/small molecule analysis, cell culture, ocular/vision
structural and functional analysis, rodent ocular microsurgery, and mouse colony services. This support comes
largely via the expertise and services of Core personnel, the availability of equipment, supplies, and other
Core-dedicated resources, and their training of individuals from laboratories of the Atlanta Vision Research
Community (AVRC; Emory University, Georgia Tech, Morehouse School of Medicine, Atlanta VA Healthcare
System, and Georgia State University). The FG&P Core provides this support for AVRC investigators who are
NEI R01-funded but who cannot justify such services or equipment independently in a single R01-funded
project or who are not experts in FG&P techniques. By removing “barriers of entry” that are caused by lack of
experience with or lack of access to specialized approaches and equipment, the FG&P Core helps these
investigators increase the impact of their research. This support also enhances collaborations across the
AVRC by providing uniformity in methodologies supported by the above sections and equal access across

every AVRC investigator. Under their leadership, no AVRC investigator lacks Core support."
10701859,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - Administrative Core
Concussion is a form of traumatic brain injury that affects millions annually, particularly adolescents. While
many recover, a large number of injured youth go on to develop persistent post-concussive symptoms (PPCS),
and experience ongoing pain, dysfunction and disability. Due to the variability of concussion and the subjective
nature of post-concussive symptoms, our ability to predict and classify those who develop PPCS is currently
very limited. Research suggests that specific patterns of PPCS may be linked to different underlying
pathophysiology. The primary goal of the CARE4Kids Center Without Walls (CWOW) is to identify measurable
biological markers (blood tests, brain scans, electrical activity, etc.) that will help objectively predict and define
different categories of PPCS. The primary goal of the CARE4Kids CWOW Administrative Core is to
provide the necessary leadership, organization, training and infrastructure to permit efficient
coordination of 6 clinical data collection sites with designated centers able to provide quality control
and maintain and store data. The Administrative Core will provide training and oversight for all data collection
of clinical and biological measures. Biological measures may include cognitive tests, brain electrical activity,
scans of brain structure, molecules in blood or saliva, cardiovascular testing and stress responses. The
Administrative Core also will establish guidelines for the CARE4Kids CWOW to monitor funding, scientific
inquiry, data curation and sharing, and dissemination of results. Other important roles include standardizing
definitions, developing consistent methods and coordinating an annual meeting to ensure the consortium has
an open forum to meet, share information and troubleshoot unanticipated challenges. The results of this work
will lead to improved, but objective, medical tests that help predict which patients with concussions are at
greatest risk for PPCS. By defining objective categories of those at risk for PPCS, it will be possible to better
provide medical care, and will also lead to future trials for new treatments."
10701860,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT – Data Coordinating Core
Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) including concussion is a pressing public health issue for children in the United
States. In 2013, there were approximately 640,000 TBI-related emergency department visits among children
under 15 years alone. Concussions occurring in youth affect a greater number of individuals than concussions
in adults, and the distal impact of these concussions occurs over a greater number of years. Understanding
youth concussion in order to mitigate the impact of these injuries on the life span is a critical yet understudied
priority. Of particular importance are early and middle adolescents (EMA) who experience persistent post-
concussive symptoms (PPCS). PPCS as defined for this proposal refers to post-concussive symptoms (PCS)
lasting at least three months. While a minority of the mTBI population, these youth account for the majority of
morbidity, disability, and educational- and health-related costs. To better understand time to recovery, current
treatments, and the impact of PPCS, the Four Corners Youth Consortium (4CYC) has created a registry of
children and adolescents reporting to specialty clinics for concussion symptoms. Utilizing common data elements
(CDEs) from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), the 4CYC Concussion Registry
captures participants' demographic and clinical data as well as functional assessments. The Data Coordinating
Core (DCC) at the University of Utah has served as the Data Coordinating Center for the 4CYC Concussion
Registry, making it uniquely suited to serve as the DCC in the current proposal. The median time between injury
and clinic visit is 16 days with an interquartile range of 8 to 28 days suggesting this is an effective method to use
for this proposal to study children suffering from PPCS. While clinical factors and assessments are useful for
identifying PPCS, a need exists to understand the biological mechanisms underlying this outcome. Biomarkers
such as blood protein levels, neuroimaging, and oculomotor function may help assess concussion symptoms
and degrees of recovery. To support these aims, the CARE4Kids DCC proposes the following 3 aims: Specific
Aim 1. To provide assistance in protocol design, study implementation and management, data collection and
management, efficient quality monitoring, study reporting and metrics to ensure uniform collection of blood
specimens, imaging, and clinical data across the CARE4Kids sites. Specific Aim 2. To provide logistical support
and technical expertise to coordinate the collection and storage of blood specimens at BioSEND and ensure the
adherence to the data quality and sharing requirements related to FITBIR submissions. Specific Aim 3. To
provide biostatistical leadership and expertise to support the analytical goals of the CARE4Kids Research Cores
and project. Successful implementation of these aims will result in a public resource connecting standardized
data, biospecimens, and images as well as a new risk stratification and prediction tool for PPCS among
concussed EMA."
10877778,"ABSTRACT
The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the development of effective vaccines and therapeutic antibodies
will benefit from careful evaluation of the full range of potentially protective or harmful antiviral antibody
responses throughout all stages of preclinical testing. Small animal models are often used to assess antibody-
based interventions to provide sterilizing immunity, but these models may also hold value for studying
pathology and mechanisms of protection beyond neutralization. At present, ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) and
Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) are thought to be good small-animal models for diverse respiratory
pathogens as both support infection, manifest disease, and transmit virus. To optimally use these models,
there is a critical need to understand the suitability and/or shortfalls of ferrets and hamsters in recapitulating
antibody effector functions that affect human clinical outcomes—requiring basic research into the genetic
diversity, expression patterns, and functional profiles of both antibodies as well as Fc receptors in these
animals. The goal of this project is to perform initial biophysical and functional Fc and FcR profiling in ferrets
and Syrian hamsters to elucidate key variables that impact species-specific Fc-FcR-dependent effector
functions. Achieving this goal is a prerequisite for optimal translation of insights gained from emerging
protective and therapeutic small-animal studies to the clinic and to best prioritize strategies for human clinical
trials. Guided by strong preliminary data, and using a combination of gold-standard and state-of-the art
approaches, the project goal will be achieved though completion of two Specific Aims: 1) Define the
biophysical interactions between FcR and IgG that determine effector functions in ferrets and Syrian
hamsters, 2) Develop novel cell lines and assays for evaluating ferret and hamster Fc-mediated antibody
effector functions in vitro. The data and results obtained by completing the aims of this proposal will be
significant and innovative because they will generate knowledge that will identify the antibody and FcR
interactions capable of tuning immune response towards potent antiviral activity versus promoting pathological
inflammation in ferrets and hamsters. This knowledge will provide a roadmap for effective translation of studies
performed in these small animals, often used to model respiratory pathogens, to outcomes in human trials."

Clinical studies have consistently shown a strong association between aging and increased risk for intracranial
aneurysm rupture. Aging has traditionally been considered a non-modifiable risk factor. However, it is
becoming evident that some of the biological changes associated with aging can be modifiable or partially
reversible. Thus, pharmacological therapies targeting age-related biological events may be utilized to prevent
aneurysmal rupture.
Aging induces diverse changes in cellular homeostasis. One of the hallmarks of aging is cellular senescence, a
state of permanent proliferative arrest. Senescent cells secrete pro-inflammatory and tissue remodeling
cytokines collectively called the ""Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype"" (SASP). In addition to aging,
cellular stresses induced by inflammation, reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial dysfunction, and
hemodynamic stresses cause ""premature, pathological senescence"" in both young and aged individuals. Thus,
we hypothesize that excessive senescent cell burden collectively caused by age-related and premature
senescence may promote aneurysmal rupture through SASP-induced inflammation, tissue remodeling, and
tissue damage. We will test whether the elimination of senescent cells prevents aneurysmal rupture. In
addition, we will identify a rupture-promoting SASP profile using a proteomic approach.
Aim 1 is to test whether aging promotes aneurysm rupture while increasing the total senescent cell burden.
Using a mouse of aneurysm, we will establish the link between aging and the promotion of aneurysm rupture in
both sexes. We will also assess potential sex differences in senescence and their contributions to aneurysm
rupture. Aim 2 is to test whether cellular senescence promotes aneurysm rupture. We utilize pharmacological
and transgene-mediated “senolytic” approaches to establish the causal link between cellular senescence and
aneurysm rupture. We will employ (2a) a prototypical senolytic drug, ABT263 and (2b) transgene-mediated
senolysis of p16-3MR mice. In addition, we will assess the relative contribution between age-related
senescence and stress-induced premature senescence. Aim 3 is to identify rupture-promoting SASP profile
and establish a screening platform for future studies. 3a. By applying proteomics to the cerebral arteries from
Aims 1 and 2, we will identify a rupture-promoting SASP profile. 3b. We will identify the cell type that produces
rupture-promoting SASPs. Using the data from 3a and 3b, we will establish an ""in vitro to in vivo"" screening
platform for testing existing senolytics and senomorphs. 3c. We will validate the screening platform and key
rupture-promoting SASPs.
This proposal seeks to establish the causal links between aging, senescence, and aneurysmal rupture. The
screening platform developed in this proposal will be used to test existing senolytics and senomorphs for
preventing aneurysmal rupture in future studies."

 Neuroinflammation after stroke significantly contributes to neuronal damage and neurological impairment.
Delayed cell death in the ischemic penumbra is associated with glial activation and recruitment and infiltration of
peripheral immune cells to the brain. This is triggered by the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and
chemokines, contributing to cell death and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability after stroke. Dying cells in the
penumbra also release pro-inflammatory signals and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that
activate resident microglia toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype, thus further contributing to brain injury. Our
overall goal is to reduce the spread of stroke damage by limiting neuroinflammation.
 Receptor interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 2 (RIPK2) is a critical mediator of inflammation via its
activation of multiple pro-inflammatory and cell death pathways. Inhibition of RIPK2’s kinase activity abolishes
its signaling to alleviate inflammatory conditions in the periphery. The role of RIPK2 in ischemic stroke remains
unexplored; however, our pilot data shows a substantial reduction in infarct size and improvement in post-stroke
functional outcomes, both acutely and long-term, in Ripk2 knockout (Ripk2-/-) mice compared to wild-type
(Ripk2+/+) mice. We propose that RIPK2 is an essential initiator and propagator of pro-inflammatory pathways in
ischemic stroke. Our main objective is to attenuate its activity and assess the specific role of RIPK2 in vivo as it
relates to stroke pathology. We hypothesize that RIPK2 signaling is detrimental in ischemic stroke, and RIPK2
degradation/inhibition or selective ablation in myeloid cells will improve outcomes.
 Aim 1 will determine the neuroprotective effect of RIPK2 blockade after ischemia using a highly selective
RIPK2 inhibitor and a proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) that specifically degrades RIPK2 in vivo. We will
utilize aged mice of both sexes subjected to ischemic stroke and investigate the effects of RIPK2 blockade on
infarct size and long-term behavioral outcomes. In Aim 2, we will determine the impact of RIPK2 blockade on
stroke-induced neuroinflammation and investigate neuroprotection mechanisms. In Aim 3, we will dissect the
cell-specific role of RIPK2 in the neuroinflammatory process after stroke by using Ripk2 floxed mice crossed with
lines producing Cre recombinase in specific cell types. We will study the contribution of RIPK2 from myeloid-
lineage cells and brain-resident microglia to stroke injury. This project will leverage our expertise and unique
tools (Ripk2 floxed mice, PROTAC, and selective inhibitors) to understand the mechanisms of RIPK2-driven
inflammation in the context of ischemic stroke. This research may lead to identifying RIPK2 as a new therapeutic
target to block neuroinflammation and promote neuronal survival in the aftermath of an ischemic stroke."

 Autophagy is a highly conserved, primarily degradative pathway defined by the growth of a cup-shaped
membrane that envelopes and delivers cytosolic cargo (such as bacteria) to the lysosome for degradation.
Legionella pneumophila is a species of facultative intracellular bacteria that secretes over 300 effector proteins
that subvert host pathways such as the degradative endosomal and autophagy pathways to promote
intracellular survival. Legionella lacking currently known autophagy-inhibiting effectors are still capable of
evading this pathway, indicating that there are additional, undiscovered autophagy-inhibiting effectors. Taking
advantage of the highly conserved nature of this pathway, a recent screen identified several Legionella
effectors that blocked autophagy in yeast. One of those effectors, Lem26, was confirmed to inhibit autophagy
in mammalian cells. With the central hypothesis that Lem26 inhibits autophagy to prevent the capture
and lysosomal degradation of Legionella, the proposed research is designed to identify the mechanism by
which Lem26 inhibits autophagy (Aim 1) and determine its physiological relevance in the context of infection
(Aim 2). To discover the mechanism by which Lem26 inhibits autophagy, Aim 1 utilizes both an unbiased mass
spectrometry-based approach to identify the host targets of Lem26 as well as targeted experimentation on
putative targets based on epistasis data identifying the autophagic step inhibited by Lem26. To determine the
physiological relevance of Lem26 in the context of infection, Aim 2 utilizes multiple approaches to identify the
localization and interactome of bacterially translocated Lem26 as well as assess the impact of Lem26 on the
progression of autophagy and the intracellular growth of Legionella. The research and training plans laid out in
this proposal will be executed in a highly collaborative environment that is suited for the development of the
critical thinking skills and technical expertise required for a future research group leader. Given the broad
implication of autophagy in various diseases and the common virulence strategies employed by intracellular
pathogens, this proposed work will have broad implications in human disease."

Poor gait quality in chronic low back pain (cLBP) contributes to decreased mobility and functional decline. Those
with cLBP and pain-related psychological factors (e.g., fear-avoidance, pain catastrophizing) are at elevated risk
for these poor clinical outcomes. However, the relationships between fear-avoidance/pain catastrophizing and
gait quality in cLBP remain unknown, largely due to use of inconsistent gait quality metrics in small samples. To
improve clinical outcomes in this at-risk population, there is a critical need to 1) examine relationships between
fear-avoidance/pain catastrophizing and gait quality using rigorous metrics, and 2) conduct a mechanistic
exploration of contributors to gait quality impairments. As a first step toward the long-term goal of improving
physical therapy interventions for cLBP, the overall objective of this proposal is to 1) determine the relationship
between fear-avoidance/pain catastrophizing and gait quality, and 2) test the contribution of attention on gait
quality in those with heightened fear-avoidance/pain catastrophizing. The rationale is that establishing the ways
in which fear-avoidance/pain catastrophizing are related to gait quality may lead to new treatment interventions
(e.g., cognitive reframing surrounding movement, attention-shifting strategies) to improve clinical outcomes in
this high-risk population. The central hypothesis is that 1) fear-avoidance/pain catastrophizing is associated with
worse gait quality, and 2) reduced attention capacity associated with fear/catastrophizing contributes to poor gait
quality. Aim 1 is to determine the relationship between fear-avoidance/pain catastrophizing and gait quality in
cLBP. Aim 2 is to determine the role of attention in the relationship between fear-avoidance/pain catastrophizing
and gait quality. Under Aim 1, accelerometry-based gait quality metrics will be derived from a large, existing raw
data set (n=500) collected as part of an ongoing grant (1U19AR076725-01). For Aim 2, 50 participants will be
recruited to perform a dual-task assessing the impact of attention on gait quality. The proposed project is
significant because it uses rigorous, accelerometry-based metrics to examine relationships between fear-
avoidance/pain catastrophizing and gait quality, and it is the first and necessary step toward identification of
novel treatment targets (i.e., fear, attention-related deficits) that when prioritized in physical therapy, may improve
outcomes in this population. Under this fellowship, the applicant will gain unique opportunities for integration of
top-tier research and clinical training through University of Pittsburgh’s DPT/PhD in Bioengineering program.
The proposed project will be completed within the University of Pittsburgh NIH-funded BACPAC Consortium
Mechanistic Research Center, where the trainee will have unrivaled access to experts across the country,
recruitment and biostatistical support, and novel infrastructure to advance her toward a career as an independent
clinician-scientist. A mentorship team consisting of experts in chronic low back pain, gait, attention, translational
research, and pain psychology will support the applicant’s training goals in research methods/design, gait
accelerometry, human movement, professional development, and mentorship."
10834068,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Maladaptive associative learning underlies the persistent conditioned responses to previously neutral stimuli
seen in PTSD and addiction: cues present during the traumatic event result in fear responses in PTSD, and cues
that precede rewarding stimuli (such as alcohol or food) lead to reward seeking behavior in addiction. These
responses can be attenuated through extinction learning, where cues are repeatedly presented without the
previously learned fearful or rewarding outcome. Extinction memories are thought to compete for expression
with the original associative memory of the cue and subsequent fearful or rewarding outcome, meaning
conditioned responses may return with the passage of time, stress, or change in context (Bouton, 2004).
Individual differences in return of conditioned behavior after extinction have been observed in both the laboratory
and the clinic (Bush et al., 2007; Clapp et al., 2016), and a number of predictors of fear extinction phenotype
have been identified (Galatzer-Levy et al., 2013; Monfils et al., 2019; Shumake et al., 2014, 2018). However, the
ability to predict individual differences in reward extinction remains a knowledge gap. Extinction of fear and
reward memories are subject to the same return of behavior phenomena and have overlap in neural circuitry
that includes the medial prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus (Goode & Maren, 2019; Peters et al.,
2009). In addition, orexin neurons, which originate in the lateral hypothalamus (LH), have been implicated in the
extinction of conditioned responses to fear, food, and alcohol cues. Activation of orexin receptors in the lateral
hypothalamus (LH) is positively correlated with the return of conditioned responses to reward and fear cues after
extinction (Hamlin et al., 2007; Monfils et al., 2019; Moorman et al., 2016; Sharko et al., 2017) and antagonism
of orexin receptors prevents the return of these behaviors (Cason & Aston-Jones, 2013; Flores et al., 2014;
Lawrence et al., 2006). Orexin neurons in the LH are also activated by carbon dioxide (CO2) challenge (Johnson
et al., 2012; Monfils et al., 2019). It was recently found that behavioral CO2 reactivity has a negative correlation
with both fear memory after extinction and orexin activation in the LH and that there is a positive correlation
between fear memory after extinction and orexin activation in the LH (Monfils et al., 2019). The central hypothesis
of the proposed work is that behavioral reactivity and orexin activation to a CO2 challenge can be used to predict
extinction phenotype to both reward and fear cues. This will be tested by determining whether CO2 reactivity
predicts long-term extinction memory in food- and alcohol-conditioned rats and whether CO2 reactivity and orexin
activation in the LH can identify common predictors of long-term extinction memory to food, alcohol, and fear
cues. CO2 reactivity data and brain tissue will be collected from two sets rats that have undergone food or alcohol
conditioning, extinction, and a long-term memory test. This will be combined with previously collected data on
CO2 reactivity and orexin activation in fear conditioned rats. Statistical modeling will be used to determine which
subcomponents of behavioral CO2 reactivity and orexin activation are the best predictors of extinction memory."

Amino acids are an intrinsic part of protein biosynthesis, nucleotide production, and provide sources of carbon
and nitrogen for the cell. The cell keeps amino acid (AA) levels balanced by increasing AA transporters on the
cell surface, catabolizing AAs to form essential metabolites, protein translation, and storage of surplus AAs in
the lysosome. An autophagic response is initiated when the cell is starved of AAs. Exposure to high
concentrations of AAs is also problematic, but the mechanisms underlying that toxicity are not yet fully
understood. AA levels are tightly regulated and when this regulation is disrupted, toxic intermediates can buildup
and diseases such as phenylketonuria and cancer can occur. Previous research in our lab has studied amino
acid toxicity through vacuole impairment, which is imprecise and cannot always provide a detailed understanding
of the effects of single amino acids. To circumvent these issues, I have designed a yeast strain that
overexpresses a mutated copy of Gap1, a high-capacity, low-specificity amino acid permease. Because of the
two mutated Gap1 residues, this permease remains on the plasma membrane instead of being recycled to the
vacuole in high AA conditions. This causes the tight AA regulation to be broken and initiate continuous AA uptake,
which will allow us to study the effects of specific AAs on cellular processes. The aim of this project is to elucidate
the role each AA plays in toxicity and cellular function using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system. Aim
1 will identify transcriptional, metabolic, and organellar changes resulting from AA toxicity. Aim 2 aims to
understand the cell’s capacity to buffer excess amino acids and adapt to their toxicity. Finally, the Aim 3 will
characterize the mammalian plasma membrane transporter, L-type amino acid transporter (LAT1). LAT1 and its
regulation are poorly characterized, and this aim will begin to fill this knowledge gap. Together, these proposed
aims will help to uncover how AAs affect cellular function using the power of yeast genetics and it will begin to
elucidate amino acid transporter regulation in mammalian cells."

Mitochondrial dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress are hallmarks of pathologic aging and are
intricately linked in the onset and pathogenesis of etiologically-diverse neurodegenerative disorders including
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRDs). This has led to significant interest in understanding
how cells regulate mitochondria in response to ER stress. Intriguingly, the ER stress-responsive kinase PERK
is localized to ER-mitochondria contact sites where it acts as an effector of both the unfolded protein response
(UPR) and the integrated stress response (ISR). Additionally, PERK-dependent transcriptional and translational
signaling modulates nearly all aspects of mitochondrial biology including remodeling of mitochondrial cristae and
respiratory complexes to enhance energy capacity, regulation of mitochondrial proteostasis (i.e., protein import,
chaperone activity, and proteolysis), and remodeling of membrane phospholipid composition to induce protective
mitochondrial elongation. Through these mechanisms PERK protects mitochondria during ER stress; however,
persistent PERK activation induced by severe or chronic ER stress leads to apoptosis. Thus, PERK signaling
both promotes adaptive mitochondrial remodeling and dictates cell fate in response to varying levels of cellular
stress. The importance of PERK in regulating adaptation and survival is further supported by clinical, genetic,
and pharmacologic evidence demonstrating that imbalanced PERK signaling contributes to the pathogenesis of
etiologically-diverse neurodegenerative diseases. Hypomorphic variants in the gene that encodes PERK
(EIF2AK3) predispose individuals to tauopathies such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and late-stage
AD. In addition, exogenous PERK activation mitigates tau pathology in PSP, further indicating that protective
PERK signaling is insufficient in the pathogenesis of this disease. Collectively, these observations establish
PERK as a critical regulator of mitochondrial adaptation to cellular insult and suggest that imbalances in PERK
signaling contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction implicated in neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis. Using
cell culture models derived from patients expressing a hypomorphic PERK variant, I will show that deficiencies
in PERK signaling impair mitochondria and contribute to neurodegenerative phenotypes such as tau pathology
(Aim 1). Further, I will demonstrate that pharmacologic activation of the ISR—a stress-responsive program
comprised of the eIF2α kinases GCN2, HRI, PKR, and PERK—mitigates mitochondrial dysfunction and improves
neuronal survival in a human neuronal model of PERK-deficient neurodegeneration (Aim 2). These efforts are
significant as they will define a critical role for PERK in regulating mitochondrial adaptation during
neurodegeneration and establish pharmacologic ISR activation as a potential therapeutic strategy against
neurodegenerative disease—for which no disease-modifying treatments are currently available."

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal disease of widespread motor neuron degeneration in the brain and
spinal cord. Progressive impairment of the blood-CNS--barrier (B-CNS-B) represents an additional disease
mechanism. Capillary endothelial cell (EC) damage in the CNS has been shown in ALS rodent models and in
ALS patients. We demonstrated benefits of intravenously (iv) transplanted human bone marrow-derived
endothelial progenitor cells (hBM-EPCs) on functional disease outcomes and motor neurons in an SOD1 mouse
model of ALS by attenuating damage to the compromised barrier. Transplanted hBM-EPCs may also exert
positive effects by release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) and facilitate restoration of degenerated ECs through
delivery of cargo proteins. Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) was determined as the most abundant high-expression
protein in EVs and may represent a therapeutically active component for EC-targeted regeneration. We showed
that ApoA1 enhanced EC survival in an ALS-like pathologic condition in vitro. The purpose of this project is to
determine whether ApoA1 facilitates endothelium homeostasis leading to B-CNS-B repair in ALS. The
significant scientific advance of this project is the demonstration that ApoA1 administration elucidates
reparative processes in B-CNS-B restoration and promotes motor neuron survival in G93A SOD1 mutant mice.
Also, the determination of reparative mechanisms underlying B-CNS-B restoration by assessing ApoA1 effects
is the novelty of this project. An important aspect of the proposed study is B-CNS-B restoration in a symptomatic
mouse model of ALS with existing barrier damage. Aim 1 will establish therapeutic efficacy of a single iv
administration of ApoA1 into symptomatic ALS mice of both genders on B-CNS-B repair by examining behavioral
disease outcomes (Aim 1A), functional (Aim 1B) barrier repair, glial cells status (Aim 1C), and motor neuron
survival (Aim 1D). Aim 2 will determine the mechanism(s) of ApoA1-mediated vascular repair in symptomatic
ALS mice by examining the pathway of this protein on endothelium integrity. This aim will address activity of the
ApoA1 protein by impeding the downstream signaling through the cytosolic PI3K/Akt pathway. The effects of
inhibiting intracellular signaling will be examined with the same outcomes as described in Aim 1 Sub-aims. Our
experimental design to determine the efficacy of ApoA1 administration is a highly translational and innovative
mechanism-based approach for repairing the damaged B-CNS-B. Positive project outcomes will evidence the
mechanistic role of ApoA1 protein in restoring EC function towards repair of the altered B-CNS-B in ALS. Even
if Aim 1 results are negative, probing ApoAI in Aim 2 via inhibitory paradigm will reveal novel ApoAI-based
approaches to optimize protein treatment. This study represents a relatively low-risk, but high-reward and
innovative protein-mediated therapy for vascular repair in ALS, thereby facilitating translation into a clinical
application for ALS patients."

 Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a group of genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous connective tissue
disorders that results in low bone mass, bone deformity, and bone fractures. OI has an estimated prevalence
of 1 in 15,000 births. Disruptions in multiple processes such as collagen synthesis, collagen posttranslational
modification, signaling defects and intracellular trafficking lead to OI. The primary focus of medical therapy has
been to increase bone mass and reduce fracture risk through medical and surgical treatment. The mainstay of
treatment in this population is bisphosphonates, which reduces bone loss by suppressing bone turnover.
However, these drugs can only delay bone loss without fully preventing it. We've shown that modulation of the
Wnt/Frizzled2 signaling pathway can in increase bone mass in wild type mice. My objective in this project is to
test whether the Wnt/Frizzled2 signaling pathway can be used to treat both skeletal features of a dominant and
recessive form OI, reduce cerebellar dysfunction in the Wnt1sw/sw mouse model and investigate how modulation
in the Wnt/Frizzled2 signaling pathway increases bone mass. Our preliminary studies indicate this modulate
increases bone mass in a dominant (Col1a2tm1.1Mcbr) and recessive model of OI (Crtap-/-). In other preliminary
studies, I found that modulating the Wnt/Frizzled2 pathway increases downstream activation of the mTORC1
signaling pathway. The central hypothesis is that modulation of the Wnt/Frizzled2 signaling pathway
increases bone mass through activation of downstream targets of the mTORC1 signaling pathway. We plan to
test our hypothesis in the following ways: characterize the skeletal in two OI mouse models after treatment with
a modulated Wnt/Frizzled2 signaling molecule, assess the changes in the extraskeletal phenotype in the
Wnt1sw/sw mouse model and investigate the role of Wnt/Frizzled2 signaling in mTORC1 pathway in vivo and in
vitro on bone mass and cellular proliferation and function, respectively. By assessing these aims, we will
elucidate the role of Wnt/Frizzled2 signaling in bone formation and gain insight on how downstream activation
of the mTORC1 signaling pathway alters bone formation."
10792624,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Diabetes prevalence continues to rise globally, with more than 37 million individuals (11% of the population)
currently affected in the United States. Approximately 15-20% of these people will experience a diabetic foot
ulcer (DFU) at some point in their lives, with significant impact on quality of life, morbidity, and mortality. DFU
are a harbinger of lower extremity amputation which occurs in approximately 150,000 Americans annually.
Despite advances in wound care and related technologies, delayed healing and high recurrence rates of DFU
remain major clinical challenges in current practice and create an enormous burden on patients and the
healthcare system. In 2018 the NIDDK established the Diabetic Foot Consortium to address this large unmet
need by execution of high quality, multi-center studies in DFU subjects with a focus on biomarker development
and validation. The UCSF Diabetic Foot Clinical Research Unit (CRU) is one of the six initial participating
centers in the DFC. Among its accomplishments, the DFC has executed two ongoing biomarker validation
trials, initiated a biorepository protocol, reviewed multiple ancillary study proposals, and is currently finalizing a
master protocol to enroll any patient with an incipient DFU. In its next renewal period, these DFC efforts will be
expanded to include new candidate biomarkers, examine standard of care practices through a new master
protocol, incorporate social determinants of health (SDOH), execute ancillary studies, and augment the
recruitment of a diverse population by engagement of satellite sites.
The UCSF Diabetic Foot CRU consists of two major affiliated medical centers- UCSF Medical Center and
Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital- linked to satellite podiatry clinics in the Bay Area that share a
research umbrella organization (Center for Clinical Research; CCR). Over the last year we have been able to
expand subject recruitment for DFC trials dramatically by the incorporation of CCR clinics. We have also
initiated pilot feasibility studies to incorporate SDOH collection within the currently ongoing biomarker trials (c-
Myc and TEWL). During the next 5 year funding period, our multi-disciplinary research team will further
contribute to the DFC by activation of a new common Master Protocol inclusive of all patients with an open
DFU, incorporate the collection of SDOH data and examine its associations with outcomes, and expand the
infrastructure through the addition of CCR clinical performance sites."
10904015,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A fundamental challenge for the scientific community in the 21st century is learning how to turn this deluge of
data into evidence that can inform decision-making about improving health and preventing illness at the
individual and population levels. The maturing field of real-time infectious disease forecasting is a prime
example of a research area with great potential for leveraging modern analytical methods to maximize the
impact on public health. Infectious diseases exact an enormous toll on global health each year. Improved real-
time forecasts of infectious disease outbreaks can inform targeted intervention and prevention strategies, such
as planning for surge capacity, increasing healthcare staffing, and designing vaccine studies. However we
currently have a limited understanding of the best ways to integrate these types of forecasts into real-time
public health decision-making. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop stand-alone and
ensemble infectious disease models and methodologies that support forecasting and inference about
outbreaks and (2) to expand our collaborative, online platform for collection, dissemination, evaluation, and
synthesis of forecasts from different research teams. Additionally, we will continue to develop a suite of open-
source educational modules to train researchers and public health officials in developing, validating, and
implementing time-series forecasting, with a focus on real-time infectious disease applications."
10912567,"This mentored research program aims to develop Dr. Perugino into an independent investigator studying the
immunologic mechanisms of fibrosis. The research goals entail the identification of specific self-proteins driving
adaptive immune responses in the context of IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD), a recently described immune-
mediated fibrotic disease. Candidate: Dr. Perugino is a junior faculty member in the Rheumatology Unit at
Massachusetts General Hospital and has been conducting bench-based research since 2015. His short-term
career goals are to build a stronger foundation in molecular biology, advance his skills in statistical analysis,
develop proficiency in single-cell sequencing, gain expertise in creating and screening peptide-MHC yeast
display libraries, and build his professional skills towards independent investigation. These goals will be
supported by a series of coursework through Harvard University and the Harvard Clinical and Translational
Science Center. He has recently published four first-author papers, the first identifying galectin-3 as a novel B
cell self-antigen in IgG4-RD (Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, 2019), the 2nd linking the diversity of
auto-antibody responses with disease severity in IgG4-RD (Arthritis & Rheumatology, 2019), a 3rd establishing
CD4+ T cells with cytotoxic features as likely disease drivers in systemic sclerosis (Journal of Clinical
Investigation, 2020) and a 4th establishing the effector phenotype of cytotoxic CD4+ T cells in IgG4-RD (Journal
of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, 2020). This work forms the foundation for this K08 proposal. Mentorship,
Training Activities, and Environment: Dr. Perugino has been under the direct mentorship of Dr. Shiv Pillai since
2015 and Dr. John Stone since 2014 acting as mentors in investigation and translational research, respectively.
The training plan builds upon the skills learned under this mentorship team. Guided by his advisors and
collaborators, Dr. Perugino will gain proficiency in (1) single cell RNA sequencing (Dr. Alex Shalek), (2) Ig/TCR
repertoire analyses (Dr. Mark Davis), (3) peptide-MHC yeast display library development (Dr. Michael Birnbaum),
immune cell interactions (Dr. Michael Brenner) and biostatistical analysis (Dr. Musie Ghebremichael). Research
Program: The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that the immune response in IgG4-RD is driven by the
crosstalk between B and T cells directed at specific epitopes derived from the same protein antigen. Leveraging
the identification of clonal expansions of B and T cells in IgG4-RD, the proposal entails the determination of
dominant B and T cell clones, which will subsequently be used to single cell clone soluble antigen receptors and
use those as probes to pull down their cognate antigens. These complementary approaches, one focused on B
cells (Aim 1) and the other on T cells (Aim 2), entail the validation of B and T cell responses among the largest
single-center cohort of IgG4-RD bio-samples in the United States. These studies will serve as a foundation for
Dr. Perugino's future goals of identifying the HLA and antigenic determinants that distinguish the clinical
phenotypes of different immune-mediated fibrotic diseases, such as IgG4-RD, as an independent investigator."

10908365,"Project Summary/Abstract
Alcohol consumption at hazardous levels is associated with negative consequences at nearly every step of the
HIV care continuum. It is a critical factor in HIV treatment that significantly contributes to poor treatment-related
outcomes. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of alcohol interventions for people with HIV (PWH) have had
limited success, perhaps due to an increasingly recognized syndemic of co-occurring hazardous alcohol use
and other mental health-related problems among PWH. Up to 63% of PWH meet criteria for both a substance
use disorder and another psychiatric disorder—necessitating a shift in the literature towards transdiagnostic
approaches that target core psychological processes that underlie multiple mental health and substance-
related problems. One transdiagnostic mechanism that is particularly relevant to alcohol and other substance
use is experiential avoidance (EA)— i.e., repeated, and maladaptive, use of substances and/or other behaviors
to escape or avoid unwanted thoughts, feelings, and/or urges. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is a
promising transdiagnostic intervention for PWH that targets EA. ACT is an empirically supported treatment for
multiple psychological and behavioral health-related outcomes; however there have not been any full-scale
RCTs of ACT for alcohol use among any population, including PWH. We recently adapted a telephone-
delivered ACT intervention originally developed for smoking cessation, into an intervention for PWH who drink
at hazardous levels (NIH/NIAAA; R34AA026246). With a multidisciplinary team, and with two rounds of input
from PWH, we developed a six-session, telephone-delivered ACT intervention for alcohol use and
subsequently conducted a pilot feasibility/acceptability RCT. We found high acceptability of the adapted ACT
intervention, and evidence of feasibility for conducting a full-scale, remote, RCT. The overall objective of this
application is therefore to determine the relative efficacy of ACT, compared to a standard Brief Alcohol
Intervention (BI), for reducing alcohol use and comorbid symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress among
adult PWH who are hazardous drinkers. The specific aims are: To determine the relative efficacy of ACT,
compared to BI, for reducing alcohol use among PWH (Aim 1) and to determine if ACT has an effect on
transdiagnostic processes that in turn affect alcohol use and other psychological and functional outcomes (Aim
2). We will accomplish these aims by: conducting a fully remote, relative efficacy RCT in which we randomly
assign 300 PWH who are hazardous drinkers to either the ACT intervention we developed (n = 150), or a BI
intervention (n = 150) previously shown to reduce alcohol use among PWH. We will assess alcohol-related
outcomes—via self-report and a biomarker (phosphatidylethanol) – at baseline, post-treatment, and again 3-,
6-, and 12-months post-randomization. We will also measure EA to determine if it mediates treatment effects
for alcohol use and other psychological (i.e., symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress) and functional
outcomes, measured at all timepoints."
10913497,"The long-term goal of this project is to simultaneously decrease treatment-related morbidity from unnecessary
over-treatment of men with localized prostate cancer (PCa) while curing more men by minimizing under-
treatment of men with higher risk PCa. In this proposal we aim to determine if tissue based gene expression
classifiers (GEC) can be utilized to improve both cancer control and quality of life (QOL) in men with localized
PCa. This goal will be carried out through three specific aims. In Aim 1 we will develop a universal risk score
that combines genetic, clinical, and pathologic variables in a manner that is agnostic to which of the three
commercially available GEC tests used. This will be done through assembling a large cohort of men with
targeted MRI/ultrasound fusion biopsies of the same prostate tumor focus and analyzing individual tumors with
each of the three tests. We will then develop a conversion method aligning each GEC score with a new
universal score, and we will apply this to a cohort of 1000 men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer followed
in our statewide prospective registry. This data will be utilized to validate our recently developed clinical-
genomic risk grouping system, broadening it to incorporate all GEC tests, and focusing it on appropriate
stratification of favorable risk prostate cancer potentially suitable for active surveillance. We hypothesize that
the universal integrated clinical-genomic risk groups will provide improved discrimination compared to standard
clinical categories and will expand the pool of active surveillance-eligible patients. In Aim 2 we will conduct the
first ever prospective randomized trial of the clinical utility and clinical impact of GEC testing in favorable risk
localized prostate cancer, leveraging two statewide collaboratives containing over 60 urology and radiation
oncology practices. Patients will be randomized to standard clinical risk stratification +/- GEC testing in order to
determine the impact of testing on treatment decisions (active surveillance versus radical treatment), cancer
control, and QOL. We hypothesize that GEC testing will decrease the use of primary therapy and increase
QOL at 3 years, while maintaining rates of grade reclassification and biochemical recurrence at the same time
point. Aim 3 seeks to determine the clinical impact of GEC testing on treatment failure and patient-reported
QOL in men at high risk of recurrence post-prostatectomy. This aim leverages the recently accrued G-MINOR
trial that randomized approximately 350 men at high risk of failure after prostatectomy to clinical risk
stratification +/- GEC testing to assess decision making based on GEC testing. By extending the follow-up of
this trial, we will determine how GEC testing impacts long-term tumor control and QOL. We hypothesize that
GEC use in higher risk patients will provide more accurate risk stratification and targeted treatment decisions,
leading to improved cancer control and QOL. This work has the potential to personalize treatment decision-
making for PCa patients based on their tumor’s biology, allowing some men to avoid costly and toxic over-
treatment while also decreasing the burden of recurrent disease from inappropriate under-treatment."
10912636,"The role of fibroblasts in end organ fibrosis is well established, but insights into their roles in chronic
inflammatory diseases in peripheral tissues like rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is still emerging. We identified a
highly expanded inflammatory subpopulation of fibroblasts in the sublining region of RA synovial tissue. It
accounts for >50% of all fibroblasts in the synovium in RA, but it is a rare population in osteoarthritis (OA). The
expanded population is distinguished by high expression of CD90 (Thy1, a sublining marker) and HLA-DR, and
the production of IL-6 and many chemokines. We hypothesize that these CD90+DR+IL-6+ fibroblasts are key in
driving inflammation directly by secreting inflammatory factors and indirectly by recruiting and activating
leukocytes to maintain chronic inflammation. When analyzing single cell RNA-seq data from the RA/SLE
Accelerating Medicines Partnership (AMP) Consortium, we found that markers of lining and sublining
fibroblasts in synovium were not absolute – but instead represented a gradient in gene expression in trajectory
analysis. We found that this transcriptional gradient corresponds to an anatomic spatial gradient in the
synovium emanating from blood vessels. Our data suggest that Notch signaling is a dominant driver of the
gradient starting with fibroblasts around blood vessels and extending to sublining fibroblasts that express
Notch3 receptors and Jagged (Jag)1 Notch ligands.
 Here, we wish to determine if Notch 3 signaling specifically on fibroblasts drives the spatial pattering
and the differentiation of sublining fibroblasts. To accomplish this, in Aim 1 we use mixed cell organoids with
endothelial tubules and fibroblasts to compare spatial pattering and differentiation of Notch3 deficient
compared to control fibroblasts. In Aim 2, we determine the location of the CD90+DR+ inflammatory cytokine
producing fibroblasts and Notch3+ fibroblasts in the synovium and determine which fibroblast population(s)
most significantly associate with leukocytes (T cells, B cells and macrophages). In Aim 3 we activate synovial
fibroblast lines with inflammatory cytokines that are found in RA, in the presence or absence of Notch ligands.
We use flow cytometry, RNA-seq, LDA, and trajectory analyses to compare fibroblast cell states induced in
vitro with those found in the synovium in RA. Then, we extend the Notch gradient concept from fibroblast
differentiation to how fibroblast-derived Notch ligands activate attached T cell in organoids. Finally, in Aim 4,
we determine if targeted, conditional disruption of Notch signaling in fibroblasts or targeted conditional deletion
of Notch ligands in fibroblasts prevents inflammatory arthritis in mouse models. Together, these studies will
advance our knowledge of how fibroblasts differentiate in RA to become drivers of inflammation and pathology
in chronically inflamed synovial tissues, and how they might be targeted therapeutically in murine models."
10692309,"Chronic pain is a major health concern for returning Veterans and is associated with decreases in quality of
life. The management of pain, including non-drug approaches, is a high priority for the Veterans Administration
(VA) and VA primary care providers. The long-term goal is to determine the efficacy and mechanism of
clinically useful interventions for chronic pain. Sensory interventions such as widespread pressure may be one
effective approach. In addition to published studies documenting significant effects on anxiety and sleep, our
preliminary data suggest that a Weighted Blanket (WB) is a feasible, low-cost complementary intervention for
chronic pain. In direct response to the CSR&D priority research area “Pain mechanisms and treatments
including alternatives to opioids,” the overall objectives in this application are to determine whether in Veterans
with chronic pain and sleep disturbance, a heavy WB versus light control blanket will reduce (i)
musculoskeletal chronic pain and (ii) sleep disturbance, and (iii) whether improvements in sleep mediate
reductions in pain. Our central hypothesis is that although both study arms will be associated with positive
clinical outcomes, deeper pressure will be associated with greater reductions in pain impact and sleep
disturbance, with changes in sleep mediating changes in pain. The rationale for this project is that determining
the impact of WBs on chronic pain and sleep disturbance is expected to offer novel insights into the efficacy
and mechanism of WBs, informing both mechanistic studies and clinical treatment. Guided by published and
strong preliminary data, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Compare the
efficacy of a WB and control blanket on chronic pain in Veterans with musculoskeletal chronic pain and sleep
disturbance; 2) Compare the efficacy of a WB and control blanket on sleep disturbance in Veterans with
musculoskeletal chronic pain and sleep disturbance; and 3) Examine the mediation effects of sleep on chronic
pain. This will be accomplished by recruiting Veterans with musculoskeletal chronic pain and sleep disturbance
and randomizing 160 Veterans to receive either a heavy (15-lb) or light (3-lb; control) blanket. We will collect
measures of pain impact (primary), pain catastrophizing, and pain medication use, as well as sleep disturbance
(primary) and sleep efficiency and total sleep time over 6 weeks of overnight use of either blanket. Ecological
momentary assessment (EMA) methods will be deployed via smartphone to capture study adherence. The
research proposed here is innovative, because it: 1) leverages recent research on the affective and sensory
effects of deep pressure; 2) tests novel effects of an established intervention for sleep and anxiety; and 3)
utilizes a remote intervention implemented passively during sleep, reducing participant time and effort. The
research proposed in this project is significant since it will identify effects of a low-cost, accessible intervention
that has a high potential to improve chronic pain and sleep disturbance in this difficult to treat population.
These innovations are expected to open new horizons in both research and treatment of chronic pain."
10917415,"Abstract
Telomeres are nucleoproteins with TTAGGG DNA repeats at the ends of chromosomes that protect coding DNA from
erosion and detection as DNA damage. Telomere maintenance is necessary for cancer cells to have unlimited proliferation
capacity. Most cancers maintain their telomeres via activation of the ribonucleoprotein telomerase containing a catalytic
subunit encoded by the TERT gene and an RNA template encoded by the TERC gene. Cancers with low or no telomerase
activity often use another mechanism to extend their telomeres, the Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) in which
telomeres are maintained via homologous telomeric-DNA recombination, but the mechanism is still poorly understood.
ALT tumors contain extra-chromosomal telomeric DNA C-circles, which (detected with a unique PCR assay) provides a
specific and sensitive ALT biomarker. We have shown that quantifying TERT mRNA expression together with telomeric
DNA C-circles enables classifying cancers into 3 groups based on telomere maintenance mechanism (TMM); telomerase-
positive (high TERT), ALT-positive (C-circle+), and TMM-negative. Classifying the childhood cancer neuroblastoma by
TMM provides prognostic information that overrides currently employed clinical and biological prognostic markers, and
our preliminary data suggest this is possible for other cancer types. ALT cancers are consistently difficult to treat but have
dysfunctional telomeres, creating unique vulnerabilities that can provide novel therapeutic targets. For example, we have
recently demonstrated high ATM kinase activation at telomeres in ALT neuroblastoma leads to resistance to DNA damaging
chemotherapy that can be reversed with a clinical-stage ATM inhibitor AZD0156. Biomarkers of TMM provide both
prognostic information and the C-circle assay can potentially serve as a companion diagnostic assay to identify patients with
tumors that are likely to be more responsive to novel ALT-targeted therapies. Thus, it is important to define parameters
that impact accurate TMM assessment of cancers, i.e. accurate quantitation of TERT mRNA and DNA C-circles. We will
define the impact of collection and storage conditions and the minimum amounts of tissue and amounts, and quality of
nucleic acids needed for the assays. Identifying ALT patients from a blood sample would have clinical utility, and our
preliminary data suggest that C-circles can be detected in plasma containing circulating tumor DNA. Thus, we also propose
to develop and validate a plasma C-circle assay as a novel approach to identifying patients with ALT cancers. Finally, to
ensure that these assays can be used for clinical risk stratification, and as companion diagnostics for selection of therapy,
we propose to carry out studies necessary for CAP/CLIA certification of TERT mRNA qPCR and the telomeric DNA C-
circle assay. To accomplish our aims, we are integrating sample collection from adult and pediatric cancers together with
a team of experts in telomere biology and molecular pathology. This project will provide important information on analyzing
cancer TMM phenotype that will be of value to both research and clinical labs and will enable completion of regulatory
requirements necessary for clinical implementation of the assays."
10907995,"Sulfated glycan 8-mer is a carbohydrate-based compound with anticoagulant activity. The goal
of this project is to replace animal-sourced low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) with the 8-
mer. LMWHs are partially depolymerized natural products of heparin, which are isolated from
porcine intestine. A worldwide distribution of contaminated heparin in 2007 was associated with
85 deaths in the US, which is impacted the supply of LMWH. LMWHs are complex mixtures,
having average molecular masses of 3500-6000 Daltons, corresponding to 12-20 saccharide
units. The production of homogeneous LMWHs has not been possible due to difficulties in the
synthesis. Glycan Therapeutics proposes to use an innovative chemoenzymatic approach to
prepare synthetic heparin to substitute animal-sourced LMWH. The 8-mer product possesses
following properties compared with other candidates: relative short synthesis, fast clearance
property and low risk for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Two specific aims are proposed.
Aim 1 is to scale up the synthesis of 8-mer by 10-fold in the phase I funding period and 100-fold
in the phase II funding period. Aim 2 is to conduct the pharmacodynamic analysis of 8-mer and
enoxaparin in advanced animal models using the quantitative LC-MS/MS method. In phase I
funding period, the focus is on method development for analyzing 8-mer and enoxaparin in a
mouse model. In the phase II funding period, we will analyze the pharmacodynamics of 8-mer
and enoxaparin in a nonhuman primate model. The completion of this project will modernize this
century-old drug with improved safety and anticoagulant properties."

Network gene analysis suggests that high confidence autism spectrum disorder (hcASD) genes operate through
convergent mechanisms that predominantly support synaptic function, which, in turn, can determine anatomical
and functional brain connectivity. Several variants in ANK2 have been identified in ASD patients and this gene
has been consistently considered a top hcASD risk. ANK2 encodes ankyrin-B (AnkB), which roles in axonal
biology may be an underlying factor in ASD pathophysiology. However, our recent findings indicate that ankyrin-
B also plays important roles at the cortical excitatory postsynapse. Moreover, both predominant AnkB isoforms
in neurons (220 kDa and 440 kDa AnkB) are abundantly expressed in dendrites, where they likely perform
isoform-specific roles and interact with unique partners, including proteins encoded by other hsASD genes. Thus,
it is important to define the isoform-specific roles and partners of AnkB at the postsynapse. To accomplish these
goal we will 1) use in vivo proximity-dependent biotin identification (iBioID) combined with in tandem mass
spectrometry (MS) to capture and identify AnkB interacting partners in the postsynapse by leveraging our novel
biotin ligase BirA-tagged conditional AnkB (AnkB-BioID) knock-in mouse and isoform-specific AnkB knockout
mice; 2) combine live and super-resolution microscopies and cellular assays to validate compelling AnkB
interactors; and 3) define the significance of novel AnkB PSD complexes for synaptic development and function."
10911049,"Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a lethal and devastating complication of hematopoietic cell
transplantation (HCT) or bone marrow transplantation (BMT), where HCT/BMT constitutes a predominant and
curative approach for the treatment of hematological malignancies and other disorders. Because of exposure
to environmental agents, such as the carcinogen agent orange, members of the US Military are under risk to
develop hematological malignancies during their years as active soldiers or later as veterans. GVHD is caused
by donor (graft) T cell-mediated immune attack of recipient (host) tissues and also complicates the clinical
picture after combined transplantation of bone marrow and a solid organ. Veterans are also under higher risk
to develop end-stage solid organ failure that requires transplantation. Novel treatment strategies are needed in
BMT/HCT patients to maintain the donor T lymphocyte-mediated anti-tumor immune (graft-versus-tumor (GVT)
response and suppress the GVHD. In this context, therapeutic achievement of mixed chimerism, which is
characterized by the presence of donor and recipient hematopoietic cell after transplantation, results in
immune tolerance by donor T cells against the recipient and in regulation of GVHD. Mixed chimerism also
tolerizes recipient’s immune cells against the donor, suppressing the rejection of solid organ graft after
combined transplantation and reduces the use of toxic immune suppressive medications. Current clinical
protocols mostly use nonmyeloablative preparation (lower dose of chemotherapy and/or radiation without
completely eradicating recipient’s bone marrow cells) before the BMT/HCT to achieve mixed chimerism. This
approach carries a high risk of tumor relapse. By contrast, we use myeloablative preparation (higher dose of
chemotherapy and/or radiation with complete eradication of recipient’s bone marrow cells) in our BMT model
with mixed chimerism, where the GVT response is preserved and the risk of cancer relapse is reduced. We
induce mixed chimerism-dependent regulation of GVHD by modulation of intestinal immune pathways using a
completely novel approach and with self-limited helminth colonization of the gut. We have shown before that
helminths promote the generation of mixed chimerism by stimulating recipient cell Th2 signaling and Th2-
dependent generation of TGFβ. In this application, in Aim #1 we propose to investigate the elements of
Th2/TGFβ pathways critical to generation of mixed chimerism. In Aim #2, we will explore the role of different
immune regulatory circuitries relevant to mixed chimerism-dependent regulation of GVHD and solid organ
rejection. In Aim #3, we will investigate the effect of mixed chimerism-induced immune regulation on the GVT
response using a mouse leukemia/lymphoma model syngeneic with the BMT recipient strain. Our long-term
goals are to dissect immune regulatory pathways important in helminth-induced mixed chimerism and apply
the knowledge to clinical transplantation. Live helminths have been safely administered to immune suppressed
patients, and helminth products with immune regulatory properties have been discovered for potential use in
clinical practice. Therefore, targeting helminth-modulated signaling pathways with small molecules, helminths
or their products may be a safe, potent and novel approach to promote transplantation tolerance without using
toxic immune suppressive medications and preserve the beneficial GVT effect."

 It is increasingly clear that bacteria play an important role in human health. While it is natural to focus on how
intestinal bacteria affect disease, intriguing ﬁndings have elucidated the extent to which bacteria inhabit solid
tumors. Microbes have been detected in lung, pancreatic, breast, oral, gallbladder, ovarian, liver, and colorectal
cancers. Localization has been ascribed to several mechanisms, including preference for anaerobic or facultative
anaerobic bacteria to grow in the hypoxic core of tumors, presence of bacterial nutrients, lack of immune surveil-
lance, and leakiness of the often poorly structured vasculature surrounding neoplastic tissue. This tendency for
localization to solid tumors suggests that bacteria could be engineered for precise and robust drug production and
delivery from within the solid tumor environment. This dovetails with 20 years of progress in synthetic biology,
which has tended to focus on microbial engineering. However, information on how the tumor microenvironment
affects bacterial growth is largely unknown. The microenvironment will affect bacterial gene expression that ul-
timately underlies the functionality of engineered therapies, and it is difﬁcult to imagine a predictive framework
for engineered bacterial therapies without a quantitative understanding of how bacteria react to the environment
of a growing tumor. We will use a probiotic strain of E. coli with an established safety record to develop a novel
class of biosensors to noninvasively investigate bacterial growth in the tumor microenvironment. Initially, we
will develop lysis-based biosensors that respond to speciﬁc tumor environment targets: hypoxia, pH, glucose,
and lactate (Aim 1). We will also engineer an inducible quorum sensing (QS) system that enables external control
of bacterial population dynamics, including the ability to eliminate a speciﬁc strain whenever desired (Aim 1).
Together these strains will allow us to modulate and monitor population dynamics in vivo, enabling both sens-
ing of the local environment and maintenance of an external control switch. We will test these strains using an
established in vitro organoid model (Aim 2) and in two clinically relevant animal models for solid tumor growth.
Additionally, we will use our previously developed dynOMICS technology to screen tumor extract from the two
animal models and construct a second suite of biosensors for monitoring the tumor environment (Aim 2). These
biosensors will then be tested in the animal models. We will visualize bacterial populations in a colorectal tumor
model with bacteria that are engineered to produce luciferase in order to monitor colony dynamics using our es-
tablished methods (Aim 3). We will also build on recently reported technology whereby bacteria are modiﬁed for
use with ultrasound through addition of gas vesicles that permit high resolution imaging of the engineered bac-
teria. We will use the ultrasound method to investigate NASH-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) where
a high-fat diet is used to induce HCC at 20 weeks in mice (Aim 4). This project will quantitatively characterize
how bacterial strains sense, respond, and grow in the tumors. The results will establish a platform for future
exploration of therapies that are produced and delivered by bacteria that grow within solid tumors."
10881771,"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a serious health concern for military personnel, particularly males beyond
40 years of age, including military veterans. According to The Defense Medical Epidemiology Database for 1995-2004
the incidence of RCC specifically for military members after the 4th decade of life is dramatically increased to 8.5 as
compared to 1.5 cases per 100,000 person-years of the overall incidence. This proposal investigates direct
mechanistic connection between selective autophagy and glucose metabolism in the context of renal cancer
cells. Autophagy is a tightly regulated process of self-digestion. Formation of an autophagosome requires
lipidation and insertion of microtubule associated protein 1 light chains A, B and C (MAP1LC3A, B, C, referred
to as LC3A, LC3B, and LC3C) into the autophagosomal membrane. We established that LC3C autophagy is
tumor suppressing and functions downstream form VHL, tumor suppressor lost in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.
LC3C is an evolutionary late gene, present only in higher primates and humans, that contains a unique and
conserved C-terminal 20 amino acid peptide that is cleaved during initiation of LC3C autophagy. The C-terminal
peptide of LC3C has a proline hydroxylation motif similar to the canonical motifs in HIFαs, where prolines are
hydroxylated by 2-oxyglutarate (2OG)-dependent EGLN proline hydroxylases. Our preliminary data indicate that
P133 within the LC3C peptide undergoes hydroxylation by EGLN3 proline hydroxylase in an autophagy-
dependent manner. Recently we discovered that LC3C autophagy requires glucose metabolic flux. In turn, loss
of LC3C increases the steady-state levels of glycolytic and pentose phosphate metabolites, representing
hallmarks of oncogenic form of metabolism (Warburg effect) particularly relevant in ccRCC. We determined that
LC3C co-immunoprecipitates and targets for autolysosomal degradation malate/2-oxyglutarate(2OG) and
aspartate /glutamate antiporters, SCL25A11 and SLC25A13, respectively that are part of the mitochondrial
malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS). MAS transfers reducing equivalents between mitochondria and cytoplasm,
yielding mitochondrial NADH for ATP synthesis while generating cytosolic NAD to sustain glycolysis. Additionally,
the shuttle exchanges glutamate and aspartate that contributes to biosynthetic potential. We propose a novel,
metabolism-coupled mechanism of tumor suppressing LC3C activity: LC3C autophagy targets MAS proteins for
lysosomal degradation in the process of mitophagy. This acts as a checkpoint for glycolysis by regulating
cytosolic NAD/NADH ratio, as well as for SLC25A13-mediated export of aspartate from mitochondria. That
indicates that LC3C metabolically partners with transcriptional effects of VHL inhibiting glycolysis. Moreover, we
hypothesize that selective activation of LC3C autophagy in the proximity to mitochondrial carriers is caused by
2OG derived from glucose through the TCA cycle and transported through the SLC25A11 which activates
EGLN3, leading to P133 hydroxylation. Here we will mechanistically investigate metabolic inputs and functional
output of LC3C autophagy in regard to MAS in the context of renal cancer. Aim 1 will determine role of LC3C
structural elements in the autophagic degradation of SLC25A11/13 and in functional consequences for MAS
activity. We hypothesize that LC3C C-terminal peptide and P133 are necessary and potentially sufficient for this
activity. Aim 2 will identify metabolic effects of LC3C tumor suppressing activity. We hypothesize that LC3C will
(i) inhibit NAD/NADH regeneration and glycolytic activity and (ii) suppress export of aspartate from mitochondria
and its availability for biosynthetic pathways. Aim 3 will determine molecular mechanism by which glucose
regulates LC3C activity. We propose that LC3C autophagy is activated by sensing mitochondrial 2OG levels
through EGLN3-dependent hydroxylation of P133 in the C-terminal peptide. 2OG utilized by EGLN3-LC3C is
derived from glucose and exits mitochondria through SLC25A11, indicating that glucose oxidation is critical for
LC3C autophagic activity."
10911073,"The prevalence of hypertension is markedly increased in patients with autoimmune disorders, and growing
evidence links primary hypertension to immunological changes associated with autoimmunity including the
production of autoantibodies (IgG). The underlying mechanisms by which autoimmunity contributes to the
prevalent hypertension in the general population and U.S. active duty military and veterans remains poorly
understood. This proposal will directly advance our understanding of hypertension during autoimmunity, thus
narrowing a knowledge gap that will ultimately lead to improved treatment of hypertension not only for U.S.
military veterans, but also for patients with primary hypertension. We previously established that 1) an
experimental mouse model closely mimics human SLE including the prevalent hypertension with significant
renal immune cell infiltration; 2) mice with SLE have impaired renal vascular function and renal sodium
handling as an underlying factor in development of hypertension; 3) renal production of reactive oxygen
species is increased, and treatment with general antioxidants attenuates the hypertension in mice with SLE; 4)
immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory treatments protect against the development of hypertension during
SLE in association with reduced renal oxidative stress; and 5) circulating IgG, a critical pathogenic mechanism
of autoimmune diseases, directly contribute to the hypertension in mice with SLE. Taken together, these
studies strongly suggest that immune mediated increases in renal oxidative stress is a fundamental
mechanism leading to the prevalent hypertension during autoimmunity. Despite this evidence, surprisingly little
is understood about the cellular sources of reactive oxygen species in the kidneys, or the intracellular
mechanisms that increase renal oxidative stress during SLE. In a preliminary study, we show that renal
neutrophils are increased in mice with SLE and that these same mice make IgG to myeloperoxidase, an
enzyme essential for the neutrophil oxidative burst and associated with neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)
that are pathogenically linked to autoimmune disease in humans. In addition, we identified IgG raised against
mitochondrial antigens, and have preliminary data showing that mitochondrial respiration is impaired, along
with increased production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. Taken together, these data suggest a
central role for IgG, neutrophils and mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of autoimmune mediated
hypertension. This proposal will examine how NETs and IgG act at the cellular level to cause mitochondrial
dysfunction in a feed forward mechanism. We propose that this feed forward mechanism is propagated by IgG
mediated activation of FcγR, and the subsequent activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Based on our
preliminary and published data, our central hypothesis is that during SLE, NETs initiate mitochondrial damage
in the kidney that leads to the production of IgG raised to mitochondrial antigens. The autoantibodies bind to
FcγR in the kidney and activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, further impairing mitochondrial function. This sets
up a feed forward mechanism of mitochondrial ROS generation that causes renal vascular dysfunction and
increased sodium reabsorption resulting in increased arterial pressure. Using a clinically relevant experimental
model that closely mimics human SLE, this hypothesis will be tested in the following specific aims (1) To test
the hypothesis that during SLE neutrophils are important mediators of renal mitochondrial dysfunction and
mechanistically contribute to the development of hypertension. (2) To test the hypothesis that during SLE,
circulating IgG promotes impaired mitochondrial function through FcγR mediated activation of the
inflammasome, leading to ROS generation, impaired renal function and hypertension. These experiments will
significantly advance our understanding of the underlying pathology for changes in renal function that cause
hypertension both for patients with SLE and for the general population."

Trans women are highly underserved in the response to HIV, especially in the deep south. Southern states are
disproportionately impacted by HIV. Among states in the deep south, which face the vast majority of new HIV infections,
HIV diagnosis rates in Louisiana were second only to Georgia. In New Orleans, our team conducted the first population-
base HIV surveillance study of trans women and 46% tested positive for HIV. These findings are consistent with the most
recent Louisiana Department of Health (LDH) STD/HIV annual report in 2018 that identified Black gay/bisexual men and
transgender women as bearing the largest burden of HIV of any population in Louisiana. Despite the impact of HIV on
trans women in New Orleans, no evidence-based PrEP interventions or efforts are underway to meet community needs. In
response to RFA-MH-21-151 Strengthening HIV Prevention Efforts for Women in the Southern U.S., our team proposes
to test the T'Cher, Take Charge intervention to increase PrEP awareness, uptake, and adherence among trans women in
New Orleans. T'Cher builds off the work conducted to inform and implement the first population-based study of trans
women in 2019 with the adaptation of two evidence-based interventions for trans women recently completed by
investigators. The intervention will include a social media campaign to increase PrEP awareness among trans women. It
will also include peer navigation to build trust among trans people and provide PrEP navigation. We will tailor the peer
navigation model from the Stay Study to be implemented digitally and enhanced using Health eNav methods. Namely, we
will also use motivational interviewing and EMAs to increase health care empowerment and address social determinants
of health barriers to PrEP uptake and adherence. We will recruit 200 trans women to participate in our study using
methods proven successful in our prior HIV research with trans women. Trans women will be engaged in the intervention
for 12 months, providing enough time to address barriers to PrEP and support adherence. The goals of this proposed
T'Cher, Take Charge intervention are: (1) To develop, implement and measure the impact of a T'Cher, Take Charge
social media campaign on PrEP awareness among trans women in New Orleans, LA using a population-based sample of
trans women; (2) To test the impact of the T'Cher, Take Charge digital mHealth peer navigation model on increasing
PrEP uptake and adherence among trans women in New Orleans, LA, using a randomized stepped wedge cross-over study
design; and, (3) To assess changes in health care empowerment and support for social determinants of health as mediating
factors in PrEP uptake and adherence. Our goal is to used lessons learned to adapt promising trans-specific HIV
interventions to meet the HIV prevention needs of trans women in New Orleans, Louisiana. With evidence of
effectiveness, we are prepared to test the intervention at scale throughout Louisiana to strengthen PrEP access and
utilization among trans women Louisiana and throughout the deep south."

Development of platinum resistance is one of the most important factors contributing to ovarian cancer
recurrence and mortality. In our effort to decipher molecular mechanisms underlying platinum resistance, we
performed a kinome-wide screening on platinum-resistant SK-OV3 ovarian cancer cell line and identified Src-
Related Kinase Lacking C-Terminal Regulatory Tyrosine And N-Terminal Myristylation Sites (SRMS) as a top
platinum resistance regulator. Further analysis of TCGA ovarian cancer dataset revealed that patients with high
SRMS expression responded poorly to platinum-based therapy and had worse overall survival. Since knockdown
of SRMS markedly sensitized p53-deficient ovarian cancer cell lines to platinum while only displayed minor effect
on p53-competent cell lines, we reason that SRMS plays a critical role in platinum resistance of p53-deficient
ovarian cancer. To glean the mechanistic insight into the role of SRMS in platinum resistance, we showed that
SRMS prevents JNK activation, possibly by directly phosphorylating JNKs. JNK signaling pathway is well
established as an essential mediator for apoptosis triggered by cytotoxic agents; our observation that SRMS is
specifically involved in platinum resistance in p53-deficient cells suggests that 1) platinum induces apoptosis in
p53-deficient ovarian cancer cells in a JNK signaling pathway-dependent manner because of the defect in p53
signaling pathway-mediated apoptosis; and 2) SRMS-led inhibition of JNK signaling alleviates platinum-induced
apoptosis and thereby promotes platinum resistance in p53-deficient cells. p53 is uniformly deficient in high
grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). The discovery of SRMS’ prominent role in platinum resistance of p53-
deficient cells indicates that SRMS can be an ideal therapeutic target against platinum resistance in HGSOC. In
our “drug repurposing” screening, we found that PLX4720, a selective inhibitor of B-RafV600E, can potently
inhibit SRMS activity. In this application, we propose 3 specific aims: 1) Characterize molecular mechanisms
underlying SRMS-conferred platinum resistance; 2) Define platinum resistance-relevant events that are
governed by SRMS-JNK signaling; and 3) Investigate the potential of targeting SRMS to augment efficacy of
platinum therapy. The success of this application will uncover molecular mechanism underlying SRMS’ role in
platinum resistance of ovarian cancer. Importantly, we will evaluate SRMS-targeted strategy to overcome
platinum resistance in ovarian cancer."

Dr. Richards (Phillips) directs a research group within her laboratory, comprising a Senior Research Associate,
full-time laboratory technicians, a graduate student, and several summer interns. She also directs the
NIH/NIAAA-funded Portland Alcohol Research Center (PARC), which involves 14 research scientists and their
laboratory research personnel. The PARC is working toward the common goal of investigating the role of the
tetrapartite synapse, with components including the pre- and post-synaptic neuron, astroglial processes, and
the extracellular matrix (ECM), in risk for and the impact of chronic alcohol drinking. She has a research
component in the PARC and funded grants supporting methamphetamine (MA) research. Overall, her
laboratory develops and utilizes specialized genetic mouse populations, with the goal of understanding
multifaceted etiologies of risk for addiction and of identifying personalized treatments. The genetic mouse
populations model various aspects of addiction and are then subjected to in-depth study of the transcriptome,
single gene effects, genetically correlated behaviors and neural mechanisms. She studies multiple sensitivity
factors, including drug stimulant effects, reward, reinforcement, aversion, avoidance, cognitive factors, and
physiological correlates. Most recently, her work has placed a particular emphasis on resilient individuals with
strong genetic risk that do not choose high levels of drug intake. She believes that study of these individuals
will provide important information about opposing genes and mechanisms relevant to therapeutic development.
These protective effects are understudied in comparison to use-promoting rewarding drug effects. In fact,
human genetic studies do not include individuals who have experimented with a drug and found it to be
aversive, therefore avoiding its use. Nor have they delved into individual differences as much as population
effects (i.e., common is comparison of non-users and groups with use disorders). Dr. Richards' VA Merit
Review-funded research is focused on binge MA use and the impact of a single nucleotide polymorphism in
the trace amine-associated receptor 1 gene (Taar1m1J), discovered by her lab to account for 60% of the genetic
variance in voluntary MA intake in her selected line genetic animal model. Aims include identifying neurotoxic
effects of MA and the role of Taar1 variation in sensitivity to those effects; and identification of genetic
modifiers of the high risk, Taar1m1J/m1J genotype that predicts high levels of voluntary MA intake, using selective
breeding and transcriptomics. Her funded R01 grant was used to generate knock-in mice to prove that Taar1 is
a quantitative trait gene for MA intake and other MA traits that impact MA intake, including traits that index
sensitivity to MA reward and aversion. Recombinant inbred strains are being used to compare gene network
outcomes in mice that all possess the high risk Taar1m1J/m1J genotype, but exhibit different amounts of MA
intake. Targeted assessment of a potential interactive effect of the mu-opioid receptor gene (Oprm1) indicate
that Oprm1 allelic variation impacts the effect of Taar1 genotype on MA intake and other MA-related traits. Dr.
Richards' research project within the PARC is studying the risk transcriptome for alcohol preference using mice
selectively bred for high or low alcohol preference. She is also performing research designed to dissect
transcriptional differences associated with individual variation in response to genetic risk, by examining gene
expression networks in mice with differential levels of preference from the high alcohol preference line. Finally,
her research group is performing treatment-related research based on transcriptome findings, exploring new
pharmacotherapeutic avenues for alcohol use disorder."

Chronic kidney disease of unknown origin (CKDu) is highly prevalent in several tropical
regions, including Central America where it is most common among young adult males
working in sugarcane and other agricultural activities. It has taken a terrible toll on families
living in vulnerable conditions in rural areas. Despite efforts to study CKDu over the last two
decades, its causes are not fully understood and the disease continues to claim lives and
overwhelm healthcare systems. This project aims to identify risk factors and predictors for
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline among young individuals with and without
CKDu in rural endemic areas in four Central American countries: Costa Rica, Panama,
Nicaragua and Guatemala. We will comprehensively assess multiple risk factors related to
1) strenuous manual labor under heat stress with inadequate rest; 2) social determinants
(e.g., poverty, malnutrition, low birth weight); 3) vector-borne or zoonotic diseases; and 4)
exposure to known or novel toxins (e.g., heavy metals, agrochemicals, silica). We will also
collect bio-banked specimens to assess genetic risk factors and novel biomarkers of acute
kidney injury (AKI), as determined by the NIH Chronic Kidney Diseases of Uncertain Etiology
(CURE) consortium. As a Field Epidemiology Site, our primary study aims are: (a)
identification of cases and controls in endemic agricultural communities; (b) longitudinal
follow-up of both cases and controls; and (c) biopsies in a subset of individuals. Our
proposal takes advantage of the SALTRA network (Central American Program for Health,
Work and Environment). SALTRA has nearly 20 years of experience conducting research in
the region and has longstanding relationships with local communities, organizations and
governmental organizations, public health authorities and local nephrologists on the front

The functional properties of the visual system are most sensitive to disruptions of normal vision during
developmental ‘critical periods’. Interestingly, the critical periods for several functional properties, such as ocular
dominance and acuity, overlap during development. Abnormal vision during these overlapping critical periods,
because of cataracts or misalignment of the two eyes for example, is the cause of amblyopia. Amblyopia is a
prevalent visual disorder in children and can present with any of several visual problems including lower visual
acuity and impaired depth perception. Yet, how depth perception is affected by abnormal vision has remained
elusive. In the proposed research, we investigate the circuit basis for the development and plasticity of depth
perception in the mouse. The development of stereoscopic vision is much slower than other characteristics of
vision and relies on complex properties of binocular disparity. Disparity between the eyes is what produces the
perception of depth. We will characterize multiple dimensions of its development and plasticity by taking
advantage of a natural depth discrimination task that depends on binocular vision. Over this same period, we
will measure with two-photon microscopy how complex disparity properties are refined in the visual cortex and
area LM (a secondary binocular visual area), as well as how and when they are sensitive to abnormal vision.
Understanding the properties of binocular depth perception and the development of those properties will provide
a foundation for developing therapeutic approaches to treat developmental visual disorders such as amblyopia
that cause stereovision deficits."

In response to membrane potential depolarization, voltage-dependent channels undergo a series of
conformational changes from a non-conducting state (closed) to an activated (conducting), finally
stabilizing in a non-conducting inactivated state. K+ channel function has been associated with such basic
cellular functions as the regulation of electrical activity, signal transduction and osmotic balance. In higher
organisms, K+ channel dysfunction may lead to uncontrolled periods of electrical hyperexcytability, like
epileptic episodes, myotonia and cardiac arrhythmia. Consequently, efforts to understand K+ channel
structure function and dynamics relate directly to human health and disease. The continuing long-term
goal of this project is to further understand the molecular mechanisms of gating in voltage-dependent
channels, by focusing on the analysis of K+ channel gating in prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems.
Specifically we will address the following key questions: What are the atomic structures of the key
conformations that determine channel activity? This question will be answered for membrane embedded
systems as well as those ordered in a lattice. What are the molecular bases of voltage-dependent
gating? We will be testing the hypothesis that a specific sliding helix movement (the one click motion) can
explain charge translocation in certain voltage sensors, but perhaps not others. The more charge a sensor
translocates, the larger the number of clicks its sensor needs to move. And how different parts of the channel
interact to define open channel activity? We plan to study these problems by combining spectroscopic
techniques (EPR and NMR), X-ray crystallography electrophysiological and computational methods. We
intend to continue these structure-function studies by investigating a wealth of biochemically-defined
systems from KcsA and KvAP, to the Shaker voltage sensor and the hyperpolarization-activated channel
from Methanococcus janschii (MVP). In addition, we will focus our attention on the voltage-sensing
domain from the Ciona intestinalis-Voltage-Sensor-containing Phosphatase (Ci- VSP) aiming to improve the
resolution of our recent crystals structures. Finally, we will examine the structure of the human voltage-
dependent proton channel Hv1 in membranes though an extensive site-directed spin labeling analysis and
computational modeling. This proposal should open new experimental avenues that will contribute to our
understanding of biologically important events such as electrical signaling, signal transduction and ion
channel gating."

Novelty and surprise have long been known to facilitate learning and memory. At a functional level this makes sense;
unexpected events have to be learned about so they can be predicted and responded to appropriately in the future. At a
psychological level, surprising events have been shown to enhance memory because they induce rehearsal. Subjects tend
to “think about” unexpected events more than familiar ones after they occur. This has been observed directly in humans
(explicit rehearsal) and indirectly in animals (implicit rehearsal). In both cases, the memory enhancement can be
eliminated by disrupting rehearsal with a distractor stimulus that is presented immediately after the novel event.
Presenting the same distractor stimulus several minutes later has no effect. This suggests rehearsal is short-lasting and
distinct from the process of memory consolidation, which stabilizes new information for several hours after learning. In
addition to increasing rehearsal, novel events also trigger the release of norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA), which
are known to enhance synaptic plasticity. Blocking receptors for these neuromodulators in the hippocampus prevents
animals from forming new spatial and contextual memories. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that surprising
events enhance memory because they induce catecholamine release at the same time the hippocampus is actively
rehearsing/replaying new information. Our preliminary data demonstrate that NE and DA are both released in the
hippocampus during and after the presentation of an unexpected aversive stimulus. At the same time, there is an increase
in sharp-wave ripple oscillations (SWRs), which are known to contain replay sequences for recently encountered stimuli.
Consequently, we will test the hypothesis above by monitoring and manipulating catecholamine release in real-time
during an aversive learning task while simultaneously recording oscillations and single unit activity in the hippocampus."

Mutations in Peripherin 2 (PRPH2) account for a significant portion of inherited retinal diseases (IRD).
Delineating the role of PRPH2 in photoreceptor morphogenesis and rim formation is vital to understand how
mutations in a single protein could contribute to such diverse group of pathologies, ranging from retinitis
pigmentosa (RP) to pattern dystrophy (PD) and macular degeneration (MD). Even patients with intrafamilial
mutations can exhibit a notable degree of phenotypic variability, attesting to the complex nature in which PRPH2
functions. My objective in this application is to advance our current knowledge of the role of PRPH2 in outer
segment (OS) formation in order to have a better understanding of disease pathogeneses and for future
development of effective therapeutic strategies. Over the years, our lab has developed an extensive toolbox of
in vitro and in vivo mutant models, and are currently exploring innovative imaging techniques to further our
understanding of the role of Prph2 in OS landscape. Thus far, it has been determined that the association
between Prph2 and its homologue, Rod OS Protein 1 (Rom1), contributes significantly to the phenotypic
variability observed in patients and that lowering Rom1 levels could shift a sever Prph2-assocaited PD phenotype
to milder RP. Furthermore, it is know that the proper function of Prph2 at the disc rim is contingent upon proper
complex assembly of Prph2-oligomers and Prph2/Rom1-complexes. The central focus of this investigation
is to understand how Prph2 and Rom1 function differently in rods and cones with particular interest in
Prph2 homo- and Prph2/Rom1 hetero-complex formation/trafficking, and the effects of Prph2 mutations
on these processes. We propose two aims to address these goals: Aim 1 will assess the role of Rom1 in
cones and the mechanism by which it modulates Prph2-disease phenotypes. By eliminating or overexpressing
Rom1 in Prph2-disease models, we will conduct careful biochemical, structural, and functional analyses to
assess phenotypic differences, as they pertain to complex assembly and OS trafficking. Aim 2 will investigate
the role of interacting partners in the differential behavior of Prph2 in rods vs cones. In order to properly traffic
and function in the OS, Prph2 forms membrane microdomains to organize and house a network of proteins that
are necessary/specific for the formation of the closed rims in rods and open lamellae/rims in cones. In this aim,
we will identify critical Prph2 binding partners and determine how these interactions differ between rods and
cones. The outcomes of these studies will elucidate the specific function of Prph2 and Rom1 in rods and cones,
determine how modulating Rom1 affects disease phenotypes, and will further our understanding of the role of
Prph2 in the closed rim structure in rods and the open rim structures in cones. Given the lack of effective
treatments for Prph2-associated diseases, these studies are essential and bring attention to the role of Rom1 as
a common disease modulator for future development of effective therapeutic strategies."

Lipid storage is a fundamental process for organisms to buffer fluctuations in the availability and need for
metabolic energy. Lipids are predominantly stored as neutral lipids, such as triacylglycerols (TGs), in
organelles called lipid droplets (LDs). In conditions of excess metabolic energy, cells convert carbohydrates
to fatty acids and esterify them, along with dietary fatty acids, to glycerol-3-phosphate to form TG.
Conversely, when fatty acids are needed as metabolic fuel or as precursors for membrane components,
TGs are hydrolyzed. Whether or not cells have lipid stores directly impacts their ability to grow and divide,
as well as their physiology and need to import nutrients. Through a combination of unbiased genetic and
biochemical screens, we recently found that all members of the MLX family of transcription factors localize
to the LD surfaces as LDs accumulate in cells. These transcription factors include MLX and its obligate
dimerization partners, MLXIP/MondoA or MLXIPL/MondoB/ChREBP, which detect glucose derivatives and
are key regulators of glucose and lipid metabolism. Deficiency of ChREBP has also been linked to the
developmental disorder Williams-Beuren syndrome and to features of the metabolic syndrome.
Based on extensive preliminary data, we suggest a model in which the accumulation of LDs serves to
attenuate the transcriptional response of MLX:ChREBP or MLX:MondoA targets in response to glucose.
We will test this model defining the mechanism and regulation of MLX-type transcription factor targeting to
LDs and elucidating how this modulates their response to glucose.
Completing these aims will reveal a fundamental aspect of metabolic coordination through a fascinating,
novel paradigm of transcriptional control. It may also have important implications for human health.
Overaccumulation of LDs is the hallmark of metabolic disease linked to obesity, a problem of pandemic
proportions. Our findings will shed new light on physiological sequelae of LD accumulation, possibly
providing therapeutic avenues for intervention."

HIV continues to be a significant public health problem throughout sub-Saharan Africa, including in Malawi.
Sexually transmitted infection (STI) care settings are underutilized venues to simultaneously reach virally
unsuppressed people with HIV (PWH) and those at high risk of HIV and have the potential to optimize HIV
prevention and treatment outcomes. Hazardous alcohol use is widespread in Malawi and among people
receiving STI care and is a critical barrier to the success of HIV prevention efforts. TrEAT is a brief, highly
effective, culturally appropriate, scalable, evidence-based intervention (EBI) for alcohol reduction. While
culturally appropriate for diverse settings, TrEAT has not been adapted for the shifting HIV care environment
that includes both PWH and people at high risk for HIV. Through preliminary work, our team has demonstrated
that: 1) Hazardous alcohol use is highly prevalent among people receiving STI care in SSA, including Malawi;
2) TrEAT is culturally appropriate, feasibile, acceptable, and effective at reducing alcohol use and improving
viral suppression among PWH across global settings, including in SSA; and 3) Successfully led alcohol
reduction and HIV prevention and treatment effectiveness and implementation studies. The overall goal for this
R34 application is to produce a culturally adapted, scalable HIV ‘status-neutral’ EBI for alcohol reduction and
HIV prevention and treatment optimization to test in an R01 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial. We will
conduct a 2-arm pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing TrEAT4All to usual care to assess the
preliminary efficacy and implementation of HIV prevention and treatment within one STI care setting which
serves as an early Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) implementation site in Lilongwe, Malawi. Drawing from
our previous manualized interventions, we will develop a 3-session intervention, TrEAT4All, that integrates HIV
prevention and treatment counseling into TrEAT to improve HIV prevention outcomes—PrEP use for those
who are at risk for HIV and viral suppression for PWH. Our specific aims are to 1) Adapt TrEAT, an EBI for
alcohol reduction, to integrate HIV status-neutral counseling (TrEAT4All) for PWH and those at high risk of HIV
who report heavy drinking and are receiving STI care in Malawi; 2) Evaluate short-term efficacy and
implementation of TrEAT4All for optimizing HIV prevention and treatment outcomes (viral suppression among
PWH; PrEP use among those at high risk of HIV) and proportion of heavy drinking days in past 30 days; and 3)
Explore pathways of TrEAT4All responsiveness among intervention participants. Results will have relevance
for integrating alcohol reduction EBIs into real-world STI care settings to optimize HIV prevention and
treatment programs throughout sub-Saharan Africa and other regions where alcohol plays a role in HIV
spread."
10913989,"The overall goals of the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics (Bioanalysis) Core are to improve the quality, and
increase the quantity of research conducted by NEI-R01 holders in the Atlanta (AVRC). This is done through
better and faster biostatistics and informatics approaches than those that the typical PI can conduct by himself
without Core support. The Bioanalysis staff benefits from formal rigorous mathematical training in biostatistics
and informatics for interpretation of experimental results, so that NEI-R01 PIs do not need as much
biostatistics and informatics training to effectively design experiments and interpret results. The Bioanalysis
Core:
1. Provides better resources and more convenient access to state of the art analysis tools than an NEIR01
PI could provide or support alone.
2. Consults with PIs to determine scope of a project, timeframe, services needed.
3. Conducts work that would otherwise require hiring of bioinformatics and biostatistics experts that is
impractical for an R01 budget.
4. Provides training to PIs and personnel as appropriate for more routine tasks.
5. Pre-tests and troubleshoots data and software from bleeding edge technologies to avoid repeated mistakes
by multiple individual PIs.
These Aims serve to maximize the utility of each R01 experiment and enables experiments that otherwise
could not be conducted or analyzed. The Bioanalysis Core leverages and facilitates usage of university level
resources and talents from among the five institutions that make up the AVRC."
10701861,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – Autonomic Biomarker Core
While many symptoms and signs of autonomic nervous system (ANS) disorder are found in patients with
persistent post-concussive symptoms (PPCS), ANS function in concussion has been extraordinarily
understudied, particularly in adolescents. Despite the limited number of studies, there is clear evidence of
ANS dysfunction sub-acutely and chronically following concussion. In a recent systematic review, 33/36 studies
identified ANS anomalies in concussed athletes and non-athletes. The most consistent findings are lower
parasympathetic activity during rest and activities that normally enhance parasympathetic response, such as
deep breathing, as well as activities that normally enhance sympathetic response, such as orthostatic challenge.
There are, however, major limitations in existing studies including very few studies of adolescents, small to
modest sample sizes (~20 patients), and limited sets of ANS measures or autonomic challenges used in any
one study. Because of these methodological limitations, prior studies do not provide clear guidance as to the
best set of measures and testing conditions to assess ANS function in adolescents with PPCS. We will develop
a comprehensive, scalable assessment of ANS function in adolescents. Among the many innovative features of
this panel are: 1) both cardiovascular and pupillary measures of sympathetic and parasympathetic function, and
2) a standardized set of brief physiological challenges to assess both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity.
We use rest, recovery, and deep breathing protocols to maximize sensitivity for detecting parasympathetic
dysfunction. We use an orthostatic challenge and a psychological stressor to maximize sensitivity for detecting
sympathetic dysfunction. Heart rate variability as well as heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure will be
recorded concurrently during these activities. We use pupillometry as a complementary non-cardiac assessment
of autonomic dysfunction. We will also 3) develop norms by age and gender for all of the measures in the panel
that can be incorporated into clinical decision-making. The broad range of ANS measures and testing conditions
used here will identify the measures and testing conditions that best predict the persistence of concussive
symptoms. This panel of measures will be used to characterize one or more ANS endophenotypes linked to
clusters of PPCS symptoms. The panel of ANS measures developed here will help elucidate the pathobiologies
underlying PPCS by examining the link between ANS and central nervous system markers and blood-based
markers of axonal injury and neuroinflammation."
10701862,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – Imaging Biomarker Core
The CARE4Kids Center Without Walls Project aims to discover measurable biomarkers of persistent post-
concussive symptoms (PPCS) and use these markers to characterize subgroups (endophenotypes) that will
inform prognosis and potential treatment. Advanced neuroimaging offers great promise in revealing how
concussion affects brain structure and function, but relatively small sample sizes have limited the reliability and
generalizability of imaging studies to date. The overall goal of the Imaging Biomarker Core is to collect state-of-
the-art multimodal brain imaging data that is maximally informative about outcomes in children and adolescents
with concussion. Multimodal imaging will be collected in the Development Cohort, at baseline only, and used to
develop and test models of outcome prediction that will be examined in the Validation Cohort. The neuroimaging
protocol is designed to maximize data quality and minimize discomfort for our injured, younger patient population
and is based on existing multi-site efforts (i.e., ABCD, UK Biobank) and NINDS imaging recommendations. The
Imaging Biomarker Core has the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: Discover which multimodal brain
imaging measures best predict clinical outcomes in concussion (separately, and when combined with other
biomarkers and clinical measures). Specific Aim 2: Neuroimaging site qualification and training – site
qualification using pilot data and coordinated training will prepare sites to collect high-quality data. Specific Aim
3: Collect high-quality multimodal brain MRI – 360 participants will be scanned across 6 sites in the Development
Cohort. Specific Aim 4: Ongoing data quality control – ongoing quality control through phantoms, volunteers,
and data review will ensure high-quality data that is maximally comparable across sites. Specific Aim 5: Analyze
Data: Transfer images and derived measures to the University of Utah Data Coordinating Center (U-DCC) to
disseminate to the research community. We will use standardized, validated, publicly-available protocols to
process the neuroimaging data. Measures of regional brain volumes, cortical geometry, white matter
organization, functional connectivity, perfusion, and neuropathology (i.e., microbleeds and white matter
hyperintensities) will be compared between groups and examined for correlation with outcome measures. In
addition to these simpler approaches, working with the U-DCC, we will employ machine learning approaches to
identify which combination of imaging, demographic, and clinical measures best predicts functional outcome."
10701863,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – Blood Biomarker Core
Concussions affect nearly 3 million Americans annually (up to 1.9 million under the age of 18), with up to 15-
30% not recovered 3 months after injury. The risk of concussion is 5 times higher among early and middle
adolescents (EMA) than any other age group, highlighting the need to focus on this at-risk population. Because
early and middle adolescence is a critical period for neurodevelopment processes required for optimal cognitive,
emotional, and executive functioning, EMAs may be at increased risk for the burden of long-term symptoms and
deficits after concussion. Clinical trials to develop symptom-targeted therapies to facilitate recovery and to
prevent long-term disability among EMAs are urgently needed. To optimize future trials, an accurate, prospective
identification of those at the greatest risk for persistent post-concussive symptoms (PPCS; post-concussive
symptoms lasting >3 months) and who would benefit from preventive interventions is essential. The overall goal
of CARE4Kids is to identify and validate the most sensitive, specific, and scalable biomarkers to stratify PPCS
risk and identify underlying endophenotypes. These biomarkers fall into 3 broad categories: blood-based,
neuroimaging, and autonomic. The Blood Biomarker Core (BBC) will provide the necessary resources and
technical expertise to collect, measure and analyze a panel of blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) reflecting key
physiologic post-concussion processes, including axonal injury, inflammation, membrane turnover, oxidative
stress and altered neurotransmission. Specific Aim 1: The BBC will make technically robust measurements of
prospective blood biomarkers including neuronal/glial proteins, lipids, inflammatory cytokines, and neuropeptide
neurotransmitters using well-validated analytic approaches. Data quality will be assured by compliance with
standard operating procedures and continuous evaluation of technical reproducibility. Data will be reported to
the Data Coordinating Core (DCC). Specific Aim 2: The BBC will work closely with BioSEND and the DCC to
ensure that blood collection, storage, and measurement protocols are standardized across all study sites,
including 1) the use of National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Common Data Elements related
to biomarker collection, 2) ongoing training of study personnel, and 3) ongoing quality control. Specific Aim 3:
The BBC will interact with the Administrative Core and integrate with the Imaging Biomarker Core and Autonomic
Biomarker Core to determine how BBMs may enhance characterization of PPCS endophenotypes and improve
accuracy of PPCS prediction by 1) characterizing BBM-specific measures in relation to PPCS endophenotypes,
and 2) analyzing BBM data. At the conclusion of this project, we will not only develop a PPCS risk stratification
algorithm that is practical, scalable, and accurate, we will identify the unique contribution of BBMs to PPCS in
EMAs. Our results have potential to identify potentially modifiable inflammatory pathways and to elucidate the
biologic mechanism underlying symptomatic recovery in this age group."
10701866,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – Research Project
Concussion or mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is the most common type of acquired brain injury in children
and adolescents. While the majority of youth with concussion recover within 2-4 weeks, a substantial subset
(15-30%) take longer to recover and develop persistent post-concussive symptoms (PPCS). This group
experiences worse function, more pain and seeks a greater amount of medical assessments and treatments.
Prolonged impairments in early and middle adolescents (EMA) can result in changes in developmental trajectory
and long-term disability. There is no single agreed upon definition for PPCS and predictive algorithms are largely
based on nonspecific subjective clinical symptoms. Furthermore, there are currently no good preventive
strategies or targeted treatments. It is a major public health challenge to develop objective biological markers
that better predict PPCS, which will provide the opportunity for improved prognostication, potential preventive
interventions and new therapeutics based on underlying biological mechanisms. It is the central goal of this
CARE4Kids Center Without Walls to discover objective autonomic, imaging and blood-based biomarkers
that, when integrated with neuropsychological and neurological signs and symptoms, will optimally
predict PPCS in EMA. Once identified, these biomarkers and clinical measures will then be validated in a more
generalized group and developed into an improved predictive algorithm for PPCS. The linkage of objective
biological measures to different clinical phenotypes (termed endophenotypes in this application) will provide a
mechanistic understanding of different types of PPCS. It is hypothesized that endophenotypes may share
pathobiology with migraine, dysautonomia, anxiety, depression or other symptoms commonly seen in those with
PPCS. By understanding the underlying neurobiology of PPCS, it will become possible to develop mechanism-
based prevention or treatment measures."

single cell technologies on dissociated tissues and on intact tissue sections to study this biology. We will
coordinate with our KAPP-Sen Biospecimen Core to obtain high-quality human normal kidney, pancreas,
placenta, and adipose tissue. By employing unbiased, sequencing-based, single-cell resolution methods, we will
generate high-content spatially resolved data to enable the identification of senescent cells. We will work with
our KAPP-Sen Data Analysis Core to discover comprehensive mRNA biomarkers for human senescent cells. A
selection of target epitopes derived from these biomarkers will be detected within tissue sections at high

human tissues and ex vivo and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models will further inform and validate
senescence signatures, and identify associated epigenomic features, within intact human tissues.
The Biological Analysis Core will achieve its objectives through the following Aims:
Aim 1. To establish optimal tissue dissociation and preparation techniques to implement both dissociative and
spatially-resolved single-cell transcriptome methods for the identification of senescent cells in human tissues.
Aim 2. To scale and standardize the pipeline to generate high-quality, high-resolution, and high-throughput
datasets and construct maps of cellular senescence in the four target tissues.
Aim 3. To identify mRNA biomarkers of human senescent cells and construct and apply a multiplex antibody
panel derived from these.
Aim 4. Leverage ex vivo human models to further characterize the functional features of senescent cells.
Together, this analytic approach will define the comprehensive tissue signature of senescence at 1 µm resolution
and begin to uncover the molecular foundations of the senescent cell and its response to therapy. In addition,
the data set generated will provide insight into senescence-associated secreted proteins that may inform the
design of blood biomarker of senescence. Altogether, our approach and its associated tools will be applicable
across a wide array of human tissues types."

Advanced Imaging Core C is essential to accurately define spatial and temporal organization of processes
governing macrophage plasticity. Surface markers determined by flow cytometry have been primarily used to
identify and sort diverse macrophage subpopulations. However, each Project makes clear that macrophage
diversity is fundamentally a consequence of specific spatiotemporal intracellular signaling and coordinated
transcriptional programming dictated by the niche environment. These processes control macrophage plasticity
during both inflammatory lung injury and its resolution. All Projects will address how inter-cellular and paracrine
signals interact with intracellular cues to alter macrophage fate in response to lung injury and resolution. Thus,
the function of Core C is to provide advanced reagents and imaging methodologies required for both in vitro and
in vivo studies and enable testing of hypotheses in each Project. We will provide the tools to address the
fundamental question that a given signaling pathway or transcriptional program is essential for the active
regulation of macrophage differentiation, specialization, and function. To gain the mechanistic signaling insights
needed for the success of each Project, Core C will provide methods at both conventional and super-resolution
levels to interrogate the signaling pathways in live macrophages. Spatiotemporal metabolic, transcriptional, and
signaling landscape changes in response to macrophage activation by ATP, β-catenin, CREB, STAT family
transcription factors and other key signals will be studied by multi-color super-resolution microscopy and super-
resolution activity imaging. These analyses of macrophages will permit a fine-grained assessment of the time-
sequence and spatial organization of the programs employed by macrophage variants. Although intravital
imaging is the most direct way to interrogate lung injury and recovery outcomes, respiratory motion in the live
animal represents a major obstacle for obtaining meaningful results by in vivo lung imaging. Thus, a major Core
C function will also be to provide advanced two-photon intravital lung imaging using a novel approach to reliably
identify myeloid cells in living mouse lung (in vessels and tissue) and track single cell motion, allowing each
Project to directly examine the functional effects of their pathway of interest during lung injury and repair phases.
By providing a seamless visual examination of signaling activity in macrophages as they differentiate, migrate,
and resolve immune challenges, Core C is essential for the Program’s overall success."

A critical translational component of this Program Project involves the correlative analysis of macrophages (Mφ)
isolated from critically ill patients suffering from sepsis, pneumonia, and other acute insults that result in the
devastating clinical syndrome of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The Patient Sampling and
Genomics Core (Core D) will perform the central function of collecting these Mφ samples and establishing and
maintaining a clinical database of disease severity. Feasibility for obtaining sufficient samples for the proposed
studies will be greatly enhanced through extensive utilization of a non-bronchoscopic BAL (NBBAL) approach,
which results in diagnostic yields similar to bronchoscopic BAL and has an excellent safety profile in critically ill
patients requiring mechanical ventilation. In addition, blood will be collected for isolation of peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for comparison with lung samples. Longitudinal samples will be collected from a
subset of patients. Additionally, Core D will provide biostatistical analysis on these clinical samples as well as
bioinformatic analysis on samples from all Projects, including bulk RNA-seq analysis, and single-cell RNA-seq
(scRNA-seq) processing and analysis, as described in the individual Projects. A spectrum of clinical severity will
be obtained to correlate disease outcomes with flow cytometric, transcriptomic, and functional analyses of Mφs,
focusing on pathways relevant to each of the four Projects.
 Innovative aspects of this Core include the following: a) development of an unique biorepository of lung
Mφ samples from patients with ARDS, including longitudinal samples from a subset of patients to characterize
changes in lung Mφ populations during the phases of ARDS; b) scRNA-seq analysis of patient lung Mφ,
representing a substantial methodological advance in Mφ analysis compared to other recent studies; c) extensive
utilization of the NBBAL approach to greatly enhance sample collection since it can be performed safely and
with high yield by respiratory therapists and fellow trainees; d) an integrated Core structure that combines patient
sample acquisition with biostatistical and bioinformatic expertise and resources to maximize efficient utilization
of these clinical data; e) sample collection from a diverse ICU patient population of under-represented and
insufficiently studied groups (30-40% African-American and 30-40% Hispanic/Latino patients). f) Comparison of
expression profiles in lung Mφ populations from ARDS patients with circulating PBMCs after removal of
lymphocytes, which will improve the reported poor correlation between these sample types; g) inclusion of
immune paralysis as phenotypic characterization of patient samples, which has not been evaluated in past
studies of ARDS AMφ clinical samples; h) enhanced focus on sepsis and pneumonia-induced ARDS as the
primary etiologies characterized by intensive lung Mφ analysis."
10895343,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Macrophages (Mφ) are essential for the innate immune function of lungs. The ability of macrophages to
integrate signals from microbes and the tissue niche and to polarize can either promote or resolve
inflammatory lung injury. Project 1 shows a fundamental role of the extracellular ATP (e[ATP]) activated- and
[Ca2+]in-sensitive cooperation between the purinergic receptor P2RX7 (Purinergic Receptor 2 subtype X7) and
potassium (K+) channel TWIK2 (Two-pore domain Weak Inwardly rectifying K+ channel 2) that is essential for
determining the macrophage phenotype. We show that e[ATP], the canonical P2RX7 ligand, governs Mφ
polarization through controlling [Ca2+]in and that activation of the TWIK2 K+ efflux channel induces the transition
to the pro-inflammatory state. We also observed that the TWIK2 response was itself dependent on the
activation of P2RX7 by e[ATP] and resultant Ca2+ influx. Thus, Project 1, we will investigate the interactions
between Ca2+ influx mediated by P2RX7 and its tuning of K+ efflux mediated by TWIK2, which we hypothesize
determines the transition to either pro-inflammatory Mφ (Inf-Mφ) or reparative Mφ (Rep-Mφ) fate via activation
of distinct downstream signaling pathways. This hypothesis will be tested by addressing the following Specific
Aims. Aim 1 will define respective mechanisms of P2RX7 and TWIK2 activation in mediating the shift in lung
macrophage polarity. Aim 2 will define the signaling pathways downstream of Mφ ion channels that promote
and resolve inflammatory lung injury. We posit that by identifying P2RX7 and TWIK2 activation and signaling
mechanisms responsible for macrophage phenotype switching, and by testing the role of P2RX7 in
coordinating the function of TWIK2 in the initial inflammatory response followed subsequent anti-inflammatory
response in Project 1, it will be possible to develop strategies to more effectively resolve inflammatory lung
injury and to make lung’s tolerance to injury through controlling macrophage polarization enhancing bacterial
killing function of MФ."
10895348,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The lung’s ability to recover from severe inflammatory injury depends on its capacity to rapidly mobilize intrinsic
tissue repair pathways. Macrophages (Mɸ), the most abundant sentinel immune cell in lungs, have different
lineages and functions. A key, but poorly understood, aspect of these cells is their intrinsic property to promote
repair after lung injury. In the basal state, the lung contains alveolar Mɸ (AMɸ) (CD11c+/CD11b-/SiglecF+) as
well as a population of interstitial Mɸ (IMɸ) (CD11b+/CX3CR1+/SiglecF-). AMɸ are necessary for restoring lung
homeostasis after lung injury but the mechanisms regulating reparative AMɸ generation remain elusive. It is
clear that a reparative AMɸ population needs to be efficiently and rapidly mobilized, in particular, in the face of
sharp decrease in their number during lung infection and injury. In Project 2, we will address this question based
on the seminal observation that the transcription factor cAMP Response Element Binding (CREB) plays a key
role in giving rise to a reparative AMɸ lineage. In support of this concept, we show that the myeloid-specific
deletion of CREB in mice (Creb∆LyzM mice) resulted in the generation of immature AMɸ
(CD11c+/CD11b+/SiglecFlo), which give rise to inflammatory AMɸ, thus subverting the anti-inflammatory and
reparative function of mature AMɸ. These mice thereby showed clear evidence of lung injury in the basal state
due to the increase in inflammatory AMɸ. Furthermore, lung injury in these mice after LPS was prolonged and
agonal. They showed significantly greater mortality than controls. By studying flow-sorted Mɸ from Creb∆LyzM
lungs, we also found alterations in the expression of regulatory genes such as Pparγ , an essential driver of
reparative AMɸ lineage specification, as well as genes regulating AMɸ metabolism and immune responses.
Further analysis showed that CREB induced the expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4). PDK4
in turn suppressed the translocation of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) from mitochondria to the
nucleus, thus inhibiting the production of nuclear acetyl-CoA. In the absence of CREB and its target PDK4, PDC
activity was markedly increased which resulted in excessive nuclear acetyl-CoA levels, increased histone
acetylation, and the generation of AMɸ, that were incapable of promoting lung repair. Based on these
observations and with the availability of powerful tools generated by the Cores, in Project 2 we will define the
central role of CREB in generating a pro-resolving AMɸ population through the epigenetic regulation of Pparγ
expression. Our Specific Aims are (Aim 1): to address the role of CREB in mediating the generation of a lung
reparative AMɸ population following lung injury, and (Aim 2): to investigate the role of CREB in signaling the
generation of AMɸ by epigenetically upregulating Pparγ expression. Based on the provocative phenotype of
Creb∆LyzM mice, we believe understanding how reparative AMɸ are generated and enhancing their generation
during injury holds great promise for developing lung repair strategies."
10891478,"SUMMARY
 Preterm infants born between 21 to 30 gestational weeks (GW) have 20-40% chance of developing germinal
matrix hemorrhage (GMH), which is a leading cause of neonatal mortality and neurodevelopmental disorders,
such as cerebral palsy. Despite decades of research, however, there has been no significant improvement in
the prevalence of preterm birth and the mechanism leading to GMH remains unclear. To understand the cause(s)
for GMH, we have shown that, during the second trimester, germinal matrix contains enriched populations of
Nestin+ radial glia and DCX+ neuroblasts that are fated to become GABAergic interneurons. Furthermore, DCX+
neuroblasts in the germinal matrix are organized as distinct clusters, called DCX-Enriched Nests or DENs, where
they expand and migrate to the cerebral cortex and other deep nuclei before becoming mature GABAergic
interneurons and integrating into the local neural circuits. To investigate why blood vessels in the germinal matrix
are particularly vulnerable to develop GMH, we combined histological and ultrastructural analyses, fluorescence-
activated cell sorting (FACS), and single-cell transcriptomics to characterize the properties of nascent blood
vessels in the prenatal human brain from 15 to 25 GW. These studies lead to three main conclusions. First,
during the second trimester the vascular network in the germinal matrix is much more complex than other brain
regions. These nascent blood vessels are tiled by an ensemble of endothelial cells and mural cells, which follow
distinct developmental trajectories and use diverse signaling mechanisms to facilitate cell-cell communication
and maturation. Second, endothelial cells from younger brain (15-18 GW) exhibit stage-specific transcriptomic
and bioenergetic features that are different from those from 20-23 GW. In addition, microglia-vasculature
interactions stage-dependently promote angiogenesis in the germinal matrix, but not in the cortical plate. Finally,
transcriptomic profiling of CD45+ cells in GMH cases showed that proinflammatory neutrophils and monocytes
utilize antibacterial factors and CXCL16-S1PR1 signaling, respectively, to disrupt nascent vasculature in the
germinal matrix. Collectively, our results support the overarching hypothesis that proinflammatory
neutrophils and monocytes produce cytotoxic factors to disrupt angiogenesis and neurogenesis in the
germinal matrix of preterm infants with GMH. To test this hypothesis, we propose to (1) characterize the
cytotoxic properties of neutrophil-produced antibacterial factors in disrupting angiogenesis, (2) determine the
impacts of CXCL16-S1PR1-mediated signaling in angiogenesis in the germinal matrix, and (3) examine the
impacts of GMH on the neurogenesis and migration of GABAergic interneurons. Results from this project will
provide important insights into disease mechanism of, and therapeutic targets for, GMH."

Histone proteins package and organize DNA into chromatin, which regulates every DNA-dependent process.
Alterations to chromatin structure is a hallmark of aging and is characterized by global changes in gene
expression, histone abundance, histone PTM landscape, and chromatin accessibility. I propose that tight control
over histone abundance and histone type, which we term histone homeostasis, is essential for normal cellular
aging. Cells contain two histone types: canonical histones that are expressed during S phase of the cell cycle,
and variant histones that are expressed throughout the cell cycle and in non-dividing cells. Variant histones are
of particular interest to aging because they are the only source of new histones in non-dividing cells and
accumulate with age. Additionally, variant histone misregulation results in chromatin defects and reduced
lifespan. Knowing how canonical and variant histones regulate genome function is integral to understanding
normal and pathological chromatin-based aging processes. Canonical histone H3.2 and variant histone H3.3 are
some of the most highly conserved proteins across eukaryotes. The high conservation of amino acid differences
between canonical H3.2 and variant H3.3 suggests that they may perform unique functions in the genome, yet
it is not understood if variant H3.3 function is mediated by its cell-cycle independent expression or unique protein
sequence. In Drosophila, I have discovered that variant H3.3 is essential for development when canonical
histone gene copy number is reduced, suggesting a previously unknown requirement for coordination between
canonical H3.2 and variant H3.3 expression. However, the mechanisms underlying this coordination are
unknown. The proposed project tests the hypotheses that variant H3.3 is required for normal chromatin-based
aging processes and that cells possess a homeostatic mechanism to maintain the correct relative expression of
canonical H3.2 and variant H3.3 throughout development. The aims of this project are to (1) determine the
contributions of H3.3 expression versus protein sequence to chromatin-based aging processes and, (2) elucidate
the mechanisms that achieve proper H3 abundance through the coordination of canonical and variant histone
expression. This work will expand the fundamental understanding of how canonical and variant histones
cooperate to regulate genome function during aging."
11056676,"Project Abstract
Breast cancer remains the second-leading cause of cancer-related death in the US. Obesity is an established
risk factor for several aggressive breast cancer subtypes, and is also associated with increased breast cancer
metastasis and mortality. On a mechanistic level, diet-induced obesity drives dysregulation of lipid metabolism
that results in greater extracellular fatty acid availability, providing a rich energy source for tumor proliferation
and migration. While this has been shown to increase the severity of breast cancer progression and metastasis,
the therapeutic potential of this metabolic relationship has not yet been investigated. Dependent upon fatty acid
availability and linked to metastatic progression of several cancer types, ferroptosis, a mechanism of cell death
caused by lipid peroxidation, serves as a targetable mediator between obesity, fatty acid metabolism, and breast
cancer progression. Our preliminary findings support the ferroptosis-metastasis link and suggest obesity-induced
dysregulation of fatty acid metabolism may exacerbate this relationship. This proposal will use murine models of
obesity and metastatic mammary cancer in concert with several advanced mechanistic approaches, including
lipidomic quantification of tumor and plasma as well as high-throughput RNA sequencing for assessing
transcriptional regulation of lipid metabolism in the primary and metastatic tumor microenvironment, to rigorously
test the hypothesis that dysregulation of fatty acid metabolism associated with obesity promotes sensitivity to
ferroptosis in murine models of TNBC. This hypothesis will be tested with two integrated specific aims:
Aim 1. Quantify the impact of obesity and ferroptosis induction on murine mammary tumor growth, metastasis,
and fatty acid metabolism in vivo. To isolate the effect of fatty acid availability from other components of the
tumor microenvironment, in vitro exposure to serum from control or DIO mice will be used to assess changes in
sensitivity to inhibition of xCT and GPX4 in TNBC.
Aim 2. Determine whether the enzyme pyruvate carboxylase (PC), uniquely involved in both fatty acid and
glutamate metabolism, protects against ferroptosis in obesity by assessing if suppression of PC promotes
sensitivity to ferroptosis in both primary and metastatic tumors of DIO mice. Transcriptional dysregulation of lipid
and glutamate metabolism in obese and control shPC TNBC tumors, comparing primary and metastatic tumors,
will be quantified via RNAseq.
This proposal aims to define molecular characteristics of fatty acid metabolism enriched in breast cancer of
patients with obesity to identify therapeutic targets that can decrease breast cancer mortality by limiting tumor

mentoring from Dr. Hursting, and a focused training plan, this fellowship will provide a critical foundation for
developing my future career as an independently-funded scientist in the fields of nutrition and cancer metabolism."

 Highly ordered, directed movement in collective cell migration is a result of the magnitude of coordination
and communication that takes place at both the cellular and tissue level. In this proposal, we focus on
understanding the mechanisms that contribute to the system behaving as a ‘collective’ to achieve such
phenomenon. The cardiopharyngeal progenitors of the tunicate Ciona provide the simplest model of collective
cell migration, with cohesive bilateral cell pairs polarizing and migrating between the ventral epidermis and trunk
endoderm. Bernadskaya & Yue et al. 2021 found that the collective cell migration of Ciona exhibits supracellular
characteristics; while each cell has the machinery to migrate individually, for successful development, the cells
travel together and take on the identity of either the ‘leader’ or ‘trailer’. How this collective polarity is established
and communicated between the two cells, and the type of information being exchanged, remains to be
elucidated. We propose that this collective migration is driven by a “rear-engine” with supracellular polarity, as
mechanical information flows from the trailer cell to the leader cell. We speculate that the cell:cell junction serves
as a point of plasticity; preliminary work has shown that the junction has relatively low levels of actomyosin,
allowing it to be under low tension and easily deformable. We hypothesize the two cells are utilizing cell shape
– specifically the direction and degree of deformation at the cell:cell junction – and hydrostatic pressure as a
method for mechanical coupling. To test our hypothesis, we will use in vivo images to reverse-engineer forces,
extract force measurements, and build computational models of migration. Then, we will experimentally validate
the role of the cell:cell junction as an information hub contributing to supracellular polarity, cytoskeletal
organization, as well as force generation and transmission."

The enteric nervous system (ENS) is critical for controlling key intestinal functions such as peristalsis and nutrient
absorption. Emerging paradigms indicate that interactions between neurons and immune cells fundamentally
impact immunity and inflammation in peripheral tissues. Recently, it has been shown that the ENS can act on
the intestinal immune system to modify the function of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs). However, despite these
advances, the role of ILCs in ENS function remains unexplored. In my preliminary studies, I defined that ILCs
are genetically poised to interact with the ENS and support their development or function. By examining a specific
factor produce by ILCs, I defined how it is regulated and developed a lineage-specific knockout to demonstrate
this pathway plays a role in augmenting the ENS. To goals of this proposal are, in Aim 1, to utilize in vivo and ex
vivo models to determine the molecular mechanisms that regulate ILCs and associated factors, and, in Aim 2,
to determine the cellular mechanisms by which ILC-derived factors impacts the ENS and the importance of this
interaction in maintaining ENS homeostasis during inflammation. Collectively, these two aims will critically define
a novel molecular mechanism by which ILCs impact ENS function in states of intestinal health and disease,
which could provoke novel preventative, therapeutic or curative strategies. Further, it will create an outstanding
training opportunity for my continued development in science and eventual transition to become an independent
academic researcher."

Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite and causative infectious agent of ocular toxoplasmosis
(OT). This chronic, recurrent infection is the top cause of infectious retinitis worldwide and can lead to
blindness in one eye in 25% of patients. Current treatment does not positively influence visual outcomes. T.
gondii resides in a parasitophorous vacuole and induces mechanisms that block autophagosome-lysosome
formation from targeting the parasite in infected cells. After parasite invasion, T. gondii activates the host cell
signaling molecule, Src, which drives prolonged autophosphorylation of the EGFR and activates the
downstream autophagy inhibitor, Akt. Activated Akt persistently avoids autophagic targeting and survival within
the cell. Previously, EGFR inhibition was shown to induce autophagic killing of T. gondii in approximately half of
the cells and is partially protective against OT. This partial protection may be a result of partial Akt inhibition
and the restricted expression of EGFR. Thus, Src is likely a better target because it appears to activate Akt
independently of EGFR and is broadly and highly expressed in neural tissue and the retina. This project seeks
to understand the host signaling mechanism utilized by T. gondii in cells lacking EGFR that prevent
autophagy-mediated targeting of the parasite, to understand the molecular events triggered by Src inhibition
that are responsible for selective targeting of T. gondii by autophagy, and to determine whether Src inhibition
protects against OT. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that knockdown of Src induces parasite killing in cells
lacking EGFR through an autophagy-mediated mechanism. Additionally, Src inhibition induces autophagic
targeting that appears dependent on the activation of a protein kinase. Therefore, the central hypothesis of this
proposal is that, even in the absence of EGFR, Src inhibition kills T. gondii due to protein kinase-dependent
selective targeting by autophagosomes, and Src inhibition controls OT. Experiments proposed in Aim 1 will
investigate the role of Src in preventing the autophagic killing of T. gondii in the absence of EGFR in vitro.
Experiments proposed in Aim 2 will explore the role of protein kinase activation in selective parasite targeting
by autophagosomes after Src inhibition. Aim 3 will explore the effects of Src inhibition on pre-established OT in
vivo. Together these data will define mechanisms in which T. gondii inhibits autophagic targeting, explain how
autophagy selectively targets the parasite and may be applied to improved treatment for OT."
10830262,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Repetitive head impacts in contact sports are a significant public health concern due to their potential association
with short- and long-term neurological deficits. There is debate amongst researchers as to the amount of
exposure that may lead to neurocognitive changes; some researchers have demonstrated that these alterations
could occur over the span of one season. Youth football players represent 70% of all athletes participating in the
sport and experience over half of their head impacts during practice - an environment amendable to intervention.
A current study (1K25HD101686-01A1) will develop an evidence-based intervention aimed to reduce head
impact exposure in practices, using a community-engaged approach. This proposal enhances this parent study
by incorporating clinical outcome assessments and engaging football athletes in the evaluation of the intervention
program. The objective of this implementation-effectiveness study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the
intervention program on reducing exposure in practices and its effect on mitigating changes in clinical
outcomes, while monitoring the implementation process. In Aim 1, measures of neurocognition, postural
control, and vestibular/ocular motor symptoms will be evaluated from athletes participating on control and
intervention youth football teams as well as non-contact sports teams at pre- and post-season time points.
Biomechanical data informing the frequency and severity of hits during the season will be measured using a
custom instrumented mouthpiece. The effectiveness of the intervention at reducing head impact exposure and
mitigating changes in clinical outcomes will be evaluated. In Aim 2, the feasibility and potential utility of the
implementation strategy of the intervention program will be assessed to inform intervention program outcomes.
Former youth football players participating at the high school and collegiate level will be engaged to evaluate the
feasibility and acceptability of the intervention program. The results of this study will provide important pilot data
on the effect of reducing exposure on clinical outcomes, while informing how the intervention program works and
providing valuable insight into future large-scale testing of the intervention. The predoctoral Candidate will
achieve the study aims through cross-disciplinary mentorship in injury biomechanics, public health,
implementation science, neuropsychology, and sports medicine. This fellowship opportunity will also provide
robust didactic training and experiential learning in traumatic brain injury, methods of biomechanical data
collection and implementation science, biostatistics, clinical trials design, neurocognitive test administration and
interpretation, and professional development. The research and training plan of this Predoctoral Fellowship will
position the Candidate for success as a productive independent research scientist with a skillset to combine
injury biomechanics and public health to assess injury prevention strategies."
10827866,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Effective gait rehabilitation must be engaging, intense, repetitive, and focused on
purposeful movement. However, patients after stroke can have neuromuscular or cognitive impairments that
make this ideal unattainable without physical assistance. Paradoxically, this assistance can hinder motor
recovery when patients habituate and reduce their sensorimotor engagement (the active correction of motor
errors). To counter habituation and improve learning during assisted gait training, this project newly combines
two theoretical frameworks: one from social psychology governing how social pressure impacts motivation, and
another from neuroscience describing motor learning as processes of error-driven adaptation and reinforcement
learning. Positive social pressure from working in a team can boost motivation compared to working individually,
which may improve rehabilitation by enhancing active error correction and increasing the value of successful
actions. This motivation enhancement in a team setting is termed the Köhler effect and is moderated by two
mechanisms: upward social comparison (comparing self-performance to others) and indispensability (when
success requires effort from all team members). Although these mechanisms have robust positive effects in
exercise and cognitive tasks, their role in motor learning is unknown. Addressing this gap could improve
rehabilitation care for millions who annually acquire and live with impairments from neurological injury. This
fellowship’s complementary specific aims target the impact of each Köhler mechanism on locomotor
rehabilitation. Aim 1 investigates how promoting upward social comparison affects sensorimotor engagement
and motor learning during assisted locomotion and Aim 2 investigates the effects of indispensability. To enhance
scientific rigor, a new model system is used: healthy participants walk on a treadmill and receive a standardized,
temporary neuromotor impairment by electrically activating their right hamstrings during leg swing. This
perturbation decreases participants’ net mechanical work during swing and shortens step length. The goal is to
reach a target mechanical work while viewing step-by-step work feedback. Unlike a kinematic target, which a
therapist can correct, the work goal can only be achieved if the participant contributes a significant amount of
effort to the rehabilitation task. Showing the separated participant and therapist work contributions is expected
to evoke upward social comparison. In Aim 2, therapist assistance is provided through a telerobotic system to
rebalance effort contributions, making the therapist “weaker” and participants indispensable. This project is
accompanied by a robust fellowship plan of interdisciplinary training that bridges neuroscience, rehabilitation,
social psychology, engineering, and post-acute stroke care. The major theoretical advancement will be a new
understanding of how sensorimotor engagement and motor learning are influenced by positive social pressure.
The results will serve to increase the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions by shifting patient perceptions,
so they view themselves not as lesser contributors to a shared rehabilitation goal but as indispensable to success."

Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect approximately 50 million [1] people worldwide, with
African Americans facing an increased risk of developing this life-limiting disease characterized by the eventual
loss of cognitive ability and independence. ADRD has an unpredictable trajectory, making end-of-life planning
in conjunction with primary family caregivers imperative, including considering the use of hospice services.
Despite the benefits of hospice, African Americans underutilize the services, often opting to undergo
aggressive and costly end-of-life treatment. African Americans are also at increased risk of dying in the
hospital. Barriers to hospice use in African Americans include medical mistrust, lack of knowledge, and lack of
congruence between the patient’s values and the hospice philosophy. However, in-depth exploration of the
sources of and perceptions about hospice information, especially among persons with ADRD, has garnered
little attention. Understanding the sources from which older African Americans living with ADRD and their
primary family caregivers, who often serve as decisional support persons, receive hospice information and how
hospice exposure influences decision-making may better inform hospice decision-making conversations. In this
exploratory, qualitative study, we will conduct in-depth semi-structured interviews with approximately 30 former
family caregivers of older African Americans who lived with ADRD to (1) identify the sources and
characteristics of hospice information exposure and (2) explore the perceived credibility and effectiveness of
hospice information and the influence of the information on the hospice decision-making process. Former
family caregivers have a wealth of experience and can provide a unique perspective on the hospice decision-
making process. Findings will inform the development of culturally appropriate instruments to identify hospice
information sources, decision-making, and future interventions to improve hospice utilization and reduce end-
of-life disparities in older African Americans living with ADRD. The proposed research and training plan aligns
with the National Institute of Nursing Research Strategic Plan on health equity and social determinants of
health. The proposed study builds on the applicant’s knowledge of health inequity and disparities, hospice
underutilization in African Americans living with ADRD, and qualitative methods. Training will focus on
acquiring the skills needed to conduct independent research on hospice exposure and its contribution to
hospice decision-making in older African Americans with ADRD and their primary family caregivers, qualitative
and community-based research, and advancing the scientific understanding of end-of-life care disparity and
hospice utilization in this population. The training plan, fellowship co-sponsors, and research team experts will
prepare the applicant for a career as an independent researcher conducting rigorous qualitative research on
health inequity and end-of-life disparities in African Americans."

The serotonergic (5HTergic) system is implicated in a wide range of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric
phenomena, including the regulation of mood and stress reactivity. While 5HT actions have been assumed to
be mediated exclusively through 5HT receptors and their synaptic effects, recent studies have demonstrated the
presence of nuclear pools of 5HT in dorsal raphe serotonergic neurons and forebrain target neurons. Our
laboratory has established that 5HT forms covalent bonds with histone H3—resulting in H3 glutamine 5 serotonin
(H3Q5ser)–a process known as H3 serotonylation. We have further shown that H3 serotonylation plays key
regulatory roles in establishing normal embryonic and adult patterns of brain transcriptional plasticity. However,
functional roles for H3 serotonylation during early post-natal brain development, time points encompassing
critical periods of neural plasticity, have largely been unexplored, and the impact of environmental stimuli
(aberrant or otherwise) on this modification during early life remains unknown. I hypothesize that H3
serotonylation trajectories vary – in a region-specific manner – across the post-natal brain to control critical
aspects of neurodevelopmental gene expression and early life stress disrupts these patterns directly influencing
vulnerability to stress-related behavioral abnormalities. Under the mentorship of Drs. Ian Maze and Eric Nestler
at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, I will address this hypothesis with three distinct aims using a
variety of approaches. In Aim 1, I will functionally assess H3 serotonylation dynamics during post-natal
development, examine how early life stress disrupts these patterns, and elucidate the causal relationship of this
novel histone modification on gene expression regulation using strategic integration of epigenomic and
transcriptomic approaches (ie. RNA sequencing and CUT&RUN). In Aim 2, I will characterize how disruptions in
post-natal serotonylation-associated gene expression directly result in alterations in brain circuitry leading to
increased vulnerability to stress-related behavioral abnormalities using advanced gene-editing techniques and
behavioral analyses. In Aim 3, I will characterize brain-wide patterns of H3 serotonylation across post-natal brain
development and in response to early like stress using whole brain clearing and imaging techniques (ie.
iDISCO+). Overall, this project will provide novel insight into the ways that h3 serotonylation controls brain
development and the mechanisms by which disruptions to this posttranslational mark cause aberrant
pathophysiological states."

 Bacteroides vulgatus (Bvu) is one of the most common members of the gut microbiota across diverse human
populations and has been strongly associated with multiple human diseases including the inflammatory bowel
diseases (IBD). However, there exist fundamental gaps in our understanding of the genetic and phenotypic
diversity within the Bvu species complex, as well as how Bvu strains mechanistically contribute to host
inflammatory phenotypes. Our long-term goal is to understand how gut microbes impact human health and
disease. Our preliminary studies in the human-derived Bvu strain CL09T03C04 identified putative genetic
determinants for Bvu fitness and competition in the mouse gut and also associated these genes with metabolites
identified by mass spectrometry. Using gnotobiotic mice, we have also established that different Bvu strains have
variable impacts on intestinal inflammation and immunity. These results and other diverse associations between
Bvu and gut inflammation in humans and animal models could be explained in part by genetic diversity among
Bvu strains. Yet, there remains a paucity of well-annotated genetic information associated with this species, and
strain-level variation across the Bvu species complex is almost completely unexplored. The objective of the
proposed research is to define the relationships between Bvu genetic variation with host inflammation and gut
microbial ecology. We will test the central hypothesis that Bvu uses distinct genetic and metabolic traits to
colonize the gut and modify host inflammation, and that the variable presence of those traits in Bvu strains
explains their divergent host responses. In Specific Aim 1, we will test the working hypothesis that regulation of
distinct lipid metabolites is required for in vivo survival and competition in Bvu strain CL09T03C04. In Specific
Aim 2, we will test the working hypotheses that the ability of different Bvu strains to promote or restrict gut
inflammation is mediated by distinct genetic traits, and that gut inflammation alters Bvu fitness. The expected
outcomes will vertically advance the field in several ways. First, they will provide the first in-depth understanding
of genetic and phenotypic diversity in the Bvu species complex, including identification of genes, pathways, and
metabolites responsible for Bvu’s ability to colonize the gut and to impact and adapt to gut inflammation. Second,
they will identify pro- and anti-inflammatory Bvu strains and affiliated mechanisms that may explain prior
association of the Bvu species complex with both exacerbation of and protection against IBD-associated
inflammation. These results are expected to have a positive impact because they could lead to the development
of new Bvu-directed prognostic markers and therapeutic approaches to modify gut microbial ecology and
inflammation, potentially improving diagnostic and therapeutic management of IBD and other human diseases."

Medulloblastoma (MB) is a tumor of the hindbrain that occurs in children with a peak incidence between the ages
of 3 and 7. Based on extensive molecular evidence, medulloblastoma is classified into four major groups, among
which Group (G3) MB with MYC overexpression, carry the worse prognosis. Thus, novel therapies are needed
to effectively treat these aggressive brain tumors in children. Recent genome wide sequencing and 850K
methylation profiling showed that G3MB has a paucity of mutations, most of which occur in epigenetic regulatory
enzymes that modify histones. However, a significant proportion of MYC-driven G3 MBs do not harbor any
mutations suggesting that additional non-mutated epigenetic regulators, so called “hidden drivers”, might act as
oncogenes or tumor-suppressors, implicated in shaping the chromatin structure and driving G3 MB genesis. We
performed a dropout shRNA screen of 243 unique mouse epigenetic regulators, and the top hit was SMYD3, a
H4K5me1 methyltransferase that importantly regulates MYC expression. Systems biology reveals that SMYD3
is most overexpressed in G3 MBs that specifically overexpress MYC (type II) compared to the other G3 MB
subtypes and MB Groups. To address the role of SMYD3 in driving G3 MB, we will use multiple complementary
approaches in vitro and in vivo in both mouse and human G3MB to 1) assess how SMYD3 overexpression
contributes to G3MB tumorigenesis, 2) use mass spectrometry to identify interacting proteins and define the role
of SMYD3 in shaping the transcriptome, proteome and phosphoproteome, and 3) evaluate whether SMYD3 and
other epigenetic regulators could be considered as therapeutic targets for future clinical trials in MYC-driven
G3MB. Our ultimate goal is to identify epigenetic vulnerabilities that can be therapeutically targeted to treat the
most aggressive forms of the disease."

Hearing loss is one of the most common conditions among adults in the US. Currently, more than 30 million American
adults experience some form of hearing loss and this number is expected to increase to 59.4 million people in the US by
2060. As this number increases, research focusing on health outcomes for individuals with hearing loss will become in-
creasingly important. Existing research shows that those with hearing loss have poorer health outcomes compared to their
hearing peers. The current literature shows that adults in the US with hearing loss were more likely to be in fair or poor
health, have significantly more days of poor physical and mental health in the past month, and report serious psychologi-
cal distress compared to those with little to no trouble hearing. American adults with hearing loss also had significantly
lower health literacy than their hearing peers, which may affect health outcomes due to a lack of accessible health infor-
mation and poor communication with health providers. Many adults first experience hearing loss in older ages as more
health conditions begin to arise during this stage of life. In fact, approximately one in three people between the ages of 65
and 74 have hearing loss and nearly half of those older than 75 have difficulty hearing. Therefore, as hearing loss becomes
a more common occurrence among aging adults, more research is needed to identify health disparities experienced by this
population and understand factors that lead to such disparities, such as health literacy. Using nationally representative data
from a US sample of older adults, the proposed F31 project will address this need with the following research aims: 1)
Describe inequities in self-rated and physically assessed hearing loss by key sociodemographic factors; 2) Investigate risk
differences in the relationship between hearing loss and cardiovascular outcomes by intersectional subgroups of sex/gen-
der and race/ethnicity; and 3) Examine the mediating effect of health literacy in the relationship between hearing loss and
cardiovascular outcomes. This research will consist of secondary data analysis using survey, physical measure, and bi-
omarker data from the US Health and Retirement Study, a population-based longitudinal panel study that interviews and
surveys adults aged 51 and older. The proposed training plan and mentoring team in this NIH Ruth L. Kirschstein Na-
tional Research Service Award will support the successful completion of this project and will provide valuable knowledge
and skills needed to establish a career as an independent researcher in the areas of aging and hearing loss. As hearing loss
becomes a more common occurrence among aging individuals, research such as the proposed project will be foundational
in establishing the causal pathways that lead to poorer cardiovascular outcomes and higher mortality among older adults
with hearing loss, which will be key in helping to prevent, detect, diagnose, and treat diseases among adults with disabili-
ties."

Telomere maintenance at chromosome ends is essential for the growth of cancer cells. In humans, telomeres
end in a single strand overhang consisting of GGTTAG repeats that form the substrate for telomerase.
Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase composed of two subunits: a protein component (TERT) and an RNA
component (TR) which contains an integral template used to reverse transcribe multiple telomeric repeats
during a single telomere binding event. Telomerase is an attractive target for cancer therapies because it is
expressed in over 85% of cancer cells, while most adult somatic cells lack telomerase. Thiopurines are a class
of nucleoside analogs used to treat leukemia and some pediatric cancers but are highly toxic. The prodrug 6-
thio-2'-deoxyguanosine (6-thio-dG) was developed to reduce non-specific thiopurine toxicity. This drug was
shown to successfully reduce the growth of mouse tumor xenografts for multiple cancer types. 6-thio-dG
treatment can also cause telomere shortening and dysfunction, however, the mechanism was unknown until
recently. In biochemistry experiments, I discovered that human telomerase can readily add the 6-thio-dG
metabolite, 6-thio-dGTP, to a growing telomere chain, but this insertion then strongly inhibits telomerase’s
ability to add additional telomeric repeats. I found that POT1-TPP1, which normally enhances telomerase
binding and the addition of multiple repeats, cannot restore telomere elongation in the presence of 6-thio-
dGTP. In addition, 6-thio-dGTP has a low micromolar IC50 for human telomerase due to telomerase’s inability
to discriminate between dGTP and 6-thio-dGTP but does not inhibit DNA polymerase progression, reducing its
off-target impact. My preliminary data for this project demonstrate that 6-thio-dG can disrupt telomerase
binding when the modified base is located at the 3’ end of the telomeric overhang. I hypothesize that 6-thio-dG
addition impairs telomerase’s interaction with the telomere, thereby disrupting cycling for repeat addition
synthesis and inhibiting telomerase elongation of telomeres in cells. I will use complementary biochemical,
single-molecule, and cellular approaches to test my hypothesis. Aim 1 will elucidate the mechanism by which
6-thio-dG disrupts the telomerase catalytic cycle. Aim 2 will determine whether telomerase can synthesize
DNA and extend telomeres in cancer cells treated with 6-thio-dG. Aim 3 will determine if 6-thio-dG efficacy in
cancer cells is enhanced by inhibiting the thiopurine sanitase, NUDT15.
Completing this project will improve our understanding of how 6-thio-dG impacts telomerase activity and
telomere maintenance in cancer cells. It will also enhance our understanding of how 6-thio-dGTP nucleotide
impacts telomerase catalysis and its potential utility as a therapeutic for halting cancer cell proliferation. This
fellowship will allow me to acquire new skills related to the project’s aims and outlines specific mentors for
each. Career development is also a strong focus in this fellowship, which includes plans to attend workshops
related to experimental techniques, data analysis, and scientific writing and attend national and international
conferences to present the findings of this research project. This fellowship will help me acquire the training
necessary to become an independent investigator."
10907550,"Project Summary
 In each cell cycle, DNA replication machinery encounters replication fork barriers including DNA lesions,
secondary structure-forming repetitive sequences, and transcriptional machinery. Oncogenic transformation also
perturbs normal replication and results in replication fork dysfunction commonly referred to as replication stress.
Response to replication stress is an essential aspect of the DNA damage response in cells, and the
consequences of inappropriate response results in genome instability and cancer.
 We have recently identified a novel regulatory pathway that is required for the protection of stalled
replication forks and recovery from replication stress. We showed that the mammalian replisome contains a
previously unidentified and completely unstudied protein, RTF2 (Replication Termination Factor 2), which must
be removed for proper response to replication stress. We showed that RTF2 is removed from stalled forks in a
process that is dependent on the proteasomal shuttle proteins DDI1 and DDI2, which interact with RTF2 and the
proteasome. Persistence of RTF2 at stalled forks resulted in replication fork restart defects, hyperactivation of
the DNA damage signaling, accumulation of single stranded DNA, sensitivity to replication drugs including
hydroxyurea and aphidicolin, and chromosome instability. Our results establish that removal of RTF2 is
necessary for cells to manage replication stress and maintain genome integrity.
 The first goal of the proposed studies is to fully understand how RTF2 functions during DNA replication.
To this end, we will fully characterize replication without RTF2, using a conditional knockout mouse and cell
model, and identify the mechanism of how RTF2 regulates DNA replication during unperturbed conditions. The
second goal is to determine how RTF2 is itself regulated under replication stress and why it needs to be removed
from the replisome. RTF2 ubiquitination is necessary for interaction with DDI1/2, thus we will identify the
regulatory network of this ubiquitination and subsequent removal of RTF2 from the replication fork. The final goal
in this project, is to leverage the idea that the removal of proteins during DNA damage response is as equally
important as recruitment of DNA repair proteins to sites of DNA damage. Most published studies have
concentrated on proteins traveling or recruited to sites of DNA damage. However, our work on DDIs and RTF2
suggests a large component of the DNA damage response network is missing, i.e. proteins that must be removed
from the sites of damage to allow for proper DNA damage response and repair. In order to identify other proteins
removed during replication stress, we will use an approach similar to the one we used for our DDI studies and
detect proteins inappropriately enriched at stressed replication forks using a recently-developed technique,
Isolation of Proteins On Nascent DNA (iPOND). We envision that our studies will identify yet unknown regulatory
networks essential during the DNA damage response that prevents development of cancer-causing genome
instability."

Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). To achieve this goal, I will build upon my clinical expertise and
current research training. For the K01 period, I have set four short term training goals/objectives: (1) Develop
competence in post-acute care policy impacting people with ADRD, (2) Develop skills in management and
manipulation of Medicare data of people with ADRD, (3) Develop competence in propensity score methods
and data analysis for data of people with ADRD, and (4) Enhance my grantsmanship, ethical conduct of
research, and mentorship skills for career development and advancement.
Mentoring Team: My Primary Mentor is Kit Simpson, DrPH and my Co-Mentor is Kenneth Ottenbacher, PhD,
OTR. Additional members of the mentoring team include Annie Simpson PhD, Jacobo Mintzer, MD, MBA, and
Kathryn H Bowles PhD, RN, FAAN, FACMI. My mentoring team is highly qualified and includes nationally and
internationally recognized experts in health services research (K. Simpson), post-acute care quality measures
(K. Ottenbacher), ADRD (J. Mintzer), study design and analysis methods for observational studies (A.

development activities and participate in the K01 research.
Research Strategy: Medicare home health underwent unprecedented changes in 2020 due to the COVID-19
pandemic and a new payment model. These vast changes threaten to exacerbate existing barriers to home
health access for people with ADRD. Decreased access to home health causes harm to people with ADRD
and can trigger a cascade of resource and financial implications for the health care system. Impacts of the
current crisis on home health access and quality for people with ADRD has not been examined but is urgently
needed. This K01 project will use well matched groups, to show the impact of reimbursement change and
pandemic disruption on home health access and outcomes for people with and without ADRD through analysis
of Medicare assessment and billing data. Propensity score methods will be used to balance patient risk factors
for comparison groups. Aim 1: Describe differences in home health access and outcomes between well-
matched groups of Medicare Beneficiaries (MBs) with and without ADRD in 2019. Aim 2: Examine changes in
home health access and outcomes for well-matched groups of MBs in 2019 vs 2020. Aim 3: Examine changes
in home health access and outcomes for well-matched groups of MBs in 2019 vs 2021. Findings from this
study can help to optimize access, cost, and outcomes for people with ADRD and the Medicare system and
inform advocacy efforts, current home health practice, and future post-acute care policies."

10918091,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Individual cells within a given cancer type are capable of expressing a diversity of phenotypic states resulting
from an underlying heterogeneity of genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, and molecular features. How this
diversity evolves and influences therapeutic response is an essential question in cancer biology. One emerging
mechanism of developing such heterogeneity is the evolution of microenvironmental niches within tumors that
support a cancer stem cell (CSC) state. CSCs are defined by their functional capabilities such as long-term self-
renewal, the capacity to give rise to a range of differentiated cell types, and enhanced tumor-forming ability.
They are also believed to drive resistance to anti-tumor therapies, such as radiation therapy. Pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a dismal prognosis, with a 5-year overall survival of <10% and a dire need for novel
therapeutic strategies. Radiation is an integral part of PDAC therapy, however not all cancer cells respond.
Identifying mechanisms of radioresistance would transform the clinical management of PDAC. Using pancreatic
tumor models, our preliminary results suggest that secreted Wnt ligands produced by one cancer cell subset
drive a Lgr5+ stem-like state in another cancer cell subset, in essence forming a supportive niche that promotes
stemness within pancreatic tumors. In this proposal, I will test the central hypothesis that Wnt-driven cellular
phenotypic heterogeneity and stemness promote radiotherapy resistance in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. I will
examine the role of pancreatic tumor cell subpopulations in radiation resistance, including the Lgr5+ cells (Aim
1) and the Wnt producing niche (Aim 2). Under Aim 1, I will characterize the cancer stem cell properties of
Lgr5+ cells in pancreatic cancer, their relative resistance to radiation therapy, and their role in tumor
repopulation. These results will determine whether Lgr5+ cells are CSCs and drivers of radioresistance in
established tumors and inform their molecular characteristics, which may provide added means to target these
cells. Under Aim 2, I will investigate the targeting of the Wnt-producing niche in combination with radiation.
Specifically, I will use genetic or pharmacologic perturbation of the Wnt pathway in combination with radiation
and assay tumor response and animal survival. These efforts will test the therapeutic potential of Wnt inhibitors
as radiosensitizers in PDAC. Collectively, this work will facilitate basic mechanistic insights into both cellular
heterogeneity and radioresistance, with the ultimate goal of translating these discoveries and developing
improved treatment strategies for PDAC patients."

Cervical cancer (CC) is almost entirely preventable with current technologies, yet, it remains the most common
cancer and the most common cause of cancer death among women in Eastern Africa. Globally, CC is the 4th
most common cause of cancer incidence and mortality among women, and the leading cause of cancer in 42
low- and middle- income countries (LMICs), where 90% of CC deaths occur. To achieve the 2018 World Health
Organization (WHO)'s call to action towards global CC elimination, there is an urgent need to adapt, implement,
and scale-up effective technologies in LMICs. The mainstay of CC prevention in LMICs has been the single-visit
approach using screen-and-treat (SVA-SAT) method, using visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and ablative
treatment with cryotherapy to manage precancerous lesions. It is a low-cost screening approach and it minimizes
loss to follow-up compared to the traditional cytology. Despite well-established effectiveness of VIA on popula-
tion-level reduction in CC burden, the estimated screening uptake among women aged 30-49 in Kenya is 16%,
far from the WHO's target of 70% twice-lifetime screening of women ages 35-45 by 2030. Additionally, there is
extremely low fidelity of SVA-SAT; up to 70% of screen-positive women do not receive treatment. The low treat-
ment rate has been attributed to programmatic and logistical challenges of implementing cryotherapy in low-
resource settings (e.g., supply chain difficulties of refrigerant gas, equipment failure, and treatment duration >10
min). Thermal ablation (TA), was recommended by the WHO in 2019 and is an effective and safe alternative to
cryotherapy. The portable device can be charged with electricity, batteries or solar panels, which is ideal for rural
settings. However, wide dissemination and adoption have been challenged by undefined drivers of successful
implementation. Our objective is to develop and evaluate a locally contextualized dissemination and implemen-
tation (D&I) strategy for SVA-SAT with TA (SVA-SAT+TA) to inform national scale-up. Our hypothesis is that
TA will enhance the feasibility, adoption, and sustainability of CC prevention services via SVA-SAT, compared
to cryotherapy. Our multidisciplinary team proposes five-year prospective, stepped-wedge, randomized trial to
implement SVA-SAT+TA in ten reproductive health (RH) clinics in central Kenya. In Aim 1, we will collaborate
with multi-level (clinic, county, national) stakeholders to develop a sustainable D&I strategy to introduce SVA-
SAT+TA that effectively accounts for the heterogeneity of the client, provider and system inputs. In Aim 2, we
will deliver and rigorously evaluate the SVA-SAT+TA intervention at scale in public RH clinics in Kenya, using
the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) framework. In Aim 3, we
will compare the cost, cost-effectiveness and budget impact of SVA-SAT+TA to SVA-SAT using cryotherapy.
Together, the results from this project will improve wider implementation and scale-up of an evidence-based
intervention, SVA-SAT+TA, and provide the necessary evidence to guide policy and serve as a model for CC
prevention in the LMICs context."

Metastatic breast cancer (BrCa) is the 2nd most prevalent cause of cancer mortality in women in the United
States, with a 5-year overall survival of only 22%. Though cancer immunotherapies are capable of generating
durable responses across a variety of cancer types, immunologic rejection of BrCa is rare and spontaneous
regression unusual. Thus, there exists a strong precedent for allied combinatorial therapy paradigms that
potentiate immunotherapy (ITx) by boosting tumor immunogenicity and/or curbing immunosuppressive
mechanisms. In this proposal, we will systematically assess the capacity of focused ultrasound (FUS) - a
technique for non-invasive, non-ionizing acoustic energy deposition into tumors – to potentiate adaptive immunity
against BrCa metastases and synergize with selected immunotherapies. UVA is a world leader in FUS ITx
research, with two “first-in-human” clinical trials underway to evaluate combinations of FUS with PD1 blockade
in solid tumors (including metastatic BrCa) and a third trial pending approval to evaluate FUS and gemcitabine
for immune-mediated control of BrCa tumors. These trials are accompanied by a companion imaging trial
designed to evaluate CD8+ T cell infiltration in patients’ tumor deposits via PET/CT, an approach that will also
be integrated into our pre-clinical studies. To this end, this proposal leverages these clinical trials as well as a
robust pre-clinical program to fortify a highly translational research pipeline rooted in the domains of immunology,
molecular imaging, liquid biopsy and radiogenomics. With this toolkit, we intend to design and implement
FUS+ITx combinations that offer the potential for quantum improvements in metastatic BrCa therapy. This is
achieved in three Specific Aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will expand on intriguing early clinical and pre-clinical
findings to identify FUS regimens that, when combined with myeloid-targeted therapies, augment the efficacy of
chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy against primary and disseminated BrCa tumors (e.g. brain
metastases). In Specific Aim 2, we will engineer FUS-based theranostic technologies for liquid biopsy in BrCa in
order to (i) discover novel biomarkers of response to FUS and ITx (ii) enable liquid biopsy in settings with low
basal levels of circulating tumor biomarkers. Finally, in Specific Aim 3, we will construct machine learning
frameworks that integrate radiological data with genomic data from liquid biopsy specimens (e.g. radiogenomics)
to advance BrCa precision care with FUS and ITx. The highly innovate aims of this proposal lend to a systematic
approach for advancing the role of FUS in CAR T cell therapy, cancer biomarker discovery and personalized
ITx, thereby promising to improve the lives of metastatic breast cancer patients."
10897069,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Clinical and preclinical studies indicate that autoimmunity and chronic inflammation, resulting from abnormalities
in regulatory T cells (Tregs), contribute to the development and progression of pulmonary arterial hypertension
(PAH). Treg dysfunction affects males and females differently and may arise because of pathogenic gene
variants and an inflamed tissue microenvironment. Treg infusion, as a cell-based therapy, restores immune
regulation, reduces vascular inflammation, and prevents animals from developing PAH. In a novel transgenic rat
model of hereditary PAH, monoallelic mutations in bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2 (Bmpr2) and lung
inflammation elicit severe disease. In these Bmpr2 mutant animals, as well as the athymic rat model of disease,
the predisposition to PAH may relate to abnormal Treg development and function. Infusion of genetically-
corrected (Bmpr2 wildtype) Tregs into Bmpr2 mutant animals, or injection of Tregs into athymic rats, restores
immune regulation, prevents vascular remodeling and ameliorates PAH. A number of Treg-infusion clinical trials
are being tested for autoimmune and inflammatory conditions and have shown early promise. Given the future
potential of Treg therapy in treating human PAH, this proposal tests the hypothesis that genetic and
environmental cues trigger Treg abnormalities that exacerbate PAH and that restoration of Treg function may be
sufficient to reverse severe disease.
This proposal investigates how genetic (BMPR2 mutations) and environmental (pulmonary inflammation) risk
factors contribute to Treg derangements and a predisposition to PAH, and how Treg infusion can limit vascular
injury and reverse PAH. Proposed studies address a previously undocumented role of BMPR2 signaling in
adaptive immune cells (i.e., Tregs). Specific Aim 1 evaluates the mechanisms by which Treg immunity in PAH
is affected by Bmpr2 mutations, chronic lung inflammation and sex-related factors. Specific Aim 1 has two
subaims which study thymic Treg development (Aim 1a) and pulmonary Treg phenotype and function (Aim 1b)
in PAH. By understanding how Treg infusion quells lung inflammation and prevents vascular injury, Specific
Aim 2 develops protocols to use ex vivo-expanded Tregs to treat established PAH. Specific Aim 2 has three
subaims which first proposes to label and track infused Tregs after adoptive transfer (Aim 2a), then to assess
Treg protective effects on pulmonary arterial vascular cells (Aim 2b), and, finally, to test the efficacy of various
Treg infusion strategies in reversing advanced PAH (Aim 2c).These studies help unify the concepts of genetic
vulnerability and immune dysregulation as related risk factors predisposing to PAH, which may offer clear
directions for future therapeutic avenues, most especially Treg immunotherapy."

 This research, in response to the PAR-19-253, “Focused Technology Research andDevelopment,”
aims to pioneer new advances in biological optical microscopy. Methods such as the development of
fluorescent proteins, single molecule fluorescence detection, single molecule fluorescence resonance
energy transfer (smFRET) and super-resolution microscopy enabled molecular level study of in vitro and
live cells of increasing complexity. The single molecule methods allowed researchers to observe kinetic
pathways and transient states unobservable with bulk methods. Despite recent advances, the existing
optical probes have limitations. Fluorescent proteins are comparable in size to the proteins they label and
photobleach quickly. In situ labeling of cytosol proteins is possible, but in vitro labeling methods are much
preferred and there are no reliable methods to introduce these proteins into cytosol of cells.
 This research will address these grand challenges by fundamentally expanding the toolbox of
optical microscopy. Aim 1 will develop new methods to introduce proteins labeled in vitro with organic
dyes directly into the cytosol of cells and the insertion of dye-labeled membrane proteins into cell
membranes, thereby expanding the application of optical probes to new biological systems. These
methods will be used to insert up-converting nanoparticle (UCNP) probes into live cells to allow the long-
term tracking of specific individual proteins from minutes to months with nanometer spatial resolution.
This technology will also allow the controllable transfection of cells with multiple genes. Aim 2 will
fundamentally improve the temporal resolution of smFRET to ≤ 100𝜇𝑠 and develop smFRET methods
that can span across cell membranes. Aim 3 will extend biological optical microscopy to access the
temporal and spatial scales of molecular motion. Here, UCNPs will be used to measure the continuous
transport of cargos by dynein in DRG neurons capable of resolving single molecular steps with one
millisecond time resolution over a distance of 900 𝜇𝑚. Using plasmonic optical probes, this work aims to
achieve ~ 100 𝑛𝑠 time resolution and < 1 𝑛𝑚 spatial resolution in live cells.
 By the end of the 4-year funding period, a device will be demonstrated that is able to introduce
controllable numbers of nanoparticles, proteins, and multiple genes and promoters into 1000s of cells with
high survival rates. The cells will be transferred onto microscope coverslips or microfluidic cells suitable
for high-resolution optical microscopy. An instrument capable of 100𝜇𝑠 smFRET will have been used to
study the dynamics of G-protein couped receptors (GPCRs). Another instrument will be built to improve
the time resolution of sub-nanometer movement to by up to ~ 100 𝑛𝑠. With this instrument, the real-time
visualization of the motion of molecular systems may be possible."

This proposal is built upon a novel discovery from the PI Mak laboratory showing that a ‘non-electrostatic,
specific, manipulatable, sugar-sugar’ is an attachment factor for HIV. This interaction occurs between HIV
oligomannose (oligoman) and cellular N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) prior to receptor engagement. The
conservation of glycan biology across domains of life and the non-living (viruses) has led to our current proposal
to investigate whether this oligoman-GlcNAc (or oligoman-based) interaction may underpin some of the dynamic-
interplays amongst: (i) vaginal microbes; (ii) HIV; and (iii) their human host. Our findings that HIV double up to
use its oligoman enriched HIV envelope (Env) glycan shield as an attachment factor may offer a general principle
to account, at least in part, for: (i) how vaginal lactobacillus offers protection from HIV transmission; and (ii) how
vaginal Neisseria gonorrhoeae increases the risk of HIV transmission. As many vaginal microbes have mannose-
binding proteins and GlcNAc on their bacterial surface, our hypothesis is that the enrichment of oligoman N-
glycans on HIV Env acts as a molecular Velcro to interact with mannose-binding proteins and/or GlcNAc sugars
on the surface of genital microbes. We further hypothesize that the biology of these genital microbes would
either helps trap HIV to deny their access to infect the host or acts as a courier service to deliver HIV into the
host. We will use a combination of ultrastructural imaging techniques, biophysical approaches, molecular virology
techniques, cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) -imaging, glycan matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization -
mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), and tissue culture-based epithelial cell model system to examine the
transmission of HIV via oligoman-based binding via two specific aims. In Aim1, we will define whether vaginal
lactobacillus limits HIV transmission via oligoman-based trapping. In Aim2, we will assess if HIV hitch-hike across
sub-epithelial barrier via oligoman-mediated bindings with N.gonorrhoeae. Successful completion of this
proposal may result in proof of concept data that a simple oligoman-based mechanism could account for the
opposing abilities of how lactobacillus protect and how N.gonorrhoeae enhance HIV transmission, respectively.
We will also use pre-set vaginal microbes reference population from ATCC to evaluate these glycan-based
interaction at the population level. We will perform follow-up analyses with vaginal microbiomes derived from
established and clinically relevant South African HIV cohort. Data showing oligoman-based interaction is a
contributing factor to sexual transmission of HIV may offer new hope for the development of a practical, orally
delivery self-administrated HIV mitigation strategy using optimised versions of GlcNAc or mannose, given these
parental monosaccharides are widely available, non-toxic, off-the counter, nutraceuticals."

An estimated 40.3 million adults and adolescents needed treatment for substance use disorders in 2020. Yet
only 6.5% of those needing treatment received it. Access to high-quality care remains a significant challenge.
In the past decade, private equity (PE) firms have acquired numerous substance use disorder (SUD) treatment
facilities, although evidence on the extent of these acquisitions is scarce. SUD treatment centers are attractive
targets for private equity acquisition due to increased need for SUD treatment, increased health insurance
coverage, and expansions in coverage of SUD treatments, all of which increase demand for treatment.
Opportunities for efficiencies due to the fragmented nature of the market and changes to regulations regarding
buprenorphine prescribing have the potential to increase profits. Commentators have raised concerns that a
focus on short term profits may lead to quality declines in private equity-acquired facilities. Similar acquisitions
in other areas of health care have resulted in declines in quality and increases in mortality. In this proposal, we
will, for the first time, comprehensively catalog and describe SUD facility acquisitions by private equity
investors from 2010-2022. We will we use a quasi-experimental difference in differences research design that
leverages differences in the timing of ownership changes to study changes in the delivery of care and patient
outcomes. Our interdisciplinary team consisting of faculty from the Yale Schools of Medicine, Management,
and Public Health is uniquely suited to study this issue with the methodological and substantive expertise to
assess the complex treatment and policy implications. Our specific aims are: (1) To catalog and describe
changes in private equity ownership of SUD treatment facilities (2010-2022) and the predictors of such
changes; (2) To determine whether private equity acquisition is associated with changes at the organization
level including changes in treatments offered (more facilities offering medication for opioid use disorder
(MOUD) treatment; fewer facilities offering primary care services or services attractive to complex patients) and
changes in the types of insurance accepted; (3) To determine whether private equity acquisition is associated
with changes in MOUD use, quality and patient insurance type in acquired facilities. Pressure to increase the
volume of commercially insured patients given the significantly higher reimbursement rates may lead to
reductions in the number of Medicaid patients treated; (4) To determine whether private equity acquisition is
associated with changes in OUD treatment quality and opioid-related adverse events in communities with
acquisitions. Ultimately, a goal of an SUD treatment facility is to improve health outcomes. Using commercial
insurance data, we will examine changes in treatment quality and health outcomes (OUD-related emergency
department visits). To our knowledge no information about the extent and impacts of this change have been
documented in the peer-reviewed literature."
10784759,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Existing approaches targeting selected pro- or anti-inflammatory mediators during experimental sepsis
mostly ended in failure, due to the un-resolved predicament of sepsis patients experiencing the dichotomy of
severe immune-suppression as well as exacerbated pathogenic inflammation, collectively contributing to
increased multi-organ injuries and compromised immune defense toward secondary infections. Our integrated
experimental and computational studies combined with scRNAseq analyses expanded our understanding of the
traditionally defined immature Ly6Chi myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) seen in human and animal
sepsis, in that these less-differentiated Ly6Chi monocytes are not only immune suppressive (with elevated
immune suppressor PD-L1 and reduced immune activator CD86), but also highly pathogenic inflammatory (with
sustained ROS, and elevated inflammatory mediators S100A8/9, CD38 and CX43), characteristic of septic
monocytes from human patients and animals with experimental sepsis. Instead of the traditional narrow definition
of MDSC partially emphasizing their immune-suppressive features, we propose the holistic concept of
“exhausted memory monocytes” encompassing both immune suppression and pathogenic inflammation.
Mechanistically, we recently reported that the less-studied TLR4 adaptor molecule TRAM is critically involved in
the generation of exhausted monocytes, and that TRAM deletion can alleviate experimental sepsis. Based on
these novel findings, our long-term goal is to define novel therapeutic targets for relieving innate immune
exhaustion and preventing/treating sepsis. As a crucial first step, our key objective is to better characterize the
generation of “memory” exhausted monocytes and key underlying mechanisms. We plan to test the central
hypothesis that the generation of monocyte exhaustion memory during sepsis pathogenesis are mediated by the
novel TRAM signaling circuitry, and that targeting TRAM will hold a therapeutic potential in restoring monocyte
homeostasis and preventing/treating severe sepsis. To test this hypothesis, we plan to perform the following
integrated studies. Aim 1. To test the novel phenotypic hypothesis that TRAM mediates the generation of memory
exhausted monocytes during sepsis. Aim 2. To characterize novel mechanisms underlying TRAM-mediated
generation of exhausted monocytes. Aim 3. To examine the translational potential of sepsis intervention via
reprogramming exhausted monocytes. Completion of this project will holistically reveal important and novel
mechanisms responsible for the generation of monocyte exhaustion memory leading to sepsis pathogenesis,
and facilitate the development of effective therapeutic strategies in restoring monocyte homeostasis and
reducing sepsis mortality/morbidity."
10829466,"Project Summary - The role of macrophages in hepatobiliary development
The liver is a vital metabolic organ, involved in nutrient metabolism and detoxification of
endogenous and exogenous products. To manage exposure to antigens and microbes, the liver
harbors ~80% of the body’s residential macrophages. The role of macrophages in liver
development is completely unknown. In our preliminary work we demonstrate that genetic or
induced loss of macrophages severely affects hepatobiliary development, reducing biliary tree
branching and affecting hepatocyte polarization. The objective in our proposed work is to employ
macrophage-deficient zebrafish and transgenic reporter strains combined with high-resolution
confocal imaging and novel image analysis methods to determine the importance of macrophages
for liver development. Our central hypothesis is that macrophages are attracted to the developing
liver bud by a temporal and location-specific expression of TNFα, and that macrophages mediate
their effect on hepatobiliary development through modulation of TGFβ signaling. Two Specific
Aims are proposed to define the role of macrophages for normal hepatobiliary development
development. In Specific Aim 1 we will identify the exact periods during development when
macrophages interact with the liver, and how their loss affects normal development and function.
Specific Aim2 will define the molecular signals by which macrophages are attracted to the
developing liver, and how macrophage-derived TGFβ signaling affects liver development. Our
proposed work will provide critical new mechanistic insight into the contribution of macrophages
to normal hepatobiliary development, and further elucidate the pathogenesis of developmental
biliary defects in childhood."
10830472,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The prevalence of opioid use disorder (OUD) during pregnancy has increased by nearly 500% over the past 15
years. While motivation for and compliance with OUD treatment during pregnancy is heightened, up to 80% of
postpartum individuals with OUD relapse to illicit opioid use within six months of childbirth. A growing body of
evidence indicates that, in the general population, positive social connectedness and strong social bonds are
associated with improved OUD recovery outcomes (e.g., reduced craving, lower risk of relapse). Conversely,
loneliness and social isolation are significant predictors of opioid misuse and relapse, particularly for women.
Loneliness increases during transitional periods including from pregnancy to postpartum, signaling increased
risk for adverse recovery outcomes. Moreover, relapse risk during the fourth trimester (i.e., the time from delivery
to postpartum week 12) may be compounded by unique postpartum stressors, including postpartum depression
and anxiety, sleep disturbances, heightened need for pain management, and caregiving-specific stress. Our
overall goal is to understand the role of social connectedness in OUD-related recovery outcomes, specifically
during the postpartum fourth trimester, an ideal inflection point with untapped potential. To achieve this goal we
will pursue three aims. The first two aims will utilize existing data (derived from DP2-HD105541; PI: Allen) from
50 participants with OUD and 25 control participants who were followed from pregnancy through five months
postpartum. Using ecological momentary assessments (EMA) paired with medical record data, we will assess
social connectedness and OUD-related recovery outcomes. We will evaluate differing theoretical models of
social connectedness in this population by testing the main and stress-buffering effects of social connectedness
on recovery outcomes up to one year postpartum (Aim 1). Additionally, we will characterize dynamic changes in
social connectedness across the fourth trimester and how patterns/changes relate to mothers’ recovery
outcomes (Aim 2). Lastly, we will complete key informant interviews with 30 participants from the target
population to explore the feasibility, acceptability, and opportunities for intervention to enhance social
connectedness to improve the treatment of OUD and prevent postpartum relapse (Aim 3). The results of this
study, regardless of outcome, will directly contribute to scientific knowledge on the role of social connectedness
in postpartum OUD recovery. Moreover, this work will allow for the identification of new intervention targets,
which will contribute to the development of novel, high-impact relapse prevention treatments tailored to the fourth
trimester, a unique inflection point with ample untapped opportunity. This will be directly impactful to the 80,000-
120,000 women, infants, and families suffer the consequences of perinatal OUD every year."
10799662,"Summary
TCR recognition of peptides bound and presented by MHC proteins underlies cellular immunity. TCR recognition
of pMHC is most often viewed through the lens of traditional receptor-ligand theory, where cellular responses
are presumed to be governed by solution binding affinities or kinetics. While this is often the case, work over the
past several years has shown that complexities from mechanical forces exerted on membrane bound TCR and
pMHC can profoundly influence T cell signaling. Of notable interest are catch bonds: force dependent
enhancements of the lifetimes of TCR-pMHC complexes formed between interacting cells. Catch bonds can lead
to large changes in signaling output and can greatly enhance T cell sensitivity. Demonstrating the importance of
mechanical forces in tuning T cell responses, ligands that are recognized with strong affinity but fail to result in
catch bonds yield altered or even no T cell signaling. Force-dependent behavior has been implicated in a wide
range of T cell biological processes, including thymic education, responses to viral or tumor antigens, and viral
escape. Although the importance of mechanical force in TCR recognition has been demonstrated, we have only
a rudimentary understanding of how TCRs form catch or revert to slip bonds. We (PI Evavold) have had recent
success in manipulating TCR catch bonds (published in Science this year) but this was achieved through
screening libraries and without an understanding of mechanism. We thus lack predictive models for force
dependent behavior in TCRs and in turn how this affects biology, which in turn impacts our ability to predict
immunogenicity, assess the consequences of mutations, and hinders our ability to understand T cell specificity.
Recently, however, we developed a comprehensive framework to identify, manipulate, and predict force
dependent behavior in TCR-pMHC interactions. Unlike prior efforts, our framework directly addresses
mechanism. Here, we will further develop, refine, and apply our framework. Our driving hypothesis is that viewing
force dependent behavior through the lens of energy will provide the missing mechanistic detail of how and why
catch bonds emerge in TCRs, allow their rational prediction and manipulation, and permit force considerations
to be included in assessments of T cell recognition of antigen. Our three Aims are to 1) further develop our
mechanistic framework for force dependent TCR behavior; 2) explain how changes to catch bonds emerge from
natural variations in TCR interfaces and how catch bonds regulate T cell biology; and 3) Use rational catch bond
engineering to better control viral infection in mice. Overall, the work in this proposal will illuminate the opaque
mechanisms that underlie T cell mechanobiology, place catch bonds on a formal mechanistic footing, and
provide the means to predict and productively manipulate TCR catch bonds and ultimately T cell biology."

Management of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) treatment has been revolutionized by the identification of
activating mutations in KIT and PDGFRA and clinical application of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in advanced
disease. However, resistance to all approved lines of TKIs is a life-threatening clinical obstacle in metastatic
GIST patients, who have polyclonal tumors comprised of a variety of resistance mutations in KIT/PDGFRA.
Development of effective treatment strategies for refractory GIST requires identification of novel targets. Using
kinome profiling and loss-of function assays, we found that GIST are exquisitely dependent on Wee1 activity.
Wee1 has long been known as a critical G2/M cell cycle checkpoint gatekeeper controlling genomic integrity and
regulating proliferation. However, recent studies have implicated Wee1, both directly and indirectly, in other
cellular functions, including restoration of stalled replication forks and chromatin remodeling. Transcriptome
profiling of TKI-sensitive GIST cell lines highlighted a role for oncogenic KIT/PDGFRA in DNA damage response
(DDR) and replication stress. Our in vitro and in vivo studies revealed significant efficacy of adavosertib (Wee1
inhibitor) in combination with avapritinib (KIT/PDGFRA inhibitor) in TKI-sensitive KIT and PDGFRA-mutant GIST
lines and in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model. Furthermore, our preliminary data in the TKI-refractory
setting demonstrated therapeutic synergies between Wee1 inhibition and the topoisomerase II inhibitor,
doxorubicin, at low nanomolar concentrations in a panel of TKI-resistant GIST cell lines, suggesting Wee1
inhibition sensitizes refractory GIST to doxorubicin, providing viable targets beyond KIT and PDGFRA. We
hypothesize that oncogenic KIT/PDGFRA activates DDR proteins to inhibit replicative stress and DNA damage
and maintain genomic stability in GIST leading to resistance to DNA damaging agents. Our preliminary findings
provide a strong premise that Wee1 is a critical mediator of this process and that its inhibition has potential in
the treatment of GIST tumors. Studies interrogating mechanisms of Wee1 and KIT/PDGFRA cooperativity in
response to DNA damage and replication stress in GIST are warranted to understand this critical cell-protective
mechanism in GIST, which may represent a novel therapeutic vulnerability. Ultimately, this proposal seeks to
test the hypothesis that Wee1 inhibition will be a valuable addition to current treatments for GIST patients with
TKI-sensitive or -resistant disease. We believe that the studies outlined in this proposal will provide novel insights
into the role of Wee1 in maintaining genomic integrity as well as preclinical data to support clinical trials in GIST."

hyperglycemia. We found that insulin resistance rather than beta cell failure is the predominant cause of
hyperglycemia in acute COVID-19. The insulin sensitizing hormone adiponectin is diminished in the circulation
of COVID-19 patients compared to controls. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect
adipocytes. Importantly, we find replicating virus in adipose tissues of both autopsy samples from COVID-19
patients and in mouse and hamster experimental models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Together these data suggest
that SARS-CoV-2 triggers adipose tissue dysfunction to drive insulin resistance and adverse outcomes in acute
COVID-19. In this proposal, we seek to follow up on these studies and assess the mechanisms driving adipose
tissue dysfunction in acute and recovered models of COVID-19. We will pursue the following specific aims: 1.
Assess the impact of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection on glucose homeostasis in obese and non-obese mice. 2.
Map the spatiomolecular interactions and dissect the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in
adipose. 3. Determine the long-term glycometabolic consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The overall goal
of these studies is to assess how COVID-19 can drive adipose tissue dysfunction and hyperglycemia and will
shed light on novel targets to combat metabolic complications induced by COVID-19."

Surgical treatment of joint fractures and dislocations following orthopaedic trauma requires accurate reduction and
fixation of the joint space to restore anatomical integrity. In ankle fractures with syndesmotic injuries, inaccuracies in
proper realignment are associated with chronic functional impairment, mechanical instability, and increased risk of
osteoarthritis. Despite the prevalent role of intraoperative x-ray imaging, uncertainties in spatial reckoning of 3D joint
morphology and challenges in hand-eye coordination can result in malreduction rates of up to 39–52% for fellowship-
trained orthopedic trauma specialists.
This proposal presents a novel system that combines intraoperative imaging, using low-dose CBCT and 3D-2D image
registration, with robotic manipulation of the bones to precisely restore joint integrity. The solution offers quantitative
analysis of morphology from 3D and 2D intraoperative images and precisely guides a robotic instrument without the need
for and the limitations associated with conventional tracked navigation. The following aims develop and evaluate the
approach for treatment of syndesmotic injuries in ankle trauma surgery:
(Aim 1) Develop a surgical robot for joint reduction. (1a) Design a novel low-profile, radiolucent robotic system to
manipulate the distal fibula. (1b) Build the device and develop software to control the robot position and orientation. (1c)
Evaluate basic operation in preclinical testing on cadaveric ankle specimens.
(Aim 2) Develop image-based planning and confirmation of joint reduction. (2a) Develop automatic 3D image analysis of
the tibio-fibulo-talar space from low-dose CBCT and match the dislocated joint to the normal contralateral side. (2b)
Develop 3D-2D image registration techniques to register the robot and confirm accurate restoration of the joint space
from as few as 2 fluoroscopic views. (2c) Experimentally validate the algorithms on cadaveric ankle specimens.
(Aim 3) Perform system integration and end-to-end evaluation of performance. (3a) Integrate the methods from Aims 1
and 2 to guide and confirm robotic manipulation from intraoperative images. (3b) Evaluate the system in cadaver
specimens emulating ankle trauma, targeting less than 2 mm and 5° error in joint realignment.
(Aim 4) Conduct clinical evaluation of safety and feasibility. Conduct clinical studies to (4a) observe standard of care of
ankle fracture surgery and (4b) assess the basic safety and feasibility of the image-based robotic approach in a first in-
human clinical trial with 10 patients.
Successful completion of the aims will elevate the precision and quality of surgery in an area that currently suffers poor
long-term outcomes through use of new methods that are consistent with existing workflows. Success in this research will
help to eliminate revision surgeries due to malreduction (a major cost burden) and improve long-term quality of life for
>100,000 patients/year. The platform will be developed in a multi-disciplinary consortium of experts in robotics, imaging,
and orthopedic surgery and translated to clinical studies. The technology developed will impact trauma surgery beyond
ankle repair and would be applicable to surgical treatment of other challenging joint dislocations and long-bone fractures."
10907577,"Alcohol abuse disorders (AUD) are a major health hazard that affects millions of people every year in the
United States. Risk factors for AUD include initial resistance to the intoxicating effects of alcohol, as well as
the development of tolerance upon repeat exposure. AUDs also have significant genetic etiology, and many
genes have been implicated from human genome-wide association studies (GWAS), including by our studies.
A detailed molecular understanding of many of these genes is still lacking, though. “Regulation of the actin
cytoskeleton” has been implicated by numerous mammalian alcohol transcriptomics studies, and major
regulators of actin dynamics include the Rho family of GTPases, and their regulators. Our findings, supported
by prior funding periods of this competitive renewal grant, have shown that SNPs in the Rho GTPase regulator
RSU1 are associated with alcohol dependence and drinking, underscoring the translational significance of our
studies. Our overall goal is to better understand the molecular mechanisms and neural tissue-specificity of
Rho GTPase regulators using the powerful genetic toolkit of Drosophila. Based on our prior findings and
extensive preliminary data, we hypothesize that different Rho GTPase regulators have distinct alcohol
response phenotypes, depending on the neural circuits they are manipulated in. We will first determine the
circuits and neurotransmitter systems that require regulators of the Rac1 GTPase from the Rho family for
normal alcohol-induced sedation and tolerance. Second, we will determine the role in alcohol sedation and
tolerance of 11 additional members of Rho GTPase signaling, including 8 orthologs of genes associated with
addiction/alcohol phenotypes in human GWAS studies. These candidates have been suggested by alcohol-
induced changes in accessibility of their DNA regulatory regions, as determined by our ATAC-seq experiments.
The data also highlight four transcription factors, based on the overrepresentation of their binding motifs in
alcohol-induced changes of accessible DNA regulatory elements. In a third aim, we will determine the role of
two of these potential master regulators of alcohol-induced changes in gene regulation and in behavioral
alcohol responses. The use of ATAC-seq to determine DNA regulatory elements in a tissue specific manner
highlights a major innovative approach of our application. Taken together, these Aims are in line with NIAAA
priorities focusing on the “Genetics of Alcohol Sensitivity and Tolerance”PA-18-660, which emphasize specific
areas of research interest including “translational research in model organisms…for in vivo validation of
candidate genes…from studies in humans”, and “studies of candidate genes…for tissue-specific gene
expression, and for contributions to biological pathways”. Many prior publications linked to this grant, together
with extensive preliminary data demonstrate the expertise of the investigator and the feasibility of the study.
Our proven translational approach from Drosophila to humans will therefore have direct impact on the
understanding of the function of human addiction genes."

Development of Robust and Low-cost Vaccines for Preventing S. Paratyphi A:
 Salmonella enterica is a Gram-negative bacterium that is a leading cause of foodborne illnesses
globally. In fact, Salmonella deaths are the first cause of death within enteric and diarrheal diseases and the
second cause of death in under 5-years-old. GSK Vaccines Institute for Global Health (GVGH) is developing
two multivalent Pan-Salmonella vaccines based on a versatile platform, Generalized Modules for Membrane
Antigens (GMMA). These vaccines target the same S. Paratyphi A antigen, but are based on different
technologies, conjugate or GMMA, and are intended to provide protection from paratyphoid fever which causes
potentially severe and sometimes life-threatening febrile illness.
 GVGH will complete three Aims within this grant structure. First, preclinical studies will be conducted to
evaluate safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity. Second, process development work for drug substance
and drug product will be completed and manufacturing of both non-GMP and GMP batches will follow. Finally,
a series of experiments will evaluate the immunological response in either mouse or rabbit models; the data
package will include classification of antibody subclasses, affinity and bactericidal activity to provide a
correlation between the quality of antibodies and functionality.
 The final milestone of this grant is to advance the development of a multivalent vaccine against S.
Paratyphi A. This will enable GVGH to make clinical trials possible for the improvement of health for individuals
worldwide."

Individuals with cancer must overcome multiple, ongoing challenges (“self-advocate”) related to their cancer
experience to receive patient-centered care. Women with metastatic breast or advanced gynecologic cancer
often face significant challenges managing their quality of life concerns and cancer- and treatment-related
symptoms. If they do not self-advocate to manage these concerns, they risk having poor quality of life, high
symptom burden, and care that is not patient-centered. Serious games (video games that teach) are effective
health interventions that allow users to vicariously engage in situations reflecting their personal experiences,
receive meaningful information, and learn personally relevant skills that they can apply in real life. The long-
term objective of this work is to prepare patients with cancer to engage in patient-centered care by teaching
them self-advocacy skills using immersive, accessible technologies. The goal of the current study is to test the
efficacy of a novel intervention using a serious game platform to teach self-advocacy skills to women with
metastatic breast or advanced gynecologic cancer. The Strong Together intervention consists of a multi-
session, interactive serious game application with tailored self-advocacy goal-setting and training. The serious
game is based on a self-advocacy conceptual framework and applies behavior change theories and serious
game mechanisms to promote skill development and implementation. The game works by immersing users in
the experiences of characters who are women with advanced cancer; requiring users to make decisions about
how the characters self-advocate; demonstrating the positive and negative consequences of self-advocating or
not, respectively; and providing multiple, individualized feedback mechanisms and game features to enforce
self-advocacy skill acquisition and transference to real life. This study evaluates the efficacy of the Strong
Together intervention by conducting a randomized clinical trial in 336 adult (ages >18 years) women within
three months of a metastatic breast or Stage III or IV gynecologic cancer diagnosis. Participants will be
randomly assigned to receive the 3-month Strong Together intervention or a paper self-advocacy guide. The
primary outcome is patient self-advocacy. Secondary outcomes include quality of life, symptom burden, and
patient-centered care. The central hypothesis is that the experimental group will have higher self-advocacy,
quality of life, and patient-centered care and lower symptom burden compared to the paper self-advocacy
guide group. As an exploratory outcome, we will determine if the intervention reduces suboptimal healthcare
utilization. The study will also evaluate the behavioral and game mechanisms that influence the efficacy of the
Strong Together intervention. This study provides the first theoretically based self-advocacy intervention for
adult women with cancer and clarifies the mechanisms by which serious games teach skills and assist in
transferring those skills to real life. Self-advocacy interventions have the potential to advance patient-centered
care by providing patients with tangible skills that prepare them to meaningful engage in their cancer care."

Title: Dynamics and evolution of synthetic and natural gene regulatory networks
Human tissues or microbial cell populations can consist of millions of cells, each of which contains
billions of molecules. Central among these molecules, DNA stores information in protein-coding
genes, but also in noncoding, gene-regulatory regions. Gene products binding to such regions or to
each other form complex gene regulatory networks that influence the behavior of individual cells and
thereby cell populations. DNA sequence mutations can alter these networks as cell populations adapt
to various environments, contributing to genetic evolution. Yet, to thoroughly understand adapting and
evolving cell populations, we must also ask how cells and thereby cell populations respond to gene
network dynamics and stochasticity, apart from or combined with DNA mutations. Answering these
questions should deepen the understanding of the behavior and evolution of cell populations, which
underlie cancer progression and microbial drug resistance.
Before 2017, we developed computational models of natural gene regulatory networks to understand
how they modulate nongenetic diversity in cell populations and designed synthetic gene circuits to
control the variability of protein expression in yeast and mammalian cells. Since 2017, with MIRA
support we started bringing these research directions closer, by seeking control points in natural gene
networks and devising synthetic gene circuits to control expression patterns of native genes in space
and time. We will now combine and study natural and synthetic gene networks by precisely perturbing
the expression of specific native genes, to examine subsequent effects on the native gene network,
single-cell and cell population phenotypes, as well as evolution by computational modeling, single-cell
analysis and experimental evolution. Overall, these studies will reveal how complex networks enable
biological control across disparate scales of space and time, from molecules to cells, from seconds to
weeks. Addressing these questions will teach us how to control evolving cell populations, which is
relevant for understanding, predicting and possibly preventing cancer and microbial drug resistance."

The MUSC Specialized Center of Research Excellence (SCORE) on Sex Differences in substance use disorders
and the relationship between stress and relapse has been highly productive for 20 years. In addition to coalescing
a multidisciplinary group of investigators across different disciplines working closely together to explore sex and
gender differences in substance use disorders and the relationship between stress and drug use, the MUSC
SCORE has provided a fertile training ground for new investigators and attracted senior investigators to apply
their skills to sex- and gender-specific research. During the proposed renewal period, we will continue to reach
across the MUSC campus, state of South Carolina, and nationwide through cross-SCORE collaborations and
other initiatives focused on dissemination of research findings to improve health outcomes. The science within
our research group also will grow with four tightly integrated research projects. To address critical public health
needs, the proposed research projects will investigate sex differences in cannabis use disorders across the
lifespan, focusing on populations (emerging adults, postpartum women, and older adults) with recent rapid
increases in cannabis use and potential vulnerability to sex disparate harms of cannabis. The specific aims of
this SCORE are to support and enhance translational scientific collaborations among the investigators
conducting primary and pilot research projects, catalyze further growth of interdisciplinary sex- and gender-based
research on the MUSC campus, continue foundational research training for Early Career Investigators dedicated
to sex and gender-focused translational research, and promote strategic partnerships to enhance the translation
and dissemination of SCORE findings and other relevant research to improve health outcomes."
10898732,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Among the physiological systems most important to brain development in emerging adulthood is the
endocannabinoid system, which among other roles facilitates cognitive and behavioral processing, including the
underpinnings of stress management and resiliency. Sex differences in endocannabinoid system development
have been identified, and emerging evidence indicates a bidirectional relationship between stress exposure and
the endocannabinoid system during emerging adulthood. Repeated exposure to exogenous cannabinoids, such
as those administered via cannabis use, perturbates endocannabinoid system development, which may
adversely affect the programming of future coping in a manner that differs by sex. Use of cannabis, which exerts
its psychoactive effects via delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol binding to endocannabinoid receptors, is more common
among emerging adults than in any other age group. Many regular users develop a maladaptive, impairing
pattern of use characterized as cannabis use disorder (CUD). A constellation of preliminary evidence suggests
several factors disproportionately complicate CUD in females compared to males; the salience of these factors
in emerging adulthood indicates that this developmental stage deserves focused sex differences research to
inform clinical management. A central running thread is the importance of stress and stress-reactivity across
endocannabinoid system development, cannabis use, CUD, cannabis withdrawal, and relapse to cannabis use.
We propose an experiment that combines rigorous ecological momentary assessment (EMA), controlled human
laboratory procedures, and innovative bioassay collection. Emerging adult cannabis users with CUD (ages 18-
25, N=148, 1:1 female to male ratio) will undergo 3 days of reinforced abstinence with EMA monitoring of
cannabis withdrawal and stress-related symptoms, followed by a standardized laboratory stress induction
paradigm. Blood levels of endocannabinoid system markers will be assessed before and after the abstinence
period; during the lab session, self-report measures and biomarkers of stress reactivity will be collected. Double-
blind cannabidiol (CBD) versus placebo dosing before the laboratory stress paradigm will allow for examination
of effects on stress response during withdrawal. Prior work indicates CBD administration reduces stress
response in general populations and preliminary research suggests this effect may extend to cannabis users;
this has not been rigorously applied to induced stress amid cannabis withdrawal in emerging adults with CUD, a
context particularly important for females with CUD who often report using cannabis to cope with stress.
Following the laboratory session, EMA monitoring will resume as participants return to ad libitum cannabis use,
providing the opportunity to test associations between stress reactivity and time to resumption of use. The
proposed study is designed to elucidate sex differences and guide the development of tailored treatments that
address factors disproportionately affecting emerging adult females with CUD."
10898734,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cannabis use in women is increasing, but patterns of use are often interrupted during pregnancy. Many women
(73-78%) who regularly use cannabis preconception quit or cut down their use of cannabis during pregnancy.
However, almost 80% of women return to cannabis use within 4-5 months postpartum despite the potential for
poor newborn and maternal health outcomes. Stress and progesterone may play important roles in the return to
postpartum cannabis use for women. Women are vulnerable to stress-related relapse to substance use. Stress,
anxiety, depression, and sleep deficiencies are common in the perinatal period and have been linked to
substance use and relapse. Over 80% of perinatal women report stress and anxiety relief as the most common
reason for using cannabis postpartum. Progesterone may attenuate drug reward and drug seeking behavior,
and there is encouraging pilot data suggesting that progesterone may help to prevent postpartum relapse to
tobacco and cocaine, but the relationship between progesterone and postpartum cannabis use has yet to be
studied. Given the rapid decline in progesterone following birth and the stressful nature of the postpartum period,
longitudinal investigations are needed to examine the temporal relationships between stress, progesterone and
return to cannabis use in postpartum women. The long-term goal of this work is to develop gender-specific,
targeted interventions that prevent postpartum return to cannabis use. The short-term goal of this study is to
leverage the predictable, real-world naturalistic stressor of the postpartum period, combined with daily diaries
and Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) to elucidate the proximal relationships between stress,
progesterone and return to postpartum cannabis use. In the proposed study we will use daily Ecological
Momentary Assessment (EMA) to determine patterns of change in stress, craving, anxiety, mood, and sleep that
may be associated with return to postpartum cannabis use during the 12-week postpartum period. We
hypothesize that increased measures of subjective stress, anxiety and craving, along with reductions in mood
and sleep quality, will be associated with return to cannabis use. We will also measure salivary progesterone to
determine the association between salivary progesterone levels and return to postpartum cannabis use. We
hypothesize that for individual participants, decreased levels of progesterone will be associated with return to
postpartum cannabis use. We will explore the correlation of within-subject changes in EMA measures,
progesterone and return to postpartum cannabis use and hypothesize that: 1) there will be a negative correlation
between changes in progesterone and subjective stress ratings; and 2) the relationship between progesterone
and cannabis use will be mediated by changes in subjective stress ratings. These data with inform the
development of targeted sex-specific treatment and prevention interventions to reduce postpartum cannabis use
and improve women’s health."

Primary cilia are sensory organelles of a few microns that are present on most vertebrate cells. They convert
surrounding cues into intracellular signals that are critical for cellular functions. The cilium concentrates key
regulators of the Sonic Hedgehog pathway and a wide range of versatile classes of molecules, including G
protein-coupled receptors and second messengers. Despite the clear importance of cilia during embryonic
development and the homeostasis of many tissues and organs, the mechanisms that govern the regulation of
cilia themselves remain unclear. Primary cilia dysfunction causes a variety of developmental syndromes with
neurological defects and cognitive impairment. Even though most neurons have a primary cilium, it is still
unknown how this organelle modulates neuron morphology and connectivity. The long-term goals of my
research group are to i) discover novel mechanisms and processes that govern cilium biogenesis, ii) define the
fundamentals of how and why the cilium dynamically remodels itself, and iii) uncover the underexplored roles of
neuronal cilia in the brain. In the absence of such knowledge, identifying potential tractable modifiers of cilia
regulation will remain difficult, particularly in the brain. We employ an interdisciplinary approach using unbiased
screening strategies, mouse models, cutting-edge microscopy, and cell and molecular biology. The
advancements made over the last five years have been critical in identifying novel molecular foundations of
primary cilia dynamics and ciliary composition in neurons. We will keep building on these first steps to help
advance therapeutic strategies targeting perturbed ciliary pathways."

Mitochondria house the metabolism of all building blocks of life and are central for cellular metabolism,
however, how metabolites translocate across the mitochondrial membrane is poorly understood; and the
impact on neuronal cellular metabolism is yet to be explored. The mitochondrial carrier SLC25 family
represents the largest protein family critical for mitochondrial metabolite transport, in which approximately
20 out of the 53 human SLC25 genes remain of unknown function. Our overarching research program is
to characterize mitochondrial metabolite transport by identifying the endogenous metabolite ligands for
SLC25 transporters. Recently, my laboratory applied mitochondrial metabolomics to discover the role of a
poorly characterized mitochondrial transporter SLC25A39 in glutathione uptake (supported by R00). Here,
building upon this recent progress, we propose to expand the strategy to other SLC25 transporters using
loss-of-function and gain-of-function study in cells. As a distinct and complementary approach, we will
apply sequence and structure analysis towards SLC25 transporter to guide in vitro mitochondrial
metabolite uptake screen with a goal to characterize ligand recognition mechanism. To study mitochondrial
metabolism in neurons, we will adopt iPSC-derived neurons as an in vitro model to profile the impact of
SLC25 transporters loss on mitochondrial and synaptic metabolism. Together, our study of SLC25
transporters would reveal fundamental biology in mitochondrial metabolite transport, an emerging new
frontier in cellular metabolism. Our expertise in cellular metabolism, uniquely in applying state-of-art, high-
resolution mass spec metabolomics to fundamental biochemistry and cell biology, is perfectly suited for
the research direction. The ESI-MIRA program enables launching my research career in cellular
metabolism as well as moving into a new research area in neuronal cell biology. The flexibility in the funding
mechanism allows this ambitious project to systematically decode mitochondrial metabolite transport."
10893485,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tourette Syndrome and persistent tic disorders (collectively TS) are characterized by the childhood onset of tics
that cause functional impairment and persist into adulthood in most cases. Alongside tics, patients with TS
experience premonitory urges and comorbid mental health conditions (e.g., anxiety, ADHD, OCD, depression)
that all diminish quality of life. Presently, only two evidence-based treatments exist for patients with TS: behavior
therapy and pharmacotherapy. Behavior therapy is recommended as the first-line treatment for TS. However,
60% of adults with TS do not respond to behavior therapy and it does not confer any benefit for common
comorbid mental health conditions. It is also inaccessible for many. Less than 20% of adults with TS receive
behavior therapy because of limited accessibility to trained TS providers. Consequently, most adults with TS rely
on FDA-approved medications for tic management, which infrequently produce tic remission and are often
discontinued due to adverse health effects. Thus, it is critical to identify new safe, efficacious, and accessible
treatments to improve therapeutic outcomes and quality of life for adults with TS. In response, our team has
developed an online mindfulness-based group intervention for tics (MBIT). Our pilot clinical trial compared group
MBIT to group psychoeducation, relaxation, and supportive therapy (PRST) in adults with TS. All interventions
and assessments were delivered remotely using secure telehealth platforms and online electronic data capture
systems. MBIT was found to be feasible, acceptable, and efficacious for reducing tic severity and impairment
relative to PRST. Additionally, MBIT produced improvement in comorbid mental health conditions, and sustained
benefit for up to 6-months. Building on this work, we will conduct a randomized clinical trial (RCT) that: (1) tests
the efficacy of MBIT for reducing tic severity, (2) examines the mechanism by which MBIT reduces tic severity,
(3) evaluates the secondary benefit of MBIT for comorbid mental health conditions and quality of life, and (4)
explores the long-term benefit of MBIT. Here, 150 adults with TS with moderate or greater tic severity will
participate. Adults will complete a baseline assessment to characterize tic severity, premonitory urge severity,
the severity of comorbid mental health conditions, and quality of life. Next, participants will be randomized to 8
weekly sessions of group MBIT or group PRST in a 1:1 ratio. Participants will complete mid-treatment, post-
treatment, 1-month and 3-month follow-up assessments. Participants receiving MBIT will also complete a 6-
month follow-up to assess its sustained benefit. All ratings will be made by an independent evaluator (IE) masked
to treatment condition. Findings will establish a new, accessible, evidence-based treatment for adults with TS
that comprehensively reduces tic severity, improves co-occurring mental health conditions and quality of life, and
produces lasting therapeutic benefit. This intervention and its remote group delivery approach provides a
practical, scalable, and sustainable solution to improve therapeutic outcomes for adults with TS."
10846656,"Project Summary
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to provide new information about the
specific brain circuits which enable us to regulate our posture, movements, and arousal levels when we are
exposed to unexpected stimuli or potentially threatening conditions. Several psychiatric and neurological
disorders are associated with impairments in motor tone and arousal regulation which manifest as sensory
hypersensitivity, excessive startle reactivity, and increased anxiety. This research focuses on the cerebellum, a
part of the brain known best for its role in coordinating movements and learning to anticipate when and how to
move, but is also important for regulating wake-state arousal levels. Researchers and clinicians currently lack
specific information needed to develop and target new therapeutic treatments to patients who suffer from
dysregulation of defensive arousal. The specific objectives of this project are to provide anatomical,
physiological, and functional information about specific cerebellar cell types which regulate movements of the
trunk, head and eyes and levels of arousal via their synaptic connections with brainstem control centers. To
achieve these objectives, anatomical circuit analyses will map differential synaptic connectivity of specific
cerebellar neurons, neurophysiological analyses will be used to monitor activity in specific types of cerebellar
neurons under conditions of spontaneous and sensory- evoked arousal, and behavioral and physiological
analyses will determine the impact of manipulating activity of specific cerebellar cell types on the online and
learned regulation of arousal responses to unexpected or potentially threatening stimuli. These experiments
will provide a critical foundation for developing pharmacological or neurostimulation therapies for treating
patients who suffer from impairments in the abiilty to regulate how they respond to unexpected threatening
stimuli.

10906157,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Previous in vivo studies on this project using a humanized mouse model of sickle cell disease (SCD) have
revealed that activated neutrophils play a direct role in vaso-occlusive episodes (VOE) by interacting with
circulating erythrocytes. In particular, we have described that aged neutrophils (i.e. those that have spent the
most time in circulation) are the most active and this aging phenotype is driven by to the microbiota. Indeed,
microbiota depletion markedly reduces aged neutrophil counts, and improves the acute and chronic SCD
manifestations. In the past funding cycle, we have evaluated how psychological stress exacerbates VOE by
inducing a glucocorticoid response that alters gut permeability, exposing specific commensals (segmented
filamentous bacteria), leading to the increased generation of aged neutrophils via IL-17A/G-CSF cytokine
induction. In preliminary data supporting this proposal, we have further investigated neuro-immunology in SCD
pathogenesis. As pain is a major manifestation of the disease, we have evaluated the impact of nociceptor
activation in VOE and organ damage and found, unexpectedly, a protective role of nociceptor activation mediated
by the neurotransmitter calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Activation of nociceptor nerves with capsaicin
also reduced VOE and organ damage. In Specific Aim 1, we will investigate the mechanisms by which
nociceptors inhibit SCD-associated vaso-occlusion. We will investigate the role of RAMP1 in transducing the
CGRP inhibitory signals into neutrophils using genetically deficient mice. We evaluate whether capsaicin
improves VOE by activating TRPV1+ neurons vs possible effects on the microbiota. Based on preliminary data
implicating histone deacetylases inhibitors in neutrophil aging, we will evaluate in Specific Aim 2 molecular
mechanisms orchestrating the neutrophil aging program. We will investigate the molecular basis behind the
neutrophil aging program using proteomics analyses. We will also screen for novel markers specific to neutrophil
aging using flow cytometry-based approach to complement the mass spectrometry studies of the proteome. In
Specific Aim 3, we will dissect how the microbiota promotes organ damage in SCD. Preliminary results in which
single antibiotics with narrower spectrum were administered, led us to identify candidate bacteria predicted to
produce beneficial or detrimental effects on organ damage in SCD. We will investigate the interplay between
these microbial candidates and iron deposition in the mechanism of organ damage. We will also analyze the
microbiota of SCD patients (on and off Penicillin or hydroxyurea) with our clinical collaborators and correlate the
results with clinical severity. These studies will enhance our understanding of VOE and organ damage and may
lead to new clinical trials where the manipulation nociceptor signals or the use of specific probiotic therapy may
mitigate SCD pathogenesis."

Preeclampsia is a complex disease of pregnancy involving cardiovascular, immune, and placental dysfunction.
It is the leading cause of maternal-fetal morbidity and mortality. Preventative options are poor and the only
effective treatment is the delivery of the often pre-term fetus and the dysfunctional placenta. The current
proposal aims to investigate the potential of personalized medicine in the form of cellular immunotherapy as
a novel preventative measure for the prevention of preeclampsia.
Elevated secretion of arginine vasopressin precedes the development of physiological symptoms of
preeclampsia in humans, and infusion of vasopressin throughout gestation into wild-type mice is sufficient to
initiate the cardiovascular, renal, and immune dysregulation observed in human preeclampsia. Although
vascular and renal complications are observed clinically in preeclampsia, immune dysfunction is central to the
pathogenesis of preeclampsia. Regulatory dendritic cells have been shown to induce immune tolerance and
are a current cellular immunotherapy in ongoing clinical trials for several other immune mediated diseases.
The proposed study will test the hypothesize that treatment with regulatory dendritic cells will prevent the
cardiovascular, renal, and immune features of preeclampsia.
The overall objective of this proposal is to determine if DCreg administration is a potential preventative for
preeclampsia. In the following aims, utilizing the chronic AVP infusion mouse model of preeclampsia and primary
human mononuclear cells, we will investigate 1) the potential of DCreg to prevent the cardiovascular, renal, and
immune features of preeclampsia in mice and 2) the ability of human mononuclear cells obtained from women
with chronic hypertension and/or preeclampsia to differentiate into functional DCreg.
The vision for my career is to develop an independent, NIH-funded research program that transforms women’s
cardiovascular healthcare through innovative scientific discovery and the education of future scientists. To
continue to grow as an independent investigator and to achieve my career goals, the objective of the career
plan is to develop skills in the following areas: 1) training in assessment of vascular function as it relates to
models of preeclampsia; and 2) developing skills in translational clinical research. These will be accomplished
through both didactic coursework and experiential training through direct interactions with my mentors and
colleagues.
If regulatory dendritic cells prevent preeclampsia in the present study, this data will identify a novel cellular
immunotherapy for preventing preeclampsia. Future studies would be aimed at further understanding the
mechanism(s) of regulatory dendritic cell action and the potential of regulatory dendritic cells in preventing
preeclampsia. This project is innovative as it proposes a powerful, novel treatment as a possible prevention for
preeclampsia: personalized cellular immunotherapy."

Microbes interact with the intestinal epithelium in ways that modulate susceptibility to infection, malnutrition,
and predisposition to chronic metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes. However, the host signaling
pathways utilized by microbes to promote health and disease are poorly understood. The powerful genetic
tools provided by the model arthropod Drosophila melanogaster have enabled many discoveries that form the
basis of our modern understanding of innate immunity. Here we propose to exploit the Drosophila
melanogaster model to define the host signaling pathways that detect intestinal microbes and orchestrate the
innate immune response of the intestinal epithelium.
Drosophila intestinal stem cells, enterocytes and enteroendocrine cells (EECs) carry out functions similar to
those of the mammalian intestine. EECs, which constitute 5-10% of cells in the intestinal epithelium, secrete
enteroendocrine peptides (EEPs) that modulate host metabolic functions such as insulin signaling, satiety, and
intestinal contractions. We have identified a subset of EECs that responds uniquely to the microbial
fermentation product acetate by activating innate immune signaling through the TNF-like Immunodeficiency
(IMD) pathway. In these EECs, IMD signaling increases transcription of the genes encoding EEPs. These
EEPs, in turn, coordinate the response of the diverse cell types in the intestine to microbes. Here we
investigate the mechanism by which microbes activate the intestinal innate immune response and the ultimate
impact of this regulatory pathway on susceptibility to infection.
In this proposal, we will investigate the role of chromatin remodeling in acetate-mediated IMD signaling, the
contribution of peptidoglycan to intestinal IMD signaling, the role of EEPs as cytokines, and finally the cell-
specific roles of EEPs in modulating susceptibility to intestinal infection. The overarching objective of this
research is to uncover novel paradigms of the intestinal innate immune response to microbes with the goal of
informing therapies that modify nutrient utilization in malnutrition, chronic metabolic diseases and susceptibility
to intestinal infection."

SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has infected more than 103M people worldwide (February
2021) with more than 2.25M deaths, and represents a dire threat to the health and economic well-being of the
entire world. Although vaccines seem to be effective against SARS-CoV-2, recent information regarding
potential vaccine resistant strains highlights the importance of alternative strategies to combat this virus. The
development of antiviral therapeutics on important mutation resistant viral proteins such as nsp13 is one such
strategy. Improved knowledge of the molecular mechanisms utilized by nsp13 are necessary to rationally
develop inhibitors. This project will address this deficiency utilizing an integrated multiscale modeling, protein
crystallography, and biochemical approach to define how SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 helicase binds RNA and ATP
substrates, transduces energy during ATP binding and hydrolysis, and changes conformation during ligand
binding and catalysis. We propose the following: 1) Identification of molecular-level components of the RNA-
binding and translocation mechanisms of nsp13. Preliminary all-atom molecular dynamics (aaMD) simulations
of SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 have identified key protein-RNA interactions that will inform initial mutagenesis studies.
Further simulation and protein crystallography will inform on the ATP-dependent protein-RNA interactions
observed in the RNA cleft. Biochemical experiments will be performed to test the structure-function
hypotheses generated by the structural-based approaches. 2) Identification of molecular-level features of the
binding, hydrolysis and product release of ATP by nsp13. We have performed aaMD simulations of the SARS-
CoV-2 nsp13 in all relevant substrate states. Soaked-in ATP and non-hydrolysable analogue protein
crystallography will be performed to test these initial models. Subsequent quantum mechanical calculations
will identify key components of the ATP hydrolysis reaction. Site-directed mutagenesis and well-established
enzyme kinetics assays will be used to test effects predicted by these simulations. 3) Identification of allosteric
networks in SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 that transduce energy from ATP binding and hydrolysis to perform RNA
translocation. Utilizing network analyses of aaMD simulations, Motif V has been identified as a key allosteric
contributor. Biochemical studies will be performed to verify that Motif V is necessary for nsp13 helicase
function. Further work will be done to identify allosteric networks between additional components of the ATP
pocket and RNA cleft identified in Aims 2 and 3. This work will produce unprecedented molecular-level insight
into the translocation mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 helicases. Key components of this mechanism
represent new targets for antiviral development."
10893445,"SUMMARY
This application is for competitive renewal of a grant that over its 20-year course has elucidated the ways in
which the function of the transcription factor CREB and kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) systems within the nucleus
accumbens (NAc) are changed by experience, including stress exposure, and how alterations in their function
affect behavior. We have shown that (a) stress upregulates NAc CREB and KOR signaling, (b) these effects
are sufficient to produce characteristic features of mood and anxiety disorders, and (c) disruption of CREB or
blockade of KORs produces antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects. Recently we have also shown a role for
these systems in sleep and biological (diurnal) rhythms, which are dysregulated across many types of psychiatric
illness. Our work has provided a basis for clinical trials of KOR antagonists to treat depression, which thus far
show great promise. Major goals for Years 21-25 are to further characterize the ways in which NAc CREB and
KOR systems regulate complex behavior and responses to different forms of stressors, including a type of
immune stress relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic, while prioritizing the use of endpoints in rodents with
improved alignment to those used in humans. In Aim 1, we will examine the mechanisms of CREB-mediated
depressive behavior using a new version of a cognitive control task (called the Flanker task) that we developed
to enable testing rats and humans using virtually identical procedures. Specifically, we will determine how
alterations in NAc CREB function in D1- and/or D2-medium spiny neurons (MSNs) affect task performance and
event-related potentials (ERPs)—endpoints known to be aberrant in human depression—in male and female
rats. In Aim 2, we will determine if a regimen of early immune activation (EIA) that produces long-lasting
depressive-like effects in mice causes persistent alterations in NAc CREB and KOR systems. Specifically, we
will use single-nucleus RNA sequencing to comprehensively examine EIA-induced alterations in NAc cell
populations, including MSNs and microglia, and compare and contrast effects in males and females. While
upregulation of NAc CREB and KOR systems is commonly associated with depressive phenotypes, in Aims 3-4
we will examine possible roles in stress resilience. For Aim 3, we will examine how KORs expressed on
microglia, which regulate immune function, affect sensitivity to stress. Specifically, we will examine how ablation
of KORs from microglia affects the ability of chronic stress to disrupt sleep and diurnal rhythms of activity and
body temperature. Similarly, in Aim 4 we will characterize the effects of altering the function of the CREB target
DFosB in D1- or D2-MSNs on stress-induced disruption of sleep and diurnal rhythms, while in parallel examining
effects on CREB, DYN, and KOR expression in NAc MSNs and microglia. All of these studies involve endpoints
(behavioral, molecular) that can also be studied in humans or human tissues. This work will improve our
understanding of the mechanisms by which NAc CREB and KOR function affect domains that are frequently
dysregulated in mood and anxiety disorders, and may enable new ways to diagnose and treat these conditions."
10928760,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Elucidating the role of the Integrated Stress Response pathway in tissue homeostasis
Metazoa have evolved stress response pathways to combat internal and external stressors (e.g.,
nutrient deprivation, changes in environmental conditions, toxic insults). The Integrated Stress
Response (ISR) is one such evolutionarily conserved pathway that mediates adaptation to cellular
stress. Since its discovery in yeast, much effort has been dedicated to studying the role of ISR signaling
in mediating the cellular response to exogenous stress. In higher organisms, many specialized cell
types have evolved to rely on the ISR to maintain homeostasis: notable examples of this include
metabolically active cells such as hepatocytes and adipocytes, highly secretory cells such as b-islet
cells of the pancreas, and neurons with high protein turnover such as photoreceptors. Our current
understanding of ISR signaling in maintaining tissue homeostasis largely comes from phenotypic
observations in loss-of-function mutants, yet little is known about the underlying molecular and cell
biology of such regulation. This proposal seeks to gain new insights into the precise molecular and cell
biological mechanisms governed by ISR signaling in maintaining tissue homeostasis. We will use the
Drosophila fat tissue and ovary as a discovery platform, owing to the breadth of genetic and molecular
biology tools available for manipulation of these tissues.
 The different branches of ISR signaling culminate in the highly conserved transcription factor,
ATF4. We recently described a role for Drosophila ATF4 in the regulation of oogenesis. Our preliminary
data revealed that while some of the oogenesis defects (e.g., oocyte maturation) arise from
autonomous requirement for Atf4 in the ovary, several others (e.g., yolk protein accumulation, egg
laying) are mediated tissue non-autonomously by Atf4 in the fat tissues surrounding the ovary. Based
on these data, we test a role for ISR signaling as a fat tissue metabolic sensor, which informs peripheral
tissue function non-autonomously. Leveraging our extensive background in molecular and cell biology
techniques with powerful Drosophila genetic tools, we will pursue three projects to establish the role for
ISR signaling 1) in regulating steroid hormone signaling in fat tissues, 2) in fat tissue-mediated
neuromodulation, and 3) in the mRNA translational control in the ovary. Gaining molecular
understanding of the role for the ISR in tissue homeostasis will fundamentally inform our approach to
experimentally and therapeutically improve tissue function. The advancements from this study will also
bear vast pathobiological relevance since ISR dysregulation is associated with an ever-increasing
number of diseases, from diabetes to neurodegeneration and cancer."
10861785,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Systemic chronic inflammation (SCI) is a common comorbidity of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), e.g., it affects 25-40% of IBD patients, contributing to
extraintestinal manifestations of IBD. The contribution of postprandial inflammation to the SCI in
those contexts remains unclear. Our preliminary data in T2D patients suggest hyaluronan (HA)
correlates with plasma inflammatory cytokines, and postprandial HA is much higher in T2D
patients, which can be quickly normalized by bariatric surgery. We modeled this postprandial
HA spike in diet-induced obese animal models, and we found this phenomenon was more
pronounced in IBD mouse models. With a new Has2 overexpression mouse model we
generated in a recent publication studying adipose tissue HA, we found circulating HA can
induce hepatic macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (Marco) expression. MARCO
belongs to class A scavenger receptors. MARCO itself is not capable of eliciting inflammation,
but may function with intracellular pattern recognition receptors to stimulate an inflammatory
response. With new mouse models to either delete Marco or overexpress Marco, we showed it
augmented postprandial inflammatory response, and required nucleotide-binding
oligomerization domain containing 1 (NOD1) in this process. Based on these data, we
hypothesize that meal induces quick displacement of HA from the intestinal tract, entering the
circulation to induce Marco expression on liver macrophage – Kupffer cells (KCs). Saturated
fatty acids from the diet use MARCO to be delivered into the cell to activate NOD1 to elicit an
inflammatory response. With several genetically engineered mouse models, we will examine
(A). the mechanism by which HA promotes Marco expression in KCs; (B) the role of liver
macrophage Marco in cytokine secretion; (C) the source of inflammatory stimuli and the direct
effector of KCs inflammatory response in three specific aims. Aim 1 will determine the role of HA
in postprandial hepatic KC Marco expression; Aim 2 will determine the molecular mechanism by
which KC MARCO enhances postprandial inflammation and contributes to SCI; and Aim 3 will
evaluate whether digesting HA or neutralizing MARCO alleviates SCI and related pathologies.
Completing the proposed research will provide novel scientific knowledge on the HA-MARCO
axis in postprandial inflammation and SCI. This knowledge will support the idea of controlling
circulating HA and neutralizing MARCO to combat SCI and related diseases."
10930947,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A hallmark of eukaryotic cells is the ability to compartmentalize essential reactions into membrane-bound and
membrane-less organelles. Membrane-bound organelles form collaborative networks through transport vesicles
and inter-organellar interaction domains to traffic cargo and distribute lipids throughout the cell. Conversely,
membrane-less organelles mobilize the aqueous portion of cells into condensed structures called condensates.
The majority of membrane-less condensates enrich for RNAs and various proteins, which control RNA
processing and function at nearly every step of the mRNA life cycle. We and others have recently identified a
new class of inter-organelle interactions between membrane-bound organelles, such as the endoplasmic
reticulum, and membrane-less RNA-sequestering condensates, such as stress granules. Thus, the long-term
goal of my research program is to define how and why these two types of organelles interact to gain a more
seamless understanding of how the cytoplasm is organized in health and disease. The objective of this proposal
is to identify the factors and utilities of interaction domains between the endoplasmic reticulum and two well-
studied RNA-sequestering condensates. Our central hypothesis is that the endoplasmic reticulum plays crucial
roles in RNA condensate formation, maintenance, and disassembly through the formation of membrane-to-
condensate interactions. Although in vitro and in vivo studies on RNA and protein condensation have revealed
the some molecular and biophysical principles of condensates, the contribution of membranes to condensate
mechanisms are poorly understood. In the first Project, my lab will elucidate how condensate components are
recruited to the endoplasmic reticulum to stimulate RNA condensate formation and inhibition of mRNA
translation. We will use biochemical and live-cell imaging approaches to identify the key membrane factors that
control this new class of interaction domains. These studies will allow us to identify the molecular mechanisms
behind our previous discovery of a surprising dependence of membrane-less condensate abundance on
endoplasmic reticulum morphology. In the second Project, we will dissect endoplasmic reticulum-dependent
mechanisms of stress granule disassembly. Specifically, we will identify new disassembly factors by taking
advantage of our newly developed ability to uncouple stress granule fission from dissolution. Additionally, we will
test whether increasing the rate of endoplasmic reticulum-mediated stress granule fission can drive the
disassembly of disease-associated aggregates. Collectively, this work will reveal how a new cellular niche
between membrane-bound and membrane-less organelles drives the dynamic compartmentalization and quality
control of RNA processes. Therefore, we anticipate that the proposed work will have important implications for
both basic science and translational medicine targeting neurodegeneration, cancer, and RNA viral infection."
10829768,"1 Cannabis is the most used psychoactive substance world-wide. The CNS effects of THC, the
 2 main psychoactive constituent of cannabis, and synthetic cannabinoids are largely attributed
 3 to their agonism of the cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1). CB1 activation can cause effects
 4 including feelings of euphoria, sensory distortion, panic attacks, psychosis, and tachycardia.
 5 Recent legalization of cannabis use in a growing number of U.S. States has led to a rapid
 6 increase in access to a wide range of cannabis products that are more potent, relatively
 7 inexpensive, and easier to obtain. More wide-spread use of cannabis has led to an exponential
8 increase in emergency department visits and hospitalization related to either Acute
 9 Cannabinoid Intoxication (ACI) or to Cannabinoid Hyperemesis syndrome (CHS), which is
10 characterized by severe, repeated bouts of nausea and vomiting that can last from hours up
11 to weeks. Data from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s Healthcare Cost and
12 Utilization Project (HCUP) Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS) indicate that
13 ACI incidence increased by approximately 12% annually between 2006 and 2018, with the
14 largest relative increase in the most recent year among female and pediatric patients. Children
15 are an especially vulnerable group because cannabis edibles are widely available in the form
16 of chocolate and gummies, which are attractive to children and often mistaken for harmless
17 treats. Because of their lower body weight, relative doses are much higher in children, and
18 higher circulating THC concentrations result in greater risk for more serious adverse events
19 associated with ACI, e.g. severe neurological impairment, seizures, loss of consciousness,
20 and coma. Although several CB1 receptor antagonists have shown some promise in inhibiting
21 THC intoxication in early clinical studies, to date no CB1 inhibitor has been approved for
22 treatment of ACI or CHS. To address this serious and growing unmet medical need, Anebulo
23 Pharmaceuticals is developing a novel CB1 antagonist, ANEB-001. The current project aims
24 to advance the development of ANEB-001, so that it can ultimately be approved as an acute
25 intervention for treatment of ACI and CHS in the emergency setting. The purpose of this
26 project is to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and therapeutic potential of an
27 intravenous formulation of ANEB-001 in relevant populations of patients, including pediatric
28 patients, who are particularly at-risk of serious adverse events. Ultimately, ANEB-001 could
29 become available to patients presenting to the emergency department with ACI or CHS,
30 decreasing the burden of these conditions on both patients and the US healthcare system."
10829770,"We are proposing BICX104, a subcutaneous, long-duration naltrexone implantable pellet, alone
or in conjunction with bupropion for the treatment of Methamphetamine Use Disorder (MUD).
Clinical studies have supported the potential use of naltrexone alone in the treatment of MUD, as
well as naltrexone in combination with bupropion to significantly attenuate methamphetamine
(METH) use. METH use is currently occurring in large numbers with an estimated 2 million people
per year in the U.S. and a 43% increase in usage from 2015-2019. Efficacy studies show that
compliance to NTX therapy is superior to placebo for maintaining abstinence to substance abuse,
with some evidence that monthly injections are superior to oral doses. However, noncompliance
severely limits NTX's clinical efficacy. The insertion of a sustained-release NTX depot pellet
formulation such as BICX104 can both ensure compliance and provide therapeutic blood levels
over long time periods. There are no approved medications for MUD, leaving patients, care givers,
and society at risk to the epidemic of METH abuse and associated morbidity and death. The
proposal investigates BICX104 alone and BICX104/BUP in comparison with a double placebo
group (implant and tablet) to demonstrate safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy in MUD.
There is an FDA-approved IND in place and a completed Phase 1 study of BICX104 as of March
22, 2023 to enable the trials described in this proposal. Dr. Mallon has assembled an outstanding
clinical research team paired with outstanding facilities that has a track record of success in this
program.
Aim 1: Determine the clinical safety profile of BICX104 in Methamphetamine Use Disorder
patients in Phase 1b exploratory studies. Evaluate the safety of BICX104 in the patient
population and the achievement of clinically relevant NTX plasma concentrations. Deliverables:
Achieve minimum effective concentration (MEC) of >1 ng/ml NTX plasma concentrations for at
least 10 weeks in all treatment groups. Demonstrate that at least one of the treatment arms is
sufficiently well tolerated to enable Phase 2 clinical trial.
Aim 2: Establish comparative efficacy of BICX104 and bupropion, alone and in
combination in decreasing clinical markers of methamphetamine abuse in
Methamphetamine Use Disorder patients. This Phase 2 trial tests efficacy in a sufficiently
powered population of MUD patients. Success in this Phase 2 will inform the design of a definitive
Phase 3 trial of efficacy that will enable drug approval. Deliverable: Safety and tolerability of at
least one treatment arm. Clinically meaningful efficacy of at least one treatment compared to
placebo. Milestone: Progression to Phase 3 efficacy trial to enable FDA approval."
10913534,"Project Summary
The long-term goal of our research program is to utilize new techniques and paradigms to understand the
molecular determinants of physiological and disease-relevant phenomena associated with intrinsically
disordered proteins (IDPs), or proteins that do not fold into stable structures in solution. Our focus is the self-
association of IDPs that occur on high-affinity surfaces (such as microtubules or organelle membranes). Surfaces
can promote self-association by increasing the local IDP concentration and templating IDP conformations more
susceptible to self-association. However, both IDPs and their respective high-affinity surfaces are subject to
numerous cellular modifications, dramatically expanding the experimental parameter space necessary to
precisely characterize this phenomenon. Understanding how self-association is controlled in this space could be
central to understanding their function in physiology and disease. Thus, our laboratory will adapt novel tools
beyond traditional molecular biology to recreate conditions in two model systems where this phenomenon
occurs: Tau condensation on microtubules and α-synuclein multimerization on synaptic vesicle membranes. Not
only does the PI have extensive expertise with biophysically characterizing these IDPs, but the importance of
Tau and α-synuclein to neurobiology and neurodegenerative disease provide a rich history of experimental
insights that can be applied towards this phenomenon. Combined, this expertise and background can be
incorporated into the phenomenon of surface-templated self-association of these IDPs. Furthermore, we will
establish protocols/methods that can be easily exported to study other IDPs that undergo surface-templated self-
association, as well. Overall, our intention by precisely understanding phenomena associated with select IDPs
is to create generalizable mechanisms by which other IDPs behave, eventually providing a rigorous framework
that has explanatory and predictive power for these proteins. By undertaking the proposed research, we hope to
transition our purely biophysics laboratory to an entirely multidisciplinary program that connects protein behavior
to cellular phenomenon."

The goal of this proposal is to characterize and quantify the impact of (a) sex, (b) gender-related exposures,
and (c) their interactions on heritable disease across the entire medical phenome. The growing availability of
large-scale biobanks with electronic health records (EHRs) linked to biospecimens has created a powerful, but
still relatively untapped, opportunity for research aimed at understanding the impact of sex and gender-related
exposures on human health. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) organized the
Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network which brought together investigators around
the U.S. to facilitate EHR-based genomic research and the implementation of genomic medicine. We have
created a new collaborative between two of the original eMERGE centers that leverages the resources and
existing infrastructure at each site including a combined total of over 9 million patient records and over 100,000
genotyped samples linked to EHRs. Large patient cohorts like the Vanderbilt and Northwestern populations are
critical resources that enable research on sex and gender-related exposures and their interaction at scale
across the clinical phenome. Our preliminary data demonstrates that sex and gender-related exposures
including socioeconomic position and sexual assualt trauma can be mined from the medical record. Moreover,
we show that these factors are significantly associated with ~30% of the medical phenome. Finally, we provide
evidence that sex and gender-related exposures also moderate genetic risk for complex disease. These
findings lead to our central hypothesis that sex and gender-associated exposures interact to modify
risk for heritable complex diseases. Building on this preliminary data, our first Aim is to identify and validate
the effects of sex and gender-related exposures across the clinical phenome. In Aim 2 we employ a genetic
epidemiology approach to identify sex-differences in the genetic architecture of 1,051 clinically utilized
laboratory tests. Finally, in Aim 3 we bring these two lines of inquiry together to test whether the clinical
manifestations of polygenic risk scores (PRS) are modified by sex and gender-related exposures. The
proposed research includes both quantitative and qualitative analyses aimed at investigating the genetic,
clinical, and psychosocial risk factors that contribute to the development of complex disease in extremely large
samples with phenome-wide data and linked genotypes. These sex-aware analyses can be thought of as
essential, but currently missing, pieces of the precision approach to medicine."
10911909,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Patients with congenital immunodeficiencies, such as combined immunodeficiencies (CID) with partial
recombinase activating gene (RAG) deficiency (pRD) are highly vulnerable to chronic infections and refractory
autoimmune disorders. RAG1/2 are key to creating and censoring the B cell receptor diversity. In case of pRD,
developing B cells that are naturally autoreactive may remain reactive to self in the periphery and be unable to
mount efficient antibody responses. This results in chronic antigen exposure that can activate T and B cells.
We propose to focus on two specific cell populations: hyperactive T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and innate-like
extrafollicular polyreactive B cells, as markers of autoimmunity. The latter resemble age-associated B cells
(ABCs), which accumulate with infections and with age. Normally, ABCs are highly sensitive to innate immune
stimulation by microbes and inflammatory cytokines and play a key role in controlling viral infections by
producing protective antibodies. After the infection resolves, ABC numbers contract markedly. However, with
chronic infections, ABCs or ABC-like cells expand, persist and produce antibodies that are less protective
against microbes and more reactive to self, especially in individuals with particular genetic immunodeficiencies.
Sustained expansion of polyreactive ABCs parallels microbial/antigen load (toll-like receptor stimulation) and
expansion of Tfh cells, which secrete the inflammatory cytokines, interferon gamma (IFNand interleukin 21
(IL-21). It is unclear which stimuli and cell signaling pathways are dominant in promoting ABC autoreactivity in
pRD or other CID s. Our long-term goal is to understand how autoreactive ABCs emerge in CID in order to
develop effective immune modulatory treatments. We hypothesize that the susceptibility to infections of
patients with pRD results in increased, continual microbial/antigen presence and chronic low-grade
inflammation throughout the body. In response, Tfh cells secrete inflammatory cytokines abundantly (IFNand
IL-21), which together with chronic microbial stimulation induces ABC-like cells to expand and become
autoantibody-secreting cells and present autoantigens to Tfh cells, which sustains them. Thus, ABC-like cell
abundance and autoreactivity is perpetuated in pRD. Our specific aims are to 1) identify likely drivers of ABC-
like cells in pRD patients and 2) dissect mechanisms contributing to ABC-like cell generation and persistence
using pRD mouse models. Our innovative research strategies include studying an international cohort of pRD
patients in parallel with using novel mouse models, exposing mice to varying levels of microbes, and
correlating gene expression changes with ABC developmental characteristics and autoimmune severity of
patients. Our proposed study is significant because it will likely illuminate how dysfunctional ABC-like cells
develop in persons susceptible to chronic infections and lead to therapies that modify specific B cell signaling
pathways to improve humoral immunity and reduce autoimmunity in pRD and other CID."
10911162,"This MIRA proposal presents my vision for how my research will evolve over the next five years and
culminates from our long-term, rigorous studies of the diverse structures and properties of supercoiled DNA
and its interaction with topoisomerases. Within cells, DNA is supercoiled and often constrained into small DNA
loops that can be experimentally recapitulated with supercoiled DNA minicircles small enough for use in a wide
range of biophysical and biochemical assays. The methods we have developed and extensive knowledge
acquired thus far will be invaluable for our proposed studies of DNA topoisomerases, actions of important
antimicrobial and anticancer agents that target them, the utility of engineered DNA minicircles as gene therapy
vectors, and supercoiling-induced noncanonical DNA structures that are implicated in human disease. We will
first utilize state-of-the-art electron cryo-microscopy and cryo-tomography to determine the 3-D structure of
topoisomerases bound to physiologically relevant DNA substrates. This approach will be coupled with
comprehensive quantitative assays using electrophoretic and fluorescence techniques and analytical
ultracentrifugation to characterize how DNA supercoiling so strongly affects topoisomerase-drug interactions.
Many topoisomerases, particularly those that are important drug targets, preferentially act on positively
supercoiled DNA. Consequently, corresponding anti-topoisomerase drugs interact with positively supercoiled
DNA as well, although research of chemotherapeutics that target topoisomerases has largely disregarded the
effect of supercoiled DNA on drug action. We plan to identify new inhibitors of validated drug targets by
screening, for the first time, active topoisomerase bound to positively supercoiled DNA against a library of over
5 billion diverse compounds. We will next apply our innovative tools and compelling data of how supercoiling,
curvature, and sequence dictate DNA conformation to design and construct DNA nanoparticles with specific,
desired shapes that are ideal for cellular uptake needed in a variety of clinical applications. Existing
nanoparticles, such as those composed of gold or monosaccharides, are inert; therefore, we propose utilizing
DNA minicircles, as both the vehicle and cargo in one, for gene therapy to overcome many of the barriers to
effective gene delivery. Finally, we will employ DNA minicircles to investigate how supercoiling promotes the
formation of non-B-DNA structures, which are known to impact DNA replication, repair, transcription, yet their
in vivo frequency is controversial. This work is transformative, as our novel DNA minicircles, advanced imaging
tools, and quantitative analyses will enable us to achieve unprecedented and previously unattainable insights
into the structure and function of supercoiled DNA. Our fundamental research will continue to challenge the
paradigm that DNA is passively acted upon by topoisomerases but instead drives numerous critical cellular
processes. Moreover, this project has substantial human therapeutic applications related to anti-topoisomerase
drug efficacy, improved gene therapy delivery, and mitigating genomic instability caused by non-B-DNA forms."
10919240,"Gastric cancer (GC), specifically gastric adenocarcinoma, is the fifth most common cancer and the third
leading cause of cancer death globally and has been categorized as a neglected cancer by the World Health
Organization. In the U.S., there are stark disparities, with Blacks, Hispanics and Asians having a nearly two-
fold greater risk of developing or dying from GC compared to Whites, reflecting differences in risk factors, such
as Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and smoking, as well as access to primary prevention and care.
Several factors are changing the landscape of GC prevention, including a better understanding of the disease
natural history, new evidence on prevention from prospective studies, and anticipated results from randomized
controlled trials. As early GC detection can improve survival by allowing for curative surgical or noninvasive
endoscopic resection, new targeted approaches to GC prevention have the potential to markedly improve
population health and reduce GC disparities within the U.S. Although H. pylori has been the primary focus of
global GC prevention efforts to date, substantial variation by subpopulation in H. pylori prevalence in the U.S.
and the world has accentuated the need to optimize H. pylori screen-and-treat interventions for vulnerable
groups. One approach is targeted endoscopic screening of high-risk individuals. For instance, persons found to
have gastric intestinal metaplasia, a precursor lesion associated with a high progression risk to gastric
neoplasia, are recommended to undergo endoscopic surveillance in many countries. A critical need exists to
identify effective and cost-effective strategies to address these clinical challenges in the U.S., as well
as globally. This proposed work builds upon prior GC work spanning GC and H. pylori simulation modeling
studies, GC secondary database analyses, and relevant methodologic and global cancer modeling
publications. The research team for this proposal has a vast collective experience in simulation and
comparative modeling for cancer control, clinical expertise across the spectrum of GC prevention and care,
and a demonstrated track record and commitment to informing cancer care and policy. The proposed three
modeling groups are well-positioned to perform and successfully complete the highly relevant project aims.
The overarching goal of the proposed research is to produce innovative and paradigm-shifting
changes to cancer care through a disparities-focused modeling approach targeting the most
vulnerable, high-risk populations that bear the greatest burden of GC in the US, and the world. We will
accomplish this goal by performing comparative modeling and completing the following aims: 1) Develop GC
simulation models to estimate GC outcomes for subgroups by race and ethnicity in the U.S.; 2) Assess the
impact of risk factor trends and primary prevention strategies on GC disparities; 3) Evaluate targeted
secondary prevention strategies for reducing early onset-related mortality and GC disparities, and 4) Adapt the
models to evaluate GC prevention policies in the global setting."
10906249,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Identifying ways to delay or prevent cognitive decline and dementia remains a priority of the NIA. As part of this
work, there is growing recognition that social participation and community connectedness may reduce the risk
of these diseases. Unfortunately, this research has provided little specificity into how various social activities
may differentially predict cognitive decline. There has also been little inquiry into how older adult social
participation or its relationship with cognition might differ by gender.
Unlike many standard survey items (e.g., health, education), there is insufficient consistency with how social
participation is measured in social surveys and utilized in empirical research. In particular, the use of social
participation “summary measures” (a) may obscure differential associations between cognition and underlying
social activities, and (b) often include items that are, arguably, not “social participation” (e.g., meeting with
family members). This has resulted in two limitations: One, it is not known which social activities—and to what
extent these activities—are driving any associations. Two, it is difficult to compare results among similar
studies, raising concerns about validity and reliability.
This project has three aims. One, we will investigate how associations between social participation and older
adult cognitive functioning differ by social activity. Two, we will identify mechanisms that link particular social
activities to cognitive health. Three, we will investigate to what extent associations between social participation
and older adult cognitive functioning differ by gender. To accomplish these goals, we will utilize four large
nationally representative longitudinal studies of older adults.
Dr. Eric Vogelsang, PI, has an established publication record of older adult social participation and health
research. The collaborators on this project have extensive experience in cognitive functioning research,
mentoring, and NIH grants. Working at a “Super” Hispanic Serving Institution (CSU-San Bernardino), the
project will provide research experience to students with limited opportunities.
The proposed study will produce three benefits. One, it will inform patients, practitioners, and policy makers
looking to delay or prevent the onset of cognitive decline. Two, it will bring recognition to the health implications
of gender inequality in older adult social activity. Three, we expect this work to motivate standardization of
“social participation” measures in social surveys."

 The proposed five-year plan for Dr. Luz Garcini's K01 Mentor Career Development Award will help launch
her independent research career in biobehavioral health disparities and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. In
the proposed project, Dr. Garcini aims at filling a gap in the literature by understanding how bereavement
increases CVD risk, including detecting relevant ethnic disparities and identifying protective factors during this
difficult life transition. The proposed training and mentoring plan will supplement Dr. Garcini's expertise in
health disparities and community-based research with a foundation in CVD and psychoneuroimmunology (PNI)
at premiere academic and medical institutions under the mentorship of renowned experts.
 The proposed research will use data from a longitudinal study among 96 recently (<2 months) bereaved
adults (50% Latino, 50% Non-Latino White) with CVD risk assessments (i.e., glucocorticoid (GC) resistance
and inflammation) done at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months post enrollment. Survey measures of relevant
mediators and moderators will take place at each time point, with a qualitative interview done after the last visit.
The proposed project will draw on Dr. Garcini's expertise, along with a mentoring team at the forefront of
biomedical science, to conduct the following aims using an interdisciplinary and culturally sensitive approach.
AIM 1. To assess ethnic differences (Latinos, non-Latino Whites) in the association between grief
symptoms and CVD risk (GC resistance and inflammation) among bereaved adults cross-sectionally
and longitudinally. Hypothesis 1. The strength of the association between grief symptoms and CVD risk
will be relatively stronger among Latinos compared to Non-Latino Whites.
AIM 2. To identify contextual and cultural factors that facilitate coping with bereavement among
Latinos and non-Latino Whites.
AIM 3. To supplement Dr. Garcini's expertise in community-based research and health disparities
with a foundation in CVD and psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) at premiere institutions and under the
mentorship of renowned experts with the goal of increasing faculty diversity in the biomedical
sciences. The proposed studies will offer an invaluable context to apply these concepts in a meaningful
way—integrating didactics and experience, with the mentorship of an advising team of experts.
 The proposed research will provide novel information about mechanisms and predictors that underlie CVD
risk in a vulnerable population about which little is known, while also identifying protective factors that foster
resilience. The longitudinal design will provide valuable information to identify critical time points for
intervention. The interdisciplinary training plan will equip Dr. Garcini with extensive knowledge of CVD and PNI
skills to devote her career to the study of biobehavioral health disparities, CVD risk, and social determinants of
health, which is needed to inform the development of interventions aimed at reducing disease burden."
10703755,"Suppression of reward-seeking behaviors is critical for survival, yet chronic opioid use and relapse
commonly occur despite known social, economic, and health consequences among Veterans suffering from
opioid use disorder (OUD). Thus, defining how opioid use influences the neuronal systems responsible for
suppressing reward-motivated behaviors is critical for understanding the etiology of OUD. Despite this
knowledge, no studies to date have tracked activity in single neurons from initial opioid use to dependence,
limiting our understanding of how brain circuits responsible for suppressing maladaptive behavioral actions are
modulated to unleash excessive opioid seeking and consumption. My lab has overcome this issue by developing
a novel mouse behavioral assay that allows longitudinal tracking of activity in precisely defined neuronal circuit
elements across heroin self-administration, extinction, and reinstatement. Using this paradigm, I will test the
hypothesis that a thalamoaccumbal to parvalbumin interneuron circuit is weakened by opioid use to causally
disinhibit opioid self-administration and relapse to opioid seeking.
 Recent work in my laboratory, as well as the work of others, reveals that neurons in the posterior
paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (pPVT) provide a critical ‘brake’ that suppresses inappropriate reward-
motivated behaviors through the activation of downstream nucleus accumbens (NAc) parvalbumin interneurons
(PV-INs). Despite the demonstrated role of this pPVT→NAcPV-IN circuit for suppression of reward seeking; the
activity, physiology, and function of this circuit for controlling opioid-seeking behaviors remains unclear. Based
on extensive preliminary findings, here I will test the overarching hypothesis that heroin self-administration
reduces pPVT→NAcPV-IN circuit activity and connectivity, causally disinhibiting heroin use and relapse to heroin
seeking. I will test independent components of this hypothesis through the completion of 3 independent Aims. In
Aim 1, I will use two-photon calcium imaging to measure the activity dynamics of pPVT→NAc axons and
downstream NAc PV-INs across heroin self-administration, extinction, and reinstatement. In Aim 2, I will use
slice patch-clamp electrophysiology to characterize synaptic adaptations within pPVT→NAcPV-IN circuits caused
by heroin self-administration. Finally, in Aim 3 I will use optogenetic and chemogenetic strategies to determine
the necessity and sufficiency of pPVT→NAcPV-IN circuit dynamics for heroin self-administration and relapse to
heroin seeking. Overall, I investigate how a principle, but understudied, behavioral suppression circuit is modified
by opioid use to unleash maladaptive opioid-seeking behaviors. Our preliminary findings suggest that this project
will be highly impactful for the field and could inform circuit-based therapeutics that normalize neuronal activity
for treatment of Veterans suffering from OUD."

Blood CD8+ T cells can be subdivided into different subsets based on their cytokine section profiles and
functions. We have shown that IL-9-secreting CD8+ Tc9 cells mediate a stronger antitumor effect in vivo
compared to the classical IFN--secreting Tc1 or CTLs. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.
Recently, we discovered that Tc9 cells could eradicate large-established tumors by inducing an enhanced
tumor pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death dependent on caspase-1 activation. Our preliminary studies
showed that Tc9 cell-treated tumors had increased expressions of IL-1 and IL-18 and activated caspase-1,
and more tumor cell death compared to Tc1-treated tumors. Neutralizing IL-1 and IL-18 in vivo completely
abrogated the therapeutic advantage of Tc9 cells over Tc1 cells in tumor controls. We further showed that
tumor-specific Tc9 cells killed tumor cells by inducing both caspase-1-depedent pyroptosis and caspase-3-
dependent apoptosis while Tc1 cells mainly induced apoptosis in tumor cells. Similarly, human tumor-specific
Tc9 cells also displayed stronger antitumor effects in vivo compared to Tc1 cells, which was IL-1- and IL-18-
dependent. Interestingly, we observed that IL-1 plus IL-18 induced apoptosis in cultured Tc1 but not Tc9 cells,
Tc9 cell-derived IL-9 is critical for Tc9 cell activation of STAT3 and pro-growth and survival signaling and
function, and IL-1 plus IL-18 can re-activate STAT3 and pro-growth and survival signaling in aged Tc9 cells
with reduced IL-9 production. Thus, these findings reveal novel mechanisms underlying how Tc9 cells
overcome the suppressive tumor microenvironment after transfer, survive and persist longer, and exert a
greater antitumor activity as compared to the traditional Tc1 cells. We hypothesize that tumor-specific Tc9
subset may be superb effector T cells for cancer immunotherapy due to their capacity to induce both
pyroptosis and apoptosis in tumor cells and utilize Tc9 cell-secreted IL-9 and tumor-produced IL-1 and IL-18
for their fitness, longevity, and function in vivo to effectively eradicate large established tumors. To test our
hypothesis, Aim 1 will determine the importance and mechanisms of Tc9 cell-induced tumor cell pyroptosis in
tumor clearance via IL-9- and GrzB-induced NFB-NLRP3-caspase-1-gasdermin activation, and Aim 2 will
determine the role and mechanisms underlying Tc9 cell persistence and function mediated by Tc9 cell-
secreted IL-9 and tumor-produced IL-1 and IL-18. Completing this project will reveal the importance and
mechanism in induction of tumor pyroptosis by tumor-specific Tc9 cells and elucidate the mechanisms
underlying the longevity and function of Tc9 cells in tumor microenvironment."

ABSTRACT (PROJECT 4)
Aggressive prostate cancers (PC) exhibit phenotypic changes through a poorly-understood process termed
“lineage plasticity (LP).” LP typically occurs as a result of secondary resistance to androgen receptor signaling
inhibitor (ARSI) therapy and is identified by variant histology and emergence of stemness, neuroendocrine (NE)
and epithelial-mesenchymal transition features. LP can be a driver of genome and chromosome instability (CIN).
In the previous P01 cycle we were the first to report that the transcription factor ONECUT2 (OC2/HNF6β) is a
master regulator that specifies an NE transcriptional program in certain castration-resistant prostate cancers
(CRPC). OC2 suppresses androgen receptor (AR) target genes and acts as a survival factor. We developed a
novel class of small molecule OC2 inhibitors that inhibit growth and metastasis of AR-V7-positive mCRPC
xenografts. OC2 is thus a previously unknown driver of LP in aggressive PC that can be targeted with a drug-
like compound. Evidence from genetically engineered mouse models and tissue regeneration models
demonstrate that OC2 is upregulated under conditions that produce CIN. In the previous funding cycle we used
model systems, genomics data, and studies of human PC tissues and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) to assemble
evidence that CIN, OC2 activation, and nuclear shape instability (NSI) are shared features of both treatment-
naïve de novo metastatic PC and mCRPC. These findings suggest these are inherent to one or more aggressive
PC classes and may even occur in the absence of selection from ARSI. Using these observations as a scientific
premise, we hypothesize that OC2, CIN, and NSI act coordinately to drive LP and PC lethality. The Specific
Aims are: Aim 1. Determine the role of CIN in OC2-driven lineage plasticity. OC2 will be enforced in vivo in
human PC tissue regeneration assays to determine whether OC2 activity is dependent on CIN and whether OC2
promotes LP, CIN or NSI. Graft tissues from intact and castrated mice will be analyzed for CIN, LP, and NSI
using histologic, immunohistochemical, RNA expression profiling and bioinformatics methods. LP will be induced
in human mCRPC 2D and 3D human models by hypoxia and bone marrow stromal secretions to determine
whether these stimuli promote NSI and CIN. Aim 2. Identify mechanisms of NSI that promote lineage plasticity.
Tissue regeneration assays will be used to determine whether NSI induced by silencing the nuclear membrane
protein emerin (EMD) promotes CIN, LP, and OC2 activation. We will determine whether EMD silencing can
elicit or cooperate with CIN to drive tumor growth, LP and castration resistance. Aim 3. Investigate OC2
activation, CIN and NSI in parallel across primary and metastatic tumor cell populations. An established single
cell analysis approach will be used to determine whether CIN, NSI and OC2 activation co-exist in human PC
cells isolated from de novo metastatic and mCRPC cases.

Rising antibiotic resistance in N. gonorrhoeae poses a serious, global public health threat.
Effective control of N. gonorrhoeae is hampered by asymptomatic infections that allow
transmission of the bacteria to uninfected individuals and immune evasion by the bacteria that

infection and the immunologic responses that are responsible for clearance of infection. We
propose a longitudinal study with close surveillance and of follow up individuals with recent N.
gonorrhoeae infection who are at high risk for re-infection. This study will provide a rich data
set to understand pathogen exposure and infection outcome. It will also provide a set of biologic
specimens to study the pathogen and host factors that contribute to infection clearance as well
as asymptomatic carriage and/or progression to symptomatic infection. We will conduct
analysis of anti-N. gonorrhoeae antibody and cellular immune responses to inform correlates of

The Cellular Senescence Network Consortium (SenNet) presents unique new requirements and opportunities
for organization and data coordination relative to the rapidly growing community of single-cell genomics mapping
consortia including the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program Consortium (HuBMAP), the Human Cell Atlas (HCA)
and the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN). In particular, SenNet focuses on discovery, induction, and
mapping of specific physiology at the cellular and molecular level, under a variety of normal,
experimental and disease conditions, not “just” a catalog of normal, murine, or cancer tissues. This
substantially increases the value of engagement and collaboration among the teams that constitute
SenNet. Specifically, investigators among the Consortium Organization and Data Coordination Center
(CODCC), Tissue Management Centers (TMCs), and Technology Development (TTDs), as well as the broader
community of Cellular Senescence (CS) scientists and innovators, will need to work together to common purpose
to achieve a multiyear strategy of human impact. SenNet will also need senescent cells to cooperate to reveal
their biology. These are an understudied set of cells and phenotypes that are fluid in many ways we do not yet
understand, but yet may have profound impact on our ability to address a variety of conditions with tremendous
burden of disease across organ systems (e.g. neurological deterioration, cancer control, and even aging).
SenNet, distinct from other single-cell genomics consortia, will need more shared focus upon prioritizing
experiments jointly performed and/or replicated among laboratories, prioritizing tight focus on specific cells,
and addressing changes, pathways, and trajectories cells may take over time. SenNet will ultimately require
changing the conception of single-cell -omics maps to include dynamics in time, space and function, and will
feed these back onto the other efforts."
10912674,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The broad goals of this research proposal are to understand how cells mitigate the aggregation
of proteins that underlie neurodegenerative diseases, and how these mechanisms are influenced by
stress pathways and organelle trafficking. There are no cures for Huntington’s, Parkinson’s, and
Alzheimer’s diseases, so exploring new mechanisms for how cells respond to protein aggregation is
important for offering new therapeutic approaches. The first goal of this proposal is to understand how
cells degrade the disease-causing form of the Huntington protein, in particular as it misfolds but before
it forms the large aggregates that are found in the brains of patients. These intermediate, oligomeric
forms of the Huntington protein are thought to be the most toxic, yet we do not know the mechanisms
through which cells most effectively degrade them. Guided by preliminary data, we will explore how
cells employ late endosome-mediated microautophagy in this degradation. Microautophagy is not well-
understood at a mechanistic level, especially in mammalian cells, and this proposal is also designed to
provide more general insights and tools to study this fundamental cellular process. The second overall
goal of this proposal is to understand the relationships between protein aggregation, stress in the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and organelle trafficking/positioning. Many neurodegenerative diseases
induce ER stress, yet the complicated interplay between ER stress response pathways and
neurodegeneration is not well-understood enough to provide a clear path for manipulating these stress
pathways therapeutically. This proposal seeks to understand how a particular aspect of the ER stress
response, involving the degradation of a specific mRNA and subsequent repositioning of late
endosomes and lysosomes, affects the degradation and aggregation of the Huntington protein.
Investigating this stress response will also help us to understand how cells maintain homeostasis in the
ER, which is important in many human diseases including cancer and diabetes."
10933423,"SUMMARY CURATION
Mining Information from Echinoderm Genomes and the Scientific Literature
Echinoderms (sea urchins and their allies) are valuable models for analysis of the genomic control of
embryonic development. For example, the most complete gene regulatory networks (GRNs) for development
that we have for any animal have recently been solved for sea urchin embryos. Comparative studies across
echinoderms are elucidating the evolution of gene regulatory programs. Data on genes, genomes, and gene
expression are fundamental to all aspects of modern developmental biological research. Effective access to
these data has become vital not only to members of the echinoderm research community but to a broader
audience studying developmental processes in many model systems. The activities of Echinobase are
essential in order to ultimately apply this scientific information to human development and disease.
Model organism databases enhance the value of research by consolidating and storing data, integrating
different types of information and representing it in useful ways, and linking similar kinds of data across
organisms. Echinobase was created to enhance the value of scientific data related to the genes and genomes
of sea urchins and other echinoderms and to serve as a centralized, definitive resource for information related
to these important model organisms. The Curate Component (Curate) plays a central role in the overall
mission of Echinobase by identifying, extracting, and organizing scientific data. All of our curation efforts are
supported through a close collaboration with Xenbase, which provides a suite of data entry, storage, and
analysis tools that are well-suited to our needs.
During this project period, Curate has three major goals: 1) to curate echinoderm genomes, including the
provision of accurate, orthology-based names to echinoderm genes and the improved annotation of current
echinoderm gene models; 2) to curate an extensive scientific literature related to echinoderm development,
including the ongoing assembly of a bibliography of published papers that serves as a backbone to which all
curated biological data are attributed, and the curation of a wealth of information from these papers related to
gene expression patterns, morpholinos, antibodies, guide RNAs (gRNAs), and cis-regulatory elements (CREs);
3) to enhance the current echinoderm developmental ontology, which provides a foundation for almost all of
our curation efforts, by expanding the ontology to include representatives of additional classes of echinoderms
and additional life history stages and by incorporating into Echinobase additional static content derived from
the developmental ontology. By achieving these goals, Curate will vastly enhance the utility of Echinobase to
the community of researchers who study echinoderm development and ensure that echinoderm-related
information is readily accessible to biologists who work with other model organisms, including vertebrates."
10933428,"SUMMARY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT
Software Development to Enhance Echinobase
The Technical Development component describes software development for Echinobase. This includes code in
the database, web applications, user and curator interfaces. New data types and new curation efforts require
new systems, tools and software interfaces to be built. Importantly, interfaces must be designed to allow our
community members to browse and interrogate the data via our web portal. We have recently added many new
content types and features to Echinobase, including multi-species support, Gene, Literature and Community
pages; and there are many additional types of content that will require support from the technical development
team, including the GEO pipeline, single-cell omics, ortholog GO terms, tools to integrate paralog gene data
and more. As many of the biologists generating and accessing these data are not bioinformaticians, we need
to develop tools and interfaces that are intuitive and easy to use. An excellent example of how we plan to
achieve this goal is the Xenbase GEO module that we will implement in Echinobase, that allows non-experts to
view, interact with, and understand RNA-seq data through a simple, intuitive and interactive web interface.
Over the next five years, we will proceed through numerous steps for each new type of data we aim to support:
assessing data requirements, data modeling, middleware software development, testing and optimization of
trial releases, developing curator, user and data browsing interfaces. Prioritization of projects is done in
consultation with the echinoderm research community via annual surveys and workshops at conferences, input
from our scientific advisory board and collaborators, and, in the future, in consultation with the Alliance of
Genome Resources (AGR) workgroups and other external resources such as the NCBI and UCSC. Planned
new projects include ATAC-seq data from GEO, paralog data from DIOPT, single-cell RNA-seq, support for
genome wide CRE predictions, and computed expression phenotypes. Technical Development will also
support our increased use of machine learning as applied to Echinobase literature and content curation.
Aim 1. Support expanded and novel content.
Aim 2. Generate custom content and support variants and single-cell datasets.
Aim 3. Interface with external resources."
10705451,"Background: There is currently a severe dearth of safe, non-habit forming pharmacological interventions for
chronic pain disorders, and the clinical need to develop efficacious new therapeutics has never been more
urgent. Fueled by the worsening opioid crisis and further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, opioid and
other drug overdose deaths have climbed to staggeringly high levels. The rapid development of
pharmacological agents for the management of chronic pain conditions that are safe, well-tolerated, efficacious
and non-addicting is thus of paramount importance. Neurosteroids are naturally occurring molecules that are
enriched in human brain and potentially ideal candidates for the safe and effective treatment of pain. The
proposed project is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled adaptive design study to determine the
safety and efficacy of two promising neurosteroid molecules for the treatment of chronic low back pain in
Veterans. The project logically builds upon the findings from our prior randomized clinical trial (RCT)
demonstrating that the highest dose of pregnenolone (500mg/day) significantly improves chronic low back pain
(Naylor et al., 2020), while also suggesting that higher doses of this molecule a may be even more efficacious.
A second neurosteroid molecule, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) has also been implicated in the
pathophysiology of pain. DHEA levels are inversely associated with pain and our preliminary data demonstrate
that 8-weeks of DHEA treatment is well-tolerated and reduces pain symptoms. Our strong biomarker and
clinical data suggest that both pregnenolone and DHEA appear to have great therapeutic potential for the
treatment of chronic pain conditions. We will thus investigate if these molecules exhibit possible efficacy in low
back pain and determine maximally well-tolerated doses that are safe and optimally efficacious in the proposed
three-arm trial (pregnenolone, DHEA, placebo).
Methods: The proposed project is a Phase II randomized clinical trial utilizing an adaptive design to determine
the safety and efficacy of pregnenolone and DHEA for the treatment of chronic low back pain in Veterans.
Participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 4 weeks of treatment with pregnenolone, DHEA or matching
placebo (N=108, approximately 36 per group). Pregnenolone dosing will begin at 500mg/day and escalate
every week by 500mg as tolerated (to a potential maximum dose 2000mg/day). DHEA dosing will begin at
100mg/day and increase weekly by 100mg/day (to a potential maximum dose 400mg/day). The primary
endpoint will be post-treatment change scores in mean daily pain intensity ratings (numerical rating scale, 0-
10). Secondary endpoint will be changes in pain interference measures (Brief Pain Inventory). Safety will be
thoroughly monitored throughout study participation (SAEs, AEs, clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs,
ECG). Neurosteroid quantifications will be conducted by highly sensitive state-of-the-art and specific mass
spectrometry to investigate baseline and post-treatment neurosteroid levels as biomarker predictors of
therapeutic response, and to determine optimal therapeutic ranges for these neurosteroid interventions.
Conclusion: Chronic pain symptoms profoundly influence quality of life and function in a very large number of
Veterans, and efficacious new treatments that are safe, well-tolerated, and non-habit forming are urgently
needed. Compelling preclinical and clinical data support the possibility that neurosteroids such as
pregnenolone and DHEA may be extremely promising treatments for pain conditions. The proposed RCT
would thus provide pivotal evidence to optimize neurosteroid dosing in pain disorders and could rapidly
translated into Phase 3 clinical trials. Findings from the proposed clinical trial efforts could thus lead to a
potential therapeutic breakthrough for chronic pain conditions."
10708519,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (OVERALL)
The United States has been experiencing a national crisis around escalating rates of substance use and un-
healthy behavior patterns in rural communities. The nature and challenge of substance misuse in community
and rural settings continues to change rapidly, evolving in reaction to myriad forces. The causes and conse-
quences of drug use are complex. They range from molecular to cultural and are usually studied in isolation even
though they are interconnected. The unique mission of the Rural Drug Addiction Research (RDAR) Center
is to apply complementary approaches across disciplines to better understand the factors associated with sub-
stance use and identify new avenues to address this critical public heath challenge. In Phase 1, RDAR brought
together basic and applied scientists from neuroscience, cognition, simulation, epidemiology, psychology, and
sociology to address the etiology, assessment, prevention, and treatment of substance use. Center projects
range from synapse to society—from the microscopic world of biology to social and geographical environments—
to understand drug use in the Great Plains. In Phase 2, RDAR will extend its successful infrastructure and prac-
tices to support a cadre of researchers that integrate multiple disciplines to enable promising early-stage inves-
tigators to achieve research independence. The Center will support Project Leaders’ scientific growth and career
development (Aim 1) and foster interdisciplinary research to investigate substance use (Aim 2) in Nebraska, the
Great Plains, and surrounding regions. RDAR will draw on an internal Mentoring, Engagement, and Outreach
Workgroup of 15 senior researchers providing dedicated mentoring and technical expertise. A 5-member Advi-
sory Committee will guide the Center as leadership builds and strengthens the investigator pipeline through
institutionally committed strategic hires, recruitment efforts across colleges and departments, institutional Pilot
Project support, and collaborations with existing research centers and service units. Coupled with existing and
new institutional commitments such as indirect recapture, pilot project funding, new tenure-track hires, and ren-
ovated space, RDAR will enhance the success of investigators competing for external funding and increase the
Center’s thematic footprint regarding basic, clinical, translational, and community research. These successes
will position the Center to leverage Phase 2 funding and institutional commitments from a nationally recognized
research university (University of Nebraska-Lincoln) and a university-based medical center (University of Ne-
braska Medical Center) to increase RDAR’s scope of research and the reach of findings. Working with commu-
nity, university, and IDeA-state partners, RDAR will engage with clinical, community health, and policy sectors
to address substance use challenges in rural and underserved populations. These strategies will set the stage
for national, evidence-based impact on this critical health issue, support the translation of research into inter-
vention, enhance the foundation for long-term Center sustainability, and propel RDAR toward achieving funding
as a NIDA/NIAAA-supported P01/P30/P50 research center."
10708520,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (ADMINISTRATIVE CORE)
The nature and challenge of rural drug use/misuse in the United States requires an approach that works across
a continuum of health science domains. By bringing together researchers from neuroscience, cognition, simula-
tion, epidemiology, psychology, and sociology to address the etiology, assessment, prevention, and treatment
of substance use/misuse, the Rural Drug Addiction Research (RDAR) Center applies complementary ap-
proaches across a variety of disciplines. The Center supports research to better understand the critical public
health challenges posed by substance use in community and rural settings and identify new avenues to address
substance use problems. RDAR projects range from the microscopic world of biology to the social and geo-
graphical environments in which substance use takes place. The goal of the Administrative Core in Phase 2
is to continue to provide the overall coordination and administrative infrastructure that will enable RDAR to con-
tinue growing the biomedical expertise and approaches needed to understand the causes and consequences of
substance use. Toward this end, the Administrative Core will implement a faculty development plan to hire,
recruit, and mentor Project Leaders to accelerate their transition to independence (Aim 1). It will also create
synergy among Project Leaders and Center members by facilitating the use of RDAR resources to successfully
submit, secure, and implement federal funding (Aim 2). The Administrative Core will expand access to the Lon-
gitudinal Networks Core (RDAR’s Research Core) by seeding innovative Pilot Projects, building collaborative
teams, cultivating grant development skills, assisting in pre- and post-awards functions, supporting budget and
compliance needs, and enhancing opportunities to participate in outreach and engagement activities. The Ad-
ministrative Core will support Center-affiliated research projects and provide programmatic enhancement and
engagement opportunities to realize the Center’s vision and goals related to substance use, misuse, and related
health disparities (Aim 3). Finally, the Administrative Core will implement a systematic evaluation of measurable
goals and milestones to refine the Center’s vision and enable long-term sustainability (Aim 4). By accomplishing
these Aims, the Administrative Core will support Center goals of expanding the scientific growth and career
development of RDAR investigators and fostering interdisciplinary research to investigate the causes and con-
sequences of substance use. By linking cohort-based longitudinal data collection with neuroscience, cognition,
simulation, epidemiology, psychology, and sociology, RDAR will continue to magnify its reach and contribute a
unique regional, rural, and research focus to the national Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE)
portfolio. The Administrative Core will support these efforts and propel RDAR forward as a growing COBRE,
enhancing the success of Center members and further contributing to the overall research environment at the
University of Nebraska and across RDAR’s IDeA-program partners in Nebraska and beyond."

The long-term goal of the Longitudinal Networks Core (LNC) is to serve as a sustainable resource for the Rural
Drug Addiction Research (RDAR) Center, the University of Nebraska, and other academic researchers to inves-

public health challenge. The LNC was designed to meet a pressing need for cost-effective access to long-term
recruitment and retention services capable of maintaining a study cohort and to provide expertise in community-
engaged approaches and network designs. In Phase 1, the LNC supported researchers from a wide range of
disciplines and created the critical infrastructure for managing projects, data, and software use. The goal of the
LNC in Phase 2 will be to maintain and extend: 1) access to a longitudinal cohort of people who use drugs from
which to recruit study participants; 2) data describing factors affecting regional patterns of substance use; 3) use
of LNC software to collect responsive fine-grained data from participants; 4) support for network sampling or
analytic approaches; and 5) consultation in community-engaged research, field-based biospecimen testing, ep-
idemiological data collection, respondent driven sampling, intervention design, and research with hard-to-reach
populations. By offering resources and expertise that do not otherwise exist in the region and would be prohibi-
tively expensive for early-stage investigators, the LNC will achieve its vision of increasing substance use/misuse
research by elevating research capacity throughout Nebraska. The RDAR Center’s strong collaborations with
university-wide research centers, campuses across the University of Nebraska system, and statewide and na-
tional IDeA-program partners will be leveraged to expand services and the user base in Phase 2. Towards this
end, the LNC will establish, maintain, and expand the Core’s active regional longitudinal cohort of people who
use drugs (Aim 1). In doing so, the LNC will provide researchers access to a Participant Pool for recruitment
into affiliated projects such as context-sensitive samples for biological and epidemiological research and inter-
vention trials and secondary data for novel network approaches to understanding regional patterns of substance
use. The LNC will also expand the user base of LNC services (Aim 2) by leveraging the Phase 1 success of
software platforms developed by the LNC to enable innovative research in community settings. LNC services
will facilitate the transition of early-stage investigators to independence, the development of interdisciplinary
teams, and the successful pursuit of large external funding within RDAR’s thematic focus. These endeavors, in
turn, will grow an already impressive concentration of expertise for substance use and related health disparities
research and cultivate collaborations nationally through existing IDeA-state partners and connections. These
efforts will position the LNC for independence and sustainability and as a national leader, contributing a unique
regional, rural, and research focus to NIH’s Center of Biomedical Research Excellence portfolio."
10739308,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders are highly heritable and debilitating brain diseases that together
affect nearly fifty million Americans, caused by the complex interaction of genetic and environmental risk factors.
Although genomic studies indicate that much of disease risk reflects the aggregate impact of hundreds of genetic
variants, to date, a substantial proportion of both the heritable and environmental components remain
unexplained. A major challenge in the field has been illuminating the pathways connecting genetic variants (the
vast majority of which fall in non-coding sequences) to target genes and causal cellular phenotypes, particularly
in a cell-type-specific and context-dependent manner. We previously uncovered an unexpected combinatorial
effect between risk genes that was not predicted from single gene perturbations, one that concentrated on
synaptic function and linked the rare and common variant genes implicated in psychiatric disease risk. Based on
our preliminary analyses and the work of others, we hypothesize that impact of genetic variants and stress
converge and interact to impact critical neuronal and glia functions. Here our objective is to evaluate psychiatric
and neurodegenerative risk variants, investigating convergent relationships between risk variants and stress
across the major cell types of the brain. To do this, we will functionally dissect the impact of genetic variants
significantly associated with brain disease, exploring their regulatory impact across cell types (neurons,
astrocytes, glia) and contexts (physiological and environmental stressors) (Aim 1). To extend these insights, we
will explore additive effects between risk variants and stressors at the level of network expression and cellular
function (Aim 2). Finally, to test the extent that these insights might result in clinically actionably information, we
will the clinical consequences of gene-environment interactions across two large healthcare and population-
based biobanks (Aim 3). The translational impact of our work includes potential improvements to additive
polygenic risk scores, prioritization of convergent genes for mechanistic follow-up, and identification of pathways
that might serve as potential therapeutic targets. Our overarching goal is to advance the field towards an era of
precision medicine, whereby not just each patient’s genetic variants, but also the expected interactions between
them, can be used to predict disease trajectory and potential therapeutic interventions."
10895387,"Overview: This proposal directly addresses one of the most critical public health challenges impacting the
health and survival of people with HIV (PWH) and/or tuberculosis (TB) in South Africa (SA): smoking.
Background/Significance: Smoking reduces antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence among PWH,
compromising HIV treatment outcomes, and is linked to lower TB treatment adherence among patients newly
diagnosed with TB, as well as to TB treatment failure, loss to follow up during treatment, and death during or
after treatment.
Preliminary studies: In this R34 application, we propose to develop a smoking cessation intervention tailored
to the SA context that improves disease outcomes for both HIV and TB, bringing together our experience from
two overlapping areas of research. First, we completed a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that established initial
efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability of a cognitive behavioral therapy smoking cessation intervention (QUIT) for
PWH in the US, which increased biologically-verified abstinence rates at 6 months compared to controls.1
Second, we recently completed an efficacy/effectiveness trial of a cognitive behavioral ART adherence
intervention, which successfully increased HIV treatment adherence and reduced viral load among PWH in Cape
Town.2 Therefore, our US- and SA-based investigator team has expertise in smoking cessation treatment
development for individuals with chronic disease and in adapting evidence-based, cognitive behavioral strategies
for treatment adherence in a low-resource setting.
Approach: We now propose to extend this body of work by developing QUIT-AD, a novel intervention which will
integrate our QUIT program with cognitive behavioral strategies that have been culturally adapted to improve
treatment adherence among PWH and/or TB in SA. To do so, we will: more thoroughly understand (a) barriers
to smoking cessation among adults with HIV and/or TB and (b) barriers to TB treatment adherence among adults
with TB who use tobacco (Aim 1); adapt the QUIT protocol, adding and removing content as appropriate based
on the formative data, and conduct a small proof-of-concept open trial (n = 5; Aim 2); and assess the feasibility
and acceptability of the intervention in a pilot RCT to be task shifted to lay counselors (Aim 3). Secondary
outcomes of the RCT will be biologically-verified point prevalence tobacco abstinence, number of cigarettes
smoked in the past week, and favorable HIV/TB treatment outcome at 6 months.
Outcomes/next steps: These aims will lay the groundwork for a full-scale, hybrid effectiveness/implementation
trial which could change the smoking cessation treatment landscape in SA, provide an empirically supported
program for PWH and/or TB, and serve as a model for future work to sustain smoking abstinence among
individuals with chronic diseases in resource-limited settings."
10930818,"ADMINISTRATION CORE Abstract
The proposed Research Evaluating Vagal Excitation and Anatomical Linkages (REVEAL) center aims to conduct groundbreaking research on the effect of vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) on four key systems: the autonomic nervous system, the cardiovascular system, the immune system, and the metabolic system. The ambitious scope of the research requires the participation of eight major academic and medical institutions with over 40 participating key personnel, over 140 patients, an External Advisory Board (which includes patient advocates), and an NIH Steering Committee and other NIH personnel. As such, a well-planned, well-organized, and well- staffed Administration Core is crucial to coordinate the many REVEAL stakeholders so that the center can achieve its goals and produce foundational data for new VNS research and new VNS-based therapies. The Administration Core for REVEAL will be led by two medical scientists from the University of Minnesota (UMN) who have complimentary scientific expertise and extensive experience leading multidisciplinary teams: Dr. John Osborn (REVEAL Director), an expert in the autonomic nervous system and the director of the Minnesota Consortium for Autonomic Neuromodulation, and Dr. Sayeed Ikramuddin (Reveal MPI), Head of the UMN Department of Surgery and a clinical researcher and surgeon with experience in clinical trial design of interventions on metabolomic endpoints. The main goals of the Administration Core are to facilitate interactions between the Cores and Ancillary Projects to maximize REVEAL’s productivity; coordinate all REVEAL meetings, including an Annual VESPA Meeting; ensure clear lines of communication between Project/Core PIs, the NIH, and external groups; and manage the REVEAL budget and finances."

10930822,"ANCILLARY PROJECT 1 Abstract: Microelectrode Recordings from the Vagus Nerve in Awake Humans
The vagus nerve, the longest cranial nerve, supplies structures in the neck, thorax, and abdomen with sensory and motor innervation, including parasympathetic innervation to the heart, lungs, airways, and gut. Unlike the sympathetic nervous system, in which it has been possible to make direct microelectrode recordings in humans for >50 years, it has not been possible to record parasympathetic outflow directly – until now. We developed an ultrasound-guided approach that allows us to record directly from the vagus nerve via a microelectrode inserted percutaneously into the neck of awake humans. In this Ancillary Project, we plan to build upon our preliminary data from this approach by undertaking a detailed neurophysiological investigation of the human vagus nerve and identifying the nerve fibers activated during vagal nerve stimulation, both sensory and motor (including parasympathetic) axons. This may provide a specified range of stimulus intensities required to excite myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibers in the Clinical Study Protocol as described in the Clinical Core. It will also provide unprecedented detail into the physiology of the human vagus nerve and inform future development of novel intrafascicular neural interfaces."
10930824,"ANCILLARY PROJECT 2 Abstract: Effect of VNS on Gastric Motor Functions
The prevalence of gastroparesis (i.e., inability for the stomach to empty itself normally) ranges from 13.8 to 267.7 per 100,000 adults; in addition, 2.5% are hospitalized each year, with 0.3% mortality. There is no consistently effective treatment for this condition: the only FDA-approved medication, metoclopramide, can only be used for
<12 weeks because of risk of the debilitating movement disorder tardive dyskinesia. To gather key data as a foundation for new gastroparesis treatment, we propose to evaluate the effect of left vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) on gastric emptying and accommodation functions in patients undergoing treatment for depression or epilepsy. Whereas the effects of VNS on other functions such as sleep patterns or heart period responses reflecting cardiovagal innervation have been reported, the effects of such treatment on gastric functions are unknown. It is clear, however, that the vagus nerve provides the extrinsic input to cholinergic intrinsic neurons that stimulate gastric muscle contractility and to the nitrogen-intrinsic neurons that mediate gastric accommodation. Our hypothesis is that cervical VNS increases gastric accommodation and accelerates gastric emptying. Our specific aim is to compare simultaneous assessment of gastric emptying and gastric accommodation in response to the same caloric meal before and three months after activation of left cervical VNS. The functions of the stomach will be measured using validated methods conducted simultaneously using SPECT camera imaging and a radiolabeled meal, with a first measurement of gastric volume during fasting after intravenous injection of pertechnetate and a second measurement of postprandial gastric volume accommodation and gastric emptying following the ingestion of a 320 kilocalorie, 30% fat egg meal. These innovative studies will document the effect of VNS as the foundation for a potential novel treatment for correcting disorders of gastric motor function."
10879011,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death and disability in the United States with a disproportional
effect on southern regions of the country. Louisiana is substantially affected by cardiovascular disease with
nearly one quarter of deaths in the state attributed to it. While advances in cardiovascular treatments have been
realized, many disease mechanisms remain poorly understood. It has become increasingly clear that changes
in heart and vascular oxidant stress and antioxidant defenses, the so called ‘redox balance’, plays critical roles
in disease initiation and propagation. However, specific disease mechanisms controlled by redox biology
pathways remains poorly defined, which requires further study and research in this area. The Center for Redox
Biology and Cardiovascular Disease (CRBCD) Phase 1 CoBRE at LSU Health Shreveport brought together
numerous junior investigators with state-of-the-art knowledge and expertise across different departments to
address redox biology molecular mechanisms contributing to cardiovascular pathophysiology. The intent of this
Phase 2 proposal is to continue growth of the CRBCD CoBRE and continue recruitment of junior faculty to the
program and institution to increase competitiveness of major research grant programs. Individual junior faculty
primary projects have been chosen based on their relevance to the research theme, novelty of the research topic
regarding redox biology and cardiovascular disease, and their potential ability to achieve independent major
research funding. Cutting edge research core facilities have begun and will continue to grow to serve the needs
of the CoBRE program, institution, and others across the nation. The CRBCD CoBRE has also greatly benefitted
from a world class advisory committee that remains committed to continue providing input and advise throughout
the Phase 2 program. Together, the proposed projects will provide advanced understanding of redox biology
pathophysiology mechanisms during cardiovascular disease with support from advanced, state of the art animal
models and redox molecular pathology research core facilities. Research and professional development
programs are also proposed that will provide continued growth and leadership for all associated participants and
trainees."
10879014,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The goal of the Center for Redox Biology and Cardiovascular Disease is to improve the infrastructure for junior
and senior investigators and to provide mentoring for the junior faculty members so that they become more
competitive for independent NIH funding. The Animal Models & Histology Core B, led by Dr Karen Stokes,
provides services to both the COBRE members and others at our institute, with 28 users thus far in Phase 1.
Core services are also available to nearby institutes at which our cardiovascular researchers have collaborations.
A needs survey of faculty identified some key new equipment/services that faculty require for growth of their
research programs, with an anticipated increase to 32 users in Phase 2. Dr Hugh Price will continue to lead the
Histology and Genotyping Subcore. This will build upon current existing services that provide tissue processing,
cardiovascular-related stains, and a genotyping service, to add an immunohistochemistry service (with an
automated stainer to help maintain robust histology and genotyping services). The Cardiovascular Phenotyping
Subcore, led by Dr Shenu Bhuiyan, will continue to provide capabilities to characterize the disease models.
Current equipment includes a Peri-med PSI system and Periflux 5000 to non-invasively image and measure
blood flow, a VisualSonics Vevo 3100 Ultra High Frequency Ultrasound to study cardiac and vascular function,
an AD Instruments MPVS-Ultra single segment Pressure-Volume Unit for in depth cardiac function
measurements, two TSE telemetry systems for continuous recording of blood pressure, activity, temperature,
and biopotentials, and an OxyletPro System with a single lane mouse calorimetry treadmill for VO2 max
determination during forced exercise. In Phase 2, the telemetry and OxyletPro systems will be complemented
by the addition of a CODA High Throughput Noninvasive blood pressure system, for low-cost simultaneous blood
pressure measurements in 8 mice/rats, and a 5-lane treadmill for higher throughput exercise regimens
respectively, and a blood gas/basic clinical chemistry analyzer will be added. This subcore will also facilitate
more in depth clinical chemistry analysis (e.g. organ specific or lipid panels) by external sources. Full-time
research technicians have been well-trained on all current modalities and will be trained on future services, so
that they can continue to either provide the services, or train lab personnel to perform their experiments using
the available technologies. The CCDS Surgical Core will continue to liaise with the CoBRE Core B to implant
telemetry probes, and to set up surgical rodent models that undergo subsequent phenotyping in Core B. Taken
together, the services offered by the Animal Models and Histology Core will help PIs generate animal models
suitable for their research questions, and provide cutting edge phenotypic and pathological analysis to maximize
the competitiveness of our junior faculty for future funding in the area of redox regulation of cardiovascular
disease."
10879015,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The goals of the COBRE Center for Redox Biology and Cardiovascular Disease are to establish a nationally
recognized advanced research and training program in redox biology regulation of cardiovascular disease and
to facilitate the development of junior faculty research programs to achieve major independent research funding.
The Redox Molecular Signaling Core (Core C) provides COBRE investigators and trainees with access to
modern equipment for the detection and quantification of reactive oxygen species, reactive nitrogen species,
and reactive sulfur species. Additionally, this facility enables the analysis of redox-dependent control of protein
function through redox proteomics and metabolomics, provides a centralized facility for cell culture hypoxia
studies, and provides expertise for establishing cell culture models of redox signaling. This range of analytical
techniques to assess redox signaling will be unmatched for a single facility in Louisiana. The functions of the
Redox Molecular Signaling Core are accomplished through two distinct sub-cores, the Analytical Redox Biology
Sub-Core and the Molecular Signaling Sub-Core. The Analytical Redox Biology Sub-Core utilizes equipment for
high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), specialized chemiluminescent detectors, and mass
spectrometry (MS) to provide high quality, quantitative redox measurements at a centralized facility with
dedicated technical staff. During Phase I, the institution purchased an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer
that significantly expanded our capability to perform proteomic analysis of cell and tissue function in models of
redox signaling. During Phase II, we will expand the functionality of this core through the purchase of new
equipment for reactive sulfur species quantification and additional mass spectrometry equipment to enhance
sensitivity. The Molecular Signaling Sub-Core offers a centralized facility for providing assistance with molecular
biology, for establishing cell culture models of redox signaling, and for affording access to vital equipment for
modeling hypoxic cell injury in culture and for protein analysis using high throughput, automated capillary
electrophoresis. In Phase II, we will mature and expand the Molecular Signaling Sub-Core by adding additional
core services based on the needs of the current COBRE faculty, such as improved methods for transient
transfection of primary cells and enhanced access to next generation sequencing technologies. The faculty and
staff of the Redox Molecular Signaling Core work closely with the COBRE investigators to optimize experimental
design, perform analytical measurements, provide training on the use of core equipment, and assist with data
collection and interpretation. These services provide an invaluable benefit to the COBRE investigators to
advance their individual projects while enhancing the infrastructure of local redox-biology research."

The Advanced Fabrication and Testing (AFT) Core is the enabling technological engine of the SC-TRIMH. It
harvests the unique engineering strengths and capabilities at Clemson University to support the research
projects and expedite the translation of their innovations to patient-specific diagnosis and treatments of
musculoskeletal diseases at the molecular, cellular, tissue, and body levels. In Phase I, the AFT Core expanded
to now cover over 4,400 sq ft when it consolidated all its services in a new building in order to provide more
centralized services for electrical, mechanical, optical, and material designs, rapid prototyping, sensors and
instrumentation, and advanced testing for the TRIMH investigators. The core also expanded its instrumentation
(e.g. integrated additive and subtractive manufacturing, plus femtosecond laser for ultrafast micromachining)
via awards from DOE and a TRIMH supplement. During this time the AFT Core provided services to all 8 TRIMH
Research Project Leaders (RPL), 8 other TRIMH Pilot Project Leaders, and 12 Clemson PIs. Seven other PIs
from the state of South Carolina (SC) and 6 others outside SC used this core; along with three industrial clients.
This core is especially important to those who do not have primary expertise in the engineering disciplines, as
we have both turnkey services and tailored “hand holding”/mentoring. The AFT core in Phase I has supported
nearly 50 PIs, contributed to 30 grant applications, and generated more than 30 publications. In Phase II, we
will be supporting the research projects of all 4 RPLs while we continue to expand and sustain the engineering
capabilities and strive to build the AFT Core into a leading biomedical engineering resource, especially for
musculoskeletal related research at Clemson University, South Carolina, and beyond. The goal will be achieved
by three specific aims: Aim 1: expand and sustain the design and rapid prototyping capabilities to enable TRIMH
researchers to quickly design and build simulated musculoskeletal components, systems or environments that
are physical and biological replica of the human models, Aim 2: expand and sustain the sensor, instrumentation,
and testing capabilities to enable the investigators to design, fabricate and install sensors onto the physical and
biological replica for in situ measurement of various parameters and validation of the virtual human models, and
Aim 3: promote and sustain the AFT core as a leading biomedical engineering “go-to-place” for musculoskeletal
research at Clemson University, the state of South Carolina, and beyond. The AFT Core will be led by a
multidisciplinary team with the combined expertise in engineering designs (mechanical, optical, electrical, and
material), advanced manufacturing, rapid prototyping, sensors, instrumentation, imaging, and advanced testing.
The COBRE funds will continue to support experienced staff members to operate/maintain the consolidated
facilities, to train/mentor TRIMH investigators to translate their innovations into clinical successes, to further
enhance the capability of the core, and to facilitate the transition of the AFT Core to a competitive and self-
sustained program."

A major purpose of the COBRE South Carolina Center for Translational Research for Improving Musculoskeletal
Health (SC-TRIMH) is to promote and enable research and innovation addressing bone and joint disorders for
the improvement of patient care. Animal models and human cadaveric models are essential for verifying
musculoskeletal research hypotheses, and are intrinsic to the pre-clinical assessment strategy for diagnostics
and treatments, for novel technology evaluation, and for the verification of computational models. The mission
of the Pre-clinical Assessment Core (PAC) is to provide mentoring and strategic planning to SC-TRIMH
investigators for the use of live large animal models and/or human cadaver models in their musculoskeletal
research programs. It provides the specialized facilities, expertise, and resources needed by SC-TRIMH
investigators to further evaluate the potential of their in vitro advances into clinical practice. In COBRE Phase I,
PAC has consolidated unique resources and expertise at Clemson University and the PRISMA Health System
(PHS) into a comprehensive network of experts and services organized into two complementary thrusts: the Live
Animal Modeling (LAM) and Human Cadaveric Modeling (HCM) thrusts. LAM includes state-of-art biomedical
research and animal imaging facilities at the AAALAC-accredited Godley-Snell Research Center and the
Clemson Farms enabling access to the full spectrum of animal models used in musculoskeletal research as well
as flexibility for the development of novel models needed by SC-TRIMH investigators. Over the years, Clemson
University, through its Bioengineering Department, has built an impressive portfolio of musculoskeletal innovative
research using large animal models which laid the foundation for PAC capabilities in Phase I. The HCM thrust,
located at the Clemson University Biomedical Engineering Innovation Campus (CUBEInC), includes the Bioskills
Surgical Training and Innovation Center and other resources. As the health innovation hub for Clemson
University since 2011, CUBEInC is located at the PRISMA Health System above orthopaedic patient clinics and
physical therapy. In Phase I, PAC integrated into its training program, the CUBEInC's resources and expertise
in technology development and maturation, as well as start-up company development and mentoring, further
increasing awareness of SC-TRIMH investigators about the innovation cycle. The PAC leadership team consists
of the thrusts' co-directors, both renowned clinicians and scientists, and a support group of facility managers,
technical experts, and scientists. In Phase II, PAC will continue to provide technical mentoring and support to all
SC-TRIMH investigators, especially those who do not have primary expertise in pre-clinical assessment, while
progressing toward being the major translational resource for musculoskeletal researchers from across South
Carolina and elsewhere. The specific aims of PAC are to 1) continue providing expertise and support for pre-
clinical modeling, 2) continue serving as a facilitator for junior investigator pre-clinical research, and 3) further
strengthen and enhance the in vivo and ex vivo pre-clinical research capability to support SC-TRIMH."

Phenotypic differences between males and females, termed sexual dimorphism, are a critical biological variable.
Sex-based variation produces distinct biting kinematics, differential prevalence and severity of musculoskeletal
conditions, and a variety of medical issues often requiring surgery. Despite these data indicating a clear impact
of sex on craniofacial function and health, a critical gap in our knowledge includes the developmental stage at
which males and females begin to differ in phenotype, including in common model organisms such as mice,
chickens, and fishes. Further, we do not know the underlying mechanisms that generate variation in sexual
dimorphism, such as the effects of genetic background and hormone signaling, particularly in early facial
development. We model human sexual dimorphism using cichlid fishes, which have evolved exceptional
craniofacial variation, enable easy manipulation of embryonic development through immersion of animals in
chemicals, and mirror human sexual dimorphism in terms of effects on the mandible and variation due to genetic
background. Given that the molecules that control facial development are highly conserved across vertebrates,
this work may identify new mechanisms and genes that regulate musculoskeletal variation in humans. For
example, Pdgfra regulates orofacial clefting in humans, mice, and fishes. The central question of this project is
how sex generates functional variation in shape of the craniofacial skeleton. This Phase 2 application will focus
on morphology, developmental time, and candidate genes to lay the foundations for future R01 applications
focused on cellular and molecular mechanisms. In Aim 1, we will assess developmental origins of sexual
dimorphism in bone shape and material properties between the sexes. We will also evaluate genetic risk factors
that add further variation to sex-based phenotypes. These data will define when sex generates variation in the
craniofacial skeleton and identify specific bones, timepoints, and candidate genes for a future R01 grant. In Aim
2, we will assess the morphological role of sex hormones in embryonic bone development. We predict that these
hormones not only regulate bone patterning in both sexes, but variation in hormone signaling drives male-female
differences and species-specific presentation of sexual dimorphism. Completion of this aim will extend our
knowledge of hormones in adult bone biology to embryonic stages, which is currently a major gap in our
understanding. We will also identify developmental windows and critical cell types for future mechanistic study
in an R01 application. This project was conceptualized for an initial SC-TRIMH due to potential integration within
this group and utilizes the Pre-clinical Assessment Core (PAC), Multiscale Computational Modeling (MCM) core,
Advanced Fabrication & Testing (AFT) core, and the Administrative Core. It also synergizes with two other
COBRES at Clemson University that support the Clemson University Genomics and Bioinformatics Facility which
is important for Aim 1.2."

One of the important signaling networks in embryonic development, regeneration, and homeostasis of tissue is
the endogenous bioelectricity. It has been observed that electric fields can promote axonal regrowth in nerve
injury and bioelectric stimuli can be crucial to induce regeneration in peripheral and central nervous systems.
However, the transduction mechanisms that allow cells to convert bioelectric signals into gene regulatory
networks and transmit them to recipient cells via exocytosis pathways has not been fully understood. The
overarching goals of this MIRA application for the next five years will be to understand the effect of endogenous
electric fields on exocytosis pathway through the small extracellular vesicles (EVs); and to use this knowledge
in the future to establish a new EV-based therapeutic to restore function and repair of neurons in neurological
disorders and injuries. To address the knowledge gaps, we aim to first electrically stimulate Schwann cells (SCs),
the glial component of peripheral nervous system, by developing a biomimetic piezoelectric nanofiber networks
to mimic the endogenous bioelectric stimuli. The proposed bioactive piezoelectric nanofibers will be
advantageous over current technologies since they have high spatial resolution and high surface to volume ratio
that can promote cells attachment and alignment. Also, the piezoelectric properties of fibers allow cells to self-
induce electrical stimulation as a result of mechanobiology which can better mimic the endogenous
mechanotransduction feedback loop between cellular networks in a three-dimensional (3D) microenvironment.
We further plan to investigate the role of EVs secreted from electrically stimulated SCs, as cargos to transmit
the bioelectric signals by means of RNAs and proteins to neurons and to study their functional role in promoting
the axonal regeneration."
10933430,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A fundamental question in cell biology is how cells measure and maintain their characteristic sizes. We use two
systems in Drosophila development to study cell size control that provide a natural system for uncoupling
growth and division: embryogenesis and oogenesis. The early embryo is an extremely large cell that
undergoes rapid divisions without cell growth, while the oocyte uses polyploid nurse cells to grow to a massive
size without dividing. In the embryo, the final cell size is determined by the nucleus to cytoplasm ratio (N/C
ratio). The N/C ratio controls a major developmental transition known as the mid-blastula transition (MBT)
where the cell cycle stops and zygotic transcription initiates. Recently, we discovered a surprising mechanism
for N/C-ratio sensing in the pre-MBT embryo. Hyper-abundant maternally provided histone H3 acts as a
competitive inhibitor of the DNA-damage checkpoint kinase, Chk1, to prevent cell cycle slowing. As more and
more nuclei are generated by the successive divisions the pool of “free” (ie-not chromatin-incorporated) H3 is
imported into the increasing numbers of nuclei and then incorporated into chromatin thereby releasing Chk1
inhibition to allow cell cycle slowing once a threshold N/C ratio is reached. In oogenesis, polyploid nurse cells
generate the maternal supply of materials required for the egg and “dump” their contents into the oocyte to
achieve the correct volume. Histone biogenesis appears to play a role in regulating progression through
oogenesis as well, though the molecular mechanism is unclear. Over the next five years, work in this R35
MIRA proposal will: 1) interrogate the molecular mechanisms by which maternally provided H3 contributes to
cell size sensing at the MBT; 2) understand how the N/C ratio affects nuclear and chromatin composition
leading up to the MBT; and 3) extend the lab’s current models of cell size sensing to the growing egg chamber.
These projects will further the long-term goal of understanding cell size and cell cycle control in a diverse array
of tissue types and developmental timepoints. The resulting insights will expand our understanding of
fundamental processes shared by most living cells but that are obscured in other model systems by the tight
coupling between cell size and cell cycle progression."
10916376,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Transcription factors (TFs) compose a subset of proteins that regulate the expression of a wide range of genes
in cells. Instructing many tissue- and cell-type specific gene expression programs in the body, transcriptional
regulation is one of the major mechanisms of cell differentiation and polarization induced by TFs. Understanding
the dynamics of transcriptional regulation is crucial since it is a critical component of cell, tissue, organ and
system development and its dysregulation can lead to many complex diseases. Transcriptional regulation is best
modeled via directed networks in which the edges originating from transcription factors to their downstream
targets represent regulatory relationships. However, building, optimizing and analyzing transcriptional regulatory
networks (TRNs) is highly challenging due to inherent complexity of such networks. Moreover, the dynamic wiring
in these networks evolves over time during cell and tissue differentiation and presents a continuous trajectory,
instead of discrete states. Current approaches for understanding this dynamic system are mainly based on gene
expression and are underpowered to accurately model such networks because alterations in gene regulation
often take place via changes in chromatin architecture. Further, existing methods either disregard or oversimplify
the heterogeneous nature of network states in cell populations, thereby leading to a loss of resolution. In this
proposal, we hypothesize that continuous cell differentiation trajectories are driven by evolutions in the
transcriptional network wiring, which are induced by alterations in the chromatin architecture. Our overarching
goal in this research program is to elucidate the continuous evolution of regulatory wirings associated with
developmental stages or disease conditions using cell-specific TRNs that are constructed from single-cell
epigenomic data. To reach this goal, we will build TRNs using motif analysis coupled with multiple single-cell
epigenomic sequencing data, including chromatin accessibility (ATAC-Seq), DNA methylation (BS-Seq), histone
modification (ChIP-Seq) and three-dimensional chromatin interaction (Hi-C) at single-cell resolution. We will use
these networks to uncover the regulatory changes associated with cell differentiation and discover the key
transcriptional regulators that drive the cells along developmental trajectories or across the disease states. We
will also detect transcriptional regulatory modules within these networks to discover pathways associated with
cell differentiation. Finally, we will apply our approach to multiple domains and test our hypothesis using biological
models. Altogether these studies will establish a system of dynamic network models for unraveling epigenetic
regulation at a high resolution. This integrated set of models will not only facilitate an accurate understanding of
epigenetic regulation in development but will also be a powerful asset for discovering targets for therapeutic
interventions for a wide range of complex diseases associated with transcriptional dysregulation."

The Oncology Research Training Program (ORTP) has been in existence for 40 years and was developed with
the primary goal of preparing physician-trainees (fellows in Adult Medical Oncology) for careers in academic
medicine. The rationale for training in oncology research is four fold: (a) Cancer remains one of the leading cause
of morbidity and mortality; (b) there is a need to maintain momentum that has been achieved in our fundamental
understanding of carcinogenesis, genomics and immunology (c) there is a need to translate progress gained in

(2) Biomarkers in cancer prevention and therapy; (3) Molecular targets of drug discovery and experimental
therapuetics of cancer; (4) Immunological approaches to cancer therapy and (5) Health services research
focused on delivery, outcomes, reform and value. The trainees selected for this program will first experience
well-defined curriculum and training to the important concepts in the chosen research theme, and then spend 2-
3 years in the relevant laboratory and/ or clinical or health services research environment under the direct
supervision of a training program faculty mentor. The trainees will develop skills in: (a) to identify important
questions in oncology research (b) develop testable hypotheses that will address the pertinent questions (c)
aquire the necessary technical expertise to rigorously test the hypotheses identified; (d) critically evaluate the
data generated; (e) develop the necessary skills of written and oral communication to promulgate the conclusions
made and (f) develop and compete of peer-reviewed grants. The trainees will have an MD or MD-PhD degree,
completed residency training in Internal Medicine and a year of clinical subspecialty training in ADULT medical
oncology/hematology. The ultimate goal of the program is to prepare trainees for careers in academic oncology
as independent faculty members in schools of medicine at research universities."

In women, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and leading cause of cancer related deaths
worldwide, with approximately 2.3 million new cases and 685,000 deaths in 2020. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy
(NAC) is commonly applied to reduce the tumor size before surgery for breast neoplasms. Unfortunately, due
to the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of breast tumors, not all patients respond to conventional NAC.
Currently, only about 22% of patients show pathologic complete response (pCR), while the remaining non-pCR
patients show either partial response (54% of all patients) or no response to chemotherapy. Early prediction of
tumor response to chemotherapy to identify non-responders could 1) reduce unnecessary side effects and
costs related to ineffective therapy, and 2) help physicians tailor the treatment plan earlier to achieve better
therapeutic outcomes and improve survival. Monitoring tumor response to chemotherapy is currently based on
tumor size measured by physical exam, which is subjective, difficult to quantify, and most importantly,
temporally delayed compared to underlying biological changes. Quantitative, repeatable and objective methods
that could provide an early detection of tumor physiological changes before size changes could significantly
improve treatment outcome and the quality of patient care. However, quantitative imaging poses significant
technical challenges, which is rarely performed in the clinical setting. Here, we propose to leverage Magnetic
Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF), a revolutionary new platform for quantitative MR that was invented by our
team, to develop new imaging biomarkers for early assessment of treatment response in women with breast
cancer. Our team has developed a breast MRF method to simultaneously generate quantitative 3D T1 and T2
maps in ~6 minutes with excellent reproducibility. We have also expanded our MRF method to simultaneous
quantify T1, T2 and ADC maps of the brain with no image distortion. Here, we plan on optimizing this new
relaxometry / diffusion MRF method specifically for women with breast cancer (Aim 1). Novel deep learning
methods will be developed to provide a fast (<5 minute) and high resolution (1.2 mm isotropic) acquisition for
whole-breast coverage along with an efficient post-processing pipeline based on cloud computation (Aim 2).
Finally, we will evaluate the developed method for early prediction of treatment response in two patient cohorts
with either HER2-positive or triple negative breast cancers (Aim 3). Upon successful completion of this project,
the developed MRF technique will provide a practical quantitative breast exam for early prediction of treatment
response to NAC and other treatment methods (hormone therapy, antibody-based target therapy, etc.) for
women with breast cancer, with the ultimate goal to reduce ineffective treatment in eligible subjects and tailor
the treatment methods for optimum therapeutic outcomes."
10915645,"Protein Structure, Dynamics, and Aggregation in Phase Separated Droplets
Abstract
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe and deadly disease. In recent years, it has been discovered that
a key mechanism of disease progression lies in liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of a number of peptides
and proteins. Indirect evidence has also emerged that LLPS can induce protein folding/aggregation into amyloid-
like hydrogels in a number of different diseases, including ALS, type-2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease. We
recently reported direct in-situ evidence that phase separation induces a folding transition for peptide and
proteins derived from ALS. This proposal aims to build on that work to develop and apply spectroscopic tools for
in-situ characterization of protein structure, dynamics, and solvation within phase-separated droplets, in order to
identify the structure and mechanism of formation of these folded proteins and gels, and to study how these
changes relate to the disease state of ALS. To accomplish this, we will use two-dimensional infrared
spectroscopy (2DIR), infrared microscopy, and 2DIR microscopy, to probe changes in secondary structure and
hydration of peptides and proteins within droplets, and understand the fundamental biophysical processes
involved in protein LLPS. Key questions that we aim to answer are: What role does solvation serve in the driving
forces governing LLPS? Can volumetric crowding in polymer dense LLPS droplets promote changes in protein
secondary structure? Can LLPS drive protein folding/aggregation into potentially toxic amyloid states? We will
be able to answer these questions for in-situ studies, something currently not possible with other techniques.
The strategy outlined in this proposal is designed with the long-term goal of building a research program that
can perform structural studies in complex biophysical systems, turning the full suite of structure sensitive
observables in nonlinear IR spectroscopy towards addressing questions in whole cell systems."
10930843,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Plasma membrane rupture (PMR) in lytic cell death—including pyroptosis, necroptosis, and post-apoptotic
secondary necrosis—is a cataclysmic event that releases large-size intracellular molecules known as damage-
associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which in turn propagate the inflammatory response. Lytic cell death
plays an important role in host defense against pathogen infections, but its dysregulation is also implicated in
many inflammatory diseases and pathological conditions. PMR was thought to be a passive event, until a recent
study identified NINJ1 to be responsible for carrying out this process. NINJ1 is a 16-kDa plasma membrane
protein previously identified to be mediating cell adhesion through homotypic binding. It has two transmembrane
helices and one extracellular amphipathic helix. NINJ1 undergoes oligomerization to induce PMR, and the
amphipathic helix seems to play an important role in this process. However, a highly similar protein NINJ2 in the
plasma membrane bearing a similar amphipathic helix does not induce PMR. To understand the molecular basis
of NINJ1-oligomerization mediated PMR, we use cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) to study the structures
of NINJ1 and NINJ2 oligomers. The progress we have made is shedding light on a mechanistic understanding
of this process. However, it also points to more hypotheses that need to be tested in order to fully understand
this fundamentally important process. PMR is also linked to glycine cytoprotection in a very recent study. It was
demonstrated that glycine treatment prevented NINJ1 oligomerization and thus prevented PMR in bone marrow
derived macrophages receiving various forms of lytic cell death stimuli. We will include glycine treatment in our
test of hypotheses for the search of signal that triggers NINJ1 oligomerization. This further elucidation of the
molecular basis of glycine cytoprotection would inform the development of better cell preservation strategies or
agents."
10930926,"Project Summary
Malaria is one of the leading health problems of the developing world. Malaria endemicity has
been attributed to poor diagnosis at the lab level. This quite often leads to disease misdiagnosis
and drug resistance. Many developing countries are faced with a lack of critical mass of lab
technicians to diagnose the disease through a gold standard mechanism of microscopy and this
has worsened the already dire situation in some of these Countries. World over the trending
technologies are now based on machine learning and deep learning techniques. These can be
leveraged with the combination of smartphones to improve disease diagnosis. However, most of
the previous work on automation for microscopy diagnosis has been carried out adhocly in the
lab environment and no study seems to give a practical field deployable solution. The goal of the
proposed research is to develop a rapid, low cost, accurate and simple in-field screening system
for microscopy challenges like malaria. Specifically, this study will test and validate developed
image analysis models for real time field-based diagnostics and surveillance of malaria. The
proposed solution builds from our earlier work on mobile microscopy carried out at Makerere
University AI Lab, that has confronted automated microscopy through exploiting recent
technological advances in 3D printing to enable development of a low-cost 3D printed adapter.
This has enabled attachment of a wide range of Smartphones on a microscope, furthermore, we
have implemented deep learning models for pathogen detection to produce effective hardware
and software respectively.
The software component of our work is to train machine learning methods to recognise different
pathogen objects. The diagnosis solutions have however been ad-hoc in its current state where
different conditional settings like image scaling, phone resolutions and grid readings were not
standardized and therefore poor performance of the model when deployed in field testing. Our
Infield automated screening trials will therefore involve achieving robust outcomes, through 1)
Development of machine learning approaches for standardised field-based microscopy of
malaria diagnosis in Uganda. 2) Building a complementary framework for real time
surveillance and improved diagnosis of malaria platform through in-field diagnostic
studies. The point-of-care field-based diagnostic system proposed here addresses a major
unmet public health malaria screening and surveillance need to reliably inform public health
interventions in malaria control and prevention."
10873916,"Project Summary – Immunometabolic Programs Controlled by ER Stress in Cancer
Tumors create hostile microenvironments that impede the development and maintenance of effective anti-cancer
immunity. Yet, how intratumoral immune cells integrate and interpret persistent stress signals in this harsh milieu
remains incompletely defined. We have uncovered that adverse conditions within malignant masses disrupt the
protein-folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in infiltrating immune cells, triggering dysregulated
“ER stress” responses that promote immunosuppression and malignant progression. Therefore, we postulate
that understanding and targeting detrimental ER stress responses in the tumor microenvironment
represents a major opportunity to develop new and more effective forms of cancer immunotherapy. In a
key recent advance, we determined that the IRE1a-XBP1s arm of the ER stress response inhibits the expression
of Tagln2, an understudied cytoskeletal protein implicated in T cell activation and effector function. We found
that XBP1s-deficient T cells demonstrate enhanced Tagln2 expression that supports their protective function at
tumor sites. Moreover, we established that Tagln2 coordinates major metabolic programs that sustain robust T
cell mitochondrial respiration and effector capacity. These new findings have prompted us to dissect the
mechanisms by which the novel IRE1a-XBP1s-Tagln2 axis controls T cell metabolism and function in cancer.
Hence, the goals of this project are to i) understand how ER stress inhibits Tagln2 expression, ii) establish that
Tagln2 equips T cells with robust metabolic fitness that supports their anti-tumor activity, and iii) determine that
Tagln2 replacement therapy enhances the activity of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells in solid tumors.
We hypothesize that dysregulated ER stress responses hinder intratumoral T cell function by disabling Tagln2-
driven bioenergetic programs, and that sustaining this cytoskeletal-mitochondrial axis could be used to improve
the efficacy of adoptive T cell immunotherapy in solid tumors. We will test this novel hypothesis in the setting of
immunotherapy-refractory ovarian cancer (OvCa) through the following Specific Aims:
Aim 1. Define the mechanisms by which ER stress responses inhibit Tagln2 in OvCa-infiltrating T cells.
Aim 2. Establish the role of Tagln2 as a metabolic driver of competent anti-tumor T cell function.
Aim 3. Test the hypothesis that preserving Tagln2 activity enhances CAR-T cell immunotherapy in OvCa.
Collectively, the proposed project will expand our mechanistic understanding of immune regulation in the tumor
microenvironment and promises to pave the way for novel interventions that augment the efficacy of cellular
immunotherapy against solid malignancies."
10932162,"Project Summary
Cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs) claim millions of lives in Africa every year and a sizable portion of these
deaths are premature. Despite the availability of simple and affordable approaches such as lifestyle adjustment
and the use of drugs (e.g. lipid lowering statins) that could increase lifespan and improve the quality of life, this
is becoming a more serious health burden in Africa with time. The ability to prioritize healthcare to the populations
that are at highest risk could be especially relevant in resource constrained environments. One of the major
challenges to accurately stratifying a population by risk is the low predictivity of current polygenic risk scoring
models (PRSs) in African populations.
The Integrated modeLs for Early Risk-prediction in Africa (ILERA) study (Ilera in Yourba means health) aims
to investigate the potential for improving the prediction of 13 cardiometabolic disease indicator levels (and
thereby of CMDs) by integrating diverse types of data (genomic, transcriptomic, lifestyle-related data) into risk
prediction models. Starting with currently best performing PRSs, we plan to progressively add layers of data
such as predicted transcriptomes, environment and lifestyle information to assess whether this additional data,
either independently or in combination with others, could improve prediction. To allow for complex and non-linear
interactions between these factors, data-driven approaches will be employed to integrate these variables with
the genomic data. In-depth evaluation of the predictivity of these models will be performed in independent cohorts
from South, East and West Africa and also in longitudinal data from the same cohort. The potential for an early
warning system aimed at public health intervention will be investigated using a combination of the best predictive
models and traits.
The project will be led from the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits), collaborating with the Wits Donald Gordon
Medical Center, the African Institute of Biomedical Science and Technology (ABiST) Zimbabwe and an US
based industry partner, Variant Bio. The predicted transcriptome will be based on 750 South African participants
with whole genome sequence and blood transcriptome RNA-Seq. The primary target dataset of ~5000
participants was generated through the H3Africa AWI-Gen study and the models will be tested in two Southern
African datasets (~1200 participants from South Africa and Zimbabwe) as well as ~6000 participants from
Ghana, Burkina Faso and Kenya. Longitudinal data, captured 5 years after baseline data collection, will be used
to understand the impact of age on the predictive models. The study will build on years of existing successful
collaboration and will tap into the Wits experience in genomics research, Variant Bio’s expertise in multi-omics
research and leverage partnership with other projects in the DSI-Africa consortium for data science capacity."
10930857,"To unravel the complexity of biological systems researchers have traditionally studied reductive model
systems like cultured cells or simple molecular simulations. While these reductive model systems can be
cheaper, easier, and/or more ethical to manipulate, findings in them may not translate to the biological systems
of primary interest. This is especially important for drug-discovery, as late-stage failures result in enormous
costs and long development timelines. Excitingly, recent advances in biotechnology and computing have made
more complex model systems—including 3D organoids and large-scale virtual screening—more tractable.
However, an emerging challenge is that standard statistical methods developed to analyze simple model
systems are insufficient to analyze these more complex model systems. Complex model systems are
inherently heterogeneous. The key statistical challenge is to leverage the higher dimensional readouts afforded
by the new technologies to identify the causal mechanisms relevant for translation. When done properly, better
statistical analysis can unlock the potential of new technology to better represent target biological systems with
more precision and less bias.
 The overarching theme of my research program is to develop causal inference methods for complex
model systems for pharmacology. Complex systems analyze in my group include morphological profiling,
where robotic confocal microscopes with multiplexed fluorescent dyes are used to rapidly characterize the rich
cellular morphological of individual cells, and large-scale virtual screening, where molecular simulations are
used prioritize compounds from make-on-demand libraries containing tens of billions of molecules. We draw
parallels across these distinct screening platforms, we develop and apply causal inference methods to better
guide translatable discoveries.
 Project one: Account for spatial call-to-environment and cell-to-cell interactions in morphological
profiling of organoids in 3D culture. Depending on the downstream application, spatial factors can either define
or confound relevant biological responses. We will develop global and local models for cellular spatial factors
and use them as statistical controls while avoiding selection bias to model the effects of chemical
perturbations.
 Project two: Mapping bioactive chemical space for adaptive large-scale virtual screening. AI guided
synthesis prediction is rapidly open new chemical spaces for virtual screening. However, it is not clear how to
take advantage of the increased chemical diversity to best improve target specific or selectivity. We propose to
train high-capacity deep-learning models to represent compounds based their compatibility with ligand binding
sites. This chemical-space map will enable characterizing how perturbations to virtual screening binding sites
and simulation methods effect the distribution of predicted ligands."

The North County San Diego Bridges to the Baccalaureate (NCSD B2B) program supports the NIH/NIGMS
goal of increasing the diversity of the biomedical workforce by increasing the successful transfer rates of
underrepresented (UR) groups from community colleges to 4-year institutions. The NCSD B2B program
continues a 20-year successful B2B consortium of the partner institutions of California State University San
Marcos (CSUSM), Palomar College and MiraCosta College. This new B2B Program will focus on the academic
development and seamless transfer of Palomar and MiraCosta UR community college students to CSUSM or
other 4-year institutions. The NCSD B2B Program targets UR students early in their community college
attendance to enroll them in an up to two-year structured academic, research, and career awareness and
development program. By targeting UR students early in their schooling, a known high dropout period, the
program helps prepare them academically, creates individual development plans for successful transferring,
helps foster their science identities through peer-mentoring and training in rigorous and reproducible research
practices. The specific aims of the NCSD B2B Program are to: 1) Attract a Large Pool of Promising
Underrepresented Science Majors for the Bridges Program through broad and proactive diversity recruitment
activities; 2) Empower Bridges Scholars to Accumulate Academic Credentials and Professional Skills
Necessary to Pursue Bachelor’s Degrees and Careers in the Biomedical Sciences through newly designed
curriculum, Supplemental Instruction, academic support and skill workshops; 3) Engage Bridges Scholars in
Meaningful Biomedical Research and Career Experiences including exposure to the diversity of biomedical
fields, placement in faculty research labs (often with UR peers or Bridges alumni), attendance of research
seminars, and conferences; 4) Expose Students to a Culturally Validated Pedagogy to Increase Belonging and
Persistence through seminars, workshops and social activities; 5) Participate in Summer Training Program to
Enhance Research and Quantitative Skills during a summer research experience and workshops; and 6)
Ensure Efficient transfer of Bridges Scholars to 4-year institutions and ultimately completion of a bachelor’s
degree through frequent and long-term mentoring, and curricular activities. Over the last 15 years, of the 226
students who completed the CSUSM Bridges program, 211 have transferred to 4-year institutions (93%), and
204 (90%) have or are on track to obtain their bachelor’s degree (145 completed, 59 in progress). In addition,
49 (22%) are in progress or have completed a Ph.D., M.D. or D.O. program (16 complete, 33 in progress). The
NCSD B2B Program will continue this successful history of preparing historically underrepresented persons
with the necessary education, experience, and mindset to pursue biomedical higher degree programs and
research careers."
10908523,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Sepsis is a syndrome of life-threatening organ failure resulting from serious infection that contributes to at least
1.7 million U.S. hospital admissions annually. With mortality of 15-20%, sepsis kills 11 million people each year
around the world. Prompt, appropriate therapy with antibiotics and IV fluids can improve sepsis outcomes, but
many patients with sepsis do not receive optimal therapy. Unwarranted variation in practice between
physicians is an important contributor to this problem. In some areas of treatment, however, practice variation
reflects the fact that the optimal sepsis treatment strategy is not clear. In both situations, the mechanisms
underlying between-physician variation in sepsis care are largely unknown. This research program will apply
advanced epidemiologic, statistical, machine learning, and qualitative research methods to large, granular
clinical datasets to determine how physicians make critical management decisions — including decisions
related to antibiotic initiation, intravenous fluid resuscitation, and emergency department disposition — for
patients with sepsis. A key focus will be understanding how different styles of decision making interact with
different phenotypes of this heterogeneous syndrome to affect patient treatment and outcomes. Investigations
will also harness observed variation to inform causal inference about optimal sepsis management strategies
where current evidence is inadequate. In the process, this research will produce validated, scalable, and
generalizable tools to support high-quality “big data” sepsis research. The proposed research, which is well
matched to the NIGMS sepsis research priorities, will help health systems, researchers, and clinicians design
and deliver sepsis care, provide evidence to build decision support tools customized to patient phenotypes and
clinician decision styles, and lay the groundwork for future trials of sepsis care strategies and implementation
methods."

The goal of the proposed work is to leverage existing genomic data of blood cell traits from the
H3Africa and other initiative across Africa for novel gene discovery and genetic risk prediction in
Africa ancestry individuals using DSI-Africa funded Open Data Science Platform (ODSP) which
allows for effective collaborative research in a resource limited setting. Circulating blood cell traits are
critical intermediate clinical phenotypes for a range of disease outcomes including cardiovascular,
hematologic and infectious disease. Genetic factors play an important role in determining these traits.
However, hundreds of genetic loci have been identified using conventional genome-wide association
study (GWAS) approach in European and East Asian-ancestry populations. In view of the genetic
diversity of Africans from other ancestries, and their low representation of 1.1% in global GWAS,
more studies are required to unravel population specific variants that have been noted to exist in
blood cell traits. Given the central importance of Africa to human origins and disease susceptibility,
there is a clear scientific and public health need to develop large-scale efforts examining blood cell
traits susceptibility in populations of African descent, which might yield insights that will benefit other
ethnicities regarding disease etiology and potential therapeutic strategies. Specifically, we will
aggregate blood cell traits GWAS data across continental Africa and African Americans leveraging
existing partnership in Africa including H3Africa from ~35K individuals. We will test for association
between genetic variants and 15 blood cell traits in a meta-analysis GWAS and refine genetic
association signals at new and existing blood cell traits association loci. We will develop and assess
transferability of Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) for blood cell traits risk in Africa including evaluating the
predictivity of the blood cell traits PRS for a range of non-communicable diseases including
leukaemia (N=5,926), Hypertension (N = 39,784), Stroke (N=5,540), Diabetes mellitus (N=20,506)
and sickle cell disease (N= 5,704) in collaboration with participating non-academic partner on the
project (54gene Lagos Nigeria). Our proposal is directly aimed at a key mission of RFA-RM-22-023,
to support harnessing data science for health discovery, that will not only generate important findings
relevant to human health, but also serve as a vehicle to improve the genomic data science research
capacity in Africa. Our proposal also directly addresses the NIH strategic plan for data science. The
unique collaboration within the Human Heredity and Health in Africa (H3Africa) for a cross-group
analyse in Africa strengthen the capacity of scientific research through scientific training in all
participating institution, which facilitate opportunity for shared expertise and resources."
10927350,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Solid cancers are a leading cause of cancer related death in children and there is great interest in harnessing
recent progress in immunotherapy for the treatment of pediatric solid tumors. Immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI)
is the most active form of immunotherapy for adult solid cancers, but ICI is not effective in pediatric solid tumors.
This discrepancy is explained by the low mutational burden of pediatric solid tumors, since neoantigens arising
from tumor specific mutations are the target of the most potent ICI induced immune responses. Overexpressed
non-mutated self-antigens, that are not expressed on normal vital tissues, can serve as the basis for effective
immune therapies, but immune tolerance must be overcome to induce potent immune responses to this class of
molecules. This project focuses on Ewing Sarcoma (EWS) a prototype low mutation burden solid tumor, for
which progress has stalled. Standard therapies for EWS rely on dose intensive regimens largely developed in
the 1970s and 80s which leave survivors with severe, lifelong late effects. No targeted therapeutics have been
demonstrated to be effective. Few patients with metastatic or recurrent EWS survive. Using immunopeptidome
profiling, we discovered novel peptides from lipase-1 (LIPI) and IGF2 binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) that are
presented by HLA-A2+ on EWS. These non-mutant proteins are overexpressed at high levels in the vast majority
of EWS and are essentially absent from vital normal tissues, thereby demonstrating a very favorable profile for
immune targeting. To translate this discovery into a therapeutic application for EWS, this project applies a
workflow we developed to discover, characterize, and engineer T cells receptors (TCRs) targeting these
peptides. The major overarching challenge that the project addresses is determining the optimal approach to
identify and/or engineer high potency TCRs capable of targeting self-antigens without incurring cross-reactivity
that would result in unacceptable toxicity. In Aim 1, we test the hypothesis that TCRs targeting LIPI- and
IGF2BP1-derived peptides will be identified in HLA-A2+ hosts but will manifest low potency due to immune
tolerance. We will simultaneously discover and compare antigen reactive TCRs present in HLA-A2– hosts, which
we predict will be more potent, but may be unsafe due to cross-reactivity. In Aim 2, we use next generation
approaches to engineer natural TCRs, identified in HLA-A2+ hosts, into more potent, but safe antigen-specific
TCRs, through affinity maturation or catch bond engineering. Given the known risks for cross reactivity of high
potency TCRs, next generation engineered TCRs developed here will be closely vetted across several platforms
for cross-reactivity. In Aim 3, we use fitness enhancements developed in the Mackall lab to enhance the potency
of CAR T cells to enhance the potency of T cells expressing our lead candidate LIPI- and IGF2BP1-reactive
TCRs. The work conducted in this project will deliver state-of-the-art therapeutics ready for clinical testing in
EWS and provide general understanding regarding the optimal approach to engineer TCRs targeting self-
antigens, which will provide value in pediatric oncology and low mutation burden cancers beyond EWS."
10909924,"Chronic intestinal failure (CIF) is a devastating condition where individuals are unable to eat and
drink enough to meet basic survival needs. Patients with CIF are dependent on parenteral
nutrition (PN) delivered intravenously by a pump via an indwelling central venous catheter.
While PN is lifesaving, life-threatening complications can cause considerable morbidity, impair
quality of life (QOL) and carry significant mortality risk. Care of patients with CIF is very complex
and best delivered by experienced multi-disciplinary teams working in intestinal rehabilitation
programs (IRP). Our recent work has shown a critical lack of expertise in CIF among US
gastroenterologists and over half the states in the US do not have IRP. This lack of widely
available expertise results in significant healthcare disparities for patients with CIF. Our recent
work has shown that use of technology to disseminate knowledge through the LIFT-ECHO
Project, based on the well-established ECHO Model can fill a critical gap in CIF care.
Application of LIFT-ECHO to improve CIF patient care requires a systematic
dissemination and evaluation approach, engaging multiple key stakeholders. We will test
the hypothesis that clinical outcomes in patients with CIF will improve by providing virtual multi-
D support to non-expert physicians through an online learning model, the LIFT-ECHO Project.
Through intensive stakeholder engagement, we can disseminate and establish LIFT-ECHO to
improve clinical outcomes in CIF nationally.
AIM 1: To develop and validate an intestinal failure disease activity index (IF-DAI) that assesses
current clinical status in CIF patients and is sensitive to short-term and medium-term changes.
AIM 2: To demonstrate improved clinical outcomes and CIF/PN specific patient-reported quality
of life (PRQOL) in CIF patients by providing virtual multi-disciplinary support to their physicians
through LIFT-ECHO.
AIM 3: (a) We will undertake a pragmatic formative process evaluation of LIFT-ECHO in its
current state. (b) To disseminate process evaluation results of LIFT-ECHO nationally and
evaluate dissemination effectiveness.
Our study is the first application of the ECHO Model™ to a rare disease like CIF – our
dissemination strategy will provide a comprehensive evaluation framework and a toolkit
for assessment of ECHO™ implementation in the context of a rare disease.
Our application targets the SEN: NOT-HS-21-014 to develop and implement LIFT-ECHO to
address the disparities in access to expert care for patients with a chronic disease."
10876329,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Infectious disease treatment failure is a critical health issue. It is predicted to become the leading cause of
mortality by 2050, superseding cancer. Treatment failure can be caused by a combination of factors, including
active antimicrobial drug resistance, for example via efflux pumps, and pathogen dormancy, tolerance and
persistence mechanisms. However, these factors cannot alone account for all cases of treatment failure.
Indeed, bioavailability and pharmacokinetics are the 3rd most common cause of failure during drug
development. Pharmacokinetic studies, however, have predominantly focused on biofluid and tissue drug
levels. This is insufficient in the case of intracellular pathogens, where intracellular drug accumulation is critical
to ensure pathogen clearance. Single-cell mass spectrometry (SCMS) studies in the field of cancer drug
development have revealed extensive heterogeneity in intracellular drug levels. However, until now, the
technology and techniques to safely perform such analyses in the context of intracellular pathogen infection
have been lacking. This is a critical gap in our ability to understand infectious disease treatment failure and to
guide infectious disease drug development. To address this gap, proposal MPIs have developed a biosafety-
compatible SCMS method to quantify intracellular drug and metabolite levels in the context of Trypanosoma
cruzi parasite infection. The overall objective of this proposal is to demonstrate the broad applicability of this
method to determine the relationship between lower intracellular drug levels and drug metabolism vs failure to
clear intracellular pathogens. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that heterogenous intracellular drug
levels and intracellular drug metabolism is a key contributor to antimicrobial treatment failure, and that this
mechanism can be revealed using novel SCMS approaches with broad applicability. We will test this central
hypothesis using three complementary yet independent aims. Aim 1 will use a Trypanosoma cruzi parasite
infection system to relate heterogenous antiparasitic drug levels between cells, to in vitro T. cruzi treatment
failure. Aim 2 will use the same T. cruzi infection system to relate heterogenous antiparasitic drug metabolism
between cells, to in vitro T. cruzi treatment failure. Aim 3 will broaden the applicability of these SCMS
techniques to quantify specific antibacterials and antivirals, and to relate their levels to treatment failure in the
context of bacterial and viral infection. The proposed research is innovative because it will lead to the
development of a new bioanalytical technology to address the critical biological problem of antimicrobial
treatment failure. The proposed research is significant because it will lead to an expanded understanding of the
mechanisms of treatment failure in infectious diseases."

Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common oral malignancy and subtype of head and neck
cancer and frequently identified by dentists during routine care. OSCC is the sixth most common cancer
globally with incidence continuing to rise. Current therapies for OSCC are inadequate and OSCC are resistant
to immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI), resulting in frequent reoccurrence and poor rates of patient survival. The
development of targeted therapies for OSCC is hampered by the lack of common driving oncogene mutations,
but inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor is frequent in human papillomavirus (HPV) negative OSCC,
which contributes to treatment resistance, immune cell suppression, and reduced patient survival. Therefore,
new and innovative treatment approaches are desperately needed for OSCC and particularly those with
inactivated p53. Thus, we sought to identify new vulnerabilities in HPV-negative OSCC. It was believed that if
p53 was inactivated, cancer cells did not require Mdm2, which binds and regulates p53. However, challenging
this long-held belief, our results with cancers arising in p53-null mice showed that the Mdm2 oncogene was
required for the survival of p53-null murine cancers. Capitalizing on our paradigm-shifting discovery in mice,
our preliminary data reveal Mdm2 is a previously unknown and unexpected vulnerability in p53-inactivated
human OSCC. We propose that targeted loss of Mdm2 will effectively eliminate OSCC cells by activating p53-
independent mechanisms that signal for apoptosis and pathways that contribute to increasing
immunogenicity. Preliminary results with a novel Mdm2-targeted degrader we designed and synthesized
support this hypothesis. To further test our hypothesis, we propose to 1) investigate the cytotoxicity
mechanism(s), the required pathways, and in vivo efficacy with targeted Mdm2 loss with our Mdm2 PROTAC
in OSCC cells with various p53 alterations; and 2) investigate improving the immunogenicity of OSCC tumors
and overcoming ICI resistance with several approaches that include our Mdm2 PROTAC and immune
competent syngeneic mouse models. Completion of this study will uncover the specific requirements of Mdm2
in OSCC, significantly increasing the mechanistic understanding of the p53-independent functions of Mdm2,
and provide critical pre-clinical evaluation of potential novel therapy approaches for OSCC that increase
immunogenicity and overcome ICI resistance."
10714502,"ABSTRACT: The rapid accumulation of “big data” has initiated a new model for conducting cancer research
and has resulted in a pressing need for a workforce with quantitative skills. To meet this need we used our first
NCI R25 funding period to establish the Quantitative Sciences Undergraduate Research Experience (QSURE)
at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) in Summer 2018. QSURE provides experiential learning
over a 10-week period for up to 10 students in quantitative fields powered by the application of real-world data,
including biostatistics, epidemiology, health outcomes, and computational oncology. In only 5 years, QSURE
has demonstrated substantial demand for quantitative training and expanded the volume of students who
successfully engage in hands-on research in our department by nearly 4-fold. We have achieved the aims of
the first funding period and reported high post-program student and mentor satisfaction as well as improved
student competencies in all years. Most QSURE alumni (71%) have gone on to pursue a PhD or Master’s in a
quantitative field. We will build on these successes and use the next funding period to continue to cultivate a
cadre of responsible, rigorous quantitative scientists through an intensive multidimensional curriculum that
reinforces successful programmatic components, including hands-on research carried out under the guidance
of a faculty mentor, discussion series in the ethical and responsible conduct of research, educational seminars
illustrating wide applications of data, training workshops in quantitative methodology, training and opportunities
for written/oral scientific communication, and career and professional development. We will integrate new
components that address contemporary viewpoints in cancer research and prompt students to consider equity,
diversity, and inclusion in their own research. These will include patient led “fireside chats” that highlight the
role of research in the patient experience, panel discussions that provide global health perspectives through
exchanges with an NCI-funded program for Nigerian trainees, and student-led discussions of works that
reinforce themes in equity, diversity, and inclusion. We will recruit diverse cohorts of motivated undergraduate
interns with a passion for applying quantitative science to reduce cancer morbidity and mortality and evaluate
short- and long-term program success and use these outcomes to inform and disseminate best practices.
Since initial funding QSURE has demonstrated success and resilience in preparing and facilitating the next
generation of research scientists for graduate studies and careers in quantitative fields. During the next funding
period, we will reinforce the successes of our first funding period by designing an enhanced curriculum to help
students contextualize and broaden their understanding of the potential of quantitative science to advance and
support the health of all communities. QSURE will continue to prepare and facilitate interns for graduate
studies and careers in quantitative fields. This is vital to fulfilling our long-term vision of training strong
quantitative scientists dedicated to advancing cancer research."
10931387,"ABSTRACT
The ultimate goal of structural biology is to visualize biomolecules in action in their native environment and to
establish their structure-function relationship. Cellular cryo-electron and X-ray tomography have emerged as
powerful techniques for imaging complex biological samples such as intact cells, organelles, macromolecular
machines, and for quantifying the internal organization of biological objects in their native states in situ at
resolutions ranging from a few microns to tens of nanometers with X-rays to tens of angstroms with electrons.
However, compared to the mature techniques of X-ray crystallography and single-particle cryo-electron
microscopy, cellular tomography is yet to reach its potential due to a severe degradation in the resolution of
reconstructions because of the effects of mechanical misalignment and non-rigid sample deformation due to
radiation damage, missing-wedge artifacts, low signal-noise ratio in a crowded environment, and unresolved
conformational heterogeneity. To address these issues, we propose to leverage our new approach for automated
joint 3D alignment and regularized reconstruction that combines advances in iterative projection methods and
convex optimization to achieve better than state-of-the-art reconstruction resolution from severely misaligned
data. Infusing our framework with new advances in mathematical modeling and machine learning provides a
clear path to a host of new model-based and data-driven algorithms that could address current challenges and
bottlenecks in the analysis of cellular tomography data. In particular we propose to (1) develop techniques for
improved tilt-series alignment that account for rigid-body motion of the sample and recover the anisotropic
effects of radiation-induced warping by using optical flow alignment; (2) develop a decoder that leverages the
full frequency information contained in randomly oriented macromolecules in the cell volume to constrain the
effects of the missing-wedge; and (3) improve the resolution of subtomograms extracted from the refined volume
by developing a volume-encoder--deformation-decoder deep neural network to model conformational
heterogeneity. By developing new data-driven methods that constrain the missing-wedge information and treat
shape variability as a continuum of non-rigid deformations rather than discrete clusters, our algorithmic
framework will provide significant improvements in the resolution and quality of reconstructions over currently
existing methods for data analysis that neglect these effects. As the structural biology community is increasingly
focusing on cellular tomography, there is a growing need for easy to use, automated software amenable to both
experienced and novice users. (4) To this end, algorithms resulting from this proposal will be turned into GPU-
enabled open-source user-friendly software to accelerate the analysis of the growing pool of imaging data.
Ultimately, our algorithmic framework will be capable of yielding high-resolution structures from noisy,
incomplete and complex data, thereby enhancing the predictive power of cellular tomography to answer
important biological questions."
10894901,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is projected to become the 2nd leading cause of cancer-related deaths
world-wide by 2030, largely due a lack of effective treatments. A major barrier to successful therapy is the
abundant fibrotic reaction in PDA, which includes cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). While many pancreatic
tumors are hypovascularized, endothelial cells regulate immune maturation and infiltration, tumor cell
metabolism, and metastatic dissemination. In PDA, Hedgehog (HH) signaling functions in a paracrine manner,
whereby tumor cells produce HH ligands and signal to CAFs via the canonical HH receptor PTCH1, leading to
downstream pathway activation. There have been contradictory genetic and pharmacologic studies in mouse
models, as well as disappointing clinical trials with HH pathway inhibitors, indicating the role of HH signaling in
PDA is highly complex and context dependent. This proposal aims to uncover two key aspects of HH signaling
in PDA: a) HH-dependent alterations in the immune landscape through fibroblast-immune cross talk (Aim 1),
and b) HH-dependent changes in endothelial cell gene expression and function through fibroblast-endothelial
cross talk (Aim 2). I hypothesize that combined targeting of HH signaling in combination with the immune
response or the vasculature will be required to effectively treat PDA. Our preliminary data indicate that Slit2,
which regulates angiogenesis, is reduced during HH pathway inhibition in PDA. Previous work showed that
epithelial Slit2 deletion promotes neural invasion and metastasis in PDA. However, I find the majority of Slit2 is
produced by fibroblasts, while Robo receptors are expressed in endothelial cells. In Aim 3 of this proposal, I will
determine the fibroblast-specific contribution of Slit2 to pancreatic angiogenesis and tumor growth. Overall, the
proposed experiments will provide a fundamentally new understanding of cellular cross talk within the
pancreatic TME, including addressing fibroblast-immune and fibroblast-endothelial communication as
well as a specific investigation of SLIT-ROBO signaling in pancreatic cancer. The mentored phase of this
award will be overseen by Drs. Allen and Pasca di Magliano at the University of Michigan (UM). I have developed
an additional advisory team to include internationally known leaders in the fields of cancer biology (Dr. Andrzej
Dlugosz), endothelial biology (Dr. Jason Spence), and immunology (Dr. Bethany Moore). Combined, this
mentorship team has set forth a career development plan focused on research, collaboration, presentations,
mentorship, grantsmanship, and the furthering of management skills required to successfully lead an
independent research laboratory."
10897086,"This is a competitive renewal application for continued T32 award funding to support a Multidisciplinary
Training Program in Pulmonary and Critical Care Research at the University of Utah School of Medicine.
The overall goal of this Training Program is to help develop the next generation of MD and PhD scientists to
advance our knowledge of disease processes in the broad arena of pulmonary and critical care medicine, and
to translate this knowledge to care of our patients. This Training Program has been very successful to date;
the great majority of our trainees have excellent publication records, have advanced into active research
careers in academic medicine, and most have obtained funding to support their research. These trainees
include both MD and PhD investigators, addressing questions in basic and clinical research. The Program
faculty for this training program consists of 15 successful scientists drawn from a range of disciplines, including
cell and molecular biology, quantitative research and modeling, outcomes research and human genetics; all
have a strong history of training young investigators and are involved in collaborative translational and cross-
disciplinary research projects. We propose continued support of 4 trainee positions (MD or PhD) for post-
doctoral training, with a minimum of 2 years in the training program. Trainees are recruited from the fellowship
program in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine or from the research programs of individual mentors; they
may elect either a basic research or clinical research pathway. Key components of the Training Program
include a mentored individual research project, didactic courses relevant to the trainee’s chosen field and
courses and experiences intended to broaden the trainee’s research perspective. Trainees on the clinical
research pathway typically enroll in a Master of Science in Clinical Investigation degree program. All trainees
will take courses to enhance opportunities for long-term success in a research career (Scientific Writing, Grant
Writing), in the Responsible Conduct of Research and to enhance Rigor and Reproducibility in research. An
important priority for this program is to prepare trainees to function within multidisciplinary teams. Therefore, a
central feature of the Program is the use of individual mentorship committees composed of the mentor, and
both basic and clinical researchers. These committees will continually expose the trainees to multidisciplinary
approaches to key problems, encouraging trainees to look beyond the home discipline of their projects. Based
on the special institutional strengths at the University of Utah trainees, will have extensive opportunities to
develop useful competencies in genetics, biomedical informatics, nanotechnology, geriatrics and
environmental contributions to lung disease. This ongoing program will equip young scientists to pursue future
investigations in pulmonary and critical care medicine, with emphasis on translational science flowing from
mechanistic discoveries and multidisciplinary approaches."
10923809,"Abstract/Project Summary:
Epilepsy is one of the oldest, common, neurological disorders known to mankind, contributing
approximately 0.5% to the total global burden of disease. The majority of affected individuals
(>80%) live in low resource settings such as is found in Uganda, with the poor most at risk in view
of their high exposure to other co-existing conditions associated with epilepsy, as well as
limitations in accessing appropriate care. Only an estimated 1 in 5 PWE in sub Saharan Africa
(SSA) are able to access the appropriate treatment of epilepsy with anti-seizure medications. The
combination of challenges in accessing appropriate care, with practically universal discrimination
and stigma associated with epilepsy, has led to subsequently high levels of preventable disability,
social exclusion, and negative mental health outcomes in people with epilepsy (PWE). Almost a
half of PWE are burdened with other coexisting medical conditions that worsen their quality of life,
impact on the mental, physical, social and emotional development and general wellbeing.
Therefore, achievement of Universal Health Coverage and the Sustainable Development Goals
will be elusive without concerted efforts to prioritize epilepsy in national public health agendas
through sustained and coordinated action. The long-term aim of the proposed international
collaborative effort is to reduce the public health burden and the impact of epilepsy stigma in
Uganda so as to yield innovative, transferable knowledge and care gains. Our preliminary work
has engaged a randomly selected national community cohort, 732 of which are probable PWE.
In our initial aim we will utilize a cross sectional comparable design to clinically characterize this
sample and matched controls to inform our understanding of the manifestation and impact of
epilepsy across the lifespan in Uganda. Characterization will include: ILAE classification epilepsy
subtype, seizure frequency and severity, and illness duration. Environmental (birth injuries,
malnutrition) and genetic risk factors will be explored. Comorbidities will include primarily
psychiatric and psychosocial outcomes (depression, suicidality, anxiety, Quality of life (QOL), and
perceived stigma) but will also include key health comorbidities (burns, developmental disorders,
and neurocognitive deficits). Finally, academic progress and occupational engagement will be
ascertained. In the second aim, using a mixed-methods approach we will define the impact of
stigma on the highly vulnerable adolescent with epilepsy (AWE) population, and also expose the
key drivers of stigma in the community. Further clarification will be made to explain how
community misconceptions about epilepsy interact with specific patient characteristics and
impacts to increase risk for or mitigate stigma, which in turn impact QOL outcomes.
Finally, employing an innovative blend of scientific and change management principles we will
engage a targeted community of AWE and their caregivers to co-create, pilot, refine, and test
unique stigma reduction programs. Through various meetings with relevant national and
community stakeholders we will identify community values, resources, and networks. Through
sharing of information and perspectives, proposed stigma reduction programs which resonate
with the priorities and culture of the community will be generated. After vetting to select the most
promising use of resources, programs will be piloted, refined, and formally implemented and
evaluated."
10919172,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most lethal gynecological cancer.
The etiology of ovarian HGSC is largely unknown. Although recent studies (including ours) have identified the
fallopian tube epithelial cell (FTECs) as a cell-of-origin of ovarian HGSC, the exact molecular mechanism(s)
underlying initiation of HGSC from FTECs are still unclear. In the first funded period, our research results provide
solid evidence that the disruption of the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway plays a critical role in the malignant
transformation of immortalized FTECs and the development of HGSC from the immortalized fallopian tube and
ovarian epithelial cells. Despite these findings, we found that it is challenging to induce HGSC from mouse
oviduct epithelium by cell-specific expression of hyperactivated YAP1. Our mechanistic studies, unexpectedly,
demonstrated that hyperactivation of YAP1 alone in the cultured primary FTEC induced cellular senescence.
This surprising finding suggested that other factors likely prevent FTECs from YAP1-induced senescence during
the malignant transformation process. The factor(s) that aid hyperactivated YAP1 in the induction of malignant
transformation of FTECs are unknown. Our large-scale screening studies showed that infection of human
papillomavirus (HPV) was sufficient to prevent cultured primary FTECs from hyperactivated YAP1-induced
senescence. Consistently, our previous studies have shown that HPV16 E6 oncoprotein suppressed the Hippo
pathway and stabilized YAP1 protein to promote the oncogenic action of YAP1. Intriguingly, our preliminary
studies demonstrated that YAP1 facilitated HPV infection of cultured FTECs by increasing the expression of
HPV receptor molecules and suppressing the innate immunity. Importantly HPV virions could reach FTECs under
both physiological (sperm-transmission) and pathological (via retrograde menstruation) conditions. Based on the
above evidence, we hypothesize that hyperactivated YAP1, via upregulating the putative HPV receptor
molecules and suppressing the innate immunity, employs HPV to overcome oncogene-induced senescence and
forms a YAP1-HPV oncogenic alliance to drive the initiation of HGSC in fallopian tube epithelium. In this project,
we designed three specific aims to test our hypothesis. In specific aim 1, we will model the carcinogenic action
of the YAP1-HPV alliance in fallopian tube epithelial cells using unique transgenic animal models and newly
isolated mouse papillomavirus (MmuPV1). In specific aim 2, we designed experiments to reveal the molecular
mechanism(s) by which the YAP1-HPV alliance drives fallopian tube carcinogenesis. In specific aim 3, we
designed preclinical studies to evaluate the potential clinical applications of combined targeting HPV and YAP1
in the prevention and early detection of HGSC-derived from FTECs. Achieving the proposed studies could
identify HPV as a neglected preventable risk factor for ovarian cancer. Identification of the functioning
mechanism (s) of the YAP1-HPV oncogenic axis in the carcinogenesis of fallopian tube epithelium will provide
new clues for developing strategies to improve the prevention and early detection of FTEC-derived HGSC."
10907631,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Brief motivational interventions (BMIs) to reduce risky drinking in college students are well established, but the
needs of emerging adult (EA) risky drinkers who live in disadvantaged communities and are not fulltime college
students have been neglected. They tend to have more constrained access to rewarding opportunities, adult
roles, and activities that present pro-social alternatives to heavy drinking. When coupled with the foreshortened
time horizons typical of many EAs, this suggests the need for interventions that not only enhance motivation to
reduce drinking, but guide EAs to engage in alternatives to heavy drinking and orient their behavior toward
longer-term positive goals. Guided by behavioral economics (BE), the proposed study will disseminate and
evaluate a brief motivational BE intervention that combines BMI elements with the Substance Free Activity
Session shown to reduce drinking by increasing future orientation and engagement in pro-social alternatives.
The intervention will be delivered using a digital platform appropriate for EAs whose social networks operate
through such communications. Because peers influence substance use, a peer-driven sampling method
(Respondent Driven Sampling [RDS]) will be used to recruit 500 community-dwelling EAs ages 18-28 for a
cluster randomized controlled trial that compares the intervention with an educational/assessment control
condition. Drinking practices and problems, BE outcome predictors, and social networks will be assessed at
baseline and at 1, 6, and 12-month follow-ups. Intervention efficacy and behavior change mechanisms will be
examined. Reduced alcohol demand and delay discounting and favorable post-intervention shifts in future
orientation, substance-free vs. substance-involved activities, and use of protective behavioral strategies to
reduce drinking-related harms are predicted to mediate intervention effects. Social network analysis will assess
whether the intervention attenuates network promotion of individual drinking. The study will be the first to test a
web-based alcohol reduction intervention focused on BE principles and to use digital RDS to reach community-
dwelling EAs for intervention. The study will translate and test BE mediators and moderators of change, and
the digital intervention has high potential for reach and scalability with under-served community risk groups."

Vaccines represent a highly effective public health measure to protect individuals from infectious diseases. Many
vaccines work by inducing antigen-specific antibodies that neutralize the pathogen or its products and promote
their clearance. Vaccines based on protein antigens usually require the addition of adjuvants to enhance
potency, breadth and duration of the antigen-specific adaptive immune response. Adjuvants promote vaccine
antigen immunogenicity by activating receptors of the innate immune system called pattern-recognition receptors
(PRRs) and/or modulating antigen pharmacokinetics. Aluminum salts are the most common adjuvants in FDA-
approved vaccines. Recently, vaccines including adjuvants that target specific PRRs, in particular toll-like
receptor (TLR)4 and TLR9, have also been approved by the FDA, paving the way for the development of
molecularly defined adjuvants. Investigating the potential of additional PRRs as adjuvant targets is of paramount
important to expand our vaccine toolbox and probe how different modalities of innate immune cell activation
impact the adaptive immune response. Here, we propose to use the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Spike protein as a model antigen to test a new adjuvant formulation that contains
fungal ligands that target the PRR Dectin-2. Our preliminary results show that mannans (fungal cell wall
polysaccharides isolated from Candia albicans) alone or formulated with aluminum hydroxide enhance the
immunogenicity of pre-fusion stabilized, Spike trimers in mouse models of immunization. In particular, mannan
formulations, compared to aluminum hydroxide only, induce an early increase in anti-Spike antibody levels,
potentiate the induction of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, broaden the Spike epitopes that are targeted
and favor the switch towards immunoglobulin subclasses associated with higher effector functions and reduced
risk of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD). Here we hypothesize that mannans
formulated with alumOH induce a potent and durable adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 Spike
by inducing specific innate immune pathways and activation programs. By combining detailed
immunogenicity and mechanistic analyses, our proposal will define a novel adjuvant formulation for
SARS-CoV-2 Spike and potentially other viral glycoproteins as well as shed new light on the biology of
Dectin-2."
10917209,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) in rodents and humans has a high capacity to oxidize nutrients and convert nutrient-
derived energy into heat. During cold exposure or pharmacologic stimulation of β3-adrenergic receptor (β3AR),
BAT takes up large amounts of diverse substrates (e.g. fatty acids, glucose and amino acids) from the circulation.
However, it remains elusive how BAT orchestrates metabolic utilization of various substrates for heat production.
The goal of this project is to elucidate the mechanism that coordinates complex substrate utilization in BAT in
response to cold or β3AR stimulation. The malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS), which is composed of cytosolic and
mitochondrial enzymes GOT1/2 and MDH1/2, is a biochemical system that facilitates the net transfer of cytosolic
NADH produced in glycolysis to the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) while regenerating NAD+ in the
cytosol to maintain glycolysis. For this transfer, the MAS utilizes a subset of amino acids and metabolites as
shuttling substrates. In the preliminary study, we found that, unlike in other tissues, Got1 expression is very low
in BAT. However, cold exposure or pharmacological β3-adrenergic agonism markedly induces Got1 expression
in BAT while other enzymes remain unchanged. Our preliminary study provides strong evidence for GOT1-
dependent MAS activation and its impact on substrate utilization in BAT: i) Got1 overexpression in brown
adipocytes increases cytosolic NADH oxidation along with an increase in mitochondrial respiration; ii) Transgenic
overexpression of Got1 in BAT increases energy expenditure and improves cold tolerance in mice; and iii)
Surprisingly, Got1 overexpression in BAT enhances fatty acid oxidation while Got1 deletion leads to a decline in
cold-stimulated FA oxidation. In this project, we will test the hypothesis that cold-induced GOT1 acts as a
molecular switch turning on the MAS, which in turn serves as a mechanism to coordinate cold-stimulated
glycolysis, substrate shuttling, and FA oxidation in BAT to support thermogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we
will use an integrative approach that combines animal physiology with cell and molecular techniques. In Aim 1,
we will define the role of GOT1 in MAS activation by using stable isotope tracing, NADH biosensor Peredox, and
high-resolution respirometry. In Aim 2, we will elucidate the mechanism by which GOT1 enhances fatty acid
oxidation. In Aim 3, we will delineate the mechanism by which β3AR signaling increases GOT1 activity. The study
outcomes will identify GOT1 as a critical node that links cold-stimulated β3AR signaling to the MAS, which
coordinates glycolysis, amino acid utilization, and FA oxidation in BAT in response to cold."
10877096,"Project Summary
It is now well accepted that epigenetic and metabolic factors are major drivers of tumorigenesis and the link
between the two pathways will be central in cancer therapy. The intimate connection between epigenetics and
metabolism is most readily realized by the cofactors for epigenetic modifiers being key inputs and products for
metabolic pathways. Acetyl coenzyme A, in addition to its role in oxidative phosphorylation, is the source of
acetate used by histone acetyltransferases. S-adenosyl methionine, produced by the folate and methionine
metabolic pathways, is the donor for histone and DNA methylation. Alpha ketoglutarate, a TCA cycle metabolite,
is a cofactor for histone demethylases of the Jumonji and LSD families, as well as for the ten-eleven translocase
(TET) Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase family that is involved in DNA demethylation. A direct link between the
metabolic and epigenetic pathways in cancer was the identification of mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenases
IDH1 and IDH2 in myeloid malignancies, which also frequently exhibits TET2 mutations. The IDH mutations were
found to be gain-of-function mutations, converting alpha ketoglutarate to D(R)-2-hydroxyglutarate, which inhibits
the TET enzymes. Based on the deep relationship of epigenetics and metabolism in tumorigenesis and the
growing number of methods to investigate these processes, we propose to create a timely, rigorous, and state-
of-the-art training program at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine to allow postdoctoral fellows
to gain the knowledge and skills to develop their own productive cancer research programs. The program will
introduce innovative courses combining classwork and lab work in epigenetics, metabolism, and related data
analysis skills. Trainees will have an individual training plan, which will include co-mentors to fully cover the
broad expertise needed for carrying out projects that bridge epigenetics and metabolism. Additionally,
outstanding investigators, hosted by trainees, will be brought to Northwestern Medicine throughout the year
covering topics in epigenetics and metabolism. An annual research day will be joined by internal and external
advisory members to monitor and advise to ensure the success of this training program. Although trainees will
only be supported by the training grant for two years, we strongly encourage all graduates of the training grant
to continue to participate in many of these activities throughout their postdoctoral career. Based on the strong
investment of Northwestern University into epigenetics and metabolism, the track record of the program's
preceptors, and the institutional investments in this program, there is great potential for facilitating the
development of outstanding future investigators in cancer epigenetics and metabolism."

Support is requested for a training program in microbial pathogenesis and immunology at Oregon Health &
Science University (OHSU). This interdisciplinary area of research requires a cadre of interactive faculty with
diverse expertise to recruit and train young scientists in all modern aspects of host-microbial interactions.
Funds are requested for the support of 4 predoctoral and 2 postdoctoral trainees. The participating faculty
consists of 27 members of OHSU that were selected among a pool of more than 50 available faculty based on
the criteria explained in the application. Many of these investigators have primary or secondary appointments
in the Department of Molecular Microbiology & Immunology, Department of Medicine, in the School of
Dentistry, Biomedical Engineering, and Cell Development and Cancer Biology, and the Vaccine and Gene
Therapy Institute. Thus, the necessary infrastructure in which diverse basic scientists and physician-scientists
with common interests can collaborate to provide training opportunities in basic and translational research is
established. The broad research programs of the participating faculty include the use of a number of vertebrate
and invertebrate model hosts, the use of genetic and genomic technologies to study microbial pathogenesis
and immunology, and the study of the influence of the immune system on susceptibility to infections and
inflammatory disorders. In addition to an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms underlying host-pathogen
interactions, the training program will offer innovative research experiences that take advantage of state-of-the-
art technologies and numerous career-enhancing opportunities. The primary focus of this proposal remains the
training of the next generation of scientists with an interest in microbial pathogenesis and immunology;
however, there is an increasing necessity to provide training in alternative careers that will be addressed
herein. Our trainees will also have the unique opportunity to obtain direct clinical experiences through the
Infectious Disease Internship Program. OHSU has a number of outreach programs for underrepresented
minorities that will be used to recruit a diverse group of trainees. Unfortunately, we lack a formal training
mechanism for our existing predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees interested in the study of microbial
pathogenesis and immunology. This training grant will help to rectify this situation and further enhance
microbiology and immunology at OHSU by providing a vibrant research community with the needed
infrastructure to train predoctoral and postdoctoral students in this area of research."
10886726,"PROJECT SUMMARY
HIV-1 has a low transmission rate and most new infections via the mucosal route are initiated by a single variant out of a viral quasispecies. Recent studies in non-human primates found that mucosal transmission foci contain infected dendritic cells, and it remains to be determined why their innate responses sometimes fail to prevent viral spread. Selective advantages that allow a virus to cross a recipient's mucosal barrier include the ability to evade restriction factors and suppress innate antiviral responses. Various HIV-1 proteins participate in these evasion tactics, including the viral capsid. After entry, the capsid binds cellular factors necessary for its transit to the nucleus and synthesis of viral DNA, while repelling restriction factors and specialized innate sensors. Over the years, we have studied several innate sensors and, most recently, our studies have focused on HIV-1- dependent activation of cyclic GAMP synthase (cGAS), a cytosolic DNA sensor. We discovered that polyglutamine binding protein 1 (PQBP1) is an adaptor required for cGAS sensing of HIV-1 DNA. PQBP1 binds to the HIV-1 capsid, thereby authenticating it as a danger signal, then recruits cGAS to the capsid as it begins to disassemble and reveal the nascent viral DNA. We assume that PQBP1 transfers cGAS to the emerging DNA by a ""bait and switch"" mechanism, resulting in cGAS activation and downstream gene expression. We identified both naturally occurring and genetically engineered capsid variants that activate cGAS to different levels, suggesting that capsid structure is a key determinant of this innate pathway. A critical gap in our knowledge that will be addressed by this project is how PQBP1-capsid interactions and molecular rearrangements control the strength of the cGAS signal (Aims 1 and 2). The cGAS pathway is predominanUy responsible for innate immune responses triggered by HIV-1 infection of dendritic cells, resulting in expression of antiviral factors and type I interferons as well as proinflammatory cytokines. Paradoxically, while induction of antiviral genes inhibits replication, proinflammatory cytokines can activate resting CD4+ T cells and may promote infection. We hypothesize that the strength of the cGAS signal activated by HIV-1 can tip the balance from antiviral to proinflammatory responses, thereby contributing to successful transmission. The same mechanism may also be activated in other lymphoid tissues, downstream of the initial transmission event, and may determine the course of reservoir seeding. Another critical gap in our knowledge that will be addressed by this project is how the level of cGAS activation drives the balance between antiviral and proinflammatory responses and the role of the HIV- 1 capsid in determining its magnitude, both in vitro and in vivo (Aim 3). Our findings will provide insight into the molecular events that determine the outcome of viral exposure, and these same mechanisms could also contribute to HIV-1 pathogenesis. Additionally, our findings will provide important guidance for the design of appropriate adjuvant and vaccine strategies for HIV-1 and other pathologies that involve the cGAS pathway."

Research over the past two decades has led to the discovery of mutations that cause rare autoinflammatory
diseases and advanced our understanding of common autoimmune diseases. Further, the understanding of the
complex mechanisms underlying autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases has also expanded at a rapid
pace. We now have a better understanding of the interplay between key components of innate and adaptive
immune systems and the pathways involved. These advances were driven by improvements in sequencing
technologies, single-cell genomic approaches, spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and high-
resolution imaging. Additionally, improved animal models of human disease, innovative stem cell and organoid
systems, and a new appreciation for the microbiome's influence on immune reactivity have fueled progress.
These discoveries provide a framework for identifying new targets to treat a wide range of autoimmune and
inflammatory diseases. Despite these advances, immune-mediated diseases are reaching epidemic proportions.
To address this emerging health crisis, we must train the next generation of scientists to capitalize on these
insights and develop novel therapeutic strategies for autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases.
The Training in the Molecular Basis of Autoimmunity and Autoinflammation (AATG) T32 prepares predoctoral
students to become future scientific leaders by providing a strong foundation in the basic principles of innate and
adaptive immunity. The AATG program brings together 34 investigators from ten departments, representing a
broad spectrum of research backgrounds and expertise, ranging from basic research to drug discovery, who are
engaged in basic and translational, disease-oriented research focusing on autoimmune/autoinflammatory
conditions.
challenging
Our faculty are either current or up-and-coming leaders in their fields, which will foster intellectually
discourse, a firm understanding and working knowledge of the principles and applications of cutting-
edge research technologies, and exciting thesis research. The goal is to provide our trainees with the skill set to
succeed as independent and creative investigators in the constantly evolving world of biomedical research.
The AATG provides predoctoral students with critical career skills to effectively communicate their discoveries,
and students will be strongly encouraged to participate in regional, national and international meetings. The
training curriculum will also emphasize scientific rigor, methods for appropriate data management/analysis/
validation, biosafety, conflict resolution, and ethical conduct. The AATG physician-scientists will enable our
trainees to engage with leaders in adjacent clinical sites to better understand the diseases we hope to cure. The
AATG faculty further serve as role models and provide attractive opportunities for women, economically
disadvantaged and underrepresented minorities to encourage the pursuit of careers in basic scientific research.
These goals will help meet future challenges and societal needs in biomedical research."

Approximately 66,000 individuals will be diagnosed with head and neck cancer (HNC) in the United States (US)
in 2022. Most patients with HNC are treated aggressively with multi-modal therapies that have improved survival
but at a human cost of substantial symptom burden, decreased health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and
extensive acute care use. Symptom management for patients with HNC is critical. However, up to 50% of
patients' symptoms go undetected and electronic health records (EHR) documentation of symptoms is
incomplete. Ground-breaking research shows patient-reported symptom (PRO) monitoring during cancer care
is associated with improved symptom control, decreased acute care use, and longer survival. Yet, a closer
investigation of the literature finds the effects of PROs on cancer outcomes vary depending on implementation.
Reasons for variations in PRO implementation include limited integration with electronic health records (EHR),
inequality in access, and lack of standardized approaches, creating barriers to widespread implementation of
PROs. We developed the NYU Electronic Patient Visit Assessment (ePVA) for HNC as a valid, reliable PRO
that has evolved into a clinical support tool for early detection of uncontrolled symptoms. The ePVA provides a
global picture of the patient's condition automated to clinicians at point-of-care, enabling real-time interventions.
We completed a pilot randomized clinical trial of the ePVA in 32 patients with HNC undergoing radiation therapy
(RT) with or without chemotherapy, and found those assigned to the ePVA+Usual Care Arm reported significantly
less severe HNC symptoms (p<.05) and acute care use (p<.001) than those assigned to the Usual Care Arm.
Our objective in this proposal is to identify implementation strategies optimizing the effectiveness of the ePVA to
improve HNC outcomes in real-world settings and explore integrating the ePVA with the EHR architecture for
scalability and equality in access. To achieve this objective, we will conduct a mixed methods hybrid type I study
at three National Cancer Institute-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers serving diverse populations in
rural and urban settings (New York University, University of Kansas Cancer Center, Fox Chase Cancer Center)
using the RE-AIM framework. For participants with HNC undergoing RT with or without chemotherapy, the
specific aims are: 1) (Quantitative) Determine the effect of the Electronic Patient Visit Assessment (ePVA) on
HNC symptoms (primary outcomes), pain, HRQoL, and acute care use (secondary outcomes) in a two-arm
(usual care vs. ePVA+usual care) multisite randomized clinical trial (n=270); 2) (Qualitative) Examine HNC
patients’ and clinicians’ perspectives on patient, clinician, and organization facilitators and barriers to the ePVA’s
reach, adoption, effectiveness, and maintenance; 3) (Integrated) Identify implementation strategies optimizing
ePVA’s reach, adoption, effectiveness, and maintenance; Exploratory Aim: Explore the usability of the integration
of ePVA with EHR systems (n=30). The long-term goal of this research is to identify implementation and
technology standards for effective, widespread use of the ePVA that apply to all PROs in cancer care."
10703280,"Breast cancer (BC), the most common cancer among military servicewomen than in the general population. This
makes BC a critical concern for female Veterans and VA health care. VA women has an increased risk of BC
due to service-related exposures. Women diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) have a more
aggressive clinical course, a higher propensity for metastases, and a worse outcome. Therefore, development
of novel therapeutic strategies represents a clear unmet need. Genome instability is a hallmark of cancer and
DNA replication represents one of the most vulnerable cellular processes that dysfunction therein leads to
genome instability in cancer cells. Topoisomerase inhibitors (TIs) are shown to enhance replication stress (RS),
and several TIs are approved by FDA for TNBC therapy. However, clinical utility is limited by toxicity and the
development of resistance. Therefore, understanding the molecular basis of RS and DNA repair will provide the
requisite foundation to develop new therapeutic targets and combination therapies. Proline-, glutamic acid-, and
leucine-rich protein 1 (PELP1) plays a critical role in TNBC progression. PELP1 status is a prognostic indicator
of poor BC survival. There is a major knowledge gap regarding the mechanisms by which PELP1 contribute to
cancer progression. We have developed a first-in-class inhibitor of PELP1 (SMIP34) that has activity on TNBCs
and preliminary studies suggested SMIP34 enhance the utility of TIs in treating TNBC. The Objective of this
proposal is to define the molecular mechanism of action of PELP1 in RS, DNA repair and to pave the path for a
novel combination therapy. Our overarching hypothesis is that PELP1 signaling in DNA repair represents an
attractive therapeutic target for SMIP34 in combination with TI in TNBC. In Aim 1, we will define the mechanisms
by which PELP1 promotes DNA repair, determine the role of PELP1 in RS mediated DNA damage and identify
PELP1 interactome under conditions of DNA damage. In Aim 2, we will characterize the role of PELP1
interactions with topoisomerases, establish the biological activity of SMIP34+TI combination therapy using
multiple TNBC models and determine the mechanisms by which SMIP34 enhances efficacy of topoisomerase
inhibitor. In Aim3, we will test the utility of SMIP34 + TI combination therapy in treating TNBC using orthotopic
xenograft models, determine its utility in reducing TNBC metastases and establish the translatability of SMIP34
+ TI therapy in treating TNBC using organoids (PDOs) and patient derived xenografts (PDX). This proposal
tests the novel concept that SMIP34 blocks oncogenic DNA repair pathways which plays a critical role in TNBC
progression leading to therapy resistance; and that disruption of PELP1 signaling with SMIP34 will enhance
therapeutic effect of currently FDA approved chemotherapy using TI. Successful completion of the proposed
studies will lead to the development of novel SMIP34+TI combination therapy that addresses the critical need of
targeting TNBC. This research program is significant as it is expected to establish a novel targeted therapy
critical to the treatment or prevention of TNBC in Veteran population."
10918267,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive cancer with limited treatment options
that has a five-year survival rate of <10%. PDAC progression is associated with dysregulated tumor and whole-
body metabolism that impacts therapy and quality of life, which has motivated research on how to best exploit
metabolic dependencies in PDAC for better cancer treatment. Nutrient utilization by cancer cells is regulated in
part by the availability of metabolites in the environment, and the PDAC tumor microenvironment in particular is
highly desmoplastic, consisting of stromal cells, extracellular matrix, and nutrient-poor interstitial fluid. These
microenvironmental factors can impact therapy response, suggesting that the efficacies of metabolism-targeted
drugs can be improved by manipulating components of the PDAC tumor microenvironment. One determinant of
metabolite levels in the tumor microenvironment is diet, and how diet affects cancer progression and treatment
is an important question for many patients. Since dietary recommendations to patients must be made in the
context of therapies being received, the value of any dietary intervention likely lies in its ability to enhance tumor
responses to cancer therapies. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that drive synergistic interactions
between diet and cancer therapies is critical for the translation of dietary recommendations into patient care.
 The main objective of this proposal is to identify dietary interventions that synergize with cancer therapies
to impair PDAC progression. Mouse PDAC models will be used to examine how different diets enhance the
efficacies of standard-of-care FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy (Aim 1), lipid metabolism inhibitors in development
for cancer treatment (Aim 2), and inducers of ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic form of cell death being explored for
PDAC treatment (Aim 3). Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics and lipidomics, stable isotope nutrient tracing,
and RNA sequencing will be used to determine how diet-mediated changes to nutrient levels in the tumor
microenvironment alter the metabolism of PDAC tumors to shape their responses to these therapies. Elucidating
the metabolic mechanisms that underlie synergistic diet-drug combinations will provide scientific evidence that
can benefit patients with guidance on how to best incorporate diet and nutrition into cancer therapy.
 The proposed training plan will help me transition into an independent academic position. A team of
outstanding scientists will mentor me to help me achieve this goal: Dr. Tyler Jacks, a leader in mouse cancer
models; Dr. Omer Yilmaz, a leader in dietary effects on cancer progression; Dr. Caroline Lewis, a leader in mass
spectrometry-based metabolomics and lipidomics technologies; and Dr. Brian Wolpin, a leader in PDAC
epidemiology. My training plan also outlines activities that will help me cultivate mentors, improve my scientific
skillset, improve science communication skills, develop teaching and mentoring skills, build my network, and
learn lab management skills. Together, the research proposal and career development plan will provide me with
the expertise needed to become a successful independent investigator and educator in the cancer biology field."

 Extremity trauma involving large tissue loss presents a significant clinical challenge for both general and military
populations. When these injuries involve Volumetric Muscle Loss (VML), the current gold standard surgery is treatment
with muscle flap autografts or free tissue transfer. However, these result in significant fibrosis and fatty infiltration, impaired
regeneration, chronic pain, and significant long-term functional disabilities. There is currently a fundamental lack of
understanding of the molecular and cellular processes in the hostile environment of a full thickness, critically sized VML
defect which leads to the fibrotic and poor healing outcomes regardless of the treatment approach. In a series of recent
publications in pre-clinical VML models, our group has defined the critical size threshold above which the characteristic
VML hallmarks are observed: fibrosis and fatty infiltration, chronic inflammation, and lack of myofiber bridging across the
defect. We now present preliminary evidence that there is a distinct and dysregulated cellular response in the critically sized
defect with rapid proliferation of fibro-adipogenic progenitor cells (FAPs). FAPs are a dynamic mesenchymal stromal cells
that play a critical support and coordination role for muscle stem cells, also known as satellite cells (MuSCs), during
regeneration; however, in chronic muscle pathologies, like muscular dystrophies, FAPs can differentiate into fibrotic and
adipogenic lineages in a process that is thought to be directed by macrophages and specific subsets of M2 macrophages.
The overall objective of this proposal is to regenerate functional muscle after VML by engineering an immunomodulatory
biomaterial system to direct the FAPs towards a pro-regenerative state, thus creating an environmental niche conducive to
MuSCs transplantation and muscle regeneration. Our central hypothesis posits that following VML injury, local FAPs
undergo a transition to an aberrant phenotype that directly differentiates into fibrotic and fatty tissue and that controlled
delivery of pro-resolving lipid mediators will resolve these FAPs and restore the regenerative potential of MuSCs. We
propose the following aims: Aim 1: To determine the role of aberrant FAPs in fatty infiltration and fibrosis associated with
VML injuries. Aim 2: To assess the contribution of increased pro-fibrotic signaling of M2 polarized macrophages on FAPs
function in VML. Aim 3: To test whether co-delivery of pro-regenerative FAPs and MuSC within PEG-4MAL hydrogel
enhance muscle regeneration and functional recovery following VML. Impact – VML is a pervasive clinical challenge with
poor functional outcomes even after gold standard autograft treatment. We will define the critical roles of immune and FAP
cells in this process and develop newly engineered immunomodulatory and regenerative treatment strategies that will
provide a foundation to translate into clinical treatments for VML."
10898904,"Clinical/Translational (C/T) scientists who conceptualize health problems in new ways and utilize skills that
both enhance interdisciplinary work in clinical and community settings and catalyze translational processes are
vital to address the nation’s unmet health needs and achieve equity in health care. Building upon the
successes of our existing C/T training programs for predoctoral students, post-doctorates, and junior faculty,
and in collaboration with the Workforce Development and Community & Stakeholder Engagement Modules of
our Clinical & Translational Science Collaborative, our Clinical and Translational Scientist Training Program for
Post-doctorates (CTSTP-Post) will enable a diverse cadre of postdoctoral trainees to both ‘deepen’ their
scientific domain expertise and develop the knowledge, perspective, and skills necessary to function efficiently
and effectively as C/T scientists facing the opportunities and challenges of medicine and health in the 21st
Century. We will also increase diversity in trainees and create a research environment welcoming to that
diversity. Strategic partnership with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and other targeted
institutions will increase the number of underrepresented minorities, persons with disabilities, and persons from
disadvantaged backgrounds in our training program and, ultimately, into the C/T Science workforce. Through
this program, twelve trainees will each complete a two-year appointment. Using a strategic combination of
training activities – e.g., mentoring by a successful, experienced C/T scientist, coursework, observerships and
other field experiences, workshops, symposiums, seminars/discussions – trainees will acquire deeper
understanding of and sharpen their skills in translational processes, interdisciplinary research, team science,
communication, systems science and complexity, community and stakeholder engagement, innovation,
entrepreneurship and commercialization, dissemination and implementation science, information science and
artificial intelligence, health disparities, professional and leadership development, responsible conduct of
research, and methods for enhancing reproducibility. Our program will interact with the proposed CTSTP for
Predoctoral Students and K12 Program for Junior Faculty, creating a rich culture of learning and exchange,
where perspectives of different disciplines are represented and where trainees share ideas, challenge each
other, and grow together. Although each program will be distinct and will have its own Internal Advisory
(Steering) Committee and unique components, oversight of all three programs by a single Research Education
Advisory Board, a shared mentor pool, strategically selected joint activities, and standardized evaluation

10703720,"Bladder cancer is the most common urinary tract cancer in men. The cumulative effects of smoking and
deployment-related carcinogens in the aging Veteran population play a major role in the pathogenesis of
bladder cancer. The recurring and progressive nature of bladder cancer poses a significant health burden for
Veterans and the Veterans Health Administration. A tendency to relapse and acquire resistance to treatment
is a recurrent theme in all stages of the disease. Epigenetic alterations are widely prevalent in bladder cancer
and are a challenge to target due to the wide-ranging effects of chromatin modifications. We focus on the most
common chromatin alteration in bladder cancer, which is ARID1A gene mutation, and broaden the scope of our
study to address treatment resistance in all bladder cancer. Treatment resistance is linked to the mutation or
deletion of tumor suppressor gene, ARID1A, in early stages. ARID1A gene mutations are present in about a
fourth of bladder cancer, through all stages of the disease, and play a role in bladder cancer stem cell
maintenance, renewal and therapy resistance. ARID1A protein is a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin
remodeling complex. It has a concerted role in controlling cell proliferation, differentiation and protecting the
genome from damage. Targeting loss of this multi-faceted tumor suppressor is a daunting undertaking and
hence, there is currently no specific therapy for ARID1A mutated cancer. We characterize ARID1A mutated
bladder cancer in a multi-omics context, combining gene alterations, protein enrichment and gene expression
changes, and correlating clinical course to identify pathways of treatment resistance. The pathways of
treatment resistance that we have identified in ARID1A mutated bladder cancer are active and prevalent in all
bladder cancer. We have identified specific treatments that are likely to be highly effective in the setting of
treatment resistance. We plan to: 1. Establish the mechanisms of treatment resistance and aggressive disease
biology in all bladder cancer 2. Establish combinations of highly effective treatments to overcome aggressive
treatment-resistant bladder cancer. We use datasets of clinically annotated molecularly sequenced tumors and
archived tissue to validate and consolidate our targets. We have characterized cell lines, patient-derived
tumors, and highly effective precise therapeutic agents to test our hypotheses. We use sophisticated assays to
understand the mechanisms that drive cancer growth and spread. Currently, there is no targeted therapy for
treatment-resistant bladder cancer. Our multi-disciplinary collaboration and innovative multi-omics approach
will lead to a paradigm of effective targeting and provide an enduring treatment outcome for bladder cancer in
Veterans."
10898810,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The US population is becoming more diverse. However, the clinical and translational scientific and professional
workforce is not representative of the US population and the underrepresentation of individuals from diverse
backgrounds in the biomedical workforce hinders scientific discovery and adversely impacts the health of our
nation. The NIH has already made substantial investments in research education programs. However, the
predominant focus of the majority of NIH supported workforce development programs has narrowly focused on
cultivating the next generation of doctorally prepared clinical and translational scientists with minimal attention
to the need for a more inclusive biomedical sciences workforce that also includes underrepresented racial
minorities (URMs) as scientists as well as research professionals who are critical to the production of clinical and
translational science (CTS). To address the need for greater diversity in the CTS workforce, the proposed
program, Intensive Summer Education Program in Translation Research for Underrepresented Students
(INSPIRE-US), entails research education activities that align with the mission of the NIH and Case Western
Reserve University. The proposed program, INSPIRE-US, builds on the institutional commitments of the
University and the Cleveland Translational Science Collaborative, as well as the experience of the MPIs, an
external advisory board, and program faculty who have led similar research education programs and understand
the distinct learning and socioemotional needs of URM undergraduates interested in careers related to CTS.
The INSPIRE-US program is conceptualized as a 10-week research education program that is tailored to the
distinct needs of URM undergraduates. Across the five years of this program, the program leadership aim to
recruit 25 program participants. The specific aims for this application are: (1) Recruit diverse and talented
undergraduates through evidence-informed strategies and collaborative institutional partnerships with 9
historically black colleges and universities and surrounding community colleges; (2) Implement a theory-informed
curriculum with complementary program activities that fosters community building and social support, hands on
research experiences across the clinical and translational science continuum, didactic instruction and micro-
credentialing focused on the fundamental concepts of clinical and translational science, and mentoring and
career coaching activities that aim to promote persistence and the intention to pursue careers in CTS among
program participants; and (3) Evaluate the short- and long-term effects of the INSPIRE-US program on
participants’ career progression, program faculty, and the university. Our INSPIRE-US program leverages best
practices known to promote career interest, research skill development, and the socioemotional support needed
for URM undergraduates to successfully join the CTS workforce. If shown effective, the INSPIRE-US program is
conceptualized to be reproducible and easily integrated into the activities of other Clinical Translational Science
Awards (CTSA)."
10880559,"ABSTRACT
Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) worldwide and
causes irreversible reproductive tract damage in women. As most CT-infected women have no symptoms and
are unaware that they are infected, the CDC recommends annual CT screening in women aged <25 and high
risk women to detect and treat asymptomatic infections and prevent complications; in men, routine screening is
not recommended. Despite 3 decades of screening programs, CT rates in the U.S. have dramatically increased,
driven primarily by increasing CT reinfections. As most CT-infected women are heterosexual and routine
screening in men is not recommended, undetected CT infections in men are the reservoir that propels
reinfections in women. To curb the CT epidemic, it is critical that we understand whether men can develop
immunity to CT and identify factors that promote CT reinfections (e.g., asymptomatic men who shed significant
CT organisms). Approximately 1/3 of men who present for treatment as a CT contact (i.e., their sex partner was
confirmed to be CT-infected) are uninfected, suggesting that these men either cleared CT infection by immune-
mediated mechanisms or have a urethral microbiome that resists CT acquisition. To prevent CT reinfections in
women, this proposal focuses on male contacts to CT-infected women and will study if CT infection is associated
with specific microbiome compositions, comorbid STIs, or adaptive T-cell and antibody immunity. To do this, we
will enroll up to 400 male CT-contacts, collect blood and urine specimens, treat them with the CDC-recommend
first-line antibiotic, and ask them to return for a 1-month test of cure (TOC) visit (Aim 1). To study if CT uninfected
contacts to CT have long-lasting immunity and how the urethral microbiome and immune system change over
time, we will re-enroll 100 men for a 6-month longitudinal study to collect weekly urine specimens and
symptom/sexual behavior diaries and blood and urine specimens at 3-month and 6-month screening visits.
Weekly urine specimens will be stored and tested at study completion to create a natural history study. By
studying the rates of incident CT infection over time, we will be able to elucidate if resistance to CT infection,
defined in Aim 1, correlates with (1) increased rate of natural clearance between visits; (2) decrease in incident
CT infection at 3- or 6-months; (3) decrease in incident CT infection organism load; and (4) decrease in the rate
of homologous CT genovars. Study findings will inform novel approaches to preventing transmission from men
to women and help curb rising CT rates and complications."

Mucins and other densely glycosylated proteins play critical roles in a number of biological processes, disease
conditions, and therapeutics. The functioning of these sugar-coated molecular machines depends on their
structure, dynamics, and conformational transitions. Experimental techniques for capturing such structural
dynamics, however, can be extremely challenging and resource intensive. We seek to improve upon some of
the existing glycan modeling computational tools as well as design new in silico techniques, as robust alternatives
to experimental studies. These tools will be used to build interconnected mucin glycoprotein gel systems with
native glycosylation patterns, and obtain understanding of functional underpinnings at the molecular level. Effects
of perturbations in terms of pH variance, varying glycosylation patterns, and charge distribution changes will be
investigated. This will enable detailed comprehension of the physical properties of mucins that drive their
function, as well as the molecular elucidation of disease conditions of cystic fibrosis, mucosal inflammation, and
mucin-mediated cancers. A multi-modal approach will be employed to study these mucin networks in different
scales – (i) first-principles based atomistic modeling to capture the equilibrium structure-dynamics; (ii)
biophysics-based coarse-grained methods to describe bulk properties and transitions, and (iii) data-driven
machine learning approaches to predict topology and intermolecular interactions. Inspired from mucosal gels,
we will use these tools to design novel mucin-like nanomaterials constructed from glycan-peptide heteropolymer
networks to target different biomedical applications. We aim to optimize a machine learning (ML)-driven
combinatorics method for glycan arrangement in these polymers that will provide enhanced control over material
properties – a molecular LEGO of glycans geared towards customizable mucin-mimetic biomaterials."

Microscopy Cores. Successful execution of the three projects that comprise this P01 are
necessary to test the central hypothesis. Quantification of neocortical network structure (Project
2) and Cl-i and Cl-o (Project 3) must be measured as a function of time after brain injury and
epileptogenesis (Project 1). These projects all utilize the same experimental cohort in order to
reduce costs and animal usage. Thus close coordination among the projects is essential.
Coordination of projects by the Administrative Core greatly facilitates simultaneous data
collection and analysis on the same animals. Experiments and animal enrollment are staggered
across the duration of the grant to minimize space requirements in the vivarium and operating
room and maximize the efficient, continuous utilization of space and personnel.
The Administrative Core will coordinate project meetings. Investigators currently meet monthly
to review results of Phase I of this project (tool development). We plan to continue these
monthly meetings to review progress, address problems, and coordinate research schedules.
Coordination by the Administrative Core is described in this section of the proposal.
The Administrative core will facilitate the interface of the P01 with external scientists and
organizations. In addition to monthly meetings of projects and cores, the Administrative Core
will also organize quarterly meetings with the investigators, consultants and the steering
committee. At these meetings, the overall direction of the research will be reviewed,
manuscripts will be discussed, and presentations at national and international meetings will be
addressed.
The administrative core will facilitate policy management and the execution of both internal and
institutional policies relevant to the project.
The administrative core will manage data transfer between projects, data archiving, and access
to the data by external investigators.
The Administrative Core will coordinate interactions with regulatory agencies, vendors, and
professional organizations."
10928749,"There is a critical need for safe and effective treatment options for persistent obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in
patients with Hypotonic Upper Airway Obstruction (HUAO). HUAO encompass conditions such as cerebral
palsy, hypoxic encephalopathy, syndromic tone anomalies, Trisomy 21 or Down Syndrome, and neuromuscular disorders, and typically share a similar pattern of multisite upper airway collapse. OSA is characterized by recurrent episodes of partial or complete upper airway obstruction during sleep with associated arousals and/ or oxygen desaturations. In contrast to the incidence of OSA among children which is between 1-5%, there is a significantly higher prevalence of OSA among children with hypotonic conditions, cerebral palsy, and Trisomy 21/Down Syndrome. Of hypotonic patients undergoing polysomnography (PSG) for symptoms of sleep disordered breathing, 25% had moderate OSA, and 56.3% had severe OSA. Thus, not only are patients more likely to have OSA, but it is likely to be much more severe. Despite the obvious upper airway collapse seen in most of these patients, there is a paucity of data in literature, both on prevalence and severity of OSA in these conditions, but also on treatment efficacy
particularly with regards to multi-level obstruction and moreover, with duration of treatment efficacy. Currently
available treatment options, ranging from palliative care to tracheostomy, often fail to fully meet the needs of
these patients. Our multidisciplinary team has developed a dramatically effective non-surgical nasopharyngeal
airway stent that has demonstrated good tolerability in hypotonic patients.

Treatment of OSA in HUAO presents an extremely difficult challenge, in part due to diffuse multilevel
obstruction with lack of muscular airway tone. This renders many surgical approaches, other than
tracheostomy, likely to fail. Although surgical options such as adenotonsillectomy are common, most children
with HUAO have residual OSA after the procedure, due to residual anatomic and physiological abnormalities.
This often necessitates attempted treatment with Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) or consideration for
tracheostomy. However, the rate of adherence with PAP in typically developing children can be low, and even
lower in those with hypotonic conditions. Moreover, inability to remove a mask during an emesis can pose a
suffocation risk. Tracheostomy carries associated risks for morbidity and mortality, a substantial addition of
care needs, family burden, nursing demands, and hundreds of thousands of dollars of medical costs.
Our multidisciplinary team, led by Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery, Sleep Medicine, and Engineering,
has designed, developed, and successfully piloted a self-supported nasopharyngeal airway (ssNPA) device
that bypasses challenging, diffuse, multilevel upper airway obstruction. The device has demonstrated initial
safety and preliminary efficacy in a pilot group of patients, severe OSA. The Start-up phase (R61) of the grant
will test an enhanced version of the device for acceptability and tolerability. Critically, insertion, adherence, and
compliance protocols will be optimized for preparation of the R33 phase. The R33 phase will assess a powered
cohort looking at PSG and quality of life outcomes."
10897903,"ABSTRACT:
 In the pursuit of strategies with which to cure HIV-1 infection, most of the attention has been on
mechanisms that govern HIV-1 persistence in CD4+ T cell reservoirs and on approaches to limit persistence in
those reservoirs. We recently provided evidence [1] that macrophages enable viral persistence in HIV-1-infected
individuals on effective ART. We showed that rebound viremia from individuals undergoing an analytic treatment
interruption (ATI) comprised highly macrophage-tropic viruses and we used a novel virion immunocapture
method to demonstrate that those macrophage-tropic viruses in post-ATI plasma had a myeloid cell origin.
Furthermore, Molecular Clock analysis indicated that macrophage-tropic viruses in plasma pre-dated the
treatment interruption as opposed to having been created during the treatment interruption interval.
 Given these lines of evidence that myeloid cells can serve as viral reservoirs under effective ART, we set
about establishing a latency model in primary macrophages. In the pursuit of this model of macrophage latency,
we observed that NF-kB inhibition, originally intended to promote synchronous latency, led to irreversible loss of
proviral competence- proviruses were refractory to latency reactivating agents (LRAs) even though host cell
functions remained intact. On the basis of these observations, we hypothesize that the provirus is epigenetically
modified under conditions where NF-kB is limiting and that sustained transcriptional activity is required to
counteract epigenetic silencing processes of the host cell. In this proposal, we will assess the mechanisms
governing loss of proviral competence.
 Aim 1: Assess correlates of proviral silencing in NF-kB-depleted macrophages. We will determine
the stage in the viral replication cycle at which proviruses are rendered inactive and, through heterokaryon
formation, whether dominant negative factors mediate irreversible proviral silencing by NF-kB inhibition. We will
examine whether inactive proviruses exhibit evidence of epigenetic modification and methylation and whether
inhibiting methylation can maintain proviral responsiveness to reactivation in the face of NF-kB inhibition.
 Aim 2: Examine whether the proviral silencing created under conditions of NF-kB inhibition can
be extended to infected CD4+ T cells from ART-suppressed subjects and to other primary macrophage
populations. We will assess whether NF-kB inhibition can irreversibly impede HIV-1 reactivation in CD4+ T cells
from individuals on effective ART and whether this proviral silencing can also be achieved in macrophages that
are physiologically representative of the major myeloid cell compartments including lung (alveolar macrophages),
liver (Kupffer cells), and Central Nervous System (microglia).
 If the proposed studies are successful, they will provide the rationale for in vivo studies using established
SHIV/macaque models of macrophage reservoirs and NF-kB antagonists currently in clinical use."
10912644,"SUMMARY
Rotator cuff tendon tears account for more than 4.5 million physician visits and over 300,000 surgical repairs
annually in the US. The healing rates of the tendon-bone interface, i.e., enthesis, remain low, despite continual
improvements in fixation techniques. Moreover, pre-existing degeneration at the rotator cuff enthesis puts an
estimated 17 million Americans at increased risk for rotator cuff impairment and tearing. A growing body of
evidence indicates that cigarette smoking is an important risk factor. CDC data show that almost 13% of US
adults smoke cigarettes, yet South Carolina rates are even higher at nearly 18%, with high school youth smoking
cigarettes in SC at more than 3 times the US rate. Despite this significant impact, we still lack a fundamental
understanding of the effects of cigarette smoking on the mechanical properties of the enthesis and the
biomechanic mechanisms. Obstacles in formulating such understanding are partly attributed to (i) challenges in
creating a realistic smoke exposure environment using well-controlled animal studies and (ii) the difficulties in
characterizing the small-scale structural changes and correlating the structural changes with the deterioration of
mechanical properties. We propose to utilize our custom-built automatic smoking chamber that resembles
realistic cigarette smoking on a rat model, plus adopt an integrated experimental and computational approach to
systematically understand the structure-function relationship of rat supraspinatus tendon-humerus enthesis and
how it is impacted by cigarette smoking. The proposed studies will test the hypothesis that smoking directly
affects the structure of collagen fibers plus the mineral gradient and distributions at the enthesis, all of which we
further hypothesize will lead to deterioration of the enthesis by changing the microscopic deformation patterns.
The specific aims are (1) to characterize the impact of smoking on the mechanical properties of the rotator cuff
tendon-bone enthesis; (2) to delineate the changes from smoking on the multiphasic structures at the tendon-
bone enthesis; (3) to construct a multiscale modeling framework that bridges the structures with the mechanical
properties. We will integrate tissue biomechanics, bioimaging, and multiscale modeling to characterize the
structure-function relationship of the enthesis, provide novel mechanistic data that will inform rotator cuff injury
risk associated with cigarette smoking, and understand the underlying mechanisms. Once this approach is
successfully applied, the tools and insights from this project can be transferred to other soft tissue-bone
interfaces. Moreover, the new knowledge generated from this project, particularly the degenerative impact of
smoking on rotator cuff tendon-bone enthesis, will lay the foundation for innovating treatment strategies for
repairing the interfaces and improving the surgical outcomes of high-risk and/or rural area patients."
10863951,"PROJECT SUMMARY
CD4+ T helper (Th) cells of different Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg subtypes, developed in thymus, have important
functions in adaptive immunity. Their dysregulation has also been implicated in diseases such as Th2-
associated inflammatory and allergic diseases including asthma, Crohn’s disease and atopic dermatitis. Th2
lineage-specific differentiation from naïve CD4+ T cells is tightly controlled by cytokines (IL-4, 5, 13) through
highly ordered subtype-specific gene transcription directed by a set of transcription factors and regulators with
opposing activities to promote (YY1, Gata3, Stat6) or inhibit (Foxp3) Th2 cell differentiation. However, the
underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. BRD4, a key member of the bromodomain and extra-
terminal (BET) protein family, is well known for its role in gene transcriptional activation, but whether and how it
functions in gene transcriptional repression in a cell-type specific manner has remained elusive. Recently, we
discovered that Brd4 works with Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to repress transcriptional expression
of Th2-negative regulators Foxp3 and E3-ubiqutin ligase Fbxw7 in lineage-specific differentiation of Th2 cells
from mouse primary naïve CD4+ T cells. Brd4 through its second bromodomain (BD2) binds to lysine-
acetylated-EED subunit of the PRC2 complex to control target gene repression through histone H3 lysine 27
trimethylation (H3K27me3). We found that Foxp3 represses transcription of Th2-specific transcription factor
Gata3, while Fbxw7 controls Gata3 protein stability via ubiquitination-mediated protein degradation, which in
turn ensures Gata3-mediated transcriptional activation of Th2 cytokines including Il4, Il5 and Il13. Chemical
inhibition of BRD4 BD2 induces transcriptional de-repression of Foxp3 and Fbxw7, and transcriptional down-
regulation of Il4, Il5 and Il13, resulting in inhibition of Th2 cell differentiation. Our study uncovers previously
unappreciated BRD4 functions in directing Th2-specific gene transcriptional repression to safeguard Th2 cell
lineage differentiation. Building on our promising findings, in this study, we seek to define the mechanistic
details of BRD4’s transcriptional repression function in the temporal regulation of Th2 cells, develop and use

The focus of this project is on the mechanisms of signal transduction by the large macromolecular
supercomplex called GATOR, which is made of three individual sub-complexes with distinct roles: GATOR1,
GATOR2, and KICSTOR. The GATOR supercomplex was previously shown to be responsible for receiving
information from various cellular sensors, and then passing that information down to a large protein kinase
called mTORC1, the role of which is to regulate cellular metabolism in response to the environment. One of the
key signals that must be relayed to mTORC1 is availability of nutrients in the cell — amino acids and sugars.
Monitoring how much of every individual nutrient the cell has at its disposal is critical for making rational
decisions that will determine the future activities of the cell — whether it should grow when nutrients are
available, or stand-by and maintain itself when nutrients are in short supply.
This project will specifically focus on amino acids as signaling molecules. Our goal is to decipher the molecular
chain of events that accompany changes in cellular concentration of three critical amino acids — leucine,
arginine, and methionine. Indeed, out of twenty different amino acid types, only three of them are directly
monitored by the mTORC1 pathway to inform cellular growth decisions. Each one of these amino acids also
appears to signal to the GATOR complex — via three distinct mechanisms. Yet, despite extensive research in
this field, we still know very little about how these mechanisms propagate amino-acid availability signals to
either activate or deactivate mTORC1. Is the presence of leucine, arginine, and methionine equally important,
or perhaps one amino acid dominates the rest? Are there any large conformational changes that accompany
binding of amino-acid sensors to GATOR proteins? Does the composition and localization of the GATOR
supercomplex change upon amino acid supplementation or withdrawal?
We built this research project around three main themes that will begin answering these (and many more!)
fascinating questions. In Theme #1, we will focus on the GATOR complex itself — in its apo form. Theme #2
will explore the mechanism of leucine and arginine signal transduction to GATOR2. And in Theme #3, we will
attempt to decipher the enigmatic methionine-availability effects on GATOR1. Our ambition is to inspire deeper
protein-mechanism-centered thinking in this field. And by providing novel protocols, protein complex structures,
and a set of validated structure-guided mutants, we will lay the foundation that will enable new research
directions, while also contributing to the development of therapeutics against devastating diseases of growth,
such as cancer."
10851872,"Microorganisms live in communities in nature. The structure of microbial communities is shaped
by the interactions with neighboring organisms. These interactions are often mediated by small
molecules called natural products. Biosynthesis of these natural products is tightly regulated and
can be induced by several factors including microbial interactions, quorum sensing, and the
presence of chemical inducers such as antimicrobial compounds, or specific metabolic precursors
required for biosynthesis. Description of circumstances that activate natural product biosynthesis
are crucial to unravel mechanisms of induction at the molecular level and to determine their
ecological functions. The overall objectives of our research program is to understand how natural
product biosynthesis is activated by specific microbial and chemical environments as well as to
mimic these environments in vitro enabling discovery of new natural products and their
biosynthetic pathways. We will utilize mucus-dwelling bacteria from human airways, and marine
corals, both of which are sources of unique natural products to investigate natural product-
mediated interspecies interactions.
In the project period, we will develop and apply mass spectrometry-based workflows to 1)
elucidate the role of natural products and quorum sensing in interspecies interactions in host-
relevant chemical and physical environment via the use of synthetic human mucus, 2) understand
how chemical inducers such as antibiotics shape microbial community structure of mucus
microbiomes, and 3) characterize natural product chemical space of mucus-dwelling bacteria
derived from corals, an understudied resource of bioactive natural products. The methods
described in this proposal enhance detection and characterization of natural product chemical
space. Thus, this work will identify new natural products with antibiotic potential, which are needed
in the face of increasing antibiotic resistance and declining rate of discovery of natural products-
based antibiotics. The observations from this study will illuminate the mechanistic basis for natural
product-mediated microbial interactions and natural-product mediated structuring of microbial
communities."

 Our main goal is to understand how internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) and 3' cap-independent translation
enhancers (3'CITEs) promote cap-independent translation of genomes in (+)-strand RNA viruses. Despite highly
diverse sequences and predicted secondary structures, IRESs and 3ʹCITEs from evolutionarily distant viruses
recruit the same components from the host to initiate genome translation. Structural information for viral IRESs
that bind directly to the ribosome is limited and understanding of 3-dimensional (3D) structures and interactions
of IRESs and 3'CITEs that promote translation by other mechanisms is largely unknown. We will use X-ray
crystallography to determine the high-resolution crystal structures of these RNAs, focusing on the type I and type
II picornaviral IRESs and tombusvirus 3'CITEs due to their unique mechanisms of recruiting translation initiation
factors and the ribosomal subunits through a multistep, dynamic assembly process using modular RNA domains.
Our strategy employs Fab fragments as chaperones to crystallize and determine structures of RNAs and RNPs,
an extension of a technology that PI helped develop as a postdoc. Since moving to UMBC, we have obtained
crystals of coxsackievirus IRES domain V (an example of type I IRES) in a complex with Fab BL3-6 that diffracted
to 3.36 Å resolution (the first 3D structural information for type I IRESs). A partial structure of the dV contains a
3-way junction analogous to that observed in cardiovirus J-K and hepatitis A virus dV structures (PI's previous
work). Optimization of crystallization conditions to obtain high-resolution diffraction data, analysis of SAXS data
to access in-solution structural information, and purification of the human eIF4G HEAT-1 domain for binding
studies are underway. Recently, we solved the 2.9 Å resolution crystal structure of a T-shaped domain of saguaro
cactus virus 3ꞌCITE in a complex with Fab BL3-6 and characterized its binding with human eIF4E. Many viruses
within the tombusviridae family contain 3ꞌCITEs with similar domains, suggesting that these RNAs adopt a shared
topology to mimic mRNA 5ꞌ-cap for binding eIF4E. We are thus poised to determine the crystal structures of
different kinds of viral IRESs, 3'CITEs, and some cellular IRESs. The Fab approach has successfully solved the
crystal structures of several RNAs, but it has not been demonstrated for RNP complexes; the second goal is to
integrate this Fab-assisted technology to crystallize and determine the structures of RNP complexes. The third
goal is to create anti-RNA single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) as unique probes for RNA visualization to
facilitate the localization, tracking, and quantification of viral RNAs in host cells. We have obtained promising
preliminary data in this direction, including the development of three anti-RNA scFvs and their scFv-GFP fusions
based on the existing anti-RNA Fabs. The scFvs with and without GFP tags bind the cognate RNA targets with
affinities similar to their parent Fabs. When taken together, the proposed studies will provide deeper insights into
the mechanisms of cap-independent translation initiation in (+)-sense RNA viruses and unlock opportunities for
developing RNA-targeted therapeutics against these pathogens that cause human, animal, and plant diseases."

Cells sharing a common genome transcribe a subset of their available genes to perform different functions.
Polycomb-group (PcG) proteins contribute to cell specialization by binding and chemically modifying chromatin
around lowly-transcribed genes to further reduce (“silence”) their expression. Although many PcG proteins have
been identified, mystery surrounds the most interesting aspects of their function. The utility of silencing derives
from its selective imposition. However, unknown mechanisms determine when silencing begins or ends during
normal development. Furthermore, how PcG proteins epigenetically associate with different target genes in
different cells is poorly understood. It is important to resolve these questions because silencing mistakes disrupt
development and contribute to human cancers. The proposed research program uses a new model system,
Drosophila nurse cell differentiation, and new genetic and genomic engineering tools to study how silencing
initiation, maintenance, and reversal are developmentally regulated. The proposed model system overcomes
technical limitations of studying silencing initiation in early embryos and embryonic cell cultures. A new proposed
tool, termed UAS-gene swap, allows genetic substitution of PcG proteins with mutant versions in thousands of
cells, and is compatible with sensitive molecular approaches like ChIPseq. The first proposed research direction
will use UAS-gene swap to identify the interactions between PcG proteins and transcription factors that are
important for establishing or preventing silencing at each potential Polycomb target gene. A second research
direction will explore how a single PcG protein, Scm, is post-translationally regulated to time silencing initiation
in differentiating nurse cells and other developmental contexts. Finally, a third research direction will use a highly-
efficient genome engineering approach to explore how some Polycomb target genes are stably silenced while
others are not. These diverse directions will significantly advance our understanding of how development
regulates Polycomb silencing. They will also generate new tools to study gene expression control in developing
organisms that will be valuable to the broader research community. Lastly, this research program may reveal
potentially conserved mechanisms that regulate early embryonic development and prevent human cancers."
10892654,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The ecological concept of diversity is deceptively simple: what organisms are present and how are they
distributed. The advent of high-throughput sequencing enabled more than a decade of observational human
microbiome studies; however, these studies frequently established correlation, but not causation, between
microbial diversity and health. Through mechanistic research, I and others have shown the significance of strain
variation, i.e. phenotypic and genotypic variation within a species, in host-microbiome interactions; however,
most of our understanding comes from a limited range of model organisms which poorly represent the large
diversity observed in the human gastrointestinal tract. Rather than view strain diversity as a limitation and caveat
in microbiome research, my group takes a fundamentally different approach: we exploit it as a tool for
mechanistic research. The mission of my research program is to understand how our microbial communities
shape human health and physiology. We do this through leveraging computational biology and big data with wet
lab experiments including gnotobiotic animal models to balance reductionism and biological relevance. The
research themes in this proposal ask discrete questions about the interface of host and microbe but are unified
in their approach of using naturally occurring strain variation coupled to comparative genomics as a tool for gene
discovery in a reference panel of >300 genome sequenced bacterial isolates. Theme I will ask a fundamental
question: can we leverage 10 years of publicly available data to rationally design functional synthetic
communities? These consortia will act as both tools for understanding the assembly and function of complex
communities, and will have translational applications as alternatives to human fecal transplant therapy. Theme
II will focus on deconvoluting the shared host and microbial metabolism of bile acids (BAs), a family of
compounds with broad relevance to infectious and autoimmune diseases, cancer, and metabolic health. Despite
their importance, the microbial metabolic pathways of BA metabolism and their phylogenetic distribution are
poorly characterized. Through comprehensive analysis of our strain library and synthetic communities derived
thereof, we will determine the origins of biologically significant BAs. Understanding these trans-species pathways
will address an important question: can we predict the metabolic output of a community based on the sum of its
parts? Theme III addresses an urgent question in medicine: how does microbial strain-variation contribute to
interpersonal variation in drug response? We are now working on a new class of important orally administered
drugs which were not previously known to interact with the gut microbiome: antimalarials. Building on preliminary
data demonstrating off-target strain-variable antibacterial effects, we will characterize how bacterial interactions
with antimalarials affect therapeutic efficiency. These themes have a shared and unified goal: to generate both
resources and fundamental understanding of host-microbe interactions leading to translational applications."

 Physicians, who were previously told that it is medical malpractice to undertreat pain, are now told that they
must avoid prescribing opioids whenever possible because of the risk of addiction. However, while analgesics
such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are effective in relieving mild pain, they do not provide nearly the
relief of severe pain that opioids do. Our recent work suggests that it may be possible to secure potent relief for
severe pain with opioids, with a greatly reduced risk of addiction.
 In 2018 we reported that the brains of human heroin addicts had an average 54% increase in the number
of “detectable” hypocretin (Hcrt=orexin) neurons and a 22% shrinkage of these neurons[1]. We found
that these changes can outlast drug intake for at least 3 years. We further reported that similar changes in Hcrt
neuron number and size could be induced by longterm daily administration of addictive doses of morphine to
mice. We showed that these changes were not a result of neurogenesis, rather resulting from increased Hcrt
synthesis in “Hcrt neurons” not producing detectable amounts of the Hcrt peptides at baseline. Subsequently,
Aston-Jones's group reported a similar increase in the number of detectable Hcrt neurons in cocaine and
fentanyl addicted rats, indicating that this is a correlate of several types of addiction. We had reported in 2000
that the loss of, on average, 90% of Hcrt neurons was the cause of human narcolepsy [2,3]. Narcoleptic
humans have an extremely low rate of drug abuse, despite their prescribed daily use of addictive drugs,
consistent with an important role for Hcrt in addiction. We find that morphine treated “narcoleptic” mice, in
which Hcrt neurons had been selectively ablated, have greatly reduced naloxone triggered aversion, i.e. are
“less addicted.” Recently we reported that chronic opioid administration greatly increases the projections of
Hcrt neurons to locus coeruleus [4] and to the ventral tegmental area (Fig 5), regions linked to addiction.
 We now find that the addiction-associated changes in behavior and in Hcrt neuron number and size
produced by morphine in mice are completely prevented by the dual Hcrt receptor antagonist suvorexant.
Our pilot data indicates that the analgesic effect of morphine is not diminished by suvorexant. We will
compare the effectiveness of suvorexant with Hcrt-R1 and Hcrt-R2 antagonists in reducing opiate induced
changes in Hcrt neurons, and in reducing opiate anticipation and naloxone induced aversion. We will
determine if Hcrt-R1 or Hcrt-R2 blockers affect morphine analgesia. We will determine the effect of Hcrt
antagonists on the activity of Hcrt neurons after morphine and on opioid induced increases in Hcrt axonal
projections, using quantitative confocal microscopy, electrical recording of unit activity and in vivo calcium
imaging of Hcrt neurons. Our pilot data suggest that it may soon be possible to relieve severe pain with opioids
without causing opioid addiction, thereby reducing the US opioid death toll, which now exceeds 76,000/year."

 Circadian clocks are a defining feature of living organisms. Rhythms originate from the molecular clocks
of cells and propagate anatomically across the brain and body. A molecular understanding of the cooperation
among 30 trillion individual clocks in the human body is a daunting yet important scientific challenge. Currently,
much less is known of non-brain cell clocks, termed ‘peripheral clocks’ or ‘peripheral oscillators’. My research
program aims to identify coordination mechanisms that enable higher-order (e.g., from cells to tissue) circadian
rhythms and their physiological implications. To study clock function at the multi-oscillator level, we use molecular
approaches and genetically defined cell and mouse models. We aim to achieve two goals specifically for this
ESI MIRA R35 proposal. First, we will investigate how noisy, damped, and incomplete clock mechanisms within
single cells combine to produce unified, precise, and robust rhythms at the organ-level. We will tease apart this
coordination mechanism by applying single-cell methodologies and bioinformatic tools to quantify the behavior
of individual hepatocyte oscillators under different liver rhythmicity states in vivo. Second, we will interrogate how
rhythms are coupled across two peripheral organs. It is unclear how multiple tissue clocks synergize towards
systemic-level control of daily homeostatic functions. Using a novel genetic mouse model that I have already
constructed and validated, we will test the reciprocal influence between liver and skeletal muscle clocks and
delineate the contribution of this axis to the biochemical makeup of the systemic circulation over circadian time.
We will also determine how this axis is augmented by feeding-fasting behavior, a major brain-driven circadian
cue. For both goals, we will focus on the identification of key molecular mediators and downstream homeostatic
functions. The MIRA will afford us the ability to chase down the most impactful leads from these two areas and
will allow me to dedicate more time to mentoring activities, an aspect of academic life that I am passionate about.
My research program, based in circadian biology, provides a technically and conceptually rich training
environment for graduate students and postdoctoral associates. As a whole, the proposed work will generate
foundational knowledge of the complex inter-cellular interactions that generate rhythms. This knowledge is
crucial for elucidating the molecular basis of rhythm disruption, an ever-growing occurrence in modern society.
Circadian disruption is broadly linked with disease and thus understanding fundamental clock mechanisms offers
insight into root causes of many human ailments. Likewise, the proposed studies will yield novel molecular
targets aimed at counteracting rhythm disruption."

 Considering 20-25% of pharmaceuticals on the market today contain one or more fluorine atoms in their
active ingredient (several of which appear on the WHO’s List of Essential Medicines), it is evident that fluorine
chemistry continues to have a profound impact on drug development. Yet, despite the indisputable significance
of fluorine atoms and fluorinated groups in modern medicinal chemistry, there has been a historical lag in their
implementation in pharmaceuticals over the last century. The reason for this lag can most often be attributed to
synthetic accessibility, as methods to install fluorine on molecules have been notoriously reliant on hazardous
reagents, e.g., F2 and HF. While methods to incorporate, for instance, CF3, OCF3, and SCF3 groups on complex
molecules have become far safer and more accessible in the last few decades (and these groups have since
become commonplace in drug design), there remain a number of fluorinated groups with untapped potential that
cannot be easily synthesized yet. This proposal specifically identifies the SF5, N(CF3)2, and N(CF3)(CF2H) groups
as desirable motifs that have demonstrated promise yet continue to be underemployed due to the fact that there
are virtually no user-friendly methods to make them.
 Accordingly, the proposed work is centered on addressing the synthetic chemistry bottlenecks that are
preventing the realization of applications of these fluorinated groups. For one, the SF5 group has been studied
as a bioisosteric replacement for a CF3 or t-Bu group, but only aryl-SF5 compounds have been made available
commercially. Given the recent increase in accessibility of SF5Cl, we can now envision ways to expand the
realm of possibility in C(sp3)–SF5 bond formation. Specifically, SF5 radical chemistry can be merged with strain-
release functionalization to form novel “hybrid bioisosteres” that add another dimension of flexibility in molecular
design. Methods are also envisioned to synthesize and examine some of the first benzylic-SF5 compounds, as
well as other potential building blocks for the medicinal chemistry toolkit. The N(CF3)2 group (notably distinct
from N–CF3) is arguably even less accessible/explored than the SF5 group, but it has demonstrated promise as
a lipophilic NO2 group alternative. While all known methods make this group to date strictly require F2 or aHF,
our approaches seek reasonable ways to circumvent these reagents altogether. This will make the N(CF3)2
group available to a significantly broader community of scientists. Lastly, the N(CF3)(CF2H) group is evidently
the least accessible of them all, but it is liable to be an interesting alternative to the N(CF3)2 group with its added
ability to serve as a lipophilic hydrogen-bond donor. We have envisioned ways to make this that avoid the current
reliance on toxic SF4 gas. In all, safer methods to make the SF5, N(CF3)2, and N(CF3)(CF2H) groups will enable
the study of their physical properties and how to leverage them in the design of potential drug candidates."

Asthma affects nearly 6 million children in the United States, and on average, each child with asthma experiences
at least one exacerbation per year. Pediatric asthma accounts for over 790,000 emergency department visits,
64,000 hospitalizations, and nearly $6 billion in direct healthcare costs annually. Asthma disproportionately
affects minority children, who are at risk for more severe outcomes. Asthma is a heterogeneous disease with a
range of etiologies, triggers, severities, and treatment responses (i.e., subtypes). Despite that well-known
heterogeneity, asthma subtypes are largely confined to a simple dichotomous classification of allergic versus
non-allergic, which does not account for overlapping subtypes, subtype evolution, severity, nor do they include
social determinants of health (SDOH). As such, if we are to reduce the burden of asthma at both the individual
and population level, we must improve asthma subtype characterization to help clinicians craft more personalized
primary and emergency care. To date, however, asthma subtyping studies have been limited by small sample
sizes, ignored temporal information, and/or focused on individual or a handful of sites. The proliferation of large
clinical research networks (CRNs) with real-world data (RWD) from electronic health records (EHRs), combined
with advancements in machine learning offer unique opportunities to improve subtyping of pediatric asthma
patients. Our study team’s preliminary analysis of asthma exacerbations in the OneFlorida+ CRN using only
structured data found five pediatric asthma subtypes which varied by race/ethnicity, severity, digital biomarkers,
and comorbidities. Our work supports that there is further heterogeneity in pediatric asthma beyond the
classically defined subtypes of allergic vs non-allergic. In this project, we will leverage the OneFlorida+ CRN’s
large repository of RWD (covering nearly 20 million patients in the southeast) and a novel privacy-preserving
federated machine learning-based framework to: (1) identify pediatric asthma patients, their severity, subtypes,
and disease progression (i.e., progression subtypes), and (2) fine-tune those global models to local OneFlorida+
sites with site-specific data to account for between-site heterogeneity. In addition to structured EHR data, we will
include spatiotemporally linked environmental data and use natural language processing to include clinical note
data such as symptoms and SDOH. To guide our work and inform implementation efforts, we will establish a
stakeholder advisory committee with pediatric asthma, healthcare system, and public health stakeholders, and
conduct focus groups with local OneFlorida+ site clinicians to develop and test EHR prototypes that integrate
subtype data. Pediatric asthma progression subtypes built using RWD from diverse populations combined with
stakeholder engagement will move the field closer to precision primary and emergency care that improves
outcomes. Our novel privacy-preserving federated machine learning methods address several challenges of
RWD analysis and will be a generalizable framework for other CRNs to adopt, facilitating widespread
dissemination of this work, and paving a path forward for progression subtype analyses of other chronic diseases."

Our current understanding of in vitro protein folding is due to decades of experimental and computational
research that provided high-resolution characterization of protein structure, identification of folding principles,
and development of folding algorithms. However, proteins often participate in new and unexpected functional
and pathological behaviors in vivo. Because protein processes involve a large network of interactions that
strongly depend on the environment, understanding how proteins work inside cells requires knowledge of protein
structure, stability, and dynamics in vivo. While evidence that the cellular environment perturbs protein behaviors
emerged over half a century ago, we still have limited fundamental information about the effects of these
cooperative cellular interactions on protein properties. The gap in knowledge is largely attributable to the weak
transient nature of interactions in the cellular milieu and challenges associated with studying protein functions in
living cells. This limitation is concerning because proteins in cells and organisms are continuously interacting
with other biomolecules, which may disrupt the ability of a protein to fold and assemble properly and results in
loss of function and eventually disease. To address these gaps, our research group leverages groundbreaking
in vivo spectro-microscopy methods, in combination with functional biochemical assays, in vitro biophysical
spectroscopy, and numerical analysis solutions to characterize protein structural dynamics in living cells and
tissues. This platform will transform our ability to examine unexplored layers of protein complexity and regulation
in cells and tissues, specifically: (1) Do classic in vitro protein principles translate to cells? How accurate are the
in-cell predictions of folding theory and molecular dynamics simulations? (2) Can we develop methods to
visualize the spatial distribution of metabolism and associated metabolic protein structural dynamics in living
cells? (3) How does thermal adaptation and acclimation by organisms change the stability, folding, and
aggregation of proteins in differentiated tissues? Overall, this work will lead to a greater understanding of how
remodeling of the cell interior during development, environmental stress, and disease contributes to protein
homeostasis. Unraveling these interactions will improve our molecular-level understanding of essential
processes in human health and disease."
10910020,"PROJECT SUMMARY
All stem cells have the capacity for self-renewal, an ability to create daughter stem cells without differentiating
into other cell types. Stem cells receive the signals from their niches that instruct them to self-renew and prevent
them from differentiating through a cascade of inter-organelle communication processes. Substantial evidence
has recently revealed that glioblastoma, the most common and lethal type of brain tumor, has “roots” in a
population of glioma stem cells (GSCs) that possess an inexhaustible ability to self-renew. Unlike neural stem
cells (NSCs), GSCs are also able to sustain their stemness in the suboptimal environments they encounter
outside their niches during invasion. How GSCs, but not NSCs, are able to maintain their stemness outside the
niches remains unclear. To identify potential glioma suppressors that affect interaction of GSCs and niches, we
discovered that RNA-binding protein Quaking (QKI) is a key regulator of endocytosis that controls receptor
trafficking, degradation, and signaling desensitization. Mechanistically, QKI regulates pre-mRNA stability of
genes that regulate lipid components of endolysosomes, particularly the unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs). As a
consequence of defective endolysosomal function, we showed that depletion of QKI and inhibition of UFA
biosynthesis led to the enrichment of cytoplasmic membrane-bound receptors that are required for maintaining
stemness. In addition, since polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are the substrates of ferroptosis,
downregulation of PUFA due to Qki loss renders GSCs resistant to ferroptosis, a major tumor suppression
mechanism. Supporting the importance of intracellular vesicle trafficking system regulated by QKI and UFA
biosynthesis in glioblastoma, we found that lower levels of QKI, endolysosome and Stearoyl-CoA desaturase
(SCD, the key enzyme for UFA biosynthesis) all correlate significantly with poorer prognosis in glioblastoma
patients. Our long-term goal is to develop therapies that target the defective endolysosome function in
glioblastoma. Given that QKI is a major regulator of SCD genes and inhibition of both QKI and UFA biosynthesis
can impair the endolysosome activity and promote gliomagenesis, we hypothesize that QKI deletions/mutations
disrupt endolysosomal function in NSCs and GSCs through downregulation of UFA biosynthesis and restoration
of PUFA levels can sensitize tumor cells to ferroptosis. To test this hypothesis, we will (a) determine the role of
Scd1/2-mediated UFA biosynthesis in QKI-regulated endolysosome functions in both NSCs and GSCs, (b) clarify
the mechanism by which QKI regulates Scd1/2 pre-mRNA stability in both NSCs and GSCs, and (c) evaluate
the effects of restoration of PUFA levels in sensitizing tumor cells to ferroptosis. Together, these studies will
elucidate the molecular mechanisms of how the glioma suppressor QKI regulates intracellular vesicle trafficking
in NSCs and GSCs through lipid metabolism, and more importantly, they will contribute to the development of
therapeutic strategies that specifically target QKI/SCD-depleted glioblastoma."

Sexual reproduction evolved more than one billion years ago, shortly after the appearance of eukaryotes. Sex
is theorized to be an important aspect of creating genetic variation, adapting to new environments, and in
removing disadvantageous traits from the gene pool. Despite this, many eukaryotes have reverted to asexual
reproductive strategies. Importantly, such transitions to asexual reproduction have huge evolutionary impacts:
we see regular examples of this in the rapid spread of invasive, pathogenic, and drug-resistant organisms.
Unfortunately, such transitions are notoriously difficult to mechanistically interrogate due to their lack of
experimental tractability and the fact that many reversions to asexuality are quite ancient. However, arthropods
are rich in recently acquired vertically inherited microbes (e.g., Wolbachia, Rickettsia, and Cardinium) that
convert their arthropod hosts to asexual reproduction. So-called “parthenogenesis induction” has been
reinvented multiple times across these bacteria and relies on microbial mechanisms for impacting host meiosis
or mitosis to alter ploidy. We can manipulate these recently asexual lineages in the lab to mechanistically
define the cell biology of asexual reproduction. Furthermore, because there are numerous independent
transitions to microbe-mediated asexuality, and lineages will slowly undergo a loss of sexual function, we can
use this system to track the genomic and mechanistic consequences of lost sex. The long-term goal of my lab
is to link mechanistic processes of mitosis, meiosis, and reproduction to long-term organismal and genomic
consequences. This proposal describes my lab’s research goals across the next five years, which
include: (1) mechanistically characterizing bacterial proteins mediating asexual reproduction, (2)
identifying mitotic- and meiotic- effector proteins across diverse bacteria and reproductive biologies,
and (3) using forward genetics to map the genomic consequences of lost sex. Specifically, our creative
interdisciplinary research plan integrates genomic approaches (e.g., genome sequencing, comparative
genomics, quantitative trait loci mapping), molecular approaches in non-model organisms, and genetics in
tractable model systems (e.g., yeast, Drosophila). We will build on our recent discovery of the first putative
asexuality inducing bacterial effector proteins to broadly define how microbes have evolved to manipulate
mitosis and meiosis, and disentangle the causes of reproductive switches from the consequences. In addition
to the broad significance of reproduction, these systems afford new opportunities to understand fundamental
aspects of cell biology that underly many human-health relevant processes. For example, defects in mitosis
are typical of certain degenerative conditions and cancers, and changes in ploidy significantly contribute to
fungal pathogenesis and drug resistance. Our focus on novel mechanisms for altering reproduction and cell
division will support the development of new therapeutic avenues across a range of systems."

Phosphoinositides (PIs) are a minor class of phospholipids often comprising less than 1% of the cellular lipid
cohort. Despite the low abundance, PIs have huge impacts on cell physiology and alterations of PI signaling
pathways are associated with the pathogenesis of many human diseases including neurodegenerative diseases,
metabolic disorders, autoimmunity, and cancer. This pathophysiological importance is largely due to the
signaling roles of PIs which depend on the subcellular distribution of PIs and on key interactions between PIs
and PI effectors. A twist in PI signaling is that in contrast to general belief, a substantial fraction of PIs is found
in non-membranous nuclear compartments. The nature and functions of nuclear PIs remains largely unknown
due to the lack of systematic studies of nuclear PIs and PI effectors. We have expertise in defining and
characterizing novel PI effector proteins involved in key signaling pathways including vesicular trafficking,
cytoskeleton dynamics, and transcription regulation. Since PI kinases are often associated with PI effectors thus
ensuring PI generation is spatiotemporally linked to PI effector activation, we have performed proteomic analyses
to identify the interactomes of the nuclear PI-generating kinases. Out of these proteomic screens, we have
validated several nuclear complexes that associate with nuclear PI kinases or with PIs themselves. The validated
complexes include transcription factors and coactivators, epigenetic enzymes and associated corepressors, the
DNA repair machinery, and factors involved in RNA processing. We recently discovered that nuclear PIs
accumulate at distinct subnuclear regions such as nuclear speckles and DNA double-strand breaks. Based on
our novel discoveries of PIs and PI kinases interacting with effectors in the nucleus, the overarching goal of
my research program is to decipher the signaling pathways emanating from the nuclear PIs. Our overall
hypothesis is that upon suitable stimuli the activation of nuclear PI kinase at specific subnuclear compartments
elevates the local concentration of nuclear PIs and these nuclear PI foci function as platforms to regulate PI
effectors recruited to the foci mediating transcription regulation and assembly of complexes that regulate
epigenetic changes. The goals of my research programs for the next five years include dissecting the nature and
subnuclear distribution of nuclear PIs using novel microscopic tools which will enable us to obtain high resolution
images of the nuclear PIs, defining the new roles of PIs regulating chromatin positioning to nuclear speckles,
and investigating novel roles of nuclear PIs in regulating gene expression with focuses on transcription regulation
and epigenetic repression with innovative cell biological, genome-wide, and biochemical approaches. Upon the
completion of the research programs, we will obtain insight into the unexpected roles and molecular mechanism
of PIs in the nucleus, with the goal of identifying novel strategies for targeting the nuclear PI signaling pathways
dysregulated in diverse human disease."

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a disabling chronic inflammatory condition that includes two subtypes,
ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD). IBD causes gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal
pain, rectal bleeding, and diarrhea, and extraintestinal symptoms such as sleep and mood disturbances. IBD
affects over 3 million Americans and has a relapsing and remitting course with up to 50% of patients
experiencing exacerbations each year. Immune targeted therapies such as biologics help control IBD, but
patients continue to suffer from high rates of suboptimal disease control and extraintestinal symptoms such as
fatigue, depression, and impaired quality of life. An urgent need exists to develop adjunctive treatment
approaches to better manage IBD symptoms and disease activity, which have minimal side effects, and are
readily available and affordable. Circadian disruption (disruption of the “body clock”), is proinflammatory,
worsens intestinal function, and is associated with increased disease activity, worse gastrointestinal and
extraintestinal symptoms and impaired quality of life in IBD. Thus, circadian disruption may be an important
modifiable treatment target for IBD. Morning light treatment, which advances (shifts earlier) and stabilizes
circadian timing, may have potential to improve symptoms and disease severity in IBD. However, no studies
have explored the potential therapeutic benefits of morning light treatment for IBD. Recently, we tested a 4-
week, 1-hour daily morning light treatment in individuals with fibromyalgia (R21NR016930), using a
commercially available wearable light device. We found the morning light treatment was feasible, reliably
advanced and stabilized sleep timing, and significantly improved depression, sleep quality and quality of life (all
p≤0.02), all with minimal side effects. Encouraged by this success, we propose to test the same morning light
treatment in individuals with IBD, in response to PAS-20-160: Small R01s for Clinical Trials, which does not
require preliminary data. Sixty-eight individuals with biopsy-proven IBD, clinically active disease and impaired
IBD quality of life will be randomized to 4 weeks of morning light treatment (1 h/day) or 4 weeks of treatment as
usual (TAU), with equivalent study contact in each group (completed sample n=50). Patient-reported outcomes
(IBD quality of life, mood, sleep), clinician-rated disease severity, and a biomarker of gastrointestinal
inflammation (fecal calprotectin) will be assessed before and after treatment. Aim 1 will determine the effect of
morning light treatment versus TAU on patient-reported outcomes and Aim 2 will determine the effects on
clinician-rated disease severity. We will also explore the effect of morning light treatment versus TAU on a
biomarker of gastrointestinal inflammation (fecal calprotectin), and the potential moderating effects of steroid
use, restless leg syndrome and biological sex. This project will be the first to test morning light treatment in
people with IBD, and results will provide a foundation for developing morning light treatment as a novel non-
pharmacological adjunctive treatment with potential to enhance existing treatment outcomes for IBD."
10878966,"Suicide is a leading cause of death, and individuals who attempt suicide and receive hospital treatment are at
high risk for suicide within a year. The identification and validation of warning signs (WS) for suicidal behavior –
near-term risk factors– is a national priority. Determining if an individual is at risk now drives high-impact
decisions in acute care settings within emergency departments (e.g., whether to admit a patient) and crisis
lines (e.g., whether to send a mobile crisis team). Yet, there has been little research on ‘when’ individuals are
at near-term risk or WS (i.e., within minutes, hours, a day) for suicide attempts. This clinically- and
theoretically-driven study addresses critical gaps in our understanding of WS for suicide attempts. We seek to
a) discover novel warning signs candidates for suicide attempts, b) validate, and generate the first risk
estimates, for these candidates and WS put forward in recent theoretical formulations, c) compare risk-
estimates of WS to determine if those currently prioritized in risk assessments in acute care settings is
warranted, and d) develop new algorithms to detect linguistic signals of specific WS content in patients'
narrative interviews. We propose a multi-site mixed-methods study that will recruit 400 adults currently
hospitalized for a suicide attempt in two academic medical centers in the Upper Midwest. Subjects will be
asked to tell the narrative story of their attempt in their own words, and also undergo a detailed semi-structured
interview to obtain systematic data about hypothesized WS on the day of the attempt and the day prior. We will
discover potential novel WS candidates using subjects’ narrative stories coded by experts using qualitative
methodology (Aim 1). Next, we will validate a priori and novel candidate WS (Aim 2). Case-crossover
methodology will be used, a within-subjects design that uses subjects as their own control. The semi-structured
interview data are analyzed through comparisons of the presence/intensity of hypothesized WS on the day of
the attempt (high-risk case period) to the day prior (lower risk control period). Finally, we will develop and test
an algorithm to detect linguistic signals of specific WS content (Exploratory Aim 3). Natural language
processing and deep learning models of language will be used to detect WS within the narratives. WS for
suicide attempts are extraordinarily difficult to study due the practical challenge of examining the hours
preceding an act of suicide. The project uses innovative qualitative and quantitative methods to address this
challenge in a rigorous fashion. The study is designed to provide scientifically grounded WS to inform clinical
decision-making, patient/family education, and automated risk identification."
10916336,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In this R01 proposal, we outline a comprehensive 5-year research proposal that will support development and rigorous
testing of a scalable intervention to improve integration of geriatric principles into surgical care of older adults with the
goal of improving patient and care-partner quality of life from transitions into and out of the hospital around the time of
surgery. This significant and innovative plan aims to improve care transitions for this high risk patient population as they
are discharged home after major surgery. Background: Surgeons try to prepare and support older adults through the
perioperative transitions to the hospital and back home, with variable success. Most surgeons are not fully equipped to
address geriatric needs that exist among the rising number of older adults presenting to surgical attention. Addressing
health outcomes that older adults prioritize when considering surgery is an important opportunity to improve surgical
care quality in this growing patient population through development of novel interventions. Specific aims and research
design: We aim to develop the first version of myPOSH, a digital intervention to improve the care of older patients
undergoing surgery including development of content and application with methodology for implementation through 1)
interviews with older adults undergoing major surgery and their care-partners when available (up to n=30) (Aim 1.1),
with additional input from 2) key clinical stakeholder focus groups (i.e., surgeons, geriatricians, and nurses) (n=4; at least
24 clinicians) (Aim 1.2). Next, we will examine the preliminary feasibility and acceptability of myPOSH via an open pilot
(n=20 patients, n=2 surgical teams across 2 sites) with exit interviews and pre-post assessments. myPOSH will be refined
(Aim 2). Finally, we will examine the feasibility and acceptability of myPOSH versus usual surgical care (n=84 patients; 42
patients per arm) in a pilot RCT following predetermined benchmarks (Aim 3). These findings will inform a hybrid
efficacy trial through future funding with plans to extend this work to other surgical clinic sites. Relevance: This R01 is in
line with the goal of this funding announcement to develop scalable interventions to improve care transitions among
high risk patient populations. Impact: As surgeons with expertise in surgical systems change, we recognize the critical
need to improve surgical care quality among older adults transitioning home after surgery. Experiences gained through
this proposal are foundational to future research to improve caregiver preparedness and reduce patient anxiety in the
perioperative setting."
10892213,"Of all the potential pathogens around us, we, like other multicellular species, can typically be infected by only a
small subset. However, when a microbe manages to break such host barriers, it can quickly spread through the
new host population. To predict when a pathogen will make a host jump, we need to understand what limits
pathogen adaptation to different host environments.
My research program focuses on investigating the factors that limit the adaptation of microbes to new host
environments. Specifically, I address this question from the perspective of an evolutionary geneticist and
microbiologist. I identify bacterial genetic mechanisms important for colonizing different hosts and use
comparative and functional genomics to understand how they evolve. Recent work from myself and others
demonstrated that both host genetics and the surrounding microbes influence the ability of a pathogen to move
between hosts. The relative importance of host genetics and surrounding organisms as well as interactions
between these factors are largely unknown. I recently developed a study system in the broad host range
bacterial genus Pseudomonas that lays the groundwork for studying what limits the adaptation of pathogens to
new hosts. My lab is now developing methods to identify genome-wide those loci in Pseudomonas important for
colonizing different host environments. We have also curated natural variation data for thousands of
Pseudomonas genomes collected from diverse hosts. Ongoing efforts are determining the associations between
Pseudomonas genetic variation and differences in pathogen specificity.
Over the next five years, the focus of my research program is to determine the relative importance of host
genetics and surrounding microbes in limiting Pseudomonas adaptation to new hosts. To address this question,
I will lead projects under three broad themes: (1) identify how surrounding microbes constrain evolution of
Pseudomonas to a new host (2) determine how the genetic requirements for colonization change across host
species (3) determine how horizontal gene transfer influences Pseudomonas adaptation to new hosts.
Together these three projects will contribute to our understanding of how host genetics and the surrounding
microbes influence Pseudomonas adaptation. I have selected these projects to start my lab because the question
of what limits bacterial adaptation is a question generalizable to all bacteria. The mechanisms we discover are
likely to be relevant to the study of other bacteria as many bacterial species share mechanisms of colonization,
and this work is also relevant more broadly to general questions about niche evolution. My long-term objective
is to use the knowledge gained from these studies to predict which microbes will undergo host jumps."
10834133,"Summary
Previously, we reported that cell-free native extracellular matrix (ECM), synthesized by bone marrow (BM)
stromal cells, significantly promoted the stemness of mouse and human BM-derived mesenchymal stem cells
(BM-MSCs). More importantly, defects in self-renewal, differentiation, and bone formation capacity of aging BM-
MSCs can be completely rescued by culture on young BM-ECM (i.e., made by cells from young donors). In
contrast, old BM-ECM (i.e., made by cells from old donors) failed to support both young and old MSC self-
renewal and differentiation capacity. By proteomic analysis, we found that the matricellular protein Cyr61 was
abundant in young ECM but absent in old ECM. Subsequently, we used genetic methods to down- or up-regulate
the incorporation of Cyr61 during synthesis of young or old BM-ECM and found that Cyr61-depleted young ECM
lost its ability, while Cyr61-replenished old ECM gained its ability, to retain MSC properties. In addition, we
showed that low bone mineral density (BMD) was associated with decreased amounts of Cyr61 in bone tissue
of old mice. More interestingly, the presence of Cyr61 in bone is required for the anabolic effect of intermittent
PTH that by itself up-regulates Cyr61 expression in old mice. The goal of the current proposal is to reverse age-
related bone loss by replenishing a critical matricellular protein component, Cyr61/CCN1, to the aging bone
microenvironment (i.e., stem cell niche). We hypothesize that replenishing Cyr61 to the aging bone matrix will
restore the ability of the MSC microenvironment (niche) to support MSC self-renewal, differentiation, and bone
formation capacity, resulting in an attenuation of bone loss and improvement in bone anabolic response to
intermittent PTH treatment. We are uniquely positioned to test this hypothesis since, in addition to our strong
preliminary data, we have established a unique animal model, bone-specific Cyr61 knockout out (Cyr61‒) mice,
which displays osteopenia at an early age. To test the hypothesis, we will determine the effect of restoring Cyr61
to BM-ECM, produced by cells from Cyr61‒ or old wild type (wt) mice, on its ability to retain/rescue the quantity
and quality of young-/old-BM-MSCs (Aim 1). Then we will determine the efficacy of recombinant Cyr61 (rCyr61),
carried by multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), in reversing both stem cell quantity/quality and bone loss
in Cyr61‒ and old wt mice (Aim 2). Finally, we will compare the efficacy of administering rCyr61 followed by
intermittent PTH versus PTH alone at reversing bone loss in Cyr61‒ or old mice (Aim 3). The proposed study is
highly innovative by testing our novel hypothesis via: 1) novel animal models, bone-specific Cyr61‒ and old wt
mice (natural Cyr61 deficiency with aging), to determine if replenishing Cyr61 to the bone ECM can reverse BM-
MSC function and bone loss; 2) a novel vehicle, MWCNTs, that specifically delivers rCyr61 to the bone matrix;
and 3) testing the synergistic effects of Cyr61 administration prior to intermittent PTH on bone anabolic
metabolism. The proposed study is significant because current osteoporosis treatments mainly focus on
balancing osteoclast/osteoblast activity and have limited efficacy and considerable side effects. The studies
have great potential to benefit both the veteran and general population by providing a new approach for treating
osteoporosis that focuses on restoring the aging stem cell niche, which has not been explored previously."
10926837,"Uterine cancer is the 4th most common cancer in women and the 7th most frequent cause of cancer-related
death. The death rate from uterine cancer is rising faster than for any other tumor. Importantly, uterine cancer
is associated with a profound racial disparity. Compared to white women, black women are significantly more
likely to die from uterine cancer and this disparity is increasing. The overarching goal of this proposal is to
inform cancer control and prevention strategies to reduce the incidence and mortality uterine cancer by
improving the prevention, screening, and treatment of the disease. We will accomplish this goal through a
collaborative modeling consortium in which three groups develop natural history models of uterine cancer.
These models will incorporate known risk factors for uterine cancer and population level changes in the
prevalence of these risk factors over time. The models will include pathways for both favorable prognosis (type
I) uterine cancer as well as more aggressive (type II) neoplasms.
Once developed and validated, we will perform comparative modeling to examine issues of importance to
clinicians and policymakers. First, we will examine currently available and emerging strategies for screening
and prevention of uterine cancer in women. Second, we will examine the harms, benefits, and cost-
effectiveness of treatment strategies for uterine cancer including adjuvant therapy, treatment of metastatic
disease, and treatment of recurrent disease including immunotherapy. Third, we will estimate how changing
epidemiologic factors and social determinants of health influence racial disparities for uterine cancer. Fourth,
we will explore the impact of the rising rate of obesity on incidence and mortality of uterine cancer and develop
novel, web-based tools to determine how state-level obesity control activities influence incidence and mortality.
Finally, we will explore how the declining hysterectomy rate and changing patterns of care for gynecologic
diseases influence uterine cancer incidence and mortality. At the completion of this work, these data will be
widely disseminated to patients, providers, and policy makers and have the potential to significantly impact the
clinical care of women with uterine cancer and to guide cancer control strategies. Further, these models will
serve as an invaluable resource for the uterine cancer community as new clinical questions and challenges
emerge."
10849902,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Iron plays a critical role in both the healthy and diseased retina. The long term goals of the
proposed studies are to understand regulation of retinal iron flux, determine why iron
accumulates in retinal disease, and discover how to protect against retina iron toxicity. Iron is
necessary in the retina for oxidative phosphorylation, membrane biogenesis and retinol
isomerization, but becomes a central producer of oxidative stress when improperly regulated.
Iron toxicity is evident in retinal disease: it causes rapid retinal degeneration following entry into
the eye carried by an intraocular foreign body. Iron accumulation has also been noted in retinal
diseases including AMD, where it may exacerbate oxidative stress. Further, patients with the
inherited disease aceruloplasminemia, caused by mutation of the ferroxidase ceruloplasmin
(Cp), have retinal iron accumulation with RPE pigment abnormalities, and occasionally early
onset macular degeneration. Mice with knockout for Cp and its homolog hephaestin (Heph)
have age-dependent retinal iron overload and degeneration of photoreceptors and RPE.
Evidence from other organs suggests that Cp or Heph can cooperate with the sole plasma
membrane iron exporter, ferroportin (Fpn), to export iron from cells. Yet, results from the
previous funding period indicate that retina-specific knockout of Fpn has no impact on retinal
iron levels while retina-specific knockout of Heph leads to retinal iron accumulation. These data
point to the importance of ferroxidases Cp and Heph for keeping intraocular iron in its ferric
(Fe3+) state. We will test this hypothesis using AAV-Cp gene therapy in the absence of Fpn, as
well as an oxidation resistant form of the lipid DHA, which will be tested for retinal protection
against reactive oxygen species produced by Fe2+."
10840441,"Project Summary/Abstract
Irritability is one of the most common mental health problems in children and adolescents. Moreover, it is one
of the strongest predictors of later psychopathology and functional impairment in adulthood. Irritability can
manifest in a variety of ways, which has recently led some investigators to conceptualize it as consisting of two
components: tonic irritability, defined as persistently angry or grumpy mood; and phasic irritability, defined as
short-lived temper outbursts. Though this distinction has been raised conceptually, research examining
whether tonic/phasic irritability are empirically separable and differ in their clinical correlates, underlying
mechanisms, longitudinal course, and treatment response is limited. A significant obstacle for empirical work in
this area has been that no psychometrically validated measure that differentiates between tonic/phasic
irritability is currently available for research or clinical use. Long-term objectives. I propose to develop and
evaluate the first multi-informant measure of tonic/phasic irritability for school-age children and adolescents.
This measure will fill an urgent gap in the literature by providing a psychometrically-sound, multi-informant
instrument that will advance research on the etiopathogenesis of tonic/phasic irritability and help develop and
evaluate targeted approaches to prevention and treatment. Design. I developed the tonic/phasic scale by 1)
conducting a comprehensive literature search of existing instruments that cover related constructs, 2) utilizing
experts in developmental psychopathology to revise and refine the item pool, and 3) conducting cognitive
interviews with parents of children and adolescents using a combined think-aloud and debriefing methodology.
The proposed project will collect data from five samples including three convenience community samples (a
total of ~800 parents of 6–17-year-old children and ~800 unrelated 13–17-year-old youth) collected through
Qualtrics XM panels, allowing for an iterative scale development process; a longitudinal dataset (~215 parents
of 6-year-olds enriched for irritability) with a wider set of validating measures; and a clinical sample (~150
parents and their ~150 10–17-year-old children in outpatient psychology and psychiatry clinics) to evaluate the
generalizability of the measure to a more severely impaired population. In each sample, participants will
complete a brief survey assessing irritability and emotional and behavioral symptoms. Aims/Methods. The
aims of this project are five-fold: 1) develop and refine a novel multi-informant scale for assessing youth
tonic/phasic irritability using classical psychometric and item-response theory (IRT) analyses; 2) evaluate
convergent and discriminant validity by examining concurrent relationships of tonic/phasic irritability with
existing measures of irritability, parental psychopathology, parenting style, child temperament, and child
psychopathology; 3) assess predictive validity by modeling relationships between tonic/phasic irritability and
later measures of youth psychological problems; 4) evaluate measurement invariance for informant, age,
biological sex, and race/ethnicity; and 5) develop a shortened version of the rating scale using IRT."
10862607,"A lack of knowledge about the initiating moments of tumorigenesis leaves large gaps in our ability to
detect cancer early or develop prevention strategies. Our primary objective of this competitive renewal is to
define, in vivo, the immediate consequences of oncogenic mutations in BRAF during Serrated colon cancer
formation. We will pursue these studies in colon stem cells, the presumed cell-of-origin of colon cancer.
 Work from the previous grant identified new genetic modifiers of Serrated tumorigenesis. We found that
oncogenic BRAFV600E mutations paradoxically cause stem cells to differentiate rather than form tumors.
However, when we inactivated tumor suppressor transcription factors CDX2 or SMAD4, Serrated
tumorigenesis was markedly restored. Excitingly, we found that CDX2 and SMAD4 target genes can be used
to stratify human patients for their susceptibility to Serrated tumors.
 The logical extension of these studies is to understand the molecular mechanisms that occur in stem
cells in response to BRAFV600E mutations. We will focus on the downstream transcriptional effector of BRAF,
pERK, and will leverage the genetic mouse models we created to address the following Aims:
 Our previous work found that the transcription factor CDX2 preserves mature colon identity, with fetal-
specific chromatin regions opening upon CDX2-loss. We predict that pERK takes advantage accessible
chromatin upon CDX2 loss. Aim 1 will compare the activity of pERK in wild type stem cells, and BRAFV600E or
CDX2-mutant stem cells. State-of-the-art –omics approaches will allow first-of-a-kind measurements of pERK
on stem cell chromatin, within hours after the BRAFV600E mutation is expressed from its endogenous locus. We
will measure pERK binding activity, nuclear localization, and dynamic interactions with its protein partners.
 Aim 2 will look at the downstream gene regulatory consequences of the BRAFV600E mutation in stem
cells lacking SMAD4. We previously demonstrated that SMAD4 loss predisposes mice to Serrated tumor
formation, and SMAD4 is frequently mutated in human tumors. We predict that SMAD4 works with pERK to
promote differentiation and suppress stem cell renewal. Epigenomics approaches will map pERK binding to the
genome, and ATAC-seq and RNA-seq will profile changes to chromatin and the transcriptome. Finally, Aim 3
will functionally test a model that the injury/repair cycle in the colon can create a susceptible environment for
BRAF-pERK to drive tumorigenesis, with the prediction that an altered transcriptional network is permissive to
Serrated tumor formation during the injury/repair cycle. These studies would provide important pre-clinical
models to help explain and test therapeutic strategies to suppress Serrated tumor initiation in humans.
 These studies are innovative with cutting edge -omics applications and GEMMs and significant in
exploring untested mechanisms of oncogenic pERK in stem cells. Successful completion of these studies will
have us poised to test therapeutic strategies for the prevention or early detection of Serrated Colon Cancer."
10917121,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The US opioid overdose epidemic has been accompanied by an increase in human immunodeficiency (HIV)
among persons who inject drugs. The co-occurrence of HIV and opioid use disorder (OUD) suggests that a
comprehensive approach to OUD and its infectious complications has the potential to improve outcomes. HIV
pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are evidence-based
approaches that are recommended for persons who inject drugs. Unfortunately, these measures have not
been widely adopted in real-world settings or accessed by persons at-risk. Foundation for the Proposal: The
CHORUS intervention (Comprehensive HIV and Opioid use disorder Response to the Unaddressed Syndemic)
is informed by preliminary research, including: (a) quantitative and qualitative research with persons with
substance use disorder, (b) a randomized controlled trial of a peer-delivered motivational intervention
demonstrating effectiveness in reducing heroin and/or cocaine use, and (c) preliminary studies demonstrating
the feasibility and acceptability of peer-delivered motivational interventions in non-traditional settings. During
the CHORUS pilot phase, we uncovered that PrEP was initiated late in the intervention. Therefore, we are
attempting to accelerate PrEP initiation by providing HIV self-testing (CHORUS +) at baseline. The CHORUS+
intervention includes HIV self-testing, rapid initiation of PrEP and MOUD, and a 6-month peer recovery coach
to support adherence to these medications. Conceptual Model: CHORUS+ is a theory-based, peer-delivered,
mobile phone-supported intervention focused on enhancing uptake and adherence to HIV PrEP (primary
outcome), and receipt of MOUD (secondary outcome) among persons who inject opioids. CHORUS+ aims to
improve behavioral skills and self-efficacy while addressing structural barriers. Summary: The current proposal
seeks to determine the efficacy of a novel intervention to increase the uptake of evidence-based measures to
prevent HIV and treat opioid use disorder. We will compare the CHORUS+ intervention to usual care (passive
referral) among persons who inject opioids (aim 1). In addition, we will examine study implementation to
facilitate potential future dissemination using a mixed-methods process evaluation of CHORUS+ (aim 2). The
study will be performed at Boston Medical Center’s Faster Paths clinic, a low-barrier substance use disorder
bridge clinic, and through Victory Programs, which utilizes a mobile outreach van. The proposed intervention
will recruit from non-traditional settings in order to reach participants who might not be comfortable in office-
based clinics. This project specifically addresses NIDA’s mission of developing effective socio-behavioral
interventions to increase uptake of HIV prevention strategies, and accelerating the adoption of evidence-based
interventions to address substance use and its infectious complications."
10830442,"ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
An estimated 1.7 million children aged 0-14 were living with HIV, and at least 300,000 children were newly
infected with HIV in 2020. Another 120,000 children died from AIDS-related causes during the same period.
Combination therapy with antiretroviral (ARV) drugs has significantly improved AIDS-related morbidity and
mortality. Among all the factors, adherence to HIV treatment pose major challenges in achieving desired
therapeutic outcome. A major barrier to ARV treatment adherence is the lack of dose-flexible pediatric-friendly
formulations. One of the combination ARV drugs recommended for children ≥2 to 12 years is tenofovir disoproxil
fumarate (TDF) and lamivudine (3TC). Dose flexible formulation of TDF-3TC combination is not available.
Pharmacists, thus, have to compound pediatric formulations from adult drug products. However, physicians,
FDA, and NIH alike have raised concerns on dose accuracy, stability, sterility, bioavailability, efficacy, safety,
and consistency of extemporaneous preparations. The dose adjustment/flexibility is difficult to achieve in solid-
dosage forms, as each dose strength must be manufactured separately. However, newer manufacturing
methods such as 3D printing can be used for dose-tailored or flexible solid-dosage forms, which can easily be
set-up/prepared in a clinical hospital environment for pediatric use. Based on the aforementioned considerations,
and support for deployment at Driscoll Children’s Hospital in South Texas, the objective of the proposal is to
demonstrate the feasibility of printing dose-flexible pediatric co-delivery system (printlets) of two drugs, namely
3TC and TDF in a single printlet system. The premise of this proposal is further supported by our preliminary
data on TDF, and published work on isoniazid, lopinavir, diclofenac, and clindamycin. Furthermore, the need for
a pediatric delivery system of antiretroviral drugs is reported in the NICHD 2020-2021 priority list. Thus,
administering TDF/3TC as age-appropriate flexible pediatric co-delivery systems will overcome the limitations of
adult dose manipulations for compounding in pharmacies and address a significant unmet medical need in
children. Aim I involves mechanistic understanding printing pediatric co-delivery systems, and characterization
for quality, stability, and palatability as per FDA and USP requirements. Aim II involves palatability (human),
safety and efficacy evaluation of flexible pediatric co-delivery systems (printlets) by pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics methods. The proposal will advance scientific knowledge of a dose-flexible delivery system
using 3D printing for pediatric HIV treatment that can be applied to other classes of drugs where no pediatric
formulation exists. The successful completion of the proposal will have a significant positive impact on the
realization of the delivery system in clinical use and deployment in hospitals with further development and
regulatory filing to the FDA for broader use. The PI and his team have ample experience with the proposed
studies. The PI led the FDA team of scientists and reviewers through the approval of the first and only 3D printed
drug product (Spritam®)."

Biostatistics refers the application of mathematical and statistical methods to the biological and medical
sciences. Although employment in biostatistics is expected to grow over the next ten years, the percentage of
underrepresented minorities (URM), including Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, American Indian
or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islander ethnic groups, earning graduate degrees in
biostatistics and other STEM-related fields remains low. Invested faculty and peer support and undergraduate
research experiences are shown to be critical to the retention of URM students in STEM majors, as well as
their interest in future careers in STEM-related fields. Currently, no structured evidence-based summer
research opportunities in collaborative biostatistics specific to addiction research exist for URM undergraduate
students. Although generally true for all disciplines, the role of a collaborative biostatistician is particularly
important in addiction research given the types of problems commonly addressed, such as the use of complex
study designs, large amounts of informed missing data and study dropout, along with the need to quantify
complex mechanisms of action or underlying relationships. The specific aims of this proposed research and
education program are to: 1) implement an 8-week summer program for URM undergraduate students in
STEM that generates awareness of the necessity for collaborative biostatisticians in addiction research; and 2)
diversify the field of collaborative biostatistics in addiction research. Guided by Lent, Brown, and Hackett’s
(1994) Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) conceptual framework, the Collaborative Undergraduate
Biostatistics Experience (CUBE) program is built on the following four pillars: 1) training in introductory
biostatistics; 2) training in R programming; 3) professional development; and 4) a collaborative research project
addressing research questions in the area of addiction. Working closely with experienced collaborative
biostatisticians, leading experts in the areas of addiction, peer and graduate student mentors, participants will
be provided the opportunity to learn about the challenges of communicating and working collaboratively with
researchers in a multi-disciplinary team science environment. These activities provide a foundation for
participants to have the confidence and knowledge to apply to, and succeed in, graduate school and careers in
biostatistics and/or addiction research. CUBE participants will: refine their statistical communication and
presentation skills by presenting their research project findings at research symposiums; benefit from engaging
in graduate school application preparation activities; be provided with a one-year membership to the American
Statistical Association (ASA), and thus expand their professional network and opportunities; be encouraged to
attend an academic conference, providing an opportunity to network with other undergraduate and graduate
students, as well as faculty mentors, with similar interests."
10852917,"Project Summary
Diarrhea is the second leading cause of death in children aged <5 years in developing countries, more than
AIDS, malaria, and measles combined. Our long-term goal is to develop effective vaccines against diarrheal
bacteria. The objective of this industrial partnership project is to combine expertise and leadership from
academic vaccine research and industrial vaccine development and manufacturing to accelerate the
development of MecVax, a multivalent cross-protective subunit vaccine for enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli
(ETEC). ETEC bacteria are one of the top five causes of children's diarrhea and the most common cause of
travelers' diarrhea. ETEC is listed as a category B priority pathogen (NIH) and a serious threat of antibiotic
resistance (CDC), and causes >220 million diarrhea clinical cases annually, resulting in stunting and poor
cognitive development in diarrheal children, 1,065,000 years lost due to disability (YLD), 6,894,000 years to
disability-adjusted life-years (DALY), and about 100,000 deaths (many are children < 5 years). ETEC is also a
primary cause of diarrhea in young animals and causes significant economic losses worldwide.
Currently, there are no licensed vaccines against ETEC diarrhea. The development of effective vaccines for
ETEC is a top priority for WHO, UNICEF, and many other public health institutions. By applying an innovative
vaccinology platform, we have constructed two polyvalent proteins and developed a protein-based multivalent
ETEC vaccine candidate, MecVax. MecVax is the only ETEC vaccine candidate that induces protective
antibodies against both ETEC toxins (LT and STa) and the seven most important ETEC adhesins (CFA/I, CS1 -
CS6). Since ETEC bacteria producing LT and/or STa toxin are associated with all ETEC diarrhea cases and
strains expressing adhesin CFA/I or CS1 - CS6 cause > 66% of ETEC clinical cases, the synergy of antitoxin
and anti-adhesin immunity from MecVax provides truly broad protection against ETEC children's diarrhea and
travelers' diarrhea. MecVax is demonstrated to broadly protect against ETEC clinical diarrhea and colonization
of small intestines preclinically. The central goal of this milestone-oriented vaccine development project is to
optimize MecVax vaccine formulation, analytical development, and production processing. The rationale is that
the completion of this application will identify MecVax optimal formulation, optimize upstream and downstream
processing and analytical development, and manufacture vaccine cGLP products, - essential to accelerate
MecVax development. To achieve these goals, we will 1) evaluate MecVax protection against ETEC adherence
and enterotoxicity at different antigen doses, adjuvants, buffers, and shelving conditions, 2) optimize analytical
assays and upstream and downstream processing, 3) manufacture and test MecVax master cell banks, and 4)
perform product production engineering runs and submit MecVax pre-IND application.
The positive impact is that an effective ETEC vaccine will save nearly 100,000 lives and prevent >200 million
diarrheal clinical cases each year, and reduce long-term negative nutritional and developmental impacts."

10907772,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cannabis is the most frequently used illicit drug in the United States. Onset of cannabis use usually occurs
during adolescence, which represents a vulnerable period in neurobiological development. Due to uncertainty
surrounding the long-term consequences of adolescent cannabis exposure, there is mounting concern that
relaxing legal restrictions will result in increased adolescent use. Approximately 30% of users develop
cannabis use disorder (CUD), and nearly half of all regular cannabis users develop cannabis withdrawal
syndrome which is marked by negative affective symptoms and craving that may drive relapse. During
abstinence craving may increase over time or “incubate” resulting in a period of heightened vulnerability to
relapse in response to drug-related cues. Withdrawal symptoms during abstinence are clinically significant
because they may impact efforts to reduce cannabis use, promote use of other substances of abuse, and
adversely influence treatment outcomes. Currently there are no approved pharmacotherapies for CUD. The
primary objective of this proposal is to determine how chronic cannabinoid use in adolescence impacts
glutamatergic transmission and plasticity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), and the contribution of these
adaptations to later relapse-like behavior and craving. Our central hypothesis is that cannabinoid self-
administration and withdrawal induces changes in glutamate transmission and synaptic connectivity in the NAc
that promote negative affective processes and ultimately trigger relapse. To test this hypothesis we will use
behavior, whole mount immunohistochemistry and light sheet microscopy, optogenetic aided neurophysiology,
and chemogenetic manipulation techniques to assess the involvement of pathway specific glutamatergic
neuroplasticity in cannabis seeking. We will use a model of adolescent intravenous D9-tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC) self-administration and withdrawal to confirm the presence of an incubation of drug seeking effect at an
intermediate or protracted withdrawal time point. We will assess somatic and non-somatic symptoms of
spontaneous withdrawal based on alignment with DSM-5 criteria and the Research Domain Criteria framework.
Unbiased mapping of whole brain c-Fos immunoreactivity will be used to identify regional neural activation
associated with cannabinoid withdrawal and cue-reactivity. We will examine input-specific cannabinoid
withdrawal-induced plasticity at glutamatergic synapses in identified D1 and D2 medium spiny neurons in NAc
core and shell coupling in vitro slice electrophysiology with optogenetically evoked EPSCs. Finally, we will
utilize chemogenetic neuromodulation to test the importance of one of these circuits for regulating relapse-like
behavior and endophenotypes of withdrawal. These studies will inform our understanding of the mechanisms
underlying cannabis withdrawal syndrome, an important and understudied facet of CUD, and how glutamate
transmission and synaptic plasticity is altered over the course of withdrawal. This may have important
implications for identifying unique therapeutic targets."

Islet transplantation offers a potential cure for Type 1 diabetes (T1D). Wide adoption of this promising
therapy requires abundant islet supplies and effective immune protection. My laboratory and others
showed that it was feasible to derive insulin-secreting cells from gastrointestinal (GI) tissues.
However, it has not been possible to mass-produce islet-like organoids from human GI tissues for
detailed assessment of their translational potential.
In preliminary studies, we established methods to culture human gastric stem cells (hGSCs) from
biopsy or autopsy samples that can be expanded to billions. We developed a scalable 2-step method
to produce thousands of GINS (Gastric Insulin Secreting) organoids by transient activation of NGN3
and stable expression of PDX1 and MAFA (collectively referred to as NPM factors). GINS organoids
acquired glucose-stimulated-insulin-secretion (GSIS) within 10 days, and upon transplantation,
rapidly reversed diabetes in mice and maintained normoglycemia for over 3 months, with no tumor
formation. Human GINS organoids thus have favorable attributes as a potential cell product for T1D
treatment.
GINS organoids contain 25% of cells that closely resemble pancreatic β-cells but a paucity of GCG+
and SST+ cells. Human islets have 50-75% β-cells, 25-35% α-cells, and 5% δ-cells. Both α- and δ-
cells exert paracrine effects on β-cell section. In this project, we aim to develop new clonal hGSC
lines and novel nanoparticle-based mRNA transduction method suitable for mass production of
organoids that closely mimic human islets in cell composition and function. These studies are based
on preliminary data indicating that hGSC clonal lines are markedly different, with some predominantly
producing β-like or α-/δ-like cells. Their differentiated progenies can thus be combined to yield islet-
like organoids. We will further study the clonal lines for chromatin features and PDX1/MAFA genomic
binding to gain mechanistic insight in GINS formation. Together, these studies constitute a major step
in advancing the long-term goal of developing GINS organoids for T1D treatment."

 We have developed the first validated, gyrencephalic, large animal model of post-
traumatic epilepsy achieving extreme, long-term video EEG digital radiotelemetry, and we have
developed cutting-edge technology allowing single cell imaging in the largest species to date.
Building on our 5 years’ experience, the Large Animal Core aims to transduce the cortex of
swine with or without post-traumatic epilepsy with proteins that report intraneuronal
concentrations of chloride and calcium, surgically implant and maintain imaging ports for the
Microscopy Core allowing for serial, 2-photon imaging, and produce and archive
video/electrographic data and collect and store tissues of swine with or without post-traumatic
epilepsy. In particular, the Large Animal Core will provide surgeries (implant the ECoG, AAV
injection, install the imaging ports, cortical impact, inject extracellular chloride dye, 2-photon
imaging), record video ECoG with real-time analysis, collect tissues, animal husbandry
procedures, regulatory compliance, and facilitation of swine housing resources. The Core
Director and staff will participate in weekly meetings regarding administrative and scientific
matters such as any problem solving any issues that arise, convulsion screening, and
presentations of data."
10912695,"Project Summary
In addition to direct killing of rapidly proliferating tumor cells, radiation therapy (RT) modifies tumor immunity. RT
increases the expression and release of tumor-associated antigens, induces immunogenic cell death, and
releases danger signals and chemokines that recruit immune cells to the tumor microenvironment (TME). RT
can also enhance tumor killing by increasing the number of tumor-infiltrating immunostimulatory cells and
inducing the expression of neoantigens. However, RT also stimulates the recruitment of other myeloid derived
immune cell subsets that can have tumor permissive phenotypes. The overall balance between these immune
stimulatory and suppressive effects of radiation ultimately predicts whether local tumor treatment with RT
generates an effective and durable systemic anti-tumor immune response. We hypothesize that RT (and in
particular SOC CRT) limits the development of long-term anti-tumor immunity in resistant tumors by
disproportionately increasing the number and tumor permissive phenotypes of myeloid derived cells (MDCs) in
the TME. The Washington University MicroEnvironment Tumor Effects Of Radiotherapy (METEOR)
Center will enable testing of this hypothesis via a dynamic Molecular Characterization Trial with closely
integrated Research Projects, Shared Resource Cores, and Cross Training Core. We will leverage our
institutional expertise in genomics, proteomics, tumor metabolism and immunology to take a “deep dive” into
CRT induced tumor and TME co-evolution. Our overall vision is that immunosuppressive SOC CRT associated
changes in the immune TME can be further targeted to improve systemic anti-tumor immune responses after
RT. Although our preliminary data implicates two immune TME cell types, macrophages and dendritic cells,
our research design is intended to allow for detailed study of CRT related effects on multiple cell types within the
TME. As such, our Center can adapt and incorporate new findings in other cell types during the course of funding
of this grant through pilot projects and data sharing. Importantly, tumor cells and the TME are influenced by the
tissue of origin of the tumor. Thus, it is important to use this approach to study multiple tumor types to establish
what are the common (and tumor specific) mechanisms of CRT related immunosuppression. METEOR will thus
serve as a hub to share this approach with other ROBIN Centers studying different tumor types. Since the
analytic approach through our Shared Resource Cores requires only small biopsies, this will allow other Centers
to send limited specimens to us for analysis. Furthermore, through our Administrative and Cross Training Cores,
we will host faculty and trainees from other ROBIN centers and share with them our resources, educational
materials and approach which will bring added value to the ROBIN network. As a result of this work we will be
well positioned to apply for a future NIH T32 focused on training, disseminating and advancing multidisciplinary
informatic partnerships to address critical research gaps in radiation oncology."
10912699,"MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION TRIAL SUMMARY
The standard of care (SOC) for locally advanced cervical cancer, pelvic radiation (RT) with concurrent cisplatin,
is associated with a 30-50% failure rate, and there is no cure for recurrent disease. Our preliminary data suggests
that a complex interaction between macrophages, dendritic cells, and T-cells within the tumor microenvironment
(TME), as remodeled by radiotherapy, may limit the development of anti-tumor immunity and promote
development of treatment resistance in these tumor types. The Washington University (WU) ROBIN Center
(MicroEnvironment Tumor Effects Of Radiotherapy (METEOR)), will create a resource for in tandem single cell
and spatially resolved omics that will be used to study how the immune system co-evolves with tumors during
RT, which will be combined with well-annotated clinical, dosimetric, and imaging data to paint a detailed picture
of RT/TME interactions. Specifically, we will study how standard of care chemotherapy, radiation and combined
chemoradiation remodels TME, and how this contributes to tumor relapse and the development of radiation
resistance. A molecular characterization trial (Comprehensive Radiobiology Assessment TRial
(METEOR-CRATR)) will be initiated to support detailed studies in this space within the context of our two
METEOR Center Projects and lay a foundation for future studies (trans-ROBIN pilot studies, additional inter/intra-
Network collaboration, future P01/R01). We hypothesize that a dynamically adaptable Trial design focused on
deep characterization of small patient cohorts, coupled with a robust infrastructure to enable rapid provision of
samples for analysis, will enable generation of new radiobiological concepts related to changes in the TME in
response to standard of care radiotherapy. We will prospectively evaluate changes in the TME through collection
of longitudinal biospecimen and multimodal clinical data for patients with locally advanced cervical and
pancreatic cancer undergoing standard of care chemoradiotherapy. To allow for optimal collection of data to
support comparisons within and across groups, METEOR-CRATR will be initiated in patient populations where
the standard of care therapy includes radiotherapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy, and where various opportunities
for acquisition of both biopsy and surgical samples during a patient's treatment course naturally exists. We will
also enable a robust iterative infrastructure to support rapid provision of samples and clinical data to enable near
real-time processing and analysis within the Center Shared Resource Cores (SRCs) and Research Projects. We
have developed a responsive system between METEOR-CRATR, SRCs, and Research Projects to enable
efficient specimen and data capture and analysis. Such a system will also support dynamic Trial iteration and
refinement based on new data and evolving challenges."
10912702,"PROJECT 1 SUMMARY (CERVIX)
The standard of care (SOC) for locally advanced cervical cancer, pelvic radiation (RT) with concurrent cisplatin,
is associated with a 30-50% failure rate, and there is no cure for recurrent disease. Most cervical cancers are
caused by infection with Human Papilloma Virus (HPV), and persistent expression of HPV oncogenes supports
a state of chronic stromal inflammation mediated by macrophages. Preclinical studies suggest that tumor
associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant cell type in the tumor microenvironment (TME) after RT
and exhibit “M2-like” phenotypes that suppress the development of anti-tumor immunity. In our previous work,
we demonstrated that cervical tumor 18F-Fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) uptake on pretreatment positron emission
tomography (PET) is associated with increased TAMs with “M2-like” phenotypes in the cervix TME, and that co-
culture of cervix tumor cells with TAMs increases tumor cell glucose uptake. We propose that TAMs and tumor
cells in the TME co-evolve and mutually adapt their glucose and ROS metabolism to optimize tumor growth. In
this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that SOC CRT induces ROS-mediated “metabolic switches” that alter
gene transcription and metabolism in each cell type, providing a therapeutic opportunity to limit this metabolic
co-dependency and improve outcomes after SOC CRT by promoting RT induced anti-tumor immunity. Here we
will use a combination of state of the art single cell and spatially resolved profiling of human tumors together with
state of the are imaging to determine the impact of SOC CRT induced changes in metabolism in tumor cells and
TAMs on CRT sensitivity, and perform mechanistic preclinical studies to determine how this impacts the
development of anti-tumor immunity. In Aim 1 we will determine the longitudinal impact of SOC CRT on
metabolism and inflammatory signaling in cervix tumor cells. Our preliminary data supports targeting CRT
induced upregulation of SOD2 and NRF2 in tumor cells. We will study CRT associated changes in ROS and
mitochondrial metabolism using tumor organoids and novel mouse models. In Aim 2 we will determine the impact
of SOC CRT on TAM and T cell phenotype and function in the cervix TME. We will study the effect of TAM
targeting using novel imaging approaches, antibody depletion and CCR2 inhibitors in mouse models. In Aim 3
we will integrate longitudinal changes in PET imaging features with CRT associated changes in gene expression
to improve patient classifiers and response prediction. In these studies, we will use FDG in addition to 64Cu-
DOTA-ECLi, a novel PET tracer for CCR2+ TAMs. Finally, we will work with a trainee from our Training Core,
METEORITE, to prioritize new leads from our human data. This trainee will explore the contribution of immune
checkpoint blockade (ICB) when added to SOC CRT. ICB is well known to alter metabolism in immune cells,
and we will synthesize our data and approaches to achieve our ultimate goal which is to incorporate
immunometabolism into novel radiosentization strategies. These experiments will optimize a new treatment
combination reprogramming TAM metabolism as a novel means to improve outcomes after SOC CRT + ICB."
10912704,"PROJECT 2 (PANCREAS) SUMMARY
The prognosis for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC) patients is dismal. Unfortunately, attempts at
immunotherapy for PDAC to date have not achieved significant clinical benefits. It is widely accepted that
radiation therapy (RT) can prime anti-tumor immunity by releasing tumor-derived antigens and danger signals,
and this immune priming effect has a crucial role in RT efficacy in multiple cancer types. In contrast, combining
RT with checkpoint immunotherapy has been generally underwhelming in PDAC. It is unclear if this reflects an
inability of RT to prime tumor-specific T cells or a need for additional stimulants that are supportive of T-cell
priming. Dendritic cells (cDCs) are central for generating tumor antigen-specific T-cell responses. In animal
models and human correlative studies, cDCs are crucial for responsiveness to checkpoint immunotherapy and
RT-induced tumor immunity. Our hypothesis is that RT drives divergent effects on local and systemic tumor
immunities through regulation of cDCs. We will directly address this hypothesis, focusing on how DCs and
T-cell responses are co-shaped during SOC RT. We will use a combination of scRNAseq, spatially resolved
protein, metabolomic profiling in human PDAC tissues and mouse models to test the following. In Aim 1, we will
determine the local and systemic impacts of RT on local immune priming by cDCs. These studies will use a
combination of longitudinally collected human tissues from patients undergoing SBRT and genetically
engineered mouse models (GEMMs) to assess the impact of RT on DC phenotype and function. Leveraging our
institutional strengths, we will conduct these studies in three cohorts of prospective and retrospective tissue
collections from human PDAC patients receiving SBRT and conduct mechanistic studies using PDAC GEMMs.
These studies will assess the local impact of SBRT on cDC function. In Aim 2, we will determine the impact of
RT on cDC differentiation and systemic immunity in PDAC patients. Our data in both human PDAC patients and
mouse models demonstrated that key differences in myelopoiesis and cDC development in PDAC can impair
tumor immunity. Furthermore, our preliminary data indicated that SBRT could alter cDC development and
phenotype. In this aim, we will use a combination of human tissues and GEMMs to specifically study how RTs
impact systemic DC development, phenotype and function, and the net impact this has on tumor immunity and
T-cell priming in response to RT. In Aim 3, we will determine the impact of RT on interactions between regional
metabolism and cDC-directed T-cell immunity. RT can have a dramatic impact on tumor and stromal cell
metabolism. In parallel, these metabolic changes can regulate cDC and T-cell survival and function. However,
these interactions have not been well studied in the context of intact PDAC tissues, where regional heterogeneity
in immune infiltrate, hypoxia, and stromal density are dominant players. We will therefore use multiple orthogonal
approaches including CODEX, NIMS, and advanced imaging of human PDAC tissues to spatially resolve the
impact of SBRT on subregional heterogeneities in cellular immunity, stromal composition, and metabolic profiles."

treatment, in-treatment and after treatment with radiation therapy. In doing so, the BLST will empower the
projects and CRATR to test the global hypothesis that standard of care chemo-radiation therapy (CRT) remodels
the tumor microenvironment to support the survival and expansion of radiation resistant tumor cells. We will
provide instrumentation and proven experience for the following characterizations: 1) RNAseq and whole exome
sequencing, 2) single nuclear snRNAseq and single nuclear snATACseq, 3) targeted SureQuant protein mass
spectrometry, 4) NIMS-based spatial metabolomics and 5) spatial proteomics by CODEX. The BLST is not a
stand-alone core facility, but rather functions integratively and synergistically across METEOR. Tumor and blood
samples originate within the CRATR molecular characterization trial and from pre-clinical models within the
Projects. The BLST will ensure sample quantity, quality, storage and tracking before analysis. Through a suite
of pipelined commercial and custom computation, raw data produced in the BLST will be searched, statistically
scored, integrated and bioinformatically analyzed. Raw and processed data will be transferred to the Data
Management DST shared resource for further integration with clinical annotation and radiomics, as well as for
storage and dissemination across the ROBIN consortium. Reciprocally, the DST shared resource will provide
real-time feedback to the BLST for on-the-fly prioritization and pipeline adjustments. A direct line between the
BLST and Projects enables real-time integration in guiding biological insight. Finally, the BLST will directly
empower the Cross Training Core through associated faculty teaching and mentorship, as well as by providing
various datatypes for trainee processing, integration and interpretation. To accomplish these objectives, we
thematically organized the BLST across two Specific Aims. In Specific Aim #1, we will leverage optimized
workflows to extract and comprehensively detect and quantify biomolecules from the METEOR CRATR clinical
samples. As planned, the BLST will process: 15 samples for combined scRNAseq and scATACseq, 155 samples
for scRNAseq, 70 samples for SureQuant targeted MS, 115 samples for NIMS metabomic imaging, and 85 for
CODEX spatial proteomics. In Specific Aim #2, we will ensure adherence to principles of rigor and reproducibility
and transparency. Data points will be integrated across platforms, space and time. Bioinformatic enrichment
analyses will be used to annotate the resulting maps, including responding signaling pathways, protein functions,
druggability, and disease associations. Finally, the BLST will collaborate across ROBIN centers to share its
expertise and for continued optimization, data reporting and discovering of radiation biology."

The METEOR Data Synthesis and Transfer (DST) shared resource provides expertise and systems for
synthesizing data from across all data sources in METEOR and enabling the ability to transfer the synthesized
data into the larger NCI Data ecosystem and repositories. DST addresses the critical issue of aggregating multi-
omics data, imaging, radiotherapy, and clinical data as well as enabling these data to be shared in a user-friendly
manner. With the successful completion of the aims outlined, we will ensure that the collection and management
of patient-derived data is performed in a manner consistent with FAIR and TRUST principles.
We will augment CIELO, a HIPAA-secure open science platform for health research, to support the workflows
and data types needed for ROBIN. CIELO allows diverse end-users to share, discover, and adapt/adopt
“bundles” of health information, such as multi-scale, longitudinally defined phenotypes. This will serve as a
comprehensive and “end-to-end” solution for enabling Trans-ROBIN data-centric research collaborations
involving multiple ROBIN Centers and beyond. We will add: (1) the capability to ingest the data from multiple
sources and then harmonize and integrate the data by creating consistent identifiers for patients, tissues, and
sample; (2) API-based interfaces with a number of internal platforms and systems such as REDCap, XNAT
OpenSpecimen, and institutional EHR warehouse; (3) addition of support for external data export to other data
repositories in the NCI data ecosystem.
We will deploy and enhance XNAT to support imaging and radiation therapy data in ROBIN and integrate with
CIELO. XNAT is a web-based software platform designed to facilitate common management and productivity
tasks for imaging and associated data. It consists of an image repository to store raw and post-processed
images, a database to store metadata and non-imaging measures, and user interface tools for accessing,
querying, visualizing, and exploring data. We will enhance XNAT to store radiation therapy DICOM formats (RT
Structure Set, RT Dose, Segmentation Objects) and to visualize radiation therapy annotations in XNAT’s web-
based imaging viewer. We will fully integrate XNAT with CIELO via XNAT’s extensive REST API.
We will ensure that the collection and management of patient-derived data is performed in a manner consistent
with FAIR and TRUST principles. All METEOR data (eCRFs, biospecimen availability & characterization) will be
aggregated into CIELO and XNAT, using REST interfaces, and automated data extraction from our Research
Data Core, as well as manual upload capabilities. Processed results of the METEOR-BLST team’s genomics,
transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics analyses, including bulk, single-cell, and spatial experiments,
will be uploaded into CIELO."
10908461,"Project summary/abstract
Decisions an animal makes on the basis of multi-sensory input are crucial to its survival. How do neural circuits
resolve conflicts to choose among available behaviors while receiving multiple and variable inputs? The
navigational behaviors of larval Drosophila form a promising model in which to relate neural activity and behavior.
Powerful genetic reagents are available in Drosophila to target nearly arbitrary subsets of 10,000 neurons that
make up the larva’s central nervous system (~3, 000 in the brain hemispheres), and an EM reconstruction of this
network is almost complete. The larva’s cuticle is semi-transparent, and the entirety of its representative insect
brain is optically accessible for in vivo interrogation or manipulation.
Even a simple organism like the larva responds variably to seemingly identical stimulus presentations. What is
the origin of this variability? This question can be phrased using the language of information theory. If I repeatedly
present the same stimulus and observe different behaviors, then the stimulus does not contain full information
about the behavior. But directly measuring the activities of the motor neurons that control movement would
always allow one to predict the behavior; these neurons have more informationabout the behavior than is present
in the stimulus, and this extra information originates somewhere in the nervous system.
The task of finding where and how variability originates in larva’s tractable nervous system requires an integrated
approach in describing a behavior, identifying which neurons are involved, resolving how circuit activity encodes
those behaviors, and discovering the mechanisms generating these neural transformations. To achieve this task,
I have developed two techniques of neural circuit interrogation: an optogenetic reverse-correlation behavioral
assay that can determine the role of any targeted neuron in decision making, and a first ever two-photon tracking
microscope that can record the neural activity as larva freely navigates its sensory environments.
In this project, I will decode the circuitry underlying the larva’s navigational responses to uni- and multi-sensory
input. In many neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, dyslexia,
and ADHD, the processing of multisensory information is compromised, perhaps from abnormalities in the neural
circuits that are responsible for integrating sensory information. This research will advance our understanding of
the neural basis of multisensory decision-making, which will allow us to better understand the defects in
information processing that occur during disease."
10917226,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The genomic difference between individuals is estimated to be approximately 0.5% of base pairs, but this small
diversity can drastically affect the interpretation of both genome- and downstream proteome-level data. While
most germline variants between individuals are neutral, there are thousands of known genetic disorders in
humans linked to specific germline variants. Similarly, somatic variations are a central hallmark of cancer,
where mutations may cause marked phenotypic consequences in tumors as so-called “driver mutations”, but
most genetic variants in tumors have little or no observable effect. Our lab is interested in understanding the
effects of germline and somatic variants at the proteome level and studying changes in variant abundance over
time. We believe a greater understanding of which genetic variants have molecular phenotypes will lead to
improved understanding of clinically actionable features of diseases. Recent advances in proteomics have
yielded a data independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) as a powerful new tool for quantitative
studies. We have demonstrated that it is possible to accurately and consistently measure genetic
variant-containing peptides (GVPs) with DIA-MS. In this proposal we will develop new bioinformatics tools to
interpret GVPs using DIA-MS both to improve our sensitivity and specificity. By working with clinical
collaborators to study genetic variants in amyloidosis, we hope to improve both typing and outcomes in
patients carrying specific genetic variants. Furthermore, focusing on Transthyretin, the most common
amyloidogenic protein, we will use mutagenized libraries to study variants in high-throughput. With this data,
we will class the massive number of observed Transthyretin variants of unknown significance as either likely
benign or likely pathogenic. This protein is an ideal candidate for demonstration because several Transthyretin
variants have known clinical outcomes, allowing us to validate our approach. Taken together, these
bioinformatic and analytical tools, coupled with validation in a disease with both known and unknown biology
driven by genetic variants, will help us build powerful tools to study genetic diseases from a new proteomic
viewpoint."

Stroke is the world’s second-leading cause of death. By 2030 an estimated 122.4 million people world-wide will
be affected while stroke-related medical costs in the US alone are projected to exceed $180 billion. Furthermore,
stroke itself is only the most acute manifestation of cerebrovascular disease, which also causes chronic
progressive deterioration in brain function, including vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia
(VCID). Despite a pressing need for novel treatments, the precise biological pathways that lead to brain ischemia
and hemorrhage, the response of the brain to injury, and the brain’s capacity for recovery remain poorly
understood. Imaging provides crucial and quantifiable measures of these processes. Without imaging it is
impossible to characterize the location of the brain affected, quantity of brain tissue involved, or amount of brain
swelling/edema. Furthermore, serial images of the same patient over time capture dynamic physiology such as
infarct growth or hemorrhage growth, which are both crucial to studying injury and recovery. The International
Stroke Genetics Consortium (ISGC) was founded to harness human genetics to identify novel biological
pathways that can ultimately lead to effective treatments for stroke. Indeed, candidate drug treatments supported
by evidence from human genetics are substantially more likely to achieve FDA approval. The ISGC’s
commitment to large harmonized data sets, open data sharing and collaborative culture has led to the discovery
of all of the robustly supported risk genes for common forms of stroke to date, many of which are already being
studied as the basis for novel treatments. In 2017 the ISGC launched the Cerebrovascular Disease Knowledge
Portal (CDKP) (R24NS092983) to share genetic data freely with the research community in a manner adherent
to FAIR Data Principles. A major limitation of this resource is the absence of brain images. For this proposed
biomedical data repository cooperative agreement (U24) we will aggregate brain imaging and genetic data
according to FAIR data principles from an estimated 30,000 individuals with stroke and share these data
according to FAIR data principles. Building on the established Stroke Neuro-Imaging Phenotype Repository
(SNIPR) at Washington University, our program will transform the CDKP into the imaging CDKP (iCDKP),
providing the global community with a single FAIR access point to genetic, phenotypic, and imaging data.
Milestone-driven aims will: 1) Aggregate high value stroke imaging datasets from across the international
investigator community; 2) Implement FAIR data sharing practices and procedures; 3) Engage the research
community with repository. Our team, led by the PIs for CDKP and SNIPR is well-situated to execute this project
given that we have developed this proposal in consultation with the international stroke research community to
ensure broad support and maximum response to their anticipated needs."

Serotonin (5-HT)-releasing neurons in the mammalian mid/hindbrain are critical for fundamental behaviors and
cognitive processes, including emotional control, arousal, and motor control. Selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors (SSRIs) increase brain 5-HT levels and are the most commonly prescribed treatment for major-
depression in humans. However, our understanding of the mechanisms by which 5-HT influences synapses,
cells, and circuits is limited, prohibiting improvement of depression therapeutics. A major target of 5-HT
neurons is the lateral habenula (LHb), a subcortical structure principally implicated in evaluating the outcome
(positive or negative) of an action. The LHb is the only brain region that shows consistent hyperactivity several
rodent models of chronic stress and additional studies have recently refined this observation indicating “burst-
firing” in LHb is causally related several behavioral phenotypes (including anhedonia) following chronic stress.
Recently, using single-cell transcriptome wide sequencing, we genetically defined the neuronal subclasses
within the LHb for the first time revealing cell-type specific expression of both 5-HT receptors and genes
related to burst-firing. Our central hypothesis is that 5-HT release dynamically modulates the habenula circuit
though neuron-type specific expression of 5-HT receptors and that burst-firing in specific, genetically defined
LHb neuron-types is required for anhedonia following chronic stress. This proposal seeks to 1) identify the
neuron-type(s) in the LHb that exhibit burst-firing in vitro and in vivo, 2) determine how 5-HT modulates
neuron-types and local connectivity within the LHb and 3) define the neuron-types in the LHb required for
chronic stress induced anhedonia. By revealing how 5-HT modulates habenular circuits, the proposed work
will provide a comprehensive understanding of the cellular and circuit targets of this important neuromodulator.
These findings will form the foundation for understanding the principal mechanisms by which SSRIs impact
synapses and circuits of the LHb, uncovering new avenues for therapeutic intervention in major depressive
disorder and other neurological disorders treated by these drugs."

 The Golgi complex plays a prominent role in secretory and endocytic trafficking in eukaryotic cells
and is key to the biosynthesis of glycoconjugates (glycoproteins and glycolipids) that are essential for
life. Golgi resident proteins, such as glycosyltransferases and sugar nucleotide transporters, are precisely
distributed across the Golgi stacks by recycling mechanisms that counteract the flow of ongoing vesicular
transport. Dysfunction in these mechanisms, or their hijacking by viruses and toxins, is known to have
serious consequences for human health, leading to congenital disorders of glycosylation, cancers, and
immune dysfunction.
 Membrane proteins residing in various Golgi compartments are well annotated; however, the mecha-
nistic basis of how most Golgi proteins are selected for recycling, or how these processes are regulated
are poorly understood. My lab is interested in uncovering these fundamental mechanisms governing
Golgi homeostasis using a multifaceted approach combining genetics, flow-cytometry, imaging, in vitro
reconstitution, and proteomics. In preliminary results, we have identified novel transmembrane compo-
nents orchestrating recycling of specific subsets of Golgi enzymes. Our findings have opened doors for
interrogating new players and dissecting the mechanisms critical to maintain Golgi identity and function.
Over the next five years, our goals are to (1) identify novel recycling receptors required at different Golgi
compartments and establish a systematic map of the intra-Golgi recycling network, (2) determine how
the transmembrane receptors engage with their cargos, and (3) define the novel functions of a disease-
associated membrane transporter in solute transport and protein recycling in the Golgi. The combined
results of our experiments will elucidate how multiple recycling pathways sustain normal Golgi function,
and how this homeostasis is disrupted in human disease."

this composition is a competition among microbes that is mediated by naturally produced antimicrobial
compounds, that help shape which microbes are included or excluded from the community. Notably, many key
microbes found in these communities are sensitive to the natural antimicrobial compounds produced therein.
This is especially true for fungi, which are particularly vulnerable to many classes of toxic antifungal
compounds produced within microbial communities. Despite this, fungi play key roles in host-associated
microbial communities for plants, animals, and humans. In order to explain how such sensitive organisms gain
access to antimicrobial replete spaces, my lab discovered a class of microbial interactions whereby bacterial
members of the community that are resistant to antimicrobial compounds extend protection to physically
associated fungal partners. Such bacterial partners act as “toxin sponges,” sequestering natural antimicrobial
compounds, in addition to providing protection against frontline antifungal drugs used clinically against fungal
pathogens. The discovery of bacterial partners protecting their host fungi provides an unstudied avenue that
can be applied to A) predicting how microbial communities form and B) dissecting new mechanisms of
resistance to antifungal drugs whereby resistance originates from a bacterial partner.
My lab focuses on developing a model system based on this type of symbiosis, making use of a co-isolated
fungal-bacterial pairing. The fungus, Aspergillus calidoustus, was found physically associated with a novel
bacterium we named Paraburkholderia edwinii. We have rendered the bacterium genetically tractable and are
working to do the same with the fungus. We are interested in discovering the mechanisms at work for
protection on three levels. First, at the level of the bacterium, we are characterizing how the bacterium
processes and detoxifies antifungal compounds. Second, at the level of the bacterial-fungal interface, we are
interested in understanding how signals of fungal stress are communicated to the bacterium to activate the
protection response. Finally, at the level of the mixed bacterial-fungal co-colony, we are focused on
understanding how antifungal drug flow is manipulated through the fungal mycelial structure to bacterial
aggregates that form within where detoxification of the drugs occurs. Beyond the mechanisms involved in this
pairing, we aim to co-isolate bacterial-fungal pairs from clinical samples to identify which bacterial members of
microbial communities provide safe harbor for associated fungi, and to what classes of antifungal compounds
such partnerships can defend against."

 HIV-1 transcriptional inhibitors have immense potential in functional cure approaches and could transform the
way we treat HIV infections. Unlike current antiretroviral therapy (ART), transcriptional inhibitors offer the
prospect of reducing residual viremia derived from reservoir of long-lived cells containing integrated proviruses,
likely reducing ongoing the chronic immune activation, inflammation and HIV-associated co-morbidities still
experienced by ART-adherent individuals living with HIV. Furthermore, we believe transcriptional inhibitors are
amenable to block-and-lock functional cure approaches, aimed at the durable suppression of HIV in the absence
of daily therapy, through permanent epigenetic silencing of integrated proviruses. This hypothesis was founded
on the activity of the potent Tat inhibitor didehydro-Cortistatin A (dCA). In in vitro and in vivo models of HIV
latency, dCA inhibition of HIV transcription over time prompts the viral promoter into deep transcriptional
inhibition, limiting viral reactivation upon treatment interruption or with latency reactivating agents (LRAs).
Despite their great potential, there are still no HIV transcriptional inhibitors in the clinic, and challenges with the
cost of large-scale production of dCA are slowing its progression towards clinical studies.
 Here we propose to investigate the repurposing the FDA approved aldosterone antagonist Spironolactone (SP)
for HIV transcriptional inhibition. An off-target activity of SP is the degradation of the XPB subunit of the general
transcription factor TFIIH, a key player in RNAPII initiation at the transcriptional start site (TSS) of genes. We
demonstrated in vitro that SP treatment or shRNA knockdown of XPB selectively inhibits HIV transcription and
blocks viral reactivation from latency without global transcriptomic defects. This study highlighted the host factor
XPB as a novel drug target and SP as a potential block-and-lock agent. Here we propose to explore the potential
of SP, alone or in combination with dCA, as a block-and-lock agent in the humanized bone-marrow, thymus liver
(BLT) mouse model of HIV infection by: 1) Determine the relationship between SP treatment length with residual
viremia levels in tissues and correlates of chronic immune activation/inflammation in HIV infected ART-
suppressed BLT mice.; 2) Assess the ability of SP to maintain deep latency as a single drug in the absence of
ART and study viral resistance evolution; 3) Impact of dCA and SP in combination as front-line therapy on the
size of the established viral reservoir and time to viral rebound. We predict that longer treatment lengths of HIV
infected BLT mice with SP will correlate with improved reduction of low-grade HIV persistent transcription from
the viral reservoir and likely chronic immune activation. Importantly, we seek to demonstrate that once deep
transcriptional suppression is established, SP alone blocks viral rebound. In addition, when used as front-line
therapy we expect a reduction in the size of the established viral reservoir and the combination with dCA will
improve the outcome. This study will provide an important proof-of-concept for the use of transcriptional inhibitors
to treat people living with HIV and explore optimal experimental settings to be tested in future clinical trials"

Advances in our understanding of the biology of cancer have the potential to lead to significant breakthroughs in
cancer diagnosis and treatment; however, the translation of basic science discoveries to clinical advancement
has been impaired by the dichotomous training of basic scientists and clinicians. Thus, there is a compelling
need for an enhanced mentored research training program that will bridge the gap between training in rigorous
scientific investigation following the scientific method and compassionate clinical care for the patient. We propose
a Training Program in Cancer Biology that will take advantage of the outstanding resources, high caliber of
investigators, and close collaboration between cancer biologists and clinicians at the Winship Cancer Institute of
Emory University, Georgia’s first and only NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center, to provide a unique,
individualized, and multi-faceted training experience to support the development of postdoctoral trainees in
acquiring the knowledge and skills to address the most important biological questions and clinically significant
problems so that they can make transformative discoveries to improve quality of care for patients with cancer.
The objective of the Emory Training Program in Cancer Biology is to provide postdoctoral trainees with the
infrastructure, resources, training, experience, and mentorship to acquire the depth of knowledge and critical
skills in cancer biology research combined with the practical exposure and understanding of clinical concepts to
initiate an impactful independent research program that will translate novel insights in cancer biology into
improvements in clinical care. Aims of the training program include: 1) Organized research training, 2)
Comprehensive formal and informal didactics, 3) Clinical exposure through tumor boards and clinics, 4) Career
development activities, and 5) Plan for transition to independence. The program will train two new postdoctoral
trainees in the first year followed by an additional two trainees in the second year for a total of four trainees per
year by the second year. Postdoctoral trainees will be rigorously selected from an exceptionally strong and broad
applicant pool of PhD and/or MDs within the first two years of their postdoctoral training and will complete 12-24
months of full-time mentored research. Trainees will have the opportunity to engage in independent research in
the labs of a multidisciplinary group of 22 well-funded and experienced Mentors and junior Mentors paired with
a senior co-Mentor from 10 basic science and clinical departments who are all full members of three
complementary and synergistic research programs of the Winship Cancer Institute: 1) Cell and Molecular Biology,
2) Cancer Immunology, and 3) Discovery and Developmental Therapeutics. All trainees will be required to form
a Mentoring Committee with at least one clinical mentor. Outstanding institutional commitment and focus on
inclusive excellence includes support for an additional postdoctoral trainee position per year for the recruitment
of an underrepresented trainee, salary support for the PI, administrators, and trainees, and Office of Postdoctoral
Education resources. This program intends to train the next generation of cancer scientific leaders."
10927336,"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is an age-related non-Alzheimer dementia characterized by progressive
neuronal loss in the frontotemporal lobes. A subset of FTD is defined by the pathology of protein inclusions
positive for Fused in Sarcoma (FUS), thus named FUS-FTD. FTD and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) share
a wide spectrum of clinical, pathological and genetic features. Pathogenic mutations of FUS cause both ALS and
FTD, and FUS proteinopathy is also detected in sporadic diseases. FUS is primarily in the nucleus, but the
protein with a disease-causing mutation mislocalizes and accumulates in the cytoplasm. Protein aggregates
induced by FUS mutations may sequester other proteins to compromise cellular functions, resulting in impaired
neurons. We recently showed that FTD/ALS mutations of FUS suppressed protein translation and hyper-activated the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) of mRNAs. The hypothesis to be tested in this project is that the
dysregulation of protein translation and mRNA surveillance contributes to cortical neuron loss in FUS-FTD.
 Three specific aims are designed to test the hypothesis using in vitro and animal models as well as FTD
patient tissues. Aim 1 is to determine how mRNA NMD and protein translation are perturbed by pathogeneic FUS
mutations in FTD mouse models and patient tissues. We will determine whether NMD factors and translation-related proteins are sequestered in FUS inclusions in forebrain neurons in R521G FUS transgenic mice at
different ages. We will measure mRNA turnover rates and protein translation efficiency in R521G FUS mice and
correlate the perturbations to neuronal dysfunction and FTD disease progression. Moreover, we will examine
whether NMD factors and protein translation proteins are sequestered in FTD patient tissues. Aim 2 is to identify
specific proteins suppressed by pathogenic FUS in FTD mice. We will apply the puromycin labeling in FTD mice
and use the proteomic approach to identify changes in protein translation impacted by mutant FUS in forebrain
neurons. In addition, actively translated mRNAs will be identified and quantified in polysome fractions using RNA-Seq. Results from the –omics approaches will be integrated for pathway analysis to reveal whether pathogenic
FUS impairs proteins in specific pathways, providing novel insights into the FTD etiology. Aim 3 is to elucidate the
significance of RNA binding and post-translational modifications in the dysfunction of pathogenic FUS. We will
use a cohort of RNA binding-deficient mutations in an optogenetic Cry2olig-FUS-mCherry system to examine
the significance of RNA binding in FUS inclusion formation and dysfunction in cortical neurons. We recently
found FUS is acetylated at residues critical to RNA binding, we will test how acetylation-null and -mimicking
mutations affect FUS inclusions, NMD and protein translation. In addition, we will also examine whether
pathogenic FUS forms RNA-dependent and -independent inclusions that produce different levels of toxicity to
neurons. The proposed experiments will thoroughly examine a novel disease mechanism using innovative
approaches. Completion of our proposed work will help elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying FUS FTD."

Mitochondria are essential for cardiomyocyte (CM) differentiation and cardiac morphogenesis. Mutations in
genes encoding mitochondrial proteins frequently result in congenital heart disease, highlighting the need to
elucidate key molecular pathway(s) in mitochondrial homeostasis during heart development. Protein Tyrosine
Phosphatase localized to the Mitochondrion 1 (PTPMT1) is a dual-specificity mitochondrial phosphatase
encoded by nuclear DNA. PTPMT1 is exclusively localized to mitochondria, being anchored to the inner
mitochondrial membrane. PTPMT1 is expressed in CMs throughout several developmental stages. To
determine the role of PTPMT1 in CMs, we generated a Ptpmt1 constitutive CM-specific knockout (cKO) mouse
model. Our preliminary data revealed that Ptpmt1 cKO mice display embryonic lethality. Ptpmt1 cKO mice
displayed thinner compact zone myocardium, with decreased CM proliferation. We also observed significantly
decreased mitochondrial respiration rate and abnormal mitochondrial morphology in Ptpmt1 cKO hearts,
demonstrating that PTPMT1 plays a critical role in developing CMs and in maintaining normal mitochondrial
homeostasis. We also examined previously described PTPMT1 substrates in Ptpmt1 cKO hearts relative to
controls, but could find no evidence to support them being direct substrates of PTPMT1 in CMs. To gain further
insight into pathways affected by loss of PTPMT1, we performed RNA-seq analysis of Ptpmt1 cKO hearts.
Bioinformatics analysis revealed that loss of PTPMT1 significantly activated the Activating Transcription Factor
4 (ATF4) pathway. ATF4 controls expression of a wide range of adaptive genes that allow cells to survive
periods of mitochondrial stress. However, under persistent stress conditions, ATF4 promotes induction of cell-
cycle arrest, apoptosis and senescence. Notably, reduced expression of ATF4 in global Atf4-haplodeficient and
smooth muscle-specific Atf4 knockout mice attenuates ER stress and reduces medial and atherosclerotic
calcification, highlighting new opportunities afforded by favoring a stress-relief adaptive effect over a
maladaptive effect by modulating ATF4 activation. The foregoing evidence leads us to the hypothesis that
PTPMT1 plays an essential role in cardiac development through modulation of specific substrates, and that
partial loss of ATF4, activated in response to mitochondrial stress in Ptpmt1 knockout CMs, may ameliorate,
but complete loss of ATF4 may exacerbate, Ptpmt1 cKO phenotypes. Accordingly, our specific aims are to: 1.
Elucidate the role of PTPMT1 in CM mitochondrial homeostasis and cardiac development and function by
analyzing Ptpmt1 cKO mice, and to identify endogenous substrates of PTPMT1 in CMs by performing
unbiased lipidomics and phosphoproteomics analyses; and 2. Determine the consequences of partial or
complete loss of ATF4 in CMs on phenotypes of Ptpmt1 cKO mice by analyzing CM-specific Ptpmt1
knockout/Atf4 heterozygous (hcKO) knockout mice and CM-specific Ptpmt1/Atf4 double knockout (dcKO) mice."

This proposal is a resubmission of a renewal application that has been supported by NHLBI for nearly four decades.
Support for eight postdoctoral trainee positions is requested in this renewal application, as has been present
during the current funding period.
The overriding goal of our program remains to provide the highest caliber training of postdoctoral trainee
scientists and physician-scientists, to build the pipeline of tomorrow’s cardiovascular researchers. Our trainees
are instilled with expertise so that they can solve cardiovascular problems using multidisciplinary approaches,
as they are mentored by the excellent faculty at University of California, San Diego (UCSD), one of the top
research institutions in the world. The postdoctoral fellows emerging from our rich academic environment are
imbued with the ultimate goal to seek long term success in academia, industry, government, or non-profit sectors.
There is clear continued need for this program since cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of
death globally, according to the W.H.O., and is also among the top causes of mortality and morbidity in the U.S.
This obligates our program, our institution, and the United States, to train investigators who will advance the
forefront of cardiovascular biomedicine.
No other training mechanisms exist at UCSD that provide support and training of postdoctoral trainees in
the unique and specific cardiovascular disciplines of this grant. The Guiding Principles for the program are
embedded in the rich history of this program and propelled us to maintain our original title of the grant - “Training
in Cardiovascular Physiology and Pharmacology.” Yet, we highlight that this T32 program continuously
evolves and seeks improvement. It provides broad exposure to the study of cardiovascular basic biology,
physiology, disease pathobiology, and related translational pursuits. Primary areas that the program focuses on
are 1) cardiac signaling, 2) cardiac development, regeneration, and stem cell biology,
3) cardiac genetics and epigenetics, 4) cardiac bioengineering, and 5) cardiac clinical and translational focused
biology. Within these areas of focus we foster exposure of the trainees to the most modern, innovative, and
emerging technologies to accelerate their hypothesis driven discoveries. This might include use of human stem
cell-based model systems, omics-based approaches, computational sciences, and big data informatics, and how
best to translate from bench to the bedside. During the success of this T32 program over the last forty years of
continuous support, it has been instrumental in training many of the leaders in cardiovascular biology at UCSD,
and also has had broad impact on producing leaders throughout the country in both academia and industry."
10894076,"Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), which includes alcohol-associated cirrhosis (AAC) and alcoholassociated
hepatitis (AH), is now the leading indication for liver transplant (LT) in the US. Early LT (elT),
defined as LT evaluation with <6 months of alcohol abstinence, is associated with acceptable outcomes for AH
in retrospective studies. However, prospective, multi-center data including biopsychosocial factors on elT for
all advanced ALO in racially, culturally, and socioeconomically diverse populations are lacking. It is known that
alcohol cessation is the most important factor influencing survival in ALD, and integrated alcohol use disorder
(AUD)/ALD care is critical to help patients achieve abstinence, yet the degree of care integration and how this
influences post-LT outcomes has not been systematically studied. Knowledge gaps in elT for ALO include: a)
limited data on who gets referred for elT and referral barriers; b) lack of standardized biopsychosocial
measures and outcomes; and c) minimal stakeholder involvement beyond LT providers. There is an urgent
need to (1) define factors influencing elT referral, (2) develop risk prediction models of key patient-centered
outcomes, (3) incorporate validated biopsychosocial measures into models, and (4) evaluate the impact of
integrated care on outcomes following elT. For example, The INTEGRATE collaborative, comprised of
diverse, multidisciplinary clinicians and researchers from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center,
University of Michigan, University of Miami, and Columbia University-Weill Cornell Medicine, is ideally
positioned to address these urgent research needs. Collectively, we have developed a distinctive investigator
team with diversity in: (1) career stage (2) sex and race/ethnicity, (3) clinical and methodological expertise in
ALD, AUD, LT, behavioral research, risk modeling, data harmonization, health disparities, causal inference,
and mixed-methods research, and (4) documented track record of NIH funding in LT access, organ allocation,
LT outcomes and healthcare disparities, and NIAAA funding in ALDI AUD. Our large volume transplant centers
with established protocols for elT for ALD applied to highly diverse populations will facilitate the following aims:
1) characterize and develop risk prediction models for transplant-free survival among those with limited access
to LT to define those in greatest need of eLT referral and listing; 2) evaluate barriers and facilitators to referral
for elT in ALD; 3) apply causal inference approaches to observational data to evaluate biopsychosocial factors
and develop risk models predictive of outcomes at key timepoints in elT for ALD; 4) define stakeholder
perceptions and preferences for selection and outcomes in elT for ALD; and 5) evaluate how integrated care
processes influence outcomes in elT for ALD. At the conclusion of this work, we will have collaboratively: (1)
defined factors for referral and waitlisting for elT in ALD (selection), (2) identified which biopsychosocial
factors are causally related and predictive of outcomes most important to stakeholders (outcomes) and (3)
determined how integrated care influences stakeholder-relevant outcomes in elT for ALD (management)."

 Episodic memory declines substantially and, relative to other forms of memory, disproportionately, with age.
Understanding the cognitive and neural bases of age-related episodic decline in healthy subjects is important
because even the modest impairment (by clinical standards) typical of healthy individuals entering their 70’s is
sufficient to have a detrimental impact on quality of life. Identifying the specific cognitive processes, and their
neural substrates, which are most responsible for age-related memory decline is a crucial precursor to the
development of potential rehabilitative interventions. Equally important, a full understanding of the much more
severe memory impairments characteristic of age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s
Disease will be difficult to achieve without knowledge of how memory and its neural substrates vary over the
course of the healthy lifespan. The aim of the present research is to investigate the possible role in age-related
memory decline of the strength of encoding-related neural selectivity (neural differentiation) and retrieval-
related neural reinstatement, as well as the relationship between encoding- and retrieval-related neural activity.
The starting point for the proposed research is recent findings indicating that, i) neural selectivity and
reinstatement are weaker in older than in younger adults, are strongly correlated regardless of age and, in the
case of selectivity, predict memory performance across- subjects, and ii) differences in the locations of the
peaks of category-selective encoding- and retrieval-related activity (the ‘anterior shift’) are exaggerated in older
adults and, in the parahippocampal cortex, correlate negatively across subjects with memory performance.
 Building on these findings, the proposed research will use functional and structural fMRI to examine the
cross-sectional profile of neural selectivity, reinstatement, and the anterior shift, and their relationships with
memory performance, in a large (N=160) lifespan sample of cognitively healthy adults (age range 18-90
years). The older cohort (aged 65-90 years) will be followed up after 3 years to assess whether selectivity,
reinstatement or shift metrics obtained at baseline are predictive of longitudinal change in cognitive
performance or brain structure. For the structural analyses we will focus on anterior medial temporal regions
that have been strongly implicated in pre-clinical and early Alzheimer’s Disease, with the aim of examining the
sensitivity of the functional metrics to incipient Alzheimer’s pathology. A second study will employ a lifespan
sample to assess whether the findings described above generalize to the auditory modality. A third study will
employ an extreme age group design to examine the role of retrieval demands (recall of general vs. specific
details from the study event) on age differences in the anterior shift."
10870179,"We discovered that a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the second extracellular loop of human G-protein-
coupled receptor 160 (hGPR160/ECL2) has two remarkable actions: (1) direct anti-cancer effects on human
colon cancer and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines that express the receptor without altering the
viability of a normal colon cancer cells line, and (2) great potentiation of the cytotoxic effects of the small molecule
chemotherapeutic, oxaliplatin, at doses that by themselves have no significant activity. This potentiation indicates
that combination with the hGPR160/ECL2 antibody might yield a considerable improvement in the clinical effect
with cytotoxin doses that are lower and produce fewer side-effects than those in current use. To translate these
observations into a practical therapy, we propose to develop a human monoclonal hGPR160/ECL2 antibody for
further characterization of its anticancer effects and as a step towards developing a therapeutically useful human
monoclonal hGPR160/ECL2 antibody. The current proposal is in response to PAR-22-216 with aims to develop
and test a new biologic agent that both treats cancer and mitigates cancer treatment-related toxicities. We are
unaware of any commercially available small molecule ligands for GPR160. Our recent publication1 and
preliminary data presented here indicate that an hGPR160/ECL2 monoclonal antibody is a viable
chemotherapeutic. However, our preliminary studies used a rabbit polyclonal antibody, which has an irreducible
element of uncertainty concerning the locus of binding. Accordingly, a human monoclonal hGPR160/ECL2
antibody will address this issue and permit unambiguous in vitro experiments on anticancer effects in human
cancer cell lines and in vivo experiments on human cell line-derived xenografts (CDX) in immunodeficient mice.
Success with the work proposed here in three Aims would lead to further work to develop a therapeutic
monoclonal antibody. In Aim 1, we will develop human monoclonal antibodies to hGPR160/ECL2 by immunizing
transgenic mice expressing human heavy and light genes with the hGPR160’s ECL2 amino acid sequence (or
subsequence thereof) conjugated to KLH and developing hybridomas via PEG-fusion. We will screen clonal
antibodies by flow cytometry and down-select using a blocking-of-binding assay to a panel of ~10
hGPR160/ECL2 mAbs clones for further in vitro and in vivo studies. We will then test the anti-cancer cell activity
of our antibodies with in vitro studies. In Aim 2, the top 2-3 candidates (best binding affinity against the ligand
and LC50 in the in vitro cell viability assay) will be advanced for (1) in vivo orthotopic cell line-derived xenograft
(CDX) mouse models of colon cancer and TNBC. In Aim 3, the top candidate will be tested in in vitro oxaliplatin
and paclitaxel potentiation studies. An hGPR160/ECL2 mAb may prove to be a significant improvement to
current anti-cancer treatments that are inadequate for a large percentage of patients. However, small molecule
cytotoxins will continue to have an important role and combination therapy with an hGPR160/ECL2 antibody
may allow their cytotoxic effects to be maximized while using doses with far fewer side effects."

 Currently, there are few options for treating diffuse cancers. This is a particular challenge
for diffuse cancers that arise in sensitive tissues (i.e., not amenable to resection), in tissues in
which drug diffusion is limited, or in patients for whom typical interventions incur unacceptable
sequelae (e.g., pediatric patients).
 Here, we investigate a novel approach: guiding cells with electrical fields (electrotaxis) to
consolidate the diffuse cancer cells to one or few locations (making them less diffuse), or
alternately, move these cells to a less critical location. As a basis for our approach, we will use
one of the most aggressive forms of pediatric brain tumor, Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma
(DIPG), which is emblematic of the challenges inherent in treating diffuse cancers. The need for
new treatments for DIPG is particularly critical, as it arises in the pons–a site that hosts critical
centers for breathing, chewing, heartbeat and swallowing–and incurs a dismal median survival
time of 9 months and is fatal in more than 99% of patients.
 We propose to quantify, using transcriptomics and pharmacological inhibition, underlying
mechanisms of electrotactic tumor cell response. This will reveal electrotactic drug targets and
provide controls to manipulate/enhance further electrotaxis. We will investigate in vivo, the
effects of various electrode montages to shape and steer infiltrative DIPG cells in both the
cortex and pons. To support our approach, we will apply computational methods to iteratively
model and design stimulation montages in response to observed patterns of growth after field
application. These studies will provide a novel approach to addressing the general problem of a
diffuse cancer so that they can become more amenable to standard-of-care therapies."

national presentations and high impact publications. The specific aim of this application is a successful
competitive renewal for the existing Utah Clinical Center as a member of the MFMU Network. The Utah Center
is consistently among the leading Network centers for screening, recruitment and data quality. Torri Metz MD
has served as the Utah center PI since early 2019. She has worked to ensure that the University of Utah –
Intermountain Healthcare (IHC) collaboration continues to be mutually beneficial, and given her long-standing
collaboration with the University of Colorado, was able to add them as a satellite site of the Utah Center in
early 2022. The 6 participating hospitals represent over ~20,000 deliveries per year in the Intermountain West
with a catchment area that includes Utah, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Wyoming, Arizona, and
Montana. Importantly, Utah provides geographic diversity with potential participants from rural and frontier
locations who are at increased risk of maternal morbidity and mortality. Utah investigators have established
partnerships with leaders in our Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander and Native American communities to help
increase enrollment in clinical studies and further diversify our participants. We have a collaborative
relationship with the Utah Neonatal Research Network, which has contributed to our success in long-term
follow-up studies. Overall, 21 perinatal research personnel at UUHSC and IHC, and an additional 4 research
staff in Colorado, are specifically dedicated to MFMU studies. Coverage is available 24/7. Our staff are
dedicated clinical researchers, with a low turnover rate. The Utah center contributes to the science of the
MFMU and has submitted 28 proposals to the Network Steering Committee, of which 16 have been advanced
to full protocol status. Dr. Torri Metz (Utah Center PI) is the PI for two active MFMU protocols (GRAVID and
PASC-PREG), has numerous Network committee responsibilities, and has developed collaborations between
the MFMU Network and other NIH-funded clinical research networks. The addition of Dr. Kevin Watt (co-I)
brings expertise in obstetric pharmacology and pharmacokinetics in pregnant and lactating people.
The University of Utah is enthusiastically committed to continued participation in the NICHD MFMU Network,
as confirmed by multiple letters of support. The proven and continuing ability of Drs. Metz and Esplin to enlist
wide-spread participation by community obstetric providers and to attract/retain an excellent clinical research

 Acinetobacter baumannii is an important nosocomial pathogen that causes a range of diseases, including
respiratory and urinary tract infections, meningitis, endocarditis, wound infections, and bacteremia. In fact, A.
baumannii is now responsible for up to 20% of all intensive care unit infections in some regions of the world with
pneumonia being the most common presentation. The clinical significance of A. baumannii has been propelled
by this organism’s rapid acquisition of resistance to virtually all antibiotics. The identification of novel targets for
therapeutic intervention is critical to our ability to protect the public health from this emerging infectious threat.
A promising area of therapeutic development exploits the idea that all bacterial pathogens require nutrient metal
to cause infection. This approach mimics host-mediated metal sequestration, which is a potent defense against
infection in a process termed “nutritional immunity”. Paradoxically, dietary restriction of metal exacerbates
infection underscoring how alterations in metal abundance can profoundly impact the outcome of host-pathogen
interactions. The host protein calprotectin (CP) is one of the most important contributors to immune-mediated
metal restriction and CP protects against infection through the chelation of nutrient metals, including zinc (Zn).
 Using CP as a probe, we have uncovered a genetic locus within A. baumannii that is important for survival
during conditions of CP-dependent Zn starvation. This locus encodes a member of the conserved COG0523
family of GTPases that we have named Zur-induced GTPase A (ZigA). We have also found a second COG0523
member within the A. baumannii genome that we refer to as 0934. ZigA and 0934 have biological properties
consistent with metallochaperones that insert Zn into client proteins. Our preliminary data indicate that 0934 and
ZigA bind and regulate client metalloenzymes involved in cell wall synthesis and recycling. Based on these
fundamental discoveries, we hypothesize that A. baumannii colonization of the lung leads to massive
accumulation of CP which starves A. baumannii for nutrient Zn. We further hypothesize that ZigA and 0934
regulate cell wall remodeling during Zn starvation to accommodate insertion of nutrient Zn transporters into the
cell envelope that are necessary to combat host- or dietary-imposed Zn starvation.
 To test this central model, we propose a series of experiments aimed at understanding the mechanism and
pathophysiological consequence of the A. baumannii response to dietary and host-imposed Zn deprivation
during pneumonia. In these studies, we will (i) define the molecular interactions of ZigA and 0934 with their
metalloprotein clients, (ii) interrogate the physiological function of ZigA and 0934 in A. baumannii, and (iii)
determine the importance of ZigA and 0934 in response to Zn starvation during the pathogenesis of pneumonia.
This research will establish a new paradigm for how bacteria respond to dietary- or immune-mediated Zn
restriction during infection through metallochaperone-dependent regulation of cell wall homeostasis."

A cornerstone of Type 2 diabetes (DMII) care is the control of co-morbid cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk
factors, including hypertension (HTN), to reduce morbidity and mortality. Yet only half of adults with diabetes
achieve recommended blood pressure targets. These disparities are more pronounced in immigrant and
minoritized groups that experience a disproportionate burden of CVD. South Asians (persons with ancestry from
India, Bangladesh, Pakistan or other parts of the South Asian continent) represent one of the fastest -growing
immigrant populations in the US and many of them experience high rates of poverty, limited English proficiency
(LEP) and barriers to accessing healthcare that may contributeto their disproportionateburdenof DMII and HTN.
Our work in NYC and Atlanta has demonstrated the efficacy and feasibility of linguistically and culturally tailored
community health worker (CHW)-led telehealth programs to improve diabetes and co-morbid HTN management
among South Asians with DMII. Our model offers opportunities to specifically inform diffusion of a telehealth
intervention to the South Asian immigrant community, which has experienced growth in both large urban areas
that may contain a wealth of culturally tailored resources, as well as in mid-sized/small cities and suburban areas
where ethnic-specific resources may be sparse, creating the ideal context to evaluate the delivery of telehealth
education centralized in urban hubs. The proposedproject will build on a well-established collaboration between
researchers at the NYU School of Medicine, Emory School of Medicine, community-based primary care
practices, and community partners across the northeastern and southeastern US to promote comorbid DMII and
HTN management among South Asians. The overall goal of our type 1 hybrid trial is to test the effectiveness
and implementation process of a culturally and contextually tailored telehealth -based CHW-led coaching
intervention for HTN control among 450 South Asian patients with co-morbid DMII and HTN. The Specific Aims
are to: 1. Using a randomized controlled trial design, test the effectiveness of a CHW-led telehealth intervention
compared to usual care among individuals with DMII and uncontrolled HTN. The primary outcome is blood
pressure control, defined as <130/80 mmHg. We hypothesize that 20% more patients in the intervention arm
(relative to control) will achieve blood pressure control at 6 months. Secondary outcomes will include reduction
in HbA1c and weight at 6 and 12 months, BP control at 12 months, enhanced use of community services, and
increased self-efficacy; and 2. Using RE-AIM and CFIR frameworks, examine the reach, adoption, fidelity, and
maintenance of the intervention within clinical and community settings, and delineate contextual factors
influencing implementation outcomes. This study addresses the urgent need to test telehealth and CHW-led
interventions to address CVD disparities in immigrant communities living outside of urban hubs. Our model offers
a paradigm shift by addressing co-morbid HTN and DMII, and will foster dissemination of evidence-based
interventions in settings that engage vulnerable populations with a high burden of chronic disease."

People who inject drugs (PWID) remain a high priority population under the Ending the HIV Epidemic: Plan for
America (EHE) with 11% of new HIV infections attributable to injection drug use (IDU). IDU has led to multiple
recent outbreaks of HIV in the US, driven primarily by the ongoing opioid and stimulant crises, creating an
obstacle in meeting EHE goals of a 90% reduction in incident HIV infections by 2030 through the 4 pillars –
diagnose, treat, prevent, and respond. EHE has identified evidence-based interventions within these pillars,
including rapid HIV testing, antiretrovirals, comprehensive syringe services programs (SSPs), and PrEP that
need to be implemented, scaled, and sustained within communities most affected by HIV. To maximize and
extend the effectiveness of these interventions among PWID, differentiated, simplified, integrated, and
comprehensive healthcare models need to be developed, tested, and deployed where they are in comfortable,
destigmatizing environments that simultaneously address a key driver of HIV—substance use disorder (SUD).
In addition to HIV, PWID continue to be impacted by a myriad of harmful health conditions such as hepatitis C
virus (HCV), overdose, bacterial infections and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) due to structural, economic,
social, and policy constraints. PWID often experience discrimination, stigma, and considerable social
disadvantage, leading to almost universal poorer health outcomes than comparable populations who do not
inject drugs. The need for innovative, efficacious, scalable, and community-driven models of healthcare in
destigmatizing settings for PWID is crucial. Our team has led the development and testing of Tele-Harm
Reduction (THR): a telehealth-based, multicomponent, adaptive care model for PWID living with HIV. Building
on this work, we now seek to rapidly adapt and test Comprehensive-THR (C-THR) for comprehensive HIV
prevention services delivered via an SSP. We propose a hybrid type I effectiveness-implementation randomized
controlled trial (n=350) to evaluate the efficacy of the C-THR model vs. offsite referral and peer navigation for
engagement in HIV prevention (i.e., PrEP or medications for OUD). PWID will be recruited from an academic
medical center-based syringe services program (SSP) in Miami, FL (IDEA Miami) from both fixed and mobile
SSP modalities. There are three overall aims of the proposed study: (1) to determine if the C-THR model
increases engagement in HIV prevention compared to offsite referral and peer navigation, (2) to examine the
long-term clinical and cost-effectiveness of the C-THR model, and (3) to assess the implementation and
scalability of the C-THR model in diverse SSP settings. The co-primary outcome is tenofovir on dried blood spot
or buprenorphine on urine drug screen across follow-up at 3,6,9 and 12 months. Secondary outcomes will include
engagement in HIV/HCV/STI testing and sustained virologic response (SVR, cure) for HCV. The cost-
effectiveness analysis, long-term modeling, and mixed-methods implementation and scalability evaluation will
provide compelling data on the sustainability and possible impact of C-THR on comprehensive HIV prevention
delivered via SSPs in the COVID era and beyond."

Zaire Ebola virus (EBOV) infections remain an emerging threat in Central and West Africa with case fatality rates
reaching as high as 90%. An FDA-approved, live-attenuated, recombinant vaccine called ERVEBO has shown
promise during recent outbreaks in Guinea in 2016 and Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in 2019.
ERVEBO stimulates antibody responses directed against the EBOV glycoprotein (GP). “Ring vaccination” is the
current emergency immunization strategy that focuses on immunizing direct contacts and geographically
proximal populations surrounding the epicenter of an EBOV outbreak. However, emerging data in the DRC show
that ring vaccination can be highly porous; nearly 30% of EBOV-infected participants in a recent antiviral trial in
the DRC were prior recipients of the ERVEBO vaccine. The mechanistic bases for these vaccine failures are not
known.
 This multi-PI, interdisciplinary project explores the hypothesis that acute malaria impairs EBOV
immunization-induced B and T cell responses. In support of this hypothesis, EBOV outbreaks largely occur
where Plasmodium falciparum infections are endemic; malaria is common throughout Central and West Africa.
Moreover, our collaborative team has developed experimental Plasmodium infection and EBOV vaccination
systems to generate preliminary data showing that malaria dramatically impairs EBOV vaccine-induced, virus-
specific antibody responses. We have also identified potential strategies to overcome the malaria-associated
impairments in vaccine efficacy. In this project we synergistically apply tractable, high-resolution, antigen-specific
systems to determine the mechanisms by which Plasmodium infections impact EBOV vaccine-induced humoral
and cellular immunity. These new approaches facilitate our long-term goal to define the impact of Plasmodium
infection on the efficacy of EBOV vaccine-induced immune responses. Our goal is addressed by three specific
aims that test: 1) how Plasmodium infections impact vaccine-induced, virus specific B cell responses; 2) how
Plasmodium infections influence the function of helper T cell subsets required for promoting antibody responses;
and 3) how malaria affects EBOV vaccine-induced protection against virulent mouse adapted, BSL-4 EBOV
challenge. Successful completion of these studies will reveal the mechanisms by which Plasmodium infections
impair EBOV vaccine responses and provide clinically applicable approaches to overcome this impairment. Such
knowledge gained will inform vaccine strategies that must be rapidly and effectively implemented during EBOV
outbreaks."

Childhood obesity remains highly prevalent and originates early in life. Efficacious early life interventions to
prevent childhood obesity are lacking, particularly among populations most burdened by childhood obesity.
Food insecurity - defined as lack of enough food for an active, healthy life – may play key upstream roles in
etiologies of obesity through establishment of unhealthy dietary patterns and stress-related metabolic
perturbations. Household food insecurity during the first 24 months of life is a risk factor for later childhood
obesity. Professional organizations recommend integration of household food insecurity screening into routine
pediatric primary care. Yet, a critical gap exists in identification of efficacious clinical interventions to reduce
food insecurity. Another gap exists in understanding relationships between food insecurity and etiologies of
obesity. Food FARMacia is a clinically based mobile food pantry intervention developed to address the high
prevalence of food insecurity among pediatric patients. No randomized trials of a clinically-based mobile food
pantry intervention in pediatric primary care exist. To understand the role of food insecurity in etiologies of
childhood obesity, efficacious interventions to reduce food insecurity are needed. To test efficacy of the Food
FARMacia intervention in a randomized clinical trial (RCT), feasibility of RCT procedures must first be
established.
The overall goal of this study is to perform a Phase IIb pilot and feasibility RCT of the Food FARMacia clinically
based mobile food pantry intervention to promote healthy weight during infancy compared to an attention
control over 6 months. We will recruit 70 families (randomized n = 35 infant-parent dyads per arm) with an
infant age 6 to <18 months and food insecurity identified on routine electronic health record screening at
pediatric primary care visits in our multi-site urban academic health care system. We will examine feasibility
and acceptability of the RCT procedures and intervention components using quantitative and qualitative
research methods. We will estimate the effects of the intervention on infant weight characteristics over time to
inform a full-scale trial. We will explore potential mediators of intervention effects, including household food
insecurity. Our multidisciplinary team has expertise in childhood obesity, nutrition, community-engaged, and
population health research; clinical trials; qualitative research; and biostatistics. Results will immediately inform
a full-scale Phase III RCT to test the efficacy of the Food FARMacia intervention on preventing childhood
obesity. Results of a full-scale trial will also provide new information about relationships of household food
insecurity during infancy and etiologies of obesity. If successful, this research will accelerate identification of
scalable, efficacious clinical interventions to transform clinical care for reduction of food insecurity and
promotion of healthy infant growth."

Fusobacterium nucleatum, a Gram-negative anaerobe that plays a key role in the development of oral biofilms,
or dental plaque, has the remarkable ability to escape host immunity and spread to extraoral sites, including
placenta and colon, where it is associated with significant diseases such as preterm birth and colorectal cancer.
To date, we have a poor understanding of the mechanisms of virulence and disease by F. nucleatum, and the
environmental factors in the extraoral sites that potentially affect the virulence potential of this pathogen.
Considering that ethanolamine (EA) – an important source of carbon/nitrogen and energy, and a signaling
molecule for some bacterial pathogens – is abundant in placenta during fetal development, we aim to test the
central hypothesis that regulated EA metabolism via a specialized organelle, bacterial microcompartment (BMC),
modulates the virulence potential of F. nucleatum. This hypothesis is based on our compelling preliminary data
showing that environmental EA stimulates BMC formation and expression of EA utilization genes, and that
blockage in EA catabolism alters the pathogenicity of F. nucleatum. The major goal of this application is to
examine how BMC-mediated EA utilization affects fusobacterial virulence (Aim 1) and how blockage in EA
catabolism modulates fusobacterial pathogenicity (Aim 2). The results generated from our studies will not only
provide important knowledge regarding the pathophysiology of F. nucleatum and promising therapeutic targets,
but also have potential to advance the broad field of host-pathogen interactions."

 Poor understanding of the mechanisms that modulate virus pathogenesis limits our ability to control
viral infections and reduce their public health burden. Non-standard viral genomes of the copy-back type
(cbVGs) that are generated during viral infections are the primary inducers of antiviral immunity to respiratory
syncytial virus (RSV) in vitro, in mice, and in humans. Most importantly, we recently reported that cbVGs
generated during RSV replication significantly impact the clinical outcome of infection in children and adults.
These data suggest that cbVGs are key determinants of viral pathogenesis and that their activity can be
harnessed to minimize viral-associated disease.
 It's clear that the virus host-interaction is complex, and it is essential to untangle this complexity to
identify better predictors of disease severity as well as better therapeutic strategies. A better understanding of
the factors that influence the generation and activity of cbVGs is necessary for exploiting them as a tool for
reducing the public health burden of RSV and related viruses. In studies funded in the original proposal, we
demonstrated that the presence of cbVG critically impact RSV pathogenesis. While detection of cbVGs soon
after infection is protective from severe disease, late or sustained presence of cbVGs associates with more
severe disease. Studies proposed here, directly follow these data and focus on investigating viral and host
factors that impact cbVG generation and activity. To do this, we will characterize the cbVG species present in
human respiratory secretions and we will study their function and association with distinct clinical outcomes.
This study will provide the first comprehensive investigation of naturally occurring cbVG species and will
identify unique features that determine their protective or potentially pathogenic functions (Aim 1). We will also
assess the impact of known RSV risk factors on cbVG generation to identify host determinants of cbVG
accumulation, and we will perform proof of concept experiments to test if cbVGs can be safely used to
minimize virus-induced disease in high-risk settings (Aim 2). Lastly, we will test the role of the host immune
bias in driving disease in patients with late or prolonged cbVGs and will identify potential targets for treatment
to reduce disease in these conditions (Aim 3)."
10837105,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in
the United States and although the overall CRC mortality rate has been decreasing, disparities have persisted,
particularly for Black and Native American people. CRC screening is highly effective and there is a welcome
national attention on improving access to screening for groups that are socially disadvantaged. However, the
benefits of screening depend on receiving both high-quality testing and timely follow-up care when abnormal.
Thus, disparities may persist even when rates of participation in screening are similar across populations.
Recently, the US Preventive Services Task Force highlighted a gap in the understanding of CRC disparities and
the relative lack of interventions that have been shown to eliminate disparities by race and ethnicity. The goal
of this application is to inform feasible and effective strategies for advancing health equity by elucidating the
extent to which differences in care along the entire screening process cumulatively contribute to disparities. We
will comprehensively evaluate the entire screening continuum from the tests used and screening quality to
receipt of follow-up care and guideline-concordant treatment in a cohort of about 3.8 million people per year
over a nearly 2-decade period in Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) and Kaiser Permanente
Southern California (KPSC). We will use a mixed methods approach informed by health equity frameworks to
examine: 1) the receipt and quality of screening for CRC, including follow-up when abnormal; 2) post-screening
treatment and disease outcomes, including interval CRCs, 5-year survival, and age-standardized incidence and
mortality, overall and by location; 3) the reasons for variations in quality and timely follow-up using qualitative
interviews; and 4) the relative contributions of differences along the screening continuum to disparities in
mortality by using microsimulation modeling. We will conduct our studies in a dynamic cohort of 45-85-year-old
men and women in KPNC/KPSC during the 2003-2019 period. The members of KPNC and KPSC mirror the
characteristics, in terms of social factors, of people in the regions served across California. The complete
capture of all screening steps and diverse, well-defined populations enable studies of strategies across the
screening continuum among social groups. Our analyses will compare the racial and ethnic groups and
stratifications by race for each outcome over a nearly 2-decade period. We will interview patient-clinician dyads
to elucidate reasons for variations in quality, follow-up, and outcome. We will also use the MISCAN-Colon
microsimulation model to examine the extent to which disparities in mortality are attributable to differences found
across each step in the screening continuum. The proposed research has a high potential to inform the
prioritization of strategies for advancing health equity across disadvantaged racial and ethnic minority groups
and thus advance a national public health priority. The 1½ decades of high-impact collaboration in our team,
and the setting and rigor of our application support the feasibility and high potential for impact in the field."

How individual retinal cell types arise from retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) is an active field of research, as it is
critical to understanding the generation of cellular diversity in the retina and developing therapeutic strategies
to treat degenerative retinal diseases. Many transcription factors involved in the generation of individual retinal
cell types have been identified. Single-cell technologies have led to unprecedented progress in discerning the
cellular relationships of the different lineage trajectories and the underlying changes in the epigenetic landscape.
The roles of individual transcription factors in shaping the epigenetic landscape to drive multipotent RPCs to
specific fates are also beginning to be revealed. A major finding from the single-cell RNA-seq studies is that all
the retinal lineages undergo a shared state, namely transitional RPCs (tRPCs), before fate determination. tRPCs
are multipotent and co-express genes involved in the different retinal cell types such as Atoh7 for RGCs and Otx2
and Neurod1 for photoreceptors. Our mapping of binding sites for Atoh7 and Otx2 by CUT&Tag suggests a
general paradigm via which the co-expressed transcription factors compete at enhancers of lineage-specific genes
to drive tRPCs to different cell fates. The focus of our lab has been on the mechanisms controlling RGC genesis.
In this application, we propose to address several key knowledge gaps regarding the emergence
of the RGC lineage from tRPCs. The first is the missing branch of upstream input as indicated by our scRNA-
seq analysis of the Atoh7-null retina. We hypothesize that the SoxC factors fulfill this role by function in parallel
with Atoh7 to promote RGC genesis based on previous findings on the roles of the SoxC factors in RGC genesis.
The second gap we aim to address is the molecular basis for the specificity of Atoh7 for the RGC lineage. This is
based on the fact that several proneural bHLH transcription factors, including Atoh7 and Neurod1, which all
bind to the E box motif, are co-expressed in tRPCs, but only Atoh7 promotes RGC formation. Using ectopic
expression in retinal explants, we have obtained compelling evidence which suggests that the RGC-specificity of
Atoh7 resides in the bHLH domain. We will further explore the molecular basis for the RGC specificity of Atoh7
in vivo using knockin mouse lines. Lastly, we will investigate the regulatory mechanisms leading to the fixation
of the RGC fate. We will leverage the candidate enhancers identified from our scATAC-seq and CUT&Tag
experiments for the key RGC specific transcription factor gene Pou4f2 and examine their contributions to the
eventual expression of Pou4f2. Our experiments are designed to address these gaps using a combined approach
of mouse genetics, immunohistochemistry, genomics, transcriptomics, and single cell techniques. These
proposed experiments aim to understand key gene regulatory events controlling the emergence of the RGC
lineage from tRPCs. The findings will lead to further insights into the molecular basis underpinning the cellular
diversity in the retina and offer guidance for developing strategies to treat degenerative retinal diseases."
10805465,"Sjögren’s Syndrome (SS) is a chronic and debilitating systemic autoimmune disorder afflicting multiple
organ systems. The targeting of the exocrine salivary and lacrimal glands by an autoimmune and
inflammatory response leads to organ dysfunction causing reduced fluid secretion, which manifests
into the dry mouth and dry eye symptoms of the disorder. Although a wide age range is reported in
patients at diagnosis, it is well known that most SS patients are older. Why phenotypic traits are more
prominent in older patients is unknown. Aging organs show heightened oxidative stress, which is often
associated with declining organ function. Although,. SS patients show evidence of increased oxidative
stress markers; whether elevated oxidative stress is causative or the outcome of an inflammatory
response is unclear and challenging to investigate in patients. Hence based on published literature and
our preliminary data, this proposal will test the overall hypothesis that the combined effects of
autoimmunity and aging-associated oxidative stress contribute to salivary gland disease and
dysfunction in SS. Aim 1 of this proposal will specifically address the hypothesis that aging-associated
oxidative stress makes salivary glands more susceptible to immune-mediated damage. And in aim 2,
by using a novel mouse model system, we will test the hypothesis that oxidative stress per se in salivary
gland epithelial cells is insufficient to cause SS. The primary goal of this proposal is to understand the
mechanisms behind key clinical observations in SS patients: prominence of clinical symptoms at an
older age and the possible role of elevated oxidative stress in the disease process. Understanding
basic mechanisms linking aging with organ dysfunction in SS will be essential in developing novel
modalities to treat the disease."

The World Health Organization has set goals for cervical cancer (CC) elimination through global HPV vaccination
and cervical cancer screening (CCS). Unfortunately, neither real-world HPV vaccine effectiveness nor efficient
CCS have been established for women living with HIV (WWH) who are disproportionately affected by CC. Our
group reported that HPV-vaccinated young women living with perinatal HIV infection (WWPHIV) had very high
rates of abnormal cervical cytologic compared with HIV [-] women suggesting reduced vaccine effectiveness.
While primary HPV testing used for screening (PHS) with a triage test is the preferred method for CCS in the
general population in the U.S., the CDC has not recommended it for WWH because of the lack of scientific
support. A recent study by our group showed that PHS with triage 16/18 genotyping in WWH cut the number of
unnecessary colposcopies in half without reducing sensitivity (vs HPV/cytology co-testing); however, the positive
predictive value remained low. Furthermore, the recently FDA-approved dual immunocytochemistry staining for
p16/ki67 as well as novel biomarkers using extended HPV genotyping and DNA methylation show great promise
but are vastly understudied in WWH. We have an exceptional opportunity to examine both HPV vaccine
effectiveness and PHS screening triage strategies in WWH by partnering with the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort
Study (PHACS) led, in part, by our investigative team. PHACS includes a cohort of over 2400 WWH, including
WWPHIV and WWH, horizontally (WWHH) infected, who are enrolled along with their HIV exposed children. We
estimated that 90% of the WWPHIV and 50% of the WWHH <41 years of age have received at least one HPV
dose. Among WWH, we aim to: 1) examine the effectiveness of the HPV vaccine defined by the 3-year
cumulative risk of i) vaccine-HPV types that persist 12 months or longer and, ii) histologic (h) cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)-2+; 2a) examine and compare the sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive (PPV)
and negative predictive values (NPV) to detect hCIN-2+ immediately or in 3 years in PHS[+] women using 4
reflex strategies: (i) cytology, (ii) HPV extended genotyping, (iii) p16/Ki-67 dual staining cytology, and (iv)
HPV/host methylation levels; 2b) examine the Se, Sp, PPV, and NPV in self-collected PHS[+} samples for
hCIN2+ detection focusing on methylation and HPV genotyping triage tests since these 2 tests are suitable for
self-collected samples. We plan to screen ~810 WWH using a self-sampling kit--now a well-accepted mode for
screening-- for PHS testing (Roche Cobas) and those who PHS[+] (~570) will attend a clinical visit to have
colposcopy/biopsy and the 4 triage tests. WWH with <CIN 2+ are asked to return annually for colposcopy and
HPV genotyping for up to 3 yrs. WWH with CIN 2+ are exited. WWH PHS[-] will be asked to return in Year 2 for
rescreening. Those PHS[+] will be followed as above and PHS[-] will be asked to obtain self-collected vaginal
samples for HPV genotyping annually for 3 years. Impact. Understanding HPV vaccine effectiveness and
optimal CCS strategies in WHH will make a significant contribution to decreasing the worldwide burden of CC."
10935946,"Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is a common problem among Veterans and is associated with a greater
likelihood of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Our recently completed VA Merit study identified a diet
enriched in non-omega 3 polyunsaturated fat (PUFA) to be superior to monounsaturated fat for:
weight loss, reductions in triglycerides (TG), and blood pressure; as well as improvement in
endothelial function in Veterans with the metabolic syndrome. However, the differential effects of an
isocaloric meal that varies in fat composition has not been studied in HTG. Because postprandial
lipemia (PPL) represents a highly atherogenic state and HTG increases the magnitude of PPL;
differentiating between fat meals enriched in saturated fat (SFA), monounsaturated fat (MUFA) and
polyunsaturated fat (PUFA) on mediators of atherosclerosis is highly relevant to Veterans at
increased risk of CVD.
The Specific Aims are as follows:
Specific Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that a fat meal enriched with SFA (coconut oil) will
accentuate PPL compared to a fat meal enriched with MUFA (high oleic sunflower oil) or PUFA
(salmon oil). Specifically, we hypothesize that a MUFA or PUFA enriched meal will produce a
smaller PPL response and downregulate expression and levels of biomarkers of systemic
inflammation and thrombosis compared to an SFA-enriched meal in Veterans with HTG. The effects
are likely to be accentuated after a 4-week dietary phase enriched in saturated fat.
Specific Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that a fat meal enriched with SFA (coconut oil) will impair
endothelial function compared to MUFA (high oleic sunflower oil) or PUFA (salmon oil). Specifically,
we hypothesize that a MUFA or PUFA enriched meal will improve flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD,)
and circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) compared to a meal enriched with SFA in
Veterans with HTG.
Specific Aim 3: To study the lipid-based mechanisms modulating the response to a fat-enriched
meal. They include HDL function (cholesterol efflux, HDL oxidation index and paraoxonase activity),
lipolytic and transfer protein activity (LPL, HL, CETP), adhesion of monocytes to the endothelial
monolayer, miRNA profiles in endothelial cells and monocyte/macrophages, and effects on the gut
microbiome. We hypothesize that a fat meal enriched with SFA coconut oil will impair these
parameters to a greater extent than MUFA or PUFA enriched meals, and that this effect is likely to be
accentuated after a 4-week dietary phase enriched in saturated fat.
This VA Merit proposal capitalizes on collaboration among experienced investigators in lipoprotein
metabolism and nutritional biochemistry. Collectively, these studies are expected to advance our
understanding of the differential effects of a fat-enriched meal on: lipoprotein metabolism,
inflammation, molecular expression of cellular and vascular mediators of inflammation, HDL and
endothelial function and atherogenic gut metabolites in Veterans at accelerated CVD risk. The study
may also have important practical implications for Veterans with HTG who are confused by media
outlets who advocate for coconut oil-based products despite the lack of data supporting its widespread
use."
10894152,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Ovarian cancer remains the most lethal gynecologic malignancy and the fifth most frequent cause of cancer-
related mortality in women in the United States. Advanced-stage high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC)
is the most commonly diagnosed subtype and constitutes the majority of ovarian cancer deaths. Despite a high
response rate to initial platinum-taxane chemotherapy, patients with HGSOC frequently relapse and become
increasingly resistant to platinum analogues. PARP inhibitors have been recently approved to treat HGSOC;
however, the greatest clinical benefit from PARPi monotherapy has been mainly observed in tumors with
homologous recombination (HR) deficiency. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet medical need to develop
alternative therapeutic strategies for patients with HGSOC. Given that the transcriptional program is remarkably
dysregulated in cancer, resulting in cancer dependency on specific components of the transcriptional program
(termed “transcriptional addiction”), targeting transcriptional CDKs is emerging as a new strategy for cancer
treatment. Among the transcriptional CDKs, CDK7 shows the most significant copy number loss (dominantly
hemizygous) across multiple cancer types with the highest deletion score in HGSOC. Importantly, HGSOC cells
with hemizygous loss of CDK7 are highly sensitive to CDK7i treatment. Additionally, CDK7 loss is correlated with
increased sensitivities to DNA damaging drugs such as PARPi and platinum. Inhibition of CDK7 preferentially
represses the expression of genes in the DNA damage repair pathways and impairs the activity of HR. Therefore,
we hypothesize that hemizygous loss of CDK7 is a targetable vulnerability in HGSOC, and that CDK7i alone or
in combination with DNA damaging agents is a novel strategy to treat patients with HGSOC. Low-dose CDK7i
treatment can preferentially repress a group of HGSOC-associated genes that are driven by super enhancers,
serving as an effective and tolerable treatment for a select population of patients with HGSOC. The central goal
of this application is to study the mechanistic basis and translational potential of CDK7-targeted therapy in
HGSOC. We have assembled a team of collaborators with added expertise and resources to test the above
hypothesis through three specific aims. Specific Aim 1. Evaluate whether hemizygous loss of CDK7 is a
targetable vulnerability in HGSOC. Specific Aim 2. Characterize the molecular mechanisms of low-dose CDK7i
treatment in DNA damage response. Specific Aim 3. Evaluate CDK7i in combination with FDA-approved
therapies in preclinical models of HGSOC. Our proposed studies may provide strong rationale for clinical
development of CDK7 inhibitors for ovarian cancer treatment."
10894884,"Project Abstract
Tumors frequently re-activate genes whose expression is otherwise restricted to gametogenic tissues including
the ovary, placenta and testes. Tumorigenic expression of these genes, known collectively as cancer-testes
antigens (CTAs), has been documented for over 25 years, however functional knowledge of the contribution of
these gene products to tumorigenesis remains scant. We have recently discovered that expression of one of
these CTAs, Cytochrome C Oxidase subunit 6B2 (COX6B2), is activated in lung adenocarcinoma. COX6B2 is
essential for tumor survival in vitro and in vivo and its expression correlates with shortened patient survival
time. We have found that expression of COX6B2 in cancer cells leads to an increase in activity of Complex IV
(cytochrome c-oxidase) and ATP production. Based on these findings, we assert that tumor cells adopt
metabolic mechanisms from one of the most ATP-intensive processes in the animal kingdom: sperm motility.
To test this hypothesis, we propose to dissect the tumor-specific function of COX6B2 at multiple biological
length scales incorporating structural, cell biological and whole animal approaches. Our specific aims are to 1)
dissect the molecular mechanism by which COX6B2 enhances Cytochrome C oxidase activity, 2) determine
how COX6B2 is activated and its consequences on survival 3) elaborate the contribution of COX6B2 to
tumorigenesis and tumor survival in vivo. In Aim 1, we use a structure-guided approach to elucidate the
mechanism by which COX6B2 modulates Cytochrome c oxidase activity. In Aim 2, we will investigate how the
low oxygen tumor microenvironment activates COX6B2 and how COX6B2 promotes survival in hypoxia both
in cancer and in sperm. In Aim 3, we will use an orthotopic xenograft to determine how COX6B2 expression
influences tumorigenesis, tumor growth, and oxidative phosphorylation in vivo. The significance of the
proposed work lies in the identification of novel mechanisms that tumor cells adopt to promote oxidative
phosphorylation. Current electron transport chain inhibitors are hampered by a lack of therapeutic index due
to the broad necessity of this process in healthy tissues. This study proposes an innovative new solution to this
lack of specificity by presenting a target that is selectively expressed in cancer cells. The outcome of this work
will be a novel therapeutic entry point for targeting oxidative phosphorylation exclusively in tumor tissues."

Many emerging technologies are becoming increasing ubiquitous in workplaces as well as non-occupational
settings such as commercial and residential environments. While there are obvious benefits to these
technologies, unintended exposures and risks from their use are becoming increasingly apparent. Fostering
the safe and sustainable development and use of these technologies requires a critical mass of professionals
and researchers with the interdisciplinary education, training, and adaptability to tackle these occupational
health and safety (OHS) issues. Johns Hopkins University, the University of Maryland, George Mason
University, and Old Dominion University propose to work collaboratively on the Program on Occupational
health and safety education on Emerging Technologies – Mid Atlantic Partnership (POccETMAP) to
develop a comprehensive set of web-based educational and training modules, courses, and programs to foster
the safe development and use of emerging technologies and mitigate their risks, emerging contaminants, and
disaster preparedness. To accomplish this objective, we will develop five online cores for professional training
of OHS specialists, engineers, scientists, technicians, and instructors in the areas of (a) Detection
Technologies for emerging contaminants; (b) Exposure assessment strategies; (c) Disaster preparedness and
risk management; (d) Vulnerable occupational populations, and (e) Sustainable production and product
stewardship of emerging technologies. In the cores, we will demonstrate concepts with examples and
illustrations drawn from the following emerging technologies: additive manufacturing such as 3-D printing,
novel technologies for disinfection, electronic nicotine delivery systems, and nanobiotechnology. Each core will
contain 10 innovative, web-based modules that include short narrated screencasts, animations, exercises, and
activities. Instructors will use the modules to create lessons, courses, and programs in academic and
continuing education settings. All materials will be freely available on the web, ensuring that the POccETMAP

Shigella causes a high burden of dysentery globally. Children younger than 5 years of age, particularly toddlers
2-3 years old, living in impoverished areas lacking clean water and sanitation are the most affected. Repeated
infection results in lifelong health impairment and disability. Shigella also causes outbreaks in industrialized
countries (daycare centers and medical institutions) and is a serious threat due to its multi-drug resistance.
There is no approved vaccine. Most of the existing candidates rely on immunity to the Shigella O-antigen, which
is serotype-specific (there are 4 species and >50 diarrheagenic Shigella serotypes). Shigella O-polysaccharide
(OPS) conjugates (e.g., SF2a-TT15 and Flexyn2a) are the most clinically advanced. These vaccines are limited
in their use of irrelevant (non-Shigella) proteins as carriers. SF2a-TT15 uses tetanus toxoid, which is included in
many vaccines given to children of the target age and is known to suppress responses to other vaccine
components. Flexyn2a uses rEPA as carrier but had modest efficacy in a recent challenge study (did not meet
study endpoints). An earlier S. sonnei OPS-rEPA was effective in older children but not in toddlers (target age).
In response to RFA-AI-22-037, the University of Maryland (UMB), in partnership with Vaxcyte, proposes to
develop a bivalent (Shigella flexneri 2a and Shigella sonnei) OPS conjugate vaccine using Shigella IpaB, a Type
III secretion protein that is highly conserved among all Shigella spp., as carrier. IpaB is exceptionally
immunogenic and is a known broadly protective antigen; serum IgG (IgG1) levels and IpaB antibody function
were found to be positively associated with reduced disease in controlled human challenge studies.
For the first time, we have produced soluble, immunoreactive IpaB at a high (industrial) yield using Vaxcyte’s
cell-free protein expression system. IpaB is conjugated to S. flex 2a and S. sonnei OPS using Vaxcyte’s site-
specific conjugation technology. S. flex 2a OPS-IpaB given to mice intramuscularly with Alum on two occasions
28 days apart, elicited robust immune responses and afforded 78% protection against S. flex 2a (homologous)
and 56% against S. sonnei (heterologous) lethal pulmonary Shigella challenge. Vaccine efficacy against S. flex
2a was higher as compared with S. flex 2a OPS-conjugated to CRM197 (a diphtheria toxoid mutant).
This proposal consists of three aims to optimize process development, formulation, and scale-up production of
S. flex 2a- and S. sonnei OPS-IpaB conjugates (Aim 1), evaluate the immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy in two
animal models: mice (pulmonary challenge) and guinea pigs (rectocolitis infection) (Aim 2), and identify immune
operatives associated with protective immunity through passive transfer experiments and a suite of in vitro
functional assays (Aim 3). A bivalent Shigella-OPS-IpaB vaccine is expected to be well tolerated and to have
enhanced protective capacity than existing vaccines.
UMB and Vaxcyte have unique complementary expertise. Successful completion of this project will prepare the
vaccine to enter cGMP manufacturing and initiate human studies."

The Ohio State University (OSU) Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) was formed in 2007,
with the vision to advance today’s discoveries to improve health for all. We employed a comprehensive
approach to address the full spectrum of T1-T4 science via the education and career development of a highly
trained workforce integrated with a robust system of CTR resources. We provided leadership in the CTSA
Consortium through sharing of tools and methods to advance CTR; adopted innovations from other hubs; and
fully engaged in CTSA Consortium activities (e.g., multisite trials). We also supported community engaged
research addressing the most pressing health issues in our communities (e.g., opioid crisis, COVID-19). Yet,
work remains. Thus, we build upon unique strengths at OSU/NCH and in Ohio’s communities. We have
leveraged our strategic investment in data sciences, a robust environment of resources, and a vibrant CTR
community to address CTS gaps and barriers. We will now address five CTS roadblocks to improve the
quality, efficiency, and rigor of CTR: (1) need for improved efficiencies and effectiveness to advance CTR and
ensure results are disseminated and implemented into healthcare; 2) education and training innovations do not
reach the full CTR workforce, resulting in a declining and inadequately diverse CTS workforce, lacking the
knowledge and skills to advance CTR; 3) limited authentic participation by diverse stakeholders across the
research life cycle; 4) growth of complex datasets necessitates integration of clinical, environmental, and
research data, with need for democratization of data accessibility to advance data equity; and 5) racial injustice,
SDoH, the CTR teams we form, and interpretation of our results impact health disparities. Applying a health
equity and DEIA framework to every activity, we will pursue five aims: Aim 1: Develop innovations in
methods, approaches, and tools to address pressing roadblocks facing CTR. Aim 2: Support training and
career development of the full CTS workforce. Aim 3: Engage voices from across academic and scientific
disciplines, patients, communities, and industry to conduct CTR and CTS across the full lifecycle of the scientific
process. Aim 4: Deploy an accessible, responsive, and integrated system of research resources. Aim 5:
Democratize informatics resources by lowering the cost of entry for data access and computing resources. With
a commitment to metric-driven decision-making, we will evaluate the impact of the CCTS by applying the RE-
AIM framework to inform strategic pivots over the next 7 years. This proposal reaffirms our commitment to
advance CTS and expands our engagement with stakeholders to increase rigorous, impactful, and relevant
CTR. We will develop, share, and adopt innovations through focused CTS to enhance CTR for the communities
we serve and those we engage. These resources, skilled workforce, and institutional strengths provide an agile
foundation to facilitate rapid responses to emerging public health issues, and will ensure an equity lens is
applied to all CTR so no one is left behind from the advances of CTR to improve human health."

Every year, nearly 5 million people die from injuries and hundreds of millions more sustain non-fatal injuries that
require medical attention with low and middle income countries (LMICs), accounting for 90% of all injury related
deaths. Reducing the burden of injury requires a quality trauma care system incorporating surveillance,
prehospital and hospital based care and rehabilitation services; these systems are poor with limited services in
LMICs like Tanzania. This training program will train implementation science focused trauma and injury care
researchers to identify the gaps, barriers and facilitators to quality care, and adapt evidence based interventions
to Tanzania setting. The project builds on Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center and Duke University’s long
standing collaborations for capacity building (MEPI/HEPI, D43s) and injury research (R21 and R01) level
projects. The goals of this proposal are to train 2 doctoral and 10 masters students in innovative implementation
science and injury research and establish a network of injury focused stakeholders to support multi-disciplinary
research in the region."

The Clinical Scholars Biomedical Research Training Program (CSTP) at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer
Center (MSK) provides a mentored laboratory training experience in cancer research for outstanding MD and
MD/PhD residents/fellows who are emerging clinician-scientists. The CSTP is unique among training programs
at MSK since it prepares clinically active investigators, from a range of research disciplines, to pursue research
across the translational research spectrum. The goal of the program is to prepare highly qualified physician-
scientists for an independent research career at the interface of cancer biology and clinical research. The
Clinical Scholars in CSTP are trained by principal investigators with an exceptionally broad range of scientific
interests spanning most areas of modern cancer research. Out of 42 preceptors, 27 (67%) are physician-
scientists who excel at laboratory research, clinical research, and academic clinical practice and represent
strong role models for young investigators pursusing careers in oncology research. The CSTP consists of a
structured and cohesive two-year curriculum that combines laboratory research, didactic course work in cancer
biology, bioinformatics and computational training, and career development workshops. Trainees have access
to all resources of MSK, an instituion where basic, translational, and clinical research activites take place in
close proximity in a highly collaborative research environment. The research areas of principal emphasis
include: 1) human cancer biology, mouse models of cancer, genetics, epigenetics and molecular pathology; 2)
drug development and mechanism-based therapeutics; 3) signaling pathways involved in control of cell
proliferation; 4) regulatory pathways involved in developmental biology and cell differentiation; 5) cell-cell
interactions, adhesion and protein targeting; 6) tumor immunology, immunotherapy and transplantation biology.
The CSTP has had a long and successful training history with nearly all of its graduates continuing in highly
productive biomedical research careers. Thus, the CSTP has had signficant impact in meeting the national
need for physician-scientists who can play leading roles in translating basic discoveries in cancer biology into
clinical practice."
10928732,"Air pollution is a leading contributor to the global disease burden, which is a crucial concern
as the air quality across sub-Saharan Africa significantly and rapidly deteriorates with
accelerated urbanization, industrialization, and population growth. The synergistic association
between heat waves and air pollution is expected to exacerbate with the changing climate,
which poses a crucial threat to the health of vulnerable populations in low-income settings.
Studies which indicate associations between maternal and prenatal exposure to
environmental pollution and adverse health outcomes, highlight the need for further
investigation in African populations, as such vulnerable subpopulations are not consistently
investigated. Pregnant women who are exposed to heat stress coupled with air pollution are
more susceptible to adverse birth outcomes including; miscarriages, stillbirth, preterm birth,
low birth weight, and preeclampsia. Developing appropriate health sector responses and
adaptive interventions relies on identifying these vulnerable populations along with their level
of environmental risk. Socio-economic factors such as poverty, food and water insecurity, and
limited access to healthcare facilities perpetuate vulnerability among these communities.
Impacts of pollution exposure over periods of increased temperatures are difficult to measure
and require refined data science and analytical approaches. The current poor networks of
ground sensors for measuring air quality, piecemeal approaches to quantifying associations
with adverse health outcomes and dearth of translation from evidence to intervention warrants
a paradigm shift in approach. To address the lack of understanding of the environmental risk
impacts on the changing epidemiology in sub-Saharan Africa, the proposed research project
will aim to quantify the current and future impacts of air pollution on maternal and neonatal
health through innovative data science approaches such as machine learning, by accelerating
low-cost characterization of pollution exposure data while understanding its associations with
adverse outcomes related to pregnancy, childbirth and early life. Further to this we will develop
adaptive interventions that will help pregnant women and their children counter the risk
imposed by exposure to pollutants and build resilience against the high odds of adverse health
outcomes. The CHEAQI-MNCH project will provide an opportunity for emerging data scientists
and researchers in Africa to engage, collaborate and develop transferrable skills, while
contributing to a continental resource center for knowledge translation and dissemination
within the fields of climate and health."
10892687,"Project Summary
Technological breakthroughs such as next-generation sequencing have recently led to the creation of immense
“BioBanks” featuring genomic information collected from hundreds of thousands of people, and the ongoing
pandemic has resulted in an even more extreme repository containing over 10 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes.
Unfortunately, existing techniques for inferring evolutionary models can, in most cases, only analyze a tiny
fraction of the information contained in these datasets. At a time when we should be able to use vast quantities
of data to answer increasingly nuanced evolutionary questions, lack of adequate methods has limited our
opportunities for discovery and hampered our ability to respond to the ongoing pandemic.
The proposed research addresses this problem through the creation of novel statistical and computational
methods designed to study targeted evolutionary hypotheses using BioBank- and pandemic-scale datasets.
First, we will develop new phylodynamic methods for epidemiological inference using tens of thousands of
sampled pathogen genomes. Apart from being more scalable, these methods will innovate over previous work
by being more biologically realistic and making fewer simplifying assumptions about the data. In particular, we
will study systems where multiple strains co-circulate and have differential fitness, and we will use this model to
improve our understanding of the role that natural selection has played in shaping the pandemic. We will further
extend this method to integrate non-genetic sources of information such as case count data, which will enable
public health researchers to partition case counts into different variants and estimate variant-specific effective
reproduction numbers. Second, we will develop improved methods for inferring phylogenetic networks, and use
them to understand the role that recombination has played in the evolution of the coronavirus, as well as its role
in confounding earlier studies that incorrectly assumed that SARS-CoV-2 evolution could be represented by a
single tree. All of these advances will be implemented and released as easy to use open source software
packages.
In summary, this work represents advances in several areas of statistical genetics including phylodynamic
modeling, genetic epidemiology, inference of natural selection and phylogenetic network analysis, and will
provide empirical researchers with modern tools needed to propel the next generation of discoveries in these
fields."

TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT AND METASTASIS PROGRAM - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Tumor Microenvironment and Metastasis (TMM) Program is focused on investigating the genetic,
epigenetic, biochemical, microenvironmental, and developmental pathways that drive dissemination, dormancy,
and recurrence. These studies will identify novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers to address each of these
stages of metastatic progression. The overall goal of TMM is to catalyze basic research on the mechanisms by
which cancer cell intrinsic and microenvironmental signals conspire to fuel cancer cell systemic dissemination,
persistence during dormancy, and metastatic outgrowth in target organs. The overarching hypothesis is that
detailed mechanistic studies of both the tumor cell and the microenvironment during dissemination from primary
sites, re-dissemination from metastatic foci, dormancy and stem programs in collaboration with the Stem Cell
and Cancer Biology Program, and metastatic recurrence will lead to the identification and characterization of
novel therapeutic targets in collaboration with Cancer Therapeutics Program and biomarkers that may be useful
for personalizing the treatment of metastatic disease. Importantly, understanding target organ biology and how
it relates to individual’s predispositions to disease, lifestyle, and aging (in collaboration with Cancer Epidemiology
Prevention and Control Program) will provide insights into management of metastatic cancer. TMM investigators
utilize the power of basic science and an array of model systems (e.g., zebrafish, mice, organoids), imaging
modalities (e.g., intravital imaging, multiplex immunofluorescence), and human studies (e.g., tissue analyses,
epidemiological data) to characterize key aspects of how cancer cells, together with the immune and non-
immune microenvironment, control mechanisms of: (i) early and late dissemination, (ii) re-dissemination from
metastatic foci, (iii) extravasation and residual disease dormancy, and (iv) metastatic cell sensitivity/resistance
to systemic therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, targeted agents, immunotherapy) and effect of therapies on the TME.
Each of these approaches is explored in multiple cancers relevant to the catchment area, (prostate, breast,
HNSCC, melanoma, multiple myeloma). These objectives will be achieved through two specific aims, both
fostering intra- and inter-programmatic activities as well as community programs to accelerate TMM’s
translational, clinical, and educational output to ultimately impact cancer patients represented within our
catchment area. TMM’s specific aims are to: (1) Identify tumor microenvironments and signaling networks that
fuel dissemination and (2) Discover the target organ-driven mechanisms for cancer cell survival and dormancy
and how niche alterations drive metastasis.

CANCER THERAPEUTICS PROGRAM - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Significant advances have been made in the development of novel agents and combination regimens for the
treatment of human cancers. Despite this progress, major research efforts are still needed to develop new drugs
to improve anticancer therapy and overcome resistance to current therapies. To achieve this goal, a close
interaction between basic scientists, translational scientists, and clinical investigators is essential to translate
novel preclinical laboratory observations into the clinical setting for the treatment of human cancers. The
research objectives of our MECC Cancer Therapeutics (CT) Program have been greatly facilitated by organizing
inter- and trans-disciplinary teams of chemists, cancer biologists, cancer pharmacologists, biostatisticians and
bioinformatics experts, computational biologists, and clinical investigators.
 The Cancer Therapeutics Program is a long-standing interdisciplinary research program. The three new
Program Co-Leaders are leaders in the field of cancer therapeutics with scientific expertise that spans the entire
spectrum of preclinical and clinical cancer drug development. A high priority is placed on the recruitment and
mentoring of members who are deeply committed to the goals set forth by the Program and who focus on
developing intra-programmatic interactions as well as strong inter-programmatic interactions/collaborations with
other MECC research programs. Significant emphasis is placed on the preclinical and clinical development of
novel anticancer agents and new combination regimens for the treatment of human cancers.
 The overarching mission of the Program is to develop innovative approaches to discover, design, and develop
novel anticancer agents and/or therapeutic regimens for the treatment of human cancers. To achieve this
mission, the Program focuses on the following Specific Aims:
1) preclinical discovery and development of small molecules
2) preclinical discovery and development of biologics
3) conduct clinical trials that span early Phase I/II to late Phase III with a focus on translation of MECC
 discoveries/science into investigator-initiated clinical trials, and the clinical development of novel agents in
 partnership with NCI-CTEP, NCI cancer centers, NCI cooperative groups, and pharmaceutical companies
 Notably, these specific aims align with all four of MECC’s cross-cutting themes: 1) Catchment Area Disparities
and Equity; 2) Tumor and Organ Microenvironments; 3) Prevention, Early Detection and Interception of Primary
and Secondary Disease; and 4) Molecular Variations as Determinants of Outcome.

CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY, PREVENTION AND CONTROL PROGRAM – PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Cancer Epidemiology, Prevention and Control (CEPC) Program plays a central role in the scientific, clinical,
and public health mission of MECC. The Program’s overarching goal is to better understand and address drivers
of cancer burden and cancer disparities in our Bronx catchment area and other vulnerable populations. Program
investigators focus on studies in human populations to determine the behavioral, environmental, and molecular
risk factors that underlie cancer etiology and outcomes, leading to studies that devise, implement and test the
effectiveness of novel interventions to promote cancer prevention, screening, treatment and supportive care.
Program members collaborate extensively with one another and with the other three MECC research programs.
Given the inter- and trans-disciplinary nature of this program, CEPC is the focal point for translating laboratory-
based research into population level studies and for bridging findings from clinical and community settings back
to the lab. CEPC has three specific aims: (1) to characterize the risk factors that drive cancer health disparities
in our catchment area, most notably breast, lung, prostate, and cervical cancer; (2) to improve cancer prevention
and screening among vulnerable and high-risk groups in our catchment area and beyond; and (3) to develop
and implement innovative strategies to enhance cancer care outcomes. CEPC research has contributed to
improved health of the largely poor and minoritized Bronx population, as well as populations worldwide.
Completed and ongoing research in CEPC has substantively influenced clinical guidelines and public health
practice, with new studies poised to continue this trend. CEPC research: (i) has identified novel susceptibility
markers for breast cancer, prostate cancer, CRC, and lung cancer in non-smokers -- the major causes of cancer
mortality in the Bronx – demonstrating efforts to understand the mechanisms of cancer in an environmental and
behavioral context; (ii) contributed to major policy decisions regarding cancer care of firefighters who worked at
the 9/11 WTC; (iii) developed innovative in-reach and outreach strategies that overcome social determinants to
increase early detection and timely access to care; (iv) developed effective tobacco smoking interventions that
have been integrated in to standard clinical practice, as well as in clinical guidelines for persons living with HIV;
(v) implemented comprehensive cervical cancer screening and treatment in Western Africa; and (vi) introduced
a novel appraisal paradigm that emphasizes patients’ own personal criteria for quality of life.

COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overarching goal of the MECC Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) is to promote health equity
and reduce disparities in cancer-related health outcomes in our Bronx catchment area (CA). More than 85% of
patients who come to MECC for cancer care reside in this CA. The Bronx is a community of nearly 1.5 million
residents, with 55% Hispanic/Latinx, 33% Black, 14% White, and 34% identifying with two or more races. Bronx
residents are 35% foreign-born and 26% report difficulty with English. The Bronx is designated as a persistent
poverty county with over 24% of residents living at or below the poverty level. The case mix of patients that come
to MECC reflects this diversity. Cancer incidence in the Bronx is strongly associated with neighborhood poverty.
As such, COE focuses on addressing social determinants of health in partnership with the community.
Our specific aims are to: 1) Define, assess, and monitor cancer burden in the Bronx CA; 2) Develop, implement,
and evaluate the impact of strategies to address the cancer burden; 3) Foster and facilitate catchment area-
relevant research within all MECC Research Programs; 4) Enhance enrollment of underrepresented patients in
clinical trials; and 5) Share lessons learned through dissemination to advance cancer health equity
The MECC COE is led by Bruce Rapkin, PhD, Associate Director for COE. MECC’s COE efforts are built upon
exceptionally strong relationships with community and health system partners. COE activities span the cancer
continuum, from prevention and early detection to treatment to survivorship and supportive care. The COE team
consists of project coordinators, data managers, and community outreach specialists, along with cancer patient
advocates and pre-med interns. COE partners with community, clinic and public health sectors to leverage
established programs and relationships. COE strategies are conceived and guided by a Community Advisory
Board (CAB), COE liaisons from MECC Research Programs, and MECC Senior Leadership to ensure alignment
of action, research, policy and practice. Our Learning Health Care Community logic model fosters on-going data-
driven decision-making and problem-solving among these multiple stakeholders. Ongoing needs assessments
provide direction and iterative feedback on metrics of success. Disseminating MECC research outcomes is
intrinsic to the process. By addressing cancer equity in the broader context of social determinants through
community partnerships, we have been able to arrive at solutions that are making a real difference in our CA.
COE seeks to continue to expand and innovate as we work to become a national model for reducing cancer
incidence and disparities in diverse populations.

dormancy, tumor microenvironment and metastasis; (6) cancer and aging; (7) cancer epidemiology focused on
the Bronx CA patient population; (8) tumor genomics and precision medicine in underserved and
underrepresented groups (URGs); (9) environmental and behavioral factors affecting common cancers in Bronx
CA; and (10) heath disparities, health services, and health implementation science. Four distinct Pilot Project
Programs were developed during the current project period: (1) MECC Team Science Awards; (2) MECC
Translational Research and Investigator-Initiated Clinical Trials Pilot Program; (3) MECC Catchment Area
Research Pilot Program; (4) MECC Research Program Pilot Projects. Use of DF is based upon a rigorous
assessment of MECC strategic needs, as articulated in the Center’s strategic planning process and coordinated
by the MECC’s Senior Leadership Team. A substantial proportion of DF was allocated to support 9 pilot projects
focused on research relevant to the CA. MECC Administration has refined processes for the solicitation and
review of pilot project applications and the allocation of funds. Strategic scientific priorities funded with DF,
relevant to the CA and that directly impact our Bronx patients, include chemoprevention of colon cancer, onco-
fertility and strategies to increase access to services, environmental exposures from air pollution and links to
lung cancer, and understanding barriers to effective diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer for effective
intervention. Future plans for the expenditure of DF in the next project period will continue to reflect priorities
designated in the Strategic Plan. A program under development will focus on new MECC investigators who
identify with an Underrepresented Group (URG) conducting research to address the disproportionate cancer
burden among URGs. The goal of this funding mechanism is to facilitate research that will generate pilot data
for future competitive NCI grant applications.

Medicine and Pediatric trainees. The Program provides multidisciplinary training in basic, translation and clinical
research within the pulmonary and critical care divisions of the Departments of Medicine and Pediatrics and our
three Research Centers devoted to understanding lung health and disease. Our Program offers a Training
Faculty of 48 trainers (38 mentors, 8 junior mentors and 2 co-mentors) from 7 clinical (2) and basic science (5)
departments in the School of Medicine. M.D. trainees will enter at years 3-5 in their clinical and research training,
designed to provide them with skills required for a leadership career in academic pulmonary medicine. Ph.D.
trainees will typically enter in the second year of their post-doctoral fellowship, and they will be well integrated
into the basic, translational and clinical aspects of their project. Each trainee will have a scholarly oversight
committee that includes mentors from varying disciplines who will facilitate their scientific growth and career
development, including grant writing and leadership skills. Each trainee will be welcomed into a DEI culture, will
take workshops, and will become embedded in this culture. Each area of lung research is multidisciplinary in
nature and emphasizes a broader knowledge of the basic, translational, clinical and impact implications for each
trainee's question. Areas of research include cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, idiopathic bronchiectasis,
cell and molecular biology of airway epithelia in health and disease, leukocyte kinetics and clinical research in
COPD, control of airway inflammation, inflammatory and innate immune responses during ARDS and bacterial
and viral infections, clinical trials, comparative effectiveness research, analyses of qualitative narrative data, and
large cohort studies in critical care, basic and translational proteomics of airways and alveoli, the airway
microbiome in health and disease, the responses to injury by physical, chemical, and microbial environmental
agents, and clinical and basic science studies in asthma. Novel programs that exemplify the multi-disciplinary
nature include ARDS and Critical Care Research, the CF Research Program, and Combustion-induced
Bronchitis in the Military, each of which require cross-disciplinary interactions amongst a wide range of expertise
to accomplish their goals. Clinical studies will be integrated with basic observations using translational
physiologic, biochemical, molecular and genetic technologies, and -omics approaches and will provide training
in state-of-the-art –omics and other basic technologies, bioinformatics, database design, use and analyses, and
statistical interpretation. Emphasis is on mechanisms underlying lung diseases in pediatric and adult populations
and development of novel therapeutic strategies. Our Program provides an opportunity for trainees to develop
as scientists and become independent investigators and leaders within the national community."

This Multiple Principal Investigator (MPI) Project proposal for the Pediatric Immunotherapy Network is focused
on high-risk neuroblastoma, a diverse and enigmatic malignancy arising from the developing sympathetic
nervous system that remains lethal in 50% of patients despite intensive multi-modal therapy. There is an urgent
unmet need for developing novel therapeutic interventions to decrease the incidence of relapse, increase overall
survival, and reduce devastating toxicities associated with standard therapy. The primary goal of this Project is
to achieve improved outcomes for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma through the development of a
personalized vaccination strategy targeting individualized neoantigens. The central hypothesis is that high-risk
neuroblastomas, despite a low tumor mutation burden (TMB), harbor a sufficient number of neoepitopes through
canonical and non-canonical mutations to identify, predict, and validate optimal neoantigen peptides to engineer
effective multivalent personalized neuroblastoma vaccines. The motivation for the proposed research is the
urgent need to improve survival and to decrease treatment-related morbidities for patients with high-risk
neuroblastoma. Indeed, the majority of high-risk neuroblastoma patients achieve a remission with standard
therapy, and here we seek to engage the adaptive immune system to eradicate residual disease and prevent
relapse. We will test our hypothesis through the two Specific Aims: 1) define the neoantigen landscape of high-
risk neuroblastoma patient and genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) tumors; 2) develop and test a
readily translatable personalized vaccination strategy. In Aim 1 we will both provide the proof-of-concept that a
multivalent vaccine consisting of both CD4+ and CD8+ epitopes is feasible for each high-risk patient and also
credential our GEMM system for preclinical vaccination trials in Aim 2. We will use an integrative proteogenomic
approach to identify up to eight immunogenic peptides for each personalized vaccine. In Aim 2, we will test both
preventative and therapeutic efficacy of self-assembling nanoparticle multivalent peptide vaccines using our
GEMM system on the CB57BL/6 background, and then compare this vaccine platform to a new lipid-peptide
polymer vaccine system optimized to deliver peptides to dendritic cells. This Project proposes an innovative
experimental strategy to identify, prioritize, and validate neoantigens in high-risk neuroblastoma, and a clinically
relevant neuroblastoma GEMM system for preclinical evaluation of neuroblastoma vaccines. The significance of
the proposed Project is the creation and validation of a novel immunotherapeutic approach that has the potential
to revolutionize high-risk neuroblastoma standard of care by providing durable cures and decreased therapy-
related morbidity. The expected outcome of this collaborative MPI Project is to establish the preclinical proof-of-
concept for a personalized neuroblastoma clinical trial that we would seek to launch in the out years of this grant
given the infrastructure we have in place. The successful completion of this Project will also enable personalized
neoantigen-based vaccine development for other pediatric malignancies."
10895998,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Trauma is common and increases risk for a host of negative health outcomes, most notably posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD). Given the potential harmful sequelae of trauma exposure, it is crucial to identify acute
post-trauma risk factors that predict chronic PTSD. Moreover, urban racial/ethnic minorities can experience
significant environmental stress that puts them at particularly high risk for PTSD. At this juncture relatively little
data exists to aid in prediction of risk specific to urban racial minorities, or that takes into account how
disadvantage and minority stress may impact neurobiological stress systems in the months following trauma,
and how that affects risk for long-term distress. Thus, under the guidance of a community advisory board our
team will 1) identify acute post-trauma neurobehavioral predictors of risk for chronic PTSD among urban Black
Americans, with a focus on prefrontal-subcortical function during processing of threat, 2) characterize how the
longitudinal interaction of socioenvironmental risk and resilience factors and biological stress markers following
trauma impacts risk, and 3) use machine learning to identify the most robust set of predictors of chronic PTSD
drawn from a comprehensive assessment of neuroimaging, biomarkers, self-report and geocoded risk and
resilience variables. We will recruit 190 adults who identify as Black or African American from the Emergency
Department at Froedtert Hospital/Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, and conduct comprehensive
assessments at 2 weeks, and 3, 6, and 12 months following trauma exposure. The two-week and 12-month
assessments will include measures of neural systems for threat processing, including both anticipation of and
reactivity to threat. All visits will include measures of PTSD and other symptoms, neurobiological stress
markers, particularly endocannabinoids, and socioenvironmental risk and resilience factors, especially those
relevant for urban Black Americans. We will examine how acute post-trauma neurocircuitry variables (2 week)
predict PTSD and other outcomes twelve months later, and how pre-trauma environmental variables (resource
deprivation, child maltreatment, violence exposure) moderate this relationship (Aim 1). We will also assess
how, in the months following trauma, socio-environmental risk and resilience factors influence neurobiological
stress systems, and how this interaction impacts risk for PTSD, poor physical health, and emotion regulation
neurocircuitry at twelve months (Aim 2). We will use both hypothesis-driven analyses focusing on a priori
specified predictors (Aims 1 and 2), as well as comprehensive data-driven machine learning analyses (Aim 3).
This approach will allow for determination of the additional utility of neurobiological markers for predicting risk
beyond previously identified self-report indicators. We expect this project to lead to identification of predictors
of PTSD following trauma for urban Black Americans at high risk that are linked to underlying processes
(hyper-responsivity to threat, aberrant neurobiological stress response) that can inform preventive
interventions, ultimately improving the quality of life for urban Black American trauma survivors."
10873169,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This proposal outlines a 5-year training plan for the transition of the candidate to an independent investigator.
The long-term goal of the candidate is to be a physician-scientist at an academic medical center studying the
molecular basis of genetic mutations in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) pathogenesis, in addition to directing
a molecular pathology laboratory. The training plan proposed will expand upon the candidate's clinical and
scientific background and provide him access to a supportive environment that will prepare him for a career as
an independent investigator. The applicant will be mentored by Dr. Matthew Walter, an expert in MDS genetics
and biology and Director of the Edward P. Evans Center for MDS at Washington University (WU). An advisory
committee consisting of basic science and clinical/translational MDS experts and pathologists will provide
scientific and career advice. The applicant's laboratory is well equipped for these studies, and WU provides a
rich environment for training and development as access to core facilities, scientific resources, and clinical
samples is exceptional. The experiments outlined in this application aim to clarify the distinct roles of different
U2AF1 mutants in MDS pathogenesis, as highly recurrent heterozygous mutations in splicing factor genes (e.g.,
U2AF1) occur in over half of MDS patients. Hotspot mutations in U2AF1 (encoding U2AF1S34 and U2AF1Q157
mutants) are associated with different clinical features, outcomes, dysregulated RNA splicing, and co-occurring
gene mutations in patients with MDS. For example, truncating mutations in ASXL1 cooccur more frequently with
U2AF1Q157 than with U2AF1S34 mutations in MDS patients. The candidate has observed U2af1S34F/+ and
U2af1Q157R/+ conditional knock-in mice develop different hematopoietic phenotypes, including cytopenias, and
have distinct gene expression patterns and aberrant RNA splicing in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells
(HSPC). This proposal aims to understand how the distinct molecular perturbations induced by U2AF1S34F and
U2AF1Q157R mutants contribute to the divergent hematopoietic phenotypes observed in MDS patients by
determining: (1) how activation of MYC and mTORC1 pathways leads to HSPC dysfunction and multilineage
cytopenias in U2af1S34F/+ mice and whether U2AF1S34F-specific splicing alterations result in activation of these
pathways, and (2) how mutant ASXL1 and U2AF1Q157 associated histone modification and RNA splicing
aberrancies selectively cooperate in MDS pathogenesis. Deciphering the role of MYC and mTORC1 activation
will allow these models to be used to test pathway-specific therapeutic strategies to alter cytopenias, and
identification of cooperation between ASXL1 and U2AF1 mutations in vivo may reveal novel mechanisms by
which RNA splicing and histone modifications synergize in MDS. In sum, the proposed studies and training
environment will facilitate the candidate's success in becoming an independent investigator."
10916557,"Project Summary
Decades of studying animal development and in vitro human cell culture have produced many observed tight
correlations between the duration of a cell’s cycle and its identity or the fates of its progeny. These links
represent a unique opportunity to understand the regulatory relationships between genetic programs of cell
fate and the regulation of the cell cycle, both central questions in the study of development, tissue
homeostasis, regeneration, and proliferative disorders such as cancer. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans
has been a powerful model in which to study the regulation of cell fate and cell cycle control owing to its
genetic tractability, transparent body and embryo, and stereotyped cell lineage. Like most nematodes, C.
elegans exhibits eutely or a fixed number of somatic cells in each individual of the same sex. Cell fate in the
wild-type animal can thus be determined solely on the basis of its lineage history, for which we have developed
extensive tools and approaches for automated reconstruction via 3D timelapse microscopy. Using C. elegans
and genetic perturbations that result in transformations of cell fate with its lineage, in combination with
automated lineage tracing and spatial transcriptomics approaches, we will investigate the mechanisms by
which cell fate influences the duration of a stem cell’s cell cycle as well as the mechanisms by which the
duration of a cell cycle can influence cell fate.
The work described in this proposal represents a novel approach to considering these links, enabled by our
development of lineage tracing technologies and quantitative approaches to discovering structure in cell
lineages. Building on this expertise, as well as our imaging resources and collaborations with other tools
developers, theorists, and developmental biologists, we will continue to advance the state-of-the-art in lineage-
resolved studies of metazoan development. In particular, using our advances in deep learning techniques to
enable label-free automated lineage tracing in non-model species in which transgenesis remains impossible or
difficult, we will leverage an evolutionary approach to understanding the design principles of gene networks
that drive cell fate decisions and control cell cycle progression in the early embryo. Over the next five years we
will complete detailed characterizations of co-dependencies between cell cycle timing and cell fate in the C.
elegans embryo, create a molecular atlas of cell fate and cell cycle regulation in wild type and mutant C.
elegans where cell fate patterning is perturbed, and complete the reconstruction and quantitative analysis of
the embryonic lineages of S. stercoralis, P. pacificus, and C. angaria. In the long term, we plan to extend our
molecular analyses to these species as well, beginning with C. angaria as an attractive model for studying the
evolution of cell fate control networks and their interactions with regulators of the cell cycle. These insights will
be of broad value to our understanding of developmental processes, and the resources we will establish will
facilitate the work of others on diverse problems in emerging model systems."
10927337,"To maintain organismal energy balance, energy molecules extracted from the diet or liberated from
stored forms must be distributed appropriately throughout the body. By integrating and distributing
signals to and from disparate tissues and organs, the brain plays a major role as a command center
in organismal energy balance. The brain is also a hungry organ, consuming a disproportionate
amount of energy relative to its size. Higher-level cognitive functions like learning and forming
memories burn even more energy. Energy imbalance, such as a chronic high-calorie diet, perturbs
cognitive functions like learning and memory, but the underlying mechanism is not clear. Metabolic
syndromes like obesity are also associated with neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative
disorders. Most studies of organismal energy balance focus on how the brain uses a few known
pathways to mediate inter-organ communication, but it is not known how cognitive functions
specifically signal the brain’s demand for fuel and mobilize energy from stores in other parts of the
body. The proposed studies test an entirely new model in which virus-like particles synthesized during
learning/memory activity in brain neurons travel to fat storage tissues and induce mobilization of
stored energy. Arc (activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein) was known for decades to be
induced by learning/memory activity in neurons, where Arc oligomers promote synaptic activity and
plasticity. Arc proteins evolved from a retrovirus and retained the ability to assemble into virus-like
capsids that spread from cell to cell. A ground-breaking hypothesis to be tested here proposes that
Arc capsids travel from the brain to fat storage cells, where they signal brain activity and trigger
release of energy into circulation. Levels of circulating energy feed back onto Arc expression via
metabolic control of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of Arc mRNA. Together, these coupled
processes are proposed to comprise a homeostatic circuit that integrates the brain’s need for fuel and
maintains organismal energy balance. The experimental system addresses the basic features of this
circuit from the behavioral to the molecular level, including a conserved requirement for Arc in
associative learning and cognitive dysfunction when excess dietary calories overwhelm the system.
The planned research will determine properties of Arc required for communication with fat storage
cells and how it alters organismal metabolism to supply energy to the brain. Other experiments will
identify the key components of diet that alter m6A modification and virus-like Arc assembly and test
custom diets designed to ameliorate cognitive dysfunction. This project will establish the mechanistic
details of a previously unknown brain–adipose signaling axis and a homeostatic circuit where
uncoupling leads to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disease."
10911928,"Project Summary/ Abstract
Animals need to learn and remember the locations of nourishing and toxic food sources for survival and for
adapting to changes in the external environment. It is therefore necessary to associate locations with rewarding
and aversive taste experiences in spatial contexts – these are essentially episodic experiences that form
associative memories of tastes and spatial locations. It is known that the hippocampus is necessary for episodic
memories and formation of spatial cognitive maps, and the gustatory cortex (GC) plays a central role in taste
perception as well as for palatability and valence coding. But how networks of neurons in these two regions
interact to associate taste palatability information with the spatial contexts in which they occur, and how such
interactions drive subsequent behavioral exploration to approach potential food sources, is largely unknown. We
have recently discovered a subset of hippocampal CA1 place cells in rats that discriminate tastes based on
palatability, providing a foundation for addressing these questions. We found that taste responsive CA1 cells
encode taste palatability on a slow timescale in response to taste stimuli, and these taste responses are gated
by the spatial responses of individual cells. Further, we also showed that spatial coding of this taste-responsive
CA1 sub-network is refined through offline reactivation during sharp-wave ripples (SWRs). Here, we will use a
combination of multisite electrophysiology, analyses of behavior, and optogenetic manipulation of inter-regional
connectivity to investigate the role of hippocampal-gustatory cortical interactions in forming a spatial cognitive
map of ecologically relevant food stimuli. In particular, we hypothesize that networks in CA1 and GC interact for
learning, formation, and recall of memories of locations associated with specific taste experiences. We will first
use simultaneous recordings from neural ensembles in GC and CA1 regions as rats learn to associate appetitive
and aversive tastes with specific locations in an adaptable maze, quantifying how exploration paths change with
taste experience. We will investigate the development of taste-location coding in CA1 and the coordination of
GC and CA1 activity in service of palatability coding at food source locations. Next, we will test if SWRs in
hippocampus at food sources are associated with taste-specific reactivation simultaneously in CA1 and GC, and
whether there is coordination of reactivation of taste and location information that can support taste-location
associations. Finally, we will use optogenetic perturbation of the input from the taste system to the hippocampus
during food sampling to test if this will disrupt formation of discriminative memories for spatial locations of
preferred tastes. Together, these aims will provide crucial insight into how networks in the hippocampus interact
with primary sensory cortical networks that mediate taste perception, in order to embed ethologically relevant
food information in the spatial cognitive map, thus enabling animals to successfully navigate a taste-space
cognitive map."
11009479,"Familial dysautonomia (FD), also known as HSAN type III or Riley-Day syndrome, is a rare, fatal, congenital
sensory and autonomic neuropathy caused by a “leaky” RNA splicing defect that results in reduced levels of
ELP1 protein mainly in the nervous system. Patients with FD have a complex neurological phenotype with
diminished pain and temperature perception, decreased or absent myotatic reflexes, proprioceptive gait ataxia,
and progressive retinal degeneration. After identifying kinetin as a small molecule able to correct the ELP1
splicing defect, we worked as part of the NIH Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network to optimize the potency and
efficacy of kinetin and create a new class of splicing modulator compounds (SMCs). In 2015, we partnered with
PTC Therapeutics to further develop these compounds with the goal of bringing a new drug to FD patients. After
four years of highly collaborative work, PTC Therapeutics canceled the FD program in late 2019 due to budgetary
constraints associated with the development of a drug for such a rare patient population. The goal of this
proposal is to complete the IND-enabling studies for our lead compound, PTC680, and to conduct a Phase I
clinical trial taking full advantage of the expertise and guidance of BPN consultants and contractors. PTC680 is
an excellent development candidate: 1) It is a potent modulator of ELP1 splicing both in vitro and in vivo and,
importantly, leads to an increase in functional ELP1 protein in mice in all tissues, including brain, 2) Discovery
stage projects are complete and a reasonable synthesis scheme has been developed, and 3) It has a good
ADME profile, limited potential for drug-drug interactions and similar protein binding across species. Therefore,
preclinical data should promptly translate to the clinic. The proposed project will enter at the Development stage
and will use the expertise of NIH contractors to move PTC680 to the clinic. In the UG3 phase, we will perform
the preparatory work for the IND-enabling studies including further optimization of the synthesis strategy to
produce enough material for the proposed studies, and determine a suitable formulation. During the development
phase (UH3) will use the BPN CROs to conduct the IND-enabling studies and the Phase I clinical trial in healthy
individuals. During this phase of the program, we will be responsible for overall project management together
with the CDT, assembly, and submission of the IND application, and all communications with the FDA. We are
confident that with the support of the Blueprint network, we will be successful in our quest to finally bring a
disease-modifying therapy to FD patients."
10908579,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We aim to renew a highly productive collaboration that has developed revolutionary new ultrasound imaging
hardware and processing approaches. Our innovative technologies have enabled high-signal-to-noise and high-
resolution contrast-enhanced microvascular imaging. Specifically, we developed the world’s first ultra-broadband
co-axial dual-frequency linear arrays, which enable transmission of ultrasound at low frequencies and reception
of high-frequency content from microbubbles well beyond their 7th harmonic. These transducers enable
superharmonic imaging, which provides high-resolution contrast images of the microvasculature with essentially
no tissue background and is used for visualizing vessels on the order of 100 microns in both animal and human
tissues. Significantly, we have utilized these tools to image microvascular angiogenesis, known for decades to
be a biomarker of cancer, yet not previously possible to image directly with ultrasound. Our ‘acoustic
angiography’ imaging readily shows drastic differences in microvasculature density and structure between
malignant cancers and healthy tissue, providing superior sensitivity and specificity to early micro-breast tumors
in mice genetically predisposed to breast cancer. Furthermore, our excellent superharmonic signal separation
enables super-resolution imaging without the cumbersome spatiotemporal filtering approaches otherwise used
for this process, which are readily corrupted by tissue motion or slow flow. Our next generation approach will
enable outstanding microvascular resolution (<100 um) in deep tissue (4-8 cm), despite slow microvascular flow,
and with robustness to tissue motion. Despite our advances in hardware and imaging techniques, challenges
remain to make our technology optimal for imaging human cancers. The shallow focal depth of the arrays
designed in the prior project period, limited by prototype array and lens designs, and carried over from their
original small-animal imaging applications, is far from optimized for the 3-4 cm depth needed to image suspicious
breast lesions in humans. In this renewal, we will direct the development and optimization of dual-frequency
arrays specifically for deeper clinical imaging (targeting depths up to 8cm). Our loss in resolution due to lower
frequency bandwidths will be recovered by superharmonic super-resolution processing. We have demonstrated
this approach with excellent results using the prototype dual frequency arrays, enabling recovery of sub-100
micron resolution, even with frequencies that can penetrate 6-8 cm. Furthermore, since microvascular imaging
provides the most diagnostic information when acquired in 3D, we will develop the first dual-frequency 2D arrays.
Successful completion of these aims will advance ultrasound imaging closer to a practical clinical modality for
identifying and assessing angiogenic and molecular biomarkers of cancer with high specificity and sensitivity for
future applications such as differentiation of suspicious lesions, assessment of response to therapy, and early
detection. Combined with the hardware development, we will optimize acoustic parameters, develop
beamforming and imaging strategies, and test performance in preclinical and clinical populations."

Shigella and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are two of the most important diarrheal pathogens
worldwide, causing significant disease in young children in developing countries and in U.S. travelers, including
military personnel, who visit developing countries. Both pathogens have been designated by WHO, CDC and
NIAID as priorities for the development of new interventions due to the significant disease burden of these
increasingly antimicrobial resistant organisms. A combined vaccine provides additive value by targeting two
important enteropathogens with a single formulation. We have developed 2 lead prototype Shigella-ETEC
vaccine candidates that include the most important components of a broadly protective vaccine. CVD 1208S-
321 consists of an attenuated Shigella flexneri 2a strain engineered to express ETEC colonization factor CFA/I
and the LTA2 and B subunits of heat-labile enterotoxin from genes integrated into the Shigella chromosome.
CVD 1233-SP::CS2-CS-V2 consists of attenuated S. sonnei engineered with a novel stabilized virulence plasmid
modification that provides a transformative advantage for stable and consistent vaccine production and
immunogenicity. This strain is engineered for optimal expression of ETEC antigens CS2 and CS3 from the
chromosome. Animal models confirmed the induction of protective immune responses by both vaccine strains
against these two important human diarrheal pathogens. The overall goal of this proposal is to translate these
prototype Shigella-ETEC vaccine constructs from academic research laboratory vaccine candidates to potential
human vaccines ready to enter Phase 1 clinical trials (under other funding). Several industrial partners have
been engaged to supply the required expertise to assure success of this process. The Walter Reed Army institute
of Research Pilot Bioproduction Facility (WRAIR PBF), a world expert in Shigella vaccine production, will produce
cGMP cell banks and pilot vaccine lots with documentation required for IND submission. CVD will perform pre-
clinical IND-enabling studies with supporting documentation sufficient for vaccine advancement. Experts from
Biologics Consulting will oversee all steps in the development and documentation process to assure compliance
with requirements for FDA INDs. Vaccine Company Inc., a newly formed company that is committed to the rapid
development and deployment of vaccines for global use, will provide consultation and overall strategic guidance
for the ultimate expedient deployment of these vaccines. The collective expertise of the assembled team will
ensure expeditious development of Shigella-ETEC vaccine candidates with requisite FDA conformity for rapid
advancement to clinical trials and deployment to target populations.

 The overall objective of this SCORE is to elucidate sex differences in cardiometabolic disease and its risk
factors and treatments using genetically modified mouse models, inbred mouse strains, and in vitro or cell-based
experiments. However, another important component of the SCORE is to translate findings from model systems
to humans. The Human Translational Bioinformatics Core will fulfill this goal by serving as the hub for
computational and in silico analyses that translate findings from the three Projects for association and relevance
to cardiometabolic traits in humans, thereby enhancing the overall research results of the SCORE. The Core
will be led by Dr. Hooman Allayee, whose own research program has developed numerous bioinformatics and
analytical pipelines to efficiently and systematically evaluate the role of candidate gene/molecular/biomarker
targets in cardiometabolic diseases using large human datasets. Furthermore, the computational infrastructure
is in place and access to a wide array of 'omics data is already available from numerous multi-ancestry cohorts.
Taken together, these tools have been successfully applied in prior studies and will serve as the paradigm for
how the Core will support the three SCORE Projects. Specific Aim 1 will use these resources to investigate
sexually dimorphic candidate gene/pathway, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic biomarkers identified
by the three Projects for relevance to human populations. These analyses will leverage primary-level data (i.e.
genotypes, clinical outcomes, and biomarker levels) from several population- and hospital-based cohorts with a
combined sample size of >500K subjects. As such, epidemiological, genetic, and causal association analyses
can be carried out with increased granularity. Specific Aim 2 will complement this approach by leveraging
publicly available summary-level data for various `omics data from large-scale genome-wide association studies
(GWAS). This strategy will provide even greater power and expand the bioinformatics analyses to additional
clinical, proteomic, and metabolomic traits due to the large number of subjects and diverse outcomes in the
studies from which the data are drawn. Finally, Specific Aim 3 will create a web-based resource that houses the
internally driven and publicly available data from the first two Aims, which will be made available to the three
SCORE Projects and, in a controlled manner, to the broader research community. The resource will be
developed with PheWeb, an easily implementable and widely used open-source tool for visualizing, navigating,
and sharing GWAS and phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) results. The goal will be to provide an
intuitive and searchable interface for exploring genetic associations of candidate genes/variants with `omics traits
in humans. The culmination of Core activities may, in turn, reveal additional biological information and lead to
new hypotheses that can then be investigated mechanistically by the same basic science approaches being
used by the three Projects. The collective experience of its leadership/personnel in carrying out the proposed
bioinformatics analyses ensures an important contribution from the Core to the overall success of this SCORE."

10912711,"Project Summary
Through existing advances in the field of radiation oncology, it has become clear that success is best
achieved when experts in biology, physics, and clinical medicine collaborate. However, as technology
and treatment paradigms grow more complex, it has become increasingly difficult for experts to
maintain cutting-edge specialization in their own specific discipline and at the same time, converge to
facilitate multi-disciplinary collaboration. While current graduate training does expose trainees to fields
outside their own, this exposure is insufficient to develop meaningful research collaborations across
the modern oncology workforce. A formal training program that can provide both breadth and depth in
the theme areas of tumor biology, tumor immune microenvironment, advanced imaging and treatment
technologies, and informatics is needed to allow trainees to develop a set of common cross-disciplinary
fundamentals that can then be used to accelerate multidisciplinary research in radiation oncology.
Given the amount of data generated in the fields of cancer biology, medical physics, and clinical
radiation oncology, we envision that our ROBIN program cross training core, METEORITE (METEOR
Integrated Training Environment), will use data science and informatics as the common language to
facilitate communication and promote interdisciplinary collaboration, with the ultimate goal of leveraging
this model across the ROBIN network to increase collaboration among the larger oncology workforce.
In Aim 1, we will first develop an interdisciplinary training program within our own METEOR ROBIN
Center by integrating pre-existing courses and established training programs to support METEOR and
related science. Trainees will develop an individualized training pathway that will allow them to partake
in common coursework while also customizing their learning. In Aim 2, we will develop new digital
content resources for key high need topics such as clinical trial design and the fundamentals of TME
for non-specialists to be used within METEORITE but also disseminated across the wider ROBIN
network. Finally, in Aim 3, we will develop and host both in-person and virtual seminar series and
symposia to promote trainee cohesion within METEOR and across the ROBIN network. The goal of
these seminar series and symposia is to develop leadership skills among ROBIN network trainees and
also to ensure our developed content can be disseminated and used to promote interdisciplinary
collaboration in the future workforce. Through funding of METEORITE, we will generate resources and
career development expertise that will facilitate a future NIH T32 application focused on training,
disseminating and advancing multidisciplinary informatic partnerships radiation oncology."

Ewing sarcoma (EWS) is the second most common tumor involving bone in children and young adults and is
fatal in most patients with metastatic or relapsed disease. Patients who survive are left with a lifetime of late
effects from the toxic therapy they receive. There have been no new, successful targeted drugs developed to
treat EWS for nearly forty years, and we have reached the limit on how much we can intensify chemotherapy
treatments. New therapeutic approaches are necessary to prevent relapse and cure more patients.
Immunotherapy has altered the treatment landscape for many adult solid tumors but has not yet mediated
substantial benefit for children with EWS. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have revolutionized the
treatment of children with relapsed leukemia and lymphoma. Recently, we found that CAR T cells targeting GD2,
a sugar expressed on the surface of many pediatric cancers, are active in children with incurable brain tumors.
This proposal focuses on applying GD2 CAR T cells to EWS. Because GD2 is heterogeneously expressed on
EWS, we will explore multiple mechanisms to effectively apply CAR T cells in this disease: 1) targeting a closely
related ganglioside that is highly expressed when GD2 is low and 2) utilizing epigenetic inhibitors to significantly
increase GD2, making CAR T cells better able to recognize tumor cells. In Aim 1, we will define the expression
of gangliosides and their related synthase enzymes on patient tissues and test CARs against an alternative
ganglioside. In Aim 2, we will utilize epigenetic inhibitors to increase GD2 on EWS tumors in vitro and in vivo. In
Aim 3, we will test combinatorial approaches of CAR T cells and epigenetic inhibitors. Successful completion of
these studies will result in new therapeutic options for children with Ewing sarcoma."

inquiry using pharmacologic strategies to address important biomedical questions. With this application, we
request funds to support 7 predoctoral trainees, who will be appointed to the training grant during their second
and third years of study. The PSTP curriculum includes rigorous didactic instruction and three research
rotations during the first year with selection of a thesis advisor in February of that year. During the second
year, students develop an independent research project and take a written and oral advancement to candidacy
examination. The following three years consist largely of a research project focusing on collaboration and
publication culminating in a written dissertation and seminar. Integral to the PSTP are activities that enable
trainees to: a) understand responsible conduct of research (RCR) and laboratory safety, b) develop skills in
rigor & reproducibility, c) receive and give feedback during evaluation, d) develop career interests, including
use of Individual Development Plans, e) improve written and oral communication skills, and f) learn critical
analysis via journal clubs and seminars. Research in the PSTP is inter-disciplinary and includes intermediary
metabolism, neuroscience, infectious disease, immunology, membrane biophysics, drug discovery and design,
and proteomics. The PSTP is based in the Department of Pharmacology and nearly all trainees are
Pharmacology PhD students with an occasional Neuroscience program PhD student. The PSTP preceptors
are 25 faculty drawn from 8 different academic departments across UVA’s research enterprise. These faculty
are evaluated by the PSTP Steering Committee for research excellence, mentoring skills, and commitment to
diversity. Faculty are required to compete mentor training before accepting a PSTP trainee. Oversight of the
PSTP program is achieved by the Steering Committee aided by an expert Internal Advisory Committee. The
PSTP builds on 45+ years of educational excellence in the Pharmacological Sciences that has no equivalent
elsewhere at UVA. Historically, the PSTP mentors have included 2 Nobel laureates. Approximately 8 students
are enrolled annually from a pool of ~200 applicants after a rigorous, holistic application process culminating
with in-person interviews. Matriculants from under-represented minority (URM) groups now represent ~20% of
the total, with an overall F:M ratio of ~2:1. The URM candidates, those from disadvantaged backgrounds and
students with disabilities are actively sought in outreach programs such as a highly successful undergraduate
Summer Research Training Program (SRIP). UVA PSTP graduates are highly sought-after in academia,
industry, and public service due to their excellence as research scientists."

Antimalarial drug resistance is a continuing challenge in the global effort to control and eliminate malaria. Well designed,
rapid and highly granular antimalarial surveillance systems are urgently needed to protect the efficacy of remaining
antimalarial treatments and inform discovery of new, effective drugs and vaccines. Molecular markers are useful tools to
monitor anti-malarial drug resistance and, if used in routine surveillance, could help to detect and monitor the early
emergence of resistance before it translates to treatment failures.
This project will address the need for more powerful molecular surveillance through a strategic collaboration between
two geographically and scientifically complementary, Africa-based networks - the DS-I Africa INFORM Research Hub
and the West African Center for Cell Biology for Infectious Pathogens (WACCBIP). Akros and the Institute for Human
Virology Nigeria, both part of the INFORM Research hub, will collaborate with WACCBIP to strengthen Ghana’s malaria
genomic surveillance network to include capture of community-level, geo enabled dried blood spot (DBS) samples and
expand this network to include additional epidemiologic and genomic data streams across geographies in Africa. This
partnership will leverage WACCBIP’s existing genomic surveillance ‘hub-and-spoke’ lab network and integrate the network
with the work of the DS-I Africa INFORM Research hub.
The deliberate, strategic plan to integrate WACCBIP with partners within DS-I Africa will expand geographic coverage
of geospatial surveillance through pivoting the open-source ‘Reveal’ geospatial platform already in use by DS-I Africa.
With the use of Reveal, the consortium will geoenable WACCBIP’s existing malaria genomic surveillance network and
expand the platform to link DBS data collected at the household level to advanced next generation sequencing (NGS) labs.
Through this project, stakeholders will be equipped to visualize and monitor molecular markers of antimalarial resistance
captured from the DBS samples, and geospatially align these genomic data to other data streams including epidemiologic,
programmatic, and socio-demographic data to inform intervention response. The linking and geoenabling of the existing
surveillance network to the Reveal platform will increase granular geospatial and temporal antimalarial resistance
insights to guide responsive action and drive epidemiological understanding of antimalarial resistance emergence and
spread.
We envision this project will provide a model for a) geoenabled community-level genomic surveillance, b) better
understanding of the manifestation of antimalarial resistance at a granular level, and c) timely access to critical evidence
to guide national decision-making for malaria program response and adaptation."
10931412,"Abstract
Covalent inhibitors represent some of the most successful drugs in human history, including aspirin and
penicillin. Recently, targeted covalent drugs have taken center stage as a compelling approach for achieving
major goals in oncology that have proven elusive for more classical reversible small molecules, including, for
instance, the selective inactivation of oncogenic kinases (BTK, EGFR, FGFR, JAK3) and, most notably, the
inhibition of the once-deemed undruggable KRAS protein. We are now in the midst of a resurgence of interest
in covalent drugs for their demonstrated capability to engage cancer targets that have been historically
considered undruggable. However, despite their proven success and inherent advantages of potency, there
has been a general reluctance to develop covalent drugs due to the concern of potential irreversible off-target
toxicity across different organ systems. Hence, a comprehensive understanding of both on and off-targets in
vivo is critical for covalent drugs. Currently, it is impossible to determine drug binding across a whole animal
with cellular and molecular resolution in mammals.
Building upon a recent breakthrough in tissue imaging termed CATCH (Clearing-Assisted Tissue click
Chemistry), we propose to develop a general platform for in vivo imaging of drug-target interactions with
unprecedented spatial precision by integrated applications of high-resolution whole-body imaging and
chemoproteomics (such as Activity-Based Proteomic Profiling, or ABPP) through the same covalent probes.
This way, every cell in a living mammal targeted by the drug (both on- and off-target) can be revealed in situ
and registered onto a defined protein map to screen and identify in vivo drug targets. The data stream
generated by this platform could rapidly link the rich knowledge of drug affinity to the therapeutic index,
therefore accelerating the translation of chemical activities into cancer therapies.
Our team has well-established and complementary expertise in chemoproteomics and tissue imaging to
ensure the successful execution of the project. In this IMAT R33 application, we plan to further develop
CATCH to profile in vivo targets of covalent kinase inhibitors. First, we will adapt CATCH to 3D somatic tissues
(Aim 1). Next, we will expand CATCH to an array of covalent BTK (Bruton’s tyrosine kinase) inhibitors (Aim 2).
Finally, we will profile dose-dependent in vivo cellular targets of BTK inhibitors in the mouse cardiovascular
system (Aim 3). We anticipate that these studies will establish in vivo CATCH methods for identifying targets of
covalent BTK inhibitors to better understand their efficacy and toxicity. More generally, the established platform
can be broadly applied to any covalent cancer drug for unbiased in vivo target identification. The pipeline,
analytics, and high-resolution drug target data will be rapidly disseminated for public access and exploration,
releasing an immediate, direct, and profound impact on covalent cancer drug discovery and refinement."
10878994,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a devastating disease carrying high morbidity and mortality due to the high
likelihood of fatal dissection and rupture. There are currently no proven pharmaceutical treatments to prevent
AAA progression. VSMC degeneration contributes largely to AAA pathogenesis, but the mechanism remains
elusive. The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) serves as an essential protein quality control mechanism by
degrading misfolded proteins and surplus normal proteins. While proteotoxicity resulting from insufficient UPS
function has been widely accepted as an important mechanism for multiple degenerative human conditions, the
implication of UPS dysfunction in AAA is completely unknown. Our pathway analysis in human AAA tissues
revealed an association of UPS function with AAA. In a mouse model of AAA, accumulation of ubiquitinated
proteins, a hallmark of impaired UPS performance, precedes VSMC degeneration and AAA formation and is
exacerbated with disease progression. This suggests that inadequate UPS performance may act as a novel
mechanism underlying AAA etiology. MYOCD is a master switch of VSMC contractile gene program. How
MYOCD is regulated and functions in AAA is unknown. Bulk RNA-seq in VSMCs showed an enrichment of UPS-
related pathways in the top MYOCD-upregulated gene programs besides those relevant to VSMC contraction.
Forced expression of MYOCD improved UPS performance while suppressing VSMC degeneration in cultured
VSMCs and VSMC-specific MYOCD transgenic (Tg) mice at the early stage of AAA formation. MYOCD
increased the expression of NFE2L1 and KLHL3, two key players of UPS function. These lines of evidence
suggest a novel role of MYOCD in UPS function. Phosphodiesterases (PDEs), by catalyzing the hydrolysis of
cAMP and cGMP to specifically modulate cyclic nucleotide signaling, play critical roles in VSMC pathophysiology
and are proven drug targets for multiple human diseases. We found that PDE10A was the most induced PDE
family member during AAA formation, while MYOCD protein expression was suppressed. Inhibition of PDE10A
increased MYOCD protein, improved UPS performance, and suppressed AAA formation. These exciting
preliminary findings support a novel hypothesis that downregulation of MYOCD protein by PDE10A impairs UPS
performance, leading to VSMC degeneration and AAA. We propose three Aims to test this hypothesis. Aim 1
will use novel VSMC-specific Myocd knockout and Tg mice to determine the function of MYOCD in AngII-induced
AAA model. Aim 2 will use a novel UPS reporter mouse line and biochemical assays to determine the importance
of UPS function in MYOCD-regulated AAA and how MYOCD modulates UPS function. Aim 3 will determine how
PDE10 promotes MYOCD protein degradation and PDE10A functions in UPS performance and AAA formation.
This proposal will address for the first time the importance of UPS performance in VSMC degeneration and AAA
formation, and elucidate a novel regulatory cascade comprising a druggable upstream modulator (PDE10A) and
a downstream effector (MYOCD) in safeguarding UPS performance and proteostasis."

BIOSTATISTICS SHARED RESOURCE - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The increasing variety and complexity of data types, analytic approaches and study designs utilized in cancer
research necessitate the availability of an organized and centralized biostatistics resource that can offer a wide
range of statistical expertise, collaboration, and training opportunities to investigators at the Montefiore Einstein
Cancer Center (MECC). The Biostatistics Shared Resource (BSR) is staffed by experienced statisticians with
strong track records in effective collaboration across all scientific programs, innovative research in cancer
relevant statistical areas, and in training and mentoring investigators at all levels. BSR personnel have critical
roles in enhancing the Center infrastructure and fostering multi-disciplinary team science given their broad
knowledge of the scope of research activities within the MECC and active involvement on various cancer center
committees. The specific objectives of the BSR are: (i) To provide state-of-the-art biostatistical and bioinformatic
support on all phases of cancer research, from experimental design and study conduct to data analysis and
manuscript preparation; (ii) To collaborate on the development of methodologically rigorous grant applications
and new research initiatives; (iii) To assist with the development and scientific review of clinical trial protocols;
(iv) To develop innovative biostatistics and bioinformatics approaches to address analytical challenges from new
technologies in cancer research; (v) To offer a wide range of biostatistics training opportunities to MECC
members and to mentor junior cancer investigators; (vi) To enhance the MECC infrastructure and foster
interdisciplinary collaborations via participation on scientific and administrative committees and interactions with
other shared resources.
In the next funding period, to be in line with the strategic research priorities of the MECC, the BSR will focus on
strengthening methodological expertise to address the anticipated needs of existing and newly recruited MECC
researchers. Specifically, we have recently established the Subcore of Clinical Trials Methodology focusing on
novel clinical trials and pragmatic trials on cancer screening and therapy. In addition, we aim to increase
expertise in machine learning approaches that can integrate clinical, laboratory, and different types of high
dimensional omics data on cancer etiology, prognosis and precision medicine and prevention and to increase
research to address health disparities.
The overall goal in accomplishing these objectives is to provide a robust, comprehensive and cost-effective
system of statistical support for MECC investigators that contributes significantly to advancing the understanding
of cancer etiologies and prognosis, as well as improving cancer prevention, detection and treatment strategies.

The overall goal of the Flow Cytometry Shared Resource (FCSR) is to provide a broad array of advanced cell
analysis and isolation resources for a wide range of cancer-relevant studies carried out by basic and translational
scientists in the MECC. As a central component of its mission, the FCSR provides access to instrumentation and
expertise for analytical flow cytometry and fluorescence activated cell sorting. These resources are critical for a
large cohort of MECC scientists who use these technologies on a regular basis in their studies to explore the
biology of cancer and develop new therapeutics. Analytical flow cytometers housed in the FCSR include the
most advanced multispectral analyzers currently available (Cytek Aurora), with capabilities for rapid analysis of
>25 parameters per cell. A range of cell sorters are also provided, including cuvette type (FACSAria) and jet-in-
air type (MoFlow and Astrios) high speed sorters. FCSR has also recently acquired the most cutting edge, newly
developed multispectral cell sorter (ThermoFisher Bigfoot), which elevates the speed, accuracy and complexity
of cell sorting capabilities to unprecedented levels. In addition to its state-of-the-art core technologies in flow
cytometry, the FCSR has also expanded to incorporate several new related and complementary technology
platforms for immune monitoring of cancers in human subjects and animal models. These include the recent
acquisition of a multi-channel fluorescence slide scanning system (VectraPolaris), and equipment for gene
expression profiling at single cell and microscopic tissue levels (NanoString). FCSR provides technical expertise
and training to guide MECC investigators at all levels in the application of basic and advanced flow cytometry
and its other supported technologies. Services and training are supported by a full-time staff consisting of three
highly experienced research faculty level operations directors who carry out advanced technical procedures,
supervise training activities and manage the daily operations. There are also four experienced and highly trained
technicians who support equipment operation and maintenance. Ongoing review of new developments in areas
relevant to the FCSR by the senior faculty scientific director and faculty advisory group of the facility assures that
MECC investigators have access to the most advanced current and newly emerging technologies for cell
analysis and isolation. FCSR also organizes and supports seminars and demonstrations of new technologies to
ensure that MECC investigators are well informed about newly emerging applications of FACS and other related
technologies that can enhance their research. The technologies provided by FCSR are essential to the research
activities of MECC investigators and cannot be outsourced or obtained at other sites in any practical or cost-
effective way. FCSR serves as a critical component of MECC Shared Resources, and is a major pillar of support
for a wide range of cancer-focused basic and translational research.

10915554,"Project Summary:
 The Primary cilium is an organelle that majority of human cells possess with only one per a cell.
This immotile cellular structure senses extracellular signaling via receptors that specifically
accumulate on the ciliary portion of the cellular membrane. Dysfunction in the structure or the
function of the organelle results in pleiotropic disorders called ciliopathies, which include
obesity and retinal degeneration. The cilium needs to be disassembled prior to mitosis, as cells
use centrosome, from which the cilium extends, as spindle poles. Cells reassemble the cilium in
G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. My lab at University of Oklahoma Health Science Center
interrogates the molecular mechanisms of the formation of the cilium. The initial step of the
cilium formation is recruitment of a ciliary vesicle, to the distal end of the mother centriole. The
small vesicles fuse to form a larger vesicle, which finally merges with plasma membrane to form
the primary cilium. While the attachment of the ciliary vesicle to the centriole is the first step,
many important questions remain to be elucidated. One potential problem that has hampered
our understanding of the ciliary vesicle is the lack of markers of the ciliary vesicle. To overcome
this challenge, I previously characterized a small GTPase, RAB34, a more specific marker for the
ciliary vesicle, and determined that Neuronal Calcium Sensor-1 (NCS1) captures the ciliary
vesicle using its myristoylation motif at the ciliary base. Using these proteins as powerful
biochemical tools, we will focus on answering key unsolved questions including the composition
and origin of the ciliary vesicle. We will isolate the ciliary vesicle to uncover the lipid and
protein composition of the vesicle, monitor the movement of the ciliary vesicle from its
emergence to reveal the origin of the vesicle, and screen for the regulators that determine how
the vesicle is generated and transported to the centriole. If successful, our research projects
will uncover the largely unexplored molecular mechanisms of the early step of the cilium
formation, which will pave the way to get to the root of the pathogenesis of the syndrome
caused by ciliary dysfunction."

More than 40,000 women die each year of metastatic breast cancer. The majority of these tumors are hormone
receptor positive (HR+) that are treated with a cyclin dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor in combination
with an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant. With these treatments, women with advanced breast cancer are
living longer, but treatment related toxicities inevitably occur, and quality of life is limited by side effects of
cancer treatment which may result in dose reductions and delays. Fatigue is the most commonly cited adverse
side effect reported for women taking CDK4/6 inhibitors and mechanistically may be associated with
inflammation. When unmanaged, fatigue is debilitating directly impacting both psychological and physical
quality of life and a key driver in discontinuation of therapy. Lifestyle interventions targeting diet and exercise
have evidence for improving fatigue in early stage breast cancer, however whether these strategies are
efficacious for improving outcomes in women with advanced breast cancer remains unknown, with even less
information for women from underrepresented backgrounds, who suffer disproportionately from breast cancer
and its treatment. Research regarding the impact of these strategies on high grade fatigue induced by CDK4/6
inhibitors in advanced disease from a diverse patient population are needed.
 The prolonged overnight Fasting and/or Exercise on fatigue and other patient reported
outcomes in women with hormone Receptor positive advanced breast cancer (FastER) study, will
evaluate a phase II, 2 x 2 randomized controlled trial testing the effects of a prolonged overnight fasting (POF)
intervention alone, moderate-intensity exercise alone, or in combination, on fatigue in 260 women with
advanced breast cancer initiating treatment with hormonal therapy in combination with a CDK4/6 inhibitor.
Participants would undergo assessment of fatigue and associated inflammatory biomarkers, as well as
assessment of physical activity, diet, physical function, body composition and patient reported outcomes at
baseline (prior to the initiation of CDK4/6 inhibitor) and 12 weeks (post-intervention), 6 and 12 months after
study enrollment. The primary outcome of the study is to evaluate the impact of the interventions (vs control)
on fatigue in women at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes include inflammatory biomarkers, patient-reported
outcomes, physical function and body composition. The FastER study will also explore the impact of the
intervention on circadian rhythms, fatigue, sleep, depression, anxiety, quality of life, physical function and body
composition.
The overarching goal of the FastER study is to determine whether prolonged overnight fasting or moderate-
intensity exercise alone or in combination can mitigate the adverse consequences of treatment and improve
fatigue and other outcomes, in women with advanced breast cancer treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors to ultimately
improve both quantity and quality of life for this growing population of women."
10912668,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Laryngeal dystonia (LD) is a neurological disorder that selectively affects speech production due to
involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles. As speech communication is a vital part of our daily existence,
LD symptoms have a pervasive effect on the quality of life of the affected individual, often extending beyond
speech motor deficits and causing significant occupational disability, psychiatric comorbidities, long-lasting
stress, and social isolation. Despite the chronic, debilitating impact of LD, its clinical management remains
challenging. The current treatment of LD is mostly limited to the temporary relief of voice symptoms with
repeated injections of botulinum toxin into the laryngeal muscles, which, however, are not effective in all
patients. Thus, there is an urgent clinical need to develop next-generation therapeutic interventions that are
informed by LD-specific pathophysiology for their most effective outcome in the majority of patients. Our long-
term goal is to determine the causes and pathophysiology of LD and to establish enhanced diagnostics and
treatment of this disorder. The overall objective of this study is to conduct a randomized, double-blind, sham-
controlled, parallel design, phase 1 clinical trial to assess the feasibility and efficacy of a neurofeedback brain-
computer interface (BCI) paradigm in LD patients that acts upon and modulates the disorder pathophysiology.
Our central hypothesis is that the disorder-specific neural patterns, which are distinctly associated with
symptomatic speech vs. asymptomatic whisper, maybe successfully targeted and modulated with
neurofeedback BCI intervention for rehabilitation of speech production in LD patients. Our central hypothesis
will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: (1) develop neural signatures of task-characteristic activity during
symptomatic and asymptomatic speech motor behaviors in LD patients, and (2) assess the feasibility and
efficacy of neurofeedback BCI therapeutic intervention in LD patients. The rationale for the proposed studies is
that delineation of task-specific neural signatures in LD will establish a robust scientific foundation for their
utilization as a feasible pathophysiological target of novel BCI therapeutic intervention. This research is
significant because it is expected to have a meaningful translational impact by informing the conduct of the
next phase of the clinical trial in LD patients and thus directly contribute to closing the critically existing gap in
the clinical management of this disorder. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it
uses a controlled experimental design and advanced methodologies to target disorder-specific central
pathophysiology of LD for the development of new non-invasive treatment for these patients."

In this application, we propose to build upon the highly successful multidisciplinary training program in
microbiology, immunology and infectious disease we have developed at the University of Vermont over the
past 14 years. The goal of the Vermont Immunobiology and Infectious Disease (VI2D) training program, which
supports four predoctoral students per year, is to produce outstanding independent biomedical scientists who
are equipped to study infectious disease mechanisms, prevention, and treatment. To date, we have had 19
trainees, 13 of whom have completed their PhDs in an average of 5.3 years; the other six are still in training.
Our trainees have published an average of 5.7 papers from their doctoral research (2.6 as first author) and
have been included on nine patents. Eleven of the 19 trainees have been women (58%), and five (26%) have
been from groups underrepresented in the scientific workforce. Importantly, all 13 of our graduates continue to
pursue careers in science or medicine. The average duration of T32 support has been 2.4 years, with a
maximum of 3, and the trainees have been distributed broadly among our 16 Faculty Mentors. The mentors
include a mix of basic, translational, and clinical researchers, with 12 Ph.D., one Ph.D./D.V.M., and three M.D.
faculty members. These training faculty are well funded (total current annual extramural support of $10.6
million), highly collaborative, and have a strong, demonstrated commitment to mentoring and graduate
education. At the core of the intellectual environment supporting the program are this engaged group of Faculty
Mentors, the graduate program in Cellular, Molecular and Biomedical Sciences (CMB), and two vibrant
Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence funded by NIH COBRE grants: the Vermont Center for
Immunobiology and Infectious Disease and the Translational Global Infectious Diseases Research Center.
Institutional support for the training program is exceptional. Training grant-eligible applicants are drawn from
the rich pool of students in the CMB Program and undergo a rigorous selection process before being appointed
to the training grant. The VI2D program has been designed to give our trainees a deep understanding of the
basic science underpinnings of immunology and microbial pathogenesis. In addition, and new to the program
going forward, our trainees will a) gain real-world exposure to clinical aspects of infectious and immunological
disease, through our “Clinical Connection” program that fosters interaction between the trainees and clinicians,
and b) become better prepared to function as effective research scientists through training in key aspects of
the “Practice of Science,” including effective communication skills, team building, career development, and
personal wellness. A detailed plan for regular internal and external evaluation of the program will enable us to
continuously evolve and improve the training experience. The integrated, well-resourced, multidisciplinary
training plan proposed in this application will provide our trainees with a rich set of skills, tools, and
experiences that will serve as excellent preparation for a successful career in infectious disease research."
10845560,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nearly all of the ~9 billion possible single nucleotide variants compatible with life exist among the 7.8 billion
individuals alive today. Understanding the effects of these variants, especially in disease-associated protein
coding genes, is central to understanding human biology and to using genome sequence information to guide
the diagnosis and treatment of disease. Unfortunately, most new variants revealed by genetic testing are
variants of uncertain significance, meaning insufficient information exists to definitively interpret the variant as
either pathogenic or benign. Variants of uncertain significance cannot be used to guide patient care and reflect
our incomplete understanding of variant effects. To overcome this challenge, we developed saturation genome
editing (SGE) and variant abundance by massively parallel sequencing (VAMP-seq), multiplexed assays of
variant effect that can make and measure the functional effect of massive numbers of variants. In SGE, single
nucleotide variants are edited directly into the genome, revealing the effect of these variants on cell survival
due to effects on splicing or protein function, thereby enabling accurate identification of both pathogenic and
benign variants. VAMP-seq measures the effects of missense variants on protein abundance inside cells, and
can identify up to 80% of pathogenic variants. Together, SGE and VAMP-seq can be applied to at least 40% of
genes to produce high quality, clinically useful functional data at single nucleotide resolution. Already, variant
functional data produced by each of these methods are being used by clinicians to interpret genetic variants.
Our proposed Center for Actionable Variant Analysis (CAVA) will harness SGE and VAMP-seq to
contribute single nucleotide variant functional data for ~200,000 variants in ~32 of the most clinically
impactful protein coding genes to the IGVF Variant/Element/Phenotype Catalog. To accomplish this
transformative goal we propose four Aims. In Aim 1, we will choose target genes and assays using a
framework that maximizes clinical need, clinical impact and practicality. Each target/assay pair will be
rigorously validated prior to entering production. We will contribute to the Consortium during the first year and
beyond by developing standards, sharing reagents and initiating collaborative projects. In Aim 2, SGE and
VAMP-seq will be performed on ~32 genes to high quality standards tracked using well-defined metrics. These
include assay dynamic range and reproducibility, individual measurement error, and concordance with existing
functional data and gold standard clinical data. A data analysis pipeline, integrated with our LIMS, will ensure
reproducibility and enable careful progress tracking. In Aim 3, we will share the multiplexed variant functional
data. Rigorously defined data sharing standards and metadata will ensure discoverability, computability and
durability. We will work with the Consortium to achieve consensus and we will revise our plans accordingly. In
Aim 4, we will enable labs to quickly stand up SGE or VAMP-seq. We will create a predict-evaluate-revise cycle
that leverages the data we will generate and work collaboratively to generate data to improve modeling efforts."

Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD) is the most common inherited cause of renal failure worldwide. The genes
responsible for the most frequent forms of PKD (PKD1, PKD2 and PKHD1) were identified over the past two
decades. Progress over these years has led to improved tools for studying cyst formation and progression and
these in turn have resulted in an improved understanding of PKD pathophysiology and, most recently, an
approved therapy. Despite these advances, however, there is no intervention to halt cystic kidney disease or
its systemic manifestations and there remains a pressing need for more effective treatments. In order to
promote interdisciplinary and integrated approaches to the identification of novel therapeutic targets, an RFA
has been issued to support PKD Research and Translation Core Centers (RTCCs) whose mission will be to
develop innovative research tools. Here we establish a new National Coordinating Center (NCC) to provide
highly organized administrative support to the RTCCs. We will implement a bold, innovative and outward-
facing program that will facilitate collaboration and cohesion between the RTCCs and establish mechanisms
for sharing of reagents and expertise broadly. The National Coordinating Center will seek to invigorate and
energize research in PKD by supporting and expanding the community of PKD investigators, by promoting
data driven science and by developing educational activities that encourage open and critical thinking and
attract the brightest new talent to the study of PKD. Leadership of the National Coordinating Center will be
provided by two investigators with an in-depth understanding of the PKD field and a deep belief in the
importance of collaborative science. The NCC will support the goals of the PKD Research Consortium with the
following Aims: 1) Convene the PKD Research Consortium Steering Committee to develop the program’s
overall direction, to organize and execute program activities and to assist with broad dissemination of
information 2) Develop a multipronged communication plan including an accessible web site for disseminating
information about research resources 3) Facilitate collaboration between RTCCs by establishing a framework
for joint development of resources 4) Facilitate broad sharing of resources across the consortium 5) Develop
an educational program, including an annual scientific symposium that will encourage constructive discourse
and diverse and creative approaches to PKD science. 6) Develop, support and execute a pilot and feasibility
program that encourages new investigators (both early stage and established) to enter the field of PKD
research. 7) Provide educational programming geared toward early stage investigators to foster the
development of a new cohort of PKD researchers and leaders. In summary, the collaborative environment
fostered by the NCC will catalyze advances that we expect will result in new insights into PKD pathobiology
and new therapeutic options for patients with polycystic kidney disease."

Alcohol is the most commonly used and abused drug among youth in the US; prevalence of alcohol use is
disproportionately higher among sexual minority youth (SMY) than among their heterosexual peers, especially
among those at the intersections of multiple marginalized identities. Alcohol use and abuse are associated with
a multiplicity of short and long-term negative health outcomes, including HIV vulnerabilities, alcohol and other
substance use dependence, neurocognitive deficiencies, and psychological distress. Despite the fact that
alcohol use and abuse during adolescence has important consequences for downstream health outcomes and
adult patterns of substance use, the majority of research among sexual minorities to date has focused on
college-aged populations. This gap in research with SMY is critical to rectify, particularly for SMY who
experience multiple, intersecting forms of marginalization based on sex, race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation.
Building on our team’s prior work in this area, we propose to use pooled data from the Local Youth Risk
Behavior Survey (YRBS), a national biennial survey of high school students that assesses sexual identity and
behavior, as well as health behaviors including alcohol use, HIV vulnerability, and mental health. Our uniquely
large dataset, which currently contains data from 2005 to 2019 (253 jurisdiction-years) and 950,295 high
school youth, will expand to include 2021, 2023, and 2025 data, resulting in an estimated 1,668,078 youth.
This will allow us to apply an array of complex epidemiologic approaches to assess the impact of alcohol use
on the sexual, mental, and physical health of SMY living in the US, and the disparities that exist between
multiply marginalized SMY and their peers. This proposal is a natural extension of our prior work (R01
AA024409) that resulted in numerous publications in high-impact peer-reviewed journals (e.g., Pediatrics,
American Journal of Public Health) and a diverse array of interdisciplinary collaborations. The current proposal
will continue these successes, incorporating an intersectional lens as well as additional advanced methods of
inquiry, including use of multilevel modeling to determine jurisdictional and temporal associations with alcohol
use and disparities in HIV risk; latent class analysis to describe alcohol use classes and their association with
minority status; and the impact of regional, school, and structural level factors that influence alcohol use and its
role in increased HIV vulnerability among diverse SMY. These approaches will allow us to continue identifying
critical pathways for intervention to ensure equitable health outcomes and minimize the risks associated with
alcohol use and abuse among notably vulnerable populations of youth."

Primary visual cortex (V1) is one of the most studied areas of the cerebral cortex, but we lack a theoretical
framework for a comprehensive understanding of V1 neurophysiology. Through the proposed research, we aim
to provide one. A class of circuit models, called Oscillatory Recurrent Gated Neural Integrator Circuits
(ORGaNICs), simulates many key neurophysiological phenomena. Our goal is to develop a theory for the full
range of neurophysiological phenomena in V1, i.e., a single predictive model with biophysically-realistic
parameters, and to test that theory with previously published datasets acquired with a wide range of
methodologies.
Preliminary results demonstrate predictions of the theory commensurate with experimental observations of V1
response dynamics (including onset transients and the stimulus-dependence of gamma oscillations), the
dynamics of attentional modulation, experimental evidence for recurrent amplification and inhibitory
stabilization, experimental observations about adaptation including tuning changes and decorrelation, noise
quenching, the dependence of noise correlations on similarity in orientation preference and attention, and
psychophysical contrast discrimination.
Aim 1 key contributions: 1) an analytical theory (i.e., closed-form expressions) that makes experimentally-
testable predictions about a wide range of phenomena related to the dynamics of V1 activity; 2) closed-form
expressions derived from the theory for LFP power spectra; 3) a novel explanation for oscillatory activity in
visual cortex.
Aim 2 key contributions: 1) an analytical theory of adaptation in V1 that makes experimentally-testable
predictions about a wide range of neurophysiological phenomena related to adaptation; 2) the demonstration
that adaptation maintains an efficient neural code, subject to finite resources (overall activity in the circuit),
despite dynamically changing stimulus statistics.
Aim 3 key contributions: 1) an analytical theory that makes experimentally-testable predictions about the
variability and covariability of neural responses; 2) experimentally-testable predictions about psychophysical
discrimination.
The proposed research has the potential to be transformative. We will provide a new set of analytical results
and computational tools for characterizing a broad range of neural circuit models, which will have a significant
impact on the analysis of experimental data and experimental design, and will make new experimentally-
testable predictions for both ORGaNICs and alternative models. We will provide a roadmap for understanding
the underlying circuit mechanisms (the cell types, their interconnections and biophysics), and how manipulating
those mechanisms may change circuit function to correct disorders of visual perception and attention."
10901970,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Stringent regulation of inflammation during infectious and non-infectious diseases is critical for limiting tissue
pathology while promoting disease resolution. The dead-box helicase family members known as retinoic acid-
inducible gene I-like receptors (RIG-I-like receptors, RLRs) play a critical role in recognizing self and non-self
nucleic acids in the cytosol of host cells. Dysregulation of RLRs and their downstream interferon (IFN) and
inflammatory signaling cascade can manifest as autoimmunity or as defects in antimicrobial responses. Despite
the critical importance of RLRs, the function of these receptors and their associated molecular pathways in
different cell types, remains an important gap in our understanding of tissue homeostasis versus diseased states.
As an independent investigator, my studies now focus on how emerging non-canonical functions of RLRs and
IFN regulate inflammation in the context of pulmonary pathogenesis and immune cell programming, two critical
areas in which better understanding of RLR-associated signaling could lead to new strategies for treating
infectious and non-infectious inflammatory diseases. Our preliminary studies have found that atypical induction
of the RLR RIG-I using a synthetic agonist leads to activation of immune cell programming genes rather than
IFN induction. Moreover, we have identified new roles for type III IFN (IFN) in pulmonary tissue repair following
pathogen-induced damage. My research program can be defined with three thematic goals: 1) elucidate how
RLRs and IFN pathways contribute to tissue homeostasis, 2) determine whether RLR and IFN pathways are
differentially activated in a strategically-selected set of cell types in damaged vs adjacent tissues, and 3)
determine the distinct contributions of RLR and IFN in controlling non-infectious or infection-mediated
inflammation and resolution. We have developed first-of-their-kind mouse models to eliminate expression of the
RLRs RIG-I, MDA5, and their downstream signaling adapter MAVS, as well as type I and type III IFN signaling
pathways in temporal and cell-specific fashions. These tools will allow us to use cutting edge high-parameter
spectral cytometry, along with spatial transcriptomics, to define the most relevant inflammatory pathways
deployed by individual cell types in the context of their natural tissue microenvironment. Ultimately, our studies
will improve understanding of cell-intrinsic regulation of nucleic acid sensing pathways, and will provide strategies
for differentially targeting each pathway to maximize therapeutic benefit while minimizing adverse side effects."

The mission of our multi-institutional MSTP, comprised of The University of Texas Health Science
Center at Houston (UTHealth Houston), The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center
(MDACC), and in conjunction with The University of Puerto Rico Medical Sciences Campus
School of Medicine (UPR), is to pursue novel training of a diverse group of intellectually gifted
students for careers as physician-scientists focused on disease-oriented research and bridging
the knowledge gap between medicine and basic science. The MSTP has been continuously
funded since 1982 and has graduated 136 students. To expand diversity in our physician-scientist
trainees, we have partnered with the UPR, leveraging a NIH-funded MDACC/UPR U54
Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research award to integrate into our MSTP those talented
UPR medical students who want to pursue research careers, and approximately 34% of our
program is underrepresented minorities (URM). Applications to our program from students from
across the country have doubled over the past 10 years, allowing us to matriculate a group of
highly qualified students (50 students currently in the program). To prepare physician-scientists
to pursue disease-oriented research, a novel educational sequence was established to integrate
the medical and graduate school. Although students begin to fulfill graduate school requirements
from the very beginning of the program, they complete the clinical specialty rotations before
pursuing dissertation research. Students can select from 9 graduate training programs in
biomedical sciences. Support for this educational sequence is provided by the fact that, in the
past 10 years, attrition from the program has been less than 4% and the time to completion is 7.8
years. Our students get extensive training in ethics of research and in rigor and reproducibility as
well as how to work in a safe research environment. The quality of students and the program are
exemplified by strong publication records and excellent residency matches. A major element to
enhance training is the required Topics in Molecular Medicine course, which provides vertical
integration and community for the students, exposure to the breadth and depth of research at the
institutions, and insights into career development and leadership. Based on graduates over the
past 15 years, the majority of our graduates who are out of training stayed in research-related
careers (71%; academia, FDA, Biotech; n = 30). MSTP support is requested for a total of 6
matriculating students per year to expand the number of students in this unique and diverse
training program."
10880692,"Title: Investigating the molecular mechanisms of glycosaminoglycan assembly
Project Summary
The long-term goal of this research program is to elucidate and understand the regulatory mechanisms involved
in the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in mammalian cells. GAGs are long, linear polysaccharides
that are expressed on all animal cells and play a key role in many cellular processes, including cell signaling and
development. These complex carbohydrates are typically attached to core proteins, known as proteoglycans,
located on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix, and the chains are composed of alternating
glucosamine and uronic acid sugar residues that are heterogeneously N- and O-sulfated. The biosynthesis of
GAGs is a non-templated process, driven by the concerted activity of a large family of enzymes localized to the
Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum. The arrangement and orientation of the sulfated sugar residues specify the
location of distinct ligand binding sites on the cell surface, and these modifications can vary temporally during
development and spatially across tissues. The capacity of GAGs to bind ligands impacts the fundamental
properties of cells, the ability to form tissues and organs, and normal physiology. Despite the key functions of
these molecules, there is a significant gap in knowledge regarding the regulatory mechanisms that give rise to
their variable composition and binding properties. Through a multidisciplinary research program that leverages
strengths in functional genomics, cell biology, and glycobiology, we aim to identify and characterize the
mechanisms involved in controlling the inherent diversity of GAG structure and function in cells. Of particular
interest, is the role of chromatin remodeling complexes in regulating GAG assembly during development and in
disease states, as we recently identified members of the polycomb repressive complex (PRC) as novel
epigenetic modifiers of GAG enzyme expression and assembly. We hypothesize that defined epigenetic and
transcriptional programs tune the expression of biosynthetic enzymes in distinct cell types, which modulates their
interaction with a plethora of growth factors and other binding partners in the extracellular matrix. We also aim
to investigate how the core biosynthetic machinery is regulated in situ in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi.
We plan to explore the physical association of the biosynthetic enzymes and core proteoglycans in the ER and
Golgi and identify unknown chaperone and/or scaffolding proteins that may tune glycosylation in the secretory
pathway. To carry out this work, we will leverage our historic strengths in the analysis of GAG structure, function,
and regulation to understand: (1) how transcription factors and chromatin remodeling complexes control the
expression of GAG biosynthetic enzymes, which impacts GAG structure and function, (2) how protein-protein
interactions in the ER and Golgi orchestrate proteoglycan assembly in distinct cell types, and (3) how
proteoglycan core proteins act as scaffolds for GAG assembly. Overall, we expect this endeavor to significantly
advance our knowledge regarding the regulatory mechanisms controlling glycosylation and offer new strategies
and targets to manipulate GAG biogenesis in human disease."

Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), such as heparan sulfate (HS), are important components of the extracellular
matrix of all cells. The extraordinary structural diversity of GAGs enables them to interact with a wide variety of
biological molecules, but primarily proteins, to modulate biological processes, such as cell adhesion, tissue
repair, coagulation, and immune response, among many others. Additionally, a number of different viruses,
including HIV-1, initiate infection of cells by binding to cell surface GAGs. Unfortunately, the diversity of
potential binding motifs in GAG sequences has made identification of relevant sequences challenging. In
particular, heparan sulfate (HS) is the most structurally diverse, with sixteen unique disaccharide configurations
and 256 unique tetrasaccharide configurations. Significant progress has been made in recent years developing
libraries of synthetic HS oligomers, allowing for detailed experimental structural studies of HS-protein
complexes. Understanding the structural basis of these interactions is key to drug development and the HS
binding protein-HS (HSBP-HS) interaction studies to date have been either non-structural or computational.
The overall goal of this project is to utilize these recently developed synthetic HS libraries and NMR-based
structural models to identify key interactions. HIV-1 p17 will be used for initial studies because it is very
important in many stages of the life cycle of HIV-1. Heparan sulfate receptors are known to influence growth
factor signaling, cell adhesion, and enzymatic catalysis on human cells. Thus, this interaction may be one of
the deciding factors for disease progression in humans infected with HIV-1. In Aim 1, a library of synthetic HS
tetrasaccharides will be screened for binding to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) p17 protein to
identify the sequence-specific HS characteristics of the preferred binding oligomers. In Aim 2, the HSBP-HS
complexes of both strong and weak binding sequences will be studied via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
to model the structure of the complex and identify key interactions for future drug development. After the
methodology is established, HS-binding chemokines will be screened in Aim 3 to identify suitable targets for
future NMR studies."
10886037,"7. Project Summary/Abstract
 The adaptation of abiotic transition metal catalysts for applications in biological systems has undergone
remarkable growth in recent years with examples ranging from artificial metalloenzymes to molecular
probes for detection of challenging analytes such as carbon monoxide. The PI has a standing interest in
discovery, development, and understanding of strategies for detecting challenging biologically relevant
molecules via the unique reactivity of transition metals. Most recently, the Michel group reported BODIPY
Ethylene Probes (BEPs) as the first profluorescent Activity Based Sensors (ABS) for the detection of
ethylene in biological systems. These ABS adapted well-known ruthenium olefin metathesis catalyst, which
are known to readily react with ethylene.
 While ethylene has long been known as an important plant hormone it has also been demonstrated to
be produced in mammals as a result of oxidative stress that is hallmark to numerous diseases. In particular
ethylene arises from the radical fragmentation of lipid peroxides and/or intermediates in their formation.
The formation of lipid peroxides is a result of reactive oxygen species, which are implicated as playing
stress or signaling roles in numerous diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and
neurodegenerative diseases amongst others. While there are some sophisticated spectroscopic methods
for sensitively measuring the biomarker ethylene in exhaled breath, these approaches are necessarily
limited in spatial resolution and complexity of sample. Since reporting our initial ABS approach, our group
has conducted systematic ligand modulation studies to improve probe response time and sensitivity.
Through this work the limit-of-detection was improved nearly two orders of magnitude. Despite these
advancements, important questions remain for broad applications in the detection of endogenous ethylene
related to modifications that further improve sensitivity while retaining robust stability in biological systems.
 The next stage of developing this technology will build on mechanistic insight and recent advancements
in catalytic olefin metathesis. This will be accomplished through an interdisciplinary approach of synthesis,
analytical and photophysical characterization, and subcellular localization studies. It is anticipated that the
proposed research will result in highly sensitive ethylene ABS localized to subcellular locations where
ethylene is expected to be found in the highest concentrations. Further we expect to explore novel
strategies for ethylene detection beyond the dosimetric responses generally employed for ethylene and
other small molecule analytes. As has been the case over the past 10-15 years, we envision that there will
be continued growth of transition metal catalysts operating in cellular environments to perform critical
functions that would otherwise not be possible. The research and concepts of the proposed program will
continue to significantly contribute to this field.

A diverse biomedical workforce is essential to ensure representation, creativity, and innovation in the field of
biomedical research and higher education. While minoritized students begin college as STEM majors at the
same rates as their well represented counterparts, they are less likely to graduate with a STEM degree. The
attrition of students from STEM majors is acutely seen in students who begin college at two-year institutions,
warranting increased support for transfer students. This training grant supports students as they transfer from
Baltimore City Community College (BCCC) and the Community College of Baltimore County (CCBC) to Towson
University and complete their bachelor’s degree in the biomedical sciences. This new training grant proposal
builds on the past success of our twenty years long R25 B2B and implements new strategies to empower and
support trainees as we transition to a T34 mechanism. Our program is designed to meet the following objectives:
1) Provide a dynamic and supportive training environment that promotes self-efficacy and science identity. We
aim for >85% of trainees to transfer to TU and for >90% of trainees who transfer to TU to graduate within
three years of transfer; 2) Cultivate a supportive and inclusive community that is integrated with active STEM
training programs at BCCC, CCBC and TU to provide professional development. All B2B trainees will
participate in professional development activities that expose trainees to biomedical career options and
promote career development skills; 3) Provide B2B trainees with the information and tools required to
successfully matriculate into post-graduate programs in the biomedical sciences. While the primary goal of the
B2B program is to support the transfer of and completion of bachelor’s degrees in biomedical fields, all B2B
trainees will receive mentoring that informs them of post-graduate opportunities in the biomedical field and
facilitates development of application materials for post-graduate study. We aim for at least 50% of trainees
to apply to post-graduate programs in the biomedical field within two years of completion of their
bachelor’s degree; and 4) Evaluate the effectiveness of B2B training components through annual program
evaluation and improved tracking of B2B alumni. We aim for tracking of >90% of B2B trainees for at least
fifteen years following admission into the B2B program."

A key Healthy People 2030 Tobacco-Use Objective is to eliminate state preemption of local tobacco control.
However, little published research has rigorously quantified the impacts of state preemption of local tobacco
control, particularly: 1) across states and over time; 2) across a broad range of tobacco control efforts (e.g.,
restrictions on advertising, youth access); 3) across a range of key outcomes (e.g., youth and adult tobacco
use, secondhand smoke exposure [SHSe], tobacco retail); and 4) with regard to potential disproportionate
impacts among certain subgroups that face tobacco-related disparities (e.g., racial/ethnic minorities, lower
socioeconomic status [SES], those in rural settings). As initial evidence providing a basis for this proposal, our
RWJF-funded research concluded that state smoke-free air preemption was associated with an increase in
adult smoking prevalence and affect counties differently. This proposal will build on this work and advance the
literature by filling the aforementioned gaps in the existing research. The long-term goal of this research is to
inform policies to reduce tobacco use and related health disparities, as well as to inform policy efforts more
broadly, particularly as public health issues, like firearm safety, nutrition policies, and COVID-19 mitigation
measures, are increasingly subject to state preemption. Our objective is to advance our understanding of
whether—and to what extent—enactment or repeal of state preemption on local tobacco control is associated
with disparities in tobacco use, SHSe, and retail (sales, retailer density). Our central hypothesis is that state
preemption results in disproportionately high tobacco use, SHSe, and retail in communities with greater
racial/ethnic minorities, of lower SES, and/or in rural settings. Our rationale is that, by preempting local
tobacco control, state governments deprive localities of a crucial tool for reducing the burden of tobacco in their
communities, potentially widening disparities. We will analyze national data from 1999 to 2021 to examine the
impacts of enactment or repeal of state preemption of 5 state tobacco preemption (i.e., smoke-free policy,
advertising, licensure, youth access, and taxation). Our specific aims are to examine state preemption on
tobacco control in relation to changes in: 1) individual-level tobacco use (including e-cigs) in adolescents and
adults and nonsmokers' SHSe, and potential disproportionate impacts among certain subgroups of individuals;
and 2) sales of tobacco products and tobacco retail density over time, and potential disproportionate impacts
among communities representing those facing tobacco-related disparities. We will employ multilevel models
and crosswalk/merge (state/local laws, outcomes, sociodemographics) data from various sources at different
geographic levels. This study will have high impact, as it will: 1) add to the evidence base regarding state
preemption impact on population outcomes and mechanisms of impact; 2) inform efforts to reduce tobacco use
and related disparities; and 3) engage key tobacco control and policy experts in research dissemination."

Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare disorder with devastating consequences for the young women
diagnosed with this disease. We observed occult expression of the glycoprotein gp100 and other melanoma
associated antigens in nodular, pulmonary tumor lesions. LAM cells carry a dysfunctional TSC complex and
exhibit constitutive mTOR activation. Though rapamycin can provide relief, there is a great need to develop a
true cure for women with LAM. We evaluated the expression of suitable antigens and the associated infiltration
by immune cells. Here we propose to capitalize on the occult expression of melanoma associated antigens to
develop safe and effective, T cell-based immunotherapy for LAM. First, we will generate constructs targeting
LAM antigens to transduce T cells and prepare the cells for adoptive transfer. These constructs are equipped or
not with a homing receptor to drive the adoptively transferred T cells to LAM lung, exploiting the consistent
overexpression of the chemokine ligand CCL2 within affected tissues., in order to minimize off tumor effects.
Transgenic T cells are generated with stem cell-like attributes to promote longevity and continued functionality.
Efficacy and safety comparisons are made between TCR transgenic and HLA-independent CAR T cells targeting
a LAM surface antigen. Based on expression of a natural receptor epitope encoded by the construct, resulting T
cells are readily sorted and traced, and will be put to the test in mouse models of the disease. We will engage
an immunocompetent disease model, as well as PDX implanted mice to explore the treatment potential of
adoptively transferred, LAM reactive T cells. Within PDX mice, the LAM microenvironment is well conserved.
Expression of LAM tumor antigens can be maintained over time, while therapeutics can be tested in a statistically
and biologically meaningful way. Finally, we will explore the immune microenvironment in LAM and in PDX
tissues exposed to adoptive transfer or not, to learn whether T cells harbored by LAM lung or supplied by
adoptive transfer can be taught to clear existing lesions. Next, our collaborative group aims to develop a winning
immunotherapeutic approach to treat the devastating disease. The project will thus cover (1) generating and in
vitro testing of transgenic mouse and human T cells; and (2) measuring the anti-tumor efficacy of adoptively
transferred T cells in immune competent as well as PDX models of LAM as well as (1) in-depth analysis of the
immune environment encountered in LAM lesions before and after adoptive transfer. Resulting preclinical data
can then serve to design a clinical trial in follow-up studies and test the hypothesis, that benign tumors in LAM
are amenable to treatment by adoptive transfer of tissue homing, LAM reactive T cells."

The Emergency Department (ED) is a central pillar of the health care system. ED physicians and
nurses are exposed to high work-related stressors in addition to disruptive day-night shifts. The well-
being of the 150,000 ED clinicians in the U.S. is important for public health with significant
downstream effects on the well-being of the 145 million patients that are served every year. Of the 1
million U.S. physicians, 45% are reporting burnout symptoms and the number increases to 70% in
ED physicians and up to 82% in ED nurses. Clinician burnout is associated with increased risk for
cardiovascular diseases, mortality, medical errors, but also stress-mediated physiological alterations
and cognitive decline. Yet, the knowledge about the long-term development of burnout is limited. To
effectively intervene, the timely identification of ED clinicians at risk for burnout is a critical
prerequisite. This study proposes an innovative approach using digital phenotyping to discover and
test Digital Biomarkers as predictors of burnout symptoms and cognitive function.
 This proposed prospective longitudinal study will chart cognitive functioning and burnout
symptom trajectories in a cohort of 350 ED clinicians to inform when, where, and how to intervene.
We will use advanced computational methods to extract objective markers for burnout and cognitive
decline from video and audio data. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that voice and
speech content, head movement, pupil dilation, gaze, and facial landmark features of emotion
provide probabilistic information that will allow us to identify digital biomarkers for burnout and
cognitive function.
 We will test the relevance of the discovered digital biomarkers and determine their discriminatory
accuracy to distinguish between risk for clinically relevant vs. non-relevant burnout symptoms. We
examine the association of digital biomarkers with physiological markers of chronic stress (i.e., hair
cortisol concentration). We will also assess the association of digital biomarkers with the long-term
job-related stress load of individual ED clinicians such as high ED crowding, patient acuity level, ED
staffing, sleep, and shift schedules. This research program aims to deliver an objective, accurate,
and reliable digital measure for clinician well-being. Such digital biomarkers will enable more efficient
ED clinician self-management and will promote low-threshold prevention strategies. The mental and
physical well-being of ED clinicians is of high value to those who work day in and day out to save the
lives of others and is the foundation of a well-functioning, high-quality emergency care system."
10914156,"Asthma and sleep disordered breathing (SDB) are common chronic diseases that
disproportionately affect Black children and those living in poor neighborhoods. Household
environmental exposures have been shown to increase asthma morbidity and there is strong
biologic rationale that these will impact sleep quality, but to date, there have been limited studies
of the indoor environment and sleep. Our overarching goal is to define home environmental
determinants of sleep disparities and the contribution of sleep disparities to childhood asthma
morbidity among low-income, predominantly Black children living in Baltimore City. The home
environment is critical as children spend the majority of their time indoors, most in their own home
and ~1/3 in the bedroom, the environment most relevant for sleep. We propose to
comprehensively study the bedroom environment, including air quality, allergens, microbes, and
the relationship with sleep quality in children with asthma. Our prior studies have shown that
children in Baltimore City live in homes where bedroom levels of air pollution are three times the
concentrations recommend by the World Health Organization Indoor Air Quality standards and
that mouse allergen, present in high concentrations, is a driver of asthma morbidity in Baltimore.
Bedroom dust and nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus are prevalent, and emerging
evidence suggests bedroom exposure to this bacteria and its toxic protein products are
associated with nocturnal asthma. There is biological plausibility that the bedroom environmental
exposures increase inflammation and oxidative stress responses in the upper airway that
contribute to risk for and severity of SDB. While there is emerging evidence that environmental
exposures impact sleep, there is a need for studies with objective assessments in children. Our
research team has extensive experience in the conduct of home environmental monitoring and
simultaneously assessing health outcomes in children. In the proposed project, we aim to
determine the association between a) bedroom environmental exposures (air quality, allergens,
microbes) and sleep quality among children with asthma in Baltimore City 2) bedroom
environmental exposures and upper airway inflammation/oxidative stress 3) sleep quality and
asthma morbidity among children with asthma in Baltimore City. This comprehensive study of
bedroom environment and sleep among inner-city African American children has the potential to
provide foundational evidence for environmental drivers of poor sleep quality that are needed to
design interventions to reduce sleep and asthma health disparities."

Pregnancy loss (PL) occurs in approximately 15% of clinically recognized pregnancies and only 30% of
conceptions result in a live birth, yet little is known about genomic predictors of PL beyond large chromosomal
aberrations. While it is likely that non-genetic etiologies and common variants underlie a component of PLs, we
propose here to disentangle the mutational spectrum of rare and de novo variation contributing to non-viability.
We overcome traditional barriers to genomic studies of PL, namely insufficient power, low-resolution
technologies, and reductive statistical approaches, by establishing a Fetal Genomics Consortium (FGC)
comprised of 21 international sites. Our team includes leading expertise in maternal-fetal medicine, statistical
genetics, genomics, technology and algorithm development, structural variation, and in vivo CRISPR modeling.
We will apply high-throughput genome sequencing (WGS) at the Broad Institute and external datasets as a
frontline strategy and perform analyses of at least 2,500 PL trios. Our cohort will include the PL continuum,
including at least 2,000 fetal demise trios from 20-42 weeks gestation and 500 recurrent pregnancy loss trios in
couples with at least two previous losses at any gestational age. We will combine, process, analyze, and interpret
pathogenic variation and return clinically relevant results to families, while prioritizing a subset of unsolved cases
with complex fetal anomalies for long-read WGS and de novo assembly (AIM 1). We will then explore novel
genomic predictors of PL and compare the genomic architectures of the developmental continuum from early PL
to later onset developmental disorders (AIM 2). These studies will apply novel analytic methods to integrate all
classes of genomic variation, mutation rates, relative risk estimates and measures of evolutionary constraint for
each gene in the genome to interrogate the ‘intolerome’. To improve discovery power in PL, we will leverage
massive population-scale datasets (>2M genomes), and the aggregation of >200,000 cases from ongoing
developmental disorder studies. These cohorts are accessible and already being analyzed by our FGC groups,
including the Broad Institute Center for Mendelian Genetics, Gabriella Miller Kids First sequencing center,
gnomAD, All of US, the Undiagnosed Disease Network, and autism and neurodevelopmental disorder consortia
studies. AIM 2 will integrate computational models of coding and noncoding constraint into a statistical framework
to identify novel genes and loci associated with PL, and prioritize variants for in vivo CRISPR lethality screening
in mouse embryos (AIM 3). This FGC proposal is thus poised to transform our understanding of the genomic
predictors of PL. We will evaluate meticulously phenotyped PL families with emerging technologies, population-
scale datasets and developmental disorder cohorts using uniform bioinformatic and statistical approaches. Our
analyses will deliver clinically meaningful results to current families, and our functional modeling will inform
interpretation of variation incompatible with human development for future PL families."

The efforts described in this second phase CoBRE application will support the Center of Excellence within
the West Virginia University Health Sciences Center (WVU HSC) that focuses on studies of the tumor
microenvironment (TME), designated the TME CoBRE. The overarching critical need for continued emphasis
in this area is driven, in part, by that fact that cancer mortality is a significant health disparity in the
Appalachian region, specifically in West Virginia. We are building on a successful Phase I, where we had two
graduates with R01s, a major national foundation grant, a NSF grant, an R21 and our cores were awarded
two S10 awards. In total we had 11 Project Leader (PL) awards as PI, and 8 as a Co-I. The Center has grown
to over 20 faculty, including a number of faculty who are potential PLs, with their teams publishing over 140
papers since initiation of Phase I. Laboratories supported, in part, by the Phase I TME CoBRE, have engaged
in the training of ~60 students further amplifying the impact of the NIGMS investment on workforce
development in parallel to CoBRE PL success. Herein, we provide details for the strategy to continue to
develop careers of promising junior scientists and recruit additional investigators to study the biology of, and
novel therapeutic approaches that will benefit from, a mechanistic understanding of the diverse TME. The
five highly translational projects in Phase II focus on the microenvironment of different tumor types, including
cancers initiating in the bone marrow, gastric system, breast, and brain. The administrative core will manage
the overall budget and provide assistance in annual reporting and submission of extramural applications of
all CoBRE Project Leaders. In addition, this core will provide oversight of mentoring, which includes two
primary advisors for each investigator as well as an external advisor, and a network of previous CoBRE
graduates and the Director of Core Resources. The investigators will be supported by two research cores
that leverage past and current CoBRE and IDeA support. Single cell analysis capability in the existing flow
cytometry core will aid to it investigations into genomics of single cells. The Imaging Core will support PLs
with cutting edge technologies including microbeam irradiation, microCT, pre-clinical MRI, and real time
microenvironment imaging of pO2 and pH. Lastly, we will continue to administer a pilot project program to
recruit new junior faculty to the TME CoBRE, as we saw five of six pilot grant awardees eventually become

ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY
The Career Enhancement Core (CEC) of this U54 Application proposes an integrated set of educational and
research support activities to foster development of research at UCLA in women's health and sex as a
biological factor in disease (WH/SABV), especially related to sex differences in the metabolic syndrome. The
project will support a pilot and feasibility grant program, to provide seed funding each year to novel research
projects that investigate WH/SABV, attracting new junior and established investigators to this area and
fostering their professional development. The CEC will support novel educational programs at UCLA, aimed at
every level of the university, especially undergraduates, but also including doctoral students, residents and
fellows, and young and established faculty. A new program is proposed “Introduction to SABV Research
Concepts and Methods” to develop early-stage undergraduates and recruit them to SABV research. A core
advanced undergraduate course will be taught, “Sex Differences in Physiology and Disease”. New lectures on
diverse topics related to SABV will be videotaped and streamed from the online UCLA SABV Video Library, to
enhance education on SABV internationally. CEC faculty will consult extensively one-on-one with established
investigators who are learning best practices for embarking on research in SABV in animal models of disease."
10932166,"ABSTRACT – OVERALL
Gastric cancer is a leading cause of cancer morbidity and mortality worldwide. The bacterium Helicobacter pylori
(Hp) is the single greatest risk factor for gastric cancer, its infection triggering an inflammatory cascade within
the gastric microenvironment. Many people infected with Hp develop a precancerous lesion called gastric
intestinal metaplasia (GIM), and while some are minimally affected by the condition, others go on to develop
invasive gastric cancer. There remain many unanswered questions about how Hp interacts with the gastric
microenvironment and promotes gastric cancer, and why GIM poses variable risk to patients. The focus of this
Program Project Grant (PPG) is characterizing the molecular and genomic features of gastric epithelial cells in
high-risk versus low-risk gastric precancerous lesions, with Hp as a stratifying risk factor. The PPG involves three
distinct yet synergistic projects:
 (1) Molecular and Cellular Determinant of High-Risk Gastric Precancerous Lesions.
 (2) Ex Vivo Modeling of Gastric Precancerous Lesions.
 (3) Molecular Risk Stratification of Gastric Precancerous Lesions.
The leaders of the PPG’s multidisciplinary research teams have backgrounds in the relevant clinical specialties
of infectious disease, gastroenterology and gastrointestinal oncology. The PPG leverages broad and deep
research expertise in single-cell sequencing, Hp biology, epidemiology and clinical research for gastric cancer
prevention. There are several robust and synergistic clinical cohorts and biospecimen repositories that make up
the foundation of the PPG. These include two cohorts of gastric precancerous lesions, the Gastric Precancerous
Conditions Study (GAPS, Stanford University) and the NCI-supported Gastric Cancer Precursor Lesions Study
(GPCL, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile), the Gastric Cancer Registry (GCR, Stanford University), and
the NCI-supported Hp Genome Project (HpGP, Vanderbilt University). The translational and clinical projects in
the PPG offer a novel strategy of high-impact precision interception and cancer prevention to reduce gastric
cancer risk. The interdisciplinary approach in this PPG is essential for improving clinical prevention strategies
and risk attenuation of gastric cancer."
10817745,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Over the last two decades, a growing literature has demonstrated that social factors drive both drug use and
infectious diseases such as HIV. Simultaneously, epidemic modeling has become vital for reducing the spread
of HIV, as it allows insight into mechanisms of spread, forecasts future incidence, and provides guidance on
effective intervention strategies. However, despite all their power and complexity, these epidemic models still
often lack realistic social data, as network and contextual data reflective of the most at-risk populations are
often deemed too methodologically challenging to capture. In line with the urgent need for data capture tools
which enable researchers to understand the social context around the most at-risk populations, our
interdisciplinary team has developed a free, open-source, NIH BD2K-funded software suite called Network
Canvas (R01DA042711). While Network Canvas has already substantially improved the ability of researchers
to quickly and accurately capture complex network and contextual data, to be useful for HIV elimination, our
existing tool requires optimization to further improve its timely and broad reach to the most at-risk populations,
as well as enhancements that will modernize the tool to better meet the needs of epidemic modelers. In
particular, we must transition Network Canvas to a Hybrid Cloud Model, developing a cloud-based software
platform that will enhance the ability of researchers to robustly capture data remotely and at scale, as well as
reach the most essential but hard-to-reach populations. Additionally, we propose user-engagement and
evaluation activities to inform the software's design and rigorously evaluate its value and impact on the
measurement of networks relevant to epidemic modeling and HIV. Through the work proposed within the
current project, we aim to: 1) Enhance data reproducibility, timeliness, and measurement for researchers; 2)
Enhance the availability and accessibility for study participants; 3) Rigorously evaluate the tool's impact on the
measurement of sexual and drug networks. This work will result in both an enhanced free and open-source
tool and an increased scientific understanding of the value and impact of the tool for capturing crucial data
relevant to HIV and drug use. Finally, just as we have done over the last five-year period, this project will
employ a strong plan for user engagement where we build partnerships with and actively employ iterative
feedback from relevant research communities to shape software features and functionality. Feedback would
be sought widely - from our highly accomplished Scientific Advisory Board (SAB); from our collaborative pilot
partnerships with researchers who hold strong NIH-funded drug use, HIV, and epidemic modeling research
portfolios; and from at-risk populations themselves. This development approach is key in ensuring community
buy-in, accelerated adoption, and long-term sustainability of our tools."
10931415,"Microenvironmental pH is a key factor in cell functioning and pathogenesis. To control the function and behavior
of cells by modulating pH microenvironments is critical to advancing the development of cell biology and tissue
engineering and enabling applications in drug delivery and regenerative medicine. However, pH-based cell
control remains a challenge due to the lack of means to real-time, spatioselective modulation of
microenvironmental pH. While pH microenvironments in cell systems are highly heterogeneous in time and
space, known pH-modulation methods are through CO2/HCO3− buffering and H+ diffusion, which are slow,
isotropic, and nonspecific. An urgent need, therefore, is to modulate pH microenvironments in a spatiotemporally
specific manner. Failure to do so means that pH, an essential factor that determines cell fate and function, is not
in good control. The PI’s long-term goal is microenvironmental pH–based closed-loop regulation of cell function,
metabolism, and morphogenesis. The overall goal of this project, a critical step towards the long-term goal, is to
control cells by real-time, spatioselective modulation of pH microenvironments. The hypothesis is that cell
function and behavior can be regulated with ultra-high spatiotemporal resolutions (10–100 µm, <50 s), compared
to conventional, diffusion-based methods (>103 µm, >103 s), in pH microenvironments that are modulated
nanoelectrochemically by microelectrodes based on graphene, a two-dimensional nanomaterial with unique
outstanding bio-transduction properties that address the primary challenge of on-chip pH modulation of living
cell systems for typical microelectrode materials. The approach to test this hypothesis is to quantify real-time
responses of model cell systems to arrayed pH microenvironment generated by an array of bidirectional
graphene-microelectrode transducers that are optically transparent to allow microscopic characterization and
communicate with cellular systems through electrical signal interrogation and rapid nanoelectrochemical
microenvironmental-pH modulation. The following milestone goals will be reached in this project: (1) to create
densely arrayed pH microenvironment by developing an array of bidirectional graphene-microelectrode
transducers and (2) to control the function and behavior of model cell systems (cardiomyocytes and tumor cells)
via spatiotemporal microenvironmental pH modulation using the graphene transducer array. The PI is uniquely
positioned to conduct the project due to the ability of the PI’s lab to create graphene microelectrodes integrable
in a fluidic device for interfacing cellular systems, interrogating electrical/chemical cell signals, and controlling
cell behavior by generating microscale pH gradients. To harness and combine these techniques allows the
development of arrays of bidirectional graphene transducers for selective, real-time pH-microenvironment
modulation and cell control. The expected outcome of the project is pH-based cell-control tools with over two-
orders-of-magnitude enhanced spatiotemporal resolutions compared to conventional methods. This outcome is
to generate positive impact on bioengineering development, regenerative medicine, and synthetic morphology."
10932188,"Project Summary
The overall aim of the research is Shukla group is to develop computational methods that facilitate investigation of rare
conformational transitions in proteins and help guide the design of experiments to validate the in silico predictions. In par-
ticular, we apply these computational methods to investigate functional regulation of membrane proteins such as membrane
transporters and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Here, we propose development of transfer learning based methods
to predict the effect of mutations on protein function and apply these methods to investigate monoamine transporters, sugar
transporters and Class C GPCRs.
Deep mutagenesis, whereby tens of thousands of mutational effects are determined by combining in vitro selections of
sequence variants with Illumina sequencing, is an emerging technology for indirectly interrogating and observing protein
conformations in living cells; the solving of an integrative structure of a neuronal class C G protein-coupled receptor in
an active conformation by deep mutagenesis-guided modeling is one prominent example of this approach's success. Using
deep mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulations to inform each other, we plan to determine the mechanism of ion-
coupled neurotransmitter import by monoamine transporters at atomic resolution. Fluorescent substrates have enabled us to
use ﬂuorescence-based sorting of libraries of transporter mutants to ﬁnd mutations along the entire permeation pathway
that increase or decrease substrate import. These comprehensive mutational landscapes will be used to interpret and
support/reject hypotheses from simulations, including the role of ion-coupling in substrate transport regulation, proposed
free energy barriers in the conformational-free energy landscape that limit import kinetics, and how sodium-neurotransmitter
symport is coupled by a shared cytosolic exit pathway. Other notable features that arise from the deep mutational scans
(e.g. putative regulatory sites) will be further explored, and a machine learning algorithm will be applied to transfer
mutagenesis information to related transporters; the predicted mutational landscapes will then be validated by a small
number of informative targeted mutants. We will further relate sequence to conformation and activity in metabotropic
neurotransmitter receptors and sugar transporters. Finally, we plan to improve the proposed transfer algorithms by using
deep learning techniques, which will facilitate integration of features derived from simulation datasets and multiple deep
mutational scans to inform the effect of mutations on related proteins or tasks.
The success of the proposed research program of results will be measured by development of algorithms that can accurately
predict the variant effects on protein structure and function, elucidation of the mechanisms of ion-coupled regulation of
neurotransmitter transport, selectivity mechanisms in sugar transporters and activation mechanisms of class C GPCRs."
10930823,"ABSTRACT
Approximately 600,000 people live with partial hand amputations in the United States, with an estimated 14,500
new cases occurring each year. Despite the advances in miniaturized electronics and motors, there has been
very little advancement in mechatronic prosthetic digits for this underserved patient population. In fact, to date,
there is only one myoelectric prosthetic option for patients with partial hand loss in the US. This option is fragile,
often limited to light-duty tasks, and is too large to use on most partial hand loss cases. Considering this, it is no
surprise that less than half of the individuals with partial hand absence are able to return to their previous
employment, and those who do must often make considerable changes to their work-related tasks.
Thus, there is a substantial need to deliver a robust, low-profile myoelectric prosthetic digit system. To address
this need, we have formed a collaborative development team that has successfully launched six devices, which
have been fit on over 3,300 patients with upper limb loss and has significant regulatory experience, having
received two 510(k) approvals and five CE marks for upper limb prosthetic devices. With this background,
through this Fast-Track SBIR application, our collaborative team will develop and launch the Point Powered
system: an advanced mechatronic prosthesis system for individuals with partial hand loss which includes 1)
robust Point Powered digits; 2) low profile EMG electrodes; 3) a multi-input controller; 4) an iPad-based user
interface and 5) a flexible battery-based power system. The Point Powered system will 1) have industry leading
strength and speed, 2) offer anatomical rotation and flexion around the patient’s metacarpophalangeal (MCP)
joint, 3) have three anatomically accurate joints and sizes small enough to accommodate over 90% of men and
women, and 4) be compatible with future sophisticated control strategies.
In Phase I, we will perform three main tasks: 1) complete working prototypes of the electromechanical Point
Powered digit, controller, electrodes, and user interface 2) perform iterative testing with a focus group of 5
patients and prosthetists and verify component-level functionality and 3) complete internal verification on the
Point Powered system. Successful completion of these tasks will gate the progress of the project to Phase II.
In Phase II, the Point Powered system will be evaluated in two aims. In the first aim, we will complete third-party
verification to ensure compliance with medical device standards and we will perform clinical validations in
preparation for our long-term clinical study. Once the verification and validation steps are complete, a clinical
trial will be conducted to evaluate the system in 10 participants with partial hand loss against their standard-of-
care treatment. At the conclusion of these studies, we will have established safety and efficacy of the devices
and will submit a 510(k) application for premarket clearance. It is our long-term goal that the Point Powered
system will achieve a high degree of clinical impact through empowerment of partial hand amputees."
10842323,"Project Summary
Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) affects ~300,000 people in the US, with 11,000 new cases/year. After SCI, spinal reflex
function becomes abnormal, contributing to motor impairments and spasticity that affects 65-78% of people
with SCI. Thus, restoring the function of spinal reflex pathways is a major therapeutic goal. Current therapies
are only moderately successful; motor function often does not return to pre-injury levels.
Research led by Dr. Wolpaw at the National Center for Adaptive Neurotechnologies (NCAN) and Dr. Thompson
at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) has developed a novel noninvasive therapy that targets
beneficial change to specific spinal reflex pathways. The patient learns, through operant conditioning, to modify
the brain’s control over the pathway. This modified control gradually changes the pathway, and triggers favorable
plasticity in other pathways as well. In people with SCI, spinal reflex conditioning reduces spasticity, eliminates
limping, and increases walking speed. The benefits persist; and they are apparent to people in their daily lives.
Clinical translation of this powerful new therapy is now impractical because the reflex conditioning system is
complex and requires a highly-trained operator. To realize its therapeutic potential, reflex conditioning needs an
integrated hardware/software system that can be mastered quickly and used effectively by therapists. BioCircuit
Technologies has the essential hardware; NCAN and MUSC have the essential software and clinical expertise.
BioCircuit has a strong record in transforming complex technology into turnkey systems. Working together,
BioCircuit, NCAN, and MUSC propose to create a reflex conditioning system suitable for widespread clinical use.
Phase I - Aim 1 will integrate hardware to record EMG from multiple sites and stimulate the peripheral nerve
with software to control recording and stimulation and provide real-time visual feedback to the patient and
results to the therapist. This new system will combine BioCircuit’s recording/stimulation platform, NCAN’s
automated algorithms, and MUSC’s clinical methods. Through formal clinician usability tests, we will optimize
the system and confirm its robustness and usability. Aim 2 will establish the device compliance and regulatory
pathway based on FDA feedback, bring development under design and quality system control, ensure regulatory
compliance, and guide the Phase II clinical study and the pathway to a future FDA 510(k) submission.
Phase II - Aim 1 will validate the effectiveness of the new system in people with chronic incomplete SCI. We
expect that reflex conditioning with the new system will equal or exceed that of the old system. Aim 2 will assess
the impact of the new system on motor function, quality of life, and community participation. We expect that its
benefits will equal or exceed those of the old system. These studies will identify metrics for a large post-Phase II
study. Aim 3 will gather initial data on safety for an FDA 510(k) submission for use in SCI.
This project will produce a robust clinically practical reflex conditioning system that enables this noninvasive
new therapy to complement traditional therapies and enhance recovery for people with SCI and other disorders."
10895551,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In this MIRA program, we aim to gain atomic-level insights into complex biological
systems such as bacterial membrane proteins and light-sensitive proteins with particular
emphasis on their native protein and lipid environments. We will test the impact of such
biochemical environments in two distinct projects.
A wide variety of toxic chemicals, including toxic metal oxides and hydroxides, pollute our
environment, posing an imminent threat to human life. One can leverage the unique
respiration mechanism in marine microbes like Shewanella to revolutionize
bioremediation and wastewater treatment technology. Molecular modeling and
computations will provide an atomic-scale comprehension of the mechanism that will
augment macroscale experimental observables. In the first project, we will model the
outer membrane cytochrome-porin complex of Shewanella oneidensis in its native
environment and obtain molecular insights into the charge-transfer network employed in
its respiration.
Electronically excited-state processes are ubiquitous in nature and biotechnology. For
example, blue-light-sensitive proteins are used in the optogenetic control of cellular
processes. Fluorescent proteins with emissions spanning the entire visible region are
often utilized for in vivo imaging. In these applications, subtle structural changes in an
electronically excited molecule induce pronounced conformational changes in the nearby
protein environment or further from its location (allostery). Therefore, the biochemical
environment relays the information at the photon-absorption site to another site. Most
conformational changes occur well beyond a few nanoseconds, making them
inaccessible to modern multi-scale quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM)
techniques. Therefore, in the second project, we will build a tool to model excited states
of biomolecules using force field parameters and then validate those parameters using a
few case studies with fluorescent proteins. Furthermore, we will use those parameters to
decipher photoinduced allosteric pathways in blue-light-sensitive proteins."
10932150,"The ability to visualize simultaneously a large number of distinct molecular species with high spatiotemporal resolution is crucial for interrogating complex and dynamic biological systems but still remains a major challenge in bioimaging. This is especially true for multiplex sensing of cellular analytes including reactive species, metal ions, and a plethora of difficult-to-tag metabolites. The prevalent fluorescence microscopy is severely limited for this because of the “color barrier”. Non-linear Raman imaging techniques such as Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS) have become an increasingly valuable bioanalytical tool by offering a much greater number of resolvable ‘colors’ based on the narrower spectral linewidth of the Raman scattering bands. However, the lack of responsiveness of current Raman ‘tagging’ technologies hinders detection of changes in concentration of species of interest over time, limiting the application of SRS to the acquisition of mostly static pictures. 
 The goal of this project is to establish the next generation chemical toolbox and complementary instrumentation to enable high-speed, super-multiplexed monitoring of transient species and events in live cells, an important but otherwise intractable goal by other traditional optical methods. We propose to design and synthesize a library of novel responsive vibrational probes for SRS and electronic pre-resonance (epr) -SRS sensing of ions, small reactive molecules and enzymatic activity (Specific Aim 1), amenable for use with state-of-the-art SRS microscopy instrumentation. The new technology will be tested for the super-multiplexed visualization of these molecular targets in the context of ER and mitochondrial interactions and remodeling in live cells (Specific Aim 2). Successful completion of the proposed plan will establish a transformative technology that would enable concurrent, dynamic visualization of key molecular components, structures and processes with high spatiotemporal resolution. This capability is essential for gaining an integrated view of cellular networks and their crosstalk and would find wide applications in unraveling complex systems in the realm of cell biology, neurobiology, immunology, and tumor biology."
10895590,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tibia and fibula fractures account for 10% of annual osteoporotic fractures leading to significant morbidity with
a 10% mortality rate within 12 months of fracture. Low bone mineral density can dramatically increase fracture
risk resulting from a decrease in bone formation by the osteoblast, an increase in bone resorption by the
osteoclast, or both. A greater understanding of factors regulating tibial bone mineral density will help prevent
tibial fracture through identification of at-risk individuals and treatment of low tibial bone mineral density.
Sensory nerves signal to and from bone. Both signaling directions are critical aspects of bone homeostasis and
bone health. Sensory nerve communication with bone has been linked to an increase in bone mineral density
through direct and indirect communication between sensory nerves and both osteoblast and osteoclasts while
denervation is linked to reduced bone mass. However, it is unclear what impact long-term disruption of these
signaling pathways has on bone health. The saphenous nerve is primarily a sensory nerve with no known
motor function. Injury to the saphenous nerve results in pain, numbness, and denervation of the nerve itself.
Preliminary studies have demonstrated that the saphenous nerve innervates the tibia in mice. Preliminary data
has shown that transection of the saphenous nerve reduces tibial nerve fiber density by 45-60% in the
proximal, lateral-most periosteum of the tibia. However, the impact of saphenous nerve injury on tibial bone
mineral density is unknown. We hypothesize that saphenous nerve denervation will alter bone remodeling
within the tibia resulting in reduced bone mass. In order to test this hypothesis, Aim 1 will characterize the
impact of saphenous nerve transection on tibial bone mass and innervation. These data will determine whether
denervation of the tibia will result in a decreased bone mineral density, microarchitecture, cell number, and
turnover. It will also further identify regions of innervation loss within the tibia following saphenous nerve injury.
In an effort to delineate the mechanism of sensory regulation of bone, Aim 2 will assess the relative
contribution of sensory nerve fiber subtypes on tibial bone mass through chemical ablation of peptidergic and
non-peptidergic sensory neurons using resiniferatoxin and IB4-Saporin, respectively. As CGRP has been
demonstrated to promote bone anabolism, we hypothesize that selective ablation of peptidergic sensory fibers
will result in bone loss whereas selective ablation of non-peptidergic sensory fibers will not alter bone
remodeling or bone mass. These data will reveal the sensory nerve fiber subtype necessary for maintaining
bone mineral density. The proposed studies will define the saphenous nerve as an important regulator of bone
homeostasis in the tibia. A greater understanding of the impact of nerve injury on bone mass will aid in
elucidating new risk factors predisposing individuals to tibial fracture."
10890128,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) produces a spectrum of pathophysiological and behavioral consequences that
severely affect the quality of life of people living with these disorders, family members and caregivers. The
successful translation of therapeutic interventions to the clinic to improve neurological outcomes through
multicenter TBI trials is yet to be achieved. There is therefore a great need for continued research into novel
post-traumatic therapeutic strategies that may target multiple cellular and molecular mechanisms of cell
vulnerability, death and repair. We have developed FDA-approved protocols to isolate and grow millions of
human Schwann cells (hSC) and have most recently received a compassionate use Investigational New Drug
to test hSC-derived exosomes (hSC-Exos) for a neurodegenerative disorder. Based on supportive preliminary
data, we propose to conduct a series of critical studies to evaluate the optimal dose and therapeutic window for
hSC-Exos treatment on structural, biochemical, and long-term behavioral outcomes using an established model
of severe TBI. Our overall hypothesis is that intravenous administration of hSC-Exos after TBI will target multiple
secondary injury mechanisms as well as reparative processes leading to improved histopathological and
longterm behavioral outcomes. We propose that a major mechanism for this benefit will include anti-inflammatory
effects that will promote cytoprotection as well as enhance the opportunity for endogenous reparative processes.
We also suggest that this approach can be successfully translated into humans based on the results of this study
as our approach of isolating the hSC-Exos has been approved by the FDA. Specific Aim 1 will evaluate the dose-
response effects (3 doses) of the hSC-Exos in sham operated and TBI animals. Specific Aim 2 will then evaluate
the optimal dose of hSC-Exos on the therapeutic window on behavioral and histopathological outcomes. In
Specific Aim 3 we will measure temporal and regional pattens of inflammatory mediators including inflammasome
proteins in brain and blood samples after hSC-Exos treatment. To specifically study mechanisms of action,
Specific Aim 4 will evaluate the hSC-Exos cargo for the first time using state-of-the-art miRNA sequenceing and
informatic approaches. For all studies, we will utilize the penetrating ballistic-like brain injury model in male and
female Sprague Dawley rats, clinically relevant outcome measures, biochemical analyses and include strateges
to enhance scientific rigor and reproducibility. For the assemment of the hSC-Exos cargo, we will work with an
established company to conduct next generation RNA sequencing and mRNA libraries, document the various
molecular mechanisms of action and test cause and effect relationships while providing new knowledge to this
field of neurotrauma. The results of this proposal will have a significant impact on the field of neurotrauma by
investigating a new cell based neuroprotective therapy that may also promote endogenous reparative processes.
We propose an innovative therapeutic approach to be used in the acute and subacute injury settings based on
supportive preliminary data which clearly has the potential to improve the quality of life in this patient population."

Mechanical forces are often modulated in diseased or wounded tissues as a result of inflammatory responses
driven by immune cell activity in the affected site(s). In fact, aberrant mechanical force generation in pathological
settings may mediate disease progression and treatment resistance. However, little is known about the response
of immune cells to these mechanical forces, particularly at the tissue-length scale, and even in normal
physiological settings. Thus there is a critically unmet need to fill overlooked gaps in our basic understanding of
the interplay between tissue-level mechanical forces and immune cell behavior, both collectively and at the
single-cell level. With the support of the NIGMS R35 MIRA for Early Stage Investigators over the next five years,

forces on the phenotype and function of innate and adaptive immune cells in a variety of organs. Leveraging
engineering-based tools and approaches, we will couple unbiased omics platforms to mechanical testing at
multiple scales (e.g., on cells in vivo, tissues ex vivo, and organs in vivo) in order to relate immune response to
mechanical forces. During multiscale compression, the trafficking, distribution, motility, cell-cell interactions, and
functional behavior of immune cells will be examined and perturbed via: i) intravital and dynamic imaging (e.g.,
with multiphoton microscopy of fluorescent cells or genetically engineered mouse models); ii) immunocompetent,
transgenic, and immunogenic animal models (e.g., OT-I/OT-II antigen systems); and iii) artificial intelligence-
based cell state analysis (e.g., from single cell RNA sequencing). We will also explore our hypothesis that
beneficial immune activity in the face of pathological conditions is suppressed by heightened tissue mechanical
forces. Importantly, the proposed Projects are to be performed in non-specific contexts that are independent of
tissue type, organ, or disease in order to maximize the potential for broad impact in the biomedical sciences.
The knowledge generated will lay the groundwork for future mechanistic and translational research in both
healthy and diseased settings. By operating at the interface of mechanical engineering and immunology in the

insights and pathophysiological targets for human disease."

A central goal of regenerative medicine is to understand how cells functionally integrate into existing tissues to
restore homeostasis and behavior. Studies of regeneration following tissue damage in a group of ~6 species
have made considerable advances towards this goal by uncovering mechanisms that promote proliferation,
fate specification, and new cell survival. Pursuing these mechanisms, however, has revealed an underlying
problem: how tissue re-patterning is limited to provide functional restoration and the re-establishment of
homeostasis without detrimental overgrowth. To understand how growth and patterning are limited, and
conversely, how tissues regress controllably will require broadening the systems in which these phenomena
are examined to include models of natural, cyclical and highly stereotyped re-growth and degeneration. One
such system – seasonally breeding songbirds – offers an outstanding opportunity to test mechanistic hypoth-
eses of growth and degeneration and how events and outcomes at molecular and cellular levels impact higher-
level anatomy and behavior. This lab makes use of two different songbird species: Gambel’s white-crowned
sparrow (Zonotrichia leugophrys gambelli) and the domesticated canary (Serinus canaria domestica). White-
crowned sparrows are advantageous in having dramatic cycles of seasonal degeneration and regeneration of
the neural circuit that controls singing behavior; an extensive literature detailing their natural history; and high
tractability for experimental analyses due to their natural abundance and robustness in the lab. Canary breeds,
each having unique singing abilities and well-documented genetics, promise the ability to link historical
selection for particular allelic variants to regenerative form and function, and plasticity at the level of individuals
and populations. Exploiting the natural and dramatic degeneration–regeneration cycles in sparrows this
proposal aims to determine how cell death: (i) influences generation of new cells to limit total growth of neural
tissue and (ii) is finely tuned to prevent excessive degeneration of tissue and behavior while maintaining
competency for a return to homeostasis and subsequent plasticity. Exploiting the tight genetic control imposed
by breeders in selecting for exaggerated singing in canaries, the work aims to determine how diversification of
behavior arose from modifications to the balance between degeneration and regeneration, and how genetic
changes translate to cellular plasticity and emergence of novel behavior. Towards these goals, this program
will use a highly integrative and complementary set of approaches – including pharmacological manipulations
of intact neural circuits in freely behaving birds; classic cellular, molecular, and histological analyses; and state-
of-the-art genomic approaches – to interrogate the cellular, molecular, and evolutionary mechanisms regulating
tissue patterning and homeostasis. Uncovering proximate and ultimate mechanisms underlying tissue
remodeling will add foundational knowledge to our understanding of hypertrophy and degenerative diseases
and may reveal new ways by which lost or damaged tissues can be replaced in a clinical context."

Federal and state policymakers, advocates, and community officials have implemented multiple strategies,
policies, and initiatives to address dimensions of the rapidly evolving opioid crisis. There has been progress on
many fronts, including increased access to medication treatment for opioid use disorder, decreased
prescription of opioid analgesics, and greater access to naloxone. However, the majority of individuals with
opioid use disorder do not receive the most effective treatments, and rates of fatal opioid overdose continue to
grow, due in part to a shift to illicit opioids and the mixing of fentanyl with other illicit drugs. Societal costs of the
crisis were an estimated $1.02 trillion in 2017. There has been a surge of opioid policy studies, many
enhanced by data, tools, and methods developed by OPTIC. But policymakers and policy researchers remain
challenged by the rapidly evolving nature of the crisis, including the growing recognition that the opioid crisis is
increasingly a polysubstance crisis involving synthetic opioids and the acknowledgement that structural
inequalities and systemic racism have exacerbated the burden for certain populations. We need new methods
to help us better understand the effects of policies at the state level, and we need to understand the longer-

the short and longer term across heterogeneous populations. We will create a series of simulation tools that
will inform and improve the methods opioid policy researchers and policy researchers more broadly utilize to
determine which policies are most effective for whom within the opioid crises. We will also continue to rapidly
and effectively disseminate resources, tools, and findings to the substance abuse research field, policymakers,
other stakeholders, and the general public. Rapid collection and dissemination of reliable data and robust
methods can dramatically increase the speed with which the substance abuse policy field can meet an
escalating demand for science-based information. OPTIC seeks to remain a leader in that effort and to enrich
its contributions as a national resource."
11060188,"Abstract
Federal and state policymakers, advocates, and community officials have implemented multiple strategies,
policies, and initiatives to address dimensions of the rapidly evolving opioid crisis. There has been progress on
many fronts, including increased access to medication treatment for opioid use disorder, decreased
prescription of opioid analgesics, and greater access to naloxone. However, the majority of individuals with
opioid use disorder do not receive the most effective treatments, and rates of fatal opioid overdose continue to
grow, due in part to a shift to illicit opioids and the mixing of fentanyl with other illicit drugs. Societal costs of the
crisis were an estimated $1.02 trillion in 2017. There has been a surge of opioid policy studies, many
enhanced by data, tools, and methods developed by OPTIC. But policymakers and policy researchers remain
challenged by the rapidly evolving nature of the crisis, including the growing recognition that the opioid crisis is
increasingly a polysubstance crisis involving synthetic opioids and the acknowledgement that structural
inequalities and systemic racism have exacerbated the burden for certain populations. We need new methods
to help us better understand the effects of policies at the state level, and we need to understand the longer-
term effects of the crisis on communities, especially how those effects are influenced by structural inequities
and racial/ethnic disparities. OPTIC will continue to meet these needs, building on our achievements of the first

10877048,"Administrative Core Abstract
The opioid crisis has become a polysubstance crisis involving synthetic opioids, and structural inequalities and
systemic racism have exacerbated burdens for the populations affected. Efforts to address the crisis must
occur in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected opioid use and policies related to
treatment. The RAND-USC Schaeffer Opioid Policy Tools and Information Center (OPTIC) enhances the ability
of the opioid policy research community to evaluate policy effects in this dynamic environment while also
enhancing policymakers’ use of opioid policy research. OPTIC’s Administrative Core (AC) supports OPTIC
Investigators in pursuing these objectives. The AC has and will continue to provide overall scientific oversight,
develop and monitor a master timeline for all tasks, and provide budgetary oversight. It will convene bi-annual
meetings of an External Advisory Board, which ensures that Center activities are focused on the most pressing
policy issues and addressing the field’s most salient methodological challenges. The AC fosters a collaborative
OPTIC community identity in multiple ways, including facilitating regular meetings of Research Project teams
as well as a bi-annual “all hands” meetings and producing an internal OPTIC newsletter informing staff of
current work and new resources. The AC is responsible for OPTIC’s internal list servs and Kiteworks and
Teams sites used to share all pertinent internal OPTIC communications and information among OPTIC staff.
The AC also supports efforts to support the development of junior investigators through Pilot Projects, grant
workshops, and “meet n’ greets” at national conferences. The AC maximizes research dissemination and
policy impact through a dedicated Communications and Dissemination Arm, ensuring that OPTIC leverages
RAND’s robust communications infrastructure across all Center activities. Another AC dissemination activity
includes a quarterly external e-newsletter that highlights recent work by OPTIC researchers and by other
experts in the field. A key dissemination focus is OPTIC’s website, which describes Center activities and
houses recent publications and products, data visualizations and research tools, and educational materials and
webinars. The AC collaborates with RAND’s Digital Strategy and Communications Group to curate the site,
ensuring that resources and tools are promptly and appropriately posted. Among the site’s many resources,
policymakers especially value the Key Takeaways, one-page summaries of OPTIC’s opioid research findings
tailored for policymakers. The AC manages the process of identifying appropriate Key Takeaway topics,
producing and reviewing content, and posting them on OPTIC’s site."
10877050,"DATA & METHODS CORE ABSTRACT
Researchers and policymakers need better data, improved methods, and rigorous analysis to best determine
which policies and initiatives are, or could be, effective in addressing the nation’s opioid-related public health
crisis. Research assessing the effectiveness of specific opioid policies and initiatives has surged, but much of
this work uses accessible existing policy datasets and familiar difference-in-difference and interrupted time
series analysis. Multiple studies have identified shortcomings of these methods in the presence of
heterogeneous treatment effects and policy endogeneity. Furthermore, while researchers have begun to pay
greater attention to inconsistencies in how opioid policy data are defined and operationalized, far less attention
has been given to the differential impacts the same policies have on different communities in light of
vulnerabilities and structural factors that lead to differential policy experiences. There is also increasing
evidence that the community environment itself influences opioid misuse and harm, raising questions about
how effective different opioid policy strategies might be given interactions with local factors. These conceptual
and methodological challenges need to be clearly defined and communicated to all those working in this policy
space. As a national resource, OPTIC has actively addressed this need, and OPTIC’s Data & Methods Core
(DMC) plays an essential role in that effort. Internally, the DMC maximizes the efficiency and quality of Center
work by providing the data, tools, and methodological support necessary to conduct high-quality, innovative
research. Externally, the DMC is a reliable resource for the scientific community, providing data to support
studies of policy effects and community vulnerabilities, publishing educational resources on data and methods
to enhance the rigor of such studies, conducting trainings for junior investigators developing research in this
area, and disseminating information on best methodological practices for evaluating policies affecting opioid-
related outcomes. The DMC will continue updating, tracking, gathering, and documenting opioid-related
policies and their specific components and timelines on a state-by-year basis (2000-2027). We will update our
comprehensive literature review on the use and/or effectiveness of federal and state policy approaches to the
opioid crisis, retaining our focus on the methodological rigor of the evaluations with additional attention to
differential effects of policy by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and types of drug misuse affected by the
policy. We will identify, construct, and assess metrics that capture the high risk of discriminatory
implementation and enforcement of opioid policies within communities, and we will continue to assist the
OPTIC community in the development and testing of new methods for dealing with complex and dynamic policy
environments."
10877053,"Policies Project Abstract
Policymakers have launched multiple initiatives to reduce inappropriate prescribing of opioid analgesics,
prevent opioid misuse, improve access to evidence-based treatment for opioid use disorder, and decrease
rates of opioid-related overdose morbidity and mortality. The efforts have been taken at various levels of
government, across different systems, and at different stages of the crisis. These layers of policy adoption
and implementation create challenges for identifying which strategies, or “bundle” of strategies, may be most
effective in reducing opioid-related harms. A growing number of opioid policy data resources have become
available, but all rely on a piecemeal approach to select the specific policies covered. This project will
develop an organizing classification framework for opioid policy surveillance and use the framework to
improve the existing addiction policy data infrastructure and enhance our scientific understanding of the
determinants of policy adoption and implementation. Using established best-practices from implementation
science and legal epidemiology, we will develop a taxonomy for describing, reporting, and organizing the
opioid policy landscape and assess the taxonomy’s relevance for broader addiction policy surveillance. We
will also map existing opioid policy data resources within the taxonomy to identify where there are needs for
new or improved opioid policy surveillance. Within three categories of the taxonomy, we will identify where
states are adopting relevant policies and where there are gaps in current policy approaches; within each of
the three categories, we will assess what factors influence states’ decisions to adopt particular policy
approaches. The project will help address limitations of existing opioid policy datasets; inform opioid policy
development within a more holistic framework of substance use and social policy; and lay the groundwork for
extending this project to broader application, with the ultimate goal of developing a policy surveillance system
that can characterize distinct components of the addiction policy environment (local, state, and federal) with
applicability to future drug crises. Study findings will help spur progress toward identifying strategies, or
combinations of strategies, most effective in reducing opioid-related harms."
10877057,"Outcomes Project ABSTRACT
The opioid crisis is a public health emergency in the United States affecting not only the people who use
drugs but also those who love them in their families/households and communities. While researchers and
policymakers are often focused on the direct outcomes experienced by people who use drugs such as
overdoses, misuse, and dependence, there is substantially less evidence quantifying the indirect,
downstream consequences of the opioid crisis on households (e.g., grandparenting, child welfare) and
communities (e.g., labor force participation, crime rates). The evolving and comprehensive impacts of the
opioid crisis are a policy priority. In this project, we will study the downstream consequences of the opioid
crisis. We will evaluate these outcomes given recent transitions of the opioid crisis first from prescription
opioids to heroin, followed by the transition to illicitly manufactured fentanyl and the subsequent growth in
polysubstance use. We will analyze outcomes related to family/household composition and intergenerational
dynamics as well as community composition and labor market. We will examine communities defined by
geography (state, county) and demographic characteristics (urban/rural status, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic
status).
Moreover, we will examine why the opioid crisis has disproportionately impacted some communities. We will
examine how variation in the downstream consequences of the opioid crisis results from community
resilience, differential drug-related criminal-legal enforcement, and/or differential public health policy
responses. This involves compiling a database of community characteristics describing resilience factors
(e.g., education, social connectedness) as well as measures of differential enforcement (e.g., excess drug-
related arrests) and policy responses (e.g., health spending). Also involved is the creation of indices
describing resilience, enforcement, and policy response. This analysis will inform how future policies can be
designed to equitably allocate resources and stem the progression of the opioid crisis.
After quantifying the evolving and variable relationship between the opioid crisis and its downstream
consequences, we will develop a procedure to systematically and comprehensively quantify the costs of the
opioid crisis. This procedure will focus on the indirect costs experienced by families/households and
communities and will enable comparisons to the direct costs experienced by people who use drugs. We will
assess costs for each wave of the opioid crisis and describe how the costs have changed over time. This
analysis will generate a method and public metrics for the costs of the opioid crisis and how these costs vary
across communities. This research will help the research community and policymakers understand the full
scope of the costs of the opioid crisis, including which factors are most costly."
10877063,"Methods Research Project Abstract
The nation’s opioid crisis continues unabated. The number of fatal overdoses increased nearly 30% in 2020,
reflecting the continued spread of fentanyl as well as the increased stress, social isolation, job loss, and
reduced access to treatment imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. States continue to enact a diverse array of
opioid-related policies, producing a complex and dynamic policy landscape. A core objective in opioid policy
research is to accurately identify policies that will achieve the intended outcomes, but state-level evaluation
studies must grapple with the limited statistical power afforded by the constrained sample size. Furthermore,
there is heightened interest in understanding the extent to which the intended gains from specific policies are
experienced equitably by all population subgroups and whether there are characteristics of states for which
specific policies are more or less effective. This study seeks to provide opioid policy researchers with clear
statistical guidance and novel statistical methods to conduct complex, high-quality policy evaluations. Opioid
policy effectiveness may vary along multiple dimensions including time and state-, community-, and individual-
level factors. To date, new econometric methods have focused on time-varying effects. In this context,
traditional difference-in-differences (DID) estimates have been shown to be biased towards zero. In contrast,
there has been limited attention to methods for examining differential policy effectiveness across state-,
community-, or individual-level factors, yet these types of policy effect heterogeneity and have important
ramifications for achieving equitable opioid-related outcomes. Obtaining robust effect estimates will require
methods that extend easily to multilevel settings and borrow information across observations and levels. In this
project, we will provide a comprehensive summary of the state of the statistical science in the opioid policy
space with regard to estimation of policy effect heterogeneity. We will also develop novel statistical methods to
address the complexities and sample size constraints inherent in examining policy effect heterogeneity. Finally,
we will create a series of simulation tools that will inform and improve the methods opioid policy researchers
and policy researchers more broadly utilize to determine which policies are most effective for whom within the
opioid crises. The work will make both short- and long-term contributions by shifting and improving the
statistical practice of opioid policy researchers, thereby improving the accuracy of opioid policy studies and
thus, the quality of evidence regarding which policies are most effective and for whom. Our overall goals are to
give applied policy researchers insights regarding the relative advantages and limitations of alternative
methods for estimating heterogeneous policy effects and to develop novel statistical methods and accessible
statistical guidance for conducting opioid policy evaluations, thereby providing the field with better tools for
implementing such research."

Protein phosphorylation plays a key role in numerous cellular processes through a dynamic balance between
protein kinases and phosphatases. In many disease conditions, this balance is inclined toward kinase
hyperactivation and/or phosphatase inactivation, which are highly related to changes of their posttranslational
modifications (PTMs). Being able to introduce multiple PTMs on such specific signaling enzymes in a
chemically well-defined manner is both impactful and transformative to understand cell signaling pathways and
the function of PTMs. In previous study, by employing protein semisynthesis methods to generate
homogenous protein kinase Akt forms as substrates or stoichiometrically phosphorylated at Ser473 as
calibration standards, we provided a detailed portrait of how mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2) but not mTORC1
can selectively recognize and phosphorylate Akt Ser473 to activate this key signaling kinase. In this proposal,
we continue to develop and utilize protein semisynthesis methods to elucidate the regulation of two key
signaling enzymes including protein kinase S6K1 and the heterotrimeric phosphatase PP2A by PTMs and
other allosteric mechanisms. S6K1 is a crucial downstream effector of mTORC1, and is critically regulated by
the phosphorylation of a cluster of Ser/Thr residues (Ser411, Ser418, Thr421 and Ser424) in the C-terminal
autoinhibitory domain (CTD). Yet how the CTD phosphorylation modulates S6K1 structure and function has
been poorly defined. The PP2A phosphatase heterotrimer is responsible to the vast majority Ser/Thr
phosphatase activity in eukaryotic cells, and its assembly has been linked to changes in the C-terminal PTMs
of the C subunit including Thr304 and Tyr307 phosphorylations and Leu309 methylation. However, the function
of these PTMs has yet to be fully characterized, and remain a great of interest in the field. It is also very little
known how PP2A recruits its substrates, limiting our understanding of PP2A-regulated signaling. We will
produce these two enzymes containing site-specific PTMs and their non-hydrolyzable analogs, and will
integrate kinetic assays, structural analysis, binding measurements, and cell-based studies to clarify the
structural and catalytic features. Moreover, we have developed a novel proximity crosslinking method using
nanobodies as proximity-directing agents for analyzing PP2A interactome in different cellular conditions in
response to various stimuli. Successful completion of this project will not only provide a detailed molecular
understanding of how these two signaling enzymes regulated by specific PTMs, but inspire novel therapeutic
strategies combat the diseases associated with their dysregulation."

Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) is a unique, highly conserved, and highly regulated mammalian P450
monooxygenase. CYP2E1 undergoes extensive post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation, including
bimodal targeting to endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. There are no known loss of function mutations in
the human population, and no known polymorphic variants that change the coding region of the protein,
indicating an important endogenous role for CYP2E1. However, knockout of CYP2E1 in rodent models has not
yielded a dramatic phenotype, and has been reported to be protective against diet-induced obesity,
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and ethanol-induced toxicity. Therapeutic targeting of CYP2E1 has been
recommended for liver repair after alcoholic liver damage and to improve the efficacy of a ketogenic diet for the
treatment of epilepsy. However, there remain major gaps in our understanding of the endogenous function of
CYP2E1 that must be addressed before CYP2E1 can be safely inhibited in humans, particularly in the long-
term. This proposal addresses these challenges using the expertise of the Hartman lab, resources and
reagents we have generated to study CYP2E1, and the expertise of our collaborators. The overall goal of the
research program is to discover the endogenous function and regulation of CYP2E1 and the consequences of
CYP2E1 activity in mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. Overview of research and goals for the next five
years: The Hartman Lab opened at MUSC during the beginning of the pandemic. It pursues key questions like:
How does the cell decide how much CYP2E1 to send to mitochondria vs. the endoplasmic reticulum?
Mechanisms of nascent polypeptide targeting will be determined through genetic and pharmacological
approaches. What are the endogenous functions of CYP2E1 in multiple tissues? CYP2E1 is known to
metabolize acetone to acetol and methylglyoxal, and to hydroxylate fatty acids at the omega and omega-1
position, but these activities have not been studied in the context of overall cellular metabolism and have
generally only focused on liver. We are investigating the tissue-specific endogenous functions in multiple
tissues. What are the consequences of CYP2E1 expression in mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum?
Emerging evidence in our lab suggests that for ethanol and acetaminophen, mitochondrial CYP2E1 is a liability
for drug-induced cellular damage, but for fatty acids, endoplasmic reticular CYP2E1 drives lipid stress.
Therefore, there are organelle-specific liabilities that must be further defined. Together this work will address
arising and long-standing fundamental questions about CYP2E1."

Despite the high prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), there are currently no approved
medications to treat NAFLD. Metformin is frequently discussed as a promising treatment for NAFLD but reports
on the efficacy of metformin in NAFLD patients are not consistent. Hence, the effect of metformin on hepatic lipid
metabolism and the underlying mechanisms warrant further research. Metformin is thought to directly regulate
hepatic lipid metabolism via activating hepatic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which subsequently
inhibits de novo lipogenesis and promotes fatty acid oxidation in liver. However, there is a lack of quantitative
assessment of to what extent hepatic lipogenesis or fatty acid oxidation is affected by metformin in vivo. In
addition, due to high concentrations of metformin in the intestine, the intestine has emerged as an important
action site of metformin. Dr. Huang generated intestinal epithelium-specific AMPK alpha 1 knockout mice and
observed that the beneficial effect of metformin was attenuated in these mice (Nature Communications 2022),
suggesting that the action of metformin in intestine is required for correcting dietary-induced metabolic disorders.
Due to the pleiotropic effects of metformin, omics analysis such as metabolomics, lipidomics, and 13C isotope
tracing will be required to quantitively and systemically assess the metabolic effects of metformin in different
organs. In a pilot study, I performed metabolomics and lipidomics analysis using liquid chromatography coupled
to high resolution mass spectrometer (LC-HRMS). The preliminary data suggest that the number of metabolites
and lipids altered by metformin positively correlated with concentrations of metformin in these tissues, and
metformin-induced metabolic and lipidomic changes were more profound in intestine due to the high
concentration in intestine. We also synthesized a metformin probe containing an alkyne group, which will be
used to identify the molecular target of metformin. In the next five years, I will combine my expertise in omics
analysis with metformin probe and genetically modified mice developed by Dr. Huang to test the hypothesis that
metformin induces beneficial metabolic and lipidomic alterations in intestine, enhances intestinal functions (e.g.,
sugar clearance) and subsequently shields liver from dietary-induced damage. The immediate goal of this
project is to elucidate the action site and underlying mechanisms through which metformin protects the liver
against high fructose-induced metabolic damage. The long-term goal is to 1) develop strategies to enhance the
metabolic capacity of intestinal epithelial cells for alleviating liver steatosis and 2) to provide insights into
identifying NAFLD patients who likely benefit from metformin monotherapy and developing optimal strategies to
prevent or treat NAFLD. Even though this proposed study is focused on metformin in the context of dietary-
induced liver disease, methods and discoveries in this study are expected to make a broad impact in diseases
with dysregulated metabolism."

OSA is defined by repetitive collapse of the upper airway, a process which leads to transient hypoxemia and
arousals from sleep, and is associated with various cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurocognitive
consequences. OSA is the most common respiratory disorder, affecting roughly 10% of middle aged men and
women in the USA and up to 1 billion globally. Although continuous positive airway pressure (PAP) is an
efficacious therapy, it is not always well tolerated and adherence is less than ideal. OSA is increasingly
recognized as a multifactorial disorder that can occur in different people for different reasons, not only due to
anatomical predisposition (collapsibility of the upper airway), but also related to low arousal threshold (wake up
too easily), dysfunction in upper airway dilator muscles and instability in ventilatory control. Through careful
measurement of these underlying factors and the symptoms experienced in OSA, this proposal seeks to
understand how different mechanisms underlying OSA – endotypes – lead to different symptoms or
consequences – phenotypes. These different phenotypes range from having no appreciable symptoms, to
falling asleep at the wheel, to experiencing cardiometabolic consequences. Additionally, addressing the
underlying cause might be useful to personalize therapy, to predict adherence to PAP, and to understand which
symptoms will or will not improve with long term PAP therapy. A major challenge in clinical practice is
understanding whether particular symptoms are due to OSA, and whether these symptoms will improve with
treatment. Moreover, we are currently struggling to find alternative therapies for OSA which will likely depend on
underlying mechanism. Similarly, we do not currently know which patients to put into clinical trials since it seems
unlikely that, e.g., all OSA patients will have cardiovascular benefits to PAP therapy since not all are at risk of
heart disease. Our goals are 1) To understand the contribution of the underlying cause, or endotype, of OSA to
the symptoms experienced by people with OSA, 2) To elucidate how the endotype predicts response to non
CPAP therapies, such as oxygen or sedative hypnotics, and 3) To define how underlying endotype (mechanism)
mediates changes in phenotype (clinical manifestations of disease) with treatment of OSA. Ultimately we hope
that our efforts will advance the OSA field and help to alleviate suffering or reduce/prevent disease burden."
10881730,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Empyema (EMP) is increasing in frequency worldwide and is associated with a mortality rate of up to 20% in
patients older than 65 years. Thoracic surgery for treating EMP is invasive and many patients have co-morbidities
that preclude its use. Bleeding remains a major concern and occurs in up to about 5-15% of EMP patients treated
with intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy (IPFT). These factors offer a premise for the identification of more effective,
well-tolerated forms of IPFT that better address the molecular mechanisms governing intrapleural fibrinolysis,
particularly in advanced-stage EMP. The need for more efficacious, innovative forms of IPFT represents a gap
in the field that is of high priority and addressed in this project. The objective of our study is to identify novel
interventions that improve therapeutic outcomes in subjects with EMP using a fibrin-targeted delivery of
encapsulated plasminogen activators (PAs) combined with ultrasound sonofibrinolysis (US) in a validated model
of Streptococcus pneumoniae induced EMP in rabbits. Liposomal carriers with single chain (sc) tissue (sctPA)
and urokinase (scuPA), and resistant to plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 “molecular cage” type complexes with
α-macroglobulin (αM/uPA) will be tested. Our preliminary data demonstrate that (i) transthoracic US or sctPA-
based liposomes (TELIP) with nanomolar affinity to fibrin improve therapeutic outcomes of an otherwise
ineffective dose of fibrinolysin; (ii) US promotes intrapleural formation of αM/uPA, which correlates with success
of IPFT in pleural injury. Our hypothesis is that combining intrapleural delivery of low doses of a fibrinolysin
encapsulated within fibrin targeted carriers with ultrasound sonofibrinolysis will additively increase the
intrapleural half-life of plasminogen activators and rate of fibrinolysis, enhancing the efficacy of IPFT in acute
and chronic S. pneumoniae induced EMP. The hypothesis will be tested in three Specific Aims: 1. Determine
the minimal effective doses (MEDs) of echogenic liposomal carriers for treatment of S. pneumoniae induced
EMP in rabbits. 2. Identify the ultrasound mechanical index and treatment schedule that optimizes outcomes of
IPFT in rabbits with S. pneumoniae induced EMP. 3. Use the additivity of transthoracic ultrasound and fibrin-
targeted carrier delivery to increase the efficacy of IPFT in S. pneumoniae induced EMP. Our project team
consists of two groups with expertise in translational research, IPFT, management of EMP, therapeutic
commercialization, and liposomal carrier formulation and delivery. By applying state-of-the-art biochemical,
biophysical, physiologic, tissue analysis and imaging techniques, we will accomplish the Research Plan to
address the current gaps in empyema treatment and expand our understanding of sonochemical mechanisms.
If, as expected, this project succeeds, a new, well-tolerated, more effective and clinically tractable paradigm for
IPFT will emerge that may ultimately improve outcomes in patients with empyema."

Primary and metastatic central nervous system tumors (CNS) are associated with a high degree of morbidity
and mortality. There is a need for new and more effective strategies for diagnosing, treating and monitoring
patients with primary and metastatic CNS tumors. Methodologies that address the need for molecular
information that is required for the use of precision medicine and targeted therapies, in patients with CNS
tumors, are limited. A liquid biopsy assay will facilitate early molecular characterization and monitoring of
patients with CNS tumors and will revolutionize patient management. Studies have shown that blood is not a
suitable fluid for the detection of tumor-derived biomarkers in patients with CNS malignancies. In contrast,
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), due to its proximity to the brain parenchyma, is a source of informative biomarkers
(e.g., circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and metabolites). We hypothesize that it is possible to perform pre-
operative molecular characterization and monitoring of patients with CNS tumors by analyzing ctDNA and
metabolites in the CSF. Moreover, our prediction is that the levels of these biomarkers will correlate with tumor
burden. We anticipate that quantification of these biomarkers in the CSF will facilitate monitoring patients with
CNS cancer for tumor recurrence and response to therapies. Our preliminary experiments show that we can
isolate ctDNA from small volumes of CSF and detect mutations by next generation sequencing (NGS) and
droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), at a mutant allele frequency of 0.25% and 0.1%, respectively. We have also
identified tumor-specific metabolic signatures in the CSF, and our data shows higher levels of D-2-
hydroglyglutarate in the CSF of patients with CNS tumors harboring an IDH1/IDH2 mutation. We propose to
pursue two specific aims to develop a CSF-liquid biopsy assay: (1) Validation of a next generation sequencing
(NGS) assay to quantify tumor DNA in CSF; (2) To perform metabolomic analysis of ~125 tumor-derived
metabolites in CSF. This multi-platform approach will allow comparisons of sensitivity and specificity among
various methodologies and cross correlation of results between platforms. Volumetric analysis of CNS lesions
in MRI will allow us to evaluate the potential of each biomarker for quantifying CNS tumor burden. We
anticipate that these studies will culminate in the clinical implementation of a liquid biopsy assay to facilitate
diagnosis and the use of targeted therapies in adult of pediatric patients with primary or metastatic CNS
tumors."

Given the rising prevalence of obesity, poor diet and physical inactivity, known in combination as “energy
balance” or “energetics”, as well as their associations with cancer incidence and mortality, innovative research,
clinical care and training of scientists are needed to lower the prevalence of these risk factors and in turn, lower
cancer incidence and mortality rates. In September 2020, the NCI released its Fiscal Year 2022 Budget
proposal, which includes obesity and cancer as a featured scientific topic and training the next generation of
cancer researchers as a key investment. With NCI R25 support from 2016-2021, we developed and offered an
annual one-week, in-residence Transdisciplinary Research in Energetics and Cancer (TREC) Training Course,
followed by a yearlong mentoring program, that focused on energy balance and cancer research across the
cancer control continuum. The overall goals of this Program were to educate, train and mentor 100 early
career investigators, called TREC Fellows, from diverse academic backgrounds (i.e., basic, clinical and
population sciences) in transdisciplinary research in energetics and cancer. For the first four years of TREC,
we admitted and trained 97 Fellows from 57 different institutions. We are in our 5th year of our TREC Program
and expect to recruit 20 more Fellows, for a total of 117 Fellows completing the TREC Training Program.
TREC Fellows have published 270 manuscripts in peer-reviewed journals, with 62 published manuscripts
including the TREC Fellow as first or senior author and including a TREC Faculty and/or Fellow as co-author.
Since completing the Program, TREC Fellows have received 31 extramural grants, as principal investigator.
Building upon the strengths of the previous five years but responsive to additional opportunities for training and
further dissemination of the course, the goals of our competitive renewal are: 1) to offer a hybrid TREC
Training Program with virtual TREC Faculty-led programs before the in-person workshop focused on
increasing content knowledge; 2) followed by a 5-day in-person workshop focused on the Fellows’ research,
networking and professional development; and 3) year-long mentorship between the Fellow and Faculty
Mentor and Peer Mentor. Led by Dr. Melinda Irwin and drawing from the resources of the Yale School of Public
Health, Yale Cancer Center, and ~20 expert TREC Faculty from across the country and 100+ TREC Fellow
alumni from around the world, our TREC Program is innovative in that currently no training opportunity exists
that focuses on energetics and cancer research. Our goal is to continue the TREC mission of training scientists
to develop a cadre of well-trained, diverse researchers. The overall impact of this program will be defined by
the degree to which TREC Fellows produce innovative research approaches and discoveries, thereby
accelerating the dissemination and implementation of evidence-based approaches into everyday practice and
patient care, in turn improving the health of the population at risk for cancer as well as cancer survivors."

University of Delaware. The ACCEL CTR Program, has completed nine years of funding at the time of
this application. During our third funding cycle (ACCEL3), our consortium will consist of four partners:
University of Delaware (UD)—the lead institution; Nemours Children’s Health (Nemours); Christiana
Care Health System (CCHS), the largest health care system in Delaware; and Delaware State University
(DSU), an American historically Black, public university that joined our consortium during the last
competitive renewal. Over the past nine years, ACCEL has established an exceedingly strong network
and infrastructure for clinical and translational (C&T) research within the state of Delaware; and, we are
now poised and ready to continue our growth trajectory. While we will continue with the activities that

greater focus on building a bi-directional relationship between our scientists and the community so that
we can have a greater impact on Delawareans. Delaware is an ideal state for a CTR grant as it
represents the whole of the USA in a compact form. The population of Delaware (~970,000) mirrors the
US population in urban-to-rural citizen ratio and ethnic/racial diversity, with 23% African American, 62%
Caucasian, 10% Hispanic, 4% Asian and 1% Native American. Thus, studies involving a cross-section of
Delaware can be generalizable to populations nationally. The dominance of adult (CCHS) and pediatric
(Nemours) hospital systems, which serve at least 85% of the residents of the state, provides a unique
opportunity to treat the state of Delaware as a model for examining how healthcare changes can impact
population health. The overarching goal of the ACCEL CTR Program is to create a unified Delaware
Clinical and Translational Research Community (inclusive of investigators and community members) that
breaks down existing barriers, capitalizes on the unique strengths of its partners to establish
infrastructure and accelerates the creation of equitable solutions that improve the health of all
Delawareans and all Americans."

This proposal is a competitive renewal of the Institutional Development Award Program Infrastructure for
Clinical and Translational Research (IDeA-CTR)(U54) grant originally awarded in September 2013 to the
University of Delaware. The ACCEL CTR Program, has completed nine years of funding at the time of
this application. During our third funding cycle (ACCEL3), our consortium will consist of four partners:
University of Delaware (UD)—the lead institution; Nemours Children’s Health (Nemours); Christiana
Care Health System (CCHS), the largest health care system in Delaware; and Delaware State University
(DSU), an American historically Black, public university that joined our consortium during the last
competitive renewal. Over the past nine years, ACCEL has established an exceedingly strong network
and infrastructure for clinical and translational (C&T) research within the state of Delaware; and, we are
now poised and ready to continue our growth trajectory. While we will continue with the activities that
have made us successful, we will have a sharper focus on building sustainable infrastructure across

10915542,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the fifth leading cause of death in the US. As a life-shortening genetic disease, CF is
characterized by abnormalities in the pulmonary and digestive systems due to systemic inflammation, fibrosis,
and tissue degradation. About half of adult CF patients experience cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD). Unlike
the common type I or type II diabetes, CFRD develops at the very early stages of life of people with CF and
leads to greatly worsened lung disease. Although new therapeutics – such as the triple combination CFTR
modulator therapy TRIKAFTA – are impacting lung function for many patients, these therapies do not appear to
be solving the endocrine problems experienced by people with CF. More precise and effective methods of early
detection of this disease are urgently needed for progression prevention and to drastically lower the death rate.
This project, if successful, will transform the management of patients with CFRD into more effective treatment
strategies. Our first goal is to understand the role of MT1E on β-cell functions and survival during the
development of CFRD. Our second goal is to elucidate the impact of exocrine cells expressing mutant CFTR
on endocrine islets. Our third goal is to resolve a single-cell (scRNA-seq) map of islets from healthy, CFRD,
and TRIKAFTA-treated CF ferrets. Our central hypothesis is that redox imbalance and tissue remodeling
contribute to CFRD progression by altering endocrine function through the metallothionein 1 E pathway. First,
this project is expected to shed light on the molecular mechanism of Metallothionein 1E (MT1E) in regulating
pancreatic damage in patients with CFRD, using pluripotent stem cell-derived human pancreatic exocrine and
endocrine organoids. Second, by using cutting-edge collagen-based magnetic resonance imaging, this project
will map the location and severity of fibrosis in the pancreas during the development of CFRD. Finally, performing
high throughput single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of the pre-clinical model of CFRD, the CFTRG551D/-KI ferret,
this project will identify essential biomarkers during the progression of CFRD. Ultimately, these studies broaden
our understanding of the pathogenesis of CFRD and provide the basis for using Magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) as a potential diagnostic approach for disease early detection. The project also serves as an opportunity
for the PI to shift directions in his research program, learning new techniques that will greatly enable his future
career."
10925203,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Long-term outcomes after lung transplantation remain disappointing, and the median survival is 6.7 years.
Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) is the leading cause of death beyond the first year after lung
transplantation. Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), which is increasingly recognized after lung transplantation,
is caused by donor-specific antibodies (DSA) to mismatched human leukocyte antigens (HLA) and frequently
results in CLAD and death. Recent multicenter studies using intensive monitoring for AMR report an incidence
over 25%. Treatment for AMR has generally focused on antibody-depletion and prevention of additional antibody
development. Various combinations have been used including high-dose corticosteroids, intravenous immune
globulin (IVIG), Rituximab, Carfilzomib, anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), and plasma exchange (PLEX). However,
there have been no randomized controlled trials to guide management, and outcomes after AMR are dismal.
One-year allograft survival after AMR is approximately 50%, and 2-year survival is only 20%. IL-6, initially
identified as B-cell stimulating factor 2 (BSF-2), is a pleiotropic cytokine that drives deleterious inflammatory,
alloimmune, and fibrogenic responses. In conjunction with other cytokines, IL-6 is responsible for normal
antibody production and is critical for the induction of follicular helper T-cells as well as the production of IL-21
which regulates immunoglobulin synthesis. IL-6 is also crucial for B-cell differentiation into plasmablasts and for
enhancing plasmablast survival. These characteristics make IL-6 an especially attractive cytokine to target in
the management of AMR. Human studies examining the role of IL-6 signaling blockade in the management of
AMR after kidney transplantation have shown promising results, even in refractory cases. We have used IL-6
signaling blockade in a very small number of lung transplant recipients with AMR at our center with encouraging
results. Our principal hypothesis is that IL-6 signaling blockade added to routine immunosuppressive treatment
for AMR would improve clinical outcomes. However, evaluating the safety of this approach is necessary before
examining efficacy in larger clinical trials because infections are the most common serious adverse events
associated with IL-6 signaling blockade and a common cause of death at all timepoints after lung transplantation.
Thus, we propose a Phase 1 clinical trial using Siltuximab, a monoclonal antibody to IL-6, in addition to routine
immunosuppressive therapy for AMR to examine safety and define the optimal dose for the treatment of AMR.
The primary endpoint is safety and tolerability, and secondary endpoints include pharmacodynamics and
functional biological measures relevant to AMR (e.g., DSA, cell-free DNA). Data from this trial will inform the
design of a future Phase 2 clinical trial that assesses efficacy. Carefully designed and implemented clinical trials
are necessary to improve outcomes after lung transplantation."
10885105,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Noise trauma can lead to loss of parvalbumin-positive inhibitory interneurons in the auditory cortex, which is
associated with audiotory processing deficit and tinnitus in rodent models. The mechanisms underlying noise-
induced PV neuron loss are unknown. We propose to systematically characterize noise-induced PV neuron
deficits and examine the hypothesis that differential activation of TNFR1 and TNFR2 in cortical PV neurons
determines the fate of the PV neurons following noise trauma, with TNFR1 biasing for, and TNFR2 biasing
against, neuronal loss and dysfunction.
Specific Aim 1. Examine cell death as a mechanism of noise-induced PV neuron loss. PV-Cre-tdTomato
mice will undergo a procedure to induce noise trauma. Auditory cortical tissue will be collected at four time
points (1, 3, 5 and 10 d later) to cover the entire cell death process. Sections of cortical tissue will be double
stained for PV and cell death markers (TUNEL staining for apoptosis, and antibody staining of p-RIP3 for
necroptosis). Colocalization of tdTomato (driven by a constitutively active promoter to mark all PV neurons
even if they stop expressing PV), PV and the cell death markers will be analyzed to quantify PV neuron death
vs. lack of PV.
Specific Aim 2. Characterize input and output synapses of the surviving cortical PV neurons following
noise trauma. PV-Cre-tdTomato and PV-Cre-ChR2-tdTomato mice will undergo the noise trauma procedure.
Ten days later, acute auditory cortical slices will be prepared. Patch clamp recording of PV neurons in PV-Cre-
tdTomato slices will be made, and excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs on PV neurons will be examined. In
addition, optogenetically activated PV neuron output onto Layer2/3 pyramidal neurons will be examined. The
input-output function, short-term plasticity, and synaptic depletion/recovery dynamics will be characterized. All
results will be compared between noise trauma and sham trauma groups.
Specific Aim 3. investigate the roles of TNFR1 and TNFR2 in noise-induced PV neuron loss and
synaptic dysfunction. We will knock down TNFR1 or TNFR2 in cortical PV neurons of PV-Cre-tdTomato and
PV-Cre-ChR2-tdTomato mice using our custom-made viral vectors for Cre-dependent expression of TNFR1 or
TNFR2 shRNA. The viral vector expresses GFP to allow comparison between transfected and untransfected
PV neurons. We will examine effects of TNFR1 or TNFR2 knockdown on noise-induced PV neuron loss (as in
Aim 1), synaptic dysfunction (as in Aim 2) and behavioral deficits (as in Masri et al., 20218)."

RESEARCH CAPACITY CORE
 Prostate cancer is the most common cancer type found in senior men and a second leading
cause of cancer deaths among American men. Although prostate cancer grows slowly, the major
cause of prostate cancer death results from cancer metastasis and chemoresistance. In
African­American men, the incidence of prostate cancer is 65% higher and the mortality rate is
more than double compared to Caucasian men. The cause for this racial disparity in both
incidence and death rate in African­Americans are ill­defined, but considerable evidence points
to roles for an array of biological and environmental factors. The Center for Cancer Research and
Therapeutic Development (CCRTD) at Clark Atlanta University (CAU) is committed to an ongoing
mission which is to advance our understanding of and ability to alter the pathogenesis and risk
factors associated with prostate cancer and its associated disparities through three research
projects and fifteen pilot projects in this renewed proposal. The Research Capacity Core at CAU
proposes to continue supporting rigorous, reproducible research in three ways: 1) Support
research projects by maintaining the core laboratories, core laboratory personnel and services
that will be utilized by the project leaders and other users of the core; 2) Provide training to ensure
that project leaders and other users are acquainted with the use of core equipment; and 3)
Enhance biomedical research capacity to allow projects leaders and other users of the core to
develop their research projects toward pre­clinical and/or clinical research."
10932347,"SUMMARY - Community Engagement Core
The goal of the Community Engagement Core (CEC) is to facilitate meaningful community involvement to ensure
effective and trusted bi-directional relationships between researchers, clinicians and community. Expanded use
of community-based participatory research (CBPR) has been noted as a “strategic imperative” to develop
effective interventions to address health disparities; it is an essential component of the research process. A
review of the history of earlier population-based studies, in both majority and minority populations, indicates that
requisite to a study's success is the comprehensive involvement of the study population's Community.
Community engagement strives to create action around community values, concerns and aspirations. It
formulates a platform for the establishment of effective, communicative partnerships that develop and shape
services and initiatives based on the community’s priorities and values. Through feedback, community
engagement also enables government and public decision-making stakeholders to listen and, in turn,
demonstrate the impact of community contribution. Overall, community engagement then builds deeper, stronger
and more trusting relationships between academicians, healthcare professionals, public organizations and
communities. The CEC will leverage the infrastructure and community networks established by Xavier and the
Louisiana Clinical and Translational Science (LACaTS) Center’s Community Engagement and Outreach
Resource (CEOR) Core, which Xavier leads. The CEC will embark on successful and impactful community
engagement strategies and activities by addressing three specific aims. Aim 1. Promote and sustain community-
academic partnerships through bidirectional knowledge sharing and community involvement to ensure that
intervention strategies and scientific discovery in health disparities are relevant to community needs and are
translated into community knowledge and practice. Aim 2. Build research and learning capacity among research
investigators, clinicians, community members, health systems, and potential research participants to conduct
innovative and transformative research projects to address community health needs, particularly in cancer
research and health disparities. Aim 3. Provide support for investigators in developing appropriate strategies to
facilitate dissemination of research findings of the center to the scientific and community organizations, and lay
communities. To effectively engage and communicate with the community, CEC will employ the CBPR principles
and methods in ensuring the needs of the community are ascertained and addressed through research, health
promotion and education. CEC will serve as a liaison between (1) investigators and community – fostering and
nurturing a bi-directional relationship between academic researchers and community; and (2) internal (Xavier)
and external (LACaTs) investigators – for the purpose of collaborative research and mentorship. The CEC’s
established trusted and sustainable relationships with vulnerable communities will ensure its involvement in the
engagement continuum (Outreach, Consult, Involve, Collaborate, and Shared Leadership)."
10932350,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) are the largest source of added sugar in the diets of children and are
associated with childhood obesity. SSB consumption is disproportionately high among low-income, minority
children. As of 2022, 29 jurisdictions in the United States (US) have passed laws requiring restaurants to offer
healthy default beverages (HDBs; i.e., water, milk, 100% juice) with children’s meals with the goal of reducing
SSB consumption and obesity among children. Yet, effectiveness, factors that impact implementation, and
equitable reach of these policies have not been fully studied. Addressing this gap, we propose to evaluate the
Healthy Kids’ Beverage Menu Ordinance passed in New Orleans, Louisiana. New Orleans, located in the state
with the third-highest prevalence of childhood obesity, is the first city in the Southern US to enact such a policy.
This proposal presents a study of the implementation process, effectiveness, and reach of the ordinance in a
region of the United States with some of the highest rates of childhood obesity. The project is guided by the RE-
AIM/PRISM framework, using approaches from implementation science to contextualize the ordinance’s reach
and effectiveness, including its influence on health equity. Using a prospective, quasi-experimental design, we
will determine changes in default beverage offerings with children’s meals, restaurant compliance, and
populations reached through a controlled, difference-in-difference analysis of children’s menus in a random
sample of restaurants in New Orleans and the comparison city of Baton Rouge before policy implementation and
18 and 30 months after enactment (Aim 1). We will also measure the effect of the ordinance on children’s
beverage purchases as part of restaurant meals by analyzing the amount of SSBs and calories from SSBs
purchased for children residing in New Orleans, compared to purchases for children in the comparison city 18
and 30 months after policy implementation (Aim 2). To contextualize the outcomes, we will define contextual
and restaurant-level factors influencing policy implementation and effectiveness by conducting a qualitative,
longitudinal assessment of the design, implementation, and sustainability of the policy using in-depth interviews
with restaurant staff and key policy stakeholders along with an ongoing document review, covering the pre-
implementation period through 36-months after implementation (Aim 3). Our team is collecting baseline data
related to Aims 1 and 2, and initial documents for Aim 3. The proposed study will make a significant contribution
to our understanding of how policies influence food environments for obesity prevention among children. The
ability to explore the HDB ordinance over time will provide important insights for lawmakers that may inform
future policy design to improve effectiveness. The project will also offer a critical regional perspective to this
growing body of research at a location with great need and identify the impact of health-promoting legislative
efforts on children at highest risk for obesity and diet-related health disparities. Further, this research will build
institutional research capacity, develop early-stage investigators, and facilitate research partnerships."
10932354,"Project Summary
The American Cancer Society estimates that 238,000 Americans will be diagnosed with lung
cancer in 2023 and over 127,000 Americans will die of lung cancer complications. Non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for the vast majority (~82%) of all lung cancer diagnoses and can
be caused by a number of distinct mechanisms. One such mechanism is an inversion of part of
Chromosome 2p that leads to the fusion of the tyrosine kinase domain of the Anaplastic
Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) gene with coiled-coil domain of echinoderm microtubule-associated
protein-like 4 gene (EML4), leading to a soluble, dimerized, constitutively active tyrosine kinase.
While a series of competitive ALK inhibitors have been approved by the FDA in the last decade,
spontaneous suppressor mutations in the ALK active site limit their efficacy, with median duration
of response of 11 months. Rather than continue to develop ALK inhibitors, we have developed a
series of proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) to induce the degradation of the EML4-ALK
protein. These heterobifunctional PROTACs are small molecules that contain an EML4-ALK
targeting motif, a flexible linker, and a ligand that recruits an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This complex
induces the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation of the target protein.
In cellular assays, we see that our early stage PROTACs induce degradation of transformed,
NSCLC-causing EML4-ALK fusions, as well as EML4-ALK with suppressor mutations that block
the efficacy of currently approved therapeutics. Importantly, we observe EML4-ALK degradation
for concentrations at or lower than those used for current inhibitors. In the initial stages of this
proposal, we will perform iterative synthesis and testing of additional PROTAC molecules to
increase both their selectivity and effectiveness in in vitro and cellular studies. Once we have
obtained the most promising candidates for further development, we will test them for a
comprehensive set of pharmaceutical criteria including desirable ADME and safety pharmacology
profile, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, in vivo efficacy, and oral bioavailability.
PROTACs that meet such criteria will then be tested in clinically relevant xenograft ALK-positive
NSCLC tumor models to evaluate in vivo efficacy and pharmacodynamics, as well as additional
ADME and PK studies. This work will develop a first-in class, orally active ALK degrader that can
be used for patients that have become resistant to first-line inhibitor treatment. In addition, ALK
degraders have the potential to be used as a first-line treatment as well, since they have already
shown efficacy in degrading non-resistant forms of EML4-ALK fusions."
10932357,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT – PROJECT 3
The expanded role of pharmacists in the pandemic was demonstrated as both frontline workers
in testing and vaccination efforts and clinicians both on the frontline and in remote, telehealth
capacities. The impact of a telehealth model on all vaccine uptake, with a target of COVID-19
vaccine uptake, among vaccine hesitant and vaccine resistant individuals is yet unknown
among health disparity communities. The objective of this proposal to assess the effectiveness
of a pharmacist led telehealth intervention model, embedded in a general health and wellness
model on COVID-19 and influenza vaccine uptake in underserved, high risk communities. The
central hypothesis is that, based upon our preliminary data from on our ongoing research, that
individuals in high risk industries such as beauty, food, transportation, hospitality, nursing/
medical aids and plant workers, all of whom were disproportionately impacted by COVID-19,
are less likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine and influenza vaccines. Also, an established
pharmacist led telehealth model that delivers a vaccine education in a larger health and
wellness model will increase vaccine uptake, specifically COVID-19 vaccine uptake. The
central hypothesis will be tested by 1) assessing vaccine hesitancy via an intake form among
eligible participants, 2) implementing an individualized randomized group treatment trial approach
where participants will be randomized to the control (telehealth wellness) vs the intervention
(telehealth with wellness and vaccination education) over two years. The primary outcome will
be COVID-19 vaccine uptake with a secondary outcome of influenza vaccines uptake and
vaccine hesitancy. The proposed research is significant because it will determine the
effectiveness of pharmacists, who are considered among the most accessible healthcare
professionals, and telehealth on increasing vaccinations. The expected outcomes are there will
be a 15% increase in vaccine acceptance in the intervention group. The results will have a
positive impact in communities that experience vaccine disparities and will serve to inform other
healthcare professionals on how to incorporate vaccine education in current telehealth visits.
This project will lay the groundwork for a tested vaccine education model to be incorporated in
telehealth models that can be delivered to high-risk individuals with decreased access to care
and increased risk for COVID-19 and other vaccine preventable diseases, such as influenza. It
will also impact the role of pharmacists as the intervention model will be offered through
Xavier’s continuing education efforts to prepare pharmacists for their continuing expanding role
as vaccine ambassadors."
10836558,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The long-term arc of this project is expected to engineer vascularization of tissue deficits and advance
treatment of microvascular diseases including myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, pulmonary arterial
hypertension, aneurysm, peripheral artery disease, bone repair, volumetric muscle loss, diabetic wounds, and
cancer. To achieve this goal, the project will advance our fundamental understanding of how local fibrous
extracellular matrix (ECM) biophysical cues dynamically influence pericytes during neovessel formation. The
role of the endothelial cell in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis is well recognized, yet the pericyte’s full scope
of work is less understood, despite its known essential role in proper vascular development. We made a
surprising observation that pericytes exhibit phenotypic plasticity when they spontaneously assemble into 3D
spheroids and reversibly form and adopt endothelial markers when cultured on native and synthetic fibrous
biomaterials in vitro, but not on 2D substrates. Akin to vasculogenic blood islands, tip cell-like protrusions
sprout and retract from these spheroids comprised of pericytes that transdifferentiate to express endothelial
markers. Other studies by our team revealed that matrix fiber diameter and architecture dictate cell
morphology, the mode and rate of cell migration, cell force exertion, protrusion dynamics, and nuclear shape
associated with heterochromatic rearrangements. These published and preliminary studies gave rise to a
central hypothesis that various matrix biophysical parameters differentially direct neovessel formation by
modulating pericyte migration, contraction, protrusion, and phenotypic plasticity. To test this hypothesis, we will
further develop a nanofiber cell force sensing platform to mimic (patho)physiological ECMs through exquisite
tunable control of ECM fiber biophysical parameters (e.g., diameter, density, alignment). With consideration of
disease-simulating biochemical milieu (e.g., oxygen tension, reactive oxygen species, and inflammatory
cytokines), experiments performed under Aim 1 will identify how matrix biophysical cues alter pericyte
migration, contractility, and protrusion dynamics. Aim 2 experiments will develop the in vitro nanofiber scaffold
system to selectively transplant patterned spheroids in vivo for neovessel formation through engineered control
of pericyte plasticity and transdifferentiation. The project’s translational impact will be novel methods of
controlling microvascular expansion and regression in diseased, damaged, and engineered tissues."

The DNAJC protein family (DNAJC5-26) is a subclass of co-chaperones that has attracted recent attention due
to the identification of mutations that are linked with parkinsonism. Here, we focus on DNAJC13, which encodes
Receptor-Mediated Endocytosis 8 (RME8), a co-chaperone that facilitates membrane recycling and cargo sorting
of endocytosed proteins. RME8 is primarily localized at the early endosome membrane which serves as a
switchboard for protein and membrane traffic. In Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients, different mutations of RME8
have been identified, however, more evidence are needed to understand the roles of RME8 in Parkinsonism in
vivo. Our proposal will systematically evaluate the 1) behavioral, 2) pathological and 3) cellular changes in novel
RME8 mouse models, as a function of age, and determine if they replicate PD features. Our objective is to define
the functions of RME8 in Parkinsonism and identify points of therapeutic intervention for PD."
10813206,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Best estimates suggest up to 68% of child welfare cases involve a caregiver with an alcohol and/or other
substance use disorder (AOSUDs), which is a significant public health problem given that in 2020 alone there
were 3.9 million child welfare referrals involving 7.1 million children! Child welfare professionals lack knowledge
of AOSUDs and their evidence-based treatments and many caregivers’ AOSUDs go unidentified and
untreated, which puts children at greater risk for maltreatment and out-of-home placements. To address this
issue, the proposed training program seeks funding to enhance Virginia Commonwealth University’s (VCU)
federally-supported Title IV-E child welfare professional training program with specialized training on AOSUDs
integrated with an ongoing clinical/peer supervision and a tele-education (ECHO) model. Project aims include:
(a) to recruit 30 child welfare professionals who are alumni of VCU’s Title IV-E child welfare program to
participate in a two-year specialized training program; (b) to assess the impact of the program on caseworker
skill and confidence in screening, intervening, and referring child-welfare involved families impacted by
AOSUDs; and (c) to identify barriers and facilitators to the effective implementation of AOSUD training in child
welfare settings. Without enhanced training programs such as the one proposed here, child welfare
professionals will continue to lack the education and support they need to address AOSUDs among the
majority of families and children involved in the child welfare system. With almost 150 Title IV-E programs
across 35 states, the findings from this innovative training program will inform the development of an evidence-
based program that can be replicated to improve child welfare outcomes across the country."
10876925,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prevalent and costly mental health disorder associated with poorer
health and higher healthcare utilization. These outcomes are a particular concern among Veterans, who have
higher rates of PTSD compared to civilian populations. Veterans with PTSD, for example, are twice as likely to
experience premature death compared to Veterans without PTSD. How might PTSD affect health? Recent
studies have shown that PTSD can accelerate biological aging—i.e., the rate at which people evidence gradual
physiological decline consistent with chronological aging. Accelerated aging is theorized to result in more
disability, disease, and premature death and could explain why Veterans with PTSD are at greater risk of poor
health.
There is great promise in slowing aging to prevent ill health, but methods of assessing biological aging have
been constrained by long and costly data collection, limiting effective application to clinical settings. Recent
methods have shown the potential to use markers of DNA methylation to calculate the speed at which people
are aging using biomarkers collected at a single point in time. This novel methodology could provide the
opportunity to identify and treat Veterans who are at risk of rapid aging—such as those with PTSD—years
before poor health develops. These findings could help promote the importance and uptake of PTSD treatment
among both Veterans and healthcare providers, reducing healthcare costs and human suffering. Doing so,
however, would require applying these methods in Veteran samples and empirically validating this approach.
This Research Plan proposes to examine the links between PTSD, accelerated aging, and later health. The
main hypotheses guiding this work are that Veterans with PTSD will evidence accelerated aging, and this
accelerated aging will be associated with poorer health 5 years later. A further goal will be to test whether
candidate psychosocial characteristics— higher social support, fewer comorbid mental health disorders,
positive health behaviors, and treatment for PTSD—might protect against accelerated aging for Veterans with
PTSD. Specific Aims—Aim 1: Examine whether Veterans with PTSD have accelerated biological aging.
Aim 2: Test whether accelerated biological aging predicts Veterans’ midlife health over the subsequent
5 years. Aim 3: Determine whether candidate psychosocial characteristics are associated with slower
aging and better midlife health for Veterans with PTSD. These aims will be achieved using existing data
from the Post-Deployment Mental Health (PDMH) study, a multi-site cohort of Afghanistan and Iraq era
Veterans. PDMH data, including methylation data used to derived biological aging scores, will be linked to
health outcomes in the VA electronic health record (EHR). This study will help determine whether Veterans
with PTSD have accelerated biological aging compared to Veterans without PTSD, as well as if accelerated
aging predicts poorer Veteran health. This study will provide the first evidence that biological aging explains
how PTSD results in poor Veteran health, as well as what psychosocial characteristics could be targeted by
intervention to slow aging. The results of these aims will be used to support a Merit Review award submission
proposing to examine change in biological aging following behavioral intervention for Veterans with PTSD.
The Training and Mentoring plans outline the professional development, training, and mentorship activities that
will support the applicant’s development as an early-career investigator in the VA. Specifically, the Training and
Mentoring plans will extend the applicant’s methodological expertise to include DNA methylation measures of
biological aging in Veteran populations with PTSD, expanding the applicant’s expertise in using VA EHR health
data, and support the applicant’s long-term career goal of using interventions to improve the health of Veterans
with PTSD. The ongoing mentorship and support the applicant will receive during the CDA-2 award period and
beyond will help his development as a Research Health Scientist at the Durham VAMC."

10888269,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) kills 1 in 3 individuals and affects >2 in 3 individuals diagnosed with type 2
diabetes (T2D). Despite optimization of available therapies, CVD remains the leading cause of mortality in
T2D, highlighting the considerable burden of residual risk. Achieving further reduction in CVD morbidity and
mortality in people with T2D requires advancing promising candidate mediators of residual risk. The metabolite
α-aminoadipic acid (2-AAA) predicts the development of both T2D and atherosclerosis, independent of other
known risk factors. This may represent a novel independent risk mechanism for the development of CVD,
particularly among individuals with T2D. Our overarching hypothesis is that 2-AAA is an independent mediator
of CVD risk among individuals with T2D. In the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD)
trial, both intensive glucose-lowering therapy, and intensive lipid management failed to attenuate CVD risk in
individuals with T2D, and indeed showed evidence of increased risk. We hypothesize this was, in part, due to
residual risk factors, including 2-AAA. We propose an analysis of 2-AAA in existing plasma samples from
N=1,757 participants of the ACCORD study lipid treatment arms, with the following aims: 1) Define the effects
of lipid- and glucose-lowering therapies on plasma 2-AAA, and address whether plasma 2-AAA changes in
response to lipid-targeted therapy or intensive glycemic management. 2) Address the hypothesis that plasma
2-AAA is a CVD risk mechanism among individuals who experienced events despite optimal therapy.
Successful completion of the aims will determine whether 2-AAA levels are impacted by lipid and glycemic
management in T2D and establish whether elevated 2-AAA associates with CVD risk. This will provide
important information on the utility of 2-AAA as a biomarker of risk and plausibility as a novel therapeutic
target, allowing us to refine specific hypotheses to be probed in future studies. These aims represent novel and
important questions and use existing NHLBI-supported sample and data resources to add considerable
scientific value and address a key knowledge gap."
10933418,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Proper positioning of intracellular cargos (organelles, vesicles, and macromolecules) is critical for cell growth,
maturation, and survival. Eukaryotic cells use the molecular motors dynein and kinesin to transport cargos along
microtubule tracks. Defects in microtubule-based transport and mutations in the motors themselves, are an
underlying feature of many neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. Since each type of cargo is
tuned for specific cellular functions, their loading, movement and unloading along microtubules requires
divergent transport mechanisms. How is cargo specificity on microtubules achieved? This proposal will address
this with an in-depth analysis of the two major modes of microtubule-based transport. The canonical view, known
as the cargo adaptor mode, is that each cargo interacts with specific adaptor proteins capable of recruiting
molecular motors. The regulatory mechanisms by which cargos selectively load and unload from these cargo
adaptors are not well understood. One goal of this proposal is to determine how a conserved phosphorylation
site on vesicle-bound Rab GTPases affects interactions with dynein cargo adaptors and ultimately, how these
interactions affect cellular function. Importantly, this Rab phosphorylation site is the predominant target of the
Parkinson’s disease-linked kinase LRRK2. The other mode of transport is called organelle hitchhiking. In
hitchhiking, Rab-vesicles can direct the movement of organelles on microtubules. To accomplish this, organelles
attach to (or ‘hitchhike’ on) motor-driven Rab-vesicles at membrane contact sites. Organelle hitchhiking is a new,
relatively unexplored paradigm of microtubule-based transport, and the underlying molecular mechanisms are
not well understood. What are the molecular linkers, tethers, and regulators of organelle hitchhiking? Is this a
prominent mode of microtubule-based transport? This proposal will use genetics, microscopy, and biochemistry
in both fungal and mammalian model systems to address these questions. Taken together, studying the two
main modes of microtubule-based transport is extremely important, given the critical roles Rabs, vesicles, and
hitchhiking cargos play in development and age-related diseases."
10916265,"This SPiRE provides the opportunity to raise the technical expertise of the PI (Barrett), and
provide a critical missing element for personalized rehabilitation care in spatial neglect (SN), a
disabling cognitive deficit causing asymmetric 3-D spatial action, movement, perception and
awareness. For more than 10 years, the PI and colleagues addressed SN by extensively
characterizing neuropsychological deficits, documenting the adverse impact on function and
freedom, and developing feasible SN rehabilitation protocols. Their research reported ~80% SN
underdiagnosis and undertreatment; improving this care delivery gap is certain to reduce the
devastating personal and social losses associated with SN. Here, the PI moves from her past
work advancing dissemination, implementation, and rehabilitation to gain neuroimaging skills
and pursue a new, biological approach to improving SN care delivery. The PI and colleagues
discovered that the Aiming SN subtype, associated with motor-intentional deficits, predicts rapid
improvement of daily life function with early rehabilitation. However, Aiming SN is difficult to
identify on typical behavioral screening. Unlike other SN subtypes, however, Aiming SN is
strongly associated with specific neuroanatomic features: frontal lobe disconnection. In this
study, supported by experts in studying white matter disruption in SN (Carter), white matter
disruption as a predictor of stroke rehabilitation outcomes (Cramer), and novel brain imaging
(Qiu), the PI will develop a new process of SN diagnosis based on brain imaging biomarkers.
The team will develop brain imaging biomarkers associated with Aiming SN, using 4 advanced
imaging procedures, and demonstrate that these biomarkers can predict daily life function
improvement at 3 months and 6 months post-stroke (Aim 1). The experts supporting the PI have
experience with rapidly translating biomarker analyses to clinical imaging data, and thus the
SPiRE will also include a direct comparison of advanced imaging (high-resolution and diffusivity)
versus clinically-acquired data (Aim 2). The team will directly compare the biomarkers derived
from research imaging, with those derived from clinical imaging, to identify Aiming SN. They will
also test the relative ability of research versus clinical biomarkers to predict functional
independence at 3 and 6 months. At the next research step, armed with a potential biomarker
for Aiming SN and for functional gains with SN rehabilitation, our team will propose a larger,
multi-site study for biomarker validation. Our long-term goal is to lead SN research toward
routinely identifying affected veterans, and rapidly providing personalized cognitive
rehabilitation, to improve functional outcomes for veterans with stroke in the community."

Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to an infection. Due to
improved acute survival following sepsis, many patients develop chronic critical illness (CCI), defined as
prolonged hospitalization with unresolved organ dysfunction. CCI frequently manifests as a persistent
inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome (PICS). Sepsis survivors suffering from PICS have
highly variable poor long-term outcomes, especially regarding muscle weakness, which manifests as atrophy,
delays recovery, and leads to physical disability. Although we have demonstrated that sepsis leads to physical
disability, which warrants interventions to prevent it, the majority of exercise training and nutritional clinical trials
have been ineffective to prevent functional decline. A key deficiency of trials to date has been a “one size fits all”
approach to intervention, ignoring any heterogeneity in patient populations (age, sex, and race/ethnicity). To
develop precision medicine (or interventions), we need a better understanding of the contribution of age, sex,
and race/ethnicity, and immunologically active peripheral organs to sepsis-induced physical disability. Part of
this precision approach includes the gut microbiome. The gut microbiome uniquely affects host immune status,
depends on biological variables, and interacts with and controls end-organ function such as skeletal muscle.
Gut-microbiome dysbiosis is known to play a role in the overall pathology of sepsis and may be a driver of PICS
and sepsis-induced acute and long-term muscle loss/weakness and physical disability. The Principal Investigator
(PI) has demonstrated that older age is associated with worse clinical trajectories, long-term muscle-strength
and physical-function outcomes, and has revealed that older adults have greater aberrations of the PICS
biomarkers compared to younger individuals. The PI has also shown persistent gut-microbiome dysbiosis in
sepsis patients and that gut microbiome differs between ages and sexes in a preclinical animal sepsis model.
Given the current findings, the overarching goal for this application is to characterize the role of age, sex,
race/ethnicity, and gut microbiome in the development of PICS leading to sepsis-induced muscle loss/weakness
and physical disability. The goal of the PI laboratory’s research program over the next 5 years is to characterize
(1) sepsis-induced chronic muscle loss/weakness and physical disability in sepsis survivors; (2) the role of PICS
pathophysiology; (3) the effects of sex, age, and race/ethnicity on PICS and the development of physical
disability; and (4) the unique contribution of the gut microbiome to heterogeneity of PICS and physical disability.
Characterizing the heterogeneity of chronic sepsis-induced muscle loss/weakness and physical disability and
creating patient profiles at risk of developing physical disability will be the key to applying precision medicine to
prevent physical disability. Based on the findings of this study, future interventions can be customized to
particular patients in terms of appropriate timing, type, and modality of exercise training and/or gut-function-
enhancing treatments to prevent physical disability in an expanding population of chronically ill sepsis survivors."
10915497,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Only 2 in 8 young adults (age 18-30 years) with type 1 diabetes (T1D) achieve glycemic targets (A1C < 7.0%).
In well-controlled lab studies sleep deprivation impairs glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, a reduces acute
insulin response to glucose, impairs body weight regulation (lower leptin, higher ghrelin), and impairs alertness
in young adults without chronic conditions and decreases insulin sensitivity in middle-aged adults with T1D.
Using cognitive-behavioral approaches to sleep by 1 hour over 6 weeks to 12 months in natural environments is
feasible and contributes to improvements in insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, and general distress symptoms
in young adults without chronic conditions and improved time in glucose range in adolescents with T1D. Sleep
duration, regularity, and timing are modifiable targets that may improve glycemia and other important diabetes
self-management outcomes in young adults with T1D. Here we leverage our preliminary findings in the proposed
study to advance cognitive-behavioral sleep self-management for T1D (K99/R00NR018886). We propose to
enroll 248 young adults ages 18-30 years with T1D (50% female, 40% underrepresented) who are not achieving
glycemic targets (A1C ≥ 7%). The goals of this study are two-fold: (1) to compare the immediate and short-term
effects of a 3-month cognitive-behavioral sleep self-management intervention (CB-sleep) versus enhanced usual
care (time-balanced attention control) on sleep health dimensions and glycemia and (2) to determine whether
sleep health mediates the associations between the intervention and control condition over 9 months (baseline
to 3 months and 6 and 9 months post baseline). We will randomize 1:1 to the CB-sleep or enhanced usual care
condition (time balanced attention control). Sleep health dimensions will be rigorously measured using validated
tools: regularity (actigraphy and self-report), satisfaction (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information
System Sleep Disturbance), alertness (Epworth Sleepiness), timing, efficiency, and duration (actigraphy and
self-report). Glycemia will be determined by A1C (primary outcome) with subgroup analyses of glucose
variability/glucose percentage time in range 70-180 mg/dL (via continuous glucose monitors or self-monitored
blood glucose six times daily). Data will be analyzed using multivariate techniques, and efficacy will be
determined."

Chronic postoperative pain affects a small but significant surgery population. The goal of this project is to
preclinically translate and determine the overall contribution of altered sex hormone levels in vulnerable patient
populations. These studies will generate novel preclinical sex hormone-altered pharmacological models. This
project may identify new insights into those susceptible to developing chronic postoperative pain as well as a
greater understanding into underlying genetic and genomic mechanisms.
 Although many individuals with underlying altered sex hormone levels undergo surgical procedures,
most preclinical studies do not attempt to address this highly relevant patient population. As it is well
documented that sex hormones play pivotal roles in pain development and maintenance, this is striking. In
particular, the role of basally altered sex hormones in gonad-intact preclinical post-surgical pain models is
relatively unknown and understudied. Furthermore, the genome-wide and tissue-specific genetic changes that
sex hormone alterations may produce before, during, and after surgery have yet to be elucidated. Precise
manipulation of hormone levels to establish chronic post-surgical pain causation is not possible in humans. To
identify targets for improved post-surgical recovery we will therefore take advantage of a clinically informed sex
hormone altered rodent models as well as validated behavioral endpoints. Our central hypothesis is that within
vulnerable patient populations, sex hormone alterations occur, contribute to changes in mood, and both sex
hormone alterations and mood changes predispose those vulnerable individuals towards post-surgical chronic
pain. To pursue this fundamental work, we will use a combination of molecular and whole organism
approaches in which I have significant expertise including mouse models of incisional surgery, pain-evoked
and pain-depressed behavioral readouts, as well as examination of fold-changes related to both the genome
and specific tissues. This convergence of capabilities uniquely positions my independent laboratory to answer
key knowledge gaps: 1) Sex hormones are critical in the development and maintenance of chronic pain, but
can pharmacological modulation be monitored in vivo via pharmacokinetic measures to identify correlative
pain-related behaviors? 2) What specific genetic alterations occur due to sex hormone alterations? 3) Are the
sex hormone alterations seen within the surgical patient population relevant to the use and potency of post-
surgical analgesics? Ultimately, these studies will establish how sex hormone alterations may influence post-
surgical pain recovery. Successful completion of the proposed studies may enhance our understanding of sex
hormone alterations within vulnerable patient populations, and the role of sex hormones on healing after
surgery, identify associated -omics related changes, and clarify analgesic treatment options."

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a type of breast cancer that does not express the estrogen
receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)
protein which accounts for 15–20 % of all breast cancer cases. TNBC tumors are generally larger, are
of higher grade, and are more aggressive than other breast cancer types. TNBC is unlikely to respond
to hormonal therapy medicines, including tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors. TNBC also is unlikely to
respond to medicines that target the HER2 protein, such as Herceptin (trastuzumab). Treatment of
TNBC patients has been challenging due to the lack of molecular targets. Therefore, there is a critical
unmet need to develop more effective therapies for TNBC and drug-resistant breast cancers. The
development of new treatments would require radically different approaches that rely on enzymatic
reactions specific to TNBC cells rather than the cell receptors.
This proposal hypothesizes that properly designed peptide substrates of Eyes Absent enzyme (EYA)
can selectively inhibit TNBC cell growth by a self-assembling process. The central hypothesis is that
tyrosine phosphatase activity of EYA in TNBC could specifically convert the peptide therapeutics into
nanofibers and induce controlled apoptosis of TNBC cells. The preliminary data suggested that a
modified sequence of peptides with only one added amino acid could be de-phosphorylated by EYA
and self-assemble into nanostructures to inhibit the growth of TNBC cells (MDA-MB-231). In this
project, different peptide substrates of EYA will be synthesized by changing variable factors and the
correlation of structure to enzyme activity and cell apoptosis will be determined by focusing on the
following aims:
Aim 1: Design and synthesize self-assembling peptide substrates for EYA enzymes; Aim 2:
Determining the efficacy of peptide substrates for inhibiting TNBC in spheroid 3D cell cultures.
The correlation between the enzyme kinetic and the activity of nanostructures for targeting EYA will
be evaluated. Aim 3: The apoptosis response of the TNBC cells will be determined. This study will
lead to finding the potent peptide substrate and the effective dose for inhibiting TNBC cells with
apoptosis cell death."
10861039,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Heart failure is associated with activation of cardiac fibroblasts (Fib), which promotes cardiac fibrosis and
pathological cardiac remodeling. Employing single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) in adult mouse hearts, we
discovered that Enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), the major enzyme known to catalyze the transcriptional
repression mark H3K27me3, is highly expressed in a specific POSTN+ Fib subpopulation (myofibroblasts, MFib).
Of note, little is known about the functional role of EZH2 in regulating cardiac MFib, which is a critical knowledge
gap given their epigenetic variability and pathological role. We demonstrate that although these MFib express
GATA4, an early cardiac transcription factor, they fail to express the cardiovascular progenitor (CPC) gene
programs, such as NKX2.5. Importantly, deletion of EZH2 inhibited MFib proliferation and switched on
cardiovascular progenitor cell (CPC) gene programs. Moreover, deletion of EZH2 increased the pro-angiogenic
paracrine effects of MFib and improved cardiac function post myocardial infarction (MI) These beneficial effects
on cardiac function were lost in mice administered a novel rAAV-FLEX-DTA vector, which ablates MFib lacking
EZH2, confirming the important functional role of this cell population. These findings suggest that EZH2 is a
restraint on the transition of MFib to beneficial phenotypes and that inhibition of EZH2 provides a unique
therapeutic approach to diminishing MFib proliferation while activating repair mechanisms. The overall goal of
this project is to test the central hypothesis that EZH2 inhibition in myofibroblasts can transform the cell fate
from pro-fibrotic myofibroblasts into pro-angiogenic CPC, thus attenuating fibrosis, improving cardiac
angiogenesis, and boosting cardiac repair in the ischemic myocardium. This proposed project is innovative
because it will generate unique mechanistic insights from novel approaches to cardiac regeneration by
transforming cardiac myofibroblasts from a proliferative and pro-fibrotic phenotype to a pro-angiogenic and pro-
regenerative phenotype. Our focus on EZH2-mediated chromatin remodeling in epigenetic repression of
GATA4-mediated CPC program is translationally significant, as EZH2 inhibitors are available clinically and have
recently been approved for the treatment of follicular lymphoma. Our preliminary findings highlight the potential
for this pathway to be the focus of novel strategies for mitigating cardiac fibrosis and promoting cardiac
angiogenesis after ischemic injury."

Biomolecular phase separation is a fundamental process in biology which facilitates many biological functions.
Through the process of phase separation, cells can compartmentalize certain molecules into a highly-
concentrated condensed phase – commonly termed a condensate, or membraneless organelle (MLO) – that is
distinct from the surrounding environment. These MLOs are important to biology because they are functionally
distinct from their membrane-bound counterparts, and can be regulated by external stimuli, sometimes forming
or dissociating spontaneously upon a change in conditions in the surroundings. Usually, MLOs are stabilized by
a small subset of molecules, such as multivalent proteins containing intrinsically disordered regions, but contain
dozens to hundreds of other proteins, nucleic acids, and other molecules. It is important to understand the
physics and molecular interactions that determine the relative composition, and how this relates to the function
and efficiency of an MLO. This is especially important for development of novel drugs that target proteins and
nucleic acids within disease-causing condensates in biology. I plan to develop my research program to tackle
important problems in this field by developing theoretical models to describe interactions and phase separation
of multi-component mixtures of proteins and other biomolecules. Successful completion of this work will enable
researchers to make predictions of how biomolecules contribute to phase separation in a multi-component
system. We will also work to understand how MLOs are regulated by cellular conditions such as temperature,
pH, or concentration of salt and other small molecules. We particularly wish to focus on the question of how
phase separation is controlled by the presence of small molecules, such as metabolites, or pharmaceutical
drugs. By working with theoretical and computational methods, we can consistently model the interactions of
small molecules with MLO constituents, and how they partition inside a condensate. Successful completion of
this work will contribute greatly to the community's understanding of how condensates are regulated and provide
important design principles for small molecule, and biologic drugs developed specifically to target MLOs."
10904958,"Project summary:
In the human body, the small molecule chemical space originates from 1) the exposome( natural or synthetic
exogenous compounds) and the metabolome (functional readout of metabolic pathways of host and
commensal microbiota genomes). Studying this chemical space has provided new insights into the initiation
and progression of cancer, neurological, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and biomarkers for
exposures to industrial chemicals, nutrients, drugs and bioactive internal molecules. Targeted biomonitoring
and untargeted chemical analysis assays generate core datasets for exposomics projects to study the
chemical space and its impact on human health. Inter-chemical correlations are ubiquitously observed in these
core datasets. However, interpretation of these correlations has been limited to metabolic pathway and
reaction contexts which do not cover the origin, source, transformation and interaction among exposome
chemicals. We propose to develop the Exposome Correlation and Interpretation Database (ECID), a new
biomedical knowledgebase that will systematically catalogue and curate inter-chemical correlations and their
interpretation for the core datasets in exposomics. ECID will have three main informatics resources 1)
Chemical Correlation Database (CCDB), a curated, trustworthy, and FAIR compliance database of inter-
chemical correlations from biomonitoring and untargeted chemical analysis assays (aim1). In the prototype
version, 56 datasets have been included and by end of the project, over 250 datasets (human-only) will be
covered by the CCDB. We will curate the inter-chemical correlations that are observed across multiple studies.
2) Exposome Data Interpretation Resource (EDIR), an integrated database of structural and functional
relationships among chemicals (aim 2). Aim 2 will utilize text mining, cheminformatics, database fusion,
ontologies and chemical network mapping methods to create an atlas of functional and structural relationships
among exposome chemicals. EDIR will be used for annotating curated inter-chemical correlations with
plausible interpretations. and 3) Exposome WorkSpace, an online space to explore the CCDB and EDIR
information and to interpret user-provided datasets (aim 3). We will re-engineer the established data
exploration and analytics methods to provide an integrated, focused and relevant framework for exploring inter-
chemical correlations in core exposomics datasets. ECID portal will provide self-guided tutorials and online
data exploration tools for the exposomics and metabolomics researchers. ECID will leverage and complement
the HHEAR program's data center, targeted and untargeted laboratory components at the Mount Sinai
Exposomics Hub. We will utilize HHEAR studies (post-embargo) as validation studies to showcase the
application of ECID in exposome research. ECID will make significant contributions towards expanding our
understanding about small molecules chemical space within the human body by revealing exposure chemical's
health effects, new metabolic and xenobiotic transformation pathways, and exposure groups."
10933412,"Many cellular processes use phase separation to sequesters biomolecules into membraneless organelles
or condensates. This concept is of particular importance in the cell nucleus. Most nuclear condensates
are associated with specific chromatin loci. Thus, chromatin organization and biomolecular condensate
formation are closely related. Topology, epigenetic modification, or enzymatic activity are possible links
between the chromatin scaffold and protein condensation. We have previously described condensates
that concentrate transcription machinery at super-enhancers but understanding of cell-to-cell variability
and locus specific features that nucleate condensates is missing. Preliminary data indicates that active
chromatin decorates the surface of transcription condensates below the resolution limit of conventional
microscopy. Making use of recent developments in multiplexed super-resolution microscopy of both
chromatin elements and protein factors, we will characterize the nature of the chromatin enrichment
layer and determine if it reflects the condensate surface as an active interface that regulates
transcription. We will for the first time directly observe the interplay of local chromatin topology,
epigenetic signatures, and condensate formation in a specific model locus in mouse embryonic stem
cells. By scrutinizing with genomic resolution how each of the regulatory elements in the locus interacts
with the condensate we will determine if chromatin structures such as enhancer hubs nucleate
condensates, or if condensates induce specific chromatin topologies by connecting active elements.
Finally, we will investigate at the molecular level how condensate constituents interact with the
microenvironment and associated chromatin elements, and test the hypothesis that retention of
transcription factors boosts binding site occupancy and stabilizes condensates at regulatory chromatin.
Targeted perturbation and locus-specific observation will allow us to answer this question and begin to
identify genome-wide rules that predict where precisely chromatin-supported condensates form.
The overall vision for this research program is to develop an integrated view of chromatin organization
and condensate formation. Experimental data will inspire new conceptual frameworks and help us
integrate the full complexity of condensates into paradigms of biological function such as transcription
regulation. We expect that new biophysical models of self-organization and self-regulation will emerge
from our studies of intracellular condensates."

MODIFICATIONS
PROJECT SUMMARY
Chemical modifications are prevalent in the cellular RNA across all domains of life; they expand the chemical
space beyond the four natural building blocks of RNA, modulate folding, intermolecular interactions involving
RNA, and regulate gene expression. Growing evidence shows that several RNA chemical modifications can be
reversed by endogenous enzymes and can respond to external cues, including metabolic signaling, nutrient
starvation, oxidative stress, and temperature change. Interestingly, many proteins known to directly or indirectly
regulate RNA chemical modifications are found to be dysregulated in physiological defects or diseases, forming
the basis of many exciting hypotheses to discover the role of the epitranscriptome in gene expression regulation.
 While our understanding and therapeutic exploitation of epitranscriptome-based gene expression control
continue to expand, the molecular mechanisms that govern this regulation remain poorly understood. A critical
question in the epitranscriptome field is the sequence specificity of various RNA modifications: how they are
installed on specific sequence locations and how they regulate specific protein-RNA recognition. Studying the
sequence contexts of chemically modified endogenous RNA has been technically challenging. With recent
advances in high-throughput sequencing-based technologies, we can now map and quantify only a handful of
RNA chemical modifications (out of over 150 types) in their native sequence contexts inside cells. The pilot
mapping studies revealed conserved sequence elements associated with the occurrence of specific
modifications across different domains of life. That such conserved occurrence of modifications, rather than
being randomly distributed, strongly suggests the involvement of dedicated endogenous machinery that
regulates modifications with high specificity. However, we do not understand why and how the modifications are
installed at specific locations and regulate biology, most likely in a sequence-dependent manner. To address
this knowledge gap, we need methods to detect RNA modifications confidently within sequence contexts that
offer high accuracy and throughput. Here we propose a program focusing on developing such methods and
performing systematic biochemical characterization of the sequence specificity of effector proteins by combining
in vitro high-throughput assay and in cellulo massive parallel reporter assay approaches. Inspired by recent
findings that modification reader proteins may recognize more than one chemical modification, we aim to revisit
the molecular recognition mechanism of the most heavily modified RNA – transfer RNAs in human cells.
 By developing more advanced detection tools in mapping RNA chemical modifications in biological RNA and
designed oligonucleotide libraries modified in vitro or in cellular reporter assays, we will elucidate the
fundamental biochemical properties of the critical regulators of the epitranscriptome with unprecedented
efficiency and comprehensiveness, leading to a better understanding of RNA regulation, and new opportunities
to exploit and control the epitranscriptome."
10933426,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Across 25 million emergency department (ED) visits annually, children experience widely variable care due to
major differences in readiness and capabilities between EDs. These differences bear on the likelihood that a
patient will receive an accurate diagnosis and timely, high-quality treatment. Measuring outcomes across the
entire national pediatric acute care system has proved difficult because granular, national, geocoded
healthcare data have been unavailable; investigators have focused on individual diseases; regional healthcare
maps are outdated; challenges abound with risk adjustment for individuals’ personal risk; and because each
disease requires a different approach to measure its outcomes. Further complicating efforts is the complex
network of relationships between hospitals in which multiple facilities share responsibility for outcomes. These
relationships are substantially different between adult and child patients, and there is no working understanding
of the structure of the national pediatric network. This proposal will overcome those challenges to create the
Atlas of Pediatric Acute Care, a comprehensive examination of the acute care outcomes of 37.7 million
children across the nation, which represents half of the US child population. The Atlas will map regional
hospital systems using sophisticated network analysis algorithms known as community detection. The map
that results will define regions of pediatric care in which there is a shared responsibility for care. It will be used
to determine regional outcomes across three serious conditions in children: appendicitis (the most common
surgical condition in children), neurotrauma (the most common cause of serious injury), and sepsis (a
notoriously difficult-to-diagnose condition that is one of the costliest). This knowledge will then provide the
basis to compare regional systems to elucidate the factors associated with high performance. We will also use
the highest-quality methods to understand costs, using actual patient and payer expenditures, across US
pediatric regions. This proposal reflects the priorities of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child
Health and Human Development: to use “large-scale datasets to optimize outcomes for traumatized, injured,
and critically ill children” and to “examine the epidemiology and treatment of all forms of critical illness.”
Focusing efforts to improve outcomes nationally has the potential to improve the population health, but
depends on an accurate, multi-disease understanding of outcomes. The Atlas will provide such an
understanding and will emerge as an enduring resource to support efforts to improve pediatric acute care,
which will translate to better survival and higher quality of life for the nation’s children."

Advancement of science is enhanced when researchers have diverse backgrounds, talents, and perspectives to
stimulate innovative and creative approaches that address healthcare challenges. The talent, experiences, and
participation of students from underrepresented groups has been demonstrated to be starkly low in science,
technology, and engineering and are worse at the doctoral levels of training and beyond. This project seeks to
establish the Peach State Bridges to the Doctorate Program (PSB2D) at Kennesaw State University, in
partnership with the University of Georgia, to increase the number of underrepresented students entering
doctoral programs in the biomedical sciences. The innate abilities of these students will be refined and polished
after matriculation through our Master of Science in Integrative Biology (MSIB) or Master of Science in Chemistry
and Biochemistry (MSCB) degree programs. In combination with the training and guidance provided by the
PSB2D program, successful students will transition into doctoral programs in the biomedical sciences. Four
ambitious objectives have been set to achieve this goal: (1) recruit five underrepresented students per year for
five years that seek a master’s degree as a bridge into a biomedical doctoral (PhD) program; (2) retain and (3)
train at least 80% of PSB2D students and provide truly exceptional graduate research opportunities; (4) facilitate
the successful transition of at least 80% of PSB2D students into doctoral programs in the biomedical sciences.

selected into the PSB2D program. Successful applicants will display an expressed interest in pursuing a
biomedical PhD or MD/PhD. Directed research and enrichment activities are planned for the two-year
appointment of each Bridges trainee. The first year will feature training in foundational research skills,
responsible conduct, methods to enhance reproducibility, thesis development, and workshops to prepare
trainees for doctoral program applications in the fall. Monthly Bridges meetings will build inclusiveness, respect,
scientific identity, socialization, cohesion, and scientific communication. The second year will focus on doctoral
interview preparation, in addition to further research training. PSB2D scholars will receive peer and faculty
mentoring throughout the two-year appointment. Networking opportunities with biomedical professionals
(academia, industry, private sector) will be featured in seminars. An advisory committee will oversee program
effectiveness. Using the above measurable objectives, survey instruments will be deployed by an external
evaluator to assess mentee training and mentor effectiveness. We will modify our program as needed, based on
assessment outcomes. Results will be disseminated by our program website, conference proceedings, and
journal articles. If we are successful, we will help NIH diversify the voices and talents of the biomedical workforce
by matriculating at least 16 Bridges trainees into biomedical PhD programs over the five years of this project."

 The human RNA-binding proteins, PUM1 and PUM2, are essential for mammalian development and their
dysfunction is linked to multiple human diseases including developmental defects, neurological disorders,
infertility, cancers, and mitochondrial dysfunction. These important functions compel our overall objective to
discover how PUM1&2 control the flow of genetic information from gene to mRNA to protein and to identify the
full repertoire of genes that they regulate. PUM1&2 bind to thousands of mRNAs in human cells by recognizing
an RNA sequence called the Pumilio Response Element (PRE). Previous research showed that PUM1&2
promote degradation of hundreds of these PRE-containing mRNAs by recruiting RNA decay enzymes. It is now
clear, however, that this mechanism represents only one type of PUM-mediated regulatory outcome. Thousands
of mRNAs are bound by PUM1&2 but are not degraded. Therefore, it is now necessary to determine how
PUM1&2 control the fate of all target mRNAs. The resulting data will provide a comprehensive view of their
regulatory roles in biology and pathogenesis.
 We propose that human PUM1&2 repress many target mRNAs by inhibiting the process of translation.
This hypothesis is supported by multiple examples of genes that are repressed by PUM1&2 at the level of protein
abundance in the absence of mRNA degradation. The mechanism and prevalence of this translational inhibition
is unknown. In addition, our data indicate that for some genes PUM-mediated translational inhibition can
synergize with RNA degradation to regulate gene expression to a larger extent than either process alone.
 RNA molecules form structures that influence their function and fate. While biochemical evidence
indicates that RNA structure can modulate PUM-PRE interactions, its effect in vivo remains unknown. In fact,
there is an overall lack of RNA structural information of mRNAs in human cells that limits our understanding of
how that structure influences gene regulation by RNA-binding proteins like PUM1&2.
 The proposed research seeks to determine how PUM1&2 inhibit translation and to identify the
translational regulatory factors that are necessary for PUM1&2 activity. The structure of human mRNAs will be
determined and its effect on PUM-mRNA interactions and regulatory network will be analyzed. By integrating
this new data with existing knowledge of which mRNAs are bound and degraded by PUM1&2, we will develop a
comprehensive understanding of this key genetic regulatory network. Discovery of the full regulatory network of
PUM1&2 will provide new insights into how they control gene expression to regulate normal biological processes.
Moreover, this knowledge will help elucidate how their dysfunction leads to diseases such as neurodegeneration
and cancer."

Since we discovered repeat associated non-ATG (RAN) RAN translation in 2011, we and
others have shown that RAN proteins accumulate in nine different expansion disorders. These
proteins, which can be expressed from both sense and antisense expansion transcripts,
accumulate in disease-relevant human tissues including spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8)
and Huntington disease (HD). We now have evidence that polySer and polyLeu RAN proteins
accumulate in a group of spinocebellar ataxias (SCA1, 2, 3, 6 and 7) in which the CAG·CTG
expansion mutations are located in polyGln open reading frames. Additionally, we have
developed AAV and small molecule approaches to inhibit RAN translation. We will use these
tools and genetic approaches to test our central hypotheses that RAN protein pathology is a
common feature shared across polyglutamine encoding CAG·CTG expansion disorders and
that inhibiting the PKR pathway will reduce RAN protein levels and mitigate disease.
We will address our central hypothesis in three specific aims (1) To test the hypothesis that
RAN proteins contribute to spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) caused by polyglutamine encoding
CAG·CTG repeat expansion mutations. (2) To test the hypothesis that SCA and HD RAN
proteins are toxic and PKR inhibition will decrease RAN protein levels and improve cellular
phenotypes in HD and SCA3 iPSC derived cells (3) : To test the hypothesis that RAN proteins
contribute to HD and SCA3 phenotypes in mice independent of polyGln effects using genetic
and pharmacological approaches. Taken together these specific aims will determine the
contribution of RAN proteins to HD,SCA3 and CAG·CTG repeat expansion disorders and
characterize PKR inhibition as a potential therapeutic approach for this large class of
devastating repeat expansion diseases."
10894650,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cancer is linked to almost every human DNA repair (DR) pathway. Genomic instability, which results
from DR defects, is a cancer hallmark. Thus, DNA damaging cancer therapies are widely used and
are often successful. Yet, the effects of DNA damage depend on poorly understood DR complexes
that are also targets for advanced treatments, e.g. PARP inhibitors that rely on a synthetic lethality
(SL) relationship between PARP and BRCA proteins. Although effective initially, these treatments
often later fail due to various means of resistance developed in tumors. Thus, better strategies are
urgently required to delay or avoid resistance by identifying new SL partners. This revised MANTIS-
DRC R35 application will focus on the BRCA paradox (whereby BRCA-defective tumor cells survive
yet BRCA inactivation causes cell and embryonic lethality) with implications for future efforts to
modulate the DNA damage response to harness the abscopal effect (a paradox whereby ionizing
radiation is immunosuppressive yet can activate an immune response to kill tumors distant from the
radiation site). We hypothesize that answers to both the 'BRCA paradox' and the ‘abscopal paradox’
lie in changes to DNA damage response that will aid in identifying strategies to tackle resistance.
Based upon his NCI-funded experience, Prof. Tainer is poised to build program efforts to efficiently
define and test these DR changes that will inform: 1) BRCA essentiality in most cells and SL in
tumors and 2) strategies to control the abscopal effect. This work will thus leverage and apply
Tainer’s seminal contributions in integrating crystal structures with X-ray scattering to define
conformations and assemblies in solution that link structures to phenotypes. Specifically, we will focus
on defining a largely enigmatic BRCA1 interactome by producing atomic-resolution structural
information and identifying new BRCA1 SL partners: these will be key proteins and interfaces
regulating DR pathways (and potentially capable of inducing an abscopal response) that are difficult
to overcome via resistance pathways. To elucidate how DR complexes orchestrate cellular processes
on DNA, we will integrate structure and imaging to map their spatial distribution and measure their
temporal dynamics with systematic and comprehensive analyses. Rather than correlating large data
sets, we will rigorously merge suitable data sets via tested Bayesian approaches for integrating data
with maximum likelihood weighting according to the relative confidence in each measurement.
Leveraging cutting-edge clinical information at MD Anderson will enable testing relevance and impact
of our predictions by comparisons with results in patient databases. Anticipated collective results will
produce quantitative, objective and mechanistic data to combine measurements from molecules to
cells, to design dissection-of-function mutations and inhibitor tools, and to predict biological outcomes."
10847501,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Somatic mosaicism is a biological phenomenon that describes the presence of genetically distinct cells within a
subject. Mosaic mutations dictate numerous human phenotypes and are causal factors for a range of human
diseases such as autisim, cardiac disorders and cancers. Analysis of somatic mutations in normal tissues is
important for the understanding of both normal phenotype manifestations and the early onset of human
diseases. However, our current knowledge of the mosaic mutations is only the tip of the iceberg due to the
technical and computational challenges in detecting mosaic mutations with bulk genomic methods. In the past
3-5 years, high throughout single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have emerged as powerful
tools to dissect the cellular ecosystems of human tissues by profiling thousands of single cell transcriptomes.
The human cell atlas (HCA) projects have generated huge number of scRNA-seq datasets for many human
organs from eye to brain. Whereas these projects are focused on delineating cell types and cell states within
each tissue, they provide tremendous data resources to investigate the full spectrum of rare mosaic mutations
in human organs. The lack of robust computational tools presents as one major gap in knowledge to construct
a global mosaic mutation atlas of human organs from these data. Previous studies used bulk mutation calling
methods to perform single cell genotyping from scRNA-seq data, which however had low sensitivity that is
equivalent to bulk approaches. The central hypothesis is that rare mosaic mutations and their diversified
effects on cellular functions can be uncovered by genotyping single cells from scRNA-seq data. This project
has three major research goals: 1) Develop robust computational methods to accurately detect rare mosaic
mutations from scRNA-seq data. This includes a Bayesian method MosaiCopy for detection of copy number
variations, a toolkit MosaiTect for discovery of allele-specific point mutations, and a model-based method
MosaiMtTect to detect mutations in mtDNAs in individual cells. 2) Estimate the functional effects of mosaic
mutations in rare cells by developing a machine-learning software scGPS (single cell Genotype-Phenotype
Synergy). Additionally, this method will quantify the threshold of phenotype manifestation for each mosaic
mutation. 3) Genotype HCA datasets to investigate the cell type and cell state specific mutations and their
functions in affected cells of human organs. As a case study and validation of the results, the in-house heart
cell atlas datasets will be generated from healthy hearts (collected during heart transplantation). The overall
goal of this project is to develop novel computational methods to investigate the global pictures of mosaic
mutations and functional effects on cells of human organs. Successful completion of this project will lead to
new insights into the effects of genomic diversification on cell functions within human body. In long term, this
study will have significant impact on the development of novel prevention strategies for human diseases by
inhibiting the manifestations of clinical phenotypes at the very early stage of normal development."
10924054,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The concept of cancer precision medicine is simple: patient treatments are guided by the molecular features of
their tumor. In practice, however, the situation is more complex. Only a minority of patients at present benefit
from the approach. A number of scientific challenges must be overcome before cancer precision medicine can
become a reality for all patients. These challenges are the focus on the present research proposal. For
example, we now know that gene expression, not DNA-level aberrations, are the most predictive of drug
response, and yet the entire clinical genomic testing enterprise is focused on DNA. We therefore need to
develop methods suitable for quantitative RNA-based diagnostics, likely using emerging single cell and in situ
sequencing methods. In addition, we must develop comprehensive maps using preclinical models that make it
possible to predict drug sensitivity (and genetic vulnerabilities) given the molecular features of the tumor. This
will require expanding our repertoire of cell models (to include organoids, short-term primary tumor cultures
and models that combine tumor cells and immune cells), developing more sophisticated read-outs of drug
action beyond viability, and also developing new insights into the influence of the tumor microenvironment on
mediating cell survival and drug resistance. The present proposal aims to address these challenges over the 7
years ahead by developing new methods and datasets that will accelerate cancer precision medicine research
throughout the research community."
10701994,"Many Veterans with lower limb amputation who use prostheses suffer from skin related
prosthetic fit issues such as scars. Problematic scars may be managed with surgical excision
that can yield a larger, more sensitive scar. Massage and desensitization techniques are also
options. These current interventions yield widely varied results based on many factors including
clinician skill, which modality is selected, patient compliance and others. Prosthetic use,
walking, training, scar steroid injection and other therapies are options for scar management
today. Current scar management treatments are limited due to high variance in effectiveness.
Fractionated CO2 laser treatment however is a proven intervention for scar treatment in non-
amputee patients, such as those with limb salvage or burns. The overall goal of this preliminary
study is to determine if fractionated CO2 laser therapy, may potentially improve outcomes in
Veterans who use prostheses who have limitations due to problematic scars.
 In this preliminary investigation, we will study the potential of fractionated CO2 laser therapy
to decrease scar related discomfort, improve mobility and comfort otherwise restricted from
problematic stump scarring and thus to improve quality of life. We anticipate this will be a high-
impact rapid translation intervention with the potential to restore functionality to individuals with
lower limb amputation and transform the role of dermatologic care in lower limb prosthetics. The
objective of this preliminary study is to explore the ability to recruit a sample of lower limb
prosthesis users, coordinate laser therapy, collect outcomes and assure coordination and data
fidelity between sites and facilitate determination of parameters for a future, more definitive
clinical study of fractionated CO2 laser in the lower limb amputee population burdened with
problematic scarring. Our clinical hypothesis is fractionated CO2 laser treatment will provide
considerable improvements in comfort, pain reduction, mobility and quality of life in lower limb
prosthesis users. Further, we hypothesize we will be able to recruit a sample, assure data
fidelity and be able to use the outcomes to estimate the power and sample to support a future
clinical investigation and VA Merit application.
 Six to eight subjects will be recruited from the Tampa VA. They will receive a pre-procedural
assessment including subjective and objective measures ultimately to measure functional
mobility, socket comfort, prosthetic history, health related quality of life and residual limb
measures (i.e. volumetrics, range of motion, muscle testing and others). Subjects will then be
evaluated (including dermatologic outcome measures) by and receive laser therapy from a
credentialed dermatologist and then return to the Tampa VA to repeat the aforementioned
outcomes at 6 week, 3 months and 6 months follow ups. Following laser therapy, outcomes
data will be analyzed to determine the treatment effect, power and ultimately, the necessary
sample size for a future VA Merit proposal. Additionally, the study will provide preliminary
evidence of efficacy of laser therapy in this population. It will also permit selection of the most
ideal outcome measures and facilitate optimization of a protocol for the configuration of an
optimized, more definitive study to determine efficacy of laser therapy in Veterans with lower
limb amputation who use prostheses."
10919879,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant plasma cell neoplasm leading to anemia, hypercalcemia, renal
insufficiency and bone lesions. It is preceded by a common benign monoclonal plasma cell expansion called
monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) that shares the same initiating events seen in
MM. These include recurrent immunoglobulin gene translocations, and hyperdiploidy. There is a third clinical
entity in between these two, smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM), in which there has been more extensive
plasma cell expansion than MGUS, but the malignant features of MM are not seen. This project is focused on
using genetics to more precisely demarcate benign from malignant plasma cells and develop a patho-genetic
definition of MM. We hypothesize that an accumulation of secondary genetic events mark the progression from
a benign to malignant state. These events involve a handful of pathways common to many cancers:
MYC/MAX, MAPK (NRAS, KRAS, BRAF, FGFR3, PTPN11, NF1), NFKB (TRAF3, TRAF2, CYLD, BIRC2/3,
MAPK3K14), TP53/MDM2, RB1/CDKN2C, Others (DIS3, FAM46C). One of these pathways is dysregulated in
>95% of MM and <5% of MGUS, and we postulate that individually or in combination they can be used to
define malignant plasma cells. There is also increasing evidence of a role of the tumor microenvironment in
progression of SMM, and recently clonal hematopoiesis has been associated with increased inflammation, and
more rapid progression of MM. We will use next generation sequencing to identify clonal hematopoiesis, and to
characterize the genetic events present in patients with MGUS, SMM and MM, and correlate these with the
clinical course. We will validate our findings in an independent cohort of patients with SMM enrolled on
prospective randomized clinical trials. Ultimately, we hope that a genetic definition will allow both the early
detection and prompt treatment of MM, resulting in the prevention of the malignant consequences of MM, and
prolonged survival for patients."
10919881,"ABSTRACT: Developmental Research Program (DRP). The goal of the Developmental Research Program
in the Mayo Clinic SPORE in Multiple Myeloma is to support innovative, scientifically sound projects that
investigate any area pertaining to translational myeloma research. Funding from this program will stimulate
developmental research that incorporates techniques and theoretical approaches that may not have been
previously utilized in myeloma research. In so doing it provides a mechanism by which the SPORE can
increase the number of scientists and clinical investigators who are committed to translational myeloma
research. The Developmental Research Program will encourage the development of suitable projects,
coordinate project review and selection, make funding recommendations to the Executive Committee, and
monitor research progress. We have requested $140,000 annually ($90,000 per year from the SPORE funds
augmented by $50,000 per year in matching funds from the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center) for the Developmental
Research Program. We aim to provide research support to three to four projects per year for one year with a
second year of support possible based on exceptional progress towards the stated aims of the project. The
long term goal is to translate the findings generated by developmental projects into a reduction in the incidence
and mortality rates of myeloma. Without the funding, infrastructure, and expertise of the SPORE projects and
investigators, it will be unlikely that innovative developmental research projects of the kind we envision can be
brought to fruition. Specifically, the primary goals of the Developmental Research Program are to: (1)
encourage innovative translational studies that are promising and have the potential to improve outcome in
myeloma and mature into independently funded projects; (2) foster extensive collaboration between basic
science and clinical disciplines in translational research in myeloma in the context of the myeloma SPORE
program; (3) encourage investigators to apply their research findings in other tumor types to translational
research in myeloma and; (4) generate new hypotheses that can be tested and provide the foundation for
future largescale research projects or clinical trials in order to reduce myeloma incidence and mortality rates."

The Career Enhancement Program is designed to increase the translational investigator base in the Mayo
Myeloma SPORE by identifying and fostering the early careers of young investigators who have an interest in
multiple myeloma translational research. In particular, this program provides much-needed support for
promising young laboratory or clinical investigators early in their careers so that they can focus their energies
on research projects related to multiple myeloma research. The SPORE CEP provides $50,000 for one year
($90,000 from SPORE funds and institutional support of $50,000 from the Mayo Clinic cancer Center) for 2-3
awards per year. A second year of support is possible based on progress and successful re-competition.
Mayo, as part of its commitment through the Mayo Comprehensive Cancer Center, has agreed to match these
funds. The Career Enhancement Program makes maximal use of the scientific expertise within the Mayo
community. The Career Enhancement Program Committee is responsible for organizing the program and
reviewing research proposals as submitted. During the prior funding period (years 1-5), the SPORE has
supported 12 investigators each for 1 year. All of them remain involved in translational research in myeloma
and related hematologic malignancies, and 10 of 12 are still involved in our SPORE and one is at another NCI
designated Cancer Center.
During the next funding period, the SPORE will maintain:
 · a stringent candidate selection system that encourages applications from minorities and women
 · comprehensive trainee guidance by a mentor
 · support through a scientific mentor group (the Individual Trainee Mentorship Committee) comprised of
 investigators with expertise in each trainee’s area of interest
 · multi-disciplinary research courses and on-going training activities such as the Multidisciplinary Cancer
 Seminar Series and Myeloma Group meetings
 · encouragement of collaboration with investigators at all Mayo sites
 · opportunities for further research enhancement through the Developmental Research Program and full

 Cocaine use disorder continues to be a significant health burden, with psychostimulant overdose
deaths rising significantly over the past few years. Cocaine exposure can alter aspects of mitochondrial
function, but the tools to access and manipulate mitochondria in vivo are limited. Mitochondria contribute a
significant amount of the energy required for events in the synapse in the form of adenosine triphosphate
(ATP). Production of ATP in mitochondria near synapses is tightly regulated by the influx of calcium into
mitochondria and leads to the generation of reactive oxygen species within the mitochondrial matrix. The
studies in this proposal aim to measure and manipulate mitochondrial function, specifically calcium and
hydrogen peroxide signaling in vivo, to determine how mitochondrial activity in dopamine neurons is altered in
response to cocaine exposure. We will target three mitochondria-specific protein-encoding genes using a novel
CRISPR viral strategy to knock out genes from dopamine neurons in DATCre mice in vivo. The target genes are
involved in regulating calcium and hydrogen peroxide concentrations in mitochondria: Micu1, which is part of
the mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex and allows mitochondrial calcium influx; Crls1, which encodes an
enzyme necessary for the synthesis of cardiolipin, a mitochondrial phospholipid involved in integrating calcium
and reactive oxygen species signaling; and Sod2, a mitochondria-specific superoxide dismutase that converts
superoxide into hydrogen peroxide and enables removal of ROS from the mitochondrial matrix. Notably, Micu1
and Crls1 encode mitochondrial proteins that have been identified as targets of lead compounds, allowing for a
relatively rapid determination of whether these systems can be modulated in vivo for substance use disorder
treatments. To begin developing drugs for Sod2 and to refine drugs targeting Micu1 and Crls1, these studies
will use mitochondrially-targeted fluorescent sensors for calcium and hydrogen peroxide in combination with
fiber photometry in vivo. My preliminary evidence shows that HyPerRed, a hydrogen peroxide sensor, can be
used in vivo in cortical neurons to record responses to drugs of abuse. The studies in this proposal will expand
on these characterizations and further determine how cocaine may alter reactive oxygen species activity in
presynaptic terminals of dopamine neurons in the nucleus accumbens core. I will also test mitochondrially-
targeted GCaMP to develop a comprehensive understanding of how calcium and reactive oxygen species
activity is coordinated within mitochondria. These sensors will be combined with the CRISPR viral knockout
strategies and pharmacological tools targeting mitochondria to further characterize the specificity of these
signals and the possible impact of these pharmacological approaches on neural function and behavior.
Together, these studies will enable the exploration of a novel avenue of research by monitoring and
manipulating mitochondrial function in vivo to develop treatments for cocaine use disorders."
10830474,"Project Summary/Abstract
Cocaine use disorder is a chronic disease and currently no approved pharmacotherapies exist for its treatment.
Among the greatest challenges in the treatment of cocaine use disorder is prevention of relapse to drug use. In
rats, periods of abstinence following cocaine use intensifies seeking and motivation for drug, which has been
associated with increased propensity for relapse. Although extensive evidence indicates that mesolimbic
dopamine influences cocaine reinforcement, the involvement of dopamine in the regulation of sleep has received
comparatively less attention. We recently demonstrated that the dopamine transporter governs diurnal
fluctuations in extracellular dopamine tone in the nucleus accumbens and that dopamine uptake fluctuates
across the sleep/wake cycle, which impacts the effects of cocaine at inhibiting the dopamine transporter.
Moreover, our preliminary and recently published data suggest that sleep disturbances that occur during
abstinence promote cocaine seeking and that alterations in dopamine transporter function in the nucleus
accumbens may contribute to these effects. Together, these findings raise the possibility that dopamine
neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens may function as a node that integrates both motivational and
sleep/wake processes. In the proposed studies, we hypothesize that cocaine-related sleep disruptions during
abstinence contribute to dopamine transporter adaptations that promote incubation of cocaine seeking and
increase dopamine transporter sensitivity to cocaine. Further, we propose that restoration of rapid-eye movement
sleep and/or normalization of dopamine transporter function during abstinence will attenuate incubation of
cocaine seeking and reduce dopamine transporter sensitivity to cocaine. Completion of the proposed
experiments will offer new insights into the link between sleep disruptions and development of cocaine seeking,
and the extent to which this involves alterations in dopamine neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens.
Consequently, expected results should significantly inform the field and help to identify future treatment
strategies for cocaine use disorder."

The primary goal of this proposal is to fill critical gaps related to timing, route and dose of tranexamic acid (TXA)
in prevention of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) to maximize maternal benefit while minimizing fetal-neonatal and
maternal risks. With my clinical background in Maternal-Fetal Medicine, research experiences in epidemiologic
and translational coagulation methods, and prior preliminary data, I have the expertise and strong scientific
premise to successfully complete these aims. The proposed innovative study focuses on three unique
subpopulations (vaginal delivery, cesarean delivery, morbid obesity) and has three routes of TXA administration
(intravenous over 2 minutes, intravenous over 10 minutes and intramuscular) immediately prior to childbirth.
Neonatal exposure will be assessed through TXA concentrations in umbilical cord blood and breast milk, as well
as clinical outcomes at delivery, 2 weeks and 6 weeks postpartum. The specific aims are as follows: 1a)
Determine the optimal timing, route and dose of prophylactic TXA for prevention of PPH 1b) Determine neonatal
exposure to TXA through transplacental transfer and breast milk when TXA is administered pre-cord clamp, and
2) Characterize prothrombotic and fibrinolytic biomarkers in maternal circulation following TXA. The innovative
nature of this grant is multifold: a) repurposing an inexpensive generic drug to address disparities in obstetric
hemorrhage; b) exploring rapid administration via IM and 2min infusion to improve access in low resource
settings; c) pre-cord clamp TXA administration as a novel approach not yet considered in large obstetric clinical
trials; d) refinement of dosing in unique subpopulations (morbidly obese, vaginal delivery); e) biomarker safety
including a no drug group and f) a robust team of multidisciplinary experts with regional and international
expertise. Specifically, team members have expertise in clinical pharmacology, neonatal medicine, lab medicine,
thrombosis and hemostasis, clinical trials in pregnant women and newborns, pharmacometrics and
epidemiology/biostatistics. I have an ideal working environment, rooted in the Clinical and Translational Science
Institute partnering GW and Children’s National Hospital but also extended through supplemental sites at
University of Maryland Center for Translational Medicine and University of North Carolina Coagulation Lab. In
summary, this proposal sets forth aims that are significant, innovative, feasible, and will help the obstetric
community better understand how peripartum hemostasis can be optimized using TXA while being sure to
minimize fetal/neonatal risks. Ultimately, our work will answer important questions that are part of the solution
for how to prevent maternal morbidity and mortality for the 140 million women worldwide that give birth each
year."
10847508,"The estrogen receptor- (ER) represents one of the most successful molecular entities as both a biomarker and target for
cancer therapy, but some 30-50% of patients show de novo or acquired resistance. ER is a ligand regulated transcription
factor that acts as a scaffold for histone modifying enzymes to modulate gene expression and growth of ER+ breast cancers
(BCs). Importantly, the different treatment modalities of SERMs, SERDs and aromatase inhibitors induce different
conformational effects on ER that often allow resistance to one type of treatment to be effectively treated by another. There
is currently a significant unmet clinical need for new therapies that are effective in de novo and acquired resistance models,
such as overexpression of receptor tyrosine kinases or activation of their downstream signaling pathways. We recently
showed that an EGFR overexpression model rendered breast cancer cells broadly resistant to SERMs, as seen in patients.
We also developed a new chemical targeting strategy for ER, which we call dual mechanism ER inhibitors (DMERI).
Importantly, we identified both SERM and SERD DMERI as efficacious in the EGFR overexpression model, and many of
them showed efficacy greater than fulvestrant, and in fulvestrant resistance models. The SERM DMERI may be an effective
treatment for patients with EGFR overexpression at initial presentation, comprising a significant subset of ER+ BCs
associated with clinical resistance. The marked difference in efficacy between SERMs and SERM DMERI in this resistant
model provide us with robust chemical biology tools to dissect mechanisms of action. Our first goal is to understand the
mechanisms of ER/EGFR signaling crosstalk and its regulation by different classes of ER ligands. A second goal is to
understand the molecular mechanisms of ligand efficacy more generally through identifying ligand-specific coregulator-
gene networks that regulate ER-dependent growth inhibition. The delineation of the ligand-receptor-coregulator gene code
will enable understanding ligand mechanism of action and basic principles of transcription regulation in control of cell
growth."
10835101,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Osteoclasts (OCs), the bone resorbing cells, arise from myeloid OC progenitors (OCPs) and are critical
for bone remodeling and homeostasis. OC differentiation and activity are tightly regulated by intrinsic negative
feedback loops (autoregulatory) and by paracrine factors secreted by other cells, most notably osteoprotegerin.
Intrinsic regulators are critically important for calibrating physiologic OCgenesis, disruption of which leads to
uncontrolled pathologic OCgenesis and osteolysis. Using proteomic studies in an independent study, we have
recently identified a novel autoregulatory role of IFN stimulated gene-15 (ISG15), a ubiquitin-like small molecule,
in OCgenesis. Specifically, we found that RANKL induces expression of ISG15 in OCPs and OCs, which binds
to NEMO (a.k.a. IKKg) to down regulates NF-kB signaling. We found that stimulation of OCPs with RANKL
induces IFNa/b secretion by OCPs, which engages and activates type 1 IFN receptor (IFNAR) signaling in OCPs
themselves to trigger ISG15-dependent local autoregulatory negative feedback loop to limit the extent of
OCgenesis. This mechanism appears to depend on STimulator of INterferon Genes (STING), which we find to
be expressed in response to RANKL and is essential for IFNa/b, and ISG15 expression, and was validated by
data showing that blocking either STING or IFNa/b diminishes RANKL-induced ISG15 levels and exacerbates
OCgenesis. Collectively, these observations suggest that endogenous ISG15 inhibits OCgenesis through its
classical binding to target proteins, which is facilitated by the sequential action of highly specific E1 (Ube1L), E2
(UbcH8), E3 (Herc6) ligases, a post-translational modification termed ISGylation that maintains cellular
homeostasis. However, ISGylation is a reversible mechanism, whereby under inflammatory conditions, free
ISG15 is generated in abundance by cells, secreted to the extracellular (EC) space by secretory vesicles, and
acts as a cytokine by binding LFA1 receptor. In this regard, we show that inflammatory stimulation of OCPs with
the bacterial product LPS inhibits expression of Ube1L, the E1 enzyme, and induces secretion of ample ECISG15.
More surprisingly, we found that ISG15KO mice responded poorly to LPS and developed negligible osteolysis
compared to robust bone loss by LPS-induced WT counterparts. This event was TNF-dependent, evident by low
levels of TNFa in ISG15KO serum compared to copious amounts of TNF in serum of WT mice. Hence, ECISG15
appears to exacerbate OCgenesis and depends on intact endogenous ISG15.
Based on these observations, our overarching hypothesis states that ISG15 has bi-modal functions: under
physiologic conditions, ISG15 is conjugated to OC signaling proteins to limit OCgenesis and maintain
homeostasis, whereas inflammatory conditions facilitate secretion of free ECISG15, which then acts as an
inflammatory cytokine to exacerbate OCgenesis and osteolysis. To test this hypothesis, we will: (1) Elucidate
the mechanism by which intracellular ISG15 inhibits OCs, and (2) Determine the mechanism(s) by which
ECISG15 exacerbates basal OCgenesis and inflammatory osteolysis"

Recognition of antigen is the first critical step required in triggering T cell survival, expansion, development of
effector functions, and transition to memory. In a joint project between the Evavold and Williams labs, we will
determine how T cell receptor (TCR) and peptide:MHC (pMHC) affinity, bond lifetimes, and force magnitude
define T cell phenotype. The proposed work is therefore impactful as it begins to delineate the role each of
these parameters play in the rich T cell biology associated with TCR signal strength. To date, the concept of
TCR strength of signal has generally been described with three-dimensional SPR affinity in mind and
measured via representative surface markers, pMHC tetramers, and functional readouts. In contrast to these
methods, our studies depend on the analysis of TCR and pMHC interactions at the surface of the cell
membrane using novel assays that define the in-situ two-dimensional contact that occurs between T cells and
APCs during antigen recognition. The preliminary work has discovered that bond lifetime and level of force as
opposed to affinity provides the major driving force for phenotypic fate. The three specific aims will redefine the
concept of TCR strength of signal, dissect affinity from bond lifetime, and determine outcomes of low affinity
TCRs during infection. Currently, the TCR affinity and bond lifetime for pMHC are unknown for many T cell
responses, limiting our knowledge on how T cell mediated responses are triggered and how affinity and bond
lifetime are translated into TCR strength of signal and effector phenotypes. Therefore, our work will prove
insightful by addressing the discrepancy between affinity based predictions and actual T cell functional
outcomes."

resourced settings. Motherhood is both a protective and risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. In the
perinatal period, women have increased risk for suicidal ideation and experience higher rates of violence and
violent death. Given rising suicide rates, the importance of the perinatal period for both mother and child, and
growing dissemination of task-shifting programs to treat common mental disorders, there is critical and urgent
need to incorporate implementation strategies for suicide detection and referral within these programs. While
task-shifted mental health interventions have trained peer community members to successfully deliver low
intensity interventions where access to clinical care is limited, peers remain an untapped resource to provide
suicide prevention support in settings where it is needed most. The goal of this award is to broaden the
candidate’s expertise to conduct independent clinical trials related to suicide prevention research focused on
the integration of community-delivered detection and response in low-resourced, high need, settings. Through
structured mentorship from an expert team, coursework, workshop, and conference attendance, the candidate
will develop new competencies in suicide prevention research, including: (1) quantitative training in longitudinal
analysis for rare events (2) implementation science methods and research design to apply to suicide
prevention interventions; and (3) clinical trial management skills, including ethical conduct of suicide prevention
research in resource strained contexts, to become a NIH-funded independent investigator. Drs. Donna
Spiegelman, Joanna Maselko, Atif Rahman, Paul Pfeiffer, and Byron Powell (alongside a Pakistani advisory
committee) will mentor and advise the candidate to meet these objectives. The proposed research will
(1) examine the epidemiology and health impacts of recurrent suicidal ideation on mothers over time, (2)
characterize key features of suicidal ideation and finalize intervention package components for the study
context, and (3) conduct a pilot clinical trial to assess the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a Suicide
Prevention Package (SuPP) within an existing task-shifted depression intervention. This K01 lays the
groundwork for a future R01 to scale a package for multi-level suicide prevention strategies that can be
integrated into community based mental health programs, particularly targeting individuals living in low-
resourced settings. As the model is designed to be easily adapted and integrated, we anticipate the findings
will be valuable for all researchers looking to improve population health and mental health services in
disadvantaged settings."

Biomedical research is evolving rapidly as new high-throughput technologies, producing massive quantities of
data, open new frontiers in data-driven predictive capabilities, boosting the applicability of complex data
analysis and machine learning algorithms in areas ranging from personalized medicine and drug discovery to
structural biology and microbial ecology. Simultaneously, high standards for ethical production, use, and open
access to data have become essential. This new application seeks support for the Predoctoral Training
Program in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at Boston University which will train young scientists to
become leaders in this transformational era. Ten predoctoral training slots per year are requested to fund five
trainees each in years one and two. The curriculum includes a strong foundation in biological domain
knowledge, advanced methodologies in the quantitative sciences (computing, mathematics, and statistics), an
emphasis on reproducibility habits, awareness of algorithmic and racial bias in research, and extensive
opportunities for developing scientific communications skills. Program features include: 1) three lab rotations,
including the Wet-Lab Experience, which introduces new trainees to high-throughput experimental methods, 2)
the Challenge Project, for first-year team research on open-ended, data-intensive biological problems, with an
emphasis on rigor and reproducibility, 3) Programming workshops for computational skills development, 4)
Algorithmic Bias workshops for recognizing biases in data collection and use, 5) a research-in-progress
Student Seminar, 6) the annual International Workshop in Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, undertaken
jointly with partner programs in Japan and Germany, 7) the annual Student-Organized Symposium, 8) a
teaching requirement, and 9) the annual Program Retreat. Thirty-six faculty mentors from 14 departments,
each with a strong quantitative component to their research, offer a wide range of interdisciplinary expertise in
experimental, mathematical and computational approaches. All use rigorous and reproducible methods in their
research, take an active role in Program activities, are committed to active mentoring, and will have taken
mentor training by the start of Program funding. Three co-PDs, who have worked together for over a decade,
will provide leadership. Each brings training strengths and administrative experience. An Executive
Committee, including five additional faculty will oversee the Program, with direct input from the trainees
through a Student Advisory Council. The Program offers extensive career development activities,
multipronged avenues for student engagement, and a multidimensional scheme for ongoing evaluation."
10848468,"Under the HIV Organ Policy Equity (HOPE) Act, early studies show that kidney transplantation (KT) from
donors with HIV to recipients with HIV (HIV D+/R+) expands the donor pool, reduces wait-times, and yields
excellent short-term patient and graft survival. However, significant rates of rejection were observed with a
trend towards higher rates in D+ recipients compared to HIV-uninfected donor (D-) recipients. Understanding
the impact of D+ on rejection, underlying mechanisms, and the impact on long-term outcomes is critical.
There are potential virologic and immunologic explanations for higher rejection in HIV D+/R+ vs D-/R+ KT. D+
kidneys harbor HIV and are more likely to harbor other co-infections such as CMV. These pathogens may
trigger an inflammatory response, enhancing T-cell or antibody(Ab)-mediated pathways of rejection.
Understanding the type of rejection and risk factors will inform interventions to improve outcomes, e.g. HIV D+
selection criteria, immunosuppression, or targeted monitoring and prophylaxis for co-infections.
We propose Expanding HOPE, a multicenter trial comparing outcomes in 100 HIV D+/R+ KT and 100 D-/R+
KT at 15 transplant centers. We will combine this cohort with prior cohorts of HIV D+ and D- KT from our
HOPE in Action Consortium, established in 2015. HOPE in Action has accrued approximately 325 HIV+ KT
recipients to date; this larger cohort provides sufficient statistical power to determine the impact of HIV D+
organ on rejection and it will also allow us to determine long-term patient and graft outcomes beyond 5 years.
Within this trial, we will perform comprehensive mechanistic studies to examine both T-cell and Ab-mediated
rejection pathways. We will quantify changes in donor-specific and viral-specific (HIV CMV) T cells using an
activated induced marker (AIM) assay in D+ and D- recipients, with and without rejection, over time. We will
perform TCRβ immunosequencing on sorted AIM+ cells vs unsorted T cells to track T cell receptor dynamics.
With VDJ-specific PCR, we will quantify expanded clones, including donor or viral AIM+ cells, post-KT.
We will also characterize inflammation and the humoral response to infections and human proteins (donor,
self). We will use a multiplexed electrochemiluminescence detection assay to quantify >30 cytokine and
chemokines to characterize inflammation, and phage display and immunoprecipitation sequencing to
characterize Abs to >1300 viruses, >14,000 microbial toxins/virulence factors, and >27,000 human autoAbs.
Our HOPE in Action Multicenter Consortium has an established track record, successfully completing
multicenter transplantation trials, including HIV D+/R+ KT. We will leverage our existing infrastructure to
oversee operations, data management, analysis, and safety monitoring.
In summary, the proposed research will determine the impact of HIV+ donor kidneys on rejection, will quantify
long term outcomes, and elucidate risks and mechanisms of rejection. This knowledge can improve and
expand HIV D+/R+ KT, and can provide important insights about alloimmunity more broadly."

A multicenter, randomized controlled trial of single and three-dose
 regimens of oxfendazole for mild (one or two lesions)
 parenchymal brain cysticercosis
SUMMARY
 Taenia solium neurocysticercosis (NCC), the infection of the human central nervous system by the cystic
larvae of Taenia solium, continues to be a major contributor to neurologic morbidity (particularly seizures
and epilepsy) in most of the developing world, and a common diagnosis in immigrant populations in the
USA and other industrialized countries. Anti-parasitic treatment destroys the brain cysts and improves the
prognosis of the seizure disorder. The combination of albendazole (ABZ) plus praziquantel (PZQ) is more
efficacious than ABZ alone in cases with multiple viable brain cysts, and recent publications also suggest
increased efficacy in individuals with mild infections (one to two lesions, by far the most form of
presentation in the Indian subcontinent, as well as in pediatric populations worldwide, in travelers to
endemic regions, and in non-endemic regions such as the US). Still the efficacy of the best available
regimens offer less than 70% efficacy in parenchymal brain NCC with one to two lesions. The recent
development of oxfendazole (OXF) as a potential anti-parasitic agent for human use may provide a new,
practical tool with increased efficacy and easier administration. We will perform a three-arm double blind,
randomized controlled trial in six centers in two different geographic regions, three in India and three in
Peru, to evaluate whether a single dose regime of OXF results in comparable efficacy to the currently used
10 day regime of ABZ plus PZQ, and also whether a 3-dose course of OXF can offer increased parasiticidal
efficacy. The study cohort will also allow identification of early imaging markers that may predict lesion
resolution in response to anti-parasitic treatment, and will provide additional data on the safety of oral OXF
and factors associated to residual scarring, seizure relapses, or reduced quality of life in this population.
Finally, systematic sampling in the cohort will provide defined batteries of DNA, white blood cells, serum
and urine samples for future evaluation of diagnostic assays for single-lesion parenchymal NCC."
10916212,"Project Summary/ Abstract
Gastric dysmotility affects 40-80% of critically ill children and is associated with significant morbidity and mor-
tality. There are knowledge gaps regarding the mechanisms for gastric dysmotility in critically ill children, which
limit the therapeutic options for this cohort. Gastrointestinal (GI) macrophages regulate gastric motility and
have been shown to have microbiome-dependent changes on their function. Microbiome-dependent changes
on macrophage activation are mediated by trans-epithelial intestinal trafficking of microbial products. Zonulin is
a protein that increases trans-epithelial trafficking of microbial products. Models of zonulin expression, includ-
ing a Zonulin transgenic mouse (Ztm), have dysbiosis and activation of pro-inflammatory macrophages. In criti-
cally ill children who express zonulin and in Ztm mice we have identified gastric dysmotility. Our central hy-
pothesis is that zonulin upregulation under conditions of inflammation, increases trans-epithelial trafficking of
microbial products from an altered microbiome which activate macrophages associated with gastric dysmotility.
In Aim 1 we evaluate whether zonulin-mediated increases in trans-epithelial intestinal trafficking due to system-
ic inflammation result in dysbiosis and activation of macrophages associated with gastric dysmotility. We will
complete Aim 1 with Ztm mice and the use of a zonulin inhibitor. In Aim 2a, we will identify differences in mi-
crobiome composition and markers of trans-epithelial intestinal trafficking in relation to gastric motility in pa-
tients with and without the zonulin-producing allele. Direct examination of GI macrophage differences in pa-
tients is not feasible. Therefore, in Aim 2b, we employ a translational mouse model of fecal material transplant
from patients in Aim 2a to examine whether differences in microbiota from patients with and without the zonu-
lin-producing allele and gastric dysmotility result in macrophage activation and gastric dysmotility in the mice.
This proposal fills a knowledge gap in our understanding of mechanisms for gastric dysmotility in critical illness.
Our long-term goal is to identify novel diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for gastric dysmotility in criti-
cal illness, which can impact clinical outcomes for this cohort. This proposal details a four-year project in which
Dr. Martinez will gain experience in clinical-translational research and expertise in GI physiology, mucosal im-
munology, host-microbiome interactions and the neuro-enteric system. These educational opportunities, the
surrounding ideal research environment and established mentoring team that is working with Dr. Martinez will
prepare her to apply for a NIH R01 grant and promote her advancement towards an independent academic
career."
10703841,"Heart transplantation is a key life-saving therapy for patients with end-stage heart failure. However, donor
hearts are in severely short supply, resulting in death of many transplantation candidates before a suitable donor
heart becomes available. Despite this, approximately 70% of cardiac allografts were rejected for transplantation
during 2019-2021; the majority do not meet acceptance criteria, including the limited acceptable time that the
heart experiences warm ischemia, which is longer with donation after circulatory death (DCD) compared to
donation after brain death, the traditional method. This time correlates with progression of myocardial
ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Ameliorating I/R injury, that occurs both during heart procurement and
transport, would improve preservation of graft function, expand the donor pool and increase access to heart
transplantation. Human adipose-derived stromal cells (hASC) are abundant, simple to isolate and expand rapidly
in vitro, and produce paracrine factors that improve many pathologies, including ischemia/reperfusion injury. In
the context of myocardial infarction, they improve myocardial function, inhibit apoptosis, and stimulate
angiogenesis. Pre-treatment of explanted hearts with hASC improves myocardial functional recovery following
acute I/R injury in an ex-vivo heart perfusion system. Similarly, pre-ischemic infusion of ASC-derived factors
(secretome, ASC-S) improved myocardial function during recovery from cold ischemia, and almost completely
preserved normal expression of myocardial genes governing mitochondrial processes. A media supplement,
B27, with many similarities to hASC-S, ameliorated mitochondrial metabolic problems associated with cold
ischemic exposure of both rodent hearts and human iPS-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CM). Finally, both hASC-
S and B27 enhanced recovery of beating rate and velocity in hiPS-CM after DCD-like ischemia/reperfusion.
 Accordingly, the hypothesis that hASC-secretome will ameliorate warm ischemia/reperfusion-induced
deterioration of adult human and pig heart slice cultures in vitro, and model donor hearts ex vivo, by
mechanisms mediated by soluble factors as well as exosomes, which limit damage to cardiomyocytes
by preserving mitochondrial energetics and mitigating reactive oxygen species production and
apoptosis will be tested. To do that, three specific aims will be employed:
 Aim 1. Evaluate the protective effect of ASC-S on pig and human adult heart slices in long-term
culture in conditions modeling procurement and transport conditions of DCD hearts, and whether this
is best mediated by secretome, its components or B27. Slices of adult human or pig hearts exposed to warm
ischemia in vitro in the context of cardiac procurement will be incubated with either ASC-S, or ASC-S derived
exosomes, the exosome-free fraction or B27. Time and dose-dependent effects of treatments will be evaluated
on apoptosis, infarct area, beat recovery and markers of cell damage. The optimally performing preparation will
be studied in Aims 2 and 3.
 Aim 2. Evaluate the protective effects of extracorporeal infusion of ASC-S or its component on normal
pig donor heart preservation during cold static storage following donation after circulatory death (DCD).
ASC-S or its components preservation of normal pig hearts ex vivo will be tested as a preclinical model of DCD
organ procurement and transport. Heart function will be assessed in a Langendorff preparation.
 Aim 3. Establishment of the biochemical mechanisms by which ACS-S preserves cardiomyocyte
bioenergetics Using a comprehensive suite of biochemical diagnostics (physiological assessment of OXPHOS
conductance via high-resolution respirometry, dehydrogenase activity, mitochondrial membrane potential,
hydrogen peroxide emission and scavenging and activity of mitochondrial enzymes), we will define the
biochemical mechanisms for improved cardiomyocyte energetics with ASC-S treatment in human and pig heart
slice cultures and porcine hearts."

Background. Sexual and gender minorities (SGM) experience among the largest mental health disparities of
any population, at substantial cost to society. One driver has been the lack of evidence-based practice (EBP)
addressing the distinct mechanisms underlying SGM's risk. For 10+ years, our team has developed LGBTQ-
affirmative cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) as the first and only EBP specifically for SGM mental health,
now in high demand. This proposal seeks to study optimal means of implementing this effective treatment at
LGBTQ community centers nationwide to advance implementation science and health equity. Pilot Studies.
Our pilot data across 50 LGBTQ community centers shows that (1) training can improve providers' LGBTQ-
affirmative CBT skills, (2) directors of LGBTQ centers unanimously support this training, (3) providers perceive
that ongoing supervision can help maintain implementation but that receiving learning materials is also
invaluable. Still, knowledge gaps remain for implementation science, including: (1) whether train-the-trainer
strategies can further sustain implementation, (2) whether features of low-resource settings (e.g., high staff
turnover) predict optimal implementation strategies, and (3) the target mechanisms through which EBP training
impacts implementation and client outcomes. The proposed research will answer these questions. Method.
Drawing on our long-standing partnership with the US's coordinating hub of LGBTQ community centers, in this
type 3 hybrid trial we will randomize 90 centers to receive one of three strategies for implementing LGBTQ-
affirmative CBT to compare their effectiveness (Aim 1), identify center-level moderators of implementation
success (Aim 2), and examine the impact of the three strategies on client mental health through theory-
informed organizational and provider mechanisms (Aim 3). Drawing on social learning theory, mental health
research in low-resource settings, and our pilot data, we will compare three implementation strategies: (1) a
suite of digital learning materials (materials only condition); (2) these materials plus weekly webinar training for
12 weeks (direct training condition); or (3) the above plus 1-year of supervision from a local supervisor who will
receive expert consultation in a train-the-trainer format (local supervision condition). Implementation outcomes
will include objectively coded provider fidelity in LGBTQ-affirmative CBT and mixed methods assessments of
its reach, adoption, and maintenance across centers. Effectiveness outcomes will include client depression
symptoms. Hypotheses. We hypothesize that the three additive training strategies will predict respective
graduated increases in implementation success up to 2 years post-training. We hypothesize center-level
determinants of implementation success from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. We
hypothesize organizational and provider factors that will mediate the stronger impact of the more intensive
training strategies on implementation success and client mental health. Dissemination. We will distribute
scenario-based recommendations and budget impact to encourage maintenance across US LGBTQ centers."
10931460,"Project 2: Abstract
The hypothesis guiding this proposal is that mutations in hamartoma syndrome genes (PTEN, LKB1, TSC1,
TSC2) dominantly rewire metabolism exposing unique vulnerabilities. The focus of this project is to better
understand the molecular and biochemical basis for the metabolic vulnerabilities and provide preclinical data
that would support the development of biomarker driven clinical trials to evaluate such drugs in patients with
germline or the many tumors containing sporadic mutations in hamartoma syndrome genes. We have
decoded the optimal substrate motif for every single mammalian protein kinase in the last funding period and
made an algorithm that allows us to decode which kinases are active or inactive in a given biological samples
based on unbiased phospho-proteomics. Here we will focus on use of this new method to identify new
metabolic enzymes targeted by LKB1-dependent kinases. The specific aims are: 1) Defining critical kinase-
substrate interactions deregulated in hamartoma genes in cell lines and tissues; 2) Defining metabolic
vulnerabilities deregulated in hamartoma genes in cell lines and tissues; and 3) Defining how AMPK control of
TFEB contributes to the survival of hamartoma cells and how to target tumors based on new understanding of
this pathway."
10892255,"Project Summary/Abstract
 G protein coupled receptors are essentially the molecular messengers of the cell,
transducing signals from outside to inside. The signals are remarkably diverse, including a single
photon, ion like calcium, neurotransmitters and hormones. Humans have more than 800 GPCRs
for recognizing different signals, but only three types of transducers, G proteins, GPCR kinases
(GRKs) and arrestins. GRKs phosphorylate GPCRs whereas G proteins and arrestins directly
bind GPCRs, send the signal to downstream effectors and cause a cellular response. Comparing
structures of GPCR bound to G protein and arrestin will provide valuable insights into the
functional selectivity and guide the design of more potent drugs with better safety profiles. There
are currently >300 structures of GPCR−G protein complex reported but only 8 published
structures of GPCR−arrestin complex, which highlights the relative difficulty in obtaining suitable
arrestin complexes for structural analysis. My lab focuses on the understudied GPCR−arrestin
signaling pathway. We have developed a novel tool which stabilizes GPCR−arrestin complexes
for cryo-electron microscopy studies and used that to visualize how the atypical chemokine
receptor 3 engages arrestins in various ways at near-atomic resolution. For the next five years,
we plan to expand the study to many important GPCR−arrestin pairs to understand the structural
details to aid the design of selective interventions. This study will open the way to a detailed
dissection of the mechanism of arrestin-mediated GPCR signaling but also to structure-based
drug design."

Natural products (NPs) have diverse complex structures and play a vital role in drug discovery and development.
Although the rate of discovery of natural products has increased significantly, traditional bioactivity-guided
discovery methods frequently lead to the re-discovery of known compounds. Therefore, genetic information-
driven isolation is becoming a powerful tool to uncover novel NPs. Genome mining efforts that target genes
responsible for the biosynthesis of core structures of major NP classes, has identified tens of thousands of new
biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) families predicted to produce novel compounds. While this method has been
very successful in predicting compounds from these major classes, it is limited to those scaffolds and cannot
identify other specific features of NP structures. Furthermore, these methods will overlook “hidden” BGCs that
do not contain traditional core biosynthetic machinery, leaving a major gap in NP discovery. The first direction of
this proposal aims to use specialized genome mining strategies that target NP glycosyltransferases to identify
uncharacterized BGCs that produce bioactive glycosylated NPs with distinct core structures. Consequently,
identified compounds will be directly linked to their BGC and likely have biosynthetic pathways that consist of
unique enzymes and biochemical reactions. The second direction of this proposal is to interrogate the activities
and mechanisms of new biosynthetic enzymes. These will include enzymes discovered in direction one, along
with enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of the aminocyclitol found in hygromycin A, that contains a rare
modification essential for bioavailability. Subsequent re-integration of newly characterized biosynthetic enzymes
into standard or specialized genome mining methods will assist in annotating and identifying additional BGCs to
improve NP discovery. In addition, these enzymes will add to the growing toolbox of biocatalytic reactions
exploited for unnatural small molecule biosynthesis. Ultimately, this research program will significantly advance
NP and enzymology research to boost drug discovery and development for the benefit of human health."

Tuberculosis (TB) is prevalent in Uganda, and overlaps with an already high burden of HIV/TB coinfection. While
almost all hospital-based TB cases in Kampala city, the capital of Uganda, have clear TB symptoms, 30% or
more of the people with undiagnosed TB, identified through active case finding, are asymptomatic for TB;
moreover, the host risk factors for TB in Kampala cannot be distinguished from risk factors associated with the
environment. Complicating this further is the fact that anti-TB treatment failure rates are higher in Uganda by
several order of magnitude, compared to global estimates (17% vs. 10%). These TB-specific challenges depict
only a fraction of the complexity underlying the disease, especially in endemic settings with a high burden of
HIV/AIDS. Data science methods, especially Artificial Intelligence (AI) and/or Machine Learning algorithms, can
unravel such complexity and untangle factors of the host, pathogen and environment underlying TB, which
hitherto, have been difficult to explain or predict with conventional approaches. In this proposal, we will harness
health data science and elucidate factors underlying transmission of TB in a household, as well as anti-TB
treatment failure. We will leverage the computational infrastructure at Makerere, and available demographic,
clinical and laboratory data sets from TB patients and their contacts, and develop AI/Machine Learning
algorithms that identify: (1) Patients at baseline (month 0) who would not sputum and/or culture convert at months
2 and 5, hence are at risk of failing TB treatment, (2) Contacts of index-TB cases who are at risk of developing
household TB disease, as well as contacts who could be resistant to TB infection despite persistent and/or
multiple exposure to M. tuberculosis in a household. Answering these aims provides the required evidence that
data science methods are effective at early identification of potential TB cases and high-cost patients, hence
contribute to halting of TB transmission in the community."

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the leading cause of death in patients with cirrhosis, and the fastest rising
cancer mortality in the U.S. Due to the limited efficacy of existing therapies for established HCC tumors,
prognosis for patients remains poor, with five-year survival under 15%. Thus, HCC chemoprevention in cirrhosis
is likely the most impactful strategy to improve survival. However, despite the candidate chemopreventive agents
suggested in experimental studies, it remains an unmet need due to logistical difficulty in conducting clinical trials
that require large sample size and long follow-up time. To overcome the challenge, we identified Prognostic Liver
Secretome signature (PLSec) to quantitatively monitor therapeutic modulation of HCC risk level in cirrhosis
patients, and predict reduction of future incident HCC. PLSec has been used as a surrogate endpoint in our
ongoing and planned HCC chemoprevention clinical trials. Experimental studies in rodent models by us and
others suggested that epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a green tea catechin, prevents HCC development
without any adverse events. Our ex vivo organotypic culture of precision-cut liver slice (PCLS) from cirrhosis
patients revealed suppression of high-risk signature by EGCG, supporting its clinical relevance. Based on these
promising findings, the goal of our proposal is to test our hypothesis that EGCG treatment safely suppresses
PLSec in patients with cirrhosis. Aim 1. Evaluate safety and efficacy of EGCG in cirrhosis patients (phase II
double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial). We will evaluate 24-week EGCG treatment or placebo in 60
patients (1:1 randomization) with early-stage cirrhosis enriched for elevated HCC risk by a clinical variable-based
score (FIB-4 index) and PLSec. Participants will be monitored monthly for adverse events. Serum samples will
be obtained before, during, and at the end of treatment. Primary endpoint: reduction of risk level as measured
by PLSec (delta-PLSec). Secondary endpoints: safety profile, change in quality of life. Exploratory endpoints:
change in on-treatment PLSec, immunohistochemistry of HCC-risk-related markers for participants consented
for liver biopsy, and incident HCC. Aim 2. Identify factors associated with response to EGCG in cirrhosis patients.
We will evaluate pre-treatment PLSec and clinico-histological variables; on-treatment PLSec modulation and
plasma concentration of EGCG and its metabolites for their association with the primary endpoint. We will also
assess modulation of the FIB-4 index and liver stiffness measurement by acoustic elastography as potential
alternative clinical endpoints to monitor effect of EGCG, We expect to establish novel HCC chemoprevention
with a dietary supplement for subsequent pivotal phase III clinical trial toward clinical translation of this approach,
which will contribute to a transformative improvement in the outcome of patients with HCC by enabling individual-
risk-based, molecular-targeted, and safe chemoprevention of this deadly cancer."
10906198,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 As antibiotic resistance increases globally, there is an urgent need for new drugs to
combat bacterial infections. Approaches to developing new antimicrobials include inhibiting
essential steps in gene expression and inhibiting virulence factor production. The overarching
focus of the research program in my laboratory is to understand how bacterial cells
regulate gene expression, to ultimately identify novel targets for antimicrobial
development. The research funded by this award will leverage the Ramsey laboratory’s
expertise in bacterial genetics and state of the art technologies to examine the impacts of
ribosome heterogeneity in multiple bacterial species. The Ramsey laboratory identified a
specific homolog of the ribosomal protein bS21 that governs virulence gene expression in a
bacterial pathogen. These findings suggest that heterogeneity in ribosomes, which are significant
drug targets, can lead to changes in gene expression. The impacts of ribosome heterogeneity on
translation, gene expression, and drug efficacy are generally not well understood and represent
key gaps in our knowledge. Over the next five years, we propose to continue our studies to
understand the effects of ribosome heterogeneity on multiple bacterial species. The proposed
work is innovative because it takes a rigorous, reductionist approach to examine one poorly-
understood source of ribosome heterogeneity with species-specific impacts on translation to
elucidate fundamental features of translation and inform the design of novel antimicrobials. Our
goals include determining how multiple bS21 homologs function to govern gene expression, why
bS21 is essential in some cells, and how bS21 contributes to antibiotic sensitivity. We expect our
work will allow us to make clear connections between ribosome composition and functional
outcomes, as we will limit the complexity of ribosomal heterogeneity to changes in a single
ribosomal protein, bS21. Expected future work will include developing screens for novel, specific
ribosome inhibitors and studying the function of bS21 or other independent sources of ribosome
heterogeneity in these and/or other organisms. Ultimately our studies will provide key insights into
ribosome function, gene expression, and may identify novel targets for antimicrobial drugs."
10906907,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Epithelial stem cells reside in the major barrier tissues, governing homeostatic regeneration and injury repair. As
long-lived and indispensable cells, epithelial stem cells must endure bouts of inflammation. This ability is
especially critical during wound healing when many immune cells infiltrate the tissue. These immune cells play
important roles in controlling infections and clearing dead cells, but they also release toxic substances and create
a very harsh inflammatory environment for stem cells. It has long been assumed that stem cells are vulnerable
and must be protected within an ‘immune privileged’ niche. However, our recent study challenged this idea. We
have found that, upon wounding, the epithelial stem cells must be mobilized to exit their natural niche and migrate
into a highly inflammatory wounding environment for regenerating the damaged tissue. If stem cells failed to
adapt to inflammation, it could cause nonhealing wounds, which still affect millions of people worldwide, causing
significant economic and public health burdens. It is unclear how epithelial stem cells achieve self-renewal and
differentiation within an inflammatory environment while preventing collateral damage. Addressing this question
will transform our understanding of the fundamental biology underlying cellular fitness, stress tolerance, tissue
homeostasis, barrier integrity, and wound repair. Driven by its importance, the central question of this proposal
is to understand how epithelial stem cells adapt to the inflammatory environment and how this adaptive function
promotes wound repair. A significant gap in technology preventing a thorough understanding of wound healing
and stem cell adaptive functions is the lack of effective tools for rapid gene discovery and mechanistic studies in
mouse models. To overcome this hurdle, in this project, we will adopt an ultrasound-guided in utero microinjection
technique to establish a new experimental framework for rapid, functional, and mechanistic investigation of
genes involved in stem cell adaptation and wound healing directly in live mice. We will leverage this experimental
framework to deploy a full-fledged platform that will place us in a unique position to: first, design in vivo CRISPR
screening platforms and stem cell interactome sensors to dissect how epithelial stem cells can remodel the fate
and activities of surrounding immune cells to build a temporary protective niche, shielding stem cells from
inflammatory damage. Second, we will focus on devising an in vivo Perturb-seq-based framework and
cell/organelle tagging system to identify how epithelial stem cells reprogram their metabolism to tolerate
inflammation. In sum, this proposal has the potential to reveal critical information and build a solid foundation for
future efforts in developing strategies to manage non-healing wounds."

The overall objective of research being pursued in the Delmore lab is to understand the genetics of behavior
and speciation. Behavioral traits are tightly linked to fitness, human health, and disease but knowledge of their
genetic basis is limited and has been hindered by several challenges, including their complexity (e.g.,
integration of many traits that are mediated by tissue-specific pathways) and limited expression in captive
animal models. Similar gaps in our knowledge of speciation exist and relate to shortcomings in approaches
used to identify reproductive isolation at the genomic level. Evolutionary processes involved in speciation (e.g.,
adaptation, admixture and genomic conflict) are important for understanding individual- and population-level
patterns of human disease risk. The Delmore lab is using natural hybrid zones – areas where divergent
populations interbreed – and recent advances in genomics to overcome challenges associated with studying
the genetics of behavior and speciation. Recombination in hybrid zones isolates the effects of individual
genetic loci, providing an entry point to identify genetic variants underlying behavioral variation exhibited by
natural populations. Differences in behavior often help maintain species boundaries at hybrid zones, permitting
simultaneous work on speciation genetics, including new approaches for estimating reproductive isolation. The
Delmore lab has developed a migratory divide between songbirds as a model to understand the genetics of
seasonal migratory behavior and speciation. Migratory divides are hybrid zones between populations that differ
in several migratory traits (e.g., the timing and direction of migration). Migratory traits have a strong genetic
basis and differences in these traits help maintain species boundaries. The Delmore lab recently established
the infrastructure to quantify migratory traits reliably in both the field and lab. They can match these phenotypic
data with information from multiple molecular levels and specific brain regions. This system will be leveraged to
study the genetics of migration and speciation in the present proposal. An innovative multi-pronged approach
will be used, integrating results from admixture mapping and population genomics in natural populations with
laboratory examinations of gene regulation and functional analyses. By supplementing these results with
comparative analyses, members of the Delmore lab will test the generality of their findings and continue
identifying untapped avenues for future research. Together, these findings will provide unprecedented insight
into genetic mechanisms that shape seasonal behavior and speciation and address several fundamental
questions in evolutionary genetics, such as the role of pleiotropy in coordinating multiple traits, the sources and
types of genetic variation underlying phenotypic traits, the contribution of multi-locus interactions to speciation,
and whether molecular mechanisms of evolution are conserved across taxonomic scales."

Heterogeneous noble metal catalysts are commonly used in organic synthesis for the
hydrogenation of unsaturated organic functionality because of their fast reactivity and ease of
purification. However, heterogeneous catalysts tend to be poorly selective in the presence of other
reducible functionality and incapable of achieving stereoinduction due to the two-dimensional
nature of the catalyst surface. Taking inspiration from the homogeneous literature on substrate-
directed reactivity, the Li group recently demonstrated the first example of a heterogeneous
hydroxyl-directed hydrogenation. Using a bimetallic alloy catalyst containing a noble metal and a
base metal, we were able to catalyze highly diastereoselective hydrogenations of cyclic olefins
by simultaneously adsorbing the hydroxyl directing group onto the base metal atom and the olefin
onto the noble metal site.
The overarching goal of this proposed research is to demonstrate that directed reactivity using
bimetallic alloys is a general strategy to achieve chemo- and stereoselective hydrogenation of
drug-like compounds. These selective hydrogenation reactions will be utilized to increase the sp3
content, three-dimensionality, and structural diversity of pharmaceutical candidates. We will
develop new bimetallic nanoparticle compositions in order to extend the directed hydrogenation
concept to systems that are not accessible using molecular catalysts, including arenes and
heteroarenes, amine-directed reactions, and substrates where the directing group and reactive
moiety are located remote from one another. We will also explore directing effects in dictating
chemo- and regioselectivity in substrates where multiple reducible functional groups are
simultaneously present. In parallel with the development of synthetic methods, we will conduct
detailed nanomaterials characterization, in-situ surface spectroscopy, and kinetic studies in order
to elucidate the surface ensemble required for high directivity. Together, this research program
will provide new heterogeneous catalysts and methods for selective, late-stage transformations
in biologically-active compounds."

Our long-term goal is to identify the factors that contribute to effective mentorship networks for researchers from
underrepresented (UR) groups. Effective mentorship is critical for the retention of early career researchers in
academia. However, researchers from UR groups are less likely to have effective mentorship, which contributes
to disparities in grant funding and faculty representation. Current trends suggest that dyadic mentorship, which
is the most common form of mentorship, may not be the most effective form of mentorship, especially for
underrepresented groups, since it relies on one person to provide many aspects of academic and psychosocial
support. We hypothesize that mentorship networks, which involve multiple mentors with various roles, is a more
effective model than mentorship dyads for the retention and success of underrepresented researchers in
academia. How mentorship networks affect research success and what characteristics of a mentorship network
are important for early career UR researchers are not well-understood. We have developed a new tool called
Mentorship Network Analysis that assesses and maps the mentoring network of individuals. We will validate this
tool and retrospectively characterize successful mentoring networks of UR career development (K) grant
recipients. Then, we will test the feasibility of an intervention that helps UR researchers build effective mentoring
networks. Primary outcomes include mentor network robustness (i.e. the network is meeting the needs of the
trainee), career outcomes and intentions, and research success as measured by grants and publications.
Secondary outcomes include psychosocial predictors for research success (e.g. research self-efficacy) and
intervention acceptability and fidelity. After five years, we will better understand how the mentorship networks of
successful UR postdoctoral researchers form and change over time, their impact on career outcomes, and
patterns of UR mentorship networks critical for success. The findings will fill a critical need to understand how
best to mentor underrepresented trainees, informing investments in training grants and career development
programs that will close the mentoring gap in research training."

 Alkaloid natural products have had an immense impact on the field of therapeutic medicine,
and hold promise for the discovery of new neuropharmacological treatments. One area of
proposed research in the Smith Lab concerns the development of new psychoplastogenic
compounds based on the psychedelic lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Although derivatives of
LSD have been explored previously over many decades, derivatives bearing various substitutions
on the indole ring of the ergoline scaffold have never been explored. All of these derivatives are
currently only accessible through total synthesis, and potentially can serve as therapeutic leads
for various neuropsychiatric diseases including Parkinson's disease, PTSD, severe depression,
and addiction. Our concise synthetic approach to the scaffold of LSD hinges on the utilization
and chemical modification of widely available heterocyclic aromatic precursors. This strategy
allows for the exploration of chemical space that would otherwise be inaccessible, however
therapeutically enabling.
 Synthetic inspiration drawn from our route to these LSD analogs has led us to investigate the
synthesis of marine macrocyclic diamine alkaloids such as the halicyclamines and the sarains.
None of these targets have been synthesized previously. Our modular, yet redox-economic
platform for assembling these structurally complex compounds hinges on employing heterocyclic
starting materials at higher oxidation levels to efficiently access their congeners with lower redox
levels. Innovation in this research direction is mainly strategic, demanding a navigation of
synthetic assembly that has not been traversed previously. This will also demand tactical
advances in chemistry that will undoubtedly shed light on novel reactivity patterns that will be
broadly important within the realm of heterocyclic chemistry."
10900696,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Many proteins function by forming macromolecular assemblies. Describing the structures of these assemblies
in their cellular environment remains challenging. Traditional structural biology approaches may provide high-
resolution atomic structures but usually require purified samples and might describe only a few conformers. We
propose using data from in vivo genetic interaction and quantitative cross-linking mass-spectrometry (qXL-MS)
experiments to build structural models of protein assemblies, empowering the scientific community to address
structural questions that are currently out of reach of traditional structural biology methods. For example, genetic
interaction mapping by point-mutant epistatic miniarray profile (pE-MAP) platform and deep mutational scanning
(DMS) have emerged as powerful tools to interrogate proteins, at a residue resolution, in the context of their
biologically relevant functions. Similarly, in vivo qXL-MS approaches are well-suited to dissect physical
interactions between proteins, a full range of structural dynamics, and conformational changes at residue
resolution. Notably, in vivo genetic interaction and cross-linking experiments can be performed under varying
conditions to determine how protein functional states respond to changes in the cellular environment, a problem
difficult to approach by other methods. However, in vivo genetic interaction and cross-linking datasets are usually
noisy, sparse, and ambiguous, making structural interpretation challenging. To fully realize the potential of in
vivo genetic and physical interaction data, we need new computational methods that maximize the structural
information extracted from these datasets. Here, we propose a comprehensive research program to develop
tools to build integrative/hybrid structure models of stable and transient protein assemblies. We will focus on (1)
developing Bayesian scoring functions that objectively quantify the noise and ambiguity in the in vivo
experimental data, therefore increasing the accuracy and precision of the models; (2) building Bayesian
hierarchical models to represent the ensembles of protein assemblies, therefore allowing the application to
conformational and compositionally heterogeneous systems; and (3) creating validation tools to assess the
precision and accuracy of structural models obtained using in vivo data, therefore allowing judicious use of the
models. Finally, in close collaboration with experimentalists, we will apply these methods to determine the
structures of protein assemblies that have been refractive to traditional structural biology methods, including
vaccinia virus protein assemblies, TRIM5α bound to the HIV-1 capsid, and Ddis shuttling factors associated with
the proteasome. In conclusion, we will expand the scope of structural biology by increasing the variety of input
information used for integrative/hybrid structure modeling and thus allow structural modeling of biological
systems that are not amenable to traditional structural biology approaches. Our methods will be implemented in
the open-source Integrative Modeling Platform (IMP) software and contribute to the worldwide Protein Data Bank
(wwPDB) effort to validate, archive, and disseminate integrative structures."
10904984,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The mammalian heart possesses a poor ability to regenerate after myocardial infarction and heals via a fibrotic
repair response. Scar tissue increases the hemodynamic burden on the remaining cardiac muscle and over
time, the ventricle fails leading to the development of heart failure. Myocardial infarction contributes to almost
40-70% of all cases of heart failure and 700,000 patients are annually diagnosed with heart failure in the
United States alone. The main thrust of cardiovascular pharmacology for the treatment /prevention of heart
failure after heart attacks has centered on chronic antagonism of the sympatho-adrenal-angiotensin-
aldosterone axis (Beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, Angiotensin receptor blockers and aldosterone antagonists)
but despite available pharmacological therapies, the 5 year survival rate of heart failure is less than 50%.
There thus exists an immense unmet need to identify novel pharmacological strategies for the treatment and
prevention of heart failure.
We have recently demonstrated the role of a specific ectonucleotidase, ENPP1 (ectonucleotide
pyrophosphatase/ phosphodiesterase 1) in cardiac repair following myocardial infarction. ENPP1 is induced by
orders of magnitude after myocardial infarction and show that hydrolytic products generated by
ectonucleotidase activity contribute to inflammation and impair the cardiac injury response. Using genetic loss
of function approaches, we showed that inhibition of ENPP1 in the infarcted heart leads to decreased non-
myocyte cell death, decreased inflammation and significantly superior post infarct cardiac function.
Considering these observations, in collaboration with an antibody engineering biotech company, we in this
proposal have engineered a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting ENPP1 as a therapeutic biologic to
treat post infarct decline in cardiac function. We provide proof of concept efficacy studies demonstrating the
ability of the administered clinical candidate to modulate inflammation in the infarcted heart and lead to
significantly better preservation of post infarct function and decreased post infarct ventricular remodeling.
Further development of the monoclonal antibody combined with definitive preclinical studies in humanized
mice models as well as large animal infarct models forms the substance of the proposal. Using a variety of
“omics” approaches and genetically engineered mice, we will also interrogate in depth the downstream
pathways that are affected by the ENPP1mAb to exert salutary effects on cardiac repair and post infarct heart
function. If our studies are successful, the proposal will directly lead to the identification of a clinical monoclonal
antibody candidate to attenuate post infarct cardiac remodeling and dysfunction."

This research seeks to understand the fundamental process of protein translocation across membrane
barriers in bacteria. To establish an infection or exchange antibiotic resistance genes, bacteria must transport
macromolecules including protein across multiple membrane barriers: their own and the host cell’s.
In response to the universal requirement for macromolecule export, bacteria have evolved elaborate
machineries called secretion systems that use energy to move macromolecules from the bacterial cell out into
the extracellular milieu or directly into a host cell. In this proposal, I focus on the Type IV secretion system
(T4SS). This family of secretion systems is unique in that there are T4SSs that can transport nucleic acid
and/or protein cargo. As an important example of a T4SS, I will first investigate the defect in organelle
trafficking / intracellular multiplication (Dot/Icm) T4SS in Legionella pneumophila. This system is essential for
pathogenesis, which can result in the potentially fatal pneumonia Legionnaires’ Disease. The Dot/Icm T4SS is
composed of 30 proteins in different copy numbers. It secretes over 300 protein substrates in order to evade
the host cell’s immune system and scavenge nutrients. This represents a much larger repertoire of substrates
than observed in other secretion systems that transport proteins out of the bacterial cell. Thus, the Dot/Icm
T4SS is an ideal model system for determining how these numerous substrates are engaged and transported.
Protein transport by T4SSs has traditionally been studied using cell-based assays. The cellular environment,
however, does not allow for precise control and manipulation of reaction conditions. The field needs rigorous
biophysical assays with which to dissect the molecular mechanism of protein translocation. I propose to
combine determination of high-resolution structures of the Dot/Icm T4SS by cryoEM and
thermodynamics and enzyme kinetics studies of the system. These approaches will complement
traditional genetic and cell biological strategies and will lead to mechanistic insights into how this secretion
system transports protein. For example, transient state kinetics experiments observing the ATP-dependent
translocation of a fluorescently labeled substrate protein will answer questions such as “which signal
sequences are recognized by which motor protein(s),” “are protein substrates unfolded during transport,” and
“which kinetic steps are coupled to ATP binding and hydrolysis?”
This approach to investigating complex cellular machinery by integrating biochemical, biophysical, structural,
and genetic approaches will shed new light on the fundamental process of translocation across multiple
membranes, an important feature of bacterial pathogenesis. While this work aims to understand the
fundamental mechanism of protein translocation, our findings could lay the foundation for scientists to develop
anti-virulence drugs, the next generation of tools fighting bacterial disease, and to engineer the targeted
delivery of gene and protein therapeutics to eukaryotic cells by secretion systems."
10854905,"Prions are infectious protein-only zoonotic agents that can rapidly evolve in a new replication environment.
Prion strains are encoded by strain-specific conformations of PrPSc, the infectious form of the host-encoded
prion protein, PrPC. Collinge and Clarke hypothesized that prion strains are a mixture of a dominant prion strain
and substrains. In support of this hypothesis, we and others have shown: i) treatment of prions with anti-prion
drugs can result in the emergence of a drug resistant strain, ii) physical methods (e.g. thermostability) that
partially inactivate prions can select for prions with altered strain properties, and iii) strains within a given host
species can have different host ranges. Despite these data, direct evidence for the existence of preexisting
substrains is lacking and, consequently, the contributions of substrains to prion evolution has not been
explored. The long-term goal of this work is to prevent prion evolution to a new replicative environment. The
overall objective of this application is to determine the relative contributions of the dominant prion strain and
substrains to interspecies transmission of prions. In this application we will test the hypothesis is that prion
substrains drive prion transmission to a new PrP genotype. The hypothesis is based on our new discovery that
selective reduction of PrPSc from the biologically cloned hamster-adapted drowsy (DY) strain of transmissible
mink encephalopathy (TME), using two mechanistically different methods, allows for the emergence and
isolation of a preexisting substrain that is distinct from DY. Moreover, this substrain unexpectedly has a
different host range than DY TME. To test our hypothesis, we will first explore the frequency and diversity of
preexisting substrains from stable and unstable prion strains using complimentary methods (conformational
stability, protease digestion, thermostability) to selectively depopulate the dominant strain. The frequency and
diversity of substrains isolated will be determined using complementary in vitro prion detection methods and
animal bioassay. Second, we will explore the well-studied hamster/mouse species barrier using
complementary in vitro and in vivo methods to determine the relative contributions of the dominant strain and
substrains to interspecies transmission. The concept of strain interference between the dominant strain and
substrains will be tested in regards interspecies transmission. These studies are significant since it is critical to
understand the contributions of substrains to prion evolution as current prion treatment methods in
development (vaccination, anti-prion drugs, environmental mitigation procedures) target the dominant strain. It
is therefore possible that these methods will inadvertently result in the emergence of preexisting prion strains
with altered zoonotic potential and/or increased pathogenicity. Overall, these studies will directly test the
Collinge and Clark model of prion strain dynamics and will allow for a more precise evaluation potential of prion
strains to adapt to a new replication environment (e.g., chronic wasting disease transmission to humans)."
10907630,"Alcohol withdrawal (AW) after chronic alcohol exposure (AE) produces a series of symptoms. Among them,
generalized tonic-clonic seizures are the most severe and dangerous symptom. The severity and susceptibility
to relapse, and perpetuation of alcohol abuse underscore the urgent need to understand mechanisms underlying
alcohol dependence and AW in order to develop new therapeutic strategies to intervene and treat AW-associated
syndromes such as seizures. In this application, we will test the novel hypothesis that activity and connectivity
of hippocampal newborn dentate granule cells (DGCs) underlie AW-associated seizures. DGCs are principal
excitatory neurons that are continuously produced and integrate into hippocampal neural circuits, and altered
hippocampal neurogenesis has been implicated in seizures. Our previous studies have revealed the essential
roles of hippocampal newborn DGCs in the expressions of AW-associated seizures. AE reduced spine formation
while AW increased synaptic connectivity of hippocampal newborn DGCs. Our rabies virus-mediated retrograde
tracing study discovered altered neuronal connectivity of hippocampal newborn DGCs with both excitatory and
inhibitory neurons during AW seizures. Moreover, our functional study with a DREADD (Designer Receptors
Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs) method demonstrated that activity of hippocampal newborn neurons
plays an essential role in the expression of AW-associated seizures. These observations provided the theoretical
foundation for our hypothesis that altered neuronal connectivity and activity of hippocampal newborn DGCs
disrupts the balance of excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) signals, ultimately leading to AW-associated seizures. Thus,
the central goal of this proposal is to use novel mapping methods, imaging tools, and cellular and molecular
approaches in order to understand activity and connectivity of hippocampal neural circuits that are responsible
for AW-associated seizures. In Aim 1, we will determine whether AW alters neuronal and functional connectivity
of DGCs by using a rabies virus- and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-mediated retrograde and anterograde tracing
methods, respectively. We will also use multiple DREADDs and assess the essential role of de novo neural
circuits formed between hippocampal newborn DGCs and input neurons in AW-associated seizures. Aim 2, using
Ca2+ imaging and various magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities that allows us for longitudinal studies,
we will determine activity and connectivity of hippocampal and global neural circuits underlying AW-associated
seizures. In Aim 3, we will identify and validate transcriptome that may underlie altered synaptic and neuronal
connectivity of hippocampal newborn DGCs in response to AE and AW. The usage of single cell RNA sequencing
will allow us to not only register differentially expressed genes to cell type-specific manner, but determine
transcriptomes that distinguish pathological newborn DGCs from normal DGCs during AE and AW. Altogether,
our proposal will dissect the molecular, cellular, and neural circuitry mechanisms by which hippocampal newborn
DGCs underlie AW-associated seizures."

The genomic revolution has provided us with an “embarrassment of riches” with respect to our understanding of
the composition of gut microbial communities in disease, but we are still far from understanding how microbial
genes and pathways impact host health. While a wealth of studies show that the microbiome is associated with
disease states, we know little about the microbial genes that respond to disease-associated perturbations, such
as inflammation or drug therapy, and how these microbial responses contribute to disease and drug response.
Lack of knowledge of how microbial genes respond and contribute to disease-associated perturbations limits our
ability to rationally design microbiome-targeted therapies, such as fecal microbiota transplant, live
biotherapeutics, and small molecule microbial inhibitors. My lab’s long-term goal is to understand how the
microbiome contributes to the resolution of systemic inflammation. The overall objective of this R35 NIGMS
MIRA grant is to support the aspect of my research program focused on deciphering the microbial genetic
determinants of responses to inflammation and drug therapy and how these impact the host. With the support
of the R35 MIRA grant, over the next 5 years, I aim to establish a unique and productive niche at the intersection
of microbiology, genetics, and systemic inflammatory disease by investigating the following key questions /
themes: (1) which microbial genes are important for responding to host inflammation and drug treatment, (2)
how do these microbial genes subsequently contribute to host inflammation, and (3) can drugs targeting specific
microbial genes impact gut microbial ecology and evolution in the setting of host inflammation. The proposed
research program seeks to fill these knowledge gaps by harnessing cutting-edge technologies and my unique
backgrounds in computer science, genomics, microbiology, clinical immunology, and gnotobiology. The human
gut microbiome is with us “from here to eternity” but we are just beginning to uncover the powerful forces in vivo
that shape the microbial community and its evolution. The microbial genetic basis of these shifts in the setting of
inflammation and drug therapy is not commonly studied; filling this fundamental knowledge gap will pay dividends
in the future by improving the efficacy of therapeutic strategies that are currently underway in patients with
inflammatory disease."

Cell plasticity is the ability of cells to change their phenotypes without genetic mutations in response to
environmental cues. This cellular behavior is crucial for the development and progress of complex diseases,
such as immune responses and cancer. Changes in cellular transcription programs have long been considered
a major factor in defining the fate of cells during cell-type switching. However, the role that post-transcriptional
mechanisms can play in regulating cell fate, specifically in response to rapid changes in the environmental cues,
is a black box. A long-term goal of my laboratory is to identify the post-transcriptional mechanisms that regulate
protein synthesis and understand their contribution to cellular plasticity. Here, we focus on two areas of post-
transcriptional gene regulation: mRNA modifications and translational control. While there has been impressive
progress towards understanding the role of RNA modifications and translational regulation in controlling cellular
homeostasis, there is a significant gap in our knowledge of how these processes can rapidly affect cellular
plasticity in response to the changes in environmental cues. The eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) has emerged
as a master player in translation regulation by promoting or suppressing the translation of a subset of mRNAs.
However, how this key initiation factor controls cell plasticity is a mystery. Our data indicate that eIF3 is critically
important for morphological transition in the yeast Candida albicans. In Theme 1, we will address the role of eIF3
in controlling cell plasticity in C. albicans by answering two key questions: 1) What are the composition and the
interactome of eIF3 in different cell types of C. albicans? and 2) What is the role of C. albicans eIF3 in regulating
mRNA translation during the yeast-to-hyphae transition? Our second area of research (Theme 2) is focused on
understanding how RNA modifications regulate cell plasticity in C. albicans. Our work demonstrates that mRNAs
are differentially methylated in different cell types in C. albicans, and inhibiting the mRNA methylation impairs
cell plasticity in this organism. By combining novel genetic tools and reagents that we have recently developed
with biochemical assays, proteomics, and next-generation sequencing we will answer two key questions: 3)
What is the mechanism of m6A deposition in mRNA during cell-type switching in C. albicans? and 4) How do
m6A mRNA modifications contribute to cell-type switching in C. albicans? Our findings will provide significant
insights into the mechanisms of post-transcriptional control of cell plasticity at the mRNA or translation level and
will aid in understanding how dysregulation of these processes contributes to human disease."

program at the Albert Einstein College with a broad, interdisciplinary research emphasis designed to increase
understanding of biological processes and lays the foundation for advances in disease diagnosis, treatment, and
prevention. This application replaces a pre-existing program with support for 14 trainees (~7 appointed/year).
Over the past 15 years, our CMBG program graduated 84 PhD students, including 25 under-represented minority
students. More than 95% of graduates continued in science-related careers. Overall objectives are for students
to perform significant basic science research projects, to acquire rigorous scientific background and experimental
training, to develop and defend their PhD thesis in a timely manner, and to develop into independent scientists
who make long-term contributions in the biomedical sciences. Training faculty are selected based on research
excellence in Cell Biology, Molecular Biology, and Genetics, and on their commitment to mentor students and to
provide an outstanding and safe training environment. All but ESI faculty members have substantial mentoring
experience and funding; mechanisms are in place to assist junior faculty in mentoring students and to provide
additional oversight for students in their labs. Trainees enter Einstein through a single Graduate School portal.
They receive formal training in the responsible conduct of research and teaching. Students complete 3 research
rotations in the first year and undertake rigorous coursework, including CMBG-foundation courses organized
and taught by our Assoc. Directors and trainers. Students write a grant proposal-type qualifying exam based on
their PhD research and defend it orally to an interdisciplinary faculty committee. Students are reviewed by the
CMBG Advisory Committee after the first and second years and interviewed by the Program Director prior to
appointment for a proposed 2 years of funding. CMBG program activities build a coherent training effort in which
students participate until completion of the PhD. Trainees present their work yearly in an active work-in-progress
series and host an annual student-invited exceptional seminar speaker. Annual program retreats include talks
by senior students, posters, workshops, discussions of ethics and rigor, and presentations from CMBG alumni
to provide career perspectives. At all events, our CMBG trainers, Advisory Committee, Director, and Assoc.
Directors provide input on research directions, rigor of the experimental strategy, presentation skills, and
publication strategies. The CMBG Advisory Committee provides additional oversight on trainees’ progress, with
a committee member assigned to each trainee. These features make the program a vibrant, highly interactive
community of faculty and students involved in key basic science questions relevant to human health. Students
graduate with a required first-author publication (or submission), with the scientific background, research skills,
and critical thought process necessary for an independent career in science."
10931382,"Abstract:
 Spike glycoprotein (S-protein) is one of the viral transmembrane proteins on the envelope of severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). S-
protein plays a crucial role in mediating the initial entry of viral genome into the host cell by binding to the human
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and then inducing fusion between the virus envelope and cell
membrane. Thus, S-protein is a target of choice for diagnostic and therapeutic assays, including neutralizing
monoclonal antibodies (nAbs). To date, the conformations of S-protein and its molecular assemblies with ACE2
and/or nAbs have been mainly determined by structural techniques, including crystallographic and electron
microscopic methods. These structural studies allow us to understand the molecular basis underlying viral entry
and to further develop treatment and preventive therapeutics for COVID-19. However, these resolved structures
are rather “static snapshots” compared to the dynamic nature of proteins in physiological conditions. Due to the
technical difficulties, our knowledge about the real-time structural dynamics of S-protein and its real-time
interactions with host receptors, nAbs, and the other relevant biomolecules, which may have functional
significance, is still very limited.
 In this proposal, my lab will develop a bio-mimicking reconstitution system and apply a cutting-edge
structural imaging technique, high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM), for real-time observations of S-
protein’s structural dynamics in close-to-native environments and under various conditions. We will also develop
novel methods to quantitatively characterize the architecture of molecular assemblies comprising S-protein,
ACE2 receptor, nAbs, host proteases and enzymes, and biological membranes, which can mediate the
membrane fusion and viral entry processes. Specifically, we will identify the “real-time” structural dynamics of S-
protein in different states and visualize how the state transitions happen, for example, during ACE2 binding,
nAbs attachment, and the structural cleavages in S-protein subunits. My lab will further develop correlated
fluorescence microscopy and HS-AFM to study these dynamic events associated with S-protein on the
mammalian cell surface. The biophysical and biochemical information acquired in our proposed experiments will
provide a comprehensive molecular understanding of the conformational states of S-protein, intermolecular
interactions between S-protein and binding molecules (ACE2 and nAbs), the conformational changes in S-
protein for initiating membrane fusion processes for viral entry, and how the mammalian cell surface impacts the
S-protein. The developed methods here can further apply to the other receptor-mediated membrane fusion
systems for cell entry."
10702046,"Since 2001, more than 2.2 million US veterans have served in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF)
in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) in Iraq. The Gulf Registry of the VA Environmental
Epidemiology Service identified the majority of these veterans as having chronic health complaints of
undetermined etiology. Among the symptoms most frequently reported by veterans with Gulf War
Illness (GWI) were chronic fatigue, frequent or persistent headache, frequent or persistent muscle or
joint pain, and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. GI symptoms (e.g., diarrhea, bloating, and abdominal
pain) reported by these veterans accounted for most complaints. Indeed, up to 33% of veterans with
GWI suffer from chronic GI symptoms.
 We have shown that veterans with GWI and GI symptoms have increased intestinal permeability
that drives GI symptoms (Zhang et al., 2019). Our research group recently completed a clinical trial
demonstrating the effectiveness of oral glutamine supplementation in diarrhea-predominant IBS
patients with increased intestinal permeability (Zhou et al., 2019). We now have obtained preliminary
evidence that oral glutamine supplementation may restore intestinal permeability in veterans with GWI
and GI symptoms. Based on these new findings, we hypothesize that oral glutamine supplementation
will improve the Symptom Severity Scale and restore intestinal permeability in veterans with GWI and
chronic GI symptoms. We propose to conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical
trial studying oral glutamine supplementation compared to placebo in veterans with GWI and GI
symptoms.
 The human GI tract is the major site of glutamine utilization in the body. Glutamine is a major
energy source for rapidly dividing intestinal mucosal cells of the digestive tract. Glutamine helps to
protect the lining of the GI tract. Its depletion results in epithelial atrophy and a subsequent increase in
intestinal permeability. Glutamine supplementation has been shown to decrease bacterial translocation
and intestinal permeability after intestinal injury. Glutamine supplementation has also been shown to
decrease intestinal permeability and improve GI function in patients with Crohn’s disease, advanced
esophageal cancer, or metastatic cancer undergoing radio chemotherapy. There are no published
studies to date to support the use of glutamine for veterans with GWI and chronic GI symptoms.
However, given our published studies, preliminary data demonstrating restoration of intestinal
permeability with oral glutamine therapy, and the mechanisms of action of glutamine on the GI tract,
research testing whether oral glutamine is an effective therapy in veterans with GWI is needed. Given
that there are no effective treatments for these veterans and that current treatment approaches are far
from ideal, this proposed clinical trial would be extremely important as it would not only have a
beneficial impact on the health of many of our veterans, but also it would substantially reduce the
negative economic effects on the VA Health Care System."
10916266,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Even with recent advances in synthetic biology, it remains a major challenge in developing genetic circuits
that involve multiple inputs and outputs. This is because natural genetic systems are only capable of
connecting one single chemical input to one specific promoter to control gene expression. This poses a
significant barrier in creating engineered organisms with complex signal response behavior for biomedical
applications. The long-term goals of this research team are to establish robust strategies for constructing
biological parts of genetic circuits, and to use these parts to expand researchers’ ability in engineering new
cellular functions for biomedical applications. In their recent progress, the team established a module swapping
strategy for building genetic sensors from regulators in the LacI and TetR families and they harnessed these
engineered sensors to develop several novel genetic circuits. The two directions in this proposed research
represent important steps toward the team’s long-term goals in the next five years. The first direction is to
advance the capabilities in engineering transcriptional regulators as modular biosensors. Specifically, the team
plans to 1) establish design principles of modifying regulators for enhancing their performance as biosensors
and 2) apply module swapping to a wide range of regulator families. The central hypothesis is that each
regulator within a family contains a ligand-binding module (LBM) and a DNA-binding module (DBM) for the
purpose of detecting an input signal and for interacting with a promoter, respectively; if key module-module
interactions are maintained, LBMs and DBMs from different regulators can be mixed and matched to create
hybrid regulators with new combinations of input sensing and DNA recognition properties. For their second
direction, the team proposes to harness hybrid regulators to explore novel circuit designs in various organisms,
aiming to meet emerging needs in biomedical fields. This effort includes developing cellular devices to
continuously and simultaneously monitor a range of toxic pollutants, which provides a means to assess the
intake of toxicants that are commonly found in contaminated food and water. As an Early Stage Investigator,
the PI and his team have already generated significant progress on both proposed directions, showing that
they are highly qualified to pursue the proposed projects. The contribution of this project is expected to be the
establishment of design principles for creating modular parts from regulators in many families and the
advancement in genetic circuit design and implementation. This contribution will be significant because it is
expected to release many new possibilities in circuit topologies for biomedical uses, including monitoring
devices that will be created in this program. The overall approach is innovative because it represents a new
way of using protein engineering and cellular engineering approaches to enhance public health and safety.
Therefore, the proposed work is expected to generate positive impacts at both scientific and societal levels."

Stroke is a prevalent and devastating disease with limited therapeutic options. Inflammation and
immune cells are major components in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke and contribute to acute
and delayed tissue injury. However, our incomplete understanding of the factors regulating the immune
responses triggered by cerebral ischemia remains a significant obstacle to the development of effective
therapeutic interventions based on modulating post-ischemic inflammation. Besides activation of brain
resident immune cells, ischemic stroke is characterized by the recruitment of peripheral innate and
adaptive immune cells that participate in the inflammatory response and contribute to the damage.
Commensal microbiota that populate epithelial surfaces play a defining role in shaping the immune
system, the development, maintenance and function of which depends critically on the relative
abundance and composition of the different microbial species. In particular, intestinal commensal
bacteria, the most abundant symbiotic compartment in the body, have emerged as a potent regulator of
the immune response to stroke. The long-term goal of this research program is to elucidate the role of
intestinal microbiota in stroke pathobiology and develop the experimental framework for new
preventative and therapeutic approaches for ischemic stroke. In the present application, we will test the
hypothesis that the interaction of commensal intestinal microbiota with dendritic cells is a critical
determinant of stroke outcome by modulating the immune system and inflammatory response to
cerebral ischemia. Supported by relevant preliminary results, this application will test the hypothesis
that commensal intestinal microbiota modulate stroke outcome by acting on intestinal dendritic cells to
either induce a tolerogenic or pro-inflammatory phenotype affecting T cell differentiation. These
intestinal immune changes propagate to the brain and meninges after stroke by increased immune cell
trafficking. To this end, we will determine (a) the roles of different dendritic cell populations in mediating
the neuroprotective effects of altered microbiota and (b) the cellular and molecular targets of microbiota
that lead to altered intestinal immunity and their importance for stroke outcome. These goals will be
achieved using a mouse model of transient focal cerebral ischemia with assessment of histological and
neurological outcome, a model of altered gut bacteria, cell tracking of intestinal immune cell, and in vitro
immune cell coculture models. This proposal may open the way to new avenues for stroke prevention
and therapy based on modulation of the immune system by the gut microbiota."
10835048,"Acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening condition which affects
~200,000 Americans each year with 10-15% of intensive care admissions and a mortality rate of ~ 25-40%.
Sepsis is a prominent extrapulmonary cause of ALI in humans. Nearly 50% of patients with severe sepsis
develop ALI/ARDS. All current therapies for ALI/ARDS still rely on supportive care; thus, there is an urgent need
to develop new treatment strategies for ALI/ARDS that are safe and effective. Because endothelial cell (EC)
barrier dysfunction is an early and critical component of ALI in sepsis, a better understanding of the mechanisms
of EC permeability is key to developing effective therapy for ALI. The goal of this proposal is to understand how
aberrant communication between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrion in sepsis, mediated by ER
chaperone BiP/GRP78 and mitochondrial (MITO) chaperone Mortalin/GRP75, promotes EC barrier dysfunction
to cause ALI. Our hypothesis is that a close interaction and functional cooperation between BiP/GRP78 and
Mortalin/GRP75 at the MAMs (mitochondrial associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes) serves to increase
cytosolic Ca2+ and ER-MITO contact sites to cause mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and inflammasome activation,
leading to lung vascular injury in sepsis. We further hypothesize that targeting BiP/GRP78 and Mortalin/GRP75
in combination may prove a superior therapeutic approach against sepsis-induced ALI and mortality. The
proposal is based on our novel findings that BiP/GRP78 and Mortalin/GRP75 are key regulators of Ca2+ signaling
and ER-MITO contact sites in EC and silencing BiP/GRP78 or Mortalin/GRP75 each prevents EC barrier
disruption caused by plasma from septic patients and other clinically relevant edemagenic agonists such as
thrombin and LPS. BiP/GRP78 is induced in septic lung and overexpressing BiP/GRP78 in the resting lung
endothelium is sufficient to cause lung injury in mice. Moreover, inhibiting BiP/GRP78 or Mortalin/GRP75 each
mitigates ALI in mice. Importantly, combined inhibition of BiP/GRP78 or Mortalin/GRP75 is far more effective
(requires ~5-fold less dose of BiP/GRP78 or Mortalin/GRP75 inhibitors) in improving survival in mice with sepsis.
The proposal will address the following aims. Aim 1 will determine the role of BiP/GRP78 and Mortalin/GRP75
in regulating cytosolic Ca2+ to cause EC permeability. Aim 2 will determine the role of BiP/GRP78 and
Mortalin/GRP75 in increasing ER-MITO contact sites and mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake to cause mitochondrial
dysfunction and inflammasome activation leading to EC permeability. Aim 3 will determine (i) the contribution of
endothelial BiP/GRP78 and Mortalin/GRP75 in causing lung injury, and (ii) assess the therapeutic potential of
inhibiting BiP/GRP78 and Mortalin/GRP75 together against sepsis-induced ALI and mortality. These studies will
provide valuable insight into the ER-MITO communication and its relevance in the pathogenesis of ALI and may
lead to development of a safe and efficacious therapeutic strategy that relies on combined inhibition of
BiP/GRP78 and Mortalin/GRP75 to control ALI and improve survival in sepsis."

Circular dichroism (CD) and Raman optical activity (ROA) are chiroptical spectroscopies that provide valuable
structural information about biomolecules and pharmaceuticals under native conditions in aqueous buffer without
the need for special sample preparation or crystallization. The two methods are complementary as they probe
the circular dichroism of molecular electronic and molecular vibrational transitions, respectively. A combination
of the two methods is particularly well suited for investigating the structure of membrane binding proteins, which
remain very difficult to characterize with other biophysical characterization tools. Although in theory a combined
CD / ROA characterization has the potential for providing important structural information of membrane binding
proteins, in practice the weak sensitivities of the two spectroscopies makes it difficult to realize this potential. A
need for high sample concentrations and long acquisition times has limited a more widespread use of CD and
in particular ROA spectroscopy as tool for characterizing membrane binding proteins. This project intends to
overcome the sensitivity limitations of CD and ROA spectroscopies by developing plasmon-enhanced CD
(PECD) and surface-enhanced ROA (SEROA) spectroscopies that utilize plasmonic nanoantennas, which are
engineered nanostructures with specific electric (E) and magnetic (H) field properties as well as defined phase
properties, to enhance signal intensities. To maximize the signal enhancement, antenna substrates will be
developed with plasmon resonances in the ultraviolet (UV) so that the electromagnetic resonances can overlap
with the molecular electronic resonances of biological target molecules, facilitating strong signal intensities for
both CD and ROA. As this proposal focuses on developing PECD and SEROA as characterization tool for
membrane binding proteins, another important design component of the proposed antennas is the assembly of
a lipid membrane on the surface of the plasmonic nanoantennas to provide binding sites for membrane binding
proteins. This approach enriches the proteins of interest in electromagnetic hot spots where CD and ROA signal
enhancements are highest and allows for a spectroscopic characterization of the protein structure in its
membrane-bound form. The developed plasmon-enhanced spectroscopies will enable important new insights
into the structure and chirality of membrane-binding proteins, for instance as function of lipid compositions, and
will contribute to a greatly improved understanding of protein-membrane interactions. The specific aims of this
application are to:
Aim 1: Develop a Plasmon-Enhanced Ultraviolet CD Spectroscopy for Membrane Binding Proteins
Aim 2: Develop Plasmon Enhanced Raman Optical Activity (ROA) Spectroscopy for Membrane Binding Proteins
Aim 3: Prototype Combined Electronic CD / ROA Instrument for the Characterization of Membrane Binding

The fundamental hypothesis driving this exploratory R21 (FOA PA-21-200) is that maternal sleep apnea during
pregnancy causes maternal immune activation (MIA), resulting in multiple cognitive and social deficits that
emerge in juvenile stages and persist into adulthood. Sleep apnea is characterized by recurrent partial or
complete cessation of breathing during sleep that causes pathologic drops in blood oxygen levels (intermittent
hypoxia; IH), often hundreds of times each night. Each year, over half a million women have untreated sleep
apnea during pregnancy, in part due to insufficient screening, or a lack of patient compliance to sleep apnea
therapy. Although detrimental effects of maternal sleep apnea during pregnancy on the perinatal health of the
mother and her newborn have recently become appreciated, little is known about the impact of maternal SA on
the long-lasting health of her offspring. We developed an experimental model of sleep apnea in pregnancy by
exposing pregnant rats to a pattern of IH that mimics sleep apnea in humans. Our findings indicate that offspring
exposed to intermittent hypoxia during gestation (GIH) exhibit significant increases in neuronal spine density in
the medial prefrontal cortex, and behavioral impairments, including memory and social deficits that manifest in
juveniles, and persist into adulthood. Strikingly, GIH-induced behavioral deficits are more prominent in male
offspring whereas females are only slightly (or not at all) affected. Although the revealed behavioral deficits
individually typify several neuropsychiatric disorders of relevance to human health, the combination of enhanced
cortical synaptic connectivity, the early onset and persistence of behavioral dysfunction, and the comparative
severity of phenotypes in males suggests a possible autism-relevancy to our findings. Evidence indicates that
MIA during pregnancy is associated with increased offspring risk of autism spectrum disorder. In this proposal,
we will begin to test the hypothesis that maternal sleep apnea during pregnancy induces activation of the
maternal immune response that is a key initiator of the ensuing neuronal and behavioral impairments in her
offspring. IH causes chronic inflammation in humans and animal models, and it underlies much of the pathology
associated with sleep apnea in non-pregnant individuals. Intriguingly, many of the cytokines increased by sleep
apnea are the same as those associated with offspring neurological dysfunction in models of MIA.
Our preliminary data indicate that GIH upregulates IL-17a in the GIH male (but not female) placenta and in
maternal serum, a cytokine well known to orchestrate autism-like behaviors in offspring of mothers exposed
to other models of MIA. Our data therefore suggest that GIH may be an unrecognized trigger for MIA that
leads to a constellation of deficits in offspring that resemble behavioral and synaptic abnormalities in
humans with autism spectrum disorder. They also point to IL-17a as the culprit. If our hypotheses
are correct, our findings would be transformative and would inform physicians and patients alike to
perform early and consistent screening for SA in pregnancy to minimize neural damage to the unborn baby."

This application is responsive to NOT-DA-20-039: Effects of Cannabis Use and Cannabinoids on the Devel-
oping Brain. Prenatal cannabis use is common and increasing, with rates as high as 1 in 4 in poor, young,
underserved women. Expanding legalization of cannabis has led to increasing availability, use, perceptions of
safety as well as increased potency. However, data is lacking regarding the impact of prenatal use of increase-
ed-potency cannabis on offspring neurodevelopment. Our group is currently conducting an intensive, prospective
investigation of the impact of maternal prenatal cannabis use on infant neurodevelopment (R01DA044504). Our
ongoing study has yielded preliminary evidence for an impact of prenatal cannabis on offspring growth and
neurodevelopment, but does not involve a comprehensive interrogation of genomic pathways underlying these
associations. Pinpointing genomic pathways will allow us to identify biomarkers of fetal harm and develop
novel screening tools and intervention targets to protect and treat exposed offspring. The placenta is a
unique organ that regulates the intrauterine environment, maternal-fetal communication--including passage of
cannabinoids--and plays a critical role in supporting fetal growth and neurodevelopment. Seminal work by our
group has revealed that the prenatal environment impacts placenta function, that alterations in placenta function
can be informed by genomic profiling of the placenta, and that alterations in placenta genomic profiles are linked
to newborn growth and neurobehavior. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an understudied aspect of placenta epigenetic
regulation; miRNAs are short non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally and are crit-
ical regulators of placental- and neuro-development. A recent initial study supports the hypothesis that maternal
cannabis may impact placenta immune gene networks, and offspring anxiety, but was not designed to investigate
prenatal cannabis, only included a small number of cannabis users, and did not include miRNA. We propose a
comprehensive placenta miRNA and mRNA profiling study to define the impact of prenatal cannabis
exposure on placenta genomic activity and infant neurodevelopment. We test the central hypothesis that
prenatal cannabis exposure leads to unique alterations in placenta endocannabinoid, neuronal development,
immune, and stress signaling pathways, and that these functional genomic features will also impact infant de-
velopment. We leverage our ongoing cohort (n=100 cannabis users, n=100 non-users) designed to assess the
impact of prenatal cannabis on infant neurodevelopment and including placenta collection for candidate methyl-
ation assays. Our proposed genomic mechanisms study involves the addition of state-of-the-art whole transcrip-
tome RNA-sequencing (mRNA and miRNA) to delineate the functional impacts of prenatal cannabis exposure
and links to infant development. Determining genomic profiles underlying the impact of prenatal cannabis on
infant development is timely and offers potential to identify biomarkers of exposure and offspring risk as well as
molecular targets for future intervention efforts."

The escalating prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors including obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus
(T2DM) presents a critical cardiovascular challenge. Individuals with cardiometabolic disease harbor greater
risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) including accelerated vascular aging and premature atherosclerotic
disease. Importantly, alterations in endothelial function predate the development of clinical CVD, making the
vascular endothelium an important potential target for cardioprotection. Experimental studies and our prior
work link altered metabolism to organelle stress including mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress. In this
proposal, we hypothesize that organelle stress induced by cardiometabolic traits drives vascular dysfunction
and promotes CVD. We will leverage the unique resources of the planned Framingham Heart Study fourth
examination cycle to prospectively collect fresh human endothelial cells (EC) from 2000 individuals. In Aim 1,
we will investigate the association of T2DM and cardiometabolic traits with EC phenotype including organelle
stress and nitric oxide signaling in a nested case-control sample of 450 individuals. In Aim 2, we will measure
EC gene expression levels using RNA sequencing in 900 participants to identify and prioritize EC
transcriptional programs linked to EC health phenotypes, cardiometabolic traits, and systemic metabolism. This
proposal leverages a unique and highly experienced multidisciplinary team of investigators with expertise in
obesity-related cardiovascular disease, endothelial biology, population science, translational patient-oriented
research, multi-omics and bioinformatics. The proposed work will dwarf past efforts at defining endothelial
health across disease states and will combine new deep phenotyping of EC conducted at scale in a
community-based cohort with existing rigorous measures of cardiovascular health including metabolite profiles
and genomic markers. These studies have the potential to provide important insights into mechanisms driving
endothelial dysfunction and develop an unprecedented resource that will benefit vascular biology research."

Impressive advances in gene discovery in the auditory system have occurred in the last decades, making specific
targeted approaches for therapeutics realistic goals of great interest in the field of hearing and deafness. Hearing
loss (HL) is an increasingly significant health problem in populations worldwide, with a substantial proportion due
to genetic causes. Given the health burden and ongoing rapid discoveries, it is now essential to pursue new
strategies for specific early interventions that could prevent or mitigate severity and progression of HL. One such
disorder is DFNA9, an adult-onset sensorineural HL with balance dysfunction, caused by mutations in COCH,
encoding cochlin, the most abundantly detected protein in the inner ear. This disease model is similar to and
representative of the majority of genetic HL disorders with a dominant mode of inheritance and with a deleterious
gain-of-function of the mutant protein.
Aims 1 and 2 of this proposal involve utilization of the powerful and versatile CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing
technology for specific targeting and disruption of the dominant missense pathogenic COCH variants p.G88E
and p.A449T. We will utilize human fibroblasts from patients with these two variants, and derived pluripotent
stem cells and organoids. These biological resources will serve as tools for the development of effective methods
for allele-specific gene disruption of the COCH pathogenic variants, while leaving the normal allele intact and
functional. The organoids will be assessed as a possible in vitro system for elucidating the biology of COCH
aggregates pathognomonic of DFNA9 temporal bones. Furthermore, we will utilize two Coch knock-in (KI) mouse
models with these variants for implementation of somatic tissue gene targeting in the inner ear. These
approaches will establish methodologies for gene editing not only for DFNA9, but also for a broader category of
other HL disorders with a dominant gain-of-function mechanism of pathology, with the ultimate goal of translation
to clinical trials and therapeutic intervention."

The development of therapeutic drugs to cure obesity has not been successful due to unwanted side effects
and limited efficacy. My long-term research goal is to delineate neural pathways responsible for body weight
homeostasis, and provide a framework for effective and specific therapeutics against obesity. Research in the
last decades has identified arcuate neurons in the hypothalamus expressing agouti-related protein (AgRP) as a
key node in feeding. Recently, we and others demonstrate that chronic activation of AgRP neurons or adult
deletion of leptin receptors in these neurons leads to massive obesity on chow diet that is comparable to leptin
deficiency. AgRP neurons are known to release GABA, NPY and AgRP and send independent and parallel
projections to several key brain sites. Importantly, the expression of leptin receptor has been suggested to be
more prominent in those AgRP neurons that project to extra-hypothalamic areas. However, how the
neurotransmitters and the individual AgRP neuron projections mediate the obesity produced by chronic
activation of AgRP neurons are unknown. Additionally, how the individual AgRP neuron projections mediates
leptin action on obesity is also unknown
To address these knowledge gaps, we aim to examine the role of AgRP individual neurotransmitters (Aim 1),
projection-specific subpopulations of AgRP neurons (Aim 2) and their LepR expression (Aim 3) in mediating
the obesity development produced by chronic AgRP neuron activation. Advanced viral tracing and
intersectional mouse genetics will be used to achieve projection-specific manipulations in AgRP neurons to
achieve robust investigation. This proposal is based on our previously established massive obese mouse
models with chronic AgRP neuron activation or LepR deletion in AgRP neurons, and utilizes a combination of
inducible deletion and tracing to ex-amine the relative importance of individual transmitters and projections in
obesity development. The results will fill the gap in the underlying neurocircuit mechanism for AgRP neurons
on obesity development and will set up stages to identify key downstream mediators and neurons mediating
leptin and AgRP neurons in obesity development, representing a significant step in understanding brain
mechanisms in body weight regulation."

The introduction of new targeted therapies and immunotherapies has led to significant decreases in lung cancer
mortality in the United States in recent years. However, lung cancer continues to kill over 135,000 Americans
each year, and over a million people annually world-wide. Thus, there remains an urgent need to continue to
improve the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of this deadly disease.
 Our research focuses on lung adenocarcinoma, the most common form of lung cancer. Lung
adenocarcinoma is, at its root, a disease of the genome. The focus of my laboratory is to understand somatic
genome alterations in human lung cancer, to use this understanding to elucidate lung cancer pathogenesis, and
in turn to improve diagnosis and treatment. We have been honored to participate in many clinically impactful
genomic discoveries, including the discoveries of BRAF and EGFR mutations that guide targeted therapy use.
 In recent work, we continue to advance knowledge of lung cancer genomes and their function. We
described novel oncogenic mutations in lung cancer, the duplication of super-enhancer elements near
known oncogenes. We analyzed the cancer-causing activity of lung adenocarcinoma mutated genes such
as SOS1 and MGA; we initiated genomic approaches to immunological targets such as the ADAR RNA
deaminase gene; and we generated a genomically engineered model of aneuploidy for lung cancer.
 Our proposed research falls into three broad categories:
 1. Single gene alterations: we will analyze the mechanisms by which both mutations and copy number
alterations underlie the pathogenesis of lung adenocarcinoma. Examples described in this proposal include the
tumor suppressor gene CMTR2 and the lineage oncogene NKX2-1, which is the most significantly amplified
gene in lung adenocarcinoma.
 2. Immunological target identification: we will use genomic approaches to characterize immunological
features of lung cancer and potential vulnerabilities. Examples shown here include continued studies of genes
involved in RNA sensing & modification in the interferon pathway that are also cancer dependencies, as well as
large-scale functional genomic screens to identify epitopes that are antigenic targets of T cells in lung cancer.
 3. Genome-wide features. We continue to study aneuploidy and the function of gene dosage effects on
cell growth and proliferation. In addition, we are developing a new approach for genome-based therapy: nucleic
acid cleavage therapies that target the “neo-genome” in lung cancer DNA. This approach would exploit the novel
genomic sequences that result from chromosomal rearrangements in cancer by using genome engineering tools
to specifically target cancer cells.
 My goal is that the knowledge gained from the proposed research will deepen our understanding of
human lung adenocarcinoma and will drive novel and effective treatments for lung cancer patients."

Regular exercise and lifestyle physical activity (PA) are critical for quality of life and longevity among a growing
aging population. Aging produces changes to the structure and function of the heart, which increases
vulnerability to cardiovascular disease (e.g., coronary heart disease, heart failure, and stroke), frailty and falls,
dementia, and Alzheimer disease. Exercise helps to slow the progression of aging-associated changes to the
heart by promoting adaptations to the cardiovascular and pulmonary system, however exercise initiation and
maintenance can be difficult in aging adults due to deconditioning, pain, frailty, and disability. Exercise anxiety
is a novel mechanism related to non-adherence to exercise and lifestyle PA, that is characterized by cognitive,
behavioral, and physiological underpinnings. Exercise anxiety is particularly elevated in individuals with
cardiovascular disease given that the physical sensations of exercise often feel similar to the sensations
experienced or attributed to cardiovascular disease (e.g., shortness of breath, chest tightness, dizziness,
fatigue, pain). We developed a mechanistically-informed cognitive-behavioral intervention to target exercise
anxiety, called Behavioral Exposure For Interoceptive Tolerance (BE-FIT). In our Stage I pilot study, we
developed and demonstrated initial support for BE-FIT in low active patients with elevated exercise anxiety
enrolled in outpatient cardiac rehabilitation. The intervention was six sessions delivered as an adjunctive
treatment during the initial weeks of cardiac rehabilitation, and involved behavioral exposure to feared bodily
sensations and exercise situations, elimination of false safety behaviors and avoidance, and use of a wrist-
worn activity monitor for PA feedback and activity goal-setting. Our preliminary work established the feasibility,
acceptability and safety of BE-FIT. We also found evidence of target engagement (large-sized reductions in
exercise anxiety) and initial evidence for the effect of BE-FIT on exercise outcomes, including significant
increases in steps/day and moderate-vigorous PA minutes/day at the end of treatment. Given these very
promising data, we propose to take the next step by conducting a fully-powered Stage II randomized controlled
trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of BE-FIT, compared to a Health Education Control (HEC) intervention, for adults
(N=146) who are ≥40 years of age, cleared for outpatient CR, low active and have elevated exercise anxiety,
and to test whether changes in exercise anxiety are associated with subsequent changes in exercise outcomes
at EOT and follows-ups (Week 12, 18, and 24). We will evaluate intervention effects on exercise anxiety and its
components, including cognitive processes (catastrophizing, uncertainty, discomfort intolerance), behavior
(avoidance/safety behaviors), and physiological function (cardiac vagal control). This project will contribute
scientific and clinical understanding of anxiety and PA. If the efficacy of the BE-FIT can be established, this
intervention could serve as an adjunctive treatment to cardiac rehabilitation and be adapted for other patient
populations and treatment settings, for PA promotion in support of successful aging."
10915566,"While there have been numerous advances in computational methods aiding in rational drug design, most
approaches so far take a static view of the drug target, ignoring the complexities associated with the
dynamics and thermodynamics of conformational transitions. There is thus a pressing need for new
computational methods that are accurate, tractable and automatable for large scale drug discovery and
chemical biology studies that account for the changing nature of a generic drug target. Built on strong
theoretical and computational preliminary results, this program seeks to understand and guide design of
new inhibitors of tyrosine kinases and model riboswitches in a mechanistically guided paradigm.
Our research program is driven by the central hypotheses that (a) mechanistically aware ligand design
strategies can outperform traditional strategies guided only by structure, and (b) artificial intelligence (AI)-
integrated molecular dynamics (MD) simulation methods can help learn mechanisms in a high-throughput
fashion. Our program can be split into two overarching yet complementary thematic areas. In the first area,
we will develop sampling algorithms at the interface of statistical mechanics, MD simulations and AI to
probe mechanisms for rare event processes, such as drug unbinding and conformational change.
Specifically we will build on our preliminary work in using ideas from neural information processing and
natural language processing, and adapt them for advanced sampling methods that learn reaction coordinate,
thermodynamics and kinetics on-the-fly as the simulation progresses. In addition, we will also be interacting
closely with other leading computational groups to integrate our sampling methods with theirs and to
facilitate efficient, accurate sampling for polarizable force-field development. In the second area, we will
use our algorithms to guide mechanistically driven design of inhibitors of Src, Abl kinases and PreQ1
riboswitches. We will take a mechanistically driven perspective wherein we will map out the different
conformations of a given target and understand how an existing ligand interacts with these, and then propose
ligand modifications based upon this understanding. We will use our AI-augmented MD methods to
understand the dissociation mechanisms of ligands in one uninterrupted “atoms to mechanism” workflow
with minimal human intervention. All our predictions will be validated in different ways by our
experimental collaborators at Stony Brook University and the National Cancer Institute"

Over 1.3 million Americans develop shock annually and 30-50% do not survive depending on the underlying
cause of shock. Most research has focused on recognizing shock but has stopped short of identifying the
cause of shock. Differentiating between causes of shock such as infection, heart failure, bleeding, dehydration,
or lack of stress hormone, is extremely challenging. The complex presentation of a patient in shock and the
many different potential causes of shock requires many expert interprofessional clinicians, such as nurses,
pharmacists, emergency medicine, critical care, infectious disease and cardiology doctors, to weigh in. Yet,
there is no way for these clinicians to actively share their assessments, build a shared understanding of the
cause of shock, and reach a consensus on treatment. Poor communication among clinicians is a leading
source of harm in acute care hospitals, yet remains extremely understudied. This application’s long-term
objective is to improve the safety of critical care medicine by addressing poor interprofessional communication.
The Specific Aims of this application will be to: 1) understand why interprofessional clinicians disagree on the
cause of shock; 2) design a systematic process for interprofessional clinicians to share information, their
assessments and build a shared understanding of the cause of shock; and 3) put into clinical practice and
measure how this systematic process improves agreement among clinicians as well as timeliness and
accuracy of the identification of the cause of shock. The central hypothesis is that creating a process, informed
by the interprofessional clinicians who would use it, to bring together all experts in order to determine the
cause of shock quickly after a patient shows signs of shock, can improve agreement among clinicians,
timeliness and accuracy in identifying the cause of shock. We will apply a variety of methods to test this
hypothesis including machine learning, critical incident technique, user-centered design, implementation
science and interrupted time series analysis. Identifying modifiable healthcare system factors that lead to
disagreement among clinicians can inform the design of a systematic process to identify the cause of shock,
determine how to treat it and reduce the high risk of death."

Up to 93% of young adult female (YA-F) cancer survivors report fertility distress; 30-46% meet criteria for
moderate-severe fertility-related trauma. Gonadotoxic cancer treatments can cause infertility, early
menopause, or problems getting pregnant and carrying a pregnancy to term. Family building after cancer often
requires in vitro fertilization, surrogacy, or adoption, which have medical/physical, psychosocial, financial, legal,
and logistical barriers. Prior work shows that YA-Fs are unprepared for the challenges of family building after
cancer, have unrealistic expectations (such as overestimating the likelihood of success), and risk missing their
narrowed reproductive window and experiencing greater difficulty, distress, and higher costs than expected.
The long-term goal of the proposed research is to improve oncofertility care in post-treatment survivorship. We
propose to test the efficacy of the Roadmap to Parenthood software, an interactive web-based decision aid
and planning tool for family building after cancer for YA-F survivors (18-45 years old; assigned female at birth)
and explore its implementation potential. First, we will conduct a rigorous 12-month randomized controlled trial
(Aim 1). YA-F cancer survivors (N=256) will be randomized into the (a) Roadmap intervention condition or (b)
time and attention control condition that includes a web-based young adult cancer survivorship informational
booklet. Surveys will be administered at baseline (pre-intervention) and 1-, 6-, and 12-month follow up
timepoints. We hypothesize the intervention group compared to the control group will report lower decisional
conflict about family building (primary outcome), more planning behaviors aligned with family-building goals
(e.g., fertility testing, financial planning), and improved quality of life (secondary outcomes). Then, we will test
mediators and moderators of intervention efficacy (Aim 2). We hypothesize age, partnership status, fertility
preservation history, and engagement with the decision aid will moderate the relationship between the
intervention and decisional conflict, and increased levels of knowledge and self-efficacy and improved
communication with providers will mediate the intervention effect on decisional conflict. Finally, we will evaluate
future implementation potential of the Roadmap tool in clinical settings (Aim 3). Guided by the Capability-
Opportunity-Motivation Behavior (COM-B) implementation model, we will conduct qualitative interviews with
providers representing four specialties (N=32; 8 from each) to understand barriers and facilitators to the
implementation of the Roadmap tool across clinics. Providers working in diverse settings in oncology, primary
care, gynecology, and reproductive medicine, all of whom address reproductive health clinically, will be
included. Themes related to barriers/facilitators within the categories of ‘capability’ (e.g., skills, knowledge),
‘opportunity’ (e.g., resources), and ‘motivation’ (e.g., emotion, beliefs) will be identified. This research will
comprehensively respond to the identified needs of YA-F survivors that hope to have a child after cancer
through a novel intervention that provides information and support for decision making and early planning."

The objectives of my research program are to understand and engineer protein degradation by the
ubiquitin-proteasome system—a critical signaling mechanisms that all animals, plants, and fungi use
to perceive and adapt to their environment. The ubiquitin-proteasome system acts like the recycling
system of the cell, where specific proteins are marked for recycling by ubiquitin and are cut into
peptides by the proteasome to be further broken down and made into new proteins. The ability of the
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway to remodel a cell’s proteome in a rapid and specific way has perhaps
led to its ubiquity throughout the evolution of eukaryotes. The strong conservation of ubiquitin in
eukaryotes also makes it a prime candidate for engineering control systems in biology. The ubiquitin-
proteasome machinery in humans is frequently implicated in cancers, neurodegenerative diseases,
and metabolic disorders among other diseases, due to it is involvement in cell cycle regulation,
vascular development, and inflammation, among other critical processes. By improving our
understanding of how the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway functions or fails to function, we may
uncover new ways to treat or prevent human disease. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays
perhaps an even more central role in plants where it is involved in nearly all known plant hormone
signaling pathways to coordinate their growth and respond to changes in their environment, including
stresses such as pests and pathogens. These chemical hormones activate ubiquitin ligases which
trigger degradation of repressive transcription factors leading to activation of hormone-responsive
gene transcription. Interestingly, animals and microbes also perceive plant hormones which have
wide ranging effects on their physiology. Animals and microbes also produce plant hormones or
similar molecules to aberrantly activate ubiquitin-proteasome signaling and manipulate plants for their
benefit. Our research aims to understand the molecular mechanism of how information is transferred
through these ubiquitin-proteasome signaling pathways and how these hormone-signaling and
biosynthesis pathways have coevolved in plants and other eukaryotes. To do this we will use a deep
mutational scanning approach enabled by a massively parallel functional assays using a biosensor
we recently developed. In parallel, we aim to re-engineer these chemically activated ubiquitin ligases
to detect related and potentially novel chemical compounds and to act as rapid metabolic controllers.
These molecular tools will improve our ability to control and engineer biological systems and
sustainably biomanufacture these plant hormones and related chemicals, including important
agricultural and industrial chemicals, nutritional supplements, and pharmaceuticals."

perturbs mitonuclear interaction efficiency. Disrupted mitonuclear interaction results in mitochondrial
dysfunction, reduced organismal fitness, and initiation of various stress that has been associated with a
plethora of many human diseases, such as Huntington's disease, Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, and
type 2 diabetes mellitus. In response to disrupted mitonuclear interactions, cells activate stress response
pathways to remodel gene expression and metabolism, thereby maintaining mitochondrial function and
alleviating cellular stress. However, a detailed molecular understanding of mitonuclear mechanisms linking
activation of stress response pathways for maintaining mitochondrial function and stress resistance has been
understudied, representing a significant knowledge gap. I hypothesize that distinct mismatched mitonuclear
genomes maintain coordination of mitochondrial status with various stress response pathways to alleviate
harmful consequences of suboptimal mitonuclear interactions. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel
yeast mitonuclear exchange model (cytoductants) by combining more than 100 mtDNA genotypes onto the
same nDNA genetic background, thereby generating an elegant system with various degrees of perturbation in
mitonuclear interaction and altered mitochondrial function. Overall, the main goal of our research is to
mechanistically understand how perturbations in mitonuclear interaction are transduced into biological effects.
My laboratory will build and sustain three research projects to accomplish this goal. We will first test the
hypothesis that understanding mitonuclear communication at molecular level will uncover distinct mitonuclear
responses to perturbed mitonuclear interactions. (Project 1). Secondly, we will identify the crosstalk between
stress response pathways and their downstream effectors in protecting cells from various stress under the
condition of perturbed mitonuclear interaction. Further, we will determine whether a specific type of stressor
determines the specificity of the response or not (Project 2). Finally, with an innovative cell engineering
approach, we will investigate the hypothesis that balancing cellular energy hemostasis can mitigate the effect
of disrupted mitonuclear interaction (Project 3). The proposed research is significant because it will uncover
how cells respond to disrupted mitonuclear interactions to maintain cellular homeostasis. Since many
mitochondrial diseases are carried in heteroplasmy, this basic research into the maintenance of mitonuclear
interaction will likely identify modulators of efficient mitochondrial interaction. It might be targeted
pharmacologically to treat human pathologies associated with mitonuclear dysfunction, such as
neurodegeneration and aging."

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, leads to several debilitating
chronic conditions including kidney failure, retinopathy, neuropathy, and cardiovascular disease, and results in
a substantial burden to the United States healthcare system. In addition to those with T2D, approximately 90
million Americans have prediabetes, a condition that is associated with several similar health risks and greatly
increases the probability of developing T2D in the future. Given the significant clinical consequences and
associated economic impact, there is a major unmet medical need to design new strategies that slow or
prevent the progression of prediabetes to T2D. Currently, no medications are FDA-approved for the treatment
of prediabetes; thus, those with this disorder are mainly limited to behavioral lifestyle changes (e.g. increased
exercise, weight loss, and diet modification). Recent investigations, mostly conducted in T2D patients, show
that dietary supplementation with zinc confers favorable metabolic effects including reduction in fasting glucose
and hemoglobin A1c (HgbA1c). Indeed, zinc is known to be critical in the biosynthesis, processing, and
secretion of insulin in addition to improving insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues. Furthermore, recent
genomic studies have convincingly shown that variants in genes responsible for islet zinc transport (i.e.
SLC30A8) are amongst the strongest genetic determinants of T2D risk. Given these data, the primary
objectives of this application are to 1) assess the utility of zinc supplementation in individuals with prediabetes
to improve glycemic indices and insulin action and 2) better characterize the impact of genetic variation in
SLC30A8 on glucose control in response to zinc treatment. To accomplish these objectives, we will conduct a
prospective, double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 200 prediabetic subjects that evaluates the effect of zinc
supplementation (25 mg/day for 12 months) on HgbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, 2h oral glucose tolerance test
measures, and lipid levels at 0, 6, and 12 months. We will also perform a prospective genotype-directed
callback study based on SLC30A8 genotype to assess the effect of genetic variation in this gene on glycemic
control in relation to zinc supplementation. Measures of insulin action including processing (i.e.
proinsulin:insulin ratio), clearance (i.e. C-peptide:insulin ratio), and resistance (i.e. Matsuda Index) will be
evaluated pre- vs. post-zinc supplementation as well as by SLC30A8 genotype. Discovering new, scalable,
and inexpensive strategies that help improve glycemic control with little to no side effects in subjects with
prediabetes would ultimately help in reducing chronic complications associated with T2D and lower related
healthcare costs. In addition, we anticipate that the studies outlined in this application will set the stage for
more effective genotype-directed approaches in prediabetics and provide justification for future mechanistic
studies and larger clinical trials of SLC30A8 genotype-directed treatment and possibly prevention of T2D."

With age, dividing cells acquire DNA mutations. A small number of these somatic mutations confer a selective
advantage leading to a clonal proliferation of cells harboring the somatic mutation. In blood, this process is
termed ‘clonal hematopoiesis’. These mutations include both point mutations in cancer driver genes (eg. clonal
hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential ‘CHIP’) and megabase-scale deletions, duplications and copy-neutral
loss-of-heterozygosity (eg, mosaic chromosomal alterations, ‘mCAs’). CHIP and mCAs have each been
detected in ~5% of individuals over 60. While both predict shorter lifespans, CHIP leads to a myeloid biased
stem cell differentiation while mCAs lead to a lymphoid biased stem cell differentiation. As a result, CHIP and
mCAs have distinct disease associations with infection, cardiovascular disease, cancer and other diseases of
aging. Although CHIP has been an area of significant research activity, multiple gaps persist in our knowledge
of mCAs and their impacts on aging and population health. mCA clones that expand to make up a larger
proportion of the blood predict worse health consequences. However, we do not know why some mCA clones
but not others expand, what factors predict the rate of clonal expansion and how rate of expansion associates
with disease outcomes. Overall, we hypothesize that mCAs with higher rates of clonal expansion confer a
greater impact on health and that the propensity to expand has genetic and environmental underpinnings that
are mediated through gene expression. A barrier to addressing this gap is a paucity of large well-annotated
collections of longitudinally-sampled blood. Fortuitously, our team has two recent accomplishments that enable
us to address this gap: 1) a survey of mCAs in 67,000 whole genomes and 2) development of a novel
computational method to estimate the rate of mCA expansion from single timepoints. In Aim 1, we will
measure the rate of mCA expansion by leveraging unique serial blood samples (collected up to 19 years apart)
from 729 individuals with mCAs from three deeply phenotyped cohorts. In Aim 2, we will refine our method for
clonal expansion rate estimation and apply this method at population scale to estimate mCA clonal expansion
rates in 1.3 million individuals from several diverse cohorts. We will identify genetic and environmental factors
predisposing to clonal expansion and establish the relationship between mCA clonal expansion and disease. In
Aim 3, we will analyze bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing to ascertain the cell type specific biological impact
of mCAs and identify pathways leading to clonal expansion. Our multidisciplinary team with deep expertise in
computational genomics, statistics, hematology and human epidemiology is uniquely poised for success in this
effort. Successful execution of our aims will inform risk models to stratify individuals with mCAs for
personalized prevention, such as interventions or enhanced screening, and identify new biological pathways to
target for therapeutic development. Finally, our study serves as a model for insights on somatic mosaicism in
other tissues and disease sites beyond the blood to support healthy aging and improve population health."

Transition metal-catalyzed cross-coupling methods are important in the context of human health because they
play a central role in the synthesis of small-molecule therapeutics and molecular probes. Although cross-coupling
methodologies are dominated by palladium catalysis, newer methodologies utilizing terrestrially abundant 3d
metals (such as nickel) enable cross-coupling with polar C–O and C–N electrophiles. This feature is important
because O- and N-containing functional groups are common in bioderived and bioactive small molecules and
could therefore offer a greatly expanded scope of sustainably sourced cross-coupling partners. However, nickel
catalyzed methodologies for cross-coupling with acyl C–O and C–N electrophiles remain in early stages, and (i)
face practical limitations due to a pronounced sensitivity to changes in substrate structure, (ii) generally require
high precatalyst loadings, and (iii) often utilize high reaction temperatures or long reaction times. Attempts to
address these limitations are stymied by a lack of detailed mechanistic into the features responsible. This
proposal addresses these ambiguities through systematic mechanistic investigation of three distinct classes of
nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling with biologically important acyl C–O and C–N electrophiles with a specific focus
on (i) C–X activation steps, (ii) selectivity-determining features, and (iii) speciation of key organometallic
intermediates. This approach leverages ligand design and organometallic synthesis, structure elucidation
through spectroscopic and crystallographic studies, and reaction kinetics, supported by state-of-the-art
computational analysis to derive insights into the reactivity and selectivity-determining features of catalytic
reactions. These insights will be leveraged to elucidate key reactivity and selectivity relationships and to offer
methodological improvements that address current inefficiencies. As an Early-Stage Investigator (ESI), the PI is
uniquely suited to build this research program due to their extensive prior experience working across the organic–
inorganic and synthetic–mechanistic axes to interrogate, improve, and invent methodologies with translational
potential. The PI’s program will build on this expertise to offer conceptually innovative, mechanism-driven,
strategies to meet key synthetic needs. Successful completion of the proposed research will result in detailed
insight into the mechanisms and limiting features of nickel-catalyzed acyl C–N and C–O activation and cross
coupling. These insights will be translated into development of a suite of single-component precatalysts with
enhanced activity and selectivity along with a practical “user’s guide to catalyst selection” to enable expanded
application to the synthesis and elaboration of biologically important small molecules. The ultimate goal of this
project area is to achieve mechanism-driven improvements bringing these methodologies—which use
terrestrially abundant metals to elaborate biologically abundant functional groups—to a level competitive with or
superior to established, palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling alternatives."

Social interactions are essential for animal health. Prolonged isolation from social environments profoundly
affects animal behavior, physiology, and wellness, expressed during the COVID-19 pandemic as increased
levels of sleep disruption and eating disorders, among other population-wide behavioral problems. The
underlying mechanisms through which chronic social isolation is processed and impacts health-critical
behavior are unknown. A brief disconnection from the social environment is not detrimental. Social isolation, by
its very nature, is a continuous and prolonged process, yet how animal brain constructs an evolving state
recording this process remains an outstanding problem in understanding social isolation biologically. To
address this challenge, I established a Drosophila melanogaster model and discovered the molecular
differences between physiological states associated with acute and chronic social isolation. This novel
approach has enabled the dissection of underlying mechanisms by using “isolation timing” as a parameter,
thereby allowing the identification of cells that signal the chronic status of social isolation for the first time in any
model system. My previous research has shown that manipulating the identified cells alters the perception of
social isolation duration and social isolation-induced behavioral outcomes, including sleep loss and
hyperphagia. In this proposal, we plan to carry out three complimentary projects that capitalize on our recent
results to further uncover the timekeeping mechanism modulating physiological effects during chronic social
isolation. First, we will elucidate the genetic and molecular pathways that contribute to timekeeping and
mediate health-critical behavioral alterations induced by chronic social isolation, with a special focus on the
cross talk with the circadian clock. Second, we will identify the molecular substrates underlying “isolation
timing” during chronic social isolation and interrogate how an “isolation timer” signals the sleep/wake regulatory
network. Third, we will investigate how chronic social isolation drives insatiable hunger and impacts
metabolism. To achieve these goals, we will employ a multidisciplinary approach including neurogenetics, high
throughput and high-resolution behavioral measurements, transcriptome profiling, functional imaging, and
metabolomic analysis. The proposed study, using an innovative framework to investigate the mechanisms by
which chronic social isolation is processed on long-time scales and impacts health-critical behaviors at the
molecular and cellular levels, will ultimately lead to a deeper understanding of the biology of social isolation
and potential interventions/treatments to alleviate the suffering and diseases caused by chronic social isolation."

The PI’s goal is to develop an interdisciplinary research program and a foundational algorithmic
framework for reliably inferring health states from physiological signals acquired using wearable
and portable physiological monitoring devices. Uncovering the health states will unleash an array
of applications related to monitoring inflammation, metabolism, fatigue and interoceptive
awareness. For instance, it is well known that hormones play an important role in maintaining
homeostasis of the body, while cytokines are crucial as mediators of immune response after
surgery or infection that disturbs this homeostasis. Adverse external influences such as stress
can profoundly alter the hormone or cytokine production in patients, affecting their health and
complicating recovery from diseases or surgery. The knowledge of their secretion and modulation
in response to major influences such as cardiac surgery, medications, disease, and stress is
crucial to the health of patients, more so when more than one of these factors is concurrently
present. Thus, there is a compelling but unfulfilled need to quantify hidden health states of
inflammation, metabolism, fatigue and interoceptive awareness. The PI’s laboratory seeks to
pioneer system-theoretic computational toolsets for understanding the pulsatile signaling
underlying the physiological signals (e.g., cytokines, hormones, eye movement) related to
different health states and capturing the unobserved temporal dynamics of one’s health states in
a biologically plausible manner while considering extensive experimental settings and clinical
data. This project will determine the pulsatile physiological signaling from discrete, noisy
measurements by performing signal deconvolution to extract the neuronal stimuli underlying their
modulation, and will build decoders to quantify internal health states that are indicative of
inflammation, metabolism, fatigue and interoceptive awareness using both unlabeled information
as well as labels via feedback from patients and clinicians, to help physicians interpret
physiological data and inform patient-specific treatment in a holistic manner. The proposed
research will use de-identified data both from publicly available datasets and those collected by
the PI’s collaborators (e.g., endocrinology, rheumatology, neurosurgery, psychiatry,
neuroscience) using wearable or portable devices to perform signal analysis and compare the
results against previously published results, known experimental settings, and clinical knowledge
to validate the models and provide new insight."

Histone chaperones are functionally and structurally diverse proteins. They play a central role in chromatin
organization and maintenance by binding to histones and facilitating nucleosome assembly during DNA
replication, transcription, recombination and repair processes. Moreover, some histone chaperones evolved
additional functions independent of histone binding. Histone chaperones are thus essential for cellular
proliferation and organismal development. Intriguingly, circumventing this lethality in a number of cell fate
change paradigms revealed roles of histone chaperones in cellular plasticity. For example, we and others have
shown that the chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1), a histone chaperone complex involved in replication
dependent nucleosome assembly and heterochromatin regulation, prevents cellular reprogramming. More
recently, we demonstrated that CAF-1 maintains lineage integrity of stem and progenitor cells by repressing
the transcription of differentiation genes. In this context, CAF-1 controls chromatin accessibility at
enhancer/promoter elements of lineage specific loci and prevents aberrant binding of transcription factors. In
addition to these CAF-1 sensitive sites, we also identified heterochromatic loci whose accessibility is perturbed
upon CAF-1 loss, albeit with unknown effects on cell fate. The influence of CAF-1 on local euchromatic and
heterochromatic loci is intriguing given that CAF-1 acts in a sequence independent manner to assemble
nucleosomes during DNA replication. Whether such profound effects of CAF-1 on cell fate are linked to its
nucleosome assembly function or additional non-canonical functions remain unexplored. Moreover, given the
growing repertoire of histone chaperones and associated histone variants, it remains unclear whether CAF-1
cooperates with other histone chaperones to maintain lineage integrity. Therefore, the functional and structural
determinants of the histone chaperone network as a whole in the context of cell fate remain important open
questions. To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the lineage specifying functions of histone
chaperones, we will use well established cell fate change paradigms in combination with gene editing/RNAi,
multi-omics, biochemical and functional approaches. Specifically, we propose the following two research
directions: (1) Investigate the regulatory mechanisms and function of histone chaperone sensitive chromatin
sites and, (2) interrogate the structure-function relationships of histone chaperones and how their domains are
intimately linked to control cell fate. In the short-term, we plan to dissect the epigenome and structural
determinants of CAF-1. In the long-term we plan to extend our analysis to other histone chaperones pathways
and how they cooperate with CAF-1 to control cell fate. If successful, our studies will contribute to design
strategies for manipulating histone chaperone pathways to control cell fate in health and disease."
10877077,"This T32 Program, titled “Integrated, Multidisciplinary Training In Cardiovascular Research”, is in its 45th
year and is dedicated to the training of cardiovascular scientists with MD and/or PhD degrees. Previously
focused on training in cellular and molecular biology, during the last 5-year renewal we expanded its scope
to include translational and clinical research while strengthening its roots in rigorous fundamental research
and adding new areas of investigation including multi-dimensional ‘omics, molecular imaging, computational
biology, machine learning and artificial intelligence. During the next cycle of this award we will continue to
train the next generation of scientists in scientific inquiry across a broad range of disciplines that enable
transformative discovery in cardiovascular science. The graduates of the Program have been highly
successful in multiple ways, which include publishing in high-profile journals, obtaining extramural funding,
and securing outstanding independent faculty positions. The vast majority of past trainees (88%) continue to
focus on research with academic appointments as faculty or via research and leadership positions in
industry. 47% have been awarded career development grants (K-award or equivalent). We anticipate that
this trend will continue as the current fellows complete their training and submit career development awards.
New faculty were recruited to the award to enable trainees to benefit from dramatic recent advances in
cardiovascular science. The 28 faculty members on the award are recognized leaders, rigorous and ethical
scientists, as well as proven and outstanding mentors. Training is firmly centered on an intensive research
experience under the supervision of skilled primary and secondary mentors, with unique opportunities for
innovation at the interface between fields. In recognition of the increasingly complex scientific landscape our
trainees must navigate, we have substantially strengthened the didactic curriculum of the program, which
now includes new mandatory lectures in scientific methods, biostatistics, rigor and reproducibility, machine
learning and data science. Support is provided for 3 trainees at any given time to obtain masters degrees in
public health, bioinformatics or other fields, and all trainees receive mandatory training in the responsible
conduct of research. The faculty and trainees are closely linked by a tradition of collaboration and a shared
training mission. In addition to a dedicated T32 lecture curriculum, the CVRC/T32 seminar series, cardiology
grand rounds, CVRC retreat, journal club and “Science Social” meetings bring trainees and faculty together
on a regular basis. Trainee progress is closely monitored by the mentors and co-mentors, as well as the
Program Directors. The Program Directors provide regular updates to an External Advisory Committee, and
a concerted effort is made to recruit and retain underrepresented minority candidates. As demonstrated by
the strong track record of this Training Program, graduates are rigorously and systematically prepared to
lead independent research programs at the cutting edge of cardiovascular science."

Contemporary new technologies such as optogenetics and single cell genomics show that electrically active
neurons stimulate growth of adult and pediatric gliomas. Conversely, cancers and cancer therapies alter
nervous system form and function (e.g., cancer therapy-related cognitive impairment colloquially known as
‘‘chemobrain’’ or ‘‘chemofog”). The two-way dialogue between tumors and the nervous system defines an
emerging new scientific discipline termed “Cancer Neuroscience”. The Department of Neurology at Brigham
and Women’s Hospital (BWH), together with the Department of Neurobiology at Harvard Medical School
(HMS), propose an integrative, first-in-kind postdoctoral training program in this new field. The Program will be
co-led by a clinician scientist, Tracy Batchelor, M.D. (Chair of Neurology at BWH) and a basic scientist Michael
Greenberg, Ph.D. (co-director, Harvard Brain Science Initiative). A faculty of 29 mentors will be drawn from the
Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center and from the Harvard Brain Science Initiative. This will be a basic science
program. Candidates with Ph.D. and/or M.D. degrees will be eligible but there will be no clinical training.
 We request support for 6 postdoctoral fellows per year to serve 2-year appointments. The Program will
foster both scientific development and professional development of these trainees. For Scientific
Development, the Program will bring doctorate level basic scientists with skill sets in neural development,
electrophysiology, neural circuitry, optogenetics, brain metabolism and neurochemistry into the laboratories of
clinical/translational investigators working on primary and also metastatic cancers of the brain. For laboratory
research, fellows will be taught to identify important questions and approaches that will move the field forward
and provide translational opportunities to impact cancer treatment. For professional development, we will
provide trainees with (i) opportunities to refine and enhance their grantsmanship and scientific communication
skills; (ii) individual Development Plans; (iii) individual postdoctoral mentoring committees, and (iv) customized
opportunities for trainees to acquire experience in mentoring and teaching depending on their career goals.
 The program Director and co-Director will work closely with a Training Oversight Committee and an
External Advisory Board. Collaborative relationships with Morehouse School of Medicine and with the
University of Massachusetts-Boston (the largest center of higher education for minority students in New
England) will help identify ways to recruit underrepresented minorities into the program and to maintain a
welcoming environment for these trainees. Additional strategies to measure trainee satisfaction, quantify
outcomes, and evaluate the effectiveness of the program will include annual surveys from trainees and
mentors, as well as exit and alumni interviews. Institutional support in the form of state-of-art core facilities,
technology platforms and funds to support T32-specific training activities and yearly EAB meetings will
significantly enhance the training program."

Lipids provide a rich source of energy to fuel fundamental cellular processes including migration,
differentiation, and survival through periods of low nutrient availability. The storage and utilization
of lipid fuel relies on lipid droplets (LD). These unique organelles are surrounded by peripheral
phospholipid monolayer that encapsulate a core containing neutral lipids triacylglycerol (TAG)
and cholesterol ester (CE). LDs possess a unique proteome of adapters, enzymes, and structural
proteins that interact directly with the LD monolayer and regulate trafficking for biogenesis and
catabolism. However, detailed mechanistic knowledge regarding the relationship between the LD
monolayer and LD trafficking machinery is lacking. This knowledge is especially critical for the
process of lipophagy, whereby subpopulations of LDs are selectively targeted for lysosomal
degradation. Our preliminary data suggest that LDs possess heterogenous lipid signatures at the
level of the LD monolayer, and this heterogeneity influences the fate of certain small LD
subpopulations toward lipophagy. Furthermore, we postulate that lipids of the LD monolayer
including diacylglycerol (DAG) and phosphatidtyliositol (PI) are modulated by LD catabolic
enzymes to influence their trafficking. In Project 1, we will determine the role of adipose
triglyceride lipase (ATGL) in generating DAG on the LD surface via TAG hydrolysis, and explore
the impact of DAG on the recruitment and activation of protein kinase C (PKC) on the LD surface.
In Project 2, we will investigate Rab5 in recruiting PI 3-Kinases to the LD surface to phosphorylate
PI, define the role of ESCRT proteins in the trafficking of LDs for lipophagy in mammalian cells.
We will also explore an unexpected role for certain ESCRTs in LD biogenesis. The results gained
from the proposed research will provide a mechanistic understanding of lipid droplet trafficking
and the modulation of the LD monolayer."

Quorum sensing (QS) is a cell-cell communication system used by many bacteria to regulate gene
expression in a coordinated manner. Our work focuses on the QS system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
a saprophyte and opportunistic pathogen of humans. P. aeruginosa uses QS to regulate dozens of
genes, including several important virulence factors. P. aeruginosa QS is mediated by the transcription
factors LasR and RhlR, which respond to acyl-homoserine lactone signals, and PqsR, which responds to
alkylquniolone signals. Initial characterizations of QS in P. aeruginosa described a hierarchy: LasR
regulates RhlR and PqsR activity. Over the past several years we, and others, have shown that this
hierarchy is malleable. RhlR and PqsR can be active in the absence of functional LasR in isolates from
many settings, particularly those isolated from the chronic lung infections of people with cystic fibrosis
(CF). These results suggest a “rewiring” of QS that is critical to the maintenance of virulence functions in
chronic infections.
This proposal builds on our previous observations to ask about the biological significance of this alternate
hierarchy in bacterial isolates from people with CF. We make use of CF isolates and a laboratory model
strain to ask i) how is the architecture of QS of P. aeruginosa altered?; ii) in this altered hierarchy, how
do RhlR and PqsR QS interact to effect virulence functions in isolates from chronic infection?; and iii)
what is the role of a highly-conserved, uniformly QS regulated, non-ribosomal peptide synthetase?
The answers to these questions will define the central importance of RhlR and PqsR in P. aeruginosa from
chronic infections and inform future efforts to design therapeutics targeting RhlR or PQS QS in this
bacterium."

The broad objectives of this K08 proposal are two-fold: 1) to facilitate development of the necessary skills that
will allow the candidate to achieve her long-term goal of becoming a successful physician-scientist focusing on
determinants of recovery from viral pneumonia in aged hosts, and 2) to investigate the mechanisms that direct
the Tregs to orchestrate resolution of severe lung injury throughout the lifespan. The candidate and her mentors
have designed a detailed training plan tailored to the candidate's specific needs and goals. The plan includes a
rigorous research component that will afford the PI new knowledge and research skills to better examine the
links between a critical immune cell population and the endothelium during recovery from viral pneumonia. The
proposal concerns viral pneumonia, specifically influenza-induced lung injury, its clinical counterpart the acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and how they both disproportionately affect the elderly population. Despite
decades of dedicated research, there are only a few anti-viral therapies with limited efficacy to manage severe
viral pneumonia. Tregs have been shown to decrease inflammation and promote tissue repair in diverse murine
models of lung injury. Tregs also increase in the lungs of patients with ARDS, suggesting that they may play a
role in the human adaptive immune response to lung injury. However, the specific mechanisms that cause Tregs
to execute their pro-repair program following lung injury remain unknown. Our preliminary data shows that the
youthful reparative Treg cell program following influenza-induced lung injury is dominated by biologic processes
linked to the development and repair of blood capillaries. This reparative program is lost in aged hosts in a cell-
autonomous manner. Thus, we hypothesize that aging results in Treg cell-specific downregulation of important
pro-angiogenic factors expression such as VEGFA, leading to impaired alveolar endothelial repair and recovery
from viral pneumonia. The long-term goal of the proposal is to identify novel small molecule- and cell-based
therapeutics to control inflammation and promote tissue repair in our increasingly older population. To test this
hypothesis, we propose the following Specific Aims: 1) determine whether age-related alterations in the pro-
endothelial repair function of Tregs results from cell-autonomous or microenvironmentally-driven changes, 2)
determine whether Treg cell-generated VEFGA is necessary and sufficient to restore the pro-endothelial repair
function present in youth that is lost with aging, and 3) determine whether age-related VEGFA expression in
alveolar Tregs in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is associated with 30-day mortality in patients with severe viral
pneumonia. We will use standard techniques to assess severity of lung injury, endothelial repair, heterochronic
(age mis-matched) adoptive Treg cell transfer, multiple transgenic murine strains for loss-of-function and gain-
of-function experiments, flow cytometry, fluorescence-activated cell sorting and transcriptional profiling with
RNA-sequencing as the primary methods to support the experimental design of this proposal."
10908399,"Cell to cell signaling is fundamental to all multicellular life. Secreted signaling molecules from one cell are
able to communicate with other cells through interaction with receptors on the surface, which interpret and
transduce these signals. One such class of secreted signaling molecules is encoded by the Wnt gene family.
These protein products drive a plethora of cellular processes, including cellular symmetry, proliferation, tissue
polarity and stem cell maintenance. This variety of processes occurs using conserved intracellular machinery to
program these outputs, indicating a need for complex control at the level of the cell membrane. At least part of
the regulation of this signaling complexity lies in the multiple genes encoding specific ligands (19 in mammals)
and receptors (10 in mammals). However, the specific mechanisms that start with the association of
various ligands and receptors at the membrane, and lead to nuclear transcriptional activity are
incompletely understood. One of the missing links in this aspect is to decipher how the receptor complex is
internalized by the cell, where it is trafficked to, and how these events lead to diverse transcriptional outputs.
This system of ligand-receptor inputs leading to diverse outputs is likely dependent on the composition of the
receptor complex, and the cellular context of the signal. Deciphering this code will be crucial to our understanding
of how cells receive and transduce specific signals. This proposal aims to characterize the communication
between trafficking of a specific Wnt signaling receptor complex, and activation of transcription in the nucleus.
 Although it is known that pairing a Wnt ligand and Frizzled (Fzd) receptor is required for the transduction of
many (if not most) Wnt signals, our understanding of the mechanisms through which specific Wnt/Fzd pairings
allow the transcriptional activator β-catenin (β-cat) to enter the nucleus is lacking. We have developed a novel
system to study specific signal transduction of this nature by fluorescently labeled the Wnt ligand, Fzd receptor,
and the transcriptional activator β-cat. This is based on our previous studies which have indicated that there is
an exquisitely specific pairing of the ligand Wnt9a with the receptor Frizzled (Fzd)9b, and that specificity
of this signal is conferred by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). This proposal aims to further
define the mechanism of Wnt9a/Fzd9b signal transduction by studying the intracellular trafficking of this receptor
complex, and coupling this to β-cat movements. By first understanding how one specific Wnt/Fzd pairing
establishes a specific signal, we can generate a model for further testing other Wnt/Fzd complexes in different
cellular contexts. Furthermore, cell signaling events often cross-over to other pathways; these findings could
certainly impact our understanding of how other receptor-ligand complexes lead to diverse outputs in cells.
 The PI has expertise in Wnt signaling and cell biology, as well as experience with mentoring students to
publications in these areas. Successful completion of these projects set the PI and her lab up to be leaders in
the field of Wnt signaling, and for long-term success in the field."

We work on molecular mechanisms of nucleotide excision repair and the mammalian circadian clock. We have
recently made both the technological and mechanistic progress in both of these areas and obtained direct
evidence of inter-connectedness of these two fields. Our findings in both fields are directly applicable to human
health. We will apply these new advances for the following objectives:
 (1) We have developed higher resolution versions of our original XR-seq method for genome-wide single-
nucleotide resolution mapping of repair of all DNA damage that is processed by nucleotide excision repair,
including damage induced by carcinogens and chemotherapeutic drugs. In addition, we developed Damage-seq
methods for similarly genome-wide single nucleotide resolution mapping of DNA damage. We have used the
combination of the two methods to discover repair hotspots and coldspots that do not overlap damage hotspots
or coldspots and have gained novel information on genome 3D and repair. We will continue characterizing these
features to link repair to epigenomic markers, 3D genome organization, chromatin states, and replication timing.
XR-seq has also enabled us to discover a novel transcription-coupled repair mechanism in Drosophila and other
insects in the order Diptera. We will use biochemical and genetic approaches to solve the mechanism of this
novel repair system.
 (2) We will define the molecular mechanism of the mammalian circadian clock. Recently, we demonstrated
that Cryptochrome (CRY), and not Period (PER), is the repressor in the mammalian transcription-translation
feedback loop (TTFL), and that PER acts either as a repressor or an activator, depending on the particular gene,
in a CRY-dependent manner. We will carry out experiments to reconstitute this model in an in vitro system with
purified proteins.
 (3) Circadian clock, cancer, and chemotherapy. For the first time, we have been able to map both damage
formation by cisplatin and its repair in mouse tissues including liver, kidney, and lung, genome-wide and at single-
nucleotide resolution. We made the exciting discovery that for most genes the transcribed strand (TS) and non-
transcribed strand (NTS) are repaired at different times of the day. We plan to take advantage of this finding to
develop more efficient chronotherapy regimens, first for colorectal cancers, and in the future for other types of
cancers that are treated with cisplatin and oxaliplatin. The proposed research is innovative because it is based
on our discoveries in the fields of DNA repair and circadian clock, and it is significant because of its relevance
for cancer prevention and treatment."

Stress is a key barrier to asthma medication adherence and asthma control. The Lazarus Folkman's Model of
Stress states that a person experiences stress when a stimulus, appraised as exceeding their resources,
endangers their well-being. In my preliminary focus groups, Black adults with asthma reported that increased
psychosocial stress (e.g., perceived discrimination, job stress, caregiver burden), health-related stress (e.g.,
difficulty self-managing asthma), and economic stress (e.g., economic strain) were barriers to asthma
medication adherence and control. However, interventions simultaneously targeting these stressors are not
commonly evaluated in Black adults with asthma. To fill this evidence gap, I will identify types of minor stress,
chronic stress, and coping strategies associated with increased asthma severity in a NHLBI-funded cohort (i.e.,
Jackson Heart Study) of Black adults (Aim 1). I will then use these findings to develop and culturally tailor a
novel stress management intervention, called CALM (Coping with Asthma through Life Management) (Aim 2),
and pilot its implementation in a health system (Aim 3). CALM will be an innovative, culturally-adapted, stress
management intervention designed to promote adaptive coping by targeting 3 common sources of stress in
Black adults with asthma—psychosocial issues, poor asthma self-management, and economic strain—with the
aim of managing the effects of stress and ultimately improving asthma medication adherence and asthma
control. My central hypothesis is that CALM, targeting multiple sources of stress specifically faced by Black
adults with asthma, will be feasibly implemented in a health system, will be acceptable to program participants,
and will provide a potentially effective intervention to increase asthma medication nonadherence and asthma
control. The proposed research will be conducted under the mentorship of Dr. L. Ebony Boulware, MD, MPH
(primary mentor, health disparities, qualitative methods), Dr. Loretta G. Que, MD (co-primary mentor, asthma
research), Dr. Laura Porter, PhD (co-mentor, clinical psychology, health behavior), Dr. Christopher E. Cox,
MD, MPH (collaborator, coping skills training), and Dr. Maren Olsen, PhD (collaborator, biostatistics). By
accomplishing the research aims, I will yield a finalized CALM intervention that will be ready for a randomized
controlled trial and will serve as foundation for an independent research career in asthma health disparities."

 Cell reprogramming represents a major advancement in biology, and has wide applications in
regenerative medicine, disease modeling and drug screening. During cell reprogramming, cells experience
epigenetic changes that result in a cell phenotype switch. However, whether and how biophysical factors
regulate cell reprogramming through epigenetic modifications are not well understood. We have found that
biophysical factors, specifically extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness, has profound effects on epigenetic
state and the conversion of fibroblasts into induced neuronal (iN) cells, with the highest efficiency at an
intermediate ECM stiffness, which is regulated by focal adhesions and the cytoskeleton. In addition, we
have discovered that actin assembly and transport into nucleus plays an important role in epigenetic
modulation. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that (1) biophysical cues such as ECM
stiffness regulates FAs, actin assembly/disassembly, nuclear transport of actin, and thus, HAT activity to
modulate the epigenetic state and cell reprogramming process and (2) an intermediate level of stiffness is
optimal for epigenetic remodeling and cell reprogramming. To test our hypothesis, we propose three
Specific Aims: (1) Investigate how matrix stiffness regulates iN reprogramming through FAs and actin
cytoskeleton, (2) Elucidate how matrix stiffness modulates HAT and the epigenetic state to turn on neuronal
genes during iN reprogramming, and (3) Determine the role of actin nuclear transport in matrix stiffness-
modulation of HAT and epigenetic state during iN reprogramming. We have assembled a multidisciplinary
team with expertise on mechanobiology, cell engineering, high throughput genomic and epigenomic
analysis, and live cell imaging to work together and investigate the underlying biophysical and biological
mechanisms. Our proposed studies will be one of the first to elucidate how ECM stiffness regulates
transcriptomic and epigenetic changes for cell reprogramming, and how ECM stiffness modulates focal
adhesions and the cytoskeleton for cell reprogramming. Findings from this project will unravel new
mechanisms of cell fate determination, which will have wide applications in cell and tissue engineering,
disease modeling and drug discovery, and provide a rational basis for the optimization and development of
novel biomaterials for somatic cell reprogramming."
10890077,"Sepsis is a significant public health issue in the United States, killing 300,000 people each year and generating
over $60 billion in costs to Medicare beneficiaries. Because we do not fully understand how infection triggers
the inflammatory dysregulation seen in sepsis, no targeted therapies for sepsis are clinically available. Patient
treatments are limited to antibiotics directed against infection and supportive care for organ failure. Cell death
signaling pathways, the mechanisms that control cell fate in response to environmental stimuli, are distributed
throughout mammalian tissue and are a foundational component of host defense against invading pathogens.
During infection, these pathways activate immune responses, clear infected cells, incite tissue damage, and
promote inflammation. This proposal seeks to understand how cell death signaling pathways contribute to the
inflammatory dysregulation that typifies sepsis. This will be done by assaying activity of these pathways under
conditions of infection in both immune and non-immune tissue. Samples collected from septic human patients
will be analyzed for cell death signaling pathway activity and data will be correlated with clinical variables.
Insights gained from these observations will be used to direct mechanistic studies aimed at determining how
these pathways are regulated during sepsis. Both in vitro and in vivo techniques will be utilized when
experiments cannot be performed in human patients. Cultured human cell lines will be infected and analyzed in
vitro, and the effects of cell death signaling pathway inhibition will be measured in septic animals. Results from
this proposal will better define the mechanisms through which infection unleashes dysregulated inflammation in
sepsis and offer a greater understanding of how core cellular homeostasis and defense machinery functions
during critical illness. This knowledge stands to produce novel therapeutic strategies and targets for a deadly
disease process that continues to put tremendous strain on modern healthcare systems."
10932175,"Abstract
The primary route of internalization from the plasma membrane is clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), which
is required for vital cellular processes such as signaling, nutrient uptake, and development. While the molecular
mechanisms underlying the late stages of vesicle formation are well studied, the mechanisms underpinning the
earliest stages of endocytosis, including initiation and cargo selection, are poorly understood. Initiation and cargo
binding are largely controlled by the AP2 clathrin adaptor complex, a core component of the vesicle coat that
serves as a bridge between the rigid clathrin lattice and membrane-embedded cargo. However, it is unclear how
AP2 discriminates between hundreds of potential cargo in a complex membrane environment, while also
responding to spatial and temporal regulatory cues. While >50 proteins are proposed to regulate or be required
for CME, and many physically interact with AP2, we have little mechanistic and structural data for how they are
regulated during the earliest stages of endocytosis. We propose that multiple unique AP2 conformations, driven
by association with regulatory factors, control higher-order AP2 functions such as cargo selection. Understanding
the nature of the regulatory mechanisms controlling endocytosis is critical, as CME largely controls the
localization of many medically-relevant proteins such as RTKs and GPCRs. This proposal therefore seeks to
reconstitute and define the molecular mechanisms of AP2-mediated endocytic initiation and cargo sorting.
Current models of endocytosis largely rely on biochemical experiments performed with soluble components and
live cell imaging. Importantly, our methodology is focused on modifying all experimental approaches — cryo-EM,
biochemical reconstitution, and single molecule fluorescence microscopy — to include a membrane, thereby
addressing a critical need to develop mechanistic models in a near-native membrane environment. This
approach is poised to provide an understanding of the role of membrane-induced allostery in driving regulatory
decision-making during endocytic initiation. This proposal will focus on two broad areas of endocytic regulation
— cargo selection mediated by the conserved Muniscin family proteins, and a quality control checkpoint
controlled by a single phosphorylation mark on the μ2 subunit of AP2. As diseases associated with endocytic
defects are likely caused by missorting of important trans-membrane cargo, our insights into the mechanisms of
endocytic initiation and cargo selection will enable hypothesis-driven research into disease model systems and
drug development."

Abstract: Assessing if tumor induced muscle cachexia is initiated by defects in Myosin
Heavy Chain production and localization in a Drosophila tumor model
Cachexia is a devastating cancer associated disease which affects millions each year
and yet is untreatable. Currently cachexia is defined in patients by rapid loss of >5% of
body weight with muscle weakness and an underlying chronic condition. Cachexia is
considered a late stage consequence of cancer. Here, we present preliminary data
acquired by undergraduate students using a Drosophila model of cancer cachexia.
Excitingly, we have identified stereotyped changes which occur in vivo early in tumor
development. In this study we will distinguish the origins of these phenotypes, assess
their contribution to cachexia progression, and investigate if the Hippo signaling
pathway is regulating early or late events in cachexia.We will leverage our expertise in
staining and imaging as well as new community tools which allow tissue specific genetic
manipulation to achieve our goals. These works, conducted by underrepresented
undergraduate researchers and master’s students will shed light on the unknown
etiology of cancer induced cachexia. Results of these, and future translational works,
are the foundation to developing earlier diagnostics permitting interventions to prevent
cachexic progression in patients. Through the course of this support the PI will establish
an independent research program which will illuminate the earliest steps of cachexic
changes in muscles and provide critical training and support to underrepresented
trainees."
10894741,"SUMMARY
Across the biomedical sciences there has been an increased recognition that many key questions
in these fields require phylogenetic thinking and approaches. My group has a very strong track
record of making fundamental methodological contributions that have changed how biologists
think about and analyze phylogenetically structured data and of finding new applications for
these methods. My group’s current research is focused on two main themes, both related to the
evolution of genomic function.
 First, we will use phylogenetic comparative approaches to investigate the dynamics of
gene expression evolution across species. We will first assess the appropriateness of adopting
phylogenetic models of phenotypic evolution for describing changes in gene expression using an
approach we have previously developed. This will enable us to assess the robustness of findings
regarding the relative importance of different evolutionary processes in generating interspecific
diversity and help us develop the next-generation of models, specifically tailored to functional
genomic data. We will then build a mechanistic model that will allow us and other researchers to
test for associations between gene expression evolution and sequence evolution in the promoter
regions.
 Second, we will study the evolution of Immunoglobulin genes, which encode the unique
antigen recognition sequences of B cells, which produce antibodies. We will investigate this at
two nested levels: the evolution of the B cell repertoire over time and in response to pathogens
and the evolution of the germline Immunoglobulin genes. To examine changes in the B cell
repertoire, we will adopt approaches that our research group has pioneered in the context of
macroevolution, to characterize the dynamics of the system. We are specifically interested in
estimating the rate of somatic mutation and the number of distinct clonal lineages that are
expanding in response to an infectious disease. There is accumulating evidence that variation in
the evolved response of B cells is associated with inter-individual variation in the germline
Immunoglobulin genes. However, the underpinning mechanism remains unclear as do the
reasons there appears to be so much diversity at these loci across individuals. We will derive an
evolutionary model, and parameterize it using comparative genomic data, to evaluate the
plausibility of alternative hypotheses for explaining both of these observations."
10848438,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A growing body of evidence indicates that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), a diverse class of non-protein-
coding transcripts >200 nucleotides in length, play important roles in the initiation and progression of cancer.
LncRNAs have been proposed to regulate all cancer hallmarks, but, in the vast majority of cases, their
molecular mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. This knowledge gap is a major impediment
towards realizing the potential of lncRNAs as therapeutic targets in cancer and other diseases. As in many
human malignancies, lncRNAs are frequently dysregulated in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). RCC is the most
common type of kidney cancer and the most lethal malignant urological tumor, with approximately 70,000 new
cases diagnosed annually in the United States. To date, most genomic studies of RCC (and other cancers)
have focused on identifying disease-associated alterations of protein-coding genes. Our understanding of the
molecular pathways regulated by lncRNAs in RCC, and the functional roles of these transcripts in this
malignancy, remains limited. We mined RNA-seq data from RCC patients to identify a set of 805 lncRNAs that
are commonly overexpressed in this tumor type. We generated a custom CRISPR interference (CRISPRi)
library targeting these lncRNAs and performed screens in multiple RCC cell lines to identify lncRNAs that are
essential for RCC cell proliferation. These experiments revealed that the lncRNA Colorectal neoplasia
differentially expressed (CRNDE) is required for growth of all tested RCC cell lines. Although this lncRNA has
been shown to be overexpressed and is associated with poor patient survival in RCC and other types of
cancer, its molecular function remains unclear. We identified a critical region of CRNDE that is necessary for
RCC cell proliferation and we identified proteins that interact with this sequence. We also generated novel
genetically-engineered alleles in mice that enable constitutional or conditional deletion of critical Crnde
sequences. In this proposal, we will leverage our new understanding of this lncRNA, and the novel resources
we have generated, in order to dissect the molecular function of CRNDE and define its role in normal
physiology and in RCC pathogenesis in vivo. These experiments will take advantage of our extensive
experience, and that of our collaborators, in evaluating noncoding RNA functions and RCC biology using
cellular and animal models. Successful completion of the proposed research will address two major knowledge
gaps in the fields of RNA biology and cancer biology: 1) our limited understanding of the molecular
mechanisms-of-action of lncRNAs; and 2) how these mechanisms are co-opted by cancer cells to promote
tumor growth, particularly in RCC. We anticipate that the principles revealed by these studies will be broadly
applicable to our understanding of the roles of other lncRNAs in cancer cells and may set the stage for
developing therapeutics that target CRNDE or the pathways it controls."

Eukaryotic cells sequester critical biochemical reactions into discrete membranous compartments, whereby
membrane dynamics driven by protein catalysts facilitate differentiation, communication, and spatial organization
of intracellular compartments. Within a cell, mitochondria are mainly organized into highly interconnected
networks, whose diverse functions are dependent on their complex structure and organization. In humans, OPA1
and MICOS are essential biomolecular machines that control not only the morphology of the mitochondrial
reticulum, but also the efficiency of many key mitochondrial processes, including oxidative phosphorylation,
metabolism, apoptosis, and mtDNA maintenance. The GTPase OPA1 is crucial for mitochondrial IM fusion and
regulating cristae dynamics, whereas the multi-component MICOS complex plays a dual role by shaping IM
cristae junctions and forming contact sites with the outer membrane. Characterizing how mitochondrial dynamics
are realized and regulated will be essential to deciphering the link between mitochondrial morphology and
function. Moreover, molecular abnormalities in mitochondrial dynamics result in aberrant mitochondrial structure,
impaired bioenergetics, severely reduced respiratory capacity, mtDNA instability, increased sensitivity to
apoptosis, and development of a wide variety of disease conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders,
diverse cancers, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases. Yet, the molecular mechanisms that alter mitochondrial
morphology and function remain incompletely understood. Here, using a combination of cellular and structural
analyses, we aim to develop a molecular understanding of mitochondrial dynamics that govern key physiological
processes in cells. We propose to determine the molecular mechanism of mitochondrial morphogenesis by
exploring the assembly mechanism of OPA1 and its interactions with the mitochondrial lipid cardiolipin (Aim 1).
We further propose to characterize the molecular details of multi-component MICOS complex and protein
dynamics that facilitate cristae formation and maintain the characteristic architecture of mitochondria (Aim 2).
Structural and functional studies of mitochondrial protein machines will provide a platform to identify the basis of
pathologies linked to human disease and age-related illness. Understanding the precise molecular mechanisms
of mitochondrial dynamics will increase the probability of success in developing new therapeutic interventions."
10889149,"ABSTRACT
There are fundamental gaps in our understanding of how genome-wide functional genetic
variation in host-parasite interactions is shaped by natural selection, including for humans.
Parasitic helminths (including nematodes) present important selective agents on host traits and
underlying genetic variation. Geographic clines in infection pressure, as helminths are ectothermic
(temperature-sensitive), may drive genomic and phenotypic variation across host populations.
This, in turn, may influence parasite adaptation. However, mechanistically linking agents of
selection with targeted traits and their underlying genetic architecture in hosts and parasites
remains formidably challenging. Only when resolved, will we understand how selection drives
evolution of host resistance and immune system suppression and evasion by parasites. The
investigator’s long-term goal is to gain mechanistic understanding, including of the genetic
architecture of key host and parasite traits. The laboratory’s five-year objective is to identify these
key traits, investigate their genetic basis, and functionally verify genetic variants regulating them.
The core hypothesis is that coevolving hosts and parasites exert selection, pressuring one
another to adapt through genetic and phenotypic changes. The rationale is that populations of
plants and their nematode parasites, as genetically tractable model systems, show spatial and
temporal variation in infection rates, which has a genetic basis, allowing comprehensive
mechanistic studies of this issue. Working off the investigator’s prior research and robust
preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested through: 1) identifying genome-wide changes
underlying geographic variation in plant resistance to nematode parasitism, and 2) determining
genetic mechanisms and constraints underlying host resistance-breaking in nematodes. An
evolutionary systems biology approach will identify genes, genetic networks and genomic variants
underlying adaptive traits. This will be combined with parasite resurrection ecology and
experimental evolution to study real-time evolutionary change. The investigator showed
previously that such approaches will successfully identify key traits and genes involved in species
interactions. Molecular genetic experiments will link candidate adaptive genetic variants with
functional traits and fitness. This innovative research program will form a key step toward
integrative comprehension of how host-parasite interactions are shaped by selection on
phenotypic and genome-wide genetic variation. It holds promise for uncovering general principles
relating to how host-parasite interactions evolve, helping predict sustainability of human
interventions in shaping such interactions towards better outcomes for humans."

We propose to study the relationship between the structure, dynamics, and function of enzymes
by examining how changes to their conformational ensembles regulate their catalytic functions.
Understanding this relationship is critical for understanding macromolecular phenomena such
as allosteric regulation, yet it remains difficult, because the relevant conformational changes
involve a hierarchy of motions that occur across broad lengthscales (sub-Å to multi-nm) and
timescales (ps-s). Our lab is developing a new generation of structural measurements that
combine temperature perturbations with static and time-resolved X-ray crystallography, allowing
us to explore the conformational landscapes of protein molecules in detail. We aim to apply
these methods to temperature-sensitive orthologs from key enzyme families, including kinases,
proteases, and ATP-dependent chaperones, to understand how changes to their conformational
ensembles modulate their biological functions. The specific goals of our work are: (1) Use multi-
temperature X-ray crystallography, combined with traditional biochemical and biophysical
assays, to quantify the relationship between conformational states and catalytic activity. (2)
Characterize previously invisible conformational states of enzymes, including cryptic pockets
that can be targeted for drug discovery, using time-resolved temperature-jump crystallography.
(3) Continue developing new hardware and software to improve the collection and analysis of
data from multi-temperature and temperature-jump crystallography. Our research represents a
novel approach to understanding how the balance of active and inactive conformations drives
the regulation of protein function. Successful completion will yield new information about the
structure-function relationships of biologically and clinically important enzymes and provide new
opportunities for targeting them with therapeutics. We expect that similar changes to protein
conformational ensembles underlie thermal regulation and other types of allosteric regulation in
these enzyme families, and therefore we expect our results to be generally useful in
understanding allosteric regulation more broadly. Finally, our work will develop a framework for
studying the relationship between protein structure, dynamics, and function that exploits the
response of protein conformational ensembles to temperature, and we aim to democratize the
use of multi-temperature and temperature-jump crystallography as a general tool for the
structural biology community."

SRI International and a group of collaborators propose to further develop the Escherichia coli EcoCyc database (DB).
EcoCyc is and will continue to be freely and openly available, and is accessible to scientists through the Internet, as
downloadable data ﬁles, and as a downloadable software application.
 Scientists from multiple disciplines make wide use of EcoCyc; it has been cited 4,939 times, and from 2019–
2021, an average of 94,800 users per year visited the EcoCyc website. It serves as a general reference source on
E. coli for experimental biologists and is particularly useful for the analysis of functional-genomics experiments.
The DB serves computational biologists who are undertaking global studies of E. coli; metabolic engineers who are
developing new methods for chemicals production, including biofuels; and researchers and bioinformaticists who
are using EcoCyc as the gold-standard dataset to develop new computational methods, including the prediction of
operons, promoters, and protein functional linkages. Educators also use the DB.
 We will update EcoCyc in an ongoing fashion to reﬂect new information about the genes, metabolic pathways,
and regulatory interactions of these important model organisms. Information will be integrated from the biomed-
ical literature and from large-scale experiments, such as data on gene essentiality, on nutrients supporting growth,
and on protein interactions. We will continue a comprehensive and ongoing effort to reﬁne steady-state metabolic
network models of these organisms by validating model predictions against many conditions of growth and non-
growth for wildtype and knock-out strains. The resulting models will have applications in anti-microbial drug
discovery and metabolic engineering, and the model development process will lead to many improvements in the
EcoCyc DB.
 We will launch a new effort to curate the genes and proteins of E. coli strains other than the strain served by
EcoCyc. Thousands of E. coli strains have been sequenced; yet in many cases, their genome annotations are of low
quality. We will project curated gene annotations from EcoCyc and from other E. coli strains to orthologs of those
genes in the BioCyc DBs for hundreds of other E. coli strains, thus signiﬁcantly improving the annotation quality of
other E. coli strains in a cost-effective fashion.
 The project will also expand the Pathway Tools software used to query and analyze EcoCyc, such as adding a
tool for projecting newly curated gene and protein annotations to orthologs in other E. coli strains."
10889177,"Summary
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with deficits in two core domains: social
interaction and communication, and repetitive behaviors or restrictive behaviors. It is diagnosed four times
more frequently in boys than in girls. Among a large number of risk loci for ASD, elevated protein synthesis has
been recognized as a converging pathological mechanism. ASD is associated with a high percentage of
patients with inactivating mutations in genes for several negative translation regulators, such as PTEN, TSC1,
TSC2 and FMR1. These mutations increase the availability of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E),
consequently elevating translation of a selective group of mRNAs. However, it remains unknown in which type
of brain cells and how elevated translation leads to dysfunction of neural circuits and subsequently ASD
behaviors. We have generated a knock-in mouse strain in which eIF4E is overexpressed from the Rosa26
locus in a Cre-dependent manner. We found that eIF4E overexpression in microglia, but not neurons or
astrocytes, led to ASD-like synaptic and behavioral aberrations only in male mice, including increased dendritic
spine density, excitation/inhibition imbalance, social interaction impairment, increased repetitive behavior, and
selective cognitive deficits. We further found that microglial eIF4E overexpression elevated translation in both
sexes but only increased microglial density and size in males. Given critical roles of microglia in synapse
development, we posit that elevated synthesis of some proteins alters microglial functions only in male mice,
which in turn impairs synapse development and thereby male-biased ASD. We will test this hypothesis in the
following three specific aims. Aim 1 is to investigate the molecular mechanism by which elevated protein
synthesis alters microglia; Aim 2 is to understand the mechanism underlying the sexual dimorphism of ASD-
like phenotypes in MG4E mice; Aim 3 is to determine how microglial alterations impact synapse development by
imaging in vivo dynamics of dendritic spines and microglia in control and MG4E mice. This research project will
not only provide insights into the pathological mechanism by which mutations in negative translation regulators
lead to ASD, but also show microglial dysfunction as a possible etiology of ASD. It may also uncover a
mechanism that underlies the strong male bias of ASD, which could guide strategies for innovative therapies of
the disorder."

The overall goal of this K23 proposal is to provide Trisha Parekh, D.O., with the career development and
research experience necessary to allow her to become an independent researcher in chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) health disparities, with expertise in social care integration and psychological stress
reduction in low-income communities using community health worker interventions. Disadvantages of social
determinants of health, such as low socioeconomic status, are associated with adverse outcomes in COPD,
including more frequent hospitalizations, early readmissions, and increased mortality. A majority of
interventions to reduce readmission focus on addressing medical determinants of health, with a notable
absence of addressing social needs that impede better health outcomes. The psychological stress associated
with poverty and other disadvantages of social determinants of health can lead to negative downstream
behavioral, psychological, and physiological effects. For COPD patients, these stress responses may include
increased tobacco use, increased risk of anxiety or depression, or increased systemic inflammation, all of
which are risk factors for acute exacerbations of COPD. Substantial knowledge gaps on the social
determinants of health, their associated levels of perceived stress in COPD, and clinical outcomes associated
with high levels stress in marginalized groups must be addressed in order to reduce health disparities and
improve quality of life for these individuals. In this K23 proposal, under the guidance of an expert mentorship
team, Dr. Parekh will conduct a mixed methods research study to inform the development of a targeted
community health worker-led stress reduction intervention in low-income COPD patients that will focus on 1)
addressing unmet social needs, 2) providing COPD disease education, and 3) promoting proactive coping
behaviors. The specific aims for this research project are as follows: Aim 1: Identify modifiable social
determinant of health predictors and clinical outcomes of perceived stress in COPD patients; Aim 2:
Understand perceived stressful experiences in high-risk COPD patients; Aim 3: Develop and test the feasibility
of a community health worker intervention to reduce stress in low-income COPD patients. At the completion of
Aim 3, this intervention will be ready to be tested in a R-series grant funded randomized controlled pilot with
the primary outcome of stress reduction and secondary outcomes of reduction in acute care use and tobacco
use and improvement in quality of life. At the conclusion of this K23, Dr. Parekh will have the training and
experience needed to transition to a successful independent investigator who has an expertise in COPD health
disparities."

10926852,"ABSTRACT – BIOSTATISTICS AND BIOINFORMATICS CORE (CORE C)
The Ovarian SPORE Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core provides statistical and bioinformatic collaboration
and data management support for each of the main SPORE projects, the Developmental Research Program
(DRP) and Career Enhancement Program (CEP) projects, and the other Cores. As in Years 1-5, Core C
members have continued in Years 6-10 to collaborate heavily with SPORE researchers to facilitate optimal
study design, create analysis plans, and interpret results. In addition, Core members also improved the data
infrastructure by consolidating the biospecimens, clinical and animal models databases into one
comprehensive data management system. This migration has resulted in improved efficiencies for Biostatistics
and Bioinformatics Core members as well as Animal Models Core members, Biospecimens and Patient
Registry Core members, and study coordinator staff. This database system is utilized not only by Ovarian
SPORE researchers, but also by institutional ovarian cancer researchers. It is a source of accurate, up-to-date
information and has facilitated both intra- and inter-SPORE collaborations. Members also developed an
improved investigator request portal and tracking database for SPORE biospecimen and core resource
requests.
In this renewal, the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core will be very active in preparing the analytical plan for
each Project. The proposed projects are expected to span a wide range of approaches and analyses. The
Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core will continue to assure each SPORE investigator access to statistical and
bioinformatic expertise that includes collaborative development of study designs and analysis plans, state-of-
the-art data analysis and interpretation, data management resources, and abstract and manuscript
preparation. In addition, Core members will continue to improve existing database infrastructure. The
Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core builds upon the innovative and time-tested procedures and systems
developed by Mayo Clinic, one of the largest statistical groups in the country, whose members have
collaborated on clinical and basic science research studies since 1932. This Core complements and assists
the efforts of the Biospecimens and Patient Registry Core and Animal Models Core by providing superior data
management and experience with biospecimen registries. Through these collaborative activities, the
Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core will help ensure that research in this SPORE is carried out in an efficient,
effective, and rigorous manner."
10926858,"ABSTRACT – ANIMAL MODELS CORE (CORE D)
The goals of the Animal Models Core (Core D) of the Mayo Clinic Ovarian SPORE are to improve understanding
of ovarian cancer and enhance the development of novel therapies by providing clinically relevant models that
will be highly translatable, thereby helping investigators bring these treatments into clinical practice. Accordingly,
we will use models developed from our large orthotopic patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumor bank to test novel
therapies in three of four projects. These models were initiated through support from the SPORE, an R01, and
other funding sources during Years 1-10, and recapitulate the histologic and molecular features of the source
tumors in SCID mice. Importantly, they also recapitulate key clinical features of the source tumors: 1) spread in
the peritoneal cavity and production of ascites mimic the patient counterpart; and 2) the responses of PDXs to
platinum/taxane therapy closely parallel the responses of source patients. Since the last competitive renewal,
we have developed 410 new models (for a cumulative total of 661), improved engraftment efficiency, developed
methods to seamlessly transfer study data to Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core (Core C), and successfully
developed ex vivo 3D culture methods. We will continue collaborating with Core C and the Biospecimens and
Patient Registry Core (Core B) to select appropriate models based on source patient (e.g., clinical parameters
or germline genotypes) or PDX characteristics (e.g., drug sensitivity, gene expression) and expand them for use
in experiments. Each experiment will include molecular sample identification controls to assure the genetic
fidelity of the individual models. In addition, in Years 11-15, we will collaborate with investigators on Projects 1
and 3 to provide immunocompetent models. To ensure that all animal experimentation can be performed in a

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is an increasingly common relapsing-remitting skin disease characterized by chronic
allergic inflammation and itch. The etiology of AD is unknown, but type 2 cytokines, particularly interleukin (IL)-
4 and IL-13, are involved in driving AD and AD-like pathology, as demonstrated by the efficacy of therapies
targeting these cytokines in human AD. Among type 2 cytokine producers, basophils and group 2 innate
lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are dysregulated in human AD and are major sources of type 2 cytokines in mouse
models of allergic inflammation, yet how these cells are triggered in AD and AD-like disease remain
unresolved. Our recent single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) analysis identified high expression of IL-18
receptor (IL-18R, Il18r1) among skin ILC2s in comparison to ILC2s isolated from other tissues, and we further
observed robust production of type 2 cytokines from IL-18-stimulated skin ILC2s, indicating that IL-18 is a
candidate driver of type 2 cytokine production in AD-associated allergic skin inflammation. Basophils are also
potently activated by IL-18 to produce type 2 cytokines, and our studies have demonstrated that basophils
mediate acute itch flares in the context of AD-like disease, suggesting that IL-18 may mediate aspects of AD-
related itch. Additionally, we find that IL-18 is elevated in both the skin and plasma of patients with moderate-
to-severe AD, and that ILC2s and basophils exhibit unique activation profiles in human AD. Together, these
data suggest that IL-18 mediates ILC2 and basophil functions to influence itch and AD pathogenesis. Thus, we
hypothesize that IL-18 is a key regulator and potential therapeutic target in AD. In this project, we will
determine how IL-18 influences basophil and ILC2 effector functions in the context of AD-associated
inflammation and itch behavior. To do this, we will test several novel mouse strains in models of AD-like skin
inflammation and translate these findings to human AD settings using innovative spatial transcriptomics
approaches. We plan to test our hypothesis and accomplish our overall objective by pursuing three specific
aims: 1. Test the contribution of IL-18 to skin ILC2 responses and AD-like disease. 2. Determine whether IL-18
activates basophils to trigger acute itch flares. 3. Examine the relationships between IL-18, ILC2s, and
basophils in human AD by spatial transcriptomics. Understanding of how IL-18 contributes to the initiation and
propagation of AD in mouse models and in human disease may advance new therapeutic approaches
designed to ameliorate inflammation and itch in AD."

Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation pathway that maintains cellular homeostasis under basal and
stress conditions by catabolizing cellular constituents to produce energy and building blocks. Although
autophagy is common to all eukaryotic cells, highly specialized cells exploit this pathway to support their
unique physiological functions. One such example is cone photoreceptors, where autophagy promotes
survival during periods of metabolic or light-induced stress. The function of cones as our daytime
photoreceptors depends critically on the rapid recovery of their sensitivity after exposure to bright light, a
process known as dark adaptation. This metabolically-demanding process is driven by the turnover of
chromophore for the regeneration of cone visual pigment and by the resetting of the efficiency of synaptic
transmission between cones and cone bipolar cells. As autophagy is intimately involved in cellular
metabolism, we will test the novel hypothesis that autophagy modulates the cone-driven photopic dark
adaptation. We will perform experiments to determine the physiological conditions that activate autophagy
in cones, focusing on bright light exposure, fasting, and physical exercise. We will also determine the
subcellular compartments in cones where autophagy is upregulated in response to a range of stress
conditions. To investigate the role of autophagy in cone-driven photopic dark adaptation, we will perform
electrophysiological experiments to determine how fasting, exercise, or genetic block of autophagy affect
the recovery of photopic function following exposure to bright light. Finally, we will evaluate two alternative
mechanisms by which autophagy could be modulating photopic dark adaptation, either by accelerating
the turnover of visual chromophore or by enhancing synaptic transmission. These experiments will
establish autophagy as a novel mechanism for regulating the function of mammalian cone photoreceptors
and photopic vision. They will also pave the way for future translational studies with humans seeking to
prevent vision loss and enhance photopic vision by intermittent fasting or exercise."
10879132,"––– PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT ––––––––––––––––– The Genetics of Impulsivity and Motivation –––
One way to isolate novel genes contributing to addiction is to focus on endophenotypes, more circumscribed
biological and behavioral markers well-correlated with the substance use disorder (SUD). Impulsivity, making
rash decisions and ‘bad’/costly choices, and motivation, the impetus for goal-directed behavior and the
willingness to incur effort or cost to reach said goal, are key behavioral domains that are common to all SUDs,
but their genetic underpinnings are poorly understood. The vinegar fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has been a
genetic model organism for more than a hundred years. Major strides have been made in the last 15 years
studying the behavioral responses to alcohol and other drugs of abuse in flies, both in characterizing novel
conserved genes and pathways, but also in the development of new assays that resemble endophenotypes of
addiction more closely. The goal of this proposal is to isolate, validate, and functionally characterize genes that
affect a novel model of impulsivity and motivation. In our newly developed Fly Liquid-food Electroshock Assay
(FLEA), Drosophila choose between two wells of liquid food that are paired with two distinct electroshocks,
allowing us to ask whether flies prefer high shock/high sucrose, or low shock/low sucrose. Importantly, when
flies are food deprived, they change their relative valuation of shock/sucrose and prefer the high shock/high
sucrose. Commonly used animal models for impulsivity, e.g. the delay discounting task, are insensitive to
deprivation. Conversely, humans do act more impulsively when deprived, e.g. shifting towards a smaller drug
dose now, rather than a larger ‘hit’ later. Therefore, our novel FLEA assay models some important aspects of
human impulsivity that are highly relevant for SUD. We will combine the economy of scale of Drosophila with
the unique face validity of our innovative FLEA assay to illuminate the genes and variants that underlie impulsivity
and motivation to 1) determine the role M6 plays in impulsivity and motivation. M6 is the fly ortholog of the human
candidate impulsivity gene GPM6B. 2) We will perform a GWAS with ~200 fully sequenced Drosophila lines,
giving us unprecedented insight into variants and genes that affect impulsivity and motivation. This will serve to
seed new avenues of research to investigate the function and circuitry regulating impulsivity and motivation. We
will also test candidate genes from these Aims in our just developed assays measuring experience-dependent
amphetamine or cocaine preference. Our proposal is therefore fully compatible with the Cutting-Edge Basic
Research Award (CEBRA) which is “not intended for incremental research or research extending ongoing
programs”, but rather “this announcement encourages applications from investigators with experience in SUD-
relevant research who wish to explore and develop new methods, techniques or conceptual frameworks to study
basic questions in this research area” (PAR-21-208)."

For most patients with end-stage kidney failure, kidney transplantation confers longer survival, better quality of
life, and lower cost, relative to dialysis. Despite these benefits, too few patients make it through the complex
transplant evaluation process, and long-standing racial and socioeconomic inequities exist in access to each
transplant step, including referral, start and completion of the transplant evaluation, and placement on the
waiting list. In 2010, with the explicit goal of improving equity in access to transplant in the US Southeastern
region that includes Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina, we created the Southeastern Kidney
Transplant Coalition, a community of transplant stakeholders, including patients, caregivers, medical
professionals, patient advocacy groups, and health system administrators that encompasses all 10 transplant
centers in these states and large dialysis organizations serving a population of >50,000 patients with kidney
failure. Since its inception, our Coalition has conducted several pragmatic interventions of educational and
quality improvement activities at the dialysis facility, provider, and patient levels, finding increased rates of
referral and evaluation start, and reduced racial disparities in these outcomes among Black vs. White patients
and those with lower vs. higher socioeconomic status. Unfortunately, health system barriers persist after
referral and education: more than half of patients referred did not start the transplant evaluation, and 65% of
those referred were never waitlisted. However, prior interventions were limited to interventions at the patient-
and dialysis facility-levels and did not address the structural barriers in the complex process across the health
systems that patients must navigate to get a transplant, including both dialysis facilities and transplant centers.
In surveys of health system staff and a scoping review, we identified persistent health system barriers to
transplant equity, including scheduling logistics, inadequate provider communication across health systems,
and limited transplant provider awareness of inequities. In this proposed RaDIANT Health Systems
intervention, we will leverage proven interventions from our research and use a community-based participatory
research approach to adapt and enhance sustainability of the RaDIANT interventions targeting structural
barriers to evaluation start at the health system level (Aim 1). We will then conduct a hybrid type 1
effectiveness-implementation quasi-experimental study of the RaDIANT Health System intervention among 4
Southeastern transplant centers and ~800 dialysis facilities in GA, NC, and SC with a goal of reducing racial
and socioeconomic inequities in transplant access (Aim 2). Finally, we will conduct a process evaluation
among the participating health systems to assess acceptability, usability, implementation, and sustainability of
interventions (Aim 3). If successful, interventions could be adapted and scaled nationally, where our health
system partners are committed to equity in access to kidney transplantation."
10920460,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Patients suffering from type 1 diabetes must undergo burdensome, often lifelong, exogenous insulin
dependence. Up to now, the only available replacement therapy is to transplant islets from cadaveric donors.
However, such procedures present hurdles such as the scarcity of available donors and the rejection of
transplanted cells by the patient’s immune system. Also, over time, the transplanted islets tend to die. Several
types of stem cells, including embryonic stem cell and induced pluripotent stem cell, have been extensively
studied to generate glucose-responsive insulin-secreting cells and represents a more tenable source of islets.
However, a significant concern for transplantation therapy is the need for immunosuppressive drugs, which
exhibit long term side effects and hinders the feasibility of this approach to the large population of T1D patients.
Furthermore, cost-effective and large-scale production of these stem cell-derived beta cells is still a major
challenge. We propose to apply chemical biology and genome engineering approaches to develop platforms
for efficient sorting, production, and editing of these beta cells.

 The purpose of this project is to optimize circuit and system architectures of active electrode arrays which will
provide low-noise, multiplexed acquisition of neural signals from thousands of electrodes. We will reduce noise
by exploiting a novel current-sensing circuit approach and new multiplexing strategies, such as Code-Division
Multiple Access (CDMA). We will also apply novel system level de-noising approaches using kriging. Finally, we
will demonstrate our low noise, active arrays using a unique, ultra-flexible 3D neural interface paradigm:
Neuro-CROWN: CMOS-based, ROlling-enabled, loW-noise Neuroelectronics. These electrode arrays include
thousands of electrodes that can be used for both recording and stimulation, enabling studies that require
recordings from multiple, large cortical regions in rodents and non-human primates (NHP) at cellular scale. The
electrode arrays are extremely thin (<25 µm) and flexible, and are made in both non-penetrating and 3D
penetrating configurations, of which the latter will be formed from a simple and unique rolling of 2D soft electrode
array (ROSE) method. Amplifiers and multiplexers integrated directly into the electrode array, using commercially
fabricated silicon transistors, intelligently combine signals inside the array so that recording from up to 4,096
electrodes is possible with fewer than 20 multiplexed external wire connections. The small number of interface
wires facilitates long-term experiments in chronically-implanted, freely-behaving animals and eases future
wireless integration. The electrode arrays will be manufactured in large quantities (3800 devices / run) using full
wafers at X-fab. By leveraging a cost-effective manufacturing process, the raw materials cost of each electrode
array will be ~$10, excluding post processing labor which will be supplied by this program.
 Our dissemination program will make device broadly available to a large cohort of end users. We have
previously disseminated early-stage technology to ~10 labs are now scaling up to disseminate that technology
to ~100 labs. Based on feedback we received during this dissemination effort, neural interfaces with high SNR
and 3-dimensional measurement are critically important to neuroscience research, motivating this project. We
will disseminate this new technology to at least 10 labs in this effort, solicited from the neuroscience community
at large. We will solicit end user feedback through a workshop at the Society for Neuroscience (SfN) meeting
and use this feedback to shape our device designs.
 This project seeks to enable BRAIN Initiative investigators and the broader neuroscience community to
perform very large-scale recordings in animal models. Further, the research enabled by this technology will be
able to be rapidly translated to humans in the future, through parallel, separately-funded efforts by our team to
bring actively-multiplexed electrode arrays to human use."

10890715,"The integrity of the human genome is constantly challenged by
environmental and cellular stresses, resulting in various DNA damage and gene
mutations. Many proteins have evolved to rapidly detect, signal, and repair DNA
damage inside living cells, forming an orchestrated network known as DNA
damage response (DDR). Unsurprisingly, DDR defects, such as DNA repair protein
mutations, are often linked to human diseases, including developmental
abnormalities, accelerated aging, and common cancers. The past decades of
biochemical and genetic research have generated a wealth of knowledge
regarding the identities of DDR factors, their roles in genome maintenance, and
how they contribute to the diseases when they go awry. However, the detailed
spatiotemporal parameters by which DDR factors mediate DNA repair remain
largely elusive. What timescales do DDR factors search for and bind to damaged
DNA in living cells? Do DDR factors form specific structures to facilitate an
accurate repair? How does DNA damage regulate other nuclear DNA activities,
such as transcription? This research program aims to address these fundamental
questions by investigating DDR dynamics during DNA double-strand break (DSB)
repair. DSB is one of the most genotoxic DNA damage types frequently occurring
in our bodies. Recently, we have established an experimental platform that allows
quantitative visualization of DDR factors and on-demand DSB induction at specific
genomic loci and with a second-scale temporal resolution, a capability achieved
by marrying high-resolution fluorescence microscopy with the very fast
(vf)CRISPR technique pioneered by our lab. Here, we will take full advantage of
this novel platform and comprehensively map the DSB-induced dynamics of DDR
factors, chromosome translocation, and activities of transcription and cGAS in
single human cells. This study will strongly complement DSB repair research
conventionally performed in test tubes and at the ensemble level, providing
valuable mechanistic insights into DSB repair with unprecedented resolutions."

 In chemical biology, precise bottom-up synthesis bridging the microscopic and macroscopic world is an
ultimate goal. Recent advancements in nanoparticles have yielded biomedical tools with tailorable properties
and exceptional strength in overcoming the hurdles associated with conventional passive/diffusion-based
diagnostic and therapeutic drugs. However, conventional nanoparticles are inherently polydisperse, and
therefore generally lack the precision and uniformity that are needed for the robust quantification and
reproducibility in biomedical research, and for the quality control in scaling up and long-term storage in future
applications. Fullerenes are nm-sized molecules that would hold their size and shape as a rigid multivalent core
like inorganic particles, and allow for organic reactions to introduce biological properties and functions via robust
C-C covalent bonds. In our group, we utilize a characteristic hexakisadduct of fullerene C60 as a core scaffold
and modular platform to develop a series of precise “molecular nanoparticles” with desirable surface function,
multivalency, and size, for novel magnetic resonance imaging and fluorescence imaging probes. Our work
comprises four conceptually independent, but technically synergistic Research Themes.
 In the first Theme, MRI probes with multivalent targeting to cancer cells, we will build on our recently
developed “metallobuckytrio” (MBT), to develop precise molecular nanoparticles with Gd-containing endohedral
metallofullerene and biochemical ligands for next-generation MRI contrast agents. These MRI probes will check
all the “wish list items” in future MRI probes: Gd heavy-metal safety, high relaxivity, structural precision, and
biochemical specificity. In the second Theme, FullerFISH with fast and quantitative signal amplification, we will
synthesize multivalent molecular constructs to amplify RNA-FISH signals with 10-30 dyes, to facilitate the
detection and quantification of short of low-abundance RNA molecules. In the third Theme, signal amplifying and
antioxidative probes for live cell imaging and smFRET imaging, we will exploit the anti-oxidative property and
multivalency of the hexakisadduct fullerene nanoparticles, load them with organic dyes, to develop
photobleaching-resistant and signal-amplifying imaging probes. In the fourth Theme, precise ratiometric
nanoprobes, we will introduce bioresponsive dyes and “always on” reference dyes in accurate 1:1 ratio and exact
colocalization onto the antioxidative, multivalent fullerene nanoparticles to achieve ratiometric imaging for
sensing and tracking biological events.
 These four Themes will combine our synthetic expertise to turn C60 into precise molecular nanoparticles with
desirable ligands, with the resourceful library of nanoparticle and small-molecule research, to marry the precision
of molecules and the multivalency and multiplexity of nanoparticles in chemical biology. With the modular nature
of our synthetic platform, we anticipate the proposed technology will be adopted by broader biological
communities with many new bottom-up designs and ligands by choice."

Mitochondria are complex organelles found in virtually all eukaryotic cells. These organelles orchestrate diverse
functions such as energy expenditure, nutrient selection, and ion homeostasis, and do so through the
coordination of over 1,000 mitochondria-resident proteins. Most of these mitochondrial proteins are
phosphorylated under select physiological conditions, but surprisingly little has been done to characterize these
organellar modifications. Motivated by the observation that mitochondria house numerous protein phosphatases,
we predicted that regulated protein phosphorylation may play a larger role in organellar homeostasis than is
currently appreciated. Indeed, our studies show that the knockout of one mitochondrial phosphatase, Pptc7,
leads to stark metabolic dysfunction culminating in fully penetrant perinatal lethality in mice. This surprisingly
severe pathophysiology indicates that proper management of protein phosphorylation is requisite for
mitochondrial homeostasis. Despite these data, it remains unclear how mitochondrial proteins become
phosphorylated and the extent to which individual phosphorylation events contribute to mitochondrial function.
We will begin to address these gaps in knowledge by mapping the full breadth of substrates of matrix-localized
kinases and by testing the cellular compartment in which mitochondrial-destined proteins become
phosphorylated. These studies will begin to address longstanding questions as to the mechanisms enabling
mitochondrial protein phosphorylation as well as and the genetic identities of its regulators. To complement this
work, we will utilize mechanistic, hypothesis-driven approaches to test the effects of phosphorylation on two
proteins, Timm50 and Idh2. These two proteins are reproducibly hyperphosphorylated in Pptc7 KO conditions,
suggesting they drive at least a subset of the stark phenotypes associated with the knockout of this phosphatase.
Furthermore, these two proteins play key roles in mitochondrial protein import and TCA cycle-mediated
metabolism and their regulation would likely have broad influence on mitochondrial function. We will test the
effects of Timm50 and Idh2 phosphorylation at the biochemical level (determining how this modification affects
protein functions), at the cellular level (determining how modulation of these phosphorylation events affect
organellar processes such as protein import and metabolic flux), and at the organismal level (testing how
phosphorylation of these proteins may mediate pathophysiology – particularly of phenotypes manifested in Pptc7
KO mice). Collectively, this work will link kinases to mitochondrial function and will establish a workflow to
delineate the functions of individual phosphorylation events from the biochemical to the physiological level. As
kinases are druggable and have had positive clinical impact in human disease, these studies may uncover novel
therapeutic targets through which we can resolve mitochondrial dysfunction found across human pathologies."
10915648,"Developmental disorders (DD) are severe and chronic disabilities that often leads to early childhood death,
or long-term morbidity in the survivors. Due to the high burden of infectious disease in many African
countries, active research into rare diseases such as DD has often been neglected. The genetic aetiology of
DD is complex as DD syndromes are marked by both clinical- and genetic heterogeneity. The Deciphering
Developmental Disorders in Africa study (DDD-Africa) was initiated to address this knowledge gap, and the
resource that was built holds the potential for much discovery, especially by catalyzing new collaborations
and through the application of data science approaches. We therefore propose to use the clinical
information, genetic data, and DNA resources from the DDD-Africa study to investigate the following
hypotheses:
1. An exome-based CNV calling workflow that incorporates different tools, will identify putative disease-
 causing structural variants, and increase the diagnostic yield for DD-ID patients.
2. Identifying genome-wide DNA methylations patterns will assist in diagnosing genetically unsolved
 African DD-ID patients.
3. Phenotype-aware, artificial intelligence software can improve genotype-phenotype correlation in
 African DD-ID patients.
Through this study, we will increase the diagnostic yield of DD-ID in African patients and broaden the
knowledge discovery potential for rare diseases in Africa. This work will furthermore increase health data
science capacity in Africa and create an ecosystem that can provide local solutions for rare diseases such
as DD in Africa."

Non-tuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM) are ubiquitous environmental bacteria comprising rapid- and slow-
growing (RGM and SGM) opportunistic pathogens and causing tuberculosis (TB)-like lung disease in patients
with pre-existing lung conditions or compromised immunity. The most frequently encountered RGM and SGM
are Mycobacterium abscessus and the M. avium complex (MAC), respectively. Other clinically important NTM
include M. fortuitum and M. chelonae (RGM), and M. kansasii, M. genavense, M. xenopi, and M. simiae (SGM).
The often multiyear-long treatment consists of mostly repurposed and underperforming antibiotic combinations.
For many NTM diseases, there is no reliable curative regimen and mortality is high Our overarching goal is to
optimize rifamycins to overcome intrinsic resistance and improve treatment of NTM lung disease.
Rifampicin (RIF) is the pillar of TB therapy owing to its exquisite potency against the obligate pathogen M.
tuberculosis (Mtb), favorable pharmacokinetics and excellent penetration to the sites of disease. Although RIF
is recommended for the treatment of all SGM pulmonary diseases but M. simiae, its therapeutic utility has not
been established except for M. kansasii disease, in line with RIF being similarly potent against M. kansasii and
Mtb but poorly active against all other NTMs. Rifamycins do not achieve acceptable efficacy against most NTM
diseases due to intrinsic bacterial resistance not associated with polymorphisms or mutations in their target, the
RpoB subunit of the RNA polymerase. Rather, we have shown that M. abscessus undergoes intrabacterial
metabolism by rifamycin monooxygenase(s) (ROX) and ADP-ribosylase (Arr). Through systematic genomics
searches, we have identified these metabolic enzymes in all major RGM and several SGM. M. kansassii, in line
with its favorable response to rifampicin treatment, is Arr-negative. Rifamycin glycosylases and phosphorylases,
discovered in other bacteria, are potential additional candidates contributing to intrinsic resistance in some NTM.
We propose to characterize the species-specific rifamycin resistome of NTMs and exploit this knowledge to
overcome intrinsic resistance and rationally optimize the rifamycin class to improve the treatment of NTM lung
disease. Using ROX-resistant rifabutin (RBT) as chemical starting point in preliminary studies, we have blocked
ADP-ribosylation, resulting in a dramatic potency improvement against M. abscessus, similar to that of RIF
against Mtb (which does not harbor ROX or Arr). We will expand this approach to appropriate RGM and SGM
species as guided by resistome findings. To deliver a preclinical development candidate for the treatment of M.
abscessus and other Arr-positive NTM lung diseases, medicinal chemistry efforts will focus on reducing plasma
protein binding and removing drug-drug interactions due to cytochrome P450 induction, while maintaining
potency and favorable penetration into lung lesions. Through combination studies in vitro and in mouse models,
we will identify best partner drugs to deliver all-oral bactericidal rifamycin-based combinations that can improve
cure rates and shorten treatment duration."

Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), a region dominated by low-resource communities and relatively poor families, is
experiencing rising HIV prevalence among adolescents and youth (AY). Household economic hardships heighten
the risk for AY’s engaging in health-compromising behaviors and their poor engagement with care. This
increases their risk for contracting and transmitting HIV and non-adherence to ART treatment. Economic
empowerment (EE) interventions have demonstrated substantial promise in reducing HIV-related risk-taking
behaviors, and improving ART treatment adherence and mental health outcomes. Based on 10+ years of
research utilizing savings-led EE interventions focused on HIV prevention, care and support for AY affected by
HIV [AYaAIDS] (including AY living with HIV [AYLHIV]; and AY orphaned by AIDS [AYoAIDS] in SSA, our group
has demonstrated the effectiveness of a multi-component EE intervention, Bridges, in four NIH-funded
randomized control trials (RCT) in Uganda
(R01
HD070727, R01HD074949, R34MH081763, R01MH113486),
and one foundation-funded study in Kenya. Bridges involves: 1) financial literacy training (FLT) and mentorship;
2) family income-generating activities (IGA); and 3) incentivized savings via a matched Youth Development
Account (YDA). Bridges has demonstrated robust effects on HIV-related risk-taking behaviors, ART adherence,
mental health, psychosocial outcomes, educational achievement, family economics, and family cohesion. Yet,
scaling EE interventions has been a challenge, signaling the need to identify and test scale-up strategies and
examine determinants of implementation and sustainment. In Bridges2Scale, we will compare two multifaceted
strategies (standard vs enhanced) for scaling Bridges in a two-arm Hybrid III effectiveness-implementation
cluster RCT. The standard implementation strategy has been applied in our prior RCTs and involves educational
meetings that prepare staff to deliver Bridges with minimal disruption to site workflow. This will be compared to
an enhanced strategy that will be developed using Implementation Mapping. We will use the public school system
to recruit 1440 AYaAIDS (ages 13-17 years) from 48 schools in the Greater Masaka region of Uganda, a region
with 11.7% HIV prevalence. Schools will be the unit of randomization (n=24 schools per arm; n=720 students
per arm). Four specific aims guide our study: Aim 1. Compare the implementation effectiveness of the standard
implementation strategy vs. an enhanced implementation strategy; Aim 2. Determine the clinical effectiveness
of Bridges implemented via a standard vs. enhanced implementation strategy; Aim 3. Explore implementation
processes, mechanisms, and determinants; and Aim 4. Compare the cost and cost-effectiveness of the two
implementation strategies. The study will address a critical challenge: how to best support the implementation,
scale-up, and sustainment of EE interventions, which have been proven to be highly efficacious in improving
youth-focused HIV prevention, care, and support outcomes, but are yet to be widely scaled up."

 Most cell-type specific gene expression arises from transcription factors binding to
enhancers and promoters12,13. The last decade has seen explosive growth in the identification of
enhancers and cataloging of transcription factors binding data14, but it is still not possible to
predict gene expression from genome sequence, in large part because we still have a limited
understanding of transcriptional activation domains, the regions that bind coactivator proteins.
 Our group studies the protein sequence features that control the function of
transcriptional activation domains. We seek to understand how activation domains work, how
they evolve and how we can predict them from protein sequence. To study how activation
domains work, we rationally design mutations to test specific hypotheses. To study activation
domain evolution, we survey the diversity of extant orthologs to find highly diverse functional
sequences. To predict activation domains from protein sequence, we integrate all these data
with interpretable mechanistic predictors and with convolutional neural networks.
 We combine three approaches to study activation domain function. First, we use high
throughput assays in yeast and human cell culture, rationally designed thousands of mutations
to test specific hypotheses about function, and integrate these data with machine learning.
Second, we use biophysical simulations to study how mutations in activation domains change
the 3D structures of these intrinsically disordered regions. Third, we use high-resolution imaging
to study how activation domains modulate the movements of individual transcription factor
molecules in the nuclei of living cells. These three approaches will reveal the amino acid
sequence features that control how activation domains control transcription.
 Our long term goal is to build a family of computational models that predict activation
domains from protein sequence, predict the coactivators each activation domain recruits, and
predict how activation domains evolve."

Mechanotransduction is the process by which cells sense and transduce extracellular mechanical stimuli into
intracellular signaling and gene expression. Mechanotransduction is ubiquitous across diverse organisms and
has significant influences on cell function and behavior, in parallel with chemical and genetic signal transductions.
The mechanics of microenvironments mediate mechanotransduction through cell-microenvironment interactions
and its mis-regulation is at the heart of various pathologies. A major knowledge gap in the field is how mechanical
stimuli from microenvironments are transduced into cellular signaling and what the relationships are between
microenvironmental mechanics, cell signaling, gene expression, and cell functions. We recently discovered that
multiple electrically non-excitable epithelial cell lines can initiate and propagate spontaneous long-distance
intercellular calcium waves (ICWs), when cells are cultured in 2D/3D soft microenvironments, but not in stiff
ones. Because calcium regulates a broad range of essential cell functions, our findings uncover an
unprecedented mechanotransduction nexus between microenvironmental mechanics and diverse cellular
signals. We hypothesize that the cellular actomyosin contractility that is regulated by soft microenvironments
(10s kPa) promotes the initiation and propagation of the long-distance ICWs. In this R35 grant, we propose a
cross-disciplinary research program that systematically elucidates this novel mechanotransduction process and
establishes a framework to bridge the knowledge gap. This will be accomplished by leveraging innovative
approaches such as genetically encoded fluorescent calcium sensors, CRISPR imaging, high-throughput cell
selection, and algorithms to pursue two interrelated research themes. The first theme is the identification of
regulatory mechanisms that initiate the calcium waves by active modulations and live-cell imaging of contractility-
associated proteins. The expected results will provide important molecular insights of the link between
mechanotransduction and the ICWs. The second theme is the dissection of mechanisms through which calcium
waves enhance cell migration and achieve biological functions by manipulating ICWs and investigating the full
transcriptome profiles. The results will advance our understanding of the relationships between
microenvironmental mechanics, cell signaling, gene expression, and cell functions. We envision that the
fundamental principles uncovered in this project will apply broadly to various cell systems and physiological
functions. The long-term objective of our research program is to establish a mechanistic foundation of
mechanobiology and promote the creation of therapeutic strategies which leverage these principles. The success
of this proposal will enable my group to embark in a long-term research direction to tackle a variety of critical and
challenging questions regarding the interplay between mechanotransduction and cell signaling."
10911259,"Project Summary: The cytoskeleton comprised of the actin filaments, microtubules and the intermediate
filaments plays important roles in organelle dynamics including positioning, transport, and crosstalk. While the
microtubules have been significantly defined for their roles in regulating the dynamics of several organelles
including Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, the role of actin filaments in dynamics and interactions
of the ER and mitochondria is largely under-studied. The dominant actin structures visible in a cultured
mammalian cell include the cortical actin, the stress fibers, and the filaments at the leading edge (lamellipodia)
whose prime function is to generate force. However, underneath these overwhelming structures are a myriad of
distinct and dynamic pools of actin filaments which are specifically associated with different organelles and
whose role in organelle and cellular physiology have not been explored. My research has explored two such
actin structures. One of them assembles around the ER, polymerized by an ER-bound actin assembly factor,
INF2. The other pool polymerizes strictly around dysfunctional mitochondria mediated by the Arp2/3 complex
and formin FMNL. My research showed that both these actin structures are polymerized by distinct set of actin
assembly factors and affected ER and mitochondrial dynamics and interactions in contrasting ways. However,
the underlying mechanisms and the downstream consequences of these distinct pools of actin filaments on the
organelles and overall cellular physiology remain to be defined. My proposed work will unify concepts from both
the fields of actin dynamics and organelle biology to understand, both mechanistically and functionally, the
specific roles these actin filaments play in controlling ER and mitochondrial biology, dynamics, and crosstalk. My
proposed research plan will tackle the following key questions: 1) How do dynamic actin pools act as key
regulators of ER-mitochondrial crosstalk; 2) How does the ER associated actin filaments regulate ER function,
and 3) What are the distinct cellular effects of these dynamic actin pools on cellular homeostasis.
The overall goal of my research program is to identify, characterize and understand the roles that these dynamic
pools of actin play in regulating various cellular processes specifically related to organelle dynamics and
crosstalk, critically differentiating, and uncoupling them from being the functional consequences of the cortical
actin cytoskeleton. In the future we aim to apply these concepts in understanding alteration in organelle dynamics
in various pathological system with a hope for specific therapeutic interventions through perturbation of these
specific actin filaments along with its associated assembly factors and other actin binding proteins."

The objective of this Nationwide Children’s Hospital(NCH)/Ohio State University(OSU) institutional T32
postdoctoral program is to provide interdisciplinary, state-of-the-art research training in pediatric heart and
lung diseases. Cardiopulmonary diseases in infants and children are among the most severe type
of pediatric illnesses ranging from congenital malformations and monogenic conditions to acquired
infectious/inflammatory diseases. Our program provides a unique integrated approach to prepare
trainees to become scientists and physician-scientists who will make basic, translational, and clinical
research discoveries through cooperative, collaborative team science. The rationale for this holistic
approach, which spans from molecular discovery and translational approaches using cell and animal
models to human clinical trials, is that these synergistic methods will more rapidly impact patient care and
therapies for children with cardiopulmonary diseases. We will provide an academic environment that
cultivates research training at a leading pediatric research institute affiliated with an internationally
recognized children’s hospital and university. Dynamic ‘bidirectional’ research tracks will allow for clinical
problems to be mechanistically studied by physician-scientists and new, discovery-based findings of
fundamental disease mechanisms in basic research labs to be effectively translated to the clinic. This
application seeks to support 4 trainees each year over the funding period. Fellows will be selected from
MD, DO, MD/PhD, or PhD trainees who hold strong interests in pediatric cardiopulmonary research and
are committed to careers in disease-oriented investigation. The Program Directors have strong records in
basic, translational, and clinical cardiopulmonary research and mentoring, and will serve as the training
program leaders. The training plan consists of laboratory and clinical research training supplemented by
courses, seminars, conferences, and exposure to industry relationships and non-traditional career
pathways. Each trainee will perform independent research under the direction of a mentor according to an
individualized mentoring program. The research areas encompassed by the 27 mentors, including 6
Mentors-in-Training, are represented by their affiliations at the Abigail Wexner Research Institute at NCH
and The Ohio State University. An aggressive underrepresented minority recruitment and retention plan is
described to increase trainee diversity, and is a critical aspect of this program, which aligns with NCH and
OSU strategic priorities. A comprehensive trainee and mentor evaluation system, an integral component
of the training program, is also included. Overall metrics to determine success include programmatic
review by internal and external advisory committees and the successful execution of each trainee’s
individual mentoring program. Trainee-specific metrics include required coursework, mentoring team
evaluations, and research productivity as measured by publications, presentations, and grants."
10903971,"Summary Statement
An evolving extracellular mechanical landscape accompanies the progression of multiple diseases including
cancer, pulmonary fibrosis, and hypertension. While the influence of stiffening tissue on gene expression, cell
migration, and phenotype is well established, how these changes affect delivery of nanoparticle therapeutics is
less well understood, especially for materials that experience dynamic force (e.g., stretch). Conventional in vitro
nanoparticle discovery models use plastics that do not have mechanical properties reflecting tissue. These
models limit the effectiveness of conventional screening processes. Therefore, my research program will
examine how dynamic forces impact nanoparticle uptake and fate and apply this information to design more
efficient nanoparticles for cellular entry. Specifically, we will focus on lung epithelial tissue and vascular
endothelium, two tissues with important delivery routes for nanotherapeutics. In support of this goal, research
theme 1 will examine how substrate mechanics modulate the nanoparticle uptake pathway of cells. Nearly all
nanoparticles enter through endocytosis. However, the productivity of different endocytosis routes can vary,
especially when stiffness and dynamic forces are included. Our goal is to identify and understand how
mechanically-linked regulatory processes direct nanoparticles to different uptake pathways. To achieve this goal,
we will utilize tissue models that include 2D and 3D stretches that are observed in
physiological/pathophysiological tissue environments. Theme 2 focuses on understanding how cell surface
structures, particularly the glycocalyx, change when cells experience different forces. Identifying key changes in
glycocalyx structures will present potential routes for targeting specific cells based on the underlying
dysfunctional physical environment. These models will be combined with liposomal nanoparticle designs that
facilitate delivery to target cells within complex cell environments. Taken together, this research program will
allow us to reimagine cellular targeting by factoring in the mechanical characteristics of cells and multicellular
interactions to redesign NP formulations with enhanced efficacy, safety, and control."

Responding to community concerns related to higher cancer incidences and worse outcomes among New
Mexico’s ethnically and racially diverse communities, the University of New Mexico (UNM) Continuing Umbrella
of Research Experiences (CURE) for Cancer program was inaugurated in 2015. Since then the program has
trained 45 high school (85% AI, any race) and 47 undergraduate students (51% AI, 32% Hispanic, any race)
who have continued/completed their education through pursuit of college, and advanced degree programs, and
are entering the scientific and health professions workforce. Cancer and inflammation associated chronic
diseases (type 2 diabetes and obesity) represent disproportionate causes of morbidity and mortality among New
Mexico’s populations; including people with limited economic resources, and rural residents. In response to the
NCI R25 Youth Enjoy Science program call for developing a diverse biomedical workforce, the CURE for Cancer
program builds on well-established experiential cancer-focused summer research internships and curricula that
advance knowledge of current and emerging cancer innovations and career paths. Relevant role models and
peer-networks that value cultural identity while building science identity is shown to promote persistence. The
CURE for Cancer program has established networks to allow statewide and national recruitment and training of
American Indian, Hispanic and other underrepresented students. Thus, the CURE for Cancer program is
uniquely poised to increase the representation of American Indians and Hispanics in the sciences and address
a pressing national challenge to reduce the higher prevalence of cancer among these populations. The CURE
for Cancer Program Specific Aims synergize with the overarching goals of the University of New Mexico
Comprehensive Cancer Center and will: 1) Increase participation and persistence of students underrepresented
in cancer research from the high school to the undergraduate levels through targeted recruitment, inter-
programmatic connectivity, tracking and formal evaluation, 2) Encourage cancer career pursuit through
specialized curricula, clinical exposure, and immersive research programs for high school and undergraduate
students and 3) Engage New Mexico's rural and underserved Hispanic and tribal communities in science and
health education through a Cancer-STEM Pathways Conference for middle school students and engaged youth
ambassadors. Annual evaluation, student tracking and regular review by an Advisory Committee, will assess
student benefit and program impact. The successful completion of these aims is expected to increase the
likelihood that underrepresented populations will proceed to and graduate from college, attend
graduate/professional school or work in cancer related professions. Moreover, what makes UNM CURE unique
is its coupling of culturally relevant pedagogy with cutting edge cancer research training that is integrated with
Hispanic and Native American community needs."
10890057,"ABSTRACT
Mitochondrial dysfunction, including bioenergetics dysregulation, has been broadly described under cellular stress
conditions, such as those found in many human diseases. However, the exact mechanisms that drive mitochondria to
dysfunction and failure under these conditions are still too poorly understood to enable effective therapeutic targeting.
Inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) is a ubiquitous molecule, even if it shows a preferred location within mitochondria. It is
extremely well-conserved throughout evolution, and it is present in every studied organism. The bonds of polyP are
isoenergetic to those found in ATP, and we and others have already demonstrated that polyP is a key energy metabolite
(scientific premise for this proposal). Moroever, the key role played by polyP in maintaining cellular homeostasis under
stress conditions in some organisms, such as bacteria and yeast, is already known. This is also the case for polyP’s
involvement in the regulation of some crucial mitochondrial processes which are i) closely related to the bioenergetic
status of mammalian cells, and ii) involved in the stress response. These processes include, the regulation of
mitochondrial calcium homeostasis and the formation and opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore.
Nonetheless, the exact extent of the effects of polyP in mammalian cellular, and more specifically, mitochondrial
physiology; as well as the molecular mechanism underlying these effects still remain mostly unknown. This molecular
mechanism could involve the regulation of the inositol multikinase (IPMK)/AMPK-Activated protein kinase (AMPK)
axis, which will place polyP as a signaling molecule in mammalian bioenergetics. The objective of this project is to
elucidate the mechanistic role of mitochondrial polyP in mitochondrial physiology and cellular bioenergetics, under basal
and disease-relevant stress conditions. To accomplish this objective, based on the bibliography and our preliminary data,
our global hypothesis is that: mammalian mitochondrial polyP is a key regulator of cellular bioenergetics and
mitochondrial physiology under disease-relevant acute stress conditions. The effects of polyP on mitochondrial
physiology are also exerted via the regulation of the IPMK/AMPK axis. To test this hypothesis, we will use mammalian
cellular models in which the levels of mitochondrial polyP will be modified, and a combination of biochemical, cell
biology, molecular biology, and -omics techniques. We will first optimize the methods to assay mammalian polyP (this is
a crucial component of the innovation of this proposal). Subsequently, we will study the plausible regulatory effects of
polyP on cellular bioenergetics and mitochondrial physiology, as well as polyP’s role in bioenergetics signaling, via the
regulation of the IPMK/AMPK axis. This application aligns with the PI’s and laboratory’s expertise in mitochondrial
polyP and bioenergetics, accelerating the progress of their research. Moreover, it is in line with the long-term goal of the
PI on this application, which is to unravel the mechanisms that drive mitochondrial to dysfunction and failure in human
disease. The obtained data will not only increase our knowledge of mitochondrial physiology, it will also help us to
propose polyP as a new and promising potential pharmacological tool for various pathological conditions where the
dysregulation of bioenergetics has been described (significance)."

The goal of CBT@EmTech is to develop an innovative graduate program to train the next generation of
cardiovascular leaders at the intersection of cardiovascular biomechanics, mechanobiology, medical imaging,
computational modeling, medical devices, therapeutics discovery and delivery, and data science to address
translationally relevant cardiovascular biomechanics, pathophysiology, therapies, and diagnostics. The Program
is built on a long history of ground-breaking research applying biomechanics to the field of cardiovascular disease
at Emory and Georgia Tech. The Program leverages our long-standing successes in research and education in
cardiovascular biomechanics and medicine across Emory and Georgia Tech. CBT@EmTech trainees will be
recruited from an applicant pool of >80 diverse groups of eligible students, including women and
underrepresented minorities from the Joint Department of Biomedical Engineering (BME) at Georgia Tech and
Emory and the Interdisciplinary Bioengineering (BioE) Graduate Program at Georgia Tech. BioE graduate
students come from various home Departments, including Electrical and Computer and Mechanical Engineering
at Georgia Tech and Departments of Mathematics, Computer Science, and Chemistry at Emory. We request
support for six students per year over five years to provide two years of support for each student in years 1 and
2 of their PhD program. In addition to the T32-supported positions, two additional students per year will be
supported, one by Emory and the other by Georgia Tech, to help further train a diverse group of students. All the
trainees will do lab rotations in the first year to select a mentor and co-mentor, one from medicine/biology and
the other in engineering/data science, or vice versa, or one from biology/engineering/data science and the other
from medicine. This will train and encourage our students to undertake multidisciplinary, collaborative, and
translational research. Our trainees will take 1) foundational courses in biosciences, engineering, and data
science, 2) integrative biomedical engineering courses, 3) ethics and diversity training, 4) communication and
professional development, and 5) the Advanced Seminars in Cardiovascular Biomechanics and Medicine class
that include clinical observations. CBT@EmTech will enhance the diversity of the workforce in the cardiovascular
biomechanics and disease field and train them to be inclusive leaders. Our trainees from diverse backgrounds
are expected to become leaders in addressing unmet translational and clinical needs in cardiovascular
biomechanics, pathophysiology, therapies, and diagnostics."
10891600,"SUMMARY
In tissues, immune cells are well-organized spatially and perform specific functions to dictate tissue homeostasis
and inflammation. Yet, it is rarely understood how the organization and functions of immune cells are regulated
by their surrounding tissue stroma. The overall vision of the lab is to elucidate the impacts and mechanisms of
the interactions between immune and non-immune cell types, in order to understand general principles of how
immune functions are regulated within tissues. This may ultimately lead us to program immune responses to
restore tissue homeostasis from disease. The lab has discovered that macrophages and fibroblasts, two cell
types that are commonly present in mammalian tissues, self-assemble into a tissue-like system that maintains a
stable and robust population composition. These homeostatic features rely on paracrine communication of
growth factors and direct contact between these cells. This macrophage-fibroblast system provides a unique,
accessible and modular platform to discover immune functions in the cellular context of stromal cells and to
dissect the underlying mechanisms. Our published and preliminary data formulate the overall hypothesis of the
lab: distinct cellular responses emerge from the interactions between macrophages and fibroblasts.
The goal of the lab in the next five years is to identify the cellular and molecular bases of the interactions between
macrophages and fibroblasts and to characterize how these interactions regulate immune responses during
tissue homeostasis or inflammation. We aim to elucidate general principles that regulate functions and
organization of immune cells in tissues, by developing new methods to study their interactions and interactive
partners, discovering interaction receptors to perturb them, and defining cellular functions dependent on such
interactions. To reach this goal, 3 directions will be pursued in my lab: 1) develop fucosyl-labeling, a new cell-
based chemical genetic approach, to identify cell-cell interactions, 2) identify molecules responsible for the
physical association between macrophages and fibroblasts, leveraging candidate-based genetic approaches, 3)
determine how the interactions between macrophages and fibroblasts impact their cellular responses under
inflammatory conditions using transcriptome profiling, imaging and immunological assays. Research proposed
in this application is innovative because it presents a comprehensive strategy to directly tackle the mechanistic
nature of immune-stromal interactions, combined with exploration of a new research paradigm and the
development of cutting-edge technologies that will have a fundamental impact in basic cell biology and
immunology.
The proposed research is significant because it will identify the cellular mechanisms that regulate
immune functions critical for maintaining tissue homeostasis and regulating inflammatory responses. My lab will
advance our knowledge of inter-cellular processes that may lead to inflammatory disorders and define new
possible therapeutic targets. The reagents, tools and experimental systems developed here will benefit the broad
scientific community to explore multi-cellular interactions."

Sepsis is a common condition with significant morbidity, mortality, and annual costs-of-care in the billions of
dollars. Despite innumerable studies on the causes of, and therapies for, sepsis, the mortality rate has not
changed substantially in the last 20 years. Treatments remain generic, with current guidelines recommending
the same approach for all patients, regardless of the obvious litany of differences that exist at baseline.
Moreover, the blanket administration of 30cc/kg of intravenous fluid (IVF) to all patients is recognized as being
directly harmful to some. Patient-level heterogeneity in prior sepsis trials is recognized as a substantial
contributor to all of these problems, yet no prior investigation has attempted to identify septic phenotypes, a
necessary first step towards precision care. This project will address these critical knowledge gaps by
systematically characterizing profiles of patients with sepsis using a combination of sonographic and biomarker
variables. This will begin at the time of presentation to the Emergency Department and continue at specified
time points during hospitalization, thereby creating a rich longitudinal database from which identification of
unique phenotypes will be possible. Our central hypothesis is that central venous hypertension: (i) is
deleterious to the function of the lungs, liver kidneys, and vascular endothelium; (ii) is worsened by cardiac
dysfunction and IVF administration; and (iii), contributes to adverse organ-specific and overall outcomes.
Cardiac function will be assessed with echocardiography while congestion in the lungs, and kidneys will be
assessed using previously validated sonographic markers of congestion. Biomarkers for each organ will be
collected concurrently thereby increasing the fidelity of our phenotypic profiles by pairing indicators of macro-
and microscopic stress and dysfunction. Classical and machine learning approaches will be used to analyze
our large data-stream and develop a rule-based system to identify distinct sub-populations of sepsis patients
who have greater risk/likelihood of both organ-specific and overall adverse outcomes. Completion of the
project will result in generation of the first comprehensive description of septic phenotypes at the level of
individual organs and the organismal level, including the effects of resuscitative interventions. The combination
of longitudinal imaging and laboratory data is novel and offers potential short-term (outcome-based guidance of
IVF administration and prognosis via sonographic data) and long-term (development of biomarker panels and
targeted therapeutics) patient-oriented benefits."

Defective mitochondrial function causes cellular damage and death under stress conditions. At the organismal
level mitochondrial dysfunction occurs in mitochondrial diseases caused by genetic mutations,
neurodegeneration, and with less severity during aging, damaging vulnerable tissues such as brain and skeletal
muscle. Mitochondrial mutations cause failures that disrupt energy metabolism, including reductive/oxidative
imbalances and inflammation that lead to tissue damage and eventually death. Mitochondrial defective cells
depend on glycolysis for energy generation and, similar to mitochondrial disease patients, are vulnerable to
stress conditions. The mechanisms that cause this cell damage and how mitochondrial defective cells can be
protected against damage and death are largely unknown. This is important because there are no cures for
mitochondrial diseases, and dysfunctional mitochondria is one of the hallmarks of aging or neurodegeneration.
In genetic and chemical high throughput screens our laboratory has identified a subset of antibiotics, including
tetracyclines, that target the mitoribosome protein translation, and rescue cell death and inflammation in cellular
and mouse models of mitochondrial diseases. Tetracyclines-promoted cell survival depends on suppression of
ER stress and Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) that is independent of the transcription factor ATF4. The
mechanisms of how tetracycline-induced mitoribosome stalling/splitting protect against cell death in cellular and
mouse pre-clinical models of mitochondrial diseases is unknown. We hypothesize that a signaling mechanism
initiated at the stalled/split mitoribosome promotes cell survival in the context of mitochondrial defective cells and
human disease mutations. The main goal of this application is to identify the signaling and cellular
mechanisms caused by stalled and split mitoribosomes that promote cell survival and determine the
efficacy in cellular and mouse models of mitochondrial diseases. We propose 1) to determine the initial
signaling mechanism at the partial stalled/split mitoribosome that promotes survival in mitochondrial disease
mutant cells, focusing on MALSU splitting factor and additional proteins associated at the mitoribosome; 2) to
analyze the components downstream of the stalled/split mitoribosome that promote survival in mitochondrial
disease mutant cells, focusing on components that link the stalled/split mitoribosome to ER stress IRE1a and
UPR responses and 3) to analyze the effects of tetracycline analogs in Ndufs4 KO mice, a mitochondrial complex
I deficient mouse model, focusing on the effects tetracyclines on fitness, survival and modulation of mitoribosome
signaling/ER stress and suppression of brain and skeletal muscle immune inflammation in Ndufs4 KO mice. The
outcomes of this application will determine the regulatory and signaling mechanisms that are initiated by the
stalled/split mitoribosome in conditions of defective mitochondrial disease mutations. These mechanisms will
advance our understanding of mitoribosome protein translation and signaling mechanisms that protect cell
damage in the context of mitochondrial dysregulation and diseases."

This proposal is a request for continued funding of an institutional pre- and postdoctoral NRSA Training
Program in Immunology and Molecular Pathogenesis at the medical school of Northwestern University which
has been funded since 1996. Predoctoral training will be done in conjunction with the Driskill Graduate
Program (DGP). The DGP will be the mechanism for recruitment of a pool of highly qualified graduate students
from which candidates will be selected. The training program is also supported by the Northwestern Office for
Postdoctoral Affairs and Immunobiology Center. The training program, unique among the training programs at
Northwestern, will stress the basic mechanisms and interactive nature of immunology, microbiology, and
pathogenesis and the collaboration of colleagues. The program includes 40 highly productive researchers
experienced in pre- and postdoctoral training who collectively hold >30 million dollars per year in research
funding and who can impart both basic and clinical perspectives to a group of outstanding trainees. The result
will be a more productive research environment, both for the pre- and postdoctoral students and for the many
projects funded by grants from the NIH and other federal and private agencies. A major research-in-progress
event, IMP Day, will highlight before the entire community the accomplishments of the trainees. Feedback
received at this event will be another way of enhancing the experience of our trainees. The training grant also
proposes to foster trainee interactions with scientists at other institutions through trainee travel to national
meetings (to present their research and to develop contacts) and through visits of prominent scientists to
Northwestern as trainee-invited speakers. The training program also serves to focus the activities at the
University aimed at educating students in the ethics of science and at recruiting underrepresented minorities to
studies in immunology, microbiology, and molecular pathogenesis. There will be continuous evaluation of the
program using multiple mechanisms, including evaluations by the trainees, the tracking of the productivity,
funding support, and career development of former trainees, and Internal Training Grants Directors'
Committee, and an External Advisory Committee that consists of leaders from outside the institution. The
program requests maintaining the current four predoctoral and two postdoctoral slots. Predoctoral students will
be appointed for a 2-year period at the end of the second year of graduate studies after they have completed
their coursework and qualifying exams and have identified a research advisor, while postdoctoral candidates
will be appointed at the outset of their training for a 1-year period while they apply for independent funding.
Refunding of the program will give training in immunology, microbiology, and molecular pathogenesis at
Northwestern the continuity required to maintain the momentum gained during the previous funding periods
and will allow the continued supply of highly trained young investigators with primary interests in the basic
mechanisms of host-parasite interactions and immune regulatory functions governing disease processes."

10904901,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Lymphedema is a major complication after radiation and/or surgery for breast and gynecological cancers.
Advancements in surgical techniques mitigate the risk, but the incidence of lymphedema is still high, and there
are no approved medications to prevent or treat it. Doxorubicin (DOX) is a central chemotherapy drug for treating
breast and gynecological cancers, but it increases the risk of lymphedema by 3-fold. The mechanism by which
DOX contributes to chronic lymphedema is unknown, but we found that clinically relevant concentrations of DOX
acutely inhibit lymph vessel (LV) contractions and reduce lymph flow by activating ryanodine receptors (RYRs,
intracellular calcium channels) in lymph muscle cells (LMCs), resulting in tonic Ca2+ leak from the sarcoplasmic
reticulum (SR) and lymphostasis. Sustained high levels of cytosolic Ca2+ [Ca2+i] can promote lipid peroxidation
and cell death pathways, and the increase in intraluminal pressure produced by lymphostasis can damage LV
walls and valve leaflets, synergistically causing chronic lymphatic injury. It is unclear whether DOX activates
RYRs through a direct interaction or indirectly by mediating the oxidation of RYRs. Indeed, DOX elevates both
cytosolic and mitochondrial superoxide (O2•-), which could contribute to RYR oxidation (receptor opening) and
subsequent Ca2+ leak. It is also unknown which RYR subtype (RYR1, RYR2, RYR3) is activated by DOX in
LMCs; if known, it could serve as a potential therapeutic target to prevent DOX-induced lymphatic dysfunction.
We propose RYRs are novel therapeutic targets in LMCs to prevent DOX-induced lymphatic dysfunction and the
development of chronic lymphedema. We hypothesize that DOX generates O2•- to acutely oxidize and open
RYRs to increase [Ca2+i] in LMCs, inhibiting LV contractions and inducing lymphostasis and lymphatic injury, and
added surgical insult potentiates this effect. Accordingly, we will use our well-established rat model to evaluate
RYRs as therapeutic targets to prevent DOX-induced lymphatic dysfunction. Three aims will integrate techniques
in preclinical studies to explore this hypothesis and will rely on protein and functional analysis of isolated LVs,
use optical imaging to assess volumetric lymph flow in vivo in response to DOX and RYR blockade, and
investigate the utility of RYR blockers, as a potential therapeutics in a preclinical model of lymphatic
insufficiency. Aim 1 will determine whether DOX-induced RYR activation is mediated by O2•- in LMCs. Aim 2 will
define the role of RYR subtypes in DOX-induced Ca2+ leak in isolated LVs and in lymph flow in vivo. Aim 3 will
investigate the combined impact of DOX ± RYR blocker on lymphatic function, lipid peroxidation, and lymphatic
morphology in a preclinical rat model of lymphatic insufficiency. Thus, we plan to explore RYRs as novel
therapeutic targets to prevent DOX-related lymphedema and evaluate whether RYR blockers can be utilized as
anti-lymphedema agents."

Children with developmental language disorder (DLD) demonstrate language deficits in
comparison to unaffected peers from similar language-learning environments. Because of the
diversity in children’s language-learning environments, the linguistic characteristics of DLD
differ across children. However, affected children may share common underlying deficits in
cognitive processing skills such as processing speed, working memory, and sustained selective
attention. This project systematically examines the cognitive processing profiles of individual
children with DLD from different language-learning environments to identify common patterns
of deficit and utilize them to identify DLD. We include children aged 5- to 7-years from three
different language groups (English only, Spanish-English, and Vietnamese-English); within each
of these three groups, both children with typical development (n = 60 per group; n = 180 total)
and children with DLD (n = 20 per group; n = 60 total) are represented. Participants will
complete assessments of processing speed, working memory, and sustained selective attention
in the visual and auditory modalities using nonlinguistic stimuli to avoid bias based on linguistic
experience (for bilingual children) or linguistic deficits (for children with DLD). The project will
establish the reliability and validity of each assessment task to ensure suitability for clinical use
(Aim 1). Cluster analyses will determine common profiles of cognitive processing skill and
whether these profiles differ for children with and without DLD (Aim 2). Diagnostic accuracy
analyses will be conducted to determine whether nonlinguistic cognitive processing tasks can
identify children with DLD within a diverse group of language learners (Aim 3). This project will
advance understanding of the underlying cognitive mechanisms that contribute to DLD by
examining commonalities across children learning language in diverse circumstances. It will
also establish a novel and universal approach to DLD identification that will reduce disparities
across children."

 Deformities created by birth defects, trauma, inflammation, and medical conditions including cancer
constitute a significant global health burden accounting for 11% of worldwide disability-adjusted life years and
can be corrected by reconstructive surgery. Standard reconstructive techniques include autologous, pedicled
or vascularized tissue flaps to replace moderate to severe composite tissue defects. Limitation of these
methods include donor-site morbidity and difficulty in shaping the graft to restore complex three-dimensional
anatomy. In the case of fasciocutaneous flaps, both factors are limiting – and a significant portion of such
defects cannot be treated with current techniques. In the longer term, Vascularized composite allografts
(VCAs) have potential to revolutionize the treatment of complex soft tissue absence by providing an
anatomically exact tissue unit enabling like-for-like restoration, but is impractical as long as the recipient
requires toxic immunosuppression which limited the number of VCA transplants to about 150 over the last 2
decades.
 Our long-term goal is to engineer vascular composite allografts using patient specific cells for repairing
composite tissue defects. The goal of this project is to develop a novel protocol for creating fasciocutaneous
flaps (FCF) that are vascularized and blood compatible, which would provide a straightforward path to treating
some currently unfixable defects clinically in the short-term, while laying the groundwork for building more
complex tissues in the long term. The rationale of the study is that while most past biomaterials research has
focused on producing the ideal scaffold from the ground up using synthetic materials, the native extracellular
matrix (ECM), de facto contains much of necessary architecture and environmental cues absent from synthetic
matrices, and hence presents a promising, more realistic alternative approach for producing engineered tissue
substitutes, which can vertically advance the field of tissue engineering."

Multicellular organisms face constant mutational pressures due to DNA damage and errors in cell
division. New mutations continually accumulate throughout development and can result in cancer,
aging, and infertility. With the increased sensitivity to detect mutations by deep sequencing, it has
become clear that even healthy individuals are genetically heterogeneous and carry numerous post-
zygotic mutations in both their somatic and germinal cells. This proposal aims to understand how
organisms cope with ongoing mutation during development, focusing on maize and Arabidopsis. First,
we will investigate the accumulation of mutations in different tissues throughout the life cycle. To follow
new mutations, we focus on transposons as it is possible to quantify rare, recent mutations with high
sensitivity. We hypothesize that development is organized in a way that maintains the diversity of the
meristem stem cell niche, avoiding population bottlenecks in critical reservoir cells and thus preventing
any single somatic mutation from reaching fixation across the organism. We will test whether plants
with altered growth patterns and meristem defects accumulate new mutations more frequently
because they are unable to maintain stem cell diversity. Second, we will investigate chromosomal
regulation in the soma and germline during maize pollen development. Each grain of pollen is a simple
3-celled organism, with a single somatic cell and two germ cells. We will study the activation of the
haploid pollen genome and then determine how epigenetic marks that differentiate soma and germline
are established and maintained. Genome changes will be followed using single-cell RNA-seq,
chromatin profiling, and microscopy. We will identify genes that regulate this process using a novel
strategy to perform genetic screens directly in haploid pollen, allowing millions of mutations to be
assayed per plant. Ultimately, this work will shed insight into how organisms regulate multicellular
development and chromosomal structure to reduce the impact of new mutations."
10702032,"It is estimated that traumatic brain injury (TBI) accounts for over 2 million emergency department visits per
year, and nearly 300,000 require hospitalization and treatment (CDC data). Those who serve in the military are
at significant risk for TBI, with 414,000 cases reported among US service members between 2010-2019.
Consequences of TBI are often severe, including suffering for the victim, lost productivity, and burden on public
health systems, with the costs of hospitalization and rehabilitation growing, as well as current inadequate
treatments. Unfortunately, many patients develop lifelong neurological deficits. As the understanding of the
pathomechanism of TBI increases, attractive therapeutic targets are identified. Hence, there is hope of
developing new therapeutic strategies that could be implemented early to halt the ongoing cascade of damage
and at later stages, afford repair of brain damage.
 Pathomechanism of TBI is complex with multiple factors contributing to neurological deficits. TBI
triggers a strong and immediate inflammatory insult, with so-called “danger signals” or danger-associated
molecular patterns (DAMPs) being potent activators of local immune responses, mediating secondary brain
damage - especially adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and its receptor, P2X purinoceptor 7 (P2X7), whose
blocking has been studied with some success. However, following systemic administration, accumulation of
these macromolecules in the brain is hugely ineffective. Over the last two decades, our research has focused
on improving brain targeting with intra-arterial route being the most effective - as it facilitates minimally invasive
administration of high concentrations of drugs with immediate access within the entire lesion. Indeed, we
confirmed experimentally that even during acute stage after TBI intraarterial targeting of brain lesion is feasible.
This approach is ideal to address the needs of preventing TBI damages in the acute phase. As for the chronic
effects of TBI, recent studies focusing on war Veterans with TBI have revealed a preponderance of white
matter abnormalities.
 Our group has worked extensively with glial restricted progenitor (GRP) cells; and we demonstrated
quite spectacular therapeutic effects following transplantation in dysmyelinated mice. We have shown that
intra-arterially delivered GRPs can cross the blood-brain barrier; and thus, serve as a carrier for the local
production of neuroinflammation-blocking nanobodies in brain parenchyma. Here we propose the “block-and-
repair” therapy to address both the acute phase inflammation and the chronic phase white matter damage after
TBI. In this strategy, GRPs will be bioengineered with mRNA encoding a potent P2X7 nanobody to be
secreted in situ to block inflammation, and GRPs will mature to repair white matter injury after TBI. To improve
brain targeting for immediate effect, we will inject the cells using our established image-guided intra-arterial
technique. Our previous work showed functional improvement after TBI by depletion of microglia. In this
proposal, we will explore if there is any additive effect with combined microglial depletion and P2X7nb-mRNA-
GRPs. Overall, we propose an innovative cell-based strategy that addresses both acute and chronic
pathomechnisms following TBI. If our project demonstrates safety and efficacy of this approach, it could be
rapidly implemented into clinical practice- potentially impacting the treatment of TBI."
10926866,"ABSTRACT – PROJECT 2
 Inhibitors of the DNA repair enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) are highly active in homol-
ogous recombination (HR)-deficient ovarian cancers, especially those with BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) muta-
tions. Even in this setting, however, 40-80% of cases become PARP inhibitor (PARPi) resistant, most often as
a result of genetic or biochemical changes that restore HR. Among other genomic subsets of ovarian cancer,
PARPi resistance is even more prevalent. The observation that most common mechanisms of acquired PARPi
resistance do not result from a failure to inhibit PARP1 raises the possibility that PARPis can potentially be
utilized as chemosensitizing agents in this setting if suitable combinations can be identified. Accordingly, the
present project seeks to enhance the efficacy of the PARPi rucaparib and extend its use by combining it with a
3rd generation topoisomerase I (TOP1) inhibitor (TOP1i). Recent studies have shown that nanoparticle
formulations such as PLX038, a polyethylene glycol-conjugated ultra-long acting form of the TOP1i 7-ethyl-10-
hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38), exhibit less marrow toxicity and greater efficacy than conventional TOP1is in
preclinical cancer models. Our preliminary studies show that sustained release TOP1is, including PLX038, are
active against five of seven PARPi-resistant ovarian cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) tested. Moreover,
using a unique antibody that detects TOP1-DNA covalent complexes (TOP1ccs), which are intermediates in the
TOP1i-induced killing process, we have shown that TOP1ccs are diminished or undetectable in PDXs that are
resistant to the TOP1i/PARPi combination, providing a starting point for understanding ovarian cancer resistance
to this treatment. Collectively, these results lead to the hypothesis that a readily identifiable subset of HR-
proficient ovarian cancers will exhibit sustained antitumor effects when treated with a next generation
TOP1i alone or in combination with a PARPi. To test this hypothesis, we now propose to i) assess the efficacy
of PLX038, alone and in combination with the PARPi rucaparib, in a cohort of genomically profiled high grade
serous ovarian cancer PDXs with intrinsic or acquired resistance to single agent PARPis to identify the spectrum
of ovarian cancers that could potentially benefit from PLX038 or the combination; ii) identify mechanisms of
resistance to the TOP1i/PARPi combination in PDXs and cell lines; and iii) examine the association between the
formation of drug-stabilized TOP1-DNA covalent complexes in tumor cells and the response of ovarian cancer
patients to the PLX038/rucaparib combination in a phase II clinical trial. Collectively, these studies will not only
provide insight into the genomic and biochemical factors that affect response to a 3rd generation TOP1i in ovarian
cancer, but also determine whether it is possible to use PARPis as chemosensitizing agents in settings where
they are no longer active as single agents. If successful, this project will point to a new therapy for the growing
number of women with PARPi-resistant ovarian cancer."
10926870,"ABSTRACT – PROJECT 3
The 5-year survival for advanced high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is <30%. The introduction of
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPis) has increased progression-free survival in patients
and may increase overall survival in some patients; however, the emergence of PARPi-resistant disease is an
escalating clinical problem. Accordingly, there is a pressing need to identify novel therapies that enhance PARPi
activity in HGSOC. Here we show that ceritinib, a small molecule kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of
ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer, synergizes with PARPis. This synergy is not due to ceritinib-induced
disruption of homologous recombination (HR) or ALK inhibition. Instead, ceritinib synergizes with PARPis, at
least in part, by inhibiting mitochondrial respiration, which induces the production of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) and consequent induction of DNA damage that is repaired via the PARP-dependent base excision report
(BER) pathway. Consistent with this mechanism of action, we show that a ceritinib + PARPi combination is
synergistic in HR-proficient and -deficient ovarian cancer cell lines. Moreover, in HGSOC patient-derived
xenograft (PDX) models, ceritinib + olaparib (C+O) induces tumor regressions and extends mouse survival more
effectively than olaparib alone. These observations raise the possibility that C+O will extend progression-free
survival or prevent the emergence of PARPi resistance in HGSOC. Despite this progress, it remains unclear
i) whether C+O can be safely given to patients, ii) whether C+O has activity against HGSOC in patients, and
iii) how to identify the ovarian cancers that will be most responsive to C+O. To begin the process of repurposing
ceritinib for ovarian cancer, we propose to i) perform a phase Ib trial of C+O with an expansion cohort and
correlative studies in platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer; ii) identify genes and pathways, including DNA
repair pathways, that affect C+O cytotoxicity in order to provide additional insight into the action of this
combination and potentially identify biomarkers of response; and iii) use PDX models to assess potential
genotypic and phenotypic differences that correlate with antitumor responses to C+O. The overarching goals of
these studies are to better understand the mechanism(s) of action of the C+O combination and identify ovarian
cancers most likely to respond to this combination in a future phase II trial in HGSOC. These studies, which
utilize the Biospecimens, Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, and Animal Models Cores, are designed to facilitate
the repurposing of ceritinib in combination with PARPis as a new therapy to improve the outcomes of PARPi-
treated HGSOC."
10926873,"ABSTRACT – PROJECT 4
Women diagnosed with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) have a median 5-year survival rate of ~20%,
and recurrent EOC remains essentially incurable. Novel immunotherapies, including immune checkpoint
blockade and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies have had some success, but response rates
have been typically below 20%. Similarly, the response rates to molecularly targeted therapies have been
limited, partly due to the lack of recurrently mutated targets and the high level of chromosomal instability
characteristic of EOC. Synthetic lethality via PARP inhibition and VEGF blockade have demonstrated some
benefit, but mechanisms of resistance have already surfaced for these new therapies. The long-term goal of
our research program is to develop highly effective immune cell-based therapies capable of eliminating
recurrent EOC. In Project 4, we will use advanced gene editing techniques that we have developed to produce
hyperfunctional Natural Killer (NK) cells for treating advanced EOC. We focus on NK cells because i) they do
not require antigen priming and ii) side effects, such as graft versus host disease and cytokine release
syndrome, are minimal compared to T cell therapy. We propose to make two fundamental alterations to human
NK cells obtained from healthy donors. The first genetic alteration removes an intracellular signaling protein
that dampens NK activation (the CISH gene) using a modified CRISPR/Cas9 protocol we have developed that
is highly effective in primary human NK cells. The second genetic alteration is to site-specifically integrate a
chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) gene that we have developed specifically for NK cells. This CAR NK targets
the mesothelin protein, a prevalent EOC tumor antigen. Our central hypothesis is that gene editing can be
used to overcome signaling inhibition and improve NK cell targeting, persistence and function, resulting in
improved therapeutic outcomes for women with advanced EOC. The work proposed in this project includes
generating and testing the gene edited NK cells for enhanced function by co-culturing with ovarian cancer cells
in vitro and testing in both cell line- and patient-derived xenograft models of EOC in vivo. The data from these
preclinical tests will be used to guide the design of the Phase I clinical trial using these gene-edited NK cells.
This project will determine whether gene-edited CAR NK cell immunotherapy in humans is safe and has the
potential to improve outcomes in the setting of recurrent EOC. In addition, what we learn from this study will
have the broader impact of potential future application to other malignancies, as the engineering techniques
can be quickly adapted to remove different negative regulators and to target other tumor antigens with NK-
specific CARs."

Preterm birth due to an ascending infection accounts for 25-40% of spontaneous preterm births. Disruptions in
the cervical epithelia that perturb its barrier and immune function is a risk factor for an ascending infection. Using
single cell transcriptomic and spatial approaches, epithelia subpopulations were identified in cervices from
nonpregnant mice and mice at gestation days 6, 12, 15, 18 and in labor. Unique to pregnancy was the expansion
of two populations of secretory goblet cells which produce a distinct mucus network and immune surveillance
factors. In the current proposal, we aim to identify the lineage of these secretory cells which express markers of
both squamous and columnar epithelia, and to define the progesterone and estrogen dependent gene regulatory
networks that regulate proliferation and differentiation of the two goblet subtypes. Using single cell datasets from
mice with epithelial barrier defects or mice with exposure to lipopolysaccharide to induce inflammation, we will
define perturbations in epithelial subtype functions that contribute to ascending infection risk. Finally, the
expression of olfactomedin 4, one immune surveillance factor upregulated in the goblet cells in pregnancy, will
be measured in cervico-vaginal fluid from women in each trimester of a term or preterm pregnancy to determine
its utility to monitor cervical epithelial cell health and risk of spontaneous preterm births."
10821431,"PROJECT SUMMARY
After injury, tendon function is often compromised due to poor healing and failure to regenerate native structure.
Due to limited treatment options, there is an unmet clinical need for effective therapies that promote tendon
healing and functional restoration. However, our incomplete understanding of tendon biology prevents the design
of therapeutics that activate regenerative pathways involved in tendon formation. In particular, two major
obstacles exist: (1) the critical regulators of tendon induction and differentiation are unknown and (2) the
regulators driving non-regenerative adult tendon healing have not been elucidated or overcome. While the
mouse is the gold standard model to study the biology of mammalian tendon development and healing, the
extent of its relevance to human is unclear. To address these questions, we established robust differentiation
protocols to derive tenocytes from mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem
cells (hiPSCs). Using these in vitro tendon differentiation models in combination with human and mouse
embryos, clinically relevant injury models, and multiomics approaches, we will determine transcriptional and
epigenetic regulation of tendon cell fate in the contexts of development and injury."
10772166,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
B cells are immunopathogenic drivers of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease
characterized by a large repertoire of autoantibodies targeting self-protein and nucleic acids. While B cell-
directed T-cell therapies have curative potential in the treatment of B-cell cancers and can achieve complete
disease remission in refractory lupus, therapies that deplete all B cells are associated with excess morbidity and
mortality from infection, precluding their use beyond life-threatening disease. Precision therapies that selectively
target autoreactive B cells that drive SLE, while preserving normal B cell populations, are therefore critically
needed, but targeting the plethora of autoreactive B cells in SLE poses practical challenges. The autoreactive B
cell compartment in SLE is uniquely characterized by the expansion B cells bearing B-cell receptors (BCRs)
using the variable heavy-chain allele VH4-34, which encodes the idiotype 9G4 (9G4id B cells). 9G4id B cells
contribute 10–45% of total IgG in patients with active SLE, including antibodies against canonical lupus
autoantigens. 9G4id B cells are therefore promising targets for the selective depletion of the autoreactive B cell
pool, opening opportunities to treat lupus without increasing the risk of infection. Here, we hypothesize that
autologous T cells can be redirected to selectively bind and kill 9G4id B cells expanded in SLE. To achieve this,
we will develop 9G4id-targeted bispecific T cell-engaging antibodies designed to cross-link 9G4id B cells with any
T cell, thereby inducing killing of target B cells. In this proposal, we will graft single chain variable fragments of
an anti-9G4id-specific antibody and those of well-characterized CD3-specific antibodies (i.e., OKT3, UCHT1v9)
into different therapeutic bispecific formats (i.e., BiTE and scDb). The efficacy and specificity of anti-9G4
bispecific antibodies to selectively bind and deplete 9G4id B cells will be established in fully-controlled in vitro
model systems using engineered human B cell lines expressing 9G4id autoreactive BCRs cloned from patients
with SLE, human B cell lines expressing monoclonal non-9G4id BCRs, and using autologous B cells and T cells
isolated from the peripheral blood of patients with SLE. The final goal of this work is to lay the foundation for
evaluating these precision immunotherapies as a novel therapeutic strategy in SLE."
10807069,"Summary
Conventional ɑβ T cell receptor (TCR) recognition of a cognate peptide-Major Histocompatibility Complex
(pMHC) is central to adaptive immune recognition of pathogens and pathologically associated self-proteins.
Despite substantial progress in structural prediction of protein-protein interactions with tools such as AlphaFold
and RoseTTAFold, de novo prediction of TCR specificity (target pMHC) from TCR sequence has not yet been
realized. Indeed, within the largest databases of curated TCR specificities, only ~105 unique TCR:pMHC
assignments have been curated, and these are focused on <100 unique pMHC epitopes. In our previous work,
we established that >200 unique receptors recognizing the same epitope are required to confidently predict
whether a previously unobserved receptor belongs to the same specificity group. This work demonstrates that
once data are sufficiently dense, local prediction of specificity becomes feasible. It follows that the current
sparse nature of the available data is the major restriction to advancing the field. Thus, our central
hypothesis is that advancing predictive models for TCR specificity requires a dramatic increase in the
magnitude and diversity of curated TCR-pMHC data, which in turn requires new approaches for
generating such useful data sets. In three Aims, we will address major limitations of the current epitope
discovery and TCR characterization pipelines. In Aim 1, we will improve methods for relating single chain
TCR sequences to specific peptides for generating large libraries of well-curated TCRα or TCRβ associations
with individual epitopes. In addition to supporting our central goal, these data will have significant independent
utility for immune profiling and diagnostics. In Aim 2, we will establish methods for assigning paired chain
TCRɑβ data from single cell experiments to epitope pools, extending our recently reported reverse epitope
discovery pipeline. Aim 3 will integrate public data and the data generated in Aims 1 and 2, with novel
structural and computational approaches to generate improved de novo specificity prediction algorithms.
These Aims will be accomplished by accessing our collection of longitudinally sampled PBMCs from >4000
humans across well-curated cohorts from diverse ancestries and infection histories."
10891552,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Up to 5% of hospitalized adult patients on the medical-surgical wards develop clinical deterioration requiring
intensive care. Medical errors are common before deterioration events, including delays and misjudgments in
identification, diagnosis, and treatment, and these errors lead to increased morbidity and mortality. Therefore, it
is critically important to improve the care of high-risk ward patients to decrease preventable in-hospital deaths.
 The current paradigm for attempting to decrease mortality from deterioration has several limitations. First,
most early warning scores designed to identify high-risk patients are based only on vital signs and have limited
accuracy. Clinical notes are an underutilized, rich source of information comprising nearly 80% of electronic
health record (EHR) data. Natural language processing (NLP) can extract important risk factors from clinical
notes for machine learning models to improve accuracy over existing tools. Second, current early warning scores
only tell clinicians that a patient is at high risk but provide no information regarding what clinical condition is
causing a patient’s deterioration. This leads to diagnostic and treatment errors, which results in worse patient
outcomes. Developing tools to enhance diagnostic accuracy for high-risk ward patients could lead to fewer
medical errors, decreased costs, and improved outcomes. Third, the initial treatment decisions for deteriorating
patients are made by clinicians with limited experience caring for critically ill patients, which can result in delays
of potentially life-saving therapies. By utilizing a large, granular, multicenter dataset, algorithms to predict the
treatments a patient should receive can be developed, resulting in early, targeted, potentially life-saving therapy.
 The long-term goal is to develop and implement clinically useful decision support tools to decrease
preventable death from deterioration. The overall objective of this project is to develop a clinical decision support
tool for the identification, diagnosis, and treatment of patients at high risk of deterioration. This objective will be
pursued in the following three specific aims: 1) Develop machine learning models to identify patients at high risk
of deterioration using both structured data and unstructured clinical notes; 2) Develop models to predict the
diagnosis that is causing the deterioration event and the potentially life-saving treatments that should be provided
to high-risk patients; 3) Develop a clinical decision support tool with a graphical user interface incorporating the
models from Aims 1 and 2 via user-centered design principles and then test its effectiveness, efficiency, and
user satisfaction in a case-based simulation study. This research is innovative because it will utilize NLP,
reinforcement learning, interpretable machine learning, and multi-task transfer learning approaches. The
proposed research is significant because it will provide clinicians with powerful new tools that can be
implemented in the EHR to identify, diagnose, and make treatment recommendations for high-risk patients. This
will result in the delivery of early, personalized care to decrease preventable death from deterioration."
10932360,"SUMMARY / ABSTRACT - INVESTIGATOR DEVELOPMENT CORE
The RCMI Cancer and Health Disparities Research Center at Xavier University will continue the development of
an Investigator Development Core (IDC) that will focus on enhancing the biomedical and health disparities
research capacity of early-stage faculty. The IDC will achieve this goal by providing a pilot project program to
develop preliminary data or analyze existing data, along with multiple early career/research development
activities through a Research Development Network that will include matching of investigators with
collaborators and mentors and the introduction to multiple research resources. These activities will start as soon
as new faculty are hired, will continue during pilot project research, and remain as investigators move forward to
become research competitive. To accomplish these goals, the IDC will achieve the following two specific aims:
Specific Aim 1: To establish a pilot project program focused on early career investigators working in
collaboration with an established mentor and/or collaborator to develop research capacity and
competitiveness by generating preliminary data or analyzing existing data for submission of external
grant applications. The goal of this program is to support early-stage investigators to develop research projects
addressing diseases that disproportionately impact minorities or other disparity populations, or that otherwise
address health disparities. These pilot projects will be awarded on a competitive basis, may be funded for up to
two years of support and will generate preliminary data for the submission of peer reviewed publications and
external grant applications. The involvement of minority faculty will be emphasized and encouraged. This
program will require mentors/collaborators to be active participants in the pilot research process as well
as resulting publications and grant applications. The accomplishment of this aim will result in more early-stage
faculty at Xavier obtaining high quality preliminary data or performing significant analysis of existing data and
publications that will be incorporated into an increased number of competitive external grant applications being
submitted. Specific Aim 2. To coordinate and implement training and mentoring activities focused on
increasing the research competitiveness of early-stage investigators. The establishment of a Research
Development Network will link early-stage investigators to mentors and collaborators as well as the resources
of the Xavier RCMI program and other resources at Xavier and the region with the single goal of building strong
collaborative research projects that will be competitive for achieving external funding. A particular effort will be
made to develop minority faculty. Accomplishment of this aim will result in more early-stage investigators at
Xavier participating in mentored collaborations involving established researchers, more pilot applications, more
high-quality publications, more competitive applications for external grant funding and ultimately more research
awards, particularly those addressing health disparities issues."

management of human and other resources, to set priorities and to ensure that milestones are met in a timely
manner. The coordination of efforts from the three PIs, Hinman (CMU), Ettensohn (CMU), and Vize (Calgary)
brings complementary expertise to best achieve the goals of the project. External oversight and expertise is

respective components. Additionally the Admin Team of PI Hinman and Project Manager Telmer will schedule
meetings between subsets of PIs, all PIs, the Scientific Advisory Board, and with the echinoderm research
community PIs. This will ensure coordination of all subgoals in effectively meeting the overall goals for
Enhanced Echinobase."
10933432,"SUMMARY COMPUTATIONAL 1
Computational Support for all Echinobase Objectives
The goal of the Computation component is to keep Echinobase operational, reliable, and responsive, to
maintain and upgrade the hardware, cloud, infrastructure, software and systems necessary for peak
performance and to develop and support the proposed improvements described in other sections of this
application. Knowledgebases like Echinobase must integrate and process a diverse array of data and provide
users with tools and interfaces to query and explore its content. These are all computational processes. In
addition, Echinobase must interface with external databases and resources (NCBI, the AGR, publishers) to
synchronize content and to provide annotated echinoderm data. Although invisible to the user, there is a
considerable amount of computing that occurs behind the scenes every time a researcher uses Echinobase.
Echinobase is a complex computing environment consisting of multiple, separate databases, many different
software applications, user and curator web interfaces, and many automated data exchange pipelines. To
ensure stability and enhance performance, tool sets are isolated on their own virtual machines (VMs) - we
currently run ~10 VMs in our private cloud - and we constantly monitor, test, maintain, and fix bugs to keep it all
running smoothly. Each time new software is implemented, we test it on isolated VMs, then optimize and
integrate it with existing systems. Many of these systems, including the database and the web application
server, will be migrated to new systems in the new cycle, along with a move from private cloud to the public
cloud. All of this activity is contained within the Computation component and is paramount to achieving our
overall project goals. In this component, we describe the computing work needed to maintain current
functionality, generate custom content and the resources necessary to implement expansions and
improvements over the next award cycle.

10933439,"SUMMARY COMPUTATION 2
Improved Annotation of Echinoderm Genomic Features
Echinobase serves as a centralized resource for the most complete and accurate genome assemblies,
annotations, and transcriptomic data that exist for species in the phylum Echinodermata. The effectiveness of
the echinoderm research community is directly impacted by the quality of the data hosted on Echinobase. A
recent survey identified improvements to genome assemblies and gene annotations, including capturing gene
orthologs, as top priorities for the Echinobase user community.
Assembling echinoderm genomes has historically been challenging given the relatively high levels of
polymorphism and repetitive sequence common in these genomes. Recent advances in technologies and
algorithms for genome sequencing and assembly permit significant improvements to the contiguity and
accuracy of echinoderm genomes in our care, and this component addresses how this will be achieved.
Upgraded genome assemblies, along with the deluge of echinoderm transcriptome datasets, warrant the
re-annotation of gene models and enable the improved identification of orthologous relationships, both among
echinoderms and also to species outside of the phylum. This is a significant enhancement of Echinobase,
because the orthologs identified will serve to contextualize echinoderm research to a broader community of
developmental biologists.
Echinobase will also serve as a venue for easily synthesizing information obtained from high-throughput
assays of echinoderm development, including transcriptome and functional genomics datasets, along with
annotations of noncoding regulatory elements throughout the genome. These efforts will i) result in the
generation of recommendations for optimal approaches in the assembly of large polymorphic genomes, which
remains a difficult problem; ii) facilitate bioinformatic analyses involving echinoderm genomes; and iii) enable
the visualization of transcriptomic (particularly single-cell) datasets in genome browsers across multiple
species.
These efforts will enhance the capabilities of the echinoderm community to make genomic inquiries, and
increase the overall impact of this research. This is especially the case for GRN studies, which must draw on
all these types of evidence to support nodes and linkages. By enabling GRN studies, this component therefore,
supports the most impactful research in developmental biology for this phylum. Efforts to annotate and display
this data across multiple types of datasets, and multiple species, are unlikely to be undertaken by individual
investigators and thus only a focused effort as proposed here, as part of the overall Echinobase, can provide
this impactful resource."
10933442,"SUMMARY DISSEMINATION
Communication, Training and Outreach in Support of Enhanced Echinobase
Echinobase, a model organism knowledgebase (MOK) for the phylum of Echinodermata, is a web accessible
resource that integrates the vast and diverse genomic and biological data from the multiple species utilized for
echinoderm research. The Dissemination component is one part of a multi component project to maintain and
enhance the function and content of this resource that is essential for the echinoderm research community and
facilitates research productivity. The goal of Disseminate is to support current users, and attract more
Echinobase users by providing a functional, well-maintained, up-to-date destination for data managed using
FAIR principles, that is of interest to a broad community to empower researchers to make further advances,
particularly in understanding gene regulation and gene regulatory network function during development. Future
development efforts and features are guided by community member input and feedback, dialogue with the
Scientific Advisory Board, PIs and discussions with other MOKs. Plans are to actively engage users by
communicating progress and providing workshops for accessing, analyzing, and submitting data to
Echinobase. Scientific papers, talks and poster presentations at conferences such as the Society of
Developmental Biology, and the Developmental Biology of the Sea Urchin and other Marine Invertebrates
(DBSUMI) and virtually through EchinoClub, will present new updates, and aspects of echinoderm genomics to
a wide community. Disseminate will ensure that data is shared with external resources such as NCBI, Ensembl
and UniProt, continue collaborations with AGR and EBI and also enrich links from Echinobase to outside
resources. The ability to disseminate the features relies on communications between components that are
organized by the Admin Team. The past several years have proven a good working relationship between the
curation, computational and technical development teams for communicating ongoing activities and problems
and collaborating on creating Echinobase."
10911196,"INTERPRETABLE GRAPHICAL MODELS FOR LARGE MULTI-MODAL COPD DATA
ABSTRACT
One of the most important tasks in today’s era of precision medicine is to understand the mechanisms and the
factors affecting the development of clinical outcomes. Another important task is to develop interpretable,
predictive models for outcomes. In the last years, many machine learning methods have dominated the task of
predictive modeling, including deep learning, random forests and others. They are fueled by the unprecedent
volume of data that have been generated in some research areas. However, the interpretability of these methods
is not straight forward and their accuracy decreases when only small to medium size training datasets are
available. Furthermore, their predictive models do not uncover the complex web of interactions between other
variables in the dataset, which is essential for fully understanding disease mechanisms. Also, most such methods
are not well suited to accommodate mixed data types (e.g., continuous, discrete) in the same dataset.
Probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) offer a promising alternative to classical machine learning methods,
because they are flexible and versatile. They can identify both the direct (causal) relations between variables,
pointing to disease mechanisms, and build predictive models over diverse data, with good results even with
smaller training datasets. They have been used for classification, biomarker selection, identification of modifiable
risk factors of an outcome, or for mechanistic studies of perturbations of disease networks. In the previous years
we extended the PGM theoretical framework to the analysis of mixed continuous and discrete variables, with or
without unmeasured confounders; and we can now evaluate and incorporate prior information in mixed data
graph learning. We successfully applied those methods to diverse clinically important problems, including
malignancy prediction of undetermined lung nodules, identification of microbiome and other factors affecting
pneumonia, selection of SNP biomarkers for combination treatment of cancer patients.
Our objective is to develop novel interpretable methods for analysis of any-type data and use them to address
clinically relevant questions in COPD, an important chronic lung disease. Method evaluation will be done on
synthetic and real data, including parallel datasets with genomic, genetic, imaging and clinical COPD data. Our
central aim is to identify factors of disease mechanisms of progression using different modalities of patient data.
The deliverables will be (1) new PGM approaches for integrative analysis of any-type data; (2) a new, fully
documented software package (in R, Python) that can be incorporated in other pipelines; (3) a new web portal
to disseminate our methodologies to non-computer-savvy COPD researchers; (4) results on the pathogenesis
and predictive features of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This cross-disciplinary team project
is expected to have a positive impact beyond the above deliverables, since the generality of our approaches
makes them suitable for studying any disease; and they can be easily integrated into personalized medicine
strategies when high-throughput data collection will become a routine diagnostic procedure in all hospitals."

Neuroendocrine Tumors (NETs) occur in multiple organs and share many similarities. Although NETs are
relatively rare compared to breast and lung cancers, the incidence of NETs is steadily increasing. Conventional
therapies are not effective in treating NETs, and the survival rates of patients with NETs remain low. Trans-
differentiation to NETs is suggested as a mechanism of cancer therapy resistance across all epithelial cancers,
therefore it is important to understand the initiation and progression of NETs. However, challenges in studying
NETs have limited progress in developing therapies. Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a high-grade NET of the
skin that is more deadly than melanoma, with about 80% of cases caused by Merkel cell polyomavirus. This type
of NET with its viral oncogenic causal factors is thus a valuable model to investigate the biology of NETs. NETs
normally exhibit low mutation rates, and epigenetic modifications are hypothesized to be important drivers. In
this proposal, we will critically evaluate the role of Protein Arginine Methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) in MCC as an
epigenetic regulator in MCC by investigating PRMT5-mediated arginine methylation that is associated with
neuroendocrine differentiation. We hypothesize that PRMT5-mediated histone methylation and downstream
targets affected by this methylation are required for the maintenance of NET state of MCC and can additionally
affect cancer drug resistance. This project will (1) determine effects of PRMT5 on the NET identity of MCC and
drug resistance, and (2) identify PRMT5 targets associated with the NET state of MCC. Inhibitors for PRMT5 are
currently in clinical trials for several types of cancer, and understanding the molecular mechanisms of PRMT5
as an epigenetic regulator in MCC will help evaluate the use of PRMT5 inhibitors as a potential therapeutic
intervention not only for MCC but also for the treatment of other NETs."
10898843,"Abstract
We are proposing to establish the IU Bloomington Center for Cannabis, Cannabinoid, and Addiction (IUB-C3A)
as a NIDA Core Center for Excellence to serve addiction researchers both in the central Midwest and across
the nation. This Center will offer core services to further our understanding of fundamental brain processes
leading to or following the use of addictive drugs, particularly cannabis. The IUB-C3A will consist of two
service cores, a pilot project core, and an administrative core. The Administrative Core will provide a well-
defined structure for efficient center management, for public outreach, for organizing the Center’s courses, as
well as for preserving and making easily accessible the data generated by the Center’s scientists. The
Bioactive Lipid Mediators Core (BLMC) will provide analytical service for detecting cannabinoids and other
bioactive lipid mediators in biological samples and run a summer course directed towards underserved minority
college students interested in STEM careers. The MultiScale Imaging Core (MSIC) will offer services and
training across a range of light microscopic imaging modalities. The multiphoton resource of the MSIC will
include training and access to longitudinal in vivo imaging of calcium and other sensors (e.g., neuromodulators
such as endocannabinoids, dopamine, and serotonin) from very young ages as well as long-range pathway
tracing in “cleared” brain specimens. The STORM/confocal resource of the MSIC will offer users the
opportunity to perform correlative structure/function studies from the macro- to nanoscale level and will also
offer courses on these techniques. Both cores will emphasize innovation and integration of their respective
techniques, as outlined in the proposal. The Pilot Project Core will solicit pilot projects from C3A Affiliates and
investigators outside of the drug abuse field and mentor them through the process of obtaining data and NIDA
support for their research ideas. The PIs for the IUB-C3A have a long history of productive collaborations,
including publishing more than sixty papers together and holding several MPI NIH grants. The IUB-C3A is
conceptualized as a resource that will offer opportunities for other addiction investigators across the Central
Midwest (Southern Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, and West Virginia), a region strongly affected by drug
addiction, and across the nation. The IUB-C3A aims to increase diversity in addiction research through a
combination of summer experiences and pilot project programs targeted to under-represented populations in
neuroscience and addiction. A core goal of these programs is to bring talented individuals into the field of
addiction research. We anticipate that they will apply creative directions, rigorous experimental approaches,
and novel ways of thinking to a major public health problem. The strong support of Indiana University to this
endeavor is evident by generous matching funds for both equipment purchases and our diversity programs. All
of these factors predict that the IUB-C3A will become a regional and national resource for better understanding
and developing treatments for addictive disorders and their consequences."
10898844,"The Administrative Core will provide oversight and a cohesive framework to maximize the efficiency and
impact of the IU Bloomington Center for Cannabis, Cannabinoids and Addiction (IUB C3A). It will be led
by Dr. Ken Mackie, a Gill Chair and Distinguished Professor in the Department of Psychological and Brain
Sciences at IU Bloomington. Dr. Mackie has more than 30 years of experience in drug abuse research at the
University of Washington and Indiana University Bloomington (IUB). During this time his research has been
continuously funded by NIDA, NINDS and/or NCCIH, including serving as a project PI for two different NIDA
P01’s. He has served in several demanding administrative research positions at IUB, including directing the
Gill Center for nine years where he oversaw its substantial growth by recruiting four new endowed chairs to
IUB and the Gill Center. He and the other four C3A PIs have had longstanding and productive collaborations
(and Dr. Mackie played a major role in their recruitments to IUB) and has published more than 60 papers with
them over the last twenty years. All these factors suggest that the Administrative Core will function efficiently
to achieve the overall goals of the C3A.
The Administrative Core is efficiently structured to accomplish the following specific aims:
1. Provide the administrative framework to ensure that the goals of the IUB C3A are met. In addition to
Dr. Mackie, this framework includes the core PIs and key technical staff (together forming the Steering
Committee, responsible for governance and day-to-day Center operations), an internal advisory board (IAB),
and an external advisory board (EAB). The advisory boards will provide strategic advice to the PIs, help
review pilot projects, evaluate Center impact, and offer suggestions for improvement.
2. Facilitate communications within the Center, with the greater Drug Abuse community, and the
public. This will be done by organizing monthly center meetings, hosting external speakers, and managing
the Center’s internet and social media presence. An important activity of the Administrative Core will be
archiving and facilitating access to the data sets and other resources generated by the Center.
3. Organize the courses offered by the Centers. The Administrative Core will be responsible for the
administration of the two courses that will be offered by the Center. This will be done by publicizing the
courses, fielding questions about them and their content, handling registrations, providing advice on travel and
lodging, disbursing scholarships for appropriate students, liaising with IUB on integration of the summer BLMC
course with existing IUB URM-oriented summer courses, and collecting post-course evaluations and follow up.
4. Provide administrative support to improve the Core’s efficiency. Essential administrative activities that
are more efficient when centralized (e.g., ordering, fiscal management, compliance, animal management, etc.)
will be provided by the Administrative Core."
10898847,"SPECIFIC AIMS-Multiscale Imaging Core (MSIC)
Addictive substances trigger plasticity at the molecular, cellular and circuit levels that manifest as persistent
behavioral changes that may cause substance use disorders. Targeting these changes may lead to novel
strategies for preventing or treating substance use disorders. However, our knowledge of the molecular changes,
the cellular processes and the abnormal circuit activity patterns that underlie various aspects of substance use
disorders including compulsion, loss of intake control, withdrawal, and relapse is rather limited. To facilitate a
better understanding of the molecular to circuit level plasticity accompanying drug abuse, the C3A multi-
scale imaging core will support center investigators, affiliates from the Midwest and beyond, and trainees at
different career stages to acquire the conceptual and technical know-how, and to access state-of-the-art
equipment for nanoscale molecular measurements, for microscale anatomical analysis of subcellular and
cellular profiles and for mesoscale physiological imaging of brain circuits. The C3A multi-scale imaging core
will provide unprecedented imaging opportunities to examine models of substance use disorders at multiple
levels, including: (1) molecular and cellular level imaging with internationally unique cell-type- and subcellular
compartment-specific correlated STORM super-resolution imaging, and its recently developed
PharmacoSTORM extension for nanoscale pharmacology; (2) circuit level 2P imaging to examine selective
neural circuits and cell-type-specific dynamic physiological changes among large cell populations.
Aim 1. Determine the cell- and subcellular compartment-specific nanoscale molecular and microscale
cellular alterations triggered by chronic exposure to drugs of abuse. By employing fluorescent small
molecule-based PharmacoSTORM single-molecule nanoscale pharmacology and antibody-based
ImmunoSTORM super-resolution imaging, we and C3A-affiliated researchers will determine if chronic drug
exposure and/or withdrawal elicit persistently altered nanoscale distribution and abundance of important
signaling proteins in the cell types and brain circuits that are most relevant for substance use disorders. By
correlating the nanoscale molecular measurements with microscale confocal microscopy data, we will also
establish the associated morphological changes in identified subcellular compartments. Particular attention will
be devoted to CB1 cannabinoid and D3 dopamine receptors that have essential roles in all phases of the addiction
cycle and whose antagonists/negative allosteric modulators are among NIDA’s ten highest medication
development priorities.
Aim 2. Characterize the mesoscale circuit rewiring of long-range glutamatergic, dopaminergic and
serotonergic axons induced by developmental or chronic exposure to drugs of abuse. Axon tracts
connecting distant brain regions follow irregular trajectories, thus white matter morphology is difficult to evaluate
by standard brain section staining. Therefore, we will exploit our experience in ScaleS methodology combined
with optimized 2P imaging of the entire mouse brain. This approach will be used to determine the impact of
developmental exposure to THC and other drugs on the integrity and trajectory of identified long-range axons.
Because prenatal cannabis exposure modifies human neural circuits and rodent studies found that developing
long-range glutamatergic axons are particularly sensitive to THC, we will initially determine the impact of perinatal
THC exposure on glutamatergic axons originating from medial prefrontal cortex to various brain regions.
Aim 3. Use in vitro and in vivo 2P sensor imaging to determine the mesoscale physiological changes in
brain circuits elicited by chronic exposure to drugs of abuse. Recent advances in genetically encoded
sensors for Ca2+, endocannabinoids, and monoamines provide excellent tools to visualize dynamic changes of
these signaling molecules in a specific cell-type-specific manner in real-time. By combining our established and
comprehensive methodology for Ca2+_imaging in acute brain slices or awake behaving mice (as young as ten
days old) extending from the surgical procedure through the data analysis pipeline with High Performance
Computing together with GRAB-eCB2.1 and GRABDA sensor imaging, we will support center and affiliated
scientists to perform longitudinal 2P imaging to examine endocannabinoid, dopamine, and network activity
changes in their relevant models of substance use disorders. We will also determine if perinatal THC exposure
perturbs the development of endocannabinoid signaling in association with Ca2+-spike patterns in the primary
somatosensory cortex of awake behaving mouse pups from early postnatal to weaning ages.
Aim 4. Develop in vivo protocols for Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) in addiction
research. Drugs of abuse evoke substantial metabolic changes and perturb astrocyte-neuron interactions. We
will use 2P-FLIM imaging to develop in vivo applications using FLIM-based sensors to monitor energy
metabolism, signaling cascades, protein-protein interactions and to estimate the proximity between astrocytes
and neurons in the substance use disorder models established by local and affiliate researchers of the imaging
core."
10898850,"The Bioactive Lipid Mediators Core (BLMC) is designed to support the ongoing work of affiliated scientists
aiming to understand the systemic and neurophysiological outcomes of chronic drug use on lipid signaling.
The focus on lipid biomarkers targets an emerging field that has unique promise to add a novel framework
for understanding how lipid signaling in a wide range of tissues (e.g., plasma, CNS, liver, breast milk) is
related to homeostatic dysregulation associated with the development and maintenance of drug use
disorders. The Bradshaw lab has developed lipid extraction and analytical techniques aimed specifically at
small molecule lipid metabolites like the endocannabinoids, lipoamines, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and
resolvins. These classes of lipids of have been shown to change in response to exposure to drugs of abuse
and understanding this regulation has the potential to provide unique insight into how both acute and chronic
drug use drives both systemic and central nervous system changes. This understanding would then drive
the discovery of novel therapies to treat drug addiction. We will accomplish this by 1) Evaluation of plasma
lipidomics patterns in multiple drug abuse models. Using animal models of drug use (THC, opioids, alcohol)
we will use our optimized analytical techniques for analysis of bioactive lipid metabolite signaling molecules
in plasma to determine how acute and chronic drug exposure causes systemic changes in these lipid
classes. This analysis technique will then be used to determine how endogenous cannabinoid and related
lipid signaling molecules changes in different disease states (PTSD, concussion, drug addiction) in human
plasma. 2) Analyze sex difference in bioactive lipids in in targeted areas of the CNS with chronic drug use
as a function of genetic sex. This will provide a novel framework to evaluate unique characteristics across
and between drug models and sex. 3) Identification of changes in bioactive lipids in breast milk with
exposure to drugs of abuse (THC, opioids). Lipidomics analysis of breastmilk in rodent models of drug use
(THC, opioids) will provide a clearer understanding on how the presence of these drugs changes the lipid
profile of breastmilk in a way that may have long term health consequences for offspring. 4) Develop data
science analytical techniques of bioactive lipid metabolites to drive novel hypotheses on how drugs of abuse
cause changes in systemic and CNS lipid signaling. Coupling the power of increasingly powerful analytical
techniques with novel data mining and cluster analyses developed in-house will provide the field with new
tools for interpreting lipid metabolomic information. 5) Increase the pipeline for underrepresented minority
(URM) students for careers in STEM with a focus on lipidomic mass spectrometric techniques. In
partnership with minority serving programs at IU, URM students will be provided unique opportunities for
training and research that are tailored to the field of lipidomics and mass spectrometry as well as multiple
programmatic opportunities for professional development."
10898854,"Pilot Project Core Abstract
The IUB Center for Cannabis, Cannabinoids and Addiction (C3A) Pilot Project Core will establish a pilot project
program designed to support 2 to 4 new projects/year. The Pilot Project Core PI is Professor Norbert Hájos,
who holds a Gill Chair of Neuroscience. Its goal is to support and encourage innovative and exploratory
projects from trainees and establish investigators exploring new lines of research related to substance abuse.
Pilot projects will be solicited annually from C3A Affiliates and their trainees. We anticipate that some of these
pilot project proposals will come from trainees supported by our NIDA-T32, DA024628. Each proposal will be
reviewed by 2 members of the External Advisory Board and 2 members of the Internal Advisory Board.
Proposals will be ranked by the following priorities: 1. Support of young investigators/investigators new to the
addiction field. 2. Support of groups historically underrepresented in drug abuse research. 3. A project that
will maximally benefit from access to either the BLM or MSPM cores. 4. Obtain preliminary data for NIDA grant
application. 5. Includes a component of high risk/high payout. Low priority will be given to proposals that
merely supplement ongoing funded research. All applicants will receive feedback on their proposals and will be
offered the opportunity to be mentored by a C3A PI or Affiliate in subsequent applications to the C3A or
external agencies. Successful applicants will be assigned a Core staff member to optimize experimental
design with the technical capabilities of the relevant core(s) utilized and matched with a IUB C3A Center
Affiliate to provide guidance in the substance abuse field. Awardees will present their work at least three times
to the monthly C3A research meetings and once to the external advisory board. A summary report will also be
prepared when the project is completed.
Based on these criteria, we have chosen two projects for the initial submission of this P30. Pilot Project 1 has
been proposed by Gabriel Nah, a graduate student working with Dr. Jonathan Crystal, a Provost Professor at
IU Bloomington. Mr. Nah’s project uses a rat model to examine the impact of adolescent THC exposure on the
lipidomic, anatomical, molecular, and cognitive changes following mild traumatic brain injury and will use both
the lipidomics and imaging cores. Pilot Project 2 has been proposed by Center Affiliate, Dr. Shanna Babalonis,
as assistant professor at the University of Kentucky studying multi-drug use in human populations. Dr.
Babalonis’ project will use the lipidomics core to examine the plasma lipidome and phytocannabinoid levels in
opioid users in a controlled setting with and without inhaled cannabis exposure. These two pilot projects meet
the goals of the Pilot Project Core in the following ways: Project 1 supports an African American graduate
student working on a significant question addressing the impact of prior drug use on the sequelae of traumatic
brain injury. Project 2 supports an early-stage investigator examining the interactions between cannabinoids,
lipids, and opioids in a clinical population."
10932168,"ABSTRACT – PROJECT 1
The main objective of Project 1 is to deconvolute the molecular features of high-risk gastric cancer precursor
lesions. Dr. Hanlee Ji, Project Leader, previously found that the epithelium of early gastric cancer is characterized
by distinct genomic, transcriptomic and cellular properties. In addition, the Ji Group has identified a distinct gene
expression profile associated with high-risk precancerous gastric lesions compared to low-risk lesions and
normal controls. Project 1 represents a continuation of this work with a specific focus on characterizing the
genetic and molecular profile of precancerous gastric tissue. There are two specific aims to this project:
 (1) Identify the specific gene expression signatures associated with high-risk gastric intestinal metaplasia
(GIM).
 (2) Characterize aberrant epithelial cells and their subtypes in high-risk gastric cancer precursors.
In Aim 1, Dr. Ji will employ bulk RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to study GIM lesions that range
across the spectrum of neoplastic progression. Hp infection status will be used as a stratifying risk factor. These
results will identify the molecular profile associated with the highest risk of progression to gastric cancer and Hp-
associated alterations in stomach cells. Aim 2 will use single cell multi-omics to identify the subset of GIM
epithelial cells with somatic mutations, copy number alterations and epigenetic patterns that are associate with
gastric cancer. The results will determine the genetic and genomic features of epithelial cells that comprise high-
risk precancerous lesions in the stomach. Ultimately, this project will elucidate the precise molecular and cellular
features associated with high-risk GIM to gain novel insight into the molecular, cellular and genomic factors that
contribute to a high-risk premalignant state."
10932174,"ABSTRACT – PROJECT 2
The central purpose of Project 2 is to utilize a primary human tissue model to investigate the features of gastric
stem cells and how the cells interact with Helicobacter pylori (Hp). Hp commonly triggers an inflammatory
process that leads to gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM), a condition that can evolve into invasive carcinoma.
However, not all people with GIM develop gastric cancer. This project proposes an experimental platform to
investigate the features of high-risk GIM. Its hypothesis is that high-risk GIM lesions possess epithelial stem cells
with unique properties predisposed to neoplastic progression, especially in the setting of Hp infection. Project 2
has three aims to investigate this hypothesis:
 (1) Characterizing the epithelial progenitor cells of high-risk GIM.
 (2) Modeling genomic alterations from high-risk GIM.
 (3) Elucidating interactions between Hp and gastric organoids from high-risk GIM.
For Aim 1, Dr. Amieva’s group will develop a library of stem-cell rich, apical-out gastric organoids representing
the gastric neoplastic spectrum across various topographical locations in the stomach. The characteristics of
these stem cell organoids will be identifying using next generation sequencing and advanced microscopy. In
Aim 2, the organoids will be perturbed with select genetic alterations (identified in Project 1) through CRISPR
gene editing. Subsequent changes to gene expression may provide insight into the biology of high-risk versus
low-risk GIM tissues. Lastly in Aim 3, the investigators will infect apical-out gastric organoids (from Aim 1) with
human-derived Hp strains of known genotypes and phenotypes. Single-cell genomics will allow investigators to
distinguish the unique transcriptional profiles of organoids at different time points, states of infection and
inflammation, and enable studies into bacterial genes that are crucial for colonization and host perturbations.
While Project 2 will be conducted in a basic research laboratory, its aims and results are directly related to
improving overall understanding of Hp behavior in the human stomach, and molecular changes that prime tissue
for carcinogenesis."

10892952,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The development of general methods for the construction of sp3-rich (i.e. highly three-dimensional) organic
scaffolds is a longstanding challenge in organic synthesis. High sp3 character imparts beneficial biological
activities and pharmacokinetic properties into organic molecules, but because of their complexity, such
compounds are underrepresented in libraries for drug discovery relative to sp2-rich compounds. Transition metal
catalysis has revolutionized the construction of sp2-rich organic scaffolds, producing an array of general
transformations that allow for the facile synthesis of diverse libraries of compound analogues for developing
novel small molecule therapeutics. To establish similarly versatile methods for synthesizing sp3-rich organic
scaffolds from simple starting materials, innovations in catalysis are needed. The research proposed herein
employs innovative ligand and catalyst design as a means to discover novel and general scaffold-building
methodologies that can transform simple starting materials (i.e. alkenes, dienes, arenes) into functionally and
structurally complex products. In one area, we are developing unconventional ligand platforms that occupy
underpopulated regions of ligand space for Pd catalysis for the development of olefin carbofunctionalization
reactions. We have found that ligands derived from urea, which occupy a region of small organic ligands that is
inaccessible to phosphines and N-heterocyclic carbenes, effectively promote heteroannulation reactions of
ambiphiles and dienes. In addition, phosphine ligands with unconventional steric profiles can exert ligand control
over site-selectivity for heteroannulations with dienes. Future work in this area will focus on expanding on these
findings to develop a unified synthetic approach to preparing diverse aliphatic heterocycles, as well as selective,
multicomponent carbofunctionalization reactions of olefins. These methodological developments will be enabled
by both rational ligand design and computationally-aided ligand discovery. In another area, we are establishing
Cu-diamine complexes as general catalysts for oxidative, radical addition reactions. Central to our reaction
design is coordinating Cu catalysts to the substrate, which promotes selective generation of reactive radical
intermediates that can add to olefins and arenes. Using this approach, we have discovered an aerobic amino-
oxygenation of internal alkenes that engages diverse aryl-substituted alkenes and operates under mild
conditions. Designing ligands that enhance the oxidative potential of Cu and facilitate coordination to substrates
will enable the discovery of new catalytic reactivity in oxidative, radical olefin addition reactions, and provides a
framework for the development of highly enantioselective transformations. These reactions will enable the rapid
construction of diverse functional motifs and cyclic scaffolds with excellent catalyst control over chemoselectivity
and stereoselectivity. In total, the proposed research program will result in the development of versatile catalytic
methods for the efficient preparation of functional molecules that are relevant for discovering compounds with
therapeutic potential, and thus will have a significant impact on biomedical sciences and human health."
10896318,"Project Summary 
Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) are generated at unprecedented scale in order to link genetic variation to susceptibility to disease and other traits. But as the name suggests, GWAS only generate correlation data-and numerous challenges follow. Combining GWAS data with advanced population genetics tools provides a tremendous opportunity to learn about the genetics and evolution of complex human traits; but we need new statistical methods to realize the possible benefits. My lab will develop such statistical methods and apply them to complex biomedical traits, drawing directly on my previous work and expertise in population genetics, statistical genetics, and computation. First, we will tackle a major concern hindering the adoption of polygenic scores-genetic predictors of complex traits, derived from GWAS: Their poorer performance in groups that differ-whether in genetic ancestry, environmental or social exposures-from the samples in which the GWAS was performed. We will develop a mechanistic understanding of the determinants of the prediction accuracy of polygenic scores, thereby advancing complex trait genetics research for the benefit of all people-in particular historically underserved and underrepresented groups. Second, we will characterize gene-by-environment interactions in complex traits. There is ample evidence that such interactions are common but evidence from GWAS has been underwhelming. We propose a new approach for characterizing gene-by-environment interactions, that might solve this apparent discrepancy: A model that expects concerted changes in magnitude of effects across a large set of variants, e.g. in response to an environmental cue. Where this model fits, it will be germane to phenotypic prediction and to the problem of polygenic score portability across groups. Finally, we will leverage the results of the research described above to study natural selection on complex traits in recent human history. We will focus on two directions: (i) Developing a new method to the study of selection on complex human traits-built upon a marriage between the statistical power of standard GWAS and the immunity of family studies to various GWAS confounders; and (ii) Understanding how variants with genetic effects contingent on the environment evolve. The history of environment-specific selection is hypothesized to have been highly consequential for human health. We will develop new theory and a matching statistical inference tool to understand selective constraint on gene-by- environment interactions, and their consequences for contemporary genetic architecture of complex diseases."
10907760,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Natural products (NPs) have historically been a critical source of bioactive molecules, with NPs and their
derivatives making up over 50% of FDA-approved small molecule drugs. In recent years, NP-based drug
discovery is facing a fundamental barrier in identifying new drugs due to repeated rediscovery of the same or
similar compounds, representing limited chemical diversity. Fortunately, since NPs have been evolving over
billions of years in trillions of vastly diverse environments, there is an abundance of new bioactive NPs encoded
in nature which may be useful as drugs. However, their accessibility is a problem: only less than 10% of NP
biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) have been connected to existing NPs, leaving the vast majority of BGCs
untapped as to what NPs they may produce. The overall goal of this research program is to leverage big-data
informatic analysis and biosynthetic investigation to access and convert the tremendous genetic potential of
these “orphan BGCs”, BGCs with unknown products, into chemical reality, connecting them to their products and
in turn supplying structurally diverse pools of NPs for drug discovery screening. To this end, we propose two
research directions: (1) Utilizing our established big-data correlational networking analysis, we have identified
hidden proteases missing from the BGCs of almost all class III lanthipeptides. We previously used this method
to discover two new families of class III lanthipeptides from Firmicutes for the first time. We will leverage these
hidden proteases to further unlock the inherent chemical diversity of lanthipeptides and generate two libraries of
natural and non-natural peptides through in vitro enzymatic synthesis and targeted biosynthetic engineering for
drug discovery screening. (2) Mining the untapped microbial genetic potential, with an initial emphasis on sulfur-
containing NPs and unprecedented biosynthetic pathway hybridization, we have prioritized two promising orphan
BGCs with highly unique enzymology and connected them to their native products. The first features a novel S-
hydroxylating flavoprotein, potentially involved in the formation of a new sulfur-containing functionality. The
second has an unprecedented terpenoid-fatty acid-non-ribosomal peptide hybridization mediated by unusual
cross-pathway enzymatic combinations. We will further investigate the new biosynthesis harbored by these
BGCs to produce new NPs, inform future genome mining of similar pathways, and enable pathway engineering
to further increase NPs chemical diversity. Our significant progress in both research directions supports the
feasibility of this proposal as well as our competence to establish a successful and sustainable independent
program in this field. We have fostered several key collaborations in bioactivity screening and protein structural
biology that further strengthen our research program. In addition, this program will provide opportunities to train
undergraduates, graduates, and postdoctoral fellows. Overall, this program is expected to discover new
biosynthesis, expand NPs chemical diversity, and facilitate informatics-based NPs discovery and bioengineering
to provide promising new drug leads."

Recent research shows the prevalence of depression symptoms in the US was more than 3-fold higher during
COVID-19 compared with before the COVID-19 pandemic. Prevalence of depression among Blacks pre-
COVID was 8.4% and during-COVID pandemic 24.2%. Although the prevalence of depression is comparable
among Blacks and Whites, the difference is dramatically reversed for severe depression. African
Americans/Blacks have higher symptom levels for chronicity and disability, 56.5% vs. 38.6% for Whites. These
disparities are even more stark for African Americans in the Madison, Wisconsin the proposed research site.
Blacks in Wisconsin are 50% more likely than Whites to report having frequent mental distress. Despite the
burden of living with depression, African Americans do not seek mental health services at comparable rates to
other demographic groups. National mental health service use data show Whites use at 23.0% and African
Americans at 13.6% in the past 12 months. Culturally adapted treatments designed for African American adults
have the potential to address and potentially stop these health disparities; research shows culturally adapted
treatments to be four times more effective than standardized care. Despite growing literature indicating African
Americans are more likely to use religious coping when experiencing mental illness, empirically validated
culturally adapted faith-based depression interventions do not exist for this group. To address this gap, the PI
forged transformative partnerships with the African American Council of Churches to develop a faith-based
intervention: Cognitive Behavioral Faith Fellowship to Improve Thy Health (CB-FAITH). CB FAITH is spiritually-
based whereby spiritual/religious themes, stories, and scripture are integrated in the core cognitive behavioral
content. The 13-treatment modules focus on increasing knowledge of depression and healthy coping
behaviors. It is designed to be co-delivered by African American licensed mental health clinicians and African
American pastors at churches. We propose conducting a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial
employing a stepped wedge cluster randomized design with church groups as the unit of randomization,
providing simultaneous testing of the intervention and assessment of barriers and facilitators to implementation
of the intervention. The sample will be comprised of 10 groups, each with 12 individuals (N=120) who identify
as African American men and women (age 25 and older) with clinical depression. Clinical outcomes will be
measured at baseline, weeks 6 and 12 during the intervention, and post-intervention at 3 and 6 months. For
the implementation arm of the study, we will use the RE-AIM conceptual framework to examine
implementation. Use of surveys and semi-structured interviews focusing on RE-AIM concepts at individual and
organizational level will be conducted during and at the end of the intervention implementation. Results of this
trial has the potential to advance the AHRQ’s goal of achieving equity in the delivery of healthcare services.

10884899,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The vaginal tract is a harsh, polymicrobial ecosystem that has an active immune response, is rich in
cervicovaginal mucins, and has a robust microbiota. Bacterial persistence within this environment requires the
ability of organisms to adapt to changes in nutrient availability and to interact with the other members of the
microbiota. The vaginal microbiota is classified by five community state types, in which state types I, II, III, and
V are dominated by Lactobacillus species, while community state type IV is marked by increased community
diversity and is loosely termed “dysbiotic”. Our definition of what constitutes vaginal health is evolving; however,
our understanding of the fundamental principles that impact community structure and function, and the role
individual microbes have in community stability is unknown. Determining the interactions that contribute to
persistence within this dynamic environment is challenging, as these are multifactorial in nature. Here, we
propose interdisciplinary approaches to understand the microbial ecology of the vaginal tract and advance our
basic knowledge of vaginal health. Our objective is to determine how the nutritional landscape within the vagina
impacts microbial community assembly, structure, and interactions, that together, contribute to persistent
colonization. We will define metal availability within the vaginal tract and use these data to understand how
changes in the environment shape composition and function of bacterial communities. From this, we will identify
differential importance of bioavailable metals for persistence and expansion of community members. We will
investigate the mechanisms of metal ion homeostasis and determine their impact on cellular metabolism,
cooperation, and competition within microbial communities. We will develop in silica models and validate
mechanisms of metabolic interaction between members of the vaginal microbiota and determine the role of these
interactions in community synergy. Our goal is to define how vaginal ecology drives community interactions and
crosstalk to promote colonization in this complex environment. These findings have the potential to link metal
availability, cellular metabolism, and microbial community structure in vivo. Together, this proposal will use
synthetic vaginal communities to profile the genetic, physiological, and ecological mechanisms that drive
microbial interactions in the vaginal mucosa. These findings will provide a better understanding of the ecological
factors that contribute to vaginal community composition, stability, and interactions. This work will advance our
fundamental knowledge and identify relevant therapeutic targets that could serve to promote efforts in
maintaining vaginal health."

The North Idaho Bridges to Baccalaureate (NI-B2B) program will establish an enduring partnership between
the University of Idaho (U of I) and North Idaho College (NIC). We identified a large cohort of biology-interested
undergraduate students at NIC, half of whom are from populations underrepresented (UR) in sciences. The
number of NIC students who transfer to complete a biomedical related bachelor’s degree at U of I is low (~35
students per year) and there are few undergraduate research opportunities for NIC students. Surveys of NIC
students revealed barriers to transfer including lack of knowledge about degree plans and financial hardships.
A self-assessment conducted at U of I identified undergraduate research-oriented departments and mentors
with experience supporting UR in science students. These self-studies are the basis for the proposed five-
year project to increase the number and diversity of students in biomedical research by partnering NIC
students with U of I faculty mentors. To do so, we will pursue two program objectives: 1) increase the number
of NIC to U of I transfer students by 10% per year of the program (from 35 to 55+ per year over five years) and
2) increase the graduation rate and matriculation of U of I UR students into graduate research programs by
50% over baseline during the project period. Rationale: NIC currently offers only six research opportunities for
>1,800 biology-interested students and has a low go-on rate, limiting the pipeline of UR students into graduate
research programs and careers. The NI-B2B program will develop a pipeline program to increase the number
and diversity of students entering graduate research programs and careers. Research Training Program
Design: The program objectives will be met by achieving the following program goals: Aim 1. Increase the
number and diversity of students pursuing biomedical research careers by developing a transfer
pathway for NIC students. We will integrate interdisciplinary Course-based Undergraduate Research
Experiences (CURE) labs into existing NIC courses to promote transfer and completion of a four-year degree.
The CURE course will also serve to introduce and recruit applicants into the NI-B2B program. Aim 2. Immerse
NI-B2B scholars in biomedical research experiences. We will immerse cohorts of 6 NIC students in
biomedical research experiences with a faculty mentor at U of I during the summers before and after bridging
to U of I. Aim 3. Prepare NI-B2B scholars for graduate studies by embedding them in a mentored
research environment and by helping students develop competitive graduate program applications.
We will integrate students into a research team and a NI-B2B scholars cohort. Students will learn to conduct
independent research in a mentored research environment and learn to interpret and communicate scientific
results as they consolidate a scientist identity. Students will prepare to take the GRE and learn to select and
develop tailored graduate program applications as part of the NI-B2B cohort."
10928770,"SUMMARY. This proposal is in response to PAR-21-038: Stephen I. Katz Early Stage Investigator Research
Project Grant. Aging is a major risk factor for the development of cognitive deficits and neurodegenerative
diseases. Understanding the exact molecular mechanisms of brain aging and accelerated brain aging can lead
to the development of novel interventions to delay or potentially reverse brain aging. Environmental factors
including viral infections (such as SARS-CoV-2, the virus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic) have been
shown to be associated with cognitive decline and accelerated brain aging. However, the exact molecular
mechanisms underlying the effects of environmental factors, and specifically COVID-19, on brain aging remain
unknown. Our long-term goal is to identify key factors that induce accelerated brain aging, so that therapeutics
can be developed to delay or reverse brain aging. The overall objective of this proposal is to identify genes and
regulators of gene expression that cause brain aging and accelerated brain aging in COVID-19 patients. Previous
research from our group showed that many microRNAs (miRNAs), which are small non-coding RNAs that induce
an orchestrated regulation of gene expression, are differentially expressed in the aged mouse brain and regulate
aging. Based on those data and our recently published bulk RNA sequencing studies showing molecular
signatures of brain aging in COVID-19 patients, our central hypothesis is that dysregulated gene and miRNA
expression is an important facet of accelerated brain aging. Previous studies using microarray and bulk RNA
sequencing approaches showed that aging induces distinct molecular signatures in the human frontal cortex.
While layer enriched expression signatures have been identified in the human frontal cortex, the spatial
topography of molecular signatures of aging remain largely unknown. Here, we will utilize state-of-the-art spatial
transcriptomic technologies to analyze human frontal cortex sections from healthy individuals across lifespan,
as well as frontal cortex sections from COVID-19 patients (and appropriate controls) to identify spatially distinct
aging-regulated transcriptomic changes. We will investigate the effects of aging-regulated genes on cellular
senescence using in vitro assays. To better understand regulatory mechanisms of aging-regulated gene
expression, we will measure the expression of miRNAs in healthy individuals across lifespan and COVID-19
cases on similar frontal cortex sections and we will identify aging-regulated mRNA targets for candidate miRNAs.
Finally, we will test the potential of miRNAs to accelerate and delay aging using in vitro assays and in vivo mouse
models. These studies are expected to have a significant impact as they will determine novel targets for the
development of therapeutics to delay or reverse brain aging and aging-related neuropathology. This proposal is
highly relevant to public health and to the NIA’s mission of advancing knowledge on the causes of aging
processes and age-associated diseases to extend healthy lifespan."
10890830,"Project Summary
The Wei Lab develops accurate and scalable inference methods in population genetics and
statistical genetics. In the next few years, we will focus on understanding the evolution and
genetic basis of complex traits. Large biobank datasets with hundreds of thousands of human
genomes and tens of thousands of phenotypic measurements provide unprecedented
opportunities to understand complex phenotypes. At the same time, these massive data sets
demand more scalable and unbiased computational methods. My lab recently developed new
algorithms and data structures to improve the scalability of standard computations involving
genotype matrices, including the calculation of heritability components and linkage
disequilibrium scores. Our RSHE method runs 10-100x faster than the current state-of-the-art
method to allow heritability analysis on biobank-size whole-genome sequencing data. Further
methodological improvements will require new conceptualizations of the genotype-phenotype
relationships. Conventional statistical genetics uses genotype matrices directly, ignoring that
genetic polymorphisms are organized by gene genealogy into an interpretable graph structure.
Whole-genome genealogies can now be readily inferred using ancestral recombination graph
(ARG) inference software. Studying genealogy-phenotype relationships on ARGs could pinpoint
causal mutations, reduce multiple testing, promote algorithm efficiency, and integrate
evolutionarily meaningful models. We are developing a scalable algorithm for ARG-wide
association studies and will demonstrate its advantages even in the face of uncertainty in ARG
reconstruction. We will also develop fine-mapping methods on ARGs to study homogeneous
and admixed populations. Leveraging our RSHE code, we will implement a scalable method for
estimating heritability from ARGs and will apply this new method to the UK biobank to
understand why heritability estimated in unrelated individuals is lower than that from pedigree
analyses. Building upon this, we will implement a novel model parameterization to study
complex trait evolution using ARGs. Current polygenic adaptation papers all inevitably assume
that GWAS significant SNPs can be treated as causal variants and that different polygenicity
levels across phenotypes can be ignored. Our proposed method will provide the first rigorous
framework that takes these factors into account. In summary, this proposal will develop methods
to fully integrate ARGs into statistical genetics to better understand and conceptualize
phenotype-genealogy relationships. It will provide more scalable computational tools for the field
in response to the rapidly growing biomedical data and enable novel and more calibrated
discoveries for human disease genetics and phenotypic evolution."

DNA cytosine methylation is a central epigenetic modification in mammalian cells. Aberrant DNA methylation
has been linked to gene dysregulation and genomic instability, resulting in cancer and other diseases. Ten-
Eleven Translocation (TET) is the essential enzyme family responsible for DNA demethylation to ensure the
proper maintenance of the methylome. TET enzymes oxidize 5-methylcytosines (5mC) into mainly 5-
hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), an intermediate for DNA demethylation and a potential epigenetic mark.
Germline deficiency of TET2 is associated with immunodeficiency and childhood cancers. Notably, TET2 is
one of the most frequently mutated genes in hematological cancers, demonstrating the importance of TET in
multiple biological processes. We and others have shown that TET enzymes are essential for cell
differentiation by regulating super-enhancers and inducing the expression of lineage-specific genes. However,
the mechanism by which TET enzymes facilitate the permissive chromatin environment for gene activation
remains unclear. The long-term goals of the research program are: (1) to comprehensively understand how
TET enzymes and 5hmC promote chromatin accessibility; (2) to investigate the crosstalk between TET and
histones; (3) to understand the consequences of temporary perturbation of epigenome. To accomplish these
goals, we will use precision epigenome editing to manipulate and monitor epigenetic modifications of cis-
elements regulated by TET and DNA methylation. We will develop novel animal models to study the impact of
acute and reversible TET deficiency and a sequencing method to map multiple DNA modifications and
chromatin accessibility simultaneously on a single DNA molecule. Our research will provide crucial mechanistic
insights into how TET and DNA modifications regulate gene expression and cell differentiation. Our findings
will potentially identify genes involved in immunodeficiency and cancer, providing an opportunity to develop
targeted treatments."

Altered lubrication of articular cartilage following joint injury increases friction between the sliding cartilage
surfaces, leads to deterioration of cartilage, and hastens the development of osteoarthritis (OA). OA due to joint
injury, termed as post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA), is estimated to account for at least 12% of all OA cases
in the United States and approximately half of the individuals with an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury
develop PTOA regardless of the ACL reconstruction. Replenishing the synovial fluid and thereby restoring the
articular cartilage lubrication has been demonstrated to benefit the joint. The overarching goal of the proposed
study is to investigate the potential of cartilage-adhering, self-healing hyaluronic acid molecules to prevent or
delay the degeneration of articular cartilage, and thereby osteoarthritis, following injury or trauma. The
molecularly engineered HA-based lubricants are designed to integrate the function of both hyaluronic acid and
lubricin, two key components of the synovial fluid, while exhibiting self-repairing ability. The self-healing
properties are incorporated to ensure both long-term retention and adaptability of the lubricant within the
mechanically active joint, while the cartilage adhering properties are expected to improve boundary lubrication.
We hypothesize that the dynamic cartilage-adhering molecules that integrate the molecular features of HA and
lubricin and simultaneously exhibit self-healing properties will protect the articular cartilage and prevent or slow
down the progression of PTOA. Towards this, we will: (i) develop cartilage-adhering, self-healing HA molecules
and determine the effect of molecular architecture-lubrication function relationship, (ii) determine the effect of the
molecular architecture of the proposed novel HA-based lubricants on chondroprotection by using a joint-on-chip
platform, and (iii) determine the effect of these lubricants on mitigating the development of post-traumatic
osteoarthrits. The proposed studies will enable a new paradigm in which intra-articular injection of self-healing
HA-bottle brush molecules could be an important treatment following acute injury to ameliorate or delay PTOA,
or they could be used as an adjunct after surgical repair to improve the outcome."

 The proposed studies focus on the design, synthesis, and development of a range of vanadium-
based catalysts to perform carbon isotope exchange via =*CH2 (*C = 11C, 13C, and 14C) group transfer
between terminal olefins. Carbon isotope exchange is an emerging area that allows incorporating carbon-
14 isotope directly into target compounds for metabolic and pharmacokinetic studies. Furthermore, the
integration of carbon-11 into pharmaceuticals is an indispensable tool in positron emission tomography. The
innovation of the proposed work is the development of olefin metathesis catalysts based on the first-row
transition metal, vanadium, to take advantage highly polarized V=C bond. These V alkylidenes feature
enabled regioselective formation of metallacyclobutane, resulting in reversible =CH2 transfer between
terminal olefins without formation of cross-products and ethylene, which is supported by our preliminary
results and DFT studies. Therefore, V-catalyze carbon isotope exchange can serve as a new platform to
incorporate labeled carbon atoms into a wide range of pharmaceuticals and natural products without
developing new multi-step synthetic strategies. The proposed approach uses accessible labeled
iodomethane (*CH3I) as a carbon isotope source and can be applied to compounds containing various
common functional groups. The method will be expanded to alkyl-containing bioactive molecules utilizing a
tandem dehydrogenation/olefin metathesis strategy. Therefore, the first example of carbon isotope
exchange involving the methyl group will be introduced. The utility of the new concepts, catalysts, and
protocols will be emphasized through applications to the concise synthesis of isotopically labeled
pharmaceuticals and natural products."

The University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC)
College of Medicine and the University of Nebraska Omaha's Biology Department and its programs in Native
American Studies and in Medical Humanities, will leverage the trust and cooperative spirit that has been
garnered working with tribal schools and communities in Nebraska, South Dakota and Arizona to develop,
implement, and evaluate cancer-related science curricula and research experiences aimed to support Native
American students. The UNMC in community-based cancer prevention
combined with the Munroe- excellence in educational outreach and the first-rate basic and
translational cancer research in state-of-the-art laboratories at the Eppley Institute in the NCI-designated Fred
& Pamela Buffett Cancer Center are consolidated in the UNMC Youth Enjoy Science program (UNMC-YES)
for the benefit of Native American students' education in all aspects of cancer research. The long-term goals
of this project are to promote student interest in the sciences, foster a more science-literate public,
and increase the number of Native Americans entering health and science careers with a particular
emphasis in cancer research. UNMC-YES aims to: 1) Cultivate and sustain trusting community partnerships
to expand outreach initiated in the original grant cycle to rural and urban Native American students, 2)
Develop, disseminate and implement culturally relevant, technology-based cancer education curricula with
Native American populations, and 3) Expand Native American student horizons through hands-on, culture-
and standards-based science activities, research experiences and exposure to health science careers. These
aims will be accomplished through innovative and evidence-based 1) outreach and engagement, 2) curriculum
development and dissemination, and 3) provision of research experiences. UNMC-YES will generate and
deliver cancer-related activities, lessons and research experiences to Native American students in grades 6
through undergraduate. UNMC-YES will also provide teachers with research experiences, workshops,
mentoring, and in-service education to facilitate implementation of project curriculum with Native American
students. Student participants will experience a range of highly intensive activities such as summer research
camps to higher frequency activities such as school-based science clubs, mentored cancer research
internships, and ongoing research talking circles. Professional evaluations will be made at all stages, with
major emphasis on the educational, professional and community impact of the project. Pre- and post-test
measures will analyze participant outcomes. Stakeholder perspectives and community systems for reducing
cancer will be assessed to inform continuous improvement. Our objective is not only to increase Native
American representation in cancer-related health professions and research but also to advance the health of
Native Peoples through improvements in cancer prevention, treatment, and research."

 Molecular mechanisms of innate immunity are constantly changing as organisms evolve to defend
against the threats of newly emerged pathogens. As a consequence, our innate immune pathways are a
patchwork of both ancient and recently evolved proteins. How did mechanisms of innate immunity arise, and
how have these pathways adapted to integrate new defenses? The answers to these questions are important
because these dynamics have shaped the functions of modern-day immunity, determining how hosts are
protected from infectious diseases. Moreover, because immune pathways are evolutionarily flexible, they can
serve as an excellent model for how cellular signaling networks assemble and diversify more broadly.
 We focus on the evolution of cell-autonomous immunity, which provides critical protections within
infected cells. Aspects of cell-autonomous immunity are found across eukaryotes, including in unicellular
phagocytic organisms that interact with bacteria in natural environments. To understand how ancient immune
proteins have assembled into modern mammalian pathways, we use diverse eukaryotes at ideal
phylogenetic positions to uncover the origins and evolution of innate immunity. We use the highly
tractable Dictyostelium system to discover and characterize antibacterial defenses in amoebae, while
leveraging additional eukaryotes to understand how immune proteins and pathways have evolved. Our
experiments integrate molecular, biochemical, genetic, cellular, evolutionary, and genomic approaches to
reveal genes functionally important for defending against bacterial infections in diverse organisms. Because
cell-autonomous defenses are easier to observe and study in haploid, unicellular species, these experiments
promise to uncover new mechanisms of cell-autonomous immunity. Some of these mechanisms may be
deeply conserved with immune defenses in animals, allowing us to reconstruct how these immune pathways
arise and change. Other immune mechanisms in these diverged eukaryotes may represent novel evolutionary
solutions to the problem of cellular defense, yielding both practical molecular tools such as new antimicrobials
and novel paradigms of immunity."

This R35 leadership application is relevant to Milestone 6D of the goals/milestones of the NIH Alzheimer’s
disease and Alzheimer’s disease related dementias (AD/ADRD) Summits—“Initiate drug discovery efforts to
develop novel therapeutic agents.” Our overriding goal in this application is to support the infrastructure the PI
is assembling for AD/ADRD drug discovery at Scripps Research, which will continue well after the award is
over. Our major planned milestone is aimed to INSPIRE program building and create team building for
AD/ADRD Drug Discovery using the very considerable institutional resources at Scripps Research and
its Calibr Drug Discovery Center. We are also building one of the nation’s top-ranked Graduate School
programs in drug discovery via our mentoring using the faculty of Scripps’ #1/#2-ranked chemistry-
biochemistry departments in the world. As proof of feasibility, of the six currently FDA-approved medicines for
AD, three were developed out of the PI, Dr. Lipton’s laboratory. Via this R35 Leadership Application, Dr. Lipton
will mentor others to develop AD/ADRD-related drugs acting at novel targets toward disease-modifying
therapy. Specifically, Dr. Lipton will serve as research mentor for New Investigators and Early Stage
Investigators (NI/ESI) in AD/ADRD drug discovery. To date, virtually all AD/ADRD therapeutics evaluated in
human clinical trials have so far failed to show disease-modifying effects for AD/ADRD. For example, the lack
of significant efficacy in clinical trials with Aβ-centered therapeutics to date demands a new paradigm for
development of effective AD therapeutics. To overcome these significant gaps in knowledge and to advance
therapies, improvements in the models and strategies by which AD/ADRD researchers function and execute
need to occur. One solution to this challenge is to unite the best basic scientists with training in neuroscience,
structural biology, bioinformatics and computational biology, with equally expert teams in the pharmaceutical
industry trained in high-throughput screening, assay development, medicinal chemistry, chemical biology and
pharmacology. With a collective and harmonized team along with significant mentoring efforts for junior faculty
(NI/ESI), the PI, Dr. Lipton, has initiated three major efforts to address this unmet medical need, which will be
carried out under the auspices of the current R35 Leadership Award application:
 · Investigation, identification and characterization of potential AD/ADRD therapeutic targets in the context
 of the central pathophysiological processes in AD/ADRD.
 · Execution of drug discovery campaigns to develop investigational new drug (IND) clinical candidates
 iteratively with the target elucidation efforts, while building upon Scripps drug discovery infrastructure to
 accomplish this.
 · Continue to mentor junior faculty and build a world-class graduate school around the chemical biology
 of drug design for AD/ADRD at Scripps (currently ranked #2 by US News for Biochemistry)."

 This award is a four-year plan to support Ambrose Wong, MD, MSEd, an emergency physician, in his
transition towards an independent research career that focuses on dissemination and implementation of
services for mental health crises in general, non-psychiatric emergency settings. The long-term goal of his
research is to improve safety related to symptoms of agitation. To date, Dr. Wong's training has focused on
emergency medicine, qualitative methods, and education-based interventions. Under a team of co-mentors
with expertise in biostatistics, psychiatric services research, health informatics, and clinical trial implementation,
Dr. Wong will build on his preliminary work on agitation prevention and management to accomplish the
following training goals: (1) acquire expertise in clinical prediction modeling, (2) gain foundational knowledge in
preventing, treating, and investigating mental health crises, (3) study health informatics and development of
clinical support tools, and (4) obtain fundamental skills in clinical trials. The application integrates formal
coursework and training through mentored research activities.
 Behavioral conditions in acute care settings are rapidly rising in the U.S., with a 50% increase in number of
general emergency department (ED) visits for mental health conditions over the past decade. Agitation,
defined as excessive psychomotor activity leading to violent behavior, is often part of these patient encounters.
Of the 1.7 million agitation episodes occurring annually in general EDs, 83% are associated with an underlying
serious mental illness. Given the safety risks of agitation, clinicians commonly use physical restraint, which are
associated with up to 37% risk of complications including traumatic injuries and even sudden death in patients.
Thus, regulatory bodies and experts emphasize early risk assessment and use of behavioral techniques before
agitation occurs. However, variability in practice and policy of these techniques exists in emergency settings.
This is due to lack of knowledge regarding specific risk factors that predict the need for pre-emptive
intervention and challenges in assessing these risk factors in the busy environment of an ED. The objective of
this project is to develop and test the Early Detection and Treatment to Reduce Events with Agitation Tool (ED-
TREAT), a clinical decision support system embedded in the electronic health record that will guide clinicians
in early risk assessment and appropriate treatment of mental health patients likely to develop agitation. We will
first derive a clinical model using health record data and preliminary analyses by our team that predicts which
at-risk patients will develop agitation and require use of physical restraint. Next, we will develop and refine ED-
TREAT through user-centered design techniques with clinicians and patients. Finally, we will conduct a pilot
trial to test the feasibility, fidelity, and bedside acceptability of ED-TREAT. Aligned with NIMH's strategic
priorities to use technology for improving mental health delivery in non-specialty settings, this study will form
the basis for a subsequent full-scale clinical trial to examine ED-TREAT's effect on clinical outcomes."

The purpose of the Developmental Research Program (DRP) in the Mayo Clinic SPORE in Ovarian Cancer is
to support innovative, scientifically sound research projects from which findings can be translated into clinically
relevant interventions that will reduce the burden of ovarian cancer. This program has been highly successful,
with support going to 38 DRP projects in Years 6-10. Among the DRP project teams, 21 (11 funded in Years 1-
5 and 10 funded in Years 6-10) have received additional funding outside of the SPORE in Years 6-10 based on
their DRP project and 5 provided data instrumental for the selection of the full research projects in this renewal.
In our second funding period, the DRP generated 74 associated publications and contributed to 7 SPORE-
associated clinical trials. We will build on the successes of our SPORE DRP, which has attracted investigators
new to ovarian cancer research who ultimately became co-Leaders or co-Investigators of full Projects included
in this SPORE application, Core co-Leaders, or were awarded NIH funding outside of the SPORE. The DRP
will 1) foster innovative laboratory, population, and clinical study proposals that have strong translational
potential; 2) encourage and support interdisciplinary collaboration in translational research in ovarian cancer;
and 3) generate new hypotheses that can be tested in larger scale research projects or clinical trials in ovarian
cancer. The DRP will provide $200,000 annually ($100,000 from the SPORE and a matching $100,000 from
Mayo Clinic) to support at least 4 meritorious projects with $50,000 each to be used within one year. In
addition, between August 2014 and July 2020 we raised philanthropic support for ovarian cancer research at
Mayo Clinic that supported 18 DRP awards above and beyond the 20 originally projected during Years 6-10;
and we will continue to seek additional support for ovarian cancer research in the years to come. Depending
on the progress of any given project, the possibility of a second year of support exists via competitive review of
both new and continuation projects. The DRP will continue to utilize a defined process to call for applications
on an annual basis and to review submissions, utilizing the expertise of the Internal Scientific Advisory
Committee, Executive Committee, Patient Advocacy Advisory Committee, and other experienced investigators
as needed. Criteria for DRP awards include: The likelihood that the work will impact major challenges in
ovarian cancer, scientific merit, originality, translational potential, qualifications of the key personnel, and
interactivity. As experienced in our second funding period, it is anticipated that support of DRP projects through
this program will generate new hypotheses that progress to full SPORE translational projects or to peer-
reviewed external grant support."

This proposal aims to determine whether LXRα phosphorylation at serine 196 (S196) is a possible target for
therapeutic intervention in MRSA. Our previous published studies demonstrated in cultured cells and mouse
models of cardiometabolic diseases that the non-phosphorylated form of LXRα S196A reprograms the LXR-
modulated transcriptome and produces a more robust anti-inflammatory response. We hypothesize that reducing
LXRα phosphorylation in myeloid and endothelial cells would reduce MRSA pathology via resistance to MRSA
toxin-mediated killing via enhanced exosome release.
To test this, we will develop a mouse model that harbors either myeloid or endothelial cell-specific LXRα S196A
knock-in mice and compare the mortality and exosome abundance in the blood upon MRSA infection to that of WT
LXRα mice and global LXRα S196A mice. We will also generate primary macrophages and endothelial cells from
wild-type and LXRα S196A mice and measure effects on gene expression upon infection with MRSA to reveal
genes and pathways modulated by LXRα S196 phosphorylation that can be manipulated for preventive and
therapeutic purposes. We will also test whether pharmacological interventions that promote the non-
phosphorylated form of the wild-type LXRα can protect wild-type mice and human PBMCs from lethal MRSA
infection. Successful completion of the aims will determine whether LXRα phosphorylation represents a tractable
target for treating MRSA due to its ability to reduce inflammatory gene expression."

Inhibition of oncogenic KRAS is a highly pursued goal in drug discovery efforts, as RAS mutations are found in
~25% of human cancers. One key oncogenic KRAS mutation (KRASG12C) contains a reactive cysteine at a
hotspot location, is the fourth most prevalent mutation in KRAS-driven tumors and is found at particularly high
frequency (40% of RAS mutations, 13% overall) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Excitement has
accelerated rapidly around the discovery and application of covalent, Cys12-specific inhibitors of KRASG12C in
recent years as these compounds have shown efficacy in advanced clinical trials, with Sotorasib (AMG510,
LUMAKRAS™) recently receiving FDA approval for treatment of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC.
However, the kinetic mechanisms underlying the activity of this class of inhibitors remain poorly understood
impeding rational drug design efforts. To address this gap in knowledge, we developed a new fluorescence-
based approach to kinetically characterize the reactions of the proteins with these acrylamide-based inhibitors.
Intriguingly, we find that the two clinical compounds, AMG510 (Amgen) and MRTX849/Adagrasib (Mirati
Therapeutics) possess distinctly different kinetic properties, which we propose to investigate in further detail
here. Recognizing the oxidative environment promoted by oncogenic KRAS signaling and tumorigenesis, we
also evaluated the redox sensitivity and oxidative status in cells and found that Cys12 of KRASG12C is prone to
oxidation. Moreover, oxidation at this site prevents inhibitor attachment, suggesting that redox modification of
KRASG12C may constitute a mechanism of resistance to AMG510 and other covalent inhibitors. Other
unanswered questions remain in the field, including the propensity of the protein-drug adducts to undergo
chemical reversibility of the Michael addition reactions through which they bind, and how this could be affected
by altered acrylamide “warheads”. Aim 1 proposes structural and kinetic studies combined with computational
modeling and molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the differential mechanisms of KRASG12C inhibitor
engagement, inactivation and reversal. As development of treatment resistance remains a significant hurdle for
targeted inhibition strategies, Aims 2 and 3 propose to investigate the linkage between the redox sensitivity of
KRASG12C and inhibitor efficacy by measuring functional, signaling-relevant outputs for recombinant proteins and
biological samples (lung cancer cell lines and patient-derived organoids). For Aim 2, lung cancer cells under
variably oxidizing conditions, with and without inhibitor present, will be assessed for KRASG12C modifications and
downstream signaling outputs; use of HyPer-DAAO genetic constructs with targeting to the plasma membrane
will allow spatiotemporal and dosage control over hydrogen peroxide production within cells, near KRASG12C. In
Aim 3, the relationship between tumor redox properties and inhibitor efficacy will be investigated using fresh
NSCLC tumor specimens carrying KRASG12C mutations. Cumulatively, the results will provide improved under-
standing of the drugs and will serve as a platform for characterizing and developing future direct KRAS inhibitors."

The Cas9 platform has enabled genome editing, base editing (BE), and prime editing to induce gene
knockouts as well as tailor-made sequence alterations. CRISPR-Cas9 systems have the potential to similarly
revolutionize clinical practice through precise editing of disease loci. We have developed Nme2Cas9 as an
editing platform with (1) compact size, facilitating single adeno-associated virus (AAV) delivery; (2) a
dinucleotide (N4CC) protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) that affords high target site density; and (3) exceptional
accuracy. More recently, we developed Nme2Cas9 adenine base editor (ABE) systems as among the first to
be validated in vivo for single-AAV delivery. AAV is a potent editing delivery modality in vivo, especially in
extrahepatic tissues such as the central nervous system (CNS). Nonetheless, the therapeutic promise of base
editing systems will hinge upon improving editing efficiency, limiting bystander edits (or their consequences),
maximizing PAM-dependent targeting scope, and minimizing immunogenicity, toxicity, and prolonged
deaminase expression (which can compromise editing efficiency and lead to safety risks such as hepatotoxicity
and the accumulation of unwanted edits). Here we propose to capitalize on our establishment of single-vector
Nme2-ABE systems to develop novel base editing capabilities with increased effectiveness, targeting scope,
utility, and safety, and to validate these systems in the treatment of CNS disease models in mice. The goals of
this proposal are (1) to develop next-generation, single-AAV, deaminase-inlaid Nme2-ABEs and guides with
increased efficiency, a single-nucleotide PAM, and greater control over bystander editing; (2) to use next-
generation, single-AAV Nme2-ABE systems for therapeutic editing of disease genes in the CNS of mouse
models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Batten disease; and (3) to develop systems that use repression by
endogenous microRNAs and drug-dependent splicing systems to enhance the safety of AAV-delivered Nme2-
ABE in vivo. These safety enhancements will reduce anti-Nme2-ABE immune responses, ameliorate potential
toxic effects on the liver and on specific CNS cell types, and limit the off-target mutagenesis that can arise from
sustained expression of the editing machinery. Successful completion of these aims will provide invaluable
enhancements to the delivery, efficacy, and specificity of in vivo genome editing."

Hundreds of thousands of distant-acting enhancers control the function of the human genome by orchestrating
the transcription of genes during pre- and postnatal development and in normal and disease states of cells and

there is now abundant indirect evidence that sequence changes in enhancers are likely to impact substantially
on human phenotypic variation and many disease processes, our understanding of how biological function is
encoded within enhancer sequences remains incomplete. This represents a major challenge for the
interpretation of variation in enhancer sequences observed by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in patients and
for linking sequence variants within enhancers to diseases and other phenotypes. Over the past 16 years, the
research program supported by this R01 has provided major insights into enhancer biology and groundbreaking
tools for enhancer discovery and characterization. This included the first demonstration of ChIP-seq from
mammalian tissues for enhancer discovery, and a constantly evolving suite of mouse engineering methods for
studying enhancers in vivo. This program has also produced the largest cohesive collection of human and mouse
in vivo-characterized enhancers available to date and provides the VISTA Enhancer Browser as a major
community resource. In the next phase of this research program, we propose to leverage the unique capabilities
previously developed under this program to further advance our understanding of general enhancer biology, to
complement the work of the recently established NHGRI Impact of Genomic Variation on Function (IGVF)
consortium with critically needed in vivo assessments of enhancer variants, and to provide enhancer resources
for the extended community. Our specific aims include: (1) We will explore the inner anatomy of enhancer
sequences through large-scale mutagenesis coupled to in vivo mouse assays. We will also delete large non-
coding genome intervals (gene deserts) from the mouse genome to determine the broad functional significance
of non-coding DNA beyond individual enhancer elements. (2) Working as Affiliates with the IGVF Consortium,
we will perform large-scale in vivo exploration of human variants with predicted impact on enhancer function to
assess human variation/mutation through our unique mouse engineering capabilities. This will include careful
validation and calibration of massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) and CRISPR screens through
comparison with in vivo mouse reporter assays. (3) We will continue to provide access to in vivo mouse assays
for the community and make our results available through the VISTA Enhancer Browser. In combination, in the
next phase of this program we expect to deliver impactful insights into the biology of enhancers as a major
category of non-coding genome function, apply innovative tools to demonstrate the in vivo impact of variants
identified by the IGVF consortium, and continue to make unique enhancer analysis tools and resources available
to the broader community."
10894908,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in up to 20% of hospitalized patients and is associated with increased risk of
readmission, morbidity, and mortality. The estimated annual cost of AKI care in the US is over 10 billion dollars,
and, with the incidence rising, these costs will continue to increase. The current gold standards for diagnosing
AKI, creatinine and urine output, are often delayed in their recognition of tubular injury. Prior work on AKI has
typically focused on patients who have already developed AKI based on these standards, and interventions at
this late time point have had mixed success. In contrast, emerging data suggest that intervening earlier can
improve outcomes. Therefore, it is critical to optimize the early detection of AKI in hospitalized patients.
 We have previously developed a machine learning tool to identify patients at high risk of severe (stage 2
or greater) AKI more than a day earlier than clinically apparent using structured electronic health record (EHR)
data. Although more accurate than prior methods, it suffers from a high rate of false positives, which limits its
value in clinical practice. There is a large amount of valuable information that is stored in unstructured free-text
fields (e.g., clinical notes) that could be utilized using natural language processing (NLP) within advanced deep
learning neural network models that could significantly improve the detection of early AKI. Furthermore, there
are established and emerging kidney injury biomarkers that could be combined with EHR-based models to
improve accuracy even further. Finally, it remains unclear what interventions will have the best chance of
decreasing the risk for developing severe AKI in high-risk patients. A better understanding of which interventions
are of greatest benefit to specific patients is critical for improving the outcomes of patients at risk of AKI.
 The objective of this project is to develop novel tools to improve the identification and treatment of patients
at high risk of AKI using a large, multicenter cohort. In Aim 1, we will use NLP and deep learning algorithms to
develop a model to predict severe AKI across four health systems. In Aim 2, we will silently run the best-
performing model developed in Aim 1 in real-time to identify high-risk patients. Manual retrospective chart review
will be performed on a cohort of the highest risk patients to determine both the proportion of patients who receive
guideline-based care as well as the association between receipt of guideline-based care and outcomes. We will
also identify novel phenotypes of patients who are particularly helped or harmed by specific guideline-based
interventions. Finally, in Aim 3, we will collect kidney injury biomarkers in the highest-risk patients to determine
the added value of biomarkers to EHR-based models alone. Our proposal will provide clinicians with new tools
to identify patients at risk of AKI earlier and more accurately. It will also provide evidence for which interventions
are most likely to improve patient outcomes. This will result in earlier, more personalized care for patients at high
risk of AKI, which will lead to decreased costs, morbidity, and mortality."

10896332,"Project Summary / Abstract
Urban children with asthma are at high risk for short sleep, due to an environment that jeopardizes sleep and
asthma management. Further, this group suffers from altered immune balance, a key biological process
contributing to individual differences in asthma morbidity and sleep health. Allergic asthma is a chronic
inflammatory disorder driven primarily by disturbed T helper 1 (Th1)/ 2 (Th2) cytokine balance marked by Th2
cytokine (IL-4, IL-5 and/or IL-13) predominance. Experimental findings in healthy adults show that shortened
sleep increases inflammatory cytokine (e.g., IL-6) and certain Th2 cytokine levels and that recovery sleep
following sleep restriction promotes a return to immune balance. Whether sleep duration plays a key role in
immune function and associated asthma activity in urban children with asthma remains a scientific gap. We will
use an experimental design that targets sleep duration, because (1) the urban environment and asthma
symptoms interact to shorten sleep, (2) sleep duration is a modifiable behavior overlooked in clinical care of
urban children with asthma, and (3) experimental data are critical to test a causal link for sleep duration as a
mechanism underlying immune balance and asthma.
 We will enroll urban children (N=204; ages 8-9 years) with persistent allergic asthma and adequate sleep
duration (9-11 h) who will complete a 4-week within-subjects protocol that includes 3 scheduled experimental
sleep conditions: (1) 1 week stabilized sleep (individualized; 9-11 h time in bed), (2) 1 week shortened sleep
(1.5 h decrease in time in bed), and (3) 2 weeks recovery sleep (1.5 h increase in time in bed). We will monitor
sleep duration (actigraphy) and lung function (home spirometry) daily and assess immune biomarkers weekly
and at the midpoint of shortened sleep. To control time-in-study effects, 1/3 of our sample will receive only the
stabilized sleep schedule across the 4-week protocol. In this project, we will study only urban children with
allergic asthma who obtain sufficient sleep (9-11 h, within national guidelines). Our shortened sleep protocol
will model the sleep loss that urban children with asthma can experience due to asthma and/or urban context.
Additionally, our recovery sleep protocol simulates a sleep optimization intervention following shortened sleep
in a well-controlled approach.
 The first aim of the study is to examine the effects of shortened sleep on immune balance [e.g., Th1
(Interferon-IFNγ)/Th2 (Interleukin-IL-4, IL-5, IL-13)R and plasma IL-6 levels]. The second aim involves
determining the effects of recovery sleep on immune balance. The third aim involves examining the extent to
which changes in immune balance are associated with changes in asthma-related lung function (changes in
FEV1) under conditions of shortened and recovery sleep. Results from this study ultimately will support the
development feasible, ecologically valid, and clinically meaningful interventions to optimize sleep duration,
immune balance, and asthma in this at-risk group."
10895384,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 The goal of this proposal is to advance neural models of major depressive disorder (MDD). Prior studies of
MDD and related conditions have relied on group-level information when making inferences about individual
brains, and have yielded limited translation and clinical impact. Such group-level approaches are limited given
robust evidence that the brain exhibits substantial individual variability in its organization. This proposal describes
a computational psychiatry approach rooted in new computational neuroimaging methods that will provide
improved detail in mapping the brains of individuals with MDD, including in relation to diagnostic status, symptom
and behavioral profiles, and predicting treatment response.
 More specifically, the team proposes an advanced fMRI-based brain mapping approach that will be used to
deeply characterize the rich organizational structure of functional brain systems at the level of individuals
(yielding “individualized brain systems”). The proposed research will be completed by leveraging over 700
existing datasets acquired through data sharing. This proposal is feasible, in part due, to data sharing and the
strong theoretical and methodological foundations provided by the PI and the team’s prior research. MDD is a
particularly promising focus for this proposal given that it is (1) highly heterogeneous and thus an ideal target for
mapping individual variability; (2) highly prevalent and the leading contributor to global disease burden; and that
(3) fewer than one in three MDD patients remit after treatment.
 The Specific Aims of this proposal are to: (1) Map individualized brain systems in MDD; (2) Characterize
relations between individualized brain systems and core MDD symptoms and behavioral deficits; and, finally, to
(3) Explicate predictive relations between individualized brain systems and MDD clinical trial outcomes to three
mechanistically distinct treatments. In addition to theory-driven studies, this proposal includes the development
of a complementary data-driven machine learning approach that will use only individualized brain system
features to make clinically meaningful predictions about specific patients. This will include predicting diagnostic
status, symptom and behavioral profiles, and treatment outcomes.
 Precision medicine has considerably impacted several medical fields, including cardiology and oncology. We
have yet to see similar developments in psychiatry, given, in part, due to the challenge of mapping relations
among clinical features of mental illness and the brain. The development of computational neuroimaging
approaches, including those in the current proposal, now provide new opportunities to address this challenge
and translational gap."

South-Central Texas is home to San Antonio and Austin, both among the nation’s
fastest growing cities. San Antonio, the gateway to South Texas, is the 7th largest city and the largest minority-
majority Hispanic/Latino city in the US, whereas Austin is 11th largest. The region also includes many rural
counties and several on the US-Mexico border. Given our demographics and rapid growth, our area foreshadows
future challenges facing US healthcare, underscoring the national applicability of solutions devised by our hub.
In 2006, UT Health Science Center San Antonio established the Institute for Integration of Medicine &
Science (IIMS) as the academic home for translational research initiatives, training the translational science
workforce, formalizing key strategic partnerships, and creating a community of scholars within a learning
healthcare system. Building upon our optimized clinical and translational research infrastructure, IIMS now
proposes a 4th cycle of CTSA support in response to PAR-21-293. Our hub seeks to be exceptional in solving
clinical and translational science (CTS) roadblocks, translating discoveries into reduced disparities and improved
healthcare outcomes across our multi-cultural population. We strive to make our vision a reality through robust
strategies for supporting CTS across institutional partners and collaborating organizations, catalyzing successes
for transdisciplinary research teams, and implementing programs that produce a creative, collaborative, and
culturally diverse translational science workforce. We will achieve our goals through the strategic deployment of
resources and expertise developed during 3 cycles of CTSA funding. Our proposal leverages optimized strengths
across the spectrum of clinical and translational research to establish the capacity and infrastructure required for
high-impact CTS programs. Thus, IIMS will pivot from the study of specific targets/diseases (i.e., clinical
translational research) to the discovery of generalizable principles that apply to many targets/diseases (CTS),
addressing rate-limiting steps and transforming translation from an empirical process into a predictive science.
This guiding tenet is embedded within each Element and Module of this proposal, as well as across our pipeline
of training and workforce development programs. We posit that synergies across hub partners will yield CTS
innovations and contribute meaningfully to the National CTSA Consortium. Our over-arching Specific Aims are:
 1. Catalyze the acceleration of CTS discovery and health disparities impact within a vibrant academic home
 synergistically integrated with our strategic partners and actively engaged with our diverse communities
 2. Capitalize on our extraordinary Hispanic and military/veteran population base to diversify and enhance
 our interdisciplinary clinical and translational science workforce
 3. Implement innovative strategies for evaluation and continuous improvement across all IIMS programs
 4. Focus strategically on dissemination and implementation of evidence-based CTS advances with high
 potential for advancing health equity, both regionally and across the National CTSA Consortium"
10813044,"This application is to support Dr. Lauren Ashley Cowart, PhD as a VA Research Career Scientist. Dr. Cowart
has been VA funded since 2005 and has served as PI on 2 NIH R01 awards (currently funded through 2025),
among other intra- and extramural support. Dr. Cowart began her independent career at the Ralph H. Johnson
VAMC and its academic affiliate, the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC). While there she developed
a robust research program with both NIH and VA support addressing the contribution of bioactive sphingolipids
to obesity-related disease. These studies included seminal work on how different fatty acids (e.g unsaturated,
saturated, etc.) modified sphingolipid metabolism in cells, and how aberrant production of sphingolipids led to
inflammation, maladaptive autophagy, oxidative stress, and other deleterious programs. These studies were
conducted in a variety of organs and tissues including skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, liver, and adipose tissue.
The research environment at Ralph H. Johnson VAMC was very rich, and while there she published over 40
manuscripts including 8 with prominent VA collaborators. From 2005-2017 Dr. Cowart advanced from a research
track Assistant Professor to a tenured Associate Professor. In 2017, Dr. Cowart moved to the Hunter Holmes
McGuire VAMC whose academic affiliate is Virginia Commonwealth University. She immediately connected with
Dr. Edward Lesnefsky, a VA cardiologist who serves co-investigator on her recent VA Merit award, and with
whom she has active research projects and publications in preparation. Recently she has developed projects
with investigators at other VAMCs including Dr. Abhinav Diwan in St. Louis (John Cochran VAMC/Wash. U.),
which has resulted in several grant applications and manuscripts in preparation, and Dr. Sushil Mahata in San
Diego (VA San Diego Healthcare System/UCSD), with whom she has two manuscripts in development and has
been actively applying for both NIH and VA funding (through the collaborative Merit program). While the scale of
the basic science research enterprise at Hunter Holmes McGuire is narrower than at Ralph H. Johnson, she
continues to seek out and forge new collaborations within the local VA and national VA research community.
 Dr. Cowart’s research addresses the constellation of metabolic diseases: type 2 diabetes, obesity,
metabolic syndrome, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. In this context her work addresses molecular
mechanisms by which sphingolipids regulate adipose tissue function, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD),
and myocardial dysfunction. Major published findings include that saturated vs. unsaturated fatty acids
differentially regulate enzymes including sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) that produce the sphingolipid mediators
sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and ceramide, and that sphingosine-1-phosphate mediates NAFLD. These
findings led her to develop cell-specific knock outs of SphK1. Surprisingly, the adipocyte-specific SphK1 mouse
demonstrated a basal diabetes-like phenotype, indicating a beneficial, homeostatic role for SphK1 in adipocytes.
Furthermore, in liver, while depletion of SphK1 in hepatocytes partially attenuated inflammation in NAFLD,
female mice, and not males, developed an exacerbated fibrotic phenotype, which led to the discovery that
estrogen-induced release of S1P from hepatocytes had an anti-fibrotic effect on hepatic stellate cells. While
using mice on obesogenic diets for other studies, her group discovered that inhibition of sphingolipid biosynthesis
prevented mice from developing cardiac hypertrophy and features of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Further
mechanistic studies in cells showed that specifically, Ceramide Synthase 5 mediated maladaptive autophagy,
and in contrast Ceramide Synthase 2 mediated ROS production and mitophagy. These highly cited manuscripts
reflect the first work that has dissected the complexities of sphingolipid synthesis in heart disease to reveal
distinct pathways that underlie pathology. These established studies have laid a foundation for current work
further addressing bioactive sphingolipids in obesity-related pathology, alcoholic liver disease, and lipid
biomarker discovery. This award will provide stability and continuity as she continues to develop her research."

 The Systems Marketing Analysis for Research Translation (SMART) Innovation Program brings a cutting-
edge set of tools together to improve clinical and translational research effectiveness, efficiency, and equity
and thereby enhance public health and health care delivery. The SMART Innovation Program supports CTSA
Program Goals by (1) developing, demonstrating, and disseminating an operational innovation that improves
the efficiency and effectiveness of clinical translational, (2) a structured, participatory method for promoting
partnerships and collaborations to facilitate and accelerate translational research projects local, regionally, and
nationally, and (3) creating and providing this with an explicit emphasis on addressing health disparities and
deliver the benefits of translational science to all. More specifically, we build on our collective prior experience
and collaboration combining community based-system dynamics as a participatory method for selection and
tailoring of implementation strategies with a social marketing approach within a novel set-based concurrent
engineering approach borrowed from manufacturing to accelerate translational research and health equity. Our
primary hypothesis is that the integration of participatory system dynamics modeling with social marketing
analysis improves clinical and translational research effectiveness, efficiency, and equity by reducing the
complexity of translational research.
 The SMART Innovation program is designed to work with clinical researchers at any stage of the
translational research continuum with an emphasis on the design of implementation strategies that maximize
implementation outcomes of fidelity, reach, and sustainability of clinical interventions to promote health equity.
More specifically, the SMART Innovation program begins with market analysis of the end user of the innovation
(e.g., patient in the case of medication adherence, provider in the case of suicide screening and referral) to
characterize the initial distribution of “demand” for the clinical innovation and its potential impact on reducing
health inequities. This preliminary analysis provides the basis for a 2.5-day participatory group model building
workshop with clinical researchers, implementation researchers, and end-users (or proxies, e.g., a patient
navigator, advocate) to conceptualize the implementation context as a system, select and tailor implementation
strategies, and refine an implementation. The program then supports the refinement of the analysis through a
second phase of marketing analysis, leading to a more efficient translation of clinical and community
innovations to improve health outcomes and health equity."

The mission of The University of Chicago (UChicago) Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) is to train the
next generation of clinician-scientists for impactful careers in the biomedical sciences. Impact is broadly
defined as: providing fundamental insights into disease and relevant biological mechanisms, leading or making
substantial contributions to translational efforts to identify better therapies and/or filling leadership roles that will
determine how limited resources can best be used to improve human health. Our overall objective is to train
outstanding and self-directed clinician scientists who can formulate and answer biologically and medically-
important questions. To ensure the greatest impact, our program must reflect the diversity of the U.S.
population in both who it trains and who it serves. To accomplish our mission and overall objective, we defined
15 specific and measurable objectives that stress the technical, operational and professional skills that support
science identity and self-efficacy and are critical for a successful career as an independent biomedical
investigator. Two unique features of the program enable our mission and provide an optimal training
environment for the development of clinician-scientists. First, we are our own graduate program, the
Interdisciplinary Scientist Training Program (ISTP). The ISTP allows integration of graduate and medical
school classes in MS1, development of tailored curricula for each trainee, coordination across training
transitions and uniform oversight and expectations during the graduate phase. Second, most trainees pursue a
1-4-3 progression of study rather than the traditional 2-4-2 progression. While trainees may pursue a 2-4-2, the
1-4-3 provides a continuous and in-depth graduate experience where trainees become well-trained scientists
who can propose and rigorously test hypotheses. The 1-4-3 also provides a seamless transition between the
preclinical and clinical phases which facilitates overall success in medical school. Multiple programmatic
features ensure that fundamental scientific and clinical knowledge are interwoven to foster the development of
impactful clinician-scientists. The UChicago MSTP enjoys sustained and substantial University financial
backing including generous direct investment and support of facilities that cultivate innovative science. We are
requesting 25 training slots to supplement University investments to support trainees for six of the typical eight
years they spend in the MSTP. This requested investment by the NIH would constitute only 13% of total
anticipated cost for our MSTP. We anticipate a program size of approximately 80 trainees and expect, based
on our track record, that our trainees will contribute significantly to the U.S. biomedical enterprise."

10703837,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality and is especially prevalent among
US veterans. Heart failure (HF) is one of the most common manifestations of CVD, and one of the main
underlying pathologic mechanisms is cardiac fibrosis. Fibrosis is a reparative mechanism that follows any type
of injury. In the heart, it leads to reduced tissue compliance, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis,
chamber dilation, and eventually HF. HF patients undergoing implantation of a left ventricular assist device or
heart transplantation present a unique opportunity as cardiac tissue becomes available at the time of the above
operations. Our studies in HF patients have identified adipocyte enhancer binding protein 1 (AEBP1) as a
major node associated with myofibroblast activation, abnormal extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis, and
impaired wound healing following cardiac injury. Our goal is to investigate the mechanisms by which the
aberrant expression of AEBP1 contributes to cardiac fibrosis and to exploit its inhibition as a potential
antifibrotic therapy. Our recent studies indicated the correlation of elevated AEBP1 with increased cardiac
fibrosis and myofibroblast activation. The overexpression of AEBP1 in primary fibroblasts led to the
upregulation of myofibroblast markers and ECM. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing identified
Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) as a potential transcription factor regulating AEBP1 expression.
We will investigate the mechanisms by which RUNX1 regulates AEBP1 expression during cardiac
fibroblast activation and subsequent fibrosis development (Aim 1). We will perform manipulative
expression (overexpression or shRNA knockdown) of RUNX1 in conjunction with quantitative determination of
AEBP1 expression level. We will determine the cis regulatory element in the AEBP1 genomic region which
RUNX1 occupies during cardiac myofibroblast activation and fibrosis development following cardiac injury.
 Our previous studies have shown that the overexpression of AEBP1 in human primary fibroblasts is
associated with increased expression of RUNX1, mesenchyme homeobox (MEOX), and myocardin-related
transcription factor A (MRTF-A). The knockdown of AEBP1 in fibroblasts stimulated with transforming growth
factor beta (TGF-ß) led to a reduced expression of RUNX1, MEOX and MRTF-A. Our goal is to understand
the mechanistic involvement of RUNX1, MEOX, and MRTF-A in AEBP1-mediated cardiac fibrosis (Aim
2). By overexpressing RUNX1, MEOX, or MRTFA in primary fibroblasts we will identify the gene and protein
expression of myofibroblast markers and ECM in relation to AEBP1 expression and determine whether they
are downstream of AEBP1, suggesting a possible feedback loop mechanism. We will test if the knockdown of
RUNX1, MEOX, or MRTF-A in fibroblasts stimulated with TGF-ß will reduce myofibroblast activation and
fibrosis. In a mouse model of myocardial infarction (MI) and phenylephrine/angiotensin 2 (PE/ANGT)-induced
fibrosis, we will evaluate the protein expression of RUNX1 and MRTF-A, and if the knockdown of RUNX1 or
MEOX, or the expression of MRTF-A will attenuate myofibroblast activation and cardiac fibrosis.
 AEBP1 inhibition in mice undergoing MI or infusion of PE/ANGT led to a reduction in cardiac fibrosis
and myofibroblast activation, in our recent studies. Our goal is to determine the therapeutic antifibrotic
potential of inhibiting the AEBP1 pathway (Aim 3). Since AEBP1 is also implicated in wound healing, the
timing of intervention following organ injury will be critical in the development of such an antifibrotic therapy.
We will determine the optimal timepoint of intervention by evaluating cardiac function, histological changes,
myofibroblast markers, autophagy, and oxidative stress. Utilizing the novel long-term functional preservation of
human myocardium in vitro under continuous electromechanical stimulation (MyoDishTM), we can evaluate its
therapeutic potential. This novel technology can help us develop a proof of concept for the treatment of cardiac
fibrosis and avoid the limitations of animal models in recapitulating the chronicity and complexity of human HF."

Vaccination strategies for SARS-CoV-2 in young children have not yet fully incorporated their unique
immunologic profiles to ensure effective and durable protection. Children often present with milder SARS-CoV-
2 disease than adults but remain at risk for acute COVID-19 and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in
children (MIS-C). Roll out of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was markedly delayed in younger age groups, therefore
many young children have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 prior to vaccination. It is currently unknown if
young children with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection have differential responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination
compared to SARS-CoV-2 naïve children and if there is an optimal timing interval to increase durability of
protection. From in utero to early childhood to adulthood there is a gradual shift in immune responses from
tolerogenic to immunogenic. Infants have attenuated T and B cell responses to some vaccines compared to
adults, and often need multiple doses of primary vaccine series. We will leverage a highly-detailed cohort of
young children aged 6 months to 4 years old receiving early childhood SARS-CoV-2 immunization. We will use
high-dimensional antibody profiling and flow cytometry to perform a detailed characterization of SARS-CoV-2
vaccine-specific immune responses in young children. We hypothesize young children with prior SARS-CoV-2
infection will have more robust and durable SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular and antibody responses to SARS-
CoV-2 vaccination compared to previously uninfected. During the first year of life, maternally-derived
antibodies (MatAbs) are present in infants and provide partial protection against pathogens during this period
of immunologic vulnerability. However, the presence of MatAbs at the time of immunization in infants have
been shown to inhibit vaccine responses regardless of vaccination type or platform. Numerous mechanisms
have been proposed for this inhibition by MatAbs, including neutralization of vaccine antigen, epitope masking
of immunogenic epitopes, or differential Fc function and engagement of inhibitory receptors. Though it is
currently unknown if SARS-CoV-2 MatAbs impact infant immune responses. We hypothesize that the MatAbs
repertoire will preferentially contain neutralizing antibodies with persistence of SARS-CoV-2 epitope-specific
antibodies that will mask SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-specific responses in infants. Together these studies will
provide needed insight on SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-specific and hybrid immunity to optimize timing of primary
vaccination series including after SARS-CoV-2 infection and potential boosting for young children. Additionally,
detailed studies of the characterization and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 MatAbs repertoires will allow new
insights into mechanisms underlying protection against SARS-CoV-2 in early infancy and potential inhibition of
vaccine responses."
10893525,"Defining how cells regulate the uptake and efflux of transition metals such as Zn is a key component in
elucidating cellular mechanisms of metal homeostasis. Bacterial model systems provide paradigms for
understanding regulation mechanisms. In E. coli, the Zn2+-responsive metalloregulator ZntR senses Zn excess
and activates Zn efflux systems (e.g., ZntA), while Zur senses Zn sufficiency and represses Zn uptake systems
(e.g., ZnuABC), to keep this essential metal at appropriate physiological levels in the cell. Past research has
provided significant insights into the structure, function, and mechanism of the protein players in regulating
cellular metal concentrations, including metalloregulators, and metal uptake/efflux transporters, etc. Yet, many
mechanistic pathways are still poorly understood, especially regarding spatially and temporally coordinated
interactions among proteins and/or DNA that can reside at different locations in the cell. The long-term goal here
is to understand how metal regulation in the cell can be manipulated for preventive and therapeutic purposes.
Toward this goal, the PI has established an internationally recognized and unique research program that applies
and develops advanced single-molecule/single-cell imaging approaches to interrogate and understand the
mechanisms of bacterial metal regulation both in vitro and in live cells, which are further enhanced by bulk
biochemical/biophysical and protein/genetic engineering approaches and by established collaborations with
biologists and engineers. The research has led to the discoveries of first-of-their-kind mechanisms of metal-
responsive transcriptional regulation and metal efflux. The objective of this renewal is to advance the study and
understanding of bacterial metal regulation from single molecules and single cells toward cell communities,
comprising three aims that focus on Zn regulation in E. coli: (1) define a “through-DNA” mechanism for Zn uptake-
vs-efflux regulation; (2) define the mechanism of ZnuABC for Zn uptake in the cell; and (3) dissect cell-cell
interactions in Zn homeostasis within bacterial communities. The research is significant because it will provide
novel mechanistic insights into: how metalloregulators can act on each other on DNA, beyond the present
paradigm of “set-point” mechanism; the spatiotemporal coordination of multicomponent Zn transporters for Zn
uptake; and the cell-cell interactions in Zn homeostasis within a bottom-up cell community; and because these
insights will deepen our understanding of cell biology of metals in general, including related processes in human
cells, thus providing fundamental knowledge for identifying causes or developing preventions of diseases that
involve similar regulation processes or for devising strategies to impair bacterial Zn homeostasis for antimicrobial
treatments. The research is innovative because it generates novel mechanistic concepts in metal regulation,
uptake/efflux, and emergent behaviors in microbial communities and because it applies novel single-
molecule/cell imaging methods as well as microfluidic and optogenetic manipulations."

10910003,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Bacteria have a remarkable ability to sense diverse stimuli and make regulatory decisions to elicit an appropriate
response. The objective of our research program is to understand the molecular underpinnings of this cellular
decision-making process during the development of three dimensional (3D) structured communities called
biofilms. Biofilms represent a predominant bacterial lifestyle and are crucial for antimicrobial tolerance, virulence,
and environmental persistence in diverse pathogens including multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
P. aeruginosa serves as an ideal clinically relevant model system for our basic research in biofilms because it
adapts to and forms biofilms in a wide variety of environments, and the biofilm matrix components in this
organism are well characterized. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to define how bacteria decode
and integrate sensory cues – physical, chemical and biological – over the course of the biofilm development
cycle. My work has shown that light (physical cue) detected via bacteriophytochrome BphP photoreceptor
mediated photo sensing and population density (biological cue) detected via RhlR mediated quorum sensing
represses biofilms. Furthermore, we have discovered that nutrient availability (chemical cue) converges with
quorum sensing (biological cue) to control biofilm matrix components and architecture. Over the next five years,
we will build on our recent discoveries and use a multidisciplinary approach combining bacterial genetics,
molecular biology, biochemistry, fluorescence microscopy, mathematical modeling, structural biology and
genome-scale studies to define sensory signaling in the context of a growing biofilm. First, we will investigate
how light is perceived locally and globally in heterogenous biofilms and characterize the BphP photo-sensing
signaling system to understand the regulation of photo sensing in P. aeruginosa (Project 1). Second, we will
dissect the CbrA-Crc nutrient-sensing pathway to learn how nutrient availability controls biofilm development
(Project 2). Third, we will delineate the different ways by which RhlR mediated quorum sensing represses biofilm
formation (Project 3). Finally, we will define how information from two or more distinct sensory signaling pathways
are combined in the control of collective behaviors (Project 4). Our research will establish a broadly relevant
framework for understanding how information encoded in diverse sensory inputs is extracted and integrated to
drive collective behaviors – knowledge that is crucial for designing successful synthetic strategies to enhance or
to inhibit biofilms and for developing novel therapeutic interventions."

carcinoma (OCSCC). Prognostic biomarkers are critically needed to determine patients with oral
dysplastic lesions at risk for malignant transformation and to guide the targeted development of novel
therapies. Our goal is to establish a single-cell atlas of premalignant immune microenvironment (PRIME)
in oral dysplasia and to identify immune features that predict the malignant transformation to OCSCC.
We propose an innovative approach that combines high-dimensional imaging mass cytometry (IMC) and
machine learning predictive modeling (iEN) to analyze a total of ~200 Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded
(FFPE) patient tongue biopsies from the Oral Pathology Archive at the University of the Pacific (UOP),
Arthur A. Dugoni School of Dentistry. IMC is a new multiplex imaging technology which combines high-
dimensional mass cytometry with microscopy. Immune Elastic Net (iEN) is a machine learning algorithm
specifically developing for the analysis of high-dimensional mass cytometry data. We plan to identify
immune features that differentiate oral dysplasia severity (Aim 1) and predict OCSCC malignant
transformation (Aim 2). In addition, we will analyze the iEN-selected immune features at UOP Han’s lab
by conducting multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) staining on the whole sections (Aim 1&2) to validate
and generalize the IMC findings. The proposed research will establish immune landscape in oral
dysplasia and identify biomarkers to predict the malignant transformation. It also provides an opportunity
for predental or dental students participating in translational research and collaborating with
multidisciplinary team to identify biomarkers to improve oral pathology diagnosis."
10917170,"Project Summary/Abstract
The primary goal of this research proposal is to develop general and efﬁcient Bayesian statistical methods to
enhance drug discovery using complex clinical trial data. Rapid development in biomedical sciences is generat-
ing increasingly large and heterogeneous health-related data, including toxicity and efﬁcacy endpoints, long-term
survival time, and surrogate biomarker proﬁle. Although the data are heterogeneous by nature, they serve the
same central drug discovery question and multiple types of outcomes may be collected from the same individ-
ual. Therefore, a successful information integration of these “big data” generated during different periods of
complex clinical trials can improve the power of the hypothesis testing, speed the drug discovery process, and
enhance the individual ethics of the trials, among other beneﬁts. However, signiﬁcant efforts are needed to mit-
igate the gaps of the data generated from different platforms; otherwise, the accumulated inconsistencies and
biases may distort the statistical inference for complex clinical trials. We will tackle this important and challenging
research topic by developing a series of novel Bayesian statistical methods. In particular, we will (1) develop a
jointly modeling approach using the patient-derived organoids (PDO) and the paired clinical outcome to select
and verify personalized medicine (2) construct a Bayesian subgroup-speciﬁc dose optimization model to synthe-
size risk-beneﬁt evidence across multi-dimensional heterogeneous data and (3) develop a Bayesian calibrated
network meta-analysis method to integrate the control information of master protocol trials during different ran-
domization stages. In addition, we will develop user-friendly web apps to facilitate the widespread application
of the proposed methods in clinical practice. All the aims in this proposal are driven by practical issues from
complex clinical trials. The proposed research are general and encompasses a variety of clinical trial settings,
including oncology and vaccine trials, phase I, II, and III trials, standard and master protocol trials, long-term
and short-term outcomes, and surrogate marker. The preliminary results show that the proposed methods can
substantially reduce the bias of the data and yield highly efﬁcient and reliable performances, compared with other
existing methods."
10918189,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Children’s screen media use has increased dramatically in recent years. Greater screen use, especially during
the evening hours, is routinely, though not unequivocally, associated with disruption of sleep including shorter
sleep duration, difficulty falling asleep, and reduced overall sleep quality. Based in a wealth of research showing
poor sleep health in childhood to robustly forecast a wide range of adverse outcomes (e.g., obesity, psychiatric
disorders, poor cognitive and academic performance, emotion dysregulation, increased risk-taking behaviors,
suicidality), current guidelines provided by virtually every major pediatric health organization/association
recommend that children avoid use of electronic screens in the hour before bed. While perhaps intuitive,
empirical evidence to support this guideline is largely cross-sectional. That is, causal effects of evening screen
use on children’s sleep and circadian timing have not been sufficiently demonstrated nor have the mechanism(s)
through which sleep disruption may occur been clarified. Experimental studies are therefore necessary to provide
professionals and parents with evidence-based guidance and inform developmental research. The goal of the
current study is to systematically test the impact of light exposure from screens as well as arousing media content
on N=200 school-aged children’s (8 to 11 years) sleep regulation and circadian timing, in addition to next-day
emotion regulation and executive functioning. Our novel ability to objectively assess and account for children’s
daytime tablet use history will allow us to accurately isolate the effects of evening screen use on children’s sleep.
Using a 4-group randomized, controlled design including assessment of typical sleep and media use followed
by a 3-day experimental protocol, we plan to: 1) systematically test the effects of evening screen media use in
the natural home environment on children’s sleep duration, sleep latency, and subjective sleep quality; 2)
translate experimental research methods from the laboratory to the home environment to examine the impact of
bright light emitted from screens and exposure to arousing media content on children’s sleep, circadian
physiology, and physiological arousal; 3) examine the role of evening screen use on children’s next day executive
functioning and emotion regulation. The proposed research addresses several critical gaps in scientific
knowledge regarding the impact of evening screen media use on children’s sleep health, including elucidating
the specific mechanism(s) through which potential negative impacts may occur. Results may directly inform
national guidelines and policies regarding evening screen media use in all children."
10911929,"Beyond their prevalence in everyday life, many plant terpenoids have life-saving medicinal applications for a
variety of human diseases. Despite their clear medicinal importance, it remains unclear how plants synthesize
most plant terpneoids. This knowledge gap prevents us from developing a better method to access terpenoids
since medicinal terpenoids are extracted from plants with meager yields. This research program aims to
accelerate the identification of plant terpenoid biosynthetic pathways and to improve plant terpenoid production
in microbes. Synthesizing plant terpenoids in microbes is a far more cost-effective approach as it can significantly
enhance terpenoid productivity and shorten production time. We developed an integrated workflow capable of
high-throughput characterization of multiple plant terpenoid pathways in parallel. This workflow combines
genomic mining, transcriptomic analysis, metabolomics, and biochemical assays for terpenoid pathway
elucidation followed by pathway reconstitution in engineered microbes for high-titer terpenoid production. Our
workflow is unique in that it includes gene clusters in plant genomes as an untapped source for uncovering novel
plant biosynthetic pathways. Another unique feature of our workflow is that we use a highly engineered yeast
strain as a platform to produce plant specialized terpenoids. This highly productive platform strain sets the stage
for cost-effective production of any of the >80,000 terpenoids and infinite numbers of terpenoid analogs. In this
research program, we will apply this workflow to decipher multiple plant terpenoid pathways, including valuable
mono-, di-, sesqui-, tri-, and tetra-terpenoid synthetic routes in foxglove, millet, crocus, and other plant species.
Progress from the proposed work will advance fundamental knowledge regarding how plants synthesize
medicinally important or biologically active terpenoids. It will also transform the biomanufacturing of plant-based
medicines for renewable and cost-effective production."
10886082,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with acute impairments in cerebrovascular
pressure reactivity (CVPR); however, the course of recovery and implications for neurorecovery and functional
outcome with persistently impaired CVPR after the acute injury are unknown. To date, research into CVPR
impairments have focused on the pressure reactivity index (PRx), which requires invasive intracranial pressure
(ICP) and arterial blood pressure monitoring. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) has the potential to non-
invasively measure the pressure reactivity index (nPRx), allowing for assessment of CVPR outside the ICU.
Alterations in autonomic nervous system (ANS) function may contribute to CVPR abnormalities after moderate
to severe TBI. Cerebrovascular blood flow (CBF) is partially regulated through the balance of sympathetic
nervous system (SNS) and parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) activity. Clinical signs of SNS overactivity
are seen acutely after TBI, but long-term assessments with objective measures of SNS activity are lacking.
The long-term goal is to understand how persistent CVPR impairments impact long-term outcomes after
moderate to severe TBI, which is necessary for better prognostication and treatment protocols. At the present
time, no known treatments exist to prevent or attenuate the devastating effects of TBI, in part due to the poor
understanding of underlying pathophysiologic processes. The following specific aims will be studied to achieve
the overall objective: 1) Quantify the trajectories of impaired CVPR over the first year after moderate to severe
TBI; 2) Characterize the extent to which ANS dysfunction persists in the first year after moderate to severe TBI;
3) Determine the extent to which impaired CVPR is correlated with ANS dysfunction after moderate to severe
TBI; and 4) Explore the extent to which impaired CVPR and ANS dysfunction is associated with functional
outcomes 12 months following moderate to severe TBI. A longitudinal assessment of CVPR and ANS function
over the first 12 months following injury will be conducted in a cohort of 95 individuals with moderate to severe
TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] 3-12, loss of consciousness [LOC] greater than 30 minutes, or post-
traumatic amnesia [PTA] greater than 1 hour). An additionally cohort of 95 age- and sex-matched healthy
controls without prior history of TBI or cardiac disease will be enrolled for comparison. The non-invasive
pressure reactivity index (nPRx) will be used as a measure of CVPR, MSNA will be used to objectively
measure SNS activity, and HRV will be used to evaluate PNS activity at baseline (prior to inpatient
rehabilitation discharge) and quarterly intervals for 12 months following rehabilitation discharge. Individuals
with moderate to severe TBI will be assessed for overall functional outcomes using the Glasgow Outcome
Scale-Extended (GOS-E) and cognitive status using the Brief Test of Adult Cognition by Telephone (BTACT) at
12-month follow-up. The proposed project is innovative because it will be the first to assess objective
measures of CVPR and ANS dysfunction longitudinally for 12 months following moderate to severe TBI."
10931432,"The aim of Educational Pathways for Cancer Research (EPCR) at the Indiana University Simon Comprehensive
Cancer Center (IUSCCC) and the Indiana University Bloomington (IUB) School of Education is to provide cancer
research career pathways for students from underrepresented populations in a manner that ultimately increases
the quantity of and diversity within the biomedical workforce. This aim will be achieved by focusing on three
goals: 1) Prepare middle-level teachers to provide their students with the prerequisite knowledge and
dispositions toward medical research; 2) Provide high school teachers with integrated laboratory research
experience and curriculum development opportunities to enhance their biology and cancer-related teaching skills
and to create excitement for their students for science-related careers; and 3) Provide mentored, high-quality,
cancer-focused research experiences along with didactic and professional development workshops to high
school and early undergraduate students from underrepresented backgrounds to prepare them for medicine-, or
cancer-related fields. To address goal 1, 45 urban and rural middle-level teachers will take part in professional
development focused on project-based research activities, specifically highlighting cancer research. To address
goal 2, using our established relationships with local high school teachers, we will provide 15 high school
teachers educating students from underrepresented backgrounds with four weeks of laboratory research
experience and participation in curriculum development activities that integrate cancer-related topics into the
state curriculum. Relationships with teachers and their schools will continue throughout the year through field
trips and school trips. To address goal 3, 30 high school/undergraduate trainees will be recruited every year to
spend three months for each of two years performing cancer research. Project trainees will gain enhanced
laboratory and research skills, including appreciation of the cancer research enterprise and patient care,
understanding of career opportunities, and a long-term academic relationship with mentors. Program evaluation
will periodically assess EPCR for meeting benchmarks and achieving milestones. Benchmarks include the
development of cancer-related curriculum at middle and high school levels, advancement in the careers of middle
and high school teachers that can be attributed to participation in EPCR, and our high school and undergraduate
trainees pursuing careers in health sciences, particularly cancer research. Approximately 60 faculty members
with research programs and mentoring training and experience will serve as mentors, and additional faculty will
be recruited as needed. EPCR continues the success of our previous CURE program and expands the scope to
fulfill the mission of the IUSCCC to educate students and teachers from diverse backgrounds underrepresented
in biomedical research who will become ambassadors for cancer research and knowledge."
10897271,"ABSTRACT
Interferons (IFN) straddle the balance between protective responses that maintain cellular integrity and the
induction of deleterious inflammatory responses that cause irreversible tissue damage. The detection of viral
infection or the accumulation of cellular stress triggers the synthesis of both type I (IFN/) and type III IFNs
(IFNλ), which activate an overlapping JAK/STAT pathway to induce the expression of effector genes known as
interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). While almost all nucleated cells can respond to IFN/ stimulation, the
expression of the IFN receptor (IFNLR1) is restricted to a few cell types, primarily the epithelium. Studies on
the evolutionary requirement for overlapping IFN functions, revealed context-specific functions for IFNs: IFN/
drive antiviral and proinflammatory responses that can promote tissue damage when unabated, and IFNλ
confers antiviral protection with minimal inflammatory induction and reinforces the integrity of the barrier. My
previous work has defined how divergent activation of canonical transcription factors (TF), interferon regulatory
factors (IRF) and Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), specifies maladaptive IFN/
functions. IFNλ responses also become maladaptive and hinder barrier repair, yet understanding of how
parallel signaling events and cell identity disrupt the balance of the IFNλ pathophysiological functions is
lacking. My future work will utilize a multidisciplinary approach to fill this knowledge gap. We will 1) determine
how non-canonical signal integration, such as NF-kB and MAPK, defines the IFNλ-dependent barrier functions,
2) define how cell identity controls cytokine sensitivity, and 3) leverage genetics to identify novel cell-type
specific, non-canonical TF and chromatin modifiers that feed into the IFNλ response. These studies will
enhance our basic understanding of the shared and unique functions of IFN, identify cellular susceptibilities to
inflammatory damage, and guide the development of therapeutic interventions that dampen excessive
inflammatory responses while preserving the primordial antiviral functions of IFNs."

Polyamines are small organic compounds with two or more amine groups. These evolutionarily ancient
metabolites are essential for a variety of cellular processes, including cell growth and survival, and are present
at milli-molar concentrations in mammalian cells. Cellular polyamine concentrations are tightly regulated, and
changes in polyamine levels disrupt numerous cellular processes, including DNA compaction, transcription,
translation, autophagy, and stress response. Disruption of polyamine metabolism is also observed in several
diseases. Genetic mutations in polyamine metabolic pathways are linked with learning disability in Snyder-
Robinson syndrome and are a known risk factor for Parkinson's disease. Polyamine levels are elevated in many
cancers, and there is enormous interest in using this pathway as a chemotherapeutic target. Mechanistically,
how disruption of polyamine metabolism affects cell function and produces disease is not known. The precise
biochemical functions of polyamines in the cell remain mysterious. This gap in our knowledge stems from intrinsic
technological difficulties in probing polyamines.
This project will deliver new methods and conceptual frameworks to elucidate the molecular functions of
polyamines. One, we will develop new quantitative assays to measure polyamine concentrations in living cells.
Two, we will investigate how mammalian cells maintain polyamine homeostasis and identify the proteins involved
in their uptake. Third, we will examine how changes in cellular polyamine levels affect RNA localization, structure,
and translation. By delivering new technologies and functional frameworks, this work will advance our
understanding of the roles of polyamines in the cell, and may help unlock the pharmacological potential of these
metabolites in health and curing disease."

This R01 proposal aims to test the effectiveness, mechanism, and implementation of a navigation-based
multilevel intervention to improve the delivery of timely, equitable, guideline-adherent adjuvant therapy among
patients with head and neck cancer (HNC). HNC is a disease with poor survival and profound racial disparities
in mortality. For locally advanced HNC, guidelines recommend initiating postoperative radiation therapy (PORT)
within 6-weeks of surgery to optimize survival. However, delays starting guideline-adherent PORT (i.e., > 6
weeks after surgery) affect ~50% of patients with HNC and nearly 70% of Black patients with HNC and are thus
a key driver of poor survival and racial disparities in mortality. To date, interventions that improve the delivery of
timely, equitable guideline-adherent PORT among patients with HNC are lacking. To address this gap, we
developed ENDURE (Enhanced Navigation for Disparities and Untimely Radiation thErapy) as a navigation-
based multilevel intervention that modifies the structure, care delivery pathways, and behaviors of the cancer
care multiteam system to address patient-, team-, and organization-level barriers and thus improve the delivery
of timely, equitable PORT following surgery for HNC. Data from our single-arm and pilot randomized trial provide
evidence of NDURE’s feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness at improving timely guideline-
adherent PORT and decreasing racial disparities in delays. To build on these promising data and characterize
ENDURE’s implementation across diverse settings, we propose a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation
study. We will conduct a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial with n = 4 cancer centers (N = 484 patients)
randomized to sequentially deliver treatment as usual (TAU) then ENDURE to patients with HNC undergoing
surgery and PORT. Concurrently, we will conduct a mixed-methods study with quantitative assessments
supplemented by semi-structured interviews of patients, providers, and administrators to characterize the
implementation of ENDURE. Specific Aim 1 will evaluate the effectiveness of ENDURE at decreasing delays
starting guideline-adherent PORT relative to TAU. Specific Aim 2 will identify the mechanisms through which
ENDURE reduces treatment delays. Specific Aim 3 will characterize the implementation of ENDURE across
diverse clinical settings. Findings from our proposal have potential to address three important gaps. First, results
may support ENDURE as the first evidence-based strategy to decrease delays starting adjuvant therapy for
patients with HNC. Such a result may help change the current standard of care, improve survival, and decrease
racial disparities in mortality for these patients. Second, findings address an understudied but critical aspect of
cancer care delivery and could be translated to other types of cancer (e.g., breast, colon, lung) for which delays
initiating adjuvant therapy are common. Third, mechanism data may provide actionable knowledge to improve
the delivery of effective interprofessional team-based cancer care."
10877199,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The development of an organism requires a delicate balance of cell proliferation with cell cycle exit events that
necessitates the regulation of the cell cycle machinery to interface with the developmental program. Among
critical cell cycle exit events during development are cell differentiation and cell cycle pause, also known as
quiescence. The decision to proliferate or exit the cell cycle is influenced by a multitude of factors, including
developmental, environmental and nutritional cues. Failures in these decisions are the cause of cancer, as well
as developmental abnormalities and aging-related disorders. My overarching goal is to address how the core
cell cycle machinery integrates diverse inputs to execute the decision to enter and exit the quiescent state and
to couple the cell cycle to cell fate determination during development. My prior work employing C. elegans
provided fundamental new insights into the control of cell cycle state transitions in an in vivo context. Using the
developing germline, a tissue of utmost importance for the accurate propagation of the genomic information
across generations and where cell cycle regulation is tied to nutrient signaling, I uncovered a conserved
molecular mechanism that allows for the accumulation of cyclin B to drive entry into mitosis. I also determined
how the cell cycle machinery is specialized in different developmental contexts to promote cell proliferation, with
particular emphasis on the Cdk1-Cyclin B complex that coordinates mitotic entry and exit events. In this proposal,
my group will capitalize on our expertise in cell cycle regulation mechanisms, in vitro biochemistry and
developmental analyses to delineate the molecular mechanism by which germline precursors enter into and exit
from a non-cannonical form of quiescence at the G2 stage of the cell cycle in response to nutrient signaling, to
address how these signals interface with the pathways that regulate entry into mitosis, and to determine how the
cell cycle machinery intersects with cell fate specification to promote cell differentiation during embryonic
development. This work will drive new understanding of how cell cycle decision points are regulated during
development, which could help prevent and/or treat disorders originating from cell proliferation defects."

 Magnesium has been largely overlooked in neurobiology as a “housekeeping” ion, but this view is directly
challenged by evidence which shows that mutations in Mg2+ transporting proteins are associated with
neurodegeneration. Mutations in the Mg2+ transporting protein SLC41A1 are associated with both increased and
decreased risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). SLC41A1 might therefore be a causative gene for PD. Despite this,
little is known about SLC41A1. For example, we do not yet know if it causes rapid changes in free cytosolic Mg2+
(like an ion channel) or if it works to maintain the levels of free cytosolic Mg2+ within the range required for normal
cellular function (like a transporter). This distinction is required both to define the role of SLC41A1 in the Mg2+
homeostasis and its role in PD pathogenesis. Furthermore, a cellular role for SLC41A1 has not been determined
and it is therefore not known how its dysfunction might lead to PD.
 We hypothesize that SLC41A1 is a Mg2+-permeable ion channel which, through its role in maintaining
the cellular Mg2+ homeostasis, helps maintain the mitochondrial membrane potential and ensures that ATP
production via oxidative phosphorylation proceeds undisturbed. In this application for a Stephen I. Katz ESI
grant, we propose to use liposomal flux assays and lipid bilayer studies as well as electron cryo-microscopy
(cryo-EM) to determine how SLC41A1 mediates Mg2+ transport, and to generate a model to determine its cellular
role.
 Neuronal Mg2+ transport has thus far been virtually untouched by biophysical and structural investigation
and the study proposed here represents the first steps towards understanding the molecular mechanisms of
neuronal Mg2+ homeostasis as well as the Mg2+-dependent molecular origins of neurodegenerative disorders. In
the long term, this study of SLC41A1 has the potential to lead to novel treatments of and preventative strategies
against PD, a debilitating disease which costs the US health system more than $14 billion each year."

Burn injuries continue to be one of the leading causes of unintentional death and injury in the United States.
Non-fatal burn injuries are a leading cause of morbidity with the most common complications being infectious
related. Thermal injures result in massive fluctuations in the inflammatory and immune responses (e.g., plasma
cytokines, cellular phenotypes, immune function, and soluble proteins) and these changes have been associated
with mortality and infectious complications. However, the underlying mechanisms driving these dysfunctional
responses is still largely unknown both systemically and locally. Our primary goal is to investigate the systemic
and localized mechanisms of immune dysfunction following pediatric thermal injury to provide useful biomarkers
to identify those at highest risk to develop subsequent infection with a goal to develop therapies to improve
patient outcomes. Over the next five years we will pursue three integrated research plans that use both pediatric
blood and tissue samples as well as an established juvenile murine model of burn injury and infection, to
investigate the mechanisms of immune dysfunction after burn injury. Research Plan 1 will investigate the
mechanisms underlying lymphocyte dysfunction after severe burn injury. In this work we will assess the cell
surface expression of lymphocyte co-inhibitory molecules, examine apoptotic markers on isolated lymphocytes,
and perform functional assays. This work will provide insight into the mechanisms surrounding lymphocyte
dysfunction and guide future immunomodulatory therapies that can target these specific mechanisms. Research
Plan 2 will evaluate the differentiation of systemic monocytes to tissue macrophages after severe burn injury and
post-burn complications. In this work we will perform functional assays on isolated systemic monocyte
populations and isolated tissue macrophages. This work will lead us to a more complete mechanistic
understanding of the differentiation of systemic monocyte populations to the localized macrophages in the wound
bed. This information will inform the best route of administration (systemic or topical) to apply immunomodulatory
therapy to augment these macrophages and improve tissue level outcomes. Research Plan 3 will elucidate the
potential benefits of FDA-approved immunomodulator therapies after severe burn injury to prevent post-burn
complications. This work will use combination therapies, ex vivo in pediatric samples and in vivo in our murine
burn model, to assess changes in immune function. The findings from this study will be important to advance the
design of future immunostimulatory clinical trials in this population as well as other forms of surgical
predisposition to sepsis such as trauma and major surgery. Moreover, this could serve as a model for other age
groups of burn injuries. Together, these projects will provide an important building block for developing
appropriate therapeutics in treating burn wounds that can simultaneously help control inflammation, prevent
infection, and assist in wound healing, which is an absolute necessity for burn care research."
10907670,"Co-occurring neuropathologies such as Lewy bodies, hippocampal sclerosis, and microinfarcts likely influence
heterogeneity in genetic studies of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The genetic architecture of these co-occurring
neuropathologies is not clear. Most AD genetic analyses use clinical AD dementia phenotypes and are limited
by phenotype misclassification: many clinical AD “controls” harbor AD pathology while clinical AD “cases” have
no or minimal AD pathology. Only 20% of pathology confirmed AD dementia cases have only AD pathology
(“pure AD”); 80% have co-occurring neuropathologies (“mixed AD”). A complementary strategy is to perform
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) specifically distinguishing between pure and mixed AD. The
overarching goal of this proposal is to further scientific understanding of pure AD and mixed AD by integrating
neuropathology together with advanced statistical approaches and extensive multi-omics data.
Aim 1: Distinguish the genetic architecture of pure AD vs. mixed AD vs. pathology-free controls and
determine how associations are driven by particular neuropathological patterns.
 1a. Perform GWAS of pathology-confirmed AD controls vs. pure AD vs. mixed AD using a
 multinomial regression framework. We will also examine how associations are driven by particular
 neuropathological features furthering our understanding of underlying mechanisms.
 1b. Infer possible mechanisms by integrating biological knowledge. We will perform transcriptome-
 wide analyses and gene-network analyses of pure AD and mixed AD, integrating human PPI data.
Aim 2: Identify factors specific to pure AD or mixed AD.
 2a. Use machine learning and harmonized clinical data to isolate factors associated with pure or
 mixed AD. Identified clinical risk factors could be used for future clinical trial stratification.
 2b. Perform genetic correlation analysis and Mendelian randomization to estimate correlated genetic
 effects and potential causal effects between candidate risk factor traits and pure or mixed AD.
 Genetic correlation analysis will gain novel insights into the shared genetic basis between biobank-scale
 GWAS traits and pure AD and mixed AD. We will follow-up significant correlations with local genetic
 correlation and Mendelian randomization (MR) to identify specific genomic regions contributing to the
 correlation and quantify causal effects of these traits on pure AD and mixed AD.
Aim 3. Characterize the cellular and molecular consequences of pure AD vs mixed AD. We will harness
the data generated by the SEA-AD and the ROS-MAP studies to characterize the molecular changes occurring
for our phenotypes at cell type resolution. We will perform abundance analyses (3a), differential gene
expression (3b), and differential chromatin accessibility (3c) in each cell type across multiple brain regions. We
will investigate loci from recent GWASs of AD dementia and candidates from Aim 1."

 The goal of the Medical Students Summer in Oncology at Anderson Research (Med Students SOAR)
program is to provide 25 talented first-year medical students per year with an individualized, hands-on research
experience in oncology under the mentorship of our expert faculty, while exposing participants to multidisciplinary
cancer care through clinical observations and interprofessional simulation trainings. An increase in knowledge
of all areas of oncology will be included in the curricula, as well as career development and networking
opportunities. The program objective is to promote careers in cancer research, which is in line with the NCI’s
mission to enhance the training of a workforce to meet the nation’s biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research
needs. This objective will be accomplished through a formalized 8- to 10-week program at The University of
Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. MD Anderson, an NCI-designated cancer center that is widely
recognized for its outstanding clinical care and number one ranking in awarded NCI grants, is ideally positioned
to provide this research experience. Our highly regarded clinical care combined with an emphasis on research
makes it an environment unparalleled for mentored research and educational programs. The Program Directors
(Marites Melancon, PhD; Vickie Shannon, MD; and Jillian Gunther, MD, PhD) are faculty members with
successful research programs and experience in leading education programs. Participating faculty members are
not only committed educators but also internationally recognized experts in various fields, spanning basic,
translational, and clinical research. Students will be matched with faculty mentors, and they will discuss and
decide on the research project prior to the summer. During the summer session, students will complete their
projects with structured mentoring and evaluation. Instruction in the Responsible Conduct of Research will be
included. Students will also learn about other areas of cancer biology and career development through program
lecture series, clinical observation, interprofessional clinical simulation, near-peer mentoring, communication
skills workshops, and seminars. The program will culminate in a Summer Experience Final Exposition, in which
students present their research project to faculty, students, and staff. Our recruitment plan seeks to attract highly
qualified applicants from all racial, ethnic, and gender groups but with increased representation from
underrepresented groups based on race, ethnicity, disability, or other social, cultural, or economic
disadvantages. Successful implementation of this program will directly address the need to cultivate interest in
oncology, and specifically cancer research, early in medical careers in order to recruit and retain future cancer
researchers."

Specific recognition of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) structures underlies key biological
processes from development to antiviral immune responses, and involves a host of dsRNA-
binding proteins. Biochemical and structural studies have delineated how these proteins interact
with model ligands, yet dsRNAs that they encounter in cells are far more complex. Moreover, little
is known about how cells regulate dsRNA recognition. The goal of my lab is to understand how
dsRNA-binding proteins interact with natural dsRNAs in cells, connecting biochemical models of
dsRNA recognition to cellular dsRNA recognition and regulation. In the next five years, we will
focus on dsRNA recognition in microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis and innate immune sensing.
During miRNA biogenesis, Microprocessor recognizes and cleaves hairpin-like structures from
long transcripts called primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs). My previous research built a unifying model
of human pri-miRNA and discovered that an optimal miRNA hairpin enhances the cleavage of a
suboptimal miRNA hairpin on the same transcript—known as cluster assistance. Because nearly
40% of human miRNAs reside in clusters, with many implicated in diseases and influenced by
cluster assistance, we propose to dissect this fundamental regulatory mechanism in miRNA
biogenesis using biochemical, single-molecule, and structural approaches. Recognition of dsRNA
by innate immune sensors such as RIG-I and MDA5 initiates antiviral responses. Recent studies
show that endogenous dsRNAs can also activate these sensors, sometimes resulting in
autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The recognition of self dsRNAs therefore needs to
be restricted by proteins that modify, degrade or shield endogenous dsRNAs. Building on our
expertise in dsRNA recognition and processing, we will 1) develop new biochemical methods to
identify dsRNA ligands of innate immune sensors, and 2) develop new genetic screen methods
to identify factors that restrict self dsRNA sensing in innate immunity. Together these studies will
provide crucial insights into how cellular dsRNAs are sensed and regulated, with therapeutic
implications for cancer, autoimmune and infectious diseases."

Neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by distinct as well as shared clinical features that present in
heterogeneous symptom profiles. Delineating the neurobiological etiology of clinical symptoms has been
a key overarching aim of over 20 years of neuropsychiatric research. From the earliest studies,
neuroimaging research has identified abnormalities in regional brain structure and function. However, we
know that there is significant heterogeneity in brain structure and function in neuropsychiatric disorders.
Imaging analytic and machine learning methods developed by our group provide the analytic approaches
needed to quantify heterogeneity in neuropsychiatric disorders. Herein we leverage these methods, along
with a broad international collaboration which provides a unique resource of large highly phenotyped
datasets, in order to quantify heterogeneity in major depressive disorder (MDD). In the proposed project,
we focus on neuroanatomy and neurofunctional connectivity in MDD. We aim to identify imaging signatures
and subtypes in MDD by applying state-of-the-art harmonization, pattern analysis and machine learning
methods to structural and resting state functional MRI. The analytic methods allow us to quantify the
neuroanatomical and neurofunctional connectivity patterns that comprise MDD to provide powerful
predictive markers at the individual level. Our goal is to arrive at a new neuroanatomical-neurofunctional
(NA-NF) dimensional coordinate system in MDD (MDD COORDINATES), whereby each dimension reflects
a different pattern of brain alterations, hence capturing the underlying NA-NF heterogeneity in quantifiable,
replicable, and neurobiologically-based metrics. We will leverage data from our pooled cohorts consists of
4,973 adults with first episode and recurrent MDD, in a current depressive episode, that is not treatment
resistant, all medication-free, and respective healthy controls. Assembling these large and powerful
datasets will allow us to test our first hypothesis, namely that neuroanatomical and neurofunctional
phenotypes will display high heterogeneity, which will allow us to define NA-NF dimensions of pathology.
We then test the second hypothesis, namely that this heterogeneity will relate to disease-related
phenotypes in MDD and different patterns of clinical outcome. Our specific aims will 1) refine and apply
advanced harmonization methods in order to constructively pool and integrate this unique resource; 2)
dissect the heterogeneity of the neuroanatomy and function in MDD, thereby deriving a neuroimaging-
based coordinate system; 3) relate these imaging dimensions with clinical phenotypic measures, including
response to treatment."

The success of life on earth derives from its use of molecules to carry information and
implement algorithms that control chemistry, allowing organisms to respond adaptively to their
environment. The ability to transduce information and respond adaptively ultimately relies on
molecular systems being able to selectively recognize one molecular signal from among many
other similar signals. The signal could be a molecule (molecular specificity), a combination of
molecules (combinatorial specificity), or a time varying concentration pattern (temporal
specificity). Further, these molecular systems need to remain adaptable to switch their
specificity as needed. The central goal of this proposal is to understand the molecular
basis of information processing by building predictive models of molecular,
combinatorial and temporal specificity and adaptability of such specificity. We will
combine biophysically grounded models, information theory and dynamical systems frameworks
for signaling to create data-driven models of molecular, combinatorial and temporal specificity.
We will pursue questions on three scales: (1) molecular specificity: how do proteins like
antibodies recognize a specific partner, such as an epitope on a viral spike protein, and yet can
rapidly change its specificity through mutations? We will develop a biophysically informed
machine learning-based toolbox to exploit evolutionary trajectories observed in directed
evolution experiments to understand the origin of such adaptability. (2) combinatorial
specificity: how do developmental pathways like BMP and TGF-beta resolve specific ligand
combinations to determine cell fate, even though each ligand promiscuously binds multiple
receptors? We will use an information theory framework for molecular cooperativity to build
models of many-many signaling architectures and validate using cell atlas data and experiments
that co-express novel combinations of receptor subunits. (3) temporal specificity: how do
molecular circuits respond to specific time-varying patterns of concentrations but not others in
cytokine signaling and in circadian rhythms? We will develop dynamical systems-theory guided
models of stochastic resonance that allow NF-kB to respond to otherwise undetectable levels of
cytokines and models of circadian clock-metabolism coupling to understand how cells buffer
nutrient fluctuations. Our work is distinguished by combining biophysical models which provide
understanding and insight with statistical models that are better able to leverage modern high-
throughput data and provide predictive power. In addition, our inference toolboxes and
related theory-experiment workflows can used by other labs for similar conceptual
questions about alternate systems, such as, molecular specificity for antibodies and spike
proteins, combinatorial specificity in the TGF-beta pathway or temporal specificity in EGF
signaling respectively for the three thrusts above."
10922734,"SUMMARY
 A major challenge to our progress in understanding the functional organization of the nervous system is
the practical schism between cellular/molecular and systems sub-fields within the broader neuroscience
community. For example, synaptic transmission is the fundamental mechanism by which activity propagates
between neurons. While we have a detailed understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying
this process, the dynamic range and operating regime of synapses in the intact, behaving animal is essentially
unknown. Based on recent data from our laboratory, our overall goal in this proposal is to investigate the
hypothesis that variations in behavior over multiple time scales are associated with fluctuations in the strength
of synaptic transmission within neuronal networks of the mammalian neocortex. With a groundbreaking
combination of conceptual and methodological innovations, we will specifically identify the modifications of
synaptic function that correspond to changes in behavioral state and perceptual learning. Specifically, we
propose to monitor variation in synaptic release probability, potency, and integration for targeted circuits within
the mouse visual cortex, relating these properties to behavioral state transitions and enhanced perceptual ability
associated with visuomotor learning. Overall, this ambitious paradigm will generate critical new insights into the
relationships between synapses, circuits, and behavior and open up new avenues of exploration that unite
diverse areas of the neuroscience community."

1 in 5 liver waitlist patients do not receive a new liver in time, while many more patients are never listed but could
benefit from liver replacement. While “bridge-to-transplant” technologies (ventricular assist devices and dialysis)
have transformed the outlook for heart failure and kidney failure, no such treatment exists for patients with liver
failure. Current liver sharing limits (approx. 500 miles) are based on limited preservation durations (6-10 hours).
By extending preservation to just a few days we can enable nationwide (theoretically global) donor-recipient
matching, allowing many livers that go untransplanted today (e.g. subsets of extended criteria donor livers that
have been shown to offer substantial survival benefits) to be offered to the patients who most need them.
Transplant surgeons have expressed excitement about this possibility, and it is thought that this achievement
would have a profound impact on liver waitlist mortality. Among other benefits, this can also increase graft
lifespan and reduce immunological rejection, eliminate the need for costly jet and helicopter transport, transform
the practice of liver transplantation from emergency surgery to a flexibly scheduled procedure, and mitigate the
severe disparities in liver transplantation. It will also allow immune tolerance induction protocols that have now
achieved success in living donation to be adapted to the deceased donor context. To meet these needs, we
will develop a comprehensive system for banking human livers for transplantation for periods of 5-7
days with a stretch goal of 10+ days or longer. We have created an integrated two-pronged approach to
develop new stasis cocktails optimized for the critical phases of liver preservation: preconditioning and protection
(prior to storage), preservation (during storage) and revival- resuscitation-repair (after storage). In parallel, we
are creating devices for advanced perfusion, storage, and organ assessment before transplant decision. Our
approach adapts the best strategies of freeze-tolerant and hibernating species, augmenting them with recent
scientific and bioengineering advances. Importantly, we do not seek to solve all the problems of classical
cryopreservation, but rather to be the first to develop preservation in thermodynamic equilibrium at high subzero
(HSZ) temperatures (-10°C to -30°C), combined with programmed metabolic depression and enhanced stress
tolerance. Feasibility of this approach has already been demonstrated; we have banked rat livers for 5 days
at HSZ temperatures, and successfully preserved the first whole human liver lobe at -15°C. For this fast-track
proposal, the Phase 1 goal will be to further refine our protocols and validate our initial unprecedented storage
duration by banking rat livers for 5-7 days and using comprehensive post-preservation normothermic machine
perfusion with functional assessment. We will also scale to whole human liver lobes, with subsequent hepatocyte
isolation. Phase 2 will focus on optimizing key parameters that affect preservation outcomes in rat and human livers.
Our goal is 6-10+ days of storage via (i) optimal modulation of ice growth, (ii) nature-inspired de-toxify/reenergize
perfusion phase and (iii) precise control of thermodynamics using a prototype Bio-Thermodulator device."
10909860,"Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) are endemic in both acute care and nursing homes (NHs). However,
predictors for new MDRO acquisition in older adults and transmission to healthcare professionals (HCPs) and
the environment, particularly outside of patient rooms, remain unclear. This is relevant in today’s
contemporary healthcare systems with patient movement outside the rooms for medical diagnostics and
treatment- such as rehabilitation including physical and occupational therapy, procedures such as biopsies,
services such as dialysis, infusion clinics and recreational activities- presenting a tremendous potential for
transmission of organisms
With this project and a focus on high-risk NH Veterans, our aims are to first characterize the changing
epidemiology of MDROs at 3 VA NHs with the explicit goal of developing a ‘Patient Movement Index’ depicting
the role of out-of-room visits for medical appointments and recreation in MDRO transmission across the
institution. Using molecular and genomic methods, we will develop an understanding of the impact of MDRO
transmission, predominant strains circulating in the NHs and other patient use areas. Using an ‘Intervention
Mapping Framework’ we will next develop and pilot an integrated multi-modal intervention involving
Veterans, their families, HCP as well as leadership to reduce transmission and infections. We anticipate this
intervention to include: 1) Veterans’ and caregivers’ hand hygiene and infection prevention education; 2)
provider education on MDRO prevention strategies and environmental cleaning; and 3) leadership
involvement including infection prevention team, VA NH leadership, and managers of common use areas
frequented by our participants. Patterns of patient movements outside their rooms as well as the molecular and
genomic data obtained in Specific Aim 1 will be critical in informing our intervention.
Our proposed translational study is innovative and timely as we plan to develop a new index that will
characterize the amount of time Veterans spend outside their immediate environment in a colonized state and
define a “fingerprint” of Veteran-caregiver-environment contamination. These studies will open a new line of
inquiry allowing us to design future projects in order to characterize patient movement and transmission in
other service areas such as hospitals and specialized units. We expect our results to have widespread
application within and outside the VA, enhance Veterans’ quality of life by improving their hygiene practices
and preventing infections, and help understand MDRO transmission within an evolving healthcare system.
Our multidisciplinary team with expertise in aging, epidemiology including molecular epidemiology,
microbiology, infectious diseases, health outcomes, nursing and patient oriented research is uniquely
positioned to achieve our goals and advance the field."

 Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of death in humans, yet the molecular mechanisms
underlying these devastating conditions have not been fully elucidated. Cardiac disease is especially common
in the elderly, and as the global population ages their elevated incidence will pose a serious healthcare challenge.
An important structure in heart muscle cells is the intercalated disc (ICD), which mediates the coordination of the
cardiac syncytium. It functions by connecting neighboring cardiomyocytes, thereby maintaining the functional
integrity of this syncytium; this is crucial to the proper contraction of the heart. Although many reports
demonstrate the importance of ICDs in the organization of the myocardium, relatively little is known about how
these cell-to-cell junctions transmit information between cardiac muscle cells to modulate gene expression and
cardiac function.
 The Xin-repeat containing adaptor proteins Xinα and Xinβ, also called XIRP1 and XIRP2 respectively, were
first discovered by the PI. These two proteins are located in the ICD of adult cardiomyocytes and interact with
various adherens junction proteins including N-cadherin and β-catenin, supporting an essential role for them in
the formation/maintenance of this structure. They also play important roles during early cardiac development
and in the pathogenesis of heart disease. However, the role of the Xin proteins remains poorly studied and their
specific cellular and molecular functions are largely unknown. Our recent studies of the hearts of Xin knock-out
(KO) mice have identified defects in development associated with impaired cardiomyocyte proliferation. Our
studies further demonstrated a physical and genetic interaction between Xin and NF2, a component of the
important Hippo/YAP pathway. The Hippo-YAP pathway is a highly conserved cellular regulatory network that
has been previously implicated in multiple developmental systems and disease, including the heart; however,
the mechanisms of its action remain unclear and a link to the ICD is a novel and exciting new discovery.
 Therefore, we have designed two integrative Specific Aims to test the mechanism by which the ICD
protein Xin mediates cardiomyocyte proliferation, maturation, and regeneration. For the first Aim, we
will investigate the interaction between Xin and the Hippo/YAP pathway. We will study how Xin regulates YAP
activity and how the interaction between Xin and Hippo-YAP signaling regulates cardiac function and
regeneration. For the second Aim, we will study how YAP/Tead1 regulates Xin transcription and test our
hypothesis that Xin-YAP cross-regulation is crucial to cardiac gene expression and heart regeneration.
 The studies proposed here will reveal novel molecular mechanisms by which the important
pathophysiological Hippo/YAP signal is modulated by the ICD protein Xin in the heart. The molecules defined
in this study will become targets for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of cardiac diseases."
10837881,"This proposed study concerns the proteolytic machinery that regulates tissue aging, inflammation, and
metabolic deregulation. The proteasome population is largely shifted from the standard proteasome to the
immunoproteasome under inflammation. The immunoproteasome is different from the standard proteasome
in the 20S core three catalytic subunits. It has distinct processing kinetics and cleavage preferences, and
associates with the 11S regulatory complex to perform ATP- and ubiquitination-independent degradation of
proteins. Its expression is highly increased in high fat diet mouse liver and in liver biopsies from patients who
have chronic active hepatitis or cirrhosis. The immunoproteasome level is highly increased in pathological
hepatocytes from human in direct correlation with the histopathological grade of inflammation. The
immunoproteasome is highly induced in aged mouse and rat tissues. Its prolonged presence can cause
chronic inflammation and tissue damages and can have devastating effects on the stability of proteins, many
of which are anti-inflammatory factors or homeostatic factors otherwise stable. Our study is based on the
overarching concept that the immunoproteasome plays the major role in inflammation-specific degradation of
proteins. The degradation may cause metabolic reprogramming and the transition between glycolysis and
oxidative phosphorylation, shifting the cellular metabolism that fits in the inflammatory conditions. The long-
term goal of our study is to understand the functions of the immunoproteasome in inflammatory metabolic
diseases. Its strong relevance with inflammation, its immunological aspect of regulation, its dynamic nature,
and its high expression in immune cells and aged tissues and high fat diet mouse tissues all point toward the
possibility that the immunoproteasome might play crucial roles in inflammatory metabolic diseases. The
objective of this proposed study is to define the mechanisms by which the immunoproteasome regulates
energy metabolism via the selective digestion of key metabolic regulators. Despite its discovery nearly three
decades ago, its specific function remains largely unknown other than its role in producing antigenic peptides.
We have identified several regulators of the mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolism under the control by
the immunoproteasome. We hypothesize that the immunoproteasome induces metabolic reprogramming by
digestion of proteins involved in metabolic homeostasis. Although we do not exclude the possibility that the
reprogramming might be protective in early stages of stress response, we hypothesize that its excessive,
prolonged presence disturbs metabolic homeostasis. This grant will focus on the 11S-associated
immunoproteasome, the major type of the proteasome during inflammation. We will pursue three specific
aims. First, we will determine how the immunoproteasome perturbs mitochondrial metabolism using mouse
and cellular models. Second, we will define the role of PA28alpha-associated immunoproteasome in hepatic
metabolism. Third, we will identify the molecular factors that mediate 11S-immunoproteasome functions."

Glioblastoma (GBM) is an incurable primary malignant brain cancer characterized by a high degree of
interpatient and intratumoral genomic and cellular heterogeneity, a brief median survival (~15 months), and
absence of an effective treatment. Even the successes of checkpoint blockade immunotherapies observed in
many cancers have not translated to GBM. The GBM tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) is highly
immunosuppressive and is dominated by resident and infiltrating myeloid cells (30-40% of the tumor mass)
compared to rare T cells (<5%). Although recent single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) studies have
provided broad characterization of the cellular makeup and evolution of GBM tumor cells, dissecting the
diversity, function and regional localization of the immune composition of GBM remains incomplete. There is
also a widespread lack of knowledge on the evolution of intratumoral immune cells during GBM progression,
and throughout treatment with standard of care (SOC) therapies (ionizing radiation/
temozolomide/dexamethasone IR/TMZ/DEX). Major challenges to achieving scientific and clinical impact in
GBM remain, including an in-depth understanding of the interactions between cancer cells and the immune
microenvironment in the context of SOC and immunotherapy treatments. Such knowledge is difficult to obtain
using freshly excised patient samples. The main hypothesis of the proposal is that critical and clinically relevant
changes in GBM neoplastic and immune cells brought about by treatment modalities can be revealed using
genetically accurate mouse models to parse and redirect analyses of human patient datasets. A mechanistic
understanding of the effects of therapies on immune and tumorigenic cell population dynamics in pre-clinical
mouse models in combination with analysis of human patient datasets will yield transformative advancements
in the field. We will leverage archival patient samples, mouse models of GBM and GLASS consortium datasets
to uncover SOC-related cellular and molecular evolutionary changes using scRNA seq and spatial
transcriptomics. We will also unveil factors determining sensitivity and resistance to checkpoint blockade
therapy. By integrating detailed mouse and human data, we will identify areas of unrecognized therapeutic
vulnerabilities and pave the way for the development of new treatment approaches."

Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a chronic relapsing illness associated with high rates of relapse, and thus, there
is great need to develop and evaluate novel treatments to decrease relapse and improve alcohol use
outcomes in AUD. We previously conducted a novel dose finding human laboratory, safety and pilot efficacy
study to assess whether the neuroactive steroid (NAS) precursor pregnenolone (PREG) that influences
GABAergic functioning may normalize alcohol-related stress disruption and improve alcohol use outcomes in
AUD. Pilot data showed that PREG at 300mg/day reduced stress- and cue- induced alcohol craving, anxiety
and normalized chronic alcohol-related disruption in stress biology and also reduced alcohol drinks/day
(AvgD), percent drinking days and heavy drinking days (%DD and %HDD) compared to placebo (PBO) in an 8-
week clinical study. On the basis of these findings, this project proposes a 12-week double blind, randomized
Phase II clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PREG treatment (300 mg/day) versus PBO in 150
AUD men and women. The following specific aims will be addressed: Aim #1: To establish the safety and
tolerability of PREG (300mg/day) vs. PBO in men and women with AUD over the 12-week treatment period
and at the 1-month follow up. Aim #2: To test the efficacy of PREG vs. PBO on the primary alcohol use
outcome of PSNHDD and secondary drinking outcomes of HDD%, DD% and AvgD during the trial. Aim #3: To
assess the effects of PREG vs. PBO on other secondary stress-related outcomes of alcohol craving, anxiety,
depression and patient-related functioning during the trial. Aim #4: To assess the effects of PREG vs. PBO on
PREG and other NAS levels and examine their relationship to primary and secondary alcohol use and related
outcomes. Exploratory Aim 1: To assess enduring short-term treatment effect of PREG vs. PBO on primary
and other secondary outcomes at a 1-month post-treatment follow-up. Exploratory Aim 2: To explore whether
pre-treatment patient characteristics (sex, trauma history, AUD severity and co-occurring psychiatric disorders)
influence PREG effects on primary and secondary outcomes. It is well known that chronic alcohol use
downregulates GABA which plays a significant role in the stress pathophysiology of AUD and also in loss of
control drinking. The proposed study is based on our novel preliminary findings and will test our innovative
approach of boosting endogenous neuroactive steroid levels to increase their function and thereby improve
AUD outcomes. If successful, the proposed research will establish PREG and neuroactive steroids as key
targets in the treatment of AUD, and also provide data on neuroactive steroid levels and whether they may
serve as biomarkers in AUD treatment."
10876375,"Project Summary / Abstract
Exposure to air pollution consistently ranks among the leading global causes of illness and death, a majority of
which can be attributed to airborne particulate matter (PM) pollution. The lack of effective interventions are due
in large part to our inability to properly characterize and quantify air pollutants with the spatial and temporal
resolution that represents personal exposures. Most existing tools for monitoring air pollution are incapable of
accurately measuring exposures to multiple pollutants or the variability of pollutant chemical composition within
and across individual microenvironments, time of day, personal lifestyles, etc. The long term goal of our team is
to establish an infrastructure for real-time, continuous, multi-pollutant, air quality monitoring with very high spatial
and temporal resolution, enabling groundbreaking environmental health research leading to effective,
personalized, exposure analytics and interventions to ultimately reduce exposures to air pollutants and improve
overall public health. In Phase 1 of this effort, we have developed wearable technologies for continuous gaseous
air pollutant monitoring under an ongoing grant. Herein, we propose Phase 2 development of wearable
technologies for continuous airborne particulate monitoring. The objective of this renewal application is to
develop a wearable system that can, in real time, quantify size-fractionated PM across two orders of
hydrodynamic diameter (~2.5µm to 50nm) and classify health-critical elemental components of PM, trace metals
and elemental carbon. This cost effective system could be distributed over a network of users, gathering real-
time data while mobile in the environment, over a wide spatial distribution, with high spatial and temporal
resolution. Moreover, by time tagging this data with environmental (temperature, humidity, etc.) and physical
(location, activity, etc.) parameters, our system would permit an unprecedentedly information rich dataset for
offline analysis and health impact modeling, as well as for personal exposure management at the individual user
level. The Specific Aims of this project are to: 1) Develop and characterize a miniaturized system for real-time
PM capture and size fractionation (accomplished by development of a miniaturized component to capture
airborne PM in a liquid, followed by a microfluidic component that separates the PM into five size bins); 2)
Develop and characterize a miniaturized system for real-time PM quantification and elemental component
classification (accomplished by capacitively counting particles within each size bin followed by electrochemical
classification of trace metal and elemental carbon components); and 3) Evaluate the new PM monitoring system
for community health studies in real world environments (accomplished by field testing and evaluation against
stationary federal reference methods for PM mass and chemical composition, followed by a community exposure
assessment study to characterize the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of air pollutants across disparate
communities of health burden and risk within the Detroit urban area)."

Our goal is to continue a career-development program at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) termed
IRACDA at UCLA, for transitioning diverse postdoctoral scholars into university-level academic positions. This
interdisciplinary program will train new Ph.D. level scholars in research through UCLA's high-quality, discipline-
specific programs, and in career development through stage-specific workshops. In parallel, scholars will be
trained in inclusive, active learning pedagogy, and assessment by UCLA's “Center for Education Innovation and
Learning in the Sciences” (CEILS), the national ""Center for Integration of Research, Teaching and Learning""
(CIRTL), and UCLA's Summer Institute (SI). An accompanying two-stage mentored teaching experience, termed
practicums 1 and 2, will occur at our partner institution, California State University, Los Angeles (Cal State LA),
which comprises >70% URMs in STEM majors. Our scholars will teach introductory and advanced biology, and
biochemistry courses with their mentors, while introducing novel pedagogical approaches based on CIRTL's
Teaching as Research (TAR) core mission. The scholars will also team-teach their own course, BIOL4540, which
will train Cal State LA undergraduates to read, present and critique the primary literature. UCLA's Center for
Educational Assessment (CEA) will formatively evaluate the program annually. CEA along with assessment
performed at Cal State LA, will improve the scholars' teaching skills, and course content, benefiting our partner
institution. A steady state of nine IRACDA-funded scholars are necessary to form an effective cohort and learning
community to impact Cal State LA's courses.
 UCLA's research training faculty includes fifty-two outstanding scientists chosen for their diversity, and
their records of leadership, scholarship, and mentoring. The training faculty cover a breadth of NIGMS-relevant
research topics and participate in outstanding science that will allow scholars to obtain advanced research
training using state of the art facilities. Recent Ph.Ds. with excellent research credentials and a commitment to
teaching will be actively recruited. Stipend support in the first year of research will be from the research mentors,
while the following three years will be from IRACDA. After a year of intense research, teaching will be interwoven
into the program. A key aspect of the mentored teaching experience will be development of a TAR project during
a limited practicum 1, where the scholars shadow their teaching mentor and teach four lectures. The TAR project
will be refined in UCLA's SI between the scholars' first and second years of IRACDA funding, and implemented
during Practicum 2, where the scholars will teach half of the mentors' classes. The last IRACDA-funded year will
focus on research, paper-writing, job preparation, and completing requirements for CIRTL Scholar-level

and Cal State LA to the development of a new generation of highly effective faculty trained in pedagogy that
enhances URM retention in the major, and transition to both graduate schools and the workforce."

The overarching objective of the proposed studies is to identify and characterize early premalignant changes in
breast tissues from women that carry genetic alterations associated with a high risk of breast cancer to ultimately
develop strategies to detect and prevent the development of breast cancer. To accomplish this goal, we have
optimized three technologies to profile single breast mammary cells (MECs): (1) CyTOF mass cytometry to allow
tracking in parallel of >30 cell lineage and proliferation markers, (2) single cell RNA sequencing to identify
expression programs of cell populations enriched in mutation-carriers, and (3) multi-plex cyclic immunofluorescence
imaging (CyCIF) to simultaneous image >50 markers in situ. These technologies make it possible to detect
differences in small populations of cells that would be masked by bulk population analyses. To date, we have
profiled breast tissues from over 30 women with wild-type or mutant BRCA1 or BRCA2 by CyTOF and have
identified distinct, previously unrecognized subpopulations of cells that are enriched in breast tissues from BRCA1
and/or BRCA2 carriers. These enriched subpopulations may represent cells that are either directly on the path to
malignancy or indirectly contribute to the development of cancer in these high-risk women. We have identified RNA
signatures associated with these enriched subpopulations, which include surface markers to isolate them from
breast tissue to investigate both these possibilities and to track them within breast tumors. The signatures
associated with one of the enriched populations have provided clues as to the basis for their accumulation, as well
as potential strategies to prevent their accumulation. Using CyCIF, we have been able to identify enriched
subpopulations of cells in situ within breast tissues and track their association with aberrant histologies. We have
also developed organoid cultures that maintain all of the major MEC lineages as well as the BRCA1/2-enriched
populations, and that are able to reconstitute glandular structures in immunocompromised mice. We believe that
these tools provide an unprecedented opportunity to track the development of human cancer. In the proposed
studies, we will investigate whether and how the BRCA1/2+/mut-enriched subpopulations contribute to
tumorigenesis in mutation carriers. We will also investigate the basis for the enrichment of these populations and
the contribution of DNA damage to their enrichment. Later stage studies will focus on the development of strategies
to interfere with tumor progression, and importantly to develop novel diagnostic strategies to inform on the timing of
prophylactic interventions. In addition, we will examine tissues from women who carry mutations in other breast
cancer predisposition genes to establish whether similar subpopulations are detected in other high-risk individuals.
And lastly, we will examine the possibility that these cells represent cells-of-origin of sporadic breast tumors that
arise more broadly in the population."
10896227,"Project 1 Summary
Post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) affects 15-40% of those with traumatic brain injury (TBI) causing
significant morbidity even after initial recovery from the TBI. Major limitations in understanding the
pathophysiology of PTE are a lack of biofidelic modeling of PTE in the gyrencephalic brain and
biomarkers that identify or predict PTE. Our long-term goal is to understand the pathophysiology the
leads to PTE in order to develop therapies that halt or inhibit the progression of pathogenesis that leads
to post-traumatic epilepsy. The overall objective is to identify biomarkers of PTE in a gyrencephalic
brain and the ionic basis of PTE. Our central hypotheses are that long-term ionic changes alters
GABAergic signaling leading to PTE and biomarkers of PTE can be identified with machine learning
boosting algorithms. The rationale is that a toolkit of automated methods of quantifying biomarkers in a
biofidelic model of PTE along with insight into the ionic changes that mediate GABAergic signaling will
allow identification of new therapeutic targets and allow efficient testing of those targets to prevent the
development of PTE in patients with TBI.
We will test our central hypotheses with two Specific Aims: Aim 1: We will train previously established
algorithms to identify the best mode, or combination of modes, to identify seizure candidates in these
models of PTE and maybe to even predict PTE. We hypothesize that we can use existing algorithms to
rapidly analyze behavior and ECoG, identify seizure correlates, and together with peripheral serum
biomarkers, use existing boosting algorithms to predict which subjects will develop PTE. Aim 2: We will
determine if chronic changes in the ionic basis of GABAergic signaling and in the neocortical network
activity are indicated by IED’s and biomarkers in the latent period. We hypothesize that those pigs that
develop PTE will have greater peripheral plasma biomarkers associated with inflammation and blood
brain barrier opening, greater changes in Cl-o and Cl-I, and faster development of hypersynchronous
local and global network activity (EEG).
The is approach is innovative in that, we bring cell imaging technology developed in rodent and
organotypic culture models and newly developed algorithms to the gyrencephalic brain merging the
fields of high technology and large animal models. Our contribution is significant as tools and
biomarkers will enable wider use of gyrencephalic models of PTE and prediction of PTE will open up
large fields of study not yet possible. Understanding the extracellular-matrix-induced changes that alter
the ionic bases of GABAergic signaling and local and global network changes in the same subjects
during the course of epileptogenesis may identify mechanisms of epileptogenesis that serve as targets
for therapies that may prevent the development of PTE."
10896230,"Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE), following a latent period of no
seizures, in approximately 20% of the civilian population. The factors that influence whether a person develops
epilepsy following TBI include severity of injury, patient demographic, and a wide swath of poorly characterized
cellular and molecular processes that take place during the latent period. Developing effective interventional
therapies to prevent PTE will depend critically on identifying the earliest molecular pathways that are specifically
epileptogenic. Acquiring such data in biophysically relevant models has been technically challenging.
Neuroinflammatory processes following TBI in rodents have been widely studied, but clinical translatability of
findings has been poor. Studies in humans and large gyrencephalic animals have been largely confined to large-
scale electrographic recordings and ex vivo physiological and histological analysis. Four findings stand out from
these studies as hallmarks of an epileptic brain: 1) gliosis at the site of injury, 2) GABA-mediated synaptic activity
that is excitatory rather than inhibitory, 3) a prevalence of non-ictal hypersynchronous electrical activity, and 4)
disruption of functional network connectivity at the macro (whole-brain) level. Several lines of published and
preliminary data suggest that gliotic tissue resulting from TBI produces an extracellular matrix that stably lowers
extracellular chloride. This, in turn, depolarizes the GABA reversal potential (EGABA).
We hypothesize that the resulting disinhibition will increase the synchronicity of neuronal activity, beginning at
the site of injury, where the gliotic scar forms. We have recently developed a porcine model of neocortical post-
traumatic epilepsy and the imaging tools (fluorophores, large-animal 2-photon microscope, and supporting
technologies) to longitudinally study the epileptic focus with single-neuron precision and multimodal (chloride
and calcium) fluorescence data. In this project, we will simultaneously image intra or extracellular chloride and
calcium activity before injury, during the latent period, and after the emergence of spontaneous seizures. We
will also chemically alter the extracellular matrix (which in turn alters extracellular chloride) to test for a causal
link between extracellular chloride and functional connectivity. We will use these data to evaluate the
hypothesis that depolarizing changes in EGABA produces epileptogenic changes in functional network connectivity
and that these changes correlate with clinically measurable epileptic phenotypes.
This rich dataset will inform development of anti-PTE treatments as follows. If a decrease in extracellular
chloride is associated with increased neuronal activity and network connectivity, then treatments that alter the
formation of gliotic extracellular matrix (e.g. matrix metalloproteinases) may prevent neuronal synchronization
during the latent period and prevent PTE itself. If an increase in intracellular chloride is associated with
increased neuronal activity and functional connectivity, then intracellular protease inhibitors or transport
inhibitors may be more effective. If neuronal activity and network connectivity are uncorrelated with chloride
changes, but predictive of PTE, then it may be necessary to focus on developing treatments that directly
manipulate neuronal activity and functional network connectivity in injured neurons."
10866425,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the fastest growing neurological disorder and its worldwide prevalence is expected
to double by the year 2040, a trend that some have labeled the “PD pandemic.” Disease disease-modifying
therapies and better methods of detection in early or pre-symptomatic phases are desperately needed and
data from human genetic studies have moved us much closer to those goals. Unfortunately, such studies have
largely excluded individuals of non-European origin which risks further worsening existing health disparities for
minority populations. The project seeks to address this gap in knowledge by studying the genetic architecture
of PD in African American and Latino participants in the Million Veteran Program (MVP) and other cohorts.
The research team assembled for this project has extensive expertise in clinical movement disorders,
bioinformatics, molecular genetics, and statistical genetics with specialized knowledge in mapping disease
genes in “admixed” (mixed ancestry) populations. This same group of investigators recently published the first
and only admixture mapping analysis and genome-wide association study (GWAS) of PD ever conducted in a
Latino population (based on a cohort from the Latin American Research Consortium on the Genetics of
Parkinson’s Disease [LARGE-PD]).
The fundamental approach will be to perform two complementary techniques (1) admixture mapping, a
technique that leverages local ancestry to identify regions of the genome where ancestry from a particular
ancestral population is inherited more frequently in cases vs controls, and (2) Tractor GWAS, a new analytical
approach that unlike traditional GWAS methods is designed to accommodate admixed individuals. A Discovery
sample will be created using cohorts from MVP and the Veterans Parkinson’s Disease Genetics Initiative (Vet-
PD) and a Replication sample will be assembled from LARGE-PD and several publicly available datasets.
Admixture mapping and Tractor GWAS will first be performed on the Discovery Sample, analyzing each
ancestry group separately and all groups combined. We will also perform the “variant-set test for association
using annotation information” (STAAR) to perform gene-centric association tests of rare variants that are not
suitable for single-marker analyses (such as GWAS). These processes will be repeated in the Replication
sample to validate results. Prioritization of candidate regions discovered will be performed using a combination
of (1) physical position on the genome (positional mapping), (2) expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL)
mapping, and (3) chromatin interaction mapping.
In addition, polygenic risk scores (PRS) will be calculated. A PRS is an estimate of an individual’s genetic
liability to a trait or disease, calculated according to their genotype profile and relevant GWAS data. These
scores have been applied to an increasing number of diseases with the eventual goal of risk stratification
followed by clinical interventions. But PRS models based on GWAS results from individuals of European origin
are often less accurate when applied to non-European populations. Therefore, PRS models will be
constructed from the European, African, and Latino components of the Discovery sample and their
performance will be compared across all three subgroups (e.g., Latino to African American and Latino to
European American). Finally, findings from this project will be cross-validated with results from any other
suitable studies that become available in future years.
Results from this project will provide a better understanding of the genetic architecture of PD in African
Americans and Latinos which is important for two reasons. First it moves the field closer to a more equitable
balance in the application of genetic information to clinical decisions in future years (e.g., PRS models).
Second, it begins to unlock the potential for new PD gene discovery in non-European populations which will
further our understanding of PD pathophysiology."
10875558,"PROGRAM ABSTRACT: Integrated mass spectrometry-based chemoproteomic and genomic technolo-
gies for studying dynamic kinase interactomes
 Dynamic changes in protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions (PPIs and PDIs) control most cellular pro-
cesses, including cell signaling and transcription; devastating diseases rewire PPI and PDI networks to drive
disease progression, therapy resistance, and immune escape. Novel methods for mapping dynamic interaction
networks are, therefore, urgently required to identify disease mechanisms and drug targets. Protein kinases are
critical regulatory nodes in most cellular PPI and PDI networks, are often dysregulated in disease, and are highly
druggable with synthetic, ATP-competitive inhibitors. Accordingly. insights into how diseases utilize kinases to
rewire PPI and PDI networks are extremely relevant for combating many diseases. Advances in quantitative
mass spectrometry (MS) have revolutionized proteomics, yet, facile methods for the systematic, sensitive, and
high-throughput profiling of kinase PPIs, locus-specific PDIs, and their dynamics are lacking. We will develop
transformative methods that combine cell-permeable affinity probes with chemical crosslinking and proximity
labeling to globally encode kinase interactomes in situ, followed by integrated LC-MS and sequencing analyses.
 Cellular plasticity drives physiological and pathological de- and transdifferentiation, and lineage switching,
critically contributing to development, tissue repair, cancer metastasis, organ fibrosis, and therapy and immune
escape in numerous diseases. To identify drug targets for combating these disease phenotypes, we pressingly
need to understand the signaling and transcriptional network that underly cellular plasticity. Our studies of patho-
logical kinome rewiring linked ~20% of human kinases to cellular plasticity, among them numerous understudied
kinases. We found that 70% these kinases localize to the nucleus and interact with transcription factors and
chromatin remodelers. We also found that cellular plasticity dynamically alters the post-translational modifica-
tions (PTMs) and PPIs of these kinases. How plasticity pathways coordinate dynamic changes in PTM, PPI and
PDI networks to systematically alter chromatin states and transcription, however, remains largely unknown, leav-
ing critical molecular mechanisms and drug targets unexplored. We will develop streamlined workflows for stud-
ying nuclear kinase dynamics, combining kinobead/LC-MS kinome profiling with global proteomics, epigenomics,
and transcriptomics analyses, and our novel interactomic platforms, and apply these workflows to unravel how
plasticity pathways spatiotemporally control kinases during cellular de- and transdifferentiation.
 To summarize, our program seeks to develop novel bioanalytical methods and workflows to systematically
study dynamic kinase interactomes, and to illuminate the mechanisms of pathological cellular plasticity. Pursuing
our goals, we created an ambitious, rigorous, and productive research program that fosters inclusiveness and
creativity, training the next generation of scientific leaders in proteomics, cell signaling, and chemical biology."

Horizontal gene transfer (HGT), specifically plasmid conjugation, is a driving force in microbial evolution
and pathogenesis. The process of conjugation appears deceptively simple: a donor cell transfers a copy
of a plasmid to a compatible recipient cell through a physical mating bridge. In doing so, diverse traits,
such as metabolic, virulence, and antibiotic resistance genes, can be spread. As such, HGT has been
implicated in a variety of human health and industrial applications, ranging from multi-drug resistance to
bioremediation. Advances in microbiome studies have revealed that HGT occurs between both closely
and distantly related strains, yielding a wide diversity of potential strain/plasmid combinations; despite
this, epidemiological surveillance clearly demonstrates that only a small minority of clones and their
associated plasmids persist in situ and are highly conserved across different ecological, geographical,
and clinical contexts. Thus, it is widely believed that the overall fitness of individual strain-plasmid pairs
is a key feature of successful pathogens. Fundamentally, this success is driven by a dynamic interaction
between a plasmid-carrying donor and suitable recipient strain in a favorable environment, resulting in
the formation of new strain-plasmid pairs (e.g., transconjugants). However, research to date has primarily
focused on established strain-plasmid combinations (e.g., donor capabilities and/or plasmid fitness
costs); in contrast, the dynamics and factors favoring the initial formation of these combinations
are entirely unknown. Yet, such information is critical to both predict new pathogen emergence and
develop strategies that intervene in plasmid acquisition before they become established in a population.
To address this gap, my research program leverages our unique interdisciplinary expertise in
computational modeling, bioinformatics, and mechanistic experiments to investigate the molecular
factors favoring the formation of new strain-plasmid combinations. Our proposed themes approach this
problem from three complementary perspectives: (1) What genetic features make certain plasmids
harder/easier to acquire? (2) What determines a strain’s potential to act as a good HGT recipient? (3)
How does environmental selection impact plasmid acquisition capabilities? Combined, these parallel
objectives work towards a unified framework that integrates insights across multiple levels of complexity
(i.e., molecular to ecological/evolutionary). These research directions contribute to our long-term goal,
one that is central to the NIGMS mission, of reliably predicting (and ultimately controlling) clinically
relevant strain/plasmid prevalence, and will eventually enable us to anticipate pathogen emergence a
priori and explore downstream applications, e.g., novel antibiotic treatment strategies."
10889213,"Project Summary
 Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile genetic elements that can propagate within the host DNA and have
a significant impact on the genome organization and function. TEs are ubiquitous across the tree of life and
occupy substantial fractions of animal genomes - about 20% of the D. melanogaster, and 45-50% of human and
mouse genomes consist of TE fragments that have accumulated throughout evolution, and active TEs are a
major source of genetic and epigenetic variation. Despite their prevalence, TEs’ unusual characteristics and high
copy numbers left them poorly annotated, and among the most enigmatic and understudied genetic elements.
 TEs are typically seen as harmful, as their mobility causes DNA damage and can impact the host genome
and transcriptome by directly disrupting functional elements or introducing ectopic binding sites for transcriptional
and epigenetic regulators. To prevent their deleterious activities, TEs are targeted by various silencing
mechanisms. Among these, the piRNA pathway enforces transcriptional and post-transcription repression of TEs
in animal germlines, which is crucial for fertility and preserving the integrity of genetic information across
generations. On the other hand, TEs are an important source of evolutionary innovation and there is a growing
body of literature on TE-derived regulatory regions and functional products that became incorporated into host
regulatory networks. Interestingly, early embryogenesis of both vertebrates and invertebrates is characterized
by a spike of TE activity, and at least in mice, timely activation of specific TEs is essential for normal
developmental progression. However, the diversity of products from TEs and their functional roles in somatic
cells in both systems remain poorly characterized, largely owing to long-standing technical difficulties in the
genomic analysis of elements that exist in high copy numbers.
 The molecular mechanisms of TE regulation and the functional implications of TE activity are central areas
of interest for my laboratory. I present a research program that addresses key questions within two major aspects
of TE biology: 1) the mechanism and regulation of piRNA-mediated TE silencing in the germline and 2) the
characteristics and functions of somatic TE expression during development, using the classic model Drosophila
as a paradigm. First, I propose a focused strategy to dissect the regulation and function of several key piRNA
pathway components, building on my previous findings that protein SUMOylation plays essential roles in piRNA
biogenesis and TE silencing. In parallel, I plan to leverage state-of-the-art long-read and single-cell sequencing
technologies to overcome historical limitations to the genomic analysis of the TE-derived transcriptome, with the
long-term goal of elucidating the molecular basis and functional consequences of somatic TE activity in the
developing organism."
10932864,"Summer (i.e., May-August) is a period of accelerated BMI gain that leads to increases in childhood obesity. Two
theories may explain accelerated summer BMI gain. The Circadian and Circannual Rhythm Model (CCRM) posits
that BMI gain during summer is biologically driven by the shifting light-dark cycle, with BMI gain accelerating during
the summer when days are longer and weight gain outpaces height gain and decelerating during the winter when
days are shorter and height gain outpaces weight gain. The Structured Days Hypothesis (SDH) proposes that
accelerations in BMI gain during the summer are due to the removal of the structured school day (i.e., school vs
no school during summer) which influences children’s engagement in key obesogenic behaviors (physical activity,
sedentary/screen time, dietary intake, and sleep). Breaks throughout the school year (1-week fall break, 2-week
winter break, 1-week spring break) may also cause accelerated BMI gain. Current accelerated BMI gain research
is focused exclusively on summer vs. school year comparisons. These studies measure children in the spring (May
prior to summer) and fall (August following summer) exclusively, allowing only for comparisons of BMI gain between
the 3 months of summer and the other 9 months of the year. It does not allow for the measure of decelerations in
BMI gain predicted by the CCRM during the winter, nor does it allow for the measure of accelerations in BMI gain
during the fall, winter, and spring breaks predicted by the SDH. This is a critical limitation in our understanding of
WHEN childhood obesity occurs and HOW to treat it. This study will overcome these limitations by identifying
monthly patterns in the accelerations and decelerations of children’s height, weight, and BMI gain and the
associated behavioral, social, environmental, and biological determinates. We will recruit 3 cohorts (3K,
Kindergarten, and Second grade) of 200 children (600 children in total) to participate in a cohort-sequential design.
We will collect BMI monthly; obesogenic behaviors (physical activity, sedentary/screen time, dietary intake, and
sleep) in the spring, summer, fall, and winter; and social, environmental, and biological information over three years
for each cohort. The cohort-sequential design will allow us to map BMI development and seasonal shifts in
behaviors 3K to 5th grade. We will accomplish the following specific aims: Aim 1: Identify monthly variations in height,
weight, and BMI change in a large and diverse cohort of children (3K to 5th grade, N=600). Aim 2: Examine the
relationship between monthly patterns of height, weight, and BMI change with seasonal (fall, winter, spring, summer)
patterns in obesogenic behaviors. Aim 3 Exploratory: Examine the relationship of social, environmental, and biological
factors with patterns in behaviors and variations in height, weight, and BMI z-score change. This project is significant
because it fills a major gap (monthly patterns of BMI z-score gain) in the knowledge about the development of
childhood obesity, a widespread public health crisis. This project is innovative because it will be among the first
studies to measure BMI gain monthly along with the associated behavioral, social, environmental, and biological
determinates that predict accelerated/decelerated BMI gain."
10915527,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Complex traits result from interactions between many genetic and environmental factors. Nonetheless, most
complex trait studies assume an additive model, in which genetic effects are independent of the environment
and each other. This simple model has successfully identified many trait-associated loci, and these loci can be
combined into Polygenic Scores (PGS) to predict disease. However, these results have not generally identified
novel disease biology or therapies. Worse yet, PGS are biased toward European ancestry-individuals, hence
clinical use of current PGS will exacerbate existing health disparities.
I hypothesize that genetic interactions are the missing link in our understanding of complex trait biology. Genetic
interactions are central to many fields of biology, and it is not likely that complex human traits are fundamentally
different. However, prior studies of genetic interactions have generally been unsuccessful. I argue this results
from limitations in our current models. In the next five years, I will develop genetic interaction models for complex
traits to address these limitations.
First, I will develop models to identify gene-gene interaction at the level of pathway-pathway interaction that build
on my recent “Coordinated” framework for epistasis. Coordination is biologically plausible and statistically
powerful. I will extend my Coordinated models to decompose pleiotropic effects on multiple traits and to unravel
subtypes of common diseases.
Second, I will develop rigorous and powerful models of gene-environment interaction that apply to novel areas
of complex trait genetics. I will study cell type-specific heritability in single cell ‘omics data, I will incorporate
context-specific effects to improve power and portability in PGS, and I will quantify the heritability of treatment
response from biobank data.
My methods will be mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient. They will build on my track record of
developing robust and freely-distributed statistical genetics methods. I will apply my methods to phenome-wide
scans in diverse cohorts, especially to quantify the portability of PGS across ancestries. I will also study Major
Depressive Disorder in detail, a classic example of a heterogeneous complex disorder with a mix of poorly
understood genetic and environmental causes. My interaction methods will close the gap between statistical
explanation and biological understanding, revealing new paths to precision medicine that benefit everyone."

Repetitive DNA, especially that due to transposable elements (TEs), makes up a large fraction of many genomes.
Thorough and accurate annotation of repetitive content in genomes depends on a comprehensive database of
known TEs, along with robust statistical and procedural methods for recognizing decayed instances of elements
and disentangling their complex relationships.
Annotation of TE instances is usually performed using our RepeatMasker software, which compares a genome
to a database containing representations of known repeat families. These have historically been consensus
sequences, which generally approximate the sequences of the original TEs. Our Dfam database is an open
access collection of repetitive DNA families, in which each family is represented by a multiple sequence
alignment and a profile hidden Markov model (HMM). We have demonstrated that profile HMMs support
improved annotation sensitivity, and Dfam provides numerous aids to both curators of TE families and those who
make use of the resulting annotations.
During the life of this grant, the database has grown to include families belonging to more than 1000 species
(from a baseline of 5). This growth has introduced a number of scale-based pressures, which in some cases
have forced us to reduce Dfam functionality in response, and in other cases highlighted ways that the resource
can better meet the needs of the community. Our proposed efforts largely target these matters while continuing
to expand and diversify the resource."

This project aims to address the current gap in technology for rapid and comprehensive (mass,
structure) profiling of biomacromolecules. While high resolution ion mobility and mass spectrometry
separations techniques have been extensively developed, their application has been largely limited to
small molecules (m/z < 2000). The ability to access structure and mass information in a high-throughput
fashion for macrobiomolecules is an aspirational goal in mass spectrometry. In pursuance of this goal,
we will develop a high-resolution ion mobility chemical analysis device based on Structures for Lossless
Ion Manipulations, and in conjunction with mass spectrometry obtain high-throughput high-resolution
IMS/MS of biomacromolecules. The study of the significant heterogeneity in large biomolecular
systems, i.e., macrobiomolecules, critical to biological research will be enabled by the development of
a new high resolution, high throughput analytical system. The SLIM platform, currently enabled for
ultra-high resolution ion mobility profiling (up to the point of separating isotopomers and isotopologues)
and manipulations of small molecular ions (<3000 Daltons) will be optimized to efficiently confine,
transport and separate macrobiomolecules. Initial optimization of the SLIM will be done by coupling
with a TOF-MS system. SLIM-TOF will be used to perform high resolution IMS/MS of ensembles of
macrobiomolecular species (with an upper mass limit of about 20,000 Da dictated by the TOF). We will
use SLIM-based IMS separations and other manipulations to reveal the extensive structural
heterogeneity of macrobiomolecules. Further, we will perform size and mass selective soft-landing of
macrobiomolecules using the dynamic switching and rerouting (to deposition substrates) of a selective
ion mobility distribution in the SLIM. The soft-landed species will be characterized using cryo-EM and
complimentary imaging techniques to elucidate the morphologies of macrobiomolecules with selected
mobilities or collision-cross-sections. The combination of ion mobility information and imaging will
provide a detailed structural characterization of macrobiomolecules."

measures of success and our continual self-assessment process, we propose a renewal for an additional five-
year period of support. Our focused goal remains devoted to train a cadre of highly skilled, interactive scientists
who can successfully address the new opportunities in dental, oral, and craniofacial research and become a part
of the future academic faculty in US dental schools.
Our Aims are to: 1) to recruit outstanding trainees from a diverse pool of applicants; 2) to train them in rigorous,
transparent, ethical state-of-the-art research methods, including team science; and 3) to nurture them in a culture
of translational science. The COSTAR program will offer three integrated training tracks: 1) DDS/PhD program,
2) PhD program, and 3) Postdoctoral research fellowships. These three training tracks are provided in three
integrated thematic areas by a highly selected, research intensive, and collaborative, Program Faculty
representing the best mentors across the Dental, Medical, and Graduate Schools at UTHSCSA, and united by
their shared interest in Craniofacial Oral Biology research. Thus, COSTAR serves as a strong institutional nexus
for an exceptional multi- and inter- disciplinary research and training environment further enhancing the
institutional infrastructure for research in Dental, Oral and Craniofacial Biology. Highly motivated and dedicated
students and fellows who are selected for research training in the COSTAR program will participate in a series
of COSTAR core courses and experiences that are integrated with programs across the Dental School and the
campus at large. Importantly, COSTAR-sponsored activities yield a strong programmatic identity, collaboration,

Most Americans past middle age are taking one or more common drugs, and these drugs may have hidden
impacts on their subsequent risk of major health outcomes like cancer or Alzheimer's disease. Discovering
such drug effects could improve disease prevention and suggest drug repurposing opportunities. One
approach to this end is to follow the outcomes of people taking each common drug, as recorded in health
records data. While health data is growing in size and detail, it is noisy and incomplete. There is a critical need
for new methods to discover drug effects from existing data sources. We propose novel systematic approaches
to assess drug-wide association with cancer or Alzheimer's disease by modeling the health record. One
innovative concept is our parallel efforts mining independent genetics data. We hypothesize drug side effects
can be predicted by analysis of pathological processes shared between the drug's original use and the side
effect disease. Analyzing evidence of shared etiology between health conditions and cancer or dementia, we
will test this hypothesis. Our efforts to systematically discover drug effects from independent health data and

putative drug effects on a late-onset disease. While many data-driven studies leave evaluation of the results to

their findings.

Gene expression in bacteria is heterogeneous even within genetically identical cells due to the stochastic
activation of many gene regulatory programs. The resulting phenotypic diversity often plays an important
functional role for bacterial communities, for example, facilitating horizontal gene transfer. This fundamentally
single-cell behavior cannot be resolved with population level measurements and, so far, has been studied in
pure cultures of genetically tractable organisms using low-throughput reporter-based assays. However, the
majority of bacteria in nature reside in complex microbial communities spatially organized into biofilms and
composed of multiple interacting members. Within such communities, a multitude of behaviors emerge from the
dynamic interplay of noisy gene expression states and responses to the heterogeneous microenvironment.
Absence of approaches for measuring phenotypic states within complex polymicrobial communities
simultaneously at systems scale and with single-cell resolution results in a lack of mechanistic understanding of
bacterial ecology and is therefore a critical barrier for the fields of microbiology and microbiome studies. During
my postdoc, I developed a high-throughput bacterial single-cell transcriptomics technology, microSPLiT
(microbial Split-Pool Ligation Transcriptomics), that allows to measure gene expression states in tens of
thousands of individual cells using only common laboratory equipment. In my lab, I aim to further extend
microSPLiT for single-cell transcriptomics of biofilms, as well as of complex bacterial consortia. Specifically, in
my first project we will create a single-cell gene expression map of single- and dual-species biofilms of
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus by a combination of spatial single-cell RNA sequencing
and time-lapse imaging. We will characterize where and how the specialized phenotypic subpopulations emerge
at different stages of biofilm development and how they change in response to competing species. In the second
project, we will interrogate the functional role of the intermittent and heterogeneous activation of diverse
metabolic and stress response pathways which we have observed even in isogenic cells and in absence of
external cues. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that heterogeneous sampling of such states may promote
inter-species interactions with bacterial partners evolved to coexist in the same environment. In this project, I
aim to uncover the phenotypic subpopulations arising in key species from human gut microbiota grown either
solo or in pair-wise combinations with other co-occurring species. With these data, we will use gene regulatory
network modeling to predict the higher-order interactions between gut microbiota species and engineer higher
complexity consortia with predictable behavioral traits. The results will pave the way toward building systems-
level understanding of the phenotypic structure and the emergent properties of a higher complexity natural

and the acquired data will provide a foundation for high-resolution functional analyses of microbiota and biofilms."

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer among both men and women and the second
leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States (US). CRC screening is now recommended for average-
risk adults ages 45-75, yet many adults in the US are not within screening guidelines. One recommended CRC
screening approach is annual completion of a fecal immunochemical test (FIT). FIT can be completed at home
and sent/returned via mail, making mailed FIT programs a promising way to reach people and increase CRC
screening. Such programs may be especially important for geographic regions with lower access to healthcare
and lack of public transportation, such as the Appalachian region of the US. Mailed FIT programs have been
shown to increase CRC screening, but typically fewer than half of participants in these programs who were
sent a FIT returned a completed test. This indicates that mailed FIT programs can be greatly improved upon by
addressing common barriers to FIT return. A key next step in this field of research is to identify strategies that
can address these barriers and subsequently increase FIT return in mailed programs.
Our study team will build on our past research and take this key next step. In doing so, we will partner with
health centers in Appalachian counties that are located in a CRC “hotspot” within the US (i.e., clusters of
counties with high CRC rates). The proposed study will involve a mailed FIT program (called “FIT Starts at 45”)
that includes 500 participants from Appalachia who are underscreened and ages 45-74. We will determine the
efficacy and cost-effectiveness of two potential strategies for increasing FIT return: FIT kit materials (enhanced
FIT kit that includes a video brochure vs. standard FIT kit) and patient navigation (PN) delivery mode (text
message PN vs. telephone PN). In a 2x2 between-subjects factorial randomized trial, each participant will be
randomized to one of the following study groups: standard FIT kit plus telephone PN; standard FIT kit plus text
message PN; enhanced FIT kit plus telephone PN; or enhanced FIT kit plus text message PN. The proposed
study will be one of the most innovative and comprehensive mailed FIT programs to date in the US, with each
study aim making a significant research contribution. Aim 1 will determine the efficacy of FIT kit materials and
PN delivery mode on increasing FIT return. FIT return will be defined as return of a completed FIT by
participants within six weeks of FIT distribution. Aim 2 will determine if efficacy differs across key
characteristics of participants and their communities (i.e., moderation). Aim 3 will compare the cost-
effectiveness of FIT kit materials and PN delivery mode on increasing FIT return. Results will be impactful by
providing an evidence base that can help optimize the design, implementation, scalability, and sustainability of
future mailed FIT programs, including our own efforts to disseminate the FIT Starts at 45 program."
10893039,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Migraine is the most common neurological disorder in the world characterized by episodes of severe headache
accompanied by a variety of symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and depression of activity. Despite its
prevalence, treatments for migraine are poor. Nonspecific analgesics such as opioids and nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) produce pain relief, but repeated may produce addiction and gastric ulcers,
respectively. Traditional treatments for migraine such as triptans (serotonin receptor agonists) are plagued by
side effects, while repeated use of certain anti-migraine treatments worsen headache in a condition known as
medication-overuse headache (MOH). Thus, there is a desperate need for new non-opioid anti-migraine agents
with novel mechanisms of action. To this end, we aim to develop dual inhibitors, single small molecules that will
simultaneously inhibit two pain-related enzymes: soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) and fatty acid amide hydrolase
(FAAH). The most original and mechanistically distinct aspect of these compounds is their ability to inhibit two
different enzymes that play significant roles in pain and inflammation within the trigeminovascular system
simultaneously. Dual sEH/FAAH inhibitors described here have the potential to be used as a promising novel
non-opioid anti-migraine strategy. Our undergraduate students have identified several very potent dual inhibitors
and tested our lead inhibitor in vivo to demonstrate antinociception in a rat model of acute inflammatory pain.
We also observed that this dual inhibitor produces antinociception at lower doses than traditional NSAID
ketoprofen and does not produce behaviorally disruptive side effects. In the proposed studies we will rigorously
evaluate our two lead dual inhibitors in a rat model of migraine pain, synthesize and evaluate novel libraries of
ligands that are designed to interact simultaneously with both target enzymes, assess the anti-migraine effects
of these new ligands, and evaluate whether administration of our dual inhibitors produce opioid-like rewarding
effects or medication overuse headache. The compounds we propose to study represent a completely novel
non-opioid, groundbreaking effort in anti-migraine treatments. Because this class has different biological targets
from existing treatments, it represents an opportunity to solve long-standing problems that have been linked to
the existing anti-migraine therapies (e.g., opioids, triptans). To our knowledge, this proposal is the first attempt
to use the strategy of dual sEH/FAAH inhibitors as a rational anti-migraine therapeutic strategy. In addition, the
design principles, synthetic and in vivo strategies behind these dual inhibitors are truly multi-disciplinary,
rigorous, comprehensive, and innovative. Our studies will provide a firm foundation for the future investigation of
using this dual ligand strategy as a treatment for migraine pain. This proposal represents collaborative work
between two Hispanic-serving institutions, Cal State East Bay and Cal State Fullerton, with mentorship from the
Center for Clinical Pharmacology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. Our multidisciplinary
team has expertise and resources to tackle this project on the horizon to ensure continued success."
10917156,"SUMMARY
Water is the medium in which biochemistry operates. The amount of water inside a cell defines the concentration
of all biomolecules and the degree of molecular crowding. Consequently, water content is predicted to influence
virtually all cell functions from immune surveillance to stem cell renewal in vivo. There are also severe genetic
diseases caused by mutated water channels on cell membranes. Despite the fundamental role of cellular water
content in cell physiology and diseases, there are no direct and non-invasive methods that measure how much
water a single cell or a cluster of cells, such as an organoid, contains. This lack of water content measurements
has prevented us from understanding cell physiology in normal and disease states, and from discovering drugs
that can modulate cellular water content in diseases where water content is perturbed. Here, we propose to
develop a new method that will directly, non-invasively and precisely measure the absolute and fractional (v/v)
water content of a single cell or an organoid. This method will enable the long-term monitoring of the same cell
or organoid during growth, differentiation or drug exposure. To achieve this, we will integrate total volume and
dry volume measurements obtained using two independent approaches that we have previously developed. Our
proposed method will enable water content measurements in complex and biomedically relevant samples, such
as immune cells and organoids, with high throughput and in conjunction with detection of fluorescent markers.
This method will enable novel basic and biomedical research that will increase our understanding of water
content regulation in health and disease, and provide a new platform for drug discovery."
10908409,"Project Summary/Abstract
Organ surfaces are covered with epithelial cells or endothelial cells, providing physical barriers for organs and
bodies. Cells on these confluent layers often remain static and non-migratory. However, they can also undergo
active structural rearrangements during basic physiological processes ranging across embryonic development,
morphogenesis, repair, and remodeling. In each of these events, an epithelial collective necessarily undergoes
a transition from a solid-like state which is quiescent and non-migratory to a fluid-like state which is dynamic and
migratory. This striking transition between non-migratory versus migratory behaviors is traditionally studied in
the context of cells on a flat surface in 2D. These collective cellular behaviors have been widely explored in
monolayers of epithelial cells that form two-dimensional (2D) flat surfaces, from both biophysics and cell biology
perspectives. However, they are not well-adapted to make predictions for natural epithelia, which are typically
found to form highly curved surfaces, where the radius of curvature can be comparable to a few cell lengths.
Epithelial tissues also comprise various topologies – spheres, ellipsoids, tubes, and saddle points — in native
structures such as embryos, alveoli, airways, vessels, and branching bifurcations. How surface curvature affects
the way a cell collective moves remains largely unknown; furthermore, how cells become jammed and unjammed
during the maturation of a cell monolayer growing on a curved surface remains unclear. Further, whereas
previous modeling efforts have focused more on the mechanics and migratory behavior of cells within a single
monolayer, the mammalian epidermis is a multilayered epithelial tissue. Although the developing epidermis is
highly dynamic, the time-dependent mechanics (i.e., rheology) of epidermal development remains elusive. There
are two key unresolved questions: (1) what cues drive epidermal development, and (2) how does the mechanics
of the epidermis depend on the timescale of measurement? There is an urgent need to develop theoretical and
computational models for these critical scenarios. I will develop an integrated computation modeling framework
to elucidate the biomechanics of collective cell behavior beyond the conventionally studied two-dimensional
settings, including curved surfaces and multilayered 3D epidermis. I will also create a novel model that addresses
the biomechanical couplings between nuclear morphologies and epithelial proliferation."
10907560,"Project Summary/Abstract
Understanding the spatial landscape of gene expression in tissues is a fundamental question for human health
and disease. Applications range from identifying the spatial organization of cell types to dysregulation of
spatial-dependent gene expression associated with disease. Advances in technologies, such as
spatially-resolved transcriptomics (SRT), provide a wealth of data to investigate these questions. Furthermore,
SRT combined with advances in long-read RNA-sequencing enable applications such as identifying
spatial-dependent splicing variation and allele speciﬁcity in healthy and disease states, such as cancer or
neurodegenerative disorders. Recent SRT studies are generating datasets across multiple samples (different
donors or adjacent tissue sections), but researchers analyze samples independently because there lack
computational tools for datasets with multiple samples. In contrast, when samples are jointly analyzed together,
the statistical power is increased to detect differences with greater accuracy and precision. The lack of tools to
analyze SRT data with multiple samples is a signiﬁcant knowledge gap that limits are ability to reﬁne the
molecular causes and consequences of diseases that can be targeted for prevention and treatment.
My research program develops scalable computational methods and open-source software for biomedical data
analysis, in particular single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data, leading to an improved understanding of
human health and disease. Here, our goal is to focus on developing scalable computational methods and
software for data from spatial and long-read technologies with multiple samples and experimental conditions to
accurately (1) predict spatial domains of tissues across multiple samples, (2) identify differences in spatial gene
expression across experimental conditions or biological groups with multiple samples in each group, and (3)
identify differential splicing variation across spatial domains or experimental conditions.
The rationale for the proposed work is that the computational tools developed will enable substantial advances
in our understanding of the spatial landscape of gene expression on distinct scales from cells to tissues to
individuals. The signiﬁcance of this proposal is substantial with broad impact for researchers increasingly using
these imaging and genomic data, such as large-scale consortia generating spatial atlases across multiple
samples, but also the proposed methods will be relevant to a wide variety of scientiﬁc disciplines that leverage
high-dimensional data in a spatial context, such as environmental and mobile health. The project builds on my
past experience in developing computational methods and open-source software for scalable clustering and
identifying differences in gene expression at the single-cell level. The creation of well-documented, open-source
software expands the impact of this work to other researchers aiming to understand the spatial landscape of
gene expression in a variety of disease settings."
10930845,"Project Summary
To survive in diverse environments, bacteria must dynamically interact with their physical surroundings to sense
and incorporate stimuli into physiological responses. Bacteria often achieve this interplay between extracellular
cues and intracellular signaling by using surface-exposed nanomachines that connect the intracellular space to
the cell surface. The most broadly distributed surface-exposed nanomachines are appendages called type IV
pili (T4P) and evolutionarily related structures that are believed to have diverged from an ancient nanomachine
found in the last universal common ancestor. T4P are highly dynamic, employing multiple molecular motors to
power cycles of extension and retraction that are essential for many behaviors, making them an ideal system for
understanding the dynamic exchange between cells and their physical environments. Despite their broad
distribution and importance in many biological processes, little is known about the fundamental biology behind
T4P dynamics, regulation, and structure. We will use a combination of genetics, cell biology, biophysics, and
biochemical techniques to dissect the fundamental biology of T4P. We will employ multiple model organisms
including Caulobacter crescentus, Vibrio cholerae, and Acinetobacter species that all produce T4P for a
comparative biology approach across different T4P. Our prior experience and expertise working in these systems
will enable us to interrogate how T4P regulatory mechanisms evolve to respond to environmental stimuli and
how these regulatory differences influence behavioral outputs. Our five-year goals include understanding the
basic mechanisms driving T4P dynamics, how dynamics are regulated, and the consequences of different
regulatory mechanisms on bacterial behavior and physiology. This work will address several key questions,
including: 1) what are the main factors influencing dynamics? 2) what mechanisms control subcellular localization
and patterning? And 3) how do structural subunits of T4P determine their functional and mechanical properties
to influence diverse behavioral outputs? This work will provide critical insight into T4P regulation and dynamics
that will result in better understanding of the physical interactions between cells and their environments and
enable the development of tools to hinder or control T4P function in the broad bacterial behaviors they elicit. The
fundamental discoveries made through our study of T4P will also reveal general aspects of biology including
insight into the underlying mechanics of molecular motors, the mechanisms controlling intracellular spatial
organization, and the relationship between protein structure and function."
10872299,"Project Summary/Abstract
The focus of this proposal is on excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) in skeletal muscle. The ECC consists of a
series of physiological events linking the depolarization of muscle cell’s plasma membrane to the release of Ca2+
from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) into cytoplasm, resulting in muscle contraction. ECC is restricted spatially
to a subcompartment of muscle cells (‘triad junction’) and regulated precisely via a physical interaction between
the voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (dihydropyridine receptor, DHPR) on the plasma membrane and the Ca2+-release
channel (type 1 ryanodine receptor, RyR1) in the SR. Many drugs currently in use to treat muscle disorders
target these two Ca2+ channels. Despite recent remarkable advances in the structural characterization of these
two channels, the molecular mechanisms underlying their interactions remain elusive due to the lack of detailed
3D architecture of the ECC machinery comprising both channels and associated regulatory proteins. Determining
architecture of such multiprotein complexes is a formidable challenge given their native location in lipid
membranes and the lack a general means to preserve the complex integrity upon extraction with detergents from
their lipid bilayer environment. In this project, we will address this challenge by utilizing advanced cryogenic
electron tomography (cryoET) to study frozen-hydrated triad junctions isolated from skeletal muscle (aim 1) as
well as within myotubes cultured on EM grids (aim 2). To accomplish these studies, we endeavor to develop the
experimental workflow for in situ cryoET analysis of the ECC complex. This workflow will consist of the following
major steps: preparation of the membrane-embedded ECC complexes suitable for cryoET analysis; cryoET data
collection, image analysis, tomographic reconstruction and subtomogram averaging; visualization and
annotation of densities in cryo-tomograms. The determined structures will reveal mechanistically informative
features underlying protein-protein interactions in the ECC Ca2+ release complex that will allow important
functional insights into the ECC process. In the future, we will apply the workflow developed here to structure-
functional characterization of ECC in different types of muscle and under pathological conditions. Overall, the
proposed studies are highly significant, as they will provide mechanistic structural insights into the ECC
machinery illuminating the pathological consequences of deregulated Ca2+ signaling, that will ultimately aid in
search for novel therapies targeting neuromuscular diseases. The workflow developed, as part of this research
will have broad applicability to studies of other integral membrane protein complexes."
10915565,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Advances in technology are enabling the collection of massive datasets of millions of human genomes. The
long-term vision underlying this proposal is to leverage modern datasets and machine learning (ML) to under-
stand how genetics and the environment determine traits and outcomes important to improving human health.
Modern ML thrives on vast datasets of millions of unstructured datapoints (genomes, clinical notes, images),
and stands to greatly impact statistical genetics, the field which studies the genotype-phenotype link. Improve-
ments in statistical genetics have in turn the potential to elucidate the genetic basis of disease and support per-
sonalized medical therapies.
This proposal advances the above vision via two thrusts: (1) developing novel machine learning (ML) algo-
rithms motivated by problems in statistical genetics; (2) creating open-source software systems for scientists
and clinicians based on the above algorithms. Specifically, we describe a plan for the development of computa-
tional methods in three broad areas in statistical genetics: modeling linkage disequilibrium and the structure of
genetic variation, analyzing genome-wide association study data, and predicting risk from genetic and environ-
mental factors. Within in each area, we aim to develop open-source software for key applied problems includ-
ing genetic imputation, haplotyping, low-pass sequencing, causal variant identification, and risk scoring.
Our research seeks to establish a foundation for statistical genetics based on modern ML and also advance
ML in directions that may not be pursued in other application domains. Our methods will support technologies
that have immediate applications in healthcare and that help reveal novel genetic factors that influence dis-
ease; improve the accuracy of genomic prediction in domains from preventive medicine to pharmacogenomics;
significantly reduce the cost of genomic sequencing assays, and ultimately improve human health."

The ACCEL CTR Program has successfully met the expectations of this award mechanism by expanding
the capacity for clinical and translational research in Delaware and enhancing our investigators’ ability to
successfully compete for extramural funding in this arena. The success of ACCEL is anchored in the
complementary strengths of the partnership network been built over the past nine years. Our current
network consists of the University of Delaware (lead institution), Christiana Care Health System,
Nemours Children’s Health and Delaware State University—an American, historically Black, public
university. To date, ACCEL has established an exceedingly strong network and infrastructure for clinical
and translational research within Delaware; and, we are now poised and ready to continue our growth
trajectory by building a deeper focus on health equity into our clinical and translational research
infrastructure. The planned components of the ACCEL Program include the Administrative Core and five
other required Cores, including: the Professional Development Core; the Biostatistics, Epidemiology, &
Research Design Core; the Community Engagement & Outreach Core; the Pilot Projects Program, and
the Tracking and Evaluation Core. The overall goal of the Administrative Core is to improve the
efficiency, productivity and impact of the five other Cores so that we are able to successfully meet our
common mission of building clinical and translational research infrastructure that will be sustainable and
ultimately improve the health of Delawareans. We believe that we have a very effective administrative
structure that does not require substantial change. But, in this renewal application, we propose an
exciting new addition to the Administrative Core—a Health Equity Navigator, who will work closely with all
Core leaders to weave the thread of health equity throughout all aspects of the ACCEL program. The
Health Equity Navigator will keep the network focused on health equity as we strengthen our clinical and
translational research infrastructure. The Specific Aims of the Administrative Core are to continue to: (1)
Provide a flexible and efficient administrative and governance structure that enhances the DE-CTR
ACCEL Program’s ability to grow and sustain clinical and translational research programs that address
the most important health care needs of Delawareans and all Americans; (2) Manage the financial and
business operations of the DE-CTR ACCEL Program to ensure operational efficiency, sound fiscal health
of the organization and compliance with all federal, state and local regulations; (3) Enhance and promote
data-informed decision-making, communication and collaboration across all ACCEL components,
participating institutions and other IDeA programs; and (4) Facilitate the implementation of strategic, high-
value initiatives that will enhance the ACCEL Program’s ability to address health inequities and improve

The Tracking and Evaluation (TEVAL) Core of the Delaware ACCEL Clinical and Translational Research
Program (ACCEL-CTR) will facilitate and assess the success of building a sustainable clinical and translational
research infrastructure in Delaware. During ACCEL3, the priorities of TEVAL will move beyond defining metrics
and accounting for research productivity, which has been a high priority over the past nine years, and transition
to a greater focus on summative evaluation, reflective of the maturity of the ACCEL-CTR. The Specific Aims of
TEVAL are 1) Monitor and track metrics and key performance indicators of success; 2) Provide evaluation
support to CTR and Core leadership to facilitate continuous improvement; 3) Assess the impact of the ACCEL-
CTR utilizing multi-level impact studies, focusing on the individual, institutional, infrastructure, and community
health levels; and 4) Share best practices in evaluation and clinical and translational research within and
beyond Delaware. We will provide CTR and Core leadership with the information necessary to support data-
driven decision-making and to facilitate continuous improvement. TEVAL will examine how the ACCEL-CTR
has impacted investigator research capacity, research infrastructure, research collaborations, investments in
research addressing health equity and the health needs of Delawareans, as well as the translational impact of
funded projects in accordance with overall project aims. We will share best practices and lessons learned
through evaluation briefs, presentations, infographics, and publications. In addition, the Delaware TEVAL Core
leads the National CTR Evaluator’s Network and together with other CTR evaluators will share best practices
in translational research evaluation. The work of TEVAL will be guided by the American Evaluation
Association’s Guiding Principles for Evaluators: systematic inquiry, competence, integrity, respect for people,
and common good and equity. The ACCEL-CTR evaluation will incorporate multiple approaches into its
participatory, theory-based evaluation, including a concentration on the intended use of data by intended users
(utilization-focused evaluation) and iterative, flexible methods to address innovation and system complexity
(developmental evaluation). In addition, our initial planning during which indicators were built into the program’s
theory (embedded evaluation) and our intentional focus on intermediate and long-term results towards meeting
ACCEL-CTR aims (results-based accountability) are intended to provide our stakeholders with the necessary
information for summative decision-making. These methods enable TEVAL to provide high quality, actionable
analyses and reporting to leadership on outcomes and impacts regarding enhancing infrastructure,
strengthening research, fostering collaborations, and improving health and health equity in Delaware."
10929373,"Summary: Neovascular glaucoma (NVG) is a potentially blinding secondary glaucoma, characterized by the
development of neovascularization of the iris (NVI) and angle (NVA), leading to elevated intraocular pressure
(IOP) and poor visual prognosis. The underlying pathogenesis in most cases is posterior segment ischemia
secondary to retinal diseases including proliferative diabetic retinopathy, central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO)
and ocular ischemic syndrome, which are usually associated with an upregulated expression of angiogenic
factors in the posterior segment. When these factors diffuse to the anterior segment, they promote the growth
of abnormal blood vessels on the surface of the iris, causing NVI, and over the iris angle, causing NVA.
Maturation of these vessels can result in the formation of a fibrovascular membrane over the trabecular
meshwork that can obstruct aqueous outflow, resulting in an increase in IOP and the development of NVG.
Contraction of this fibrovascular membrane can lead to secondary angle closure glaucoma (ACG) with a
dramatic rise in IOP. Interestingly, the risk for NVG is directly proportional to the area of retinal ischemia,
supporting a role for hypoxia-regulated gene products in its development. Prompt diagnosis and effective
disease treatments in the early stages of the disease are crucial to reduce the chances of NVG and visual
impairment. Unfortunately, the large-scale destruction of ischemic retinal tissue with panretinal
photocoagulation (PRP) remains the preferred standard in the majority of eyes with NVG. Recently, VEGF
inhibitors used for the management of ischemic retinal diseases have been incorporated for NVG clinical
management, usually as adjuvants to PRP. However, these anti-VEGF agents result in only a temporary
regression of new vessels in the anterior chamber angle involved in NVI/NVA. In spite of tremendous progress
in the therapeutic management of NVG over the past decades, there are no effective therapies for the actively
growing or established disease. This underscores the urgency to identify the molecular mechanisms that
regulate NVI and NVA, to design more effective approaches for the prevention and management of NVG. Our
preliminary support a role for Angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4), a pro-angiogenic and vessel hyperpermeability
factor, and its novel receptor, Neuropilin 1, in the development of NVI/NVA and NVG. Our proposal intends to
investigate: Aim 1) the role of ANGPTL4 and its synergism with VEGFs in the promotion of iris
neovascularization in vitro and in vivo; Aim 2) the role of Neuropilin inhibitors as antiangiogenic factors in iris
neovascularization in vitro and in vivo; Aim 3) how the expression of VEGF, ANGPTL4, and sNRP1 influences
the development of NVG in CRVO patients."

Reducing the enormous burden of global infectious diseases remains one of the most important public health
problems in the world. This realization was brought to the attention of the world during the COVID-19
pandemic. Mathematical and Computational Predictive (MCP) modeling is essential for understanding the
epidemiology and mechanistic biology behind the spread of global infectious diseases. Modeling can play a
critical role, for example, in improving our understanding and prediction of antimicrobial resistance, in the
design of new antimicrobials and diagnostic tests, and in clarifying the complexities of the immune response
involved in vaccine-induced protection. To fully exploit the potential of MCP modeling in global infectious
disease research, however, we need to continue developing a common language and purpose that is still often
lacking between the biological and computational worlds. In Phase I of this TGIR COBRE, we made significant
progress in bridging this biomedical-computational “culture gap” through collaborative research and reciprocal
education about each group’s domain expertise. In Phase 2 of this TGIR COBRE program, the MCP Core will
continue to advance this mission by making its primary goal to serve the TGIR COBRE by bringing MCP
modeling to bear on global infectious diseases research at UVM and to support our developing research
project leaders (RPL) and junior faculty. At the same time, the MCP Core will continue its crucially important

RNA viruses are the cause of major current and future pandemics, with few antivirals and the potential to severely
strain global healthcare systems. In the past year, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-
CoV-2), a positive strand RNA virus that is the causative agent of COVID-19, has caused acute disruption on a
global scale. While the most recent influenza pandemic (2009) had a relatively low mortality rate, the emergence
of a novel influenza strain with higher mortality would place the global healthcare system under immense
pressure, and remains a constant threat. In the case of SARS-CoV-2 (and likely any future coronavirus or
influenza pandemic), an unparalleled demand for viral diagnostic testing resulted in global shortages of many of
the required reagents. RNA extraction in particular represents a choke point, not only due to shortages of the
required reagents, but also due to the cost of the extraction process, the labor, and time required to perform it.
While recent Emergency Use Authorizations have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for
commercial extraction-free diagnostic tests, these are proprietary systems; protocols that work with the open-
source RT-qPCR assay developed by the WHO are needed.
The goal of this study is to investigate factors that correlate with and/or influence viral infectivity of SARS-CoV-
2 and influenza, using clinical samples and classical virology techniques to examine what makes the particular
virus, or a particular patient, infectious.
An extension of a previously funded pilot project aimed at developing a streamlined SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic
test, we will expand our examination to include clinical influenza samples. Additionally, we will probe a number
of factors including sgRNA, negative strand RNA and SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads that considered together may be
able predict the presence of infectious virus, and potentially differentiate those individuals who are simply PCR-
positive from those who truly pose a risk of viral transmission. Since this work will generate a panel of clinical
isolates for both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza with a range of infectivities, we will also investigate a variety of
factors including RNA packaging, particle to PFU ratio, temperature stability, particle morphology and specific
genetic mutations, all of which may affect viral infectivity at the molecular level."

The mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 proved unexpectedly efficacious, but also require a series of
booster immunizations to remain protective. Global deployment of these vaccines has been slow, particularly in
low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), in part due to the logistical complications associated with multiple
vaccinations. We therefore propose a new RNA vaccine design: a single-dose self-amplifying mRNA vaccine
based on the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Our long-term goal is to develop of a novel vaccine modality that
consists of an RNA vaccine that feasibly delivers durable humoral and cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in a
single dose. Our novel design, named iDMV-1.0, utilizes RNA encoding the coronavirus replication machinery
in order to produce Spike mRNA within double membrane vesicles (DMV). iDMV-1.0, a 20 kB RNA derived
from the SARS-CoV-2 genome, consists of NSP1-16 of SARS CoV-2, mutations to stabilize the prefusion
conformation of Spike protein (19), ORF6-10, M protein, and N protein, GFP and Luciferase for detection, and
all non-coding 5’ and 3’ sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Because iDMV-1.0 permits self-amplification
of Spike mRNA, this lipid nanoparticles-encapsulated RNA vaccine exhibits increased protein expression in
tissue culture systems as compared to single round mRNA controls.
The objective of this grant is to assess iDMV-1.0 in preclinical studies in mice. In Aim 1, the humoral immune
response to the vaccine will be studied by assessing epitope choice of iDMV-1.0 as compared to mRNA-1273
(Moderna SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine) using deep mutational scanning and traditional serology. We will
assess durability of antigen expression and durability of humoral immune response for iDMV-1.0 as compared
to conventional mRNA vaccination in mice. In Aim 2, the cellular immune response will be compared between
both vaccine modalities to determine whether T cells specific to the SARS-CoV-2 proteome are generated by
iDMV-1.0. Together, these studies will provide the foundation to understand durability and specificity of a
potential single-shot SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine, providing a paradigm that may facilitate greater vaccine
uptake, particularly in LMIC settings."

The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified vaccine hesitancy as one of the top ten threats to global
health. Vaccine hesitancy has been associated with beliefs that may be seemingly unrelated to vaccines,
including both true conspiracy beliefs. When beliefs become part of the cultural norms of a group they are
known as cultural scaffold beliefs; some cultural scaffold beliefs are strongly intertwined with perceptions of
disease and vaccines. Nevertheless, most interventions developed to increase vaccine acceptance act on
perceptions of either the vaccine-preventable disease (e.g., cautioning about risks) or the vaccine itself (e.g.,
messages about vaccine safety) without considering the underlying scaffold beliefs. Perhaps not surprisingly,
the efficacy of such interventions has been disappointing. Our long-term goal is therefore to develop
interventions that act on cultural scaffold beliefs to reduce global vaccine hesitancy. Increasing the voluntary
vaccination rate could prevent up to 1.5 million deaths globally each year.
In Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro has endorsed and disseminated misinformation and false conspiracy
theories about COVID-19 and its vaccines. Furthermore, Brazil has one of the world’s most successful
childhood vaccination programs, making it an excellent case study to examine the relationship between
COVID-19 misinformation cultural scaffold beliefs and adoption of vaccine-hesitant beliefs related to childhood
vaccination.
We will use social media data from Brazil to address our overarching hypothesis that vaccine hesitancy within
a community is strongly influenced by prevailing cultural scaffold beliefs in the following three aims:
Aim 1: Determine the association between COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs and childhood vaccine hesitancy.
Aim 2: Determine how receipt of anti-vaccine versus pro-vaccine information influences decision making in
vaccine-uncertain parents.
Aim 3: Develop an agent-based modeling tool for studying the joint dynamics of cultural scaffold and vaccine
hesitancy beliefs."

A growth in the aging population together with improved stroke care has resulted in an increase in survivors and
a rise in recurrent ischemic events, presenting major challenges for overburdened healthcare economics for
these patients. Consequently, approaches to induce tolerance in the brain against ischemia have gained new
momentum in clinical and experimental studies. However, mechanisms of ischemic preconditioning (IPC) have
been primarily studied in gray matter (GM), despite white matter (WM) injury and axon dysfunction being critical
components of clinical deficits observed in stroke patients. Moreover, most in vivo models of IPC performed in
rodents consist of short episodes of hypoxia/ischemia and are not applicable to translate into clinical settings as
therapeutics. Therefore, there is an unmet need to establish clinically applicable pharmacological approaches to
preconditioning the brain against ischemia. Our preliminary results show that CX-4945 (Silmitasertib), an FDA-
approved Casein Kinase 2 (CK2) inhibitor, preconditions WM, promotes axon function recovery and improves
behavioral outcomes after an in vitro or in vivo ischemic injury. Although aging reduces neuronal IPC, CX-4945
comparably preconditions young and aging WM by preserving mitochondrial motility. Because the threshold to
precondition is reported to be higher in females, the main goal of this current proposal is to understand the
mechanisms of preconditioning conferred by CK2 inhibition in young and aging male and female WM.
We have reported that CK2 signals via the CDK5 and AKT pathways to mediate ischemic WM injury. Thus, CK2
inhibition correlates with the preservation of oligodendrocytes, axon structure and function, and conservation of
mitochondrial dynamics in young and aging WM. Our preliminary data show that a brief period of CK2 inhibition
with CX-4945 effectively preconditions axon function by maintaining mitochondrial motility. Furthermore,
preconditioning with CX-4945 considerably attenuates behavioral deficits observed after an in vivo focal
subcortical WM injury. We identified miR-501 as an ischemia-upregulated miRNA that is suppressed by CK2
inhibition, and reciprocal interaction between levels of miR-501 and Miro-2 regulates axonal mitochondrial
motility. A similar upregulation of miR-501 levels in stroke patient plasma samples compared to age- and sex-
matched controls propose CK2 as a clinically relevant therapeutic target. Therefore, we propose to extend these
studies by testing our novel hypothesis that CK2 inhibition preconditions WM by differentially regulating the CDK5
and AKT signaling pathways to maintain mitochondrial dynamics by reciprocally regulating miR-501 and Miro-2
levels. We will combine electrophysiology, advanced imaging, functional analysis of mitochondria, mouse miRNA
expression and regulation studies, human miRNA expression in plasma and human brain studies, and validation
of regulated signaling molecules to determine whether CK2 inhibition acts via CDK5 or AKT to regulate
mitochondrial proteins through alteration of miRNA profiles to precondition WM against ischemia."

Spaced training is known to be more efficacious in producing long-term memories than training with short inter-
trial intervals (massed training). Attempts to optimize the spacing effect generally are based on trial-and-error
approaches for choosing the optimal intervals. Consequently, most, if not all, training protocols used in animal
and human studies are probably not optimal. We believe that the explanation for why one protocol is more
effective than another lies, at least in part, in the dynamic interactions of key signaling molecules involved in the
induction of long-term synaptic plasticity. The present proposal will investigate the dynamics of signaling
cascades critical for the efficacy of training protocols that lead to induction of long-term memory (LTM), using
long-term synaptic facilitation (LTF) at sensorimotor synapses as a model system.. An understanding of these
interactions would provide insights into mechanisms for LTM induction and consolidation in other systems. The
present proposal will analyze the dynamics of key protein kinases such as protein kinase A (PKA), extracellular
signal–regulated kinase (ERK), ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38
MAPK); and key transcription factors such as cAMP-response element binding protein 1 (CREB1) and its
repressor CREB2, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), and methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) for
periods up to 48 hours after different training protocols (Aim 1). In Aim 2, the quantitative contribution of these
processes to LTF will be assessed using pharmacological and RNAi techniques. Aim 1 will provide a detailed
description of how kinases and transcription factors are regulated by different LTF-inducing protocols for up to
48 h after treatment. Aim 2 will characterize the necessity of critical signaling molecules to the induction,
consolidation, and maintenance of LTF. By comparing the commonality and differences among the time courses
of kinases and transcription factors activated by different protocols, we will identify key components for induction,
consolidation, and persistence of LTF. These data will be used to predict improved single-block and multi-block
training protocols for enhancing/prolonging LTF and LTM (Aim 3)."

Pancreatic cancer is a deadly human malignancy, with a five-year survival rate of 11%. Further, the incidence of
pancreatic cancer is rising and is projected to be the second-leading cause of cancer-related death in the United
States by 2030. The increasing occurrence of this disease, combined with the lack of effective treatments,
creates an urgent need to better understand the factors that contribute to the progression of pancreatic cancer,
and to develop improved therapies that will tangibly benefit human health. One pathway that has been implicated
in pancreatic cancer for nearly twenty years is the Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway. Initial work demonstrated
that HH ligand expression increases during pancreatic cancer progression, while more recent studies have found
that tumor-derived HH ligands signal in a paracrine fashion to activate HH signaling in pancreatic fibroblasts. As
with many efforts to treat pancreatic cancer, clinical trials with HH pathway inhibitors have proven ineffective, or
actually sped disease progression. However, work from our laboratories has identified three novel findings
regarding the role of HH signaling in pancreatic cancer progression: First, we have found that the levels of HH
signaling can determine whether HH signaling promotes or inhibits pancreatic tumor growth; Second, we have
recently discovered that HH pathway inhibition can alter the fibroblast composition in the pancreatic cancer
microenvironment; Third, our data indicate that HH pathway inhibition dramatically alters immune composition,
through altered fibroblast-immune crosstalk. Together, these data suggest that an improved understanding of
the role of HH signaling in the pancreatic cancer microenvironment, including HH-dependent fibroblast-immune
crosstalk will provide an opportunity to advance the development of more effective pancreatic cancer treatment
options. In this proposal, we will investigate the role of glioma-associated proteins (GLIs), a family of three
proteins (GLI1-3) that are the transcriptional effectors of the HH signaling pathway, in pancreatic cancer
progression. Specifically, we will use novel pancreatic fibroblast cell lines lacking Gli1, Gli2 or Gli3 individually
and in combination to investigate the consequences on pancreatic tumor growth in co-transplantation assays.
We will also investigate Gli deletion in vivo using two different Cre driver alleles (PdgfraCreER and Gli1CreER)
in a novel, FlpO-driven mouse model of pancreatic cancer progression. Further, we will investigate GLI-
dependent effects on fibroblast-immune crosstalk through assessment of macrophage and T cell migration,
polarization and function. Finally, we will define GLI transcriptional targets in pancreatic fibroblasts both in vitro
and in vivo, in the normal pancreas and in the context of pancreatic cancer, using a novel set of epitope-tagged
knock-in alleles. This work will advance our understanding of the role of HH/GLI signaling in pancreatic cancer."

The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Maternal-
Fetal Medicine Units (MFMU) Network was created in 1986 to conduct clinical research studies in obstetrics
and perinatal medicine. The MFMU Network, consisting of a number of major academic clinical centers, a data
coordinating center (DCC), and the NICHD, will serve as the first-line infrastructure for implementing multi-site
obstetric clinical trials and observational studies. Research studies conducted within the MFMU Network will be
aimed at reducing maternal morbidity and mortality related to pregnancy, reducing fetal and infant morbidity
and mortality related to preterm birth and fetal growth abnormalities, and expanding the evidence on
therapeutic products used during pregnancy and lactation. To fulfill this mission, the MFMU Network plans to
conduct 5-10 new studies. The MFMU Network structure allows studies to be completed in a more rigorous
and reproducible fashion and more efficiently than individual multi-center projects.
The overall purpose of the DCC is to make sure that the studies are designed to minimize bias, are conducted
using rigorous protocols and procedures, and the results analyzed and interpreted appropriately to ensure the
validity of the conclusions. The aims of the DCC are to provide scientific and biostatistical expertise through
collaborations with Network and non-Network investigators on study design, conduct, analysis and reporting of
clinical studies. The DCC will conduct safety and interim analyses for the Data and Safety Monitoring Board,
collaborate with investigators on statistical analyses and the dissemination of study results, and share datasets
and resources. The DCC will provide a flexible data management system and collaborate with investigators on
the conduct and monitoring of each study including creation of study documents, training, and reporting to the
Steering Committee, NIH, other committees and/or working groups, as well as the Food and Drug
Administration for any studies under an IND/IDE. Lastly, the DCC will coordinate communication through both
private and public websites, and provide the logistical and administrative support to the overall Network
organization necessary to run efficient and productive studies. Through effective organization, communication,
and logistical, technical and scientific support, the DCC will continue to provide the framework for the MFMU
Network to address the key scientific questions in obstetrics, obstetric pharmacology, and lactation clinical
practice."

This application proposes to lay the groundwork for precision medicine approaches to autism spectrum disorder
(ASD) by identifying reproducible clinically relevant brain-connectome-based subtypes. The proposal addresses
the clinical and biological heterogeneity of ASD by focusing on the intermediate level of analysis of systems
neuroscience, following clues that ASD is associated with abnormalities in the brain functional connectome.
Thus, we aim to identify neurosubtypes (NS), i.e., subgroups of individuals with homogeneous atypical features,
based on measures of intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC). Primary aims are to: 1) generate a large,
retrospectively harmonized data resource with comprehensive assessment of iFC and clinical phenotypes; 2)
identify iFC-based neurosubtypes and establish their associations with clinically relevant phenotypes; 3) test the
replicability of neurosubtypes and their associations with phenotypic measures in an independent sample . To
this end, we propose to leverage existing large-scale ASD neuroimaging data collections from the Autism Brain
Imaging Data Exchange, the National Database for Autism Research, and the Healthy Brain Network. Sample:
Age/Sex: Boys and girls, 6-18 years old. Diagnosis: ASD and neurotypical (NT) individuals. Size: to date, the
above neuroimaging resources contain a total N=3528; ASD n=2136, NT n=1392. Methods: Following
systematic and extensive data organization, rigorous quality assurance, and preprocessing we will proceed with
quantitative data harmonization using state-of-the-art methods. CovBat, the most advanced version of the
Bayesian framework, ComBat, will be applied to harmonize MRI data. It has been developed by Co-I Shinohara
to control for inter-scanner differences in MRI-based measures, as well as for errors arising from subject
differences in measurement covariance. Recent advances in item response theory will be used to harmonize
phenotypic data, informed by preliminary clinical work. To further enhance our clinical data harmonization efforts,
the neuroimaging data will be aggregated with phenotypic-only collections from Co-Is Lord and Bishop (ASD
n=1513). Connectopathy features: To scope the entire spectrum of ASD connectopathy, multiple features will be
assessed simultaneously for the first time. Neurosubtypes: Building on our feasibility work with Co-I Yeo,
homogeneous neural ASD subgroups will be identified through novel Bayesian latent factor modeling. It allows
for subjects to belong to subtypes in varying degrees, identifying hybrid, categorical and dimensional,
neurosubtypes. Other key questions include the relevance of MRI features studied, the diagnostic specificity of
neurosubtypes, and cross-subtyping method validity. The neurosubtypes identified and methods for
harmonization, along with all data generated for mega-analyses will be regularly shared, starting at the end of
year two. Findings will address critical knowledge gaps and the novel resource will offer the scientific community
opportunities to pursue independent inquiries transforming biological research and knowledge of ASD."

Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular apicomplexan parasite causing severe opportunistic infections.
Current drugs are prone to induce hypersensitivity, especially upon long-term use. Infection comprises a short,
acute stage (tachyzoite) followed by a dormant stage (bradyzoites in tissue cysts) for the life of the host.
However, an impaired or suppressed immune response (e.g., AIDS, organ transplant, cancer treatment) can
lead to reactivation of a dormant infection that was acquired years ago, leading to clinical toxoplasmosis.
Interference with the tachyzoite-bradyzoite interconversion is an attractive target for novel therapeutic strategies.
A key factor in stage interconversion is the ability to respond to stress: the immune response ‘stress’ maintains
the bradyzoite stage, but if it wanes, the parasite defaults back to the acute stage. Reprogramming toward the
bradyzoite is facilitated by the competitive interplay of about 10 transcription factors (TFs) balancing sequential,
cooperative, and opposing roles. The research team recently discovered that the TF set associated with
bradyzoite differentiation overlaps by 2/3 with the TFs expressed in parasites exposed to the extracellular (e.c.)
environment. This provided the first glimpse of how the stress response is integrated into the transcriptional
program leading to the bradyzoite. Indeed, the transcriptome of e.c. and bradyzoite parasites shares many
genes, which positions the extracellular stage in between tachyzoites and bradyzoites. Here, the stress-related
transcriptional program will be further dissected by extending on this observation with innovative CUT&RUN,
single cell expression profiling (scRNA-seq), and the application of a novel in vitro generated myotube bradyzoite
differentiation system. Excitingly, this myotube system demonstrated that spontaneous bradyzoite differentiation
occurs in this cell type, but to reach and maintain a mature bradyzoite state, an exogenous, alkaline stress needs
to be applied. Hence, this provides the perfect platform to dissect the contribution of stress-related transcriptional
regulation to bradyzoite maturation. In short, the transcriptional network of stress will be dissected by 1.
identifying the genes controlled by the 4-6 TFs shared between e.c. stress and bradyzoite conversion through
CUT&RUN experiments; 2. scRNA-seq of mixed cell populations representing the transcriptional transitions of
extracellular stress over the span of 6 hrs, and myotube-induced bradyzoite differentiation with and without
alkaline stress. An advanced computational pipeline will be established to model the transitional programs that
will permit answers to several open questions, such as: is there indeed a two-step bradyzoite differentiation
pathway, and what are the genes driving these?; is the myotube seen as a stress by the parasites or not?; is
there a specific stage in the cell cycle when bradyzoite differentiation occurs (a G2-like cell cycle stage and the
late G1 restriction-checkpoint have been proposed)? In addition, comparative mapping of stress responses
under different conditions will provide insights in how stress is integrated at the distinct parasite stages to
modulate the stage-specific transcriptional responses."

Lupus or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a potentially fatal autoimmune disease with a substantial
genetic basis. SLE is characterized by abnormal T- and B-cell responses, production of numerous pathogenic
autoantibodies, and immune complex deposition, leading to various clinical manifestations including multi-organ
damage (e.g., kidneys, skin). SLE has disproportionate impacts based on gender and ethnicity. Approximately
90% of those affected are women. In addition, SLE has a 3-5-fold higher prevalence in Asian, African-American,
and Hispanic individuals compared to those with European ancestry, as well as more severe clinical manifesta-
tions, including organ damage (e.g., nephritis). Evidence from genetics, cell biology, and animal models suggests
that autophagy, a major pathway for organelle and protein turnover, plays a pivotal role in SLE pathogenesis.
Autophagy is a highly conserved lysosome-mediated catabolic process that removes unwanted cytoplasmic
components (e.g., long-lived and/or misfolded proteins) and damaged organelles. This process maintains cellular
homeostasis and survival under metabolic stress. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked
autoimmune diseases, including SLE, to autophagy-related genes. However, there is currently a huge gap in
defining causal relationships between associated variants and molecular mechanisms underlying SLE. This lack
of knowledge about pathogenic effects underlying GWAS signals hinders translating GWAS discoveries into
diagnosis and treatment. To address this issue, we selected six highly ranked, well-replicated loci; four of them
were initially discovered in Asian populations, two we previously reported as novel loci for SLE susceptibility. We
have assembled a research team with the expertise and resources to discover and mechanistically characterize
functional variants linked to SLE. We hypothesize that at each GWAS locus, both common and rare variants
contribute to SLE risk by affecting expression of autophagy genes through tissue-specific regulatory elements.
Aim 1 will identify SLE-predisposing variants using a comprehensive imputation-based analysis of combined
novel resequencing data from SLE patients and controls in addition to our previous fine-mapping of four ethnically
diverse populations. Functional variants will be prioritized by allele-specific expression, open chromatin, and 3D
interaction data from immune cells. We will elucidate genetic and clinical heterogeneity of SLE by assessing
association of identified variants with SLE and its clinical manifestations and autoantibody profiles. Associated
variants, especially imputed and rare variants, will be validated through follow-up genotyping. Aim 2 will define
the mechanistic and functional consequences of SLE-predisposing variants using appropriate functional assays,
including CRISPR-based gene knock-out and base-editing in cell lines (Jurkat, Toledo, podocyte, HEK293) and
primary immune cells (T- and B-cells) relevant to SLE. Thus, we will uncover functional variants underlying SLE
association signals, and illuminate mechanisms by which these variants contribute to lupus and its clinical
manifestations. Through this approach, our analysis should yield novel targets for potential clinical interventions."

Malaria continues to result in more than 400,000 deaths annually, mainly in young African children. Effective
immunity to malaria develops in endemic populations, but only after many repeated infections. Intermittent
preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) and childhood (IPTc) have emerged as strategies to decrease
childhood morbidity and mortality, but there is concern that preventing malaria exposure early in life will delay
the development of antimalarial immunity. However, data from our group suggests that interventions that
selectively block the blood stage of malaria infection during this critical time may actually enhance antimalarial
immunity. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that preventing blood-stage malaria antigenic exposure
in utero and in young children with IPT enhances protective immunity to malaria by limiting malaria-induced
immunoregulatory mechanisms. To test this hypothesis, we will take advantage of a unique opportunity to
study children born to mothers enrolled in a funded clinical trial of different IPTp regimens in an area of eastern
Uganda with very high malaria transmission intensity. In this parent study, 2757 pregnant women will be
randomized to receive IPTp with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP, the poorly effective, current standard of
care), the highly effective drug dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP), or both SP+DP. We will leverage this
parent study to enroll a birth cohort of 924 children who will be randomized at birth to receive no IPTc, IPTc
with monthly DP to 1 year of age, or IPTc with monthly DP to 2 years of age. Children will be followed up to 4
years of age. This unique study design will allow us to determine whether effective prevention of blood-stage
malaria exposure with DP-based IPT both in pregnancy and in infancy has lasting benefits for young children
compared with the current standard of care. Our specific aims will be (1) to compare the incidence of malaria
from birth up to 4 years of age among children born to mothers randomized to receive monthly IPTp with SP,
DP, or DP+SP, (2) To compare the incidence of malaria from 2 up to 4 years of age among children
randomized to receive no IPTc in infancy, monthly DP for the first year of life, or monthly DP for the first two
years of life, and (3) To determine whether prevention of malaria with effective IPT leads to lower regulatory
responses and enhanced innate and adaptive immune responses. By determining whether effective prevention
of malaria with IPT during pregnancy and infancy leads to long-term, lasting benefits on infant health, this study
could critically inform policy guidelines, including extending the use of IPT to settings where malaria
transmission is year-round. These studies will also significantly improve our understanding of how preventing
malaria early in life affects infant immune development and the acquisition of antimalarial immunity."

A hallmark of living organisms is their ability to adapt to the world around them. Such
adaptation takes place across many different scales in both space and time. On cellular
time scales, molecules in individual cells enable them to regulate metabolic genes and
thrive despite changing carbon sources. Over generations, cells evolve and adapt to
stresses such as antibiotics. In the work proposed here, we will uncover principles of
such adaptation over the functional hierarchy from molecules to cells to populations. To
achieve this goal, our laboratory will use our tradition of integrating precise
measurements with biophysical theory on specifically constructed biological systems.
Our first research thrust is built on the recognition that despite the amazing successes
of molecular biology and genome science over the last half century, we still know next
to nothing about how genes are regulated for more than 65% of the genes in the
commensal gut bacterium E. coli, which is arguably biology's best-understood
organism. With this award we will create a first draft of the regulatory genome for the
entire E. coli genome - including the binding energies and identities of every
transcription factor and the genes or operons that they regulate. A second thrust
focuses on a key way that living organisms respond to intracellular and environmental
signals: through conformational changes in individual allosteric proteins and in
assemblies of proteins, such as those found in the spindle responsible for chromosome
segregation. Using a system we developed to finely control cytoskeleton-motor
interactions using light, we seek to discover a predictive theoretical framework that
guides and constrains how we view assembly and adaptation. The third thrust in our
study of adaptation will build upon the previous two threads by providing a rigorous
examination of how genomes and the proteins that interact with them evolve. The
specific case studies will focus on the evolution of transcriptional regulation with special
emphasis on the response of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotic drugs. The cell is the
fundamental organizational unit of living organisms and the work proposed here will
provide a far-reaching but detailed view of how cells adapt. The approach we adopt is
ultimately biophysical; we insist that our analysis of the cell be at once quantitative and
predictive, sharpening our questions and deepening our understanding in a way that
can ultimately be parlayed into new strategies for improving human health."

Although there have been important advances in the detection and treatment of cancer, there remains an
urgent need to develop new therapeutic strategies. Copper (Cu) is an essential micronutrient that is required in
higher amounts by cancer cells relative to normal tissues. Several enzymes with key roles in cancer require
Cu for their activity, including lysyl oxidases and several oncogenic kinases (e.g., MEK1; ULK1). In pre-clinical
models of cancer, many studies have shown that tumor growth and metastasis is suppressed by Cu chelators
added to the diet. In clinical trials, Cu depletion via an oral Cu chelator was found to significantly slow disease
progression in patients with mesothelioma, and significantly extend survival in breast cancer patients. While it
is clear that Cu depletion is a promising anticancer strategy, there is a need to develop therapies that
specifically target pathways of Cu delivery to oncogenic enzymes. In the current proposal, we pursue a highly
innovative approach by targeting the Cu transporter, ATP7A.
Our extensive preliminary studies validate ATP7A as a therapeutic target including: 1) Intestine-specific
deletion of murine ATP7A lowers systemic copper status to levels shown to be therapeutic in cancer patients;
2) ATP7A is required to deliver copper to the family of lysyl oxidases, which have well-documented roles in
metastasis; 3) Targeted deletion of ATP7A in breast and lung cancer cell lines reduces primary tumor growth
and metastasis in mice; 4) Elevated ATP7A expression is significantly correlated with lower survival in cancer
patients. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that a small molecule inhibitor of ATP7A will be
therapeutic in cancer. Using computer-aided drug design, we have identified a hit molecule called MKV3 that
binds to ATP7A with nanomolar affinity and inhibits ATP7A activity in cancer cell lines. Mice treated with MKV3
showed reduced activity of the serum Cu biomarker, ceruloplasmin, and reduced tumor growth. In this
proposal, we will conduct structure guided optimization to identify MKV3 analogs with improved potency and
drug like properties (Aim 1); conduct pharmacokinetic studies to identify MKV3 analogs that are suitable for
pharmacodynamic studies (Aim 2); and evaluate the most favorable MKV3 analog in mouse models of breast
cancer (Aim 3)."

10919864,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This Biospecimens, Pathology, and Clinical Database Core will not only furnish essential services for the
individual projects by managing patient data, safety, and samples, but it will provide a link between clinical data
and research outcomes and interface with the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core to allow for formal
interactions between existing datasets to develop relational networks. It will accomplish its goals by integrating
with and building upon existing, successful infrastructure housed at the Mayo Clinic, making the Core an
efficient, integral component of this SPORE.
The significant patient referral base and clinical practice at the Mayo Clinic (>10,000 patient visits annually with
multiple myeloma and related conditions) will allow substantial patient recruitment to the clinical trials and
translational studies in this Mayo SPORE in multiple myeloma. The already extant 12,000+ bone marrow
samples in our Biospecimens Core make SPORE and DRP projects possible. The on-going initiative of
collecting data and research specimens from additional myeloma patients will feed into all SPORE projects and
make Development Research and Career Development Award Programs possible. The Aims of the Core are:
 1. to provide support for collection, transport, processing and storage of samples;
 2. to supply the data system infrastructure to track all SPORE patients and samples;
 3. to provide coordination and oversight of distribution of samples to SPORE investigators; and
 4. to serve as a resource of expertise, collaborative support and service for full projects as well as Career
 Enhancement and Developmental Research Awardee research.
This Core provides a mechanism of consistent and compatible data handling, thereby facilitating management
of collected data and integration with data from existing Mayo resources. Areas of data support include
database development, data form development and processing, quality control, data collection and entry, and
data archiving. This Core is unique not only in its scope and potential, but also in that it will be built on existing
(but currently unfunded) tissue banking facilities and processes at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester and in Arizona,
guaranteeing successful performance. Finally, the Core will interface with the clinical research components of
other SPORE grantees and cancer centers to facilitate multi-institutional clinical research arising out of national
myeloma research efforts."

Since 2008, the UT Health Science Center at San Antonio’s CTSA KL2 Mentored Career
Development Program has had an exemplary track record of training and mentoring junior faculty. Our program
has been recognized nationally for the diversity of its Scholars, with 55% women and 33% under-represented
persons. It is also recognized for forming and co-leading a national KL2 PI/Directors Consortium Group, which
meets regularly to network, share best practices, and develop innovative programs, such as the Virtual CTSA
Visiting Scholars Program, in which KL2 Scholars throughout the CTSA Consortium can visit other CTSA hubs
to network with experts in their field and to deliver a nationally streamed CTSA Grand Rounds. Our KL2 program
has provided 2 years of support for our Scholars, with a required third year of support funded by the Scholar’s
home department. To date, our KL2 program, like others in the CTSA Consortium, has focused on translational
research – the endeavor to traverse a particular step of the translational process for a particular target or disease.
Yet, historically, the process of translation has been notoriously slow. For the new K12 program, we have the
opportunity to add a focus on translational science, the field of investigation focused on understanding the
scientific and operational principles underlying each step of the translational process in order to catalyze
translation. As such, we will incorporate new training in translational science based on competencies we
published for a translational researcher vs. a translational scientist; diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility;
dissemination and implementation; and leadership. The curriculum will be co-developed with the University of
Utah CTSA and targeted to K12 Scholars from both CTSA hubs, T32 Trainees, and other members of the
translational science workforce; once developed, the curriculum will be shared with the CTSA Consortium. We
will continue our rigorous and inclusive Scholar selection process. For their research projects, each K12 Scholar
will incorporate a component of translational science. Scholars will be mentored by a team of mentors, including
a clinician; the primary mentors will undergo evidence-based mentor training, with an emphasis on mentoring
under-represented Scholars. With the formalization of our partnerships with UT Austin, UT San Antonio, and
Texas Biomedical Research Institute, we will increase the number of CTSA-funded Scholars from the current 4
at a time to 5 at a time, plus 3 institutionally funded Scholars. We will diversify the leadership of the K12 by
adding a female multi-PI from UT Austin and by mentoring an under-represented former Scholar to become a
K12 program leader. To continue the highly successful Virtual CTSA Visiting Scholar Program once support by
the national CTSA coordinating center sunsets, we, with K12/KL2 programs at Harvard, the University of North
Carolina, and Stanford, will assume management of the program, create innovative features, and evaluate
program and Scholar experiences. Together, these K12 program features promise to yield investigators who will
become leaders in translational research and the science of translation."

For the past 15 years, the Clinical and Translational Science Collaborative (CTSC) at Case Western Reserve
University (CWRU) has linked clinical and translational research efforts at five independent institutions—
CWRU, Cleveland Clinic, MetroHealth System, University Hospitals of Cleveland, and Louis Stokes Cleveland
Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Two new partners (University of Toledo School of Medicine and Northeast
Ohio Medical University) are now being added to extend the CTSC’s reach across Northern Ohio. The CWRU
CTSC has a strong track record of enhancing the quantity and quality of Clinical and Translational Science
(CTS) among our partners by facilitating novel research paradigms, technologies, and training. Our CTSC has
developed a new generation of researchers, enhanced collaborations among investigators, streamlined
discovery by building partnerships among industry and community and organizational partners, and facilitated
many successful entrepreneurial startups. Building on this solid foundation, the CWRU CTSC proposes an
expanded focus on health equity, reflected in the project theme Catalyzing Linkages to Equity in Health (CLE
Health). Social, economic, and environmental disadvantages are linked to poor health outcomes and lead to
disparities in life expectancy, infant mortality, and rates of chronic conditions. Minority groups are often
underrepresented in clinical trials as well, meaning there can be insufficient data for understanding the
effectiveness or safety of new drugs, procedures, or health interventions for different populations. The overall
goals of this project are to 1) understand the fundamental barriers to optimal recruitment of underrepresented
groups in clinical trials and test and scale interventions aimed at breaking down these barriers to diversify
study engagement, 2) facilitate and expedite innovation in multicenter clinical and translational research by
fully integrating community and stakeholder partners and ensuring that this research represents the
experiences of all and results in health improvements for all, 3) disseminate and implement novel and
responsive research programs across clinical and community settings to advance access to health
interventions that aim to promote health equity, and 4) create and disseminate inclusive and high impact
educational and training programs for translational research professionals of all disciplines and levels, both in
clinical and community settings. The CTSC has designed a Strategic Management Core and six CTS research
and training Elements to accomplish these goals: Workforce Development, Community & Stakeholder
Engagement, Resources & Services, CTS Pilot, Health Informatics, and CTS Research Program. We are
committed to innovative and collaborative practice and dissemination of results so that everyone in Northern
Ohio—and beyond—can benefit from advances in CTS in our programs and discoveries."
10932883,"My lab will use machine learning to build physically-grounded models of biomolecules and their interactions and
apply these models at proteome (genome) scale to address basic questions in the systems biology of human
signaling. On the modeling front, our efforts will focus on building computational models of protein-ligand
interactions, with a specific emphasis on post-translationally modified ligands that cells widely employ in signaling
networks. I hypothesize that a step change in accuracy and generality of protein-ligand interaction models is
possible using deep learning advances in protein structure prediction and protein representation learning. My
lab has been at the forefront of these advances, having developed the first end-to-end differentiable model of
protein structure prediction (RGN); the first protein language model (UniRep), a key technique for learning
mathematical representations that capture chemical, structural, and evolutionary properties of proteins; and one
of the first deep learning methods for protein-protein interactions (HSM). We will leverage our expertise in these
domains to predict protein-ligand interactions based on both sequence and structure information. We will further
develop specialized models for predicting protein structures and alternate protein conformations for the purpose
of predicting protein-ligand interaction, using these predictions as inputs for our protein-ligand interaction models.
On the biological front, we will employ these machine-learned models to assemble person-specific signaling
networks to understand how normal allelic variation is manifested at the level of signaling networks, and how
these networks are perturbed in human diseases. To study general variation in signaling networks, we will use
exome sequences (UK Biobank and NHLBI TOPMed) to build individualized networks that map person-specific
protein sequences to protein-ligand affinities. We will quantify how network topology varies among individuals
and populations and test whether disease-associated traits correlate with topology. We will also compare
networks of healthy and disease-afflicted persons to identify topological differences that predispose individuals
to genetic diseases. Ultimately, I expect machine-learned models to be sufficiently predictive of ligand binding
that mechanistic understanding of pathway rewiring by mutations is possible. While my focus will be
computational, I expect to carry out close collaborations—with the Fordyce Lab (Stanford) to experimentally
characterize and validate protein-ligand interactions and the Shen Lab (Columbia) to perform statistical genetic
analyses—to exploit synergies at the interface of computation and experimentation."

 Lipids are important cellular macromolecules that form membranes, are a major form of energy storage, play
crucial roles in cell signaling, and are frequently dysregulated in disease. Cells obtain lipids in two main ways:
either through uptake from exogenous sources or else via synthesis from acetyl-CoA in the cytoplasm by Fatty
Acid Synthase (FASN). However, cells have evolutionarily maintained a second, completely distinct fatty acid
synthesis pathway in the mitochondria (mtFAS).
 Mitochondria are well known as the “powerhouse of the cell.” In direct contrast to this well-known function,
the mtFAS pathway uses acetyl-CoA to build fatty acids instead of breaking them down. Why mitochondria
harbor a pathway that builds fatty acids, especially given that mitochondria take up lipids from other
areas of the cell, is incompletely understood. In fact, mtFAS is so understudied that the genes encoding
several steps in the pathway are still unannotated. The major goal of my research group is to define the basic
biology of the mtFAS pathway.
 I previously defined a mechanism whereby mtFAS coordinates three major functions of the mitochondria: the
TCA cycle, electron transport chain assembly, and iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis. We hypothesize that this
coordinating function of mtFAS provides cells with a means to monitor mitochondrial acetyl-CoA – the substrate
of the pathway – and to adjust mitochondrial metabolism accordingly. The mechanisms that regulate this nutrient
sensing function and mtFAS activity in general are undescribed. The studies planned in this proposal will address
crucial gaps in our understanding of how genes and metabolites control mtFAS pathway activity. We will also
explore cell-type specificity of mtFAS pathway action, and the role of mtFAS in cellular differentiation signaling
and cell fate decisions. Defining how mtFAS regulates mitochondrial function in response to changes in
metabolite availability will rewrite the field’s working model of how mitochondria sense nutrients and
adapt to changing nutritional environments.
 I am well suited to achieve these goals due to my expertise in mtFAS pathway function and my prior research
experience in mitochondrial biology, which lies at the intersection of bioenergetics, cell signaling, and metabolic
regulation. Successful completion of these studies will place me and my trainees at the forefront of the field of
mitochondrial metabolism, and well-position my laboratory for long-term success."
10903962,"Project Summary
The long-term goal of our research program is to understand and identify the mechanisms of cell shape
dynamics that facilitate the emergence of tissue-wide patterns from local cell-cell communication events. The
incorrect spatial and temporal induction of genes and cell behaviors by perturbed signaling can lead to
catastrophic errors in development. Therefore, it is critical to understand how signaling mechanisms that take
place at the level of a cell or adjacent cells are coordinated across larger tissue length scales to achieve robust
patterns and support tissue homeostasis. Cytonemes, or signaling filopodia, are long actin-rich cellular
protrusions that allow cells to physically interact with, and signal to, other cells at a distance. Cellular
protrusions like cytonemes have been shown to play a role in many developmental processes, including spot
and stripe patterning, limb patterning, stem cell niche maintenance, and neural plate patterning. Despite this,
relatively little is known about the general mechanisms that regulate cytoneme-specific formation and behavior.
We are interested in understanding how these protrusions are regulated both at the level of cytoskeletal
mechanisms, and as an integrated part of the cell-wide and tissue-wide signaling states. To address this
problem, we use the spot pattern of bristles on the dorsal thorax of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a
model system. During bristle patterning, cytonemes extend from the basal surface of thoracic epithelial cells to
facilitate long-range, Notch-mediated, lateral inhibition. Leveraging our strengths in Drosophila model systems
genetics and quantitative live microscopy, over the next five years our goals include understanding how the
formation of cytonemes are regulated, especially downstream of Notch-mediated lateral inhibition signaling. In
parallel, we aim to understand how cytoneme activity contributes to cell and tissue heterogeneities that
facilitate the timely formation of well-organized patterns. These studies will not only yield valuable cell
biological knowledge about the specific regulation of cytonemes, but will also elucidate fundamental
mechanisms that coordinate patterning across length scales."
10886021,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Eukaryotic trans-Golgi network (TGN) has been extensively studied for its role as the major sorting
compartment and the center for terminal processing and modifications of newly synthesized proteins. While the
TGN is known for its dynamic nature associated with the constant flux of traffic, whether its structures can be
altered in microbe-eukaryote interactions and the subsequent consequences have remained elusive until
recently. Our previous study has discovered that multiple microbial factors (e.g., bacterial antibiotics nigericin
and gramicidin) are able to induce the disassembly of the TGN into vesicles. These dispersed TGN vesicles
then serve as a signaling platform for the assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. NLRP3
pathway induces proinflammatory cytokines, and its hyperactivation has been closely associated with a wide
variety of human diseases, including autoimmune diseases, cancers, neurodegeneration, and metabolic
disorders. Importantly, these stimuli do not affect the closely associated cis- and medial-Golgi, indicating that it
is a tightly regulated reorganization event specifically targeting the TGN. Dissection of the detailed cellular and
molecular basis has been challenging because these stimuli are either small molecules or nonribosomal
peptides not encoded by genes. Recently, we have discovered two groups of microbial factors, i.e., pore-
forming toxins from bacteria and viroporins from viruses, as highly specific TGN-dispersing stimuli. The protein
nature of these stimuli has allowed us to easily track their translocation and genetically manipulate them to
study the effects on TGN remodeling. In addition, we found evidence that TGN remodeling is not only
important for inflammatory signaling, but also results in altered glycosylations. The ultimate goal of this MIRA
R35 proposal is to use these protein microbial factors as tools to study the detailed mechanisms and functions
of TGN remodeling. We will pursue three major questions: (1) What are the regions/motifs that are critical for
these stimuli to remodel the TGN? Our identification of novel TGN dispersion peptide motifs will greatly
facilitate future screening and identification of other TGN dispersion ligands in both microbes and eukaryotic
organisms. (2) What eukaryotic factors (e.g., TGN-localized GTPases and golgin family proteins) are involved
in TGN remodeling, and how conserved are their functions in other eukaryotic species such as yeast? (3) How
does TGN remodeling affect various eukaryotic cellular processes, including inflammatory signaling and
proteins modifications? Our proposed studies will help fill a critical knowledge gap on the mechanisms and
functions of TGN remodeling, as well as providing invaluable insights into the rational design of innovative
therapeutics to mitigate a wide range of human health problems."

10891551,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chromosomes are a fundamental structure necessary for the faithful transmission of genetic
information. At the center of chromosome formation and segregation are centromeres, whose
underlying DNA sequence often make up a surprisingly large portion of a genome. Often
composed of repetitive satellite sequences, they are found to evolve and change quickly across
species, likely due to selfish behavior. Along with centromeric changes in sequence and position,
one of the most dramatic genomic changes that can occur is when a chromosome becomes
involved in sex determination. Over time, sex chromosomes typically diverge dramatically in gene
content, gene expression, transposable element content, and levels of genetic variation. These
types of chromosomal changes can be the root of a surprising amount of variation, and we still
have a poor understanding of how and why these changes occur. The proposed research is a
comprehensive examination of chromosome evolution and genome structure in Drosophila, one
of the most powerful and heavily studied systems in genetics. Using chromosome-scale genome
assemblies coupled with genomics and bioinformatics-based approaches, this research will
identify rapidly evolving centromeric satellite sequences across the group to better understand
the tempo of satellite turnover and potential role in karyotypic changes. Additionally, comparative
analyses will for the first time systematically identify genus-wide chromosome evolution and
constraints on gene order and organization. The unique features of Drosophila – numerous
species, small genomes, few chromosomes, ease of karyotyping – make a large-scale
comparative analysis tracking the fates of centromeric satellite sequence and chromosome arms
possible. The proposed research will also investigate a system with very young sex chromosomes
where multiple Y types that vary in their gene content are likely responsible for the evolution of
reproductive incompatibilities between populations. The proposed research will use a
combination of whole genome sequencing and assembly of multiple divergent Y chromosomes,
functional characterization of the diverging X and Y, and population genomic analyses, to link Y
degeneration with restricted gene flow in natural populations. Together, these projects will take
advantage of the unique attributes of two systems to understand the processes that lead to major
changes in karyotype, and variation in degeneration and gene regulation of young sex
chromosomes. More broadly, this research will provide a deeper understanding of the
maintenance of, and variation in, chromosome structure and function that we see across the tree
of life."

Bacteria often grow in close association with solid surfaces. Tissues of the human body such as the oral cavity,
lungs, gut and skin serve as surfaces for colonization by pathogenic bacteria that cause a significant health
burden. Despite the importance of surface-associated bacteria to the development of infections, therapeutic
interventions that target attached cells remain scarce. My laboratory seeks to understand fundamental
mechanisms of how bacteria colonize surfaces. Bacterial cells growing on surfaces display a variety of distinct
physiological characteristics that we refer to collectively as the surface-adapted state. In recent years, the ability
of bacteria to recognize contact with solid substrates has emerged as a critical activator of the surface-adapted
state. A molecular machine called the flagellum participates in these surface sensing systems, but how the
flagellum allows bacteria to respond to physical contact has been difficult to characterize. We recently used a
genetic screen to identify dozens of genes that allow the model bacterium Caulobacter crescentus to respond to
surface contact. Preliminary data collected in my laboratory show that these novel surface sensing factors link
the flagellum to cellular process that are not encompassed by current models for surface colonization. The goal
of the work proposed here is to define how the flagellum coordinates diverse regulatory systems in the cell to
control surface adaptation. We will achieve this goal by (1) elucidating how chemotaxis and mechanosensing
intersect to promote surface responses and (2) determining how surface contact influences cell cycle
progression. The proposed studies leverage my group’s novel insights into the genetic basis for surface
adaptation to define how bacterial cells respond to physical contact. Successful completion of this work will
identify therapeutic targets for treating bacterial infections."
10917251,"Pain is experienced by 30% to 80% of residents living with dementia in nursing homes. For those with
moderate to severe dementia verbal reporting of pain may not be reliable and observational approaches are
recommended as pain in these individuals is more likely to present with facial expressions or behaviors such
as aggression, agitation, or restlessness. Lack of accurate pain assessment results in untreated or over-
treated pain. Untreated pain can lower quality of life, negatively impact function, impair sleep, increase
depression, agitation, aggression, resistiveness to care and use of psychotropic medications. Further, the
evaluation, management and treatment of pain are complicated by differences in pain sensitivity, verbal
reporting or presentation of pain between genders, races and ethnicities. Although inconsistent, in some
studies individuals living with dementia who were Black were more likely to have depression and sleep
disturbances associated with pain and less likely to be treated for pain when compared to White residents.
There are evidence based processes for assessment and management of pain using pharmacologic and
nonpharmacological approaches. These were reviewed and included within the Pain Management Clinical
Practice Guideline (Pain Management CPG) recently developed by AMDA: The Society for Post-Acute and
Long-Term Care Medicine. There are, however, many challenges to translating the use of Clinical Practice
Guidelines into clinical settings. To overcome these challenges we developed and previously tested a
theoretically based approach and merged this approach with the Pain Management CPG, which is referred to
as the PAIN-CPG-EIT. The PAIN-CPG-EIT involves a research nurse facilitator working with an identified
community champion(s) and stakeholder team for 12 months to provide the following four components:
Component I: Establishing and meeting monthly with a Stakeholder Team; Component II: Education of the
staff; Component III: Mentoring and motivating the staff to address pain; Component IV: Ongoing evaluation of
resident pain outcomes. Twelve communities will be included with 25 residents living with dementia and pain
recruited from each community. Six communities will be randomized to treatment (PAIN-CPG-EIT) and six
randomized to education only (EO) which involves providing the same education to staff as is done in
Component II of PAIN-CPG-EIT. The primary aim of this study is to test the effectiveness of use of the PAIN-
CPG-EIT to improve the assessment, diagnosis and management of pain and decrease pain intensity among
nursing home residents living with dementia between baseline, 4 and 12 months and evaluate treatment
fidelity. A secondary aim of the study is to consider differences in measurement, treatment and response to
treatment between male and female and Black versus White residents living with dementia. Findings from this
study will help build on the currently limited information about pain presentation and management among older
adults living with dementia in nursing homes and improve health equity of aging populations experiencing pain."

scholars by the Ohio State University (OSU) College of Dentistry (COD) Oral Biology Graduate Program (OBGP)
and its partner programs in the OSU College of Medicine, the Biomedical Science Graduate Program (BSGP)
and Neuroscience Graduate Program (NSGP). The overarching goal of this integrated pre-doctoral and
postdoctoral training program is to foster the development of future leaders in dental, oral, and craniofacial
research who are specifically equipped to employ multidisciplinary research strategies in basic, translational,
and clinical science, a high-priority objective for the NIDCR. We will achieve this goal by harnessing the
enormous institutional resources available at The Ohio State University and assembling a collaborative team of
productive and dedicated mentors who bring complementary expertise to the program. Training opportunities
include: 1) pre-doctoral training in the OBGP PhD program in the OSU COD and two inter-disciplinary graduate
programs, the BGSP and NSGP, in the OSU College of Medicine; 2) dual degree training for the DDS/PhD
degrees (DSTP); and 3) postdoctoral training including post PhD and clinician/scientist programs. Nationally
recruited trainees will gain invaluable training in research methodology and career development through
structured programs and courses on cross-cutting themes ranging from molecular and cell biology, inflammation
and immunity, big data informatics, and clinical oral health research. In addition to the primary mentor and a
mentoring team, each trainee’s progress will be monitored by an executive committee, and the graduate studies
committee for each graduate program. The program will capitalize on innovative practices at the OSU COD for
recruitment and retention of under-represented minorities and individuals with disabilities. Over the past 10
years, 36 trainees have matriculated into the program and have been mentored by 14 different faculty members.
Our proud training history confirms high level mentoring and support for trainees throughout their entire career
pipeline, including during training (e.g. competitive research awards at IADR, AADOCR and other conferences;
F30/31 grants awarded), at critical transition points (e.g. postdoctoral, residency, and faculty positions attained),
and in long-term benchmarks (e.g. promotion; independent funding; and international recognition of trainee
achievements). In summary, this training program offers an innovative interdisciplinary science curriculum based
on the mechanisms of human disease, and an extensive and flexible curriculum in oral sciences, coupled with
the long-term mentorship of experienced interdisciplinary faculty. As a top 20 NIH-funded state dental school
that is housed in a university with over 40 state-of-the-art core research facilities and 15 interdisciplinary research
centers, the MARTDOCS at OSU is extremely well-equipped to produce highly trained scientists and clinician-

10893546,"Project Summary / Abstract
Mechanical signals play a major role in the regulation of skeletal muscle mass, and the maintenance of muscle
mass contributes significantly to disease prevention and quality of life. Although the link between mechanical
signals and the regulation of muscle mass has been recognized for decades, the mechanisms that control this
process remain ill-defined. For instance, most studies indicate that the mechanically induced growth of skeletal
muscle is driven by an increase in the size of the existing myofibers rather than an increase in the number of
myofibers. Moreover, current models assert that the increase in myofiber size is mediated by an increase in the
balance between the rates of protein synthesis and protein degradation which, in turn, leads to the accumulation
of newly synthesized proteins (NSPs) and the concomitant structural changes that drive the growth response.
For instance, it is well known that an increase in mechanical loading can lead to microstructural changes such
as the radial growth of myofibers. Surprisingly, however, the ultrastructural adaptations that drive these
microstructural changes have not been defined. Indeed, a number of foundationally important questions such as
whether the radial growth of myofibers is driven by an increase in the size and/or the number of myofibrils have
not been answered. Likewise, the location(s) in which NSPs accumulate during mechanically induced growth
(i.e., the sites of growth) are not known. As such, one of the major goals of this project is to fill these gaps in
knowledge. Another major goal is to develop a better understanding of the signaling events that control the
different aspects of mechanically induced growth. For instance, our previous work has established that signaling
through mTORC1 plays a central role in the process via which mechanical stimuli induce the radial growth of
myofibers. However, our preliminary data indicate that the longitudinal growth of myofibers can also make a
substantive contribution to the mechanically induced accretion of muscle mass, yet, unlike radial growth, the
longitudinal growth of myofibers does not appear to require signaling by mTORC1. In other words, our preliminary
data suggest that the radial and longitudinal growth of myofibers are regulated by distinct signaling pathways.
Specifically, we propose that the radial growth of myofibers is driven by a mTORC1-dependent mechanism that
we have coined as the “myofibril expansion cycle”, whereas the longitudinal growth of myofibers is mediated by
a mTORC1-independent mechanism that involves transverse Z-line splitting of sarcomeres at regions called
sphenodes. To test the validity of these hypotheses we will use advanced imaging techniques, various genetic
interventions, two complementary models of mechanical load-induced growth, and our new state-of-the-art
technology that enables us to visualize and quantify (with ≤10 nm resolution) where NSPs accumulate.
Collectively, it is anticipated that the outcomes of this project will not only fill major gaps in our understanding of
how mechanical stimuli regulate muscle mass, but they will also build the framework for future studies that are
aimed at developing a better understanding of this highly important process."

Abstract
The long-term goals of this research program are (1) to develop new computational methods for accurate sim-
ulations of linear and two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectra of proteins and use the developed methods to
simulate recent and design new 2D IR experiments to (2) investigate the mechanisms of ion transport and molec-
ular origins of selectivity in the KcsA ion channel and (3) elucidate the conformational and hydrational changes of
the voltage-sensing domain of the KvAP channel during voltage activation. Despite decades of research, we still
don’t have the direct information on ion channel dynamics and the effects of an applied voltage on ion channel
structures. 2D IR spectroscopy is an emerging analytical technique that probes protein dynamics with chemi-
cal bond-specific spatial and high temporal resolution. 2D IR spectroscopy is analogous to NMR spectroscopy,
except that it uses pulses of infrared light to measure vibrations rather than pulsed magnetic fields for nuclear
spins. New methodology improvements expand the frontiers of 2D IR spectroscopy, permitting the study of com-
plex biological systems in their native environments. Particularly interesting are systems for which NMR and
X-ray crystallography are difficult to apply, such as ion channels. Interpreting congested 2D IR spectra is difficult
without simulations that can quantitatively connect spectral features to atomistic structural models. Currently,
2D IR spectra of proteins are modeled using model-driven, mostly empirical, spectroscopic maps that correlate
solvent-induced electric field and backbone dihedral angles to vibrational frequencies and couplings. This ap-
proach, however, lacks systematic improvability, has limited transferability, provides qualitative accuracy at best,
and is inaccurate for peptides in heterogeneous environments. Shifting away from the model-driven paradigm,
we will use ab initio-based data-driven approaches based on Graph Neural Networks to accurately model the
vibrational spectra of proteins in realistic environments. The proposed methods will provide computational sup-
port for the ongoing and future 2D IR experiments on ion channels. The results of the proposed studies will
significantly enhance our understanding of the molecular-level mechanisms of function of ion channels. A large
spectrum of neurological, cardiovascular, and muscle disorders result from defective ion channel functioning. A
better understanding of the origins of these diseases will pave the way for improved therapeutics that target ion
channels."

The abundance of C(sp3)–H bonds in organic molecules and building blocks, makes the direct functionalization
of these structures a very attractive and powerful tool for the synthesis and late-stage functionalization of
pharmaceuticals. Unfortunately, current methods to achieve these transformations use metal-catalysts and
reagents that do not meet requirements for sustainable development. Similarly, alkyl halides are among the
largest groups of commercially available building blocks used in organic chemistry, but bulky tertiary alkyl
halides cannot be easily used as alkylating agents because they cannot undergo SN2 processes. Therefore,
the development of strategies that are transition-metal-free and orthogonal to current approaches to activate
C–H and C–X bonds would be a significant contribution as it addresses an unmet need.
Recently, the application of electron-donor-acceptor (EDA) complexes has gained attention as a photo-induced
method to perform single electron transfers between otherwise unreactive reagents. Unfortunately, current
reactions that proceed via EDA complexes do not take advantage of the formed radicals to perform hydrogen-
atom-transfer (HAT) and halogen-atom-transfer (XAT) processes that could enable the use of the abundant
chemical feedstock mentioned above.
The research objectives of the proposed investigations promise to tackle the above-cited barriers to help
establish EDA complexes as a cutting-edge strategy for the photo-induced radical-activation of alkanes and
alkyl halides. Our conceptually innovative hypothesis is that sterically and electronically tuned aryl radicals
generated from EDA complexes can be used to achieve site-selective HAT and XAT processes. The resulting
alkyl radicals generated are then coupled to achieve enantio- and diastereoselective cross-couplings. This
work will use computational models to support, guide, and accelerate the design and discovery of EDA
complexes of arenes. These explorations will establish new platforms that enable enantio- and regioselective
cross-dehydrogenative couplings, and XAT mediated couplings that form challenging C(sp3)–C(sp3) bonds."

While AIDS-related morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV (PLWH) have decreased with the
introduction of combination antiviral therapy (ART), HIV continues to kill nearly 1 million people annually, the
majority of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa. Tobacco use among PLWH contributes substantially to the HIV
burden, with nearly a quarter of AIDS-related deaths attributable to smoking. While there is substantial
evidence supporting interventions to help tobacco users in the general population quit, little is available
relevant to the challenges facing HIV+ tobacco users, especially those living in low-income African countries,
including higher rates of depressive symptoms, greater use of alcohol and illegal substances, lack of
awareness about tobacco’s effects on HIV treatment, and social isolation resulting from HIV stigma. We
approach this gap with the first randomized control trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of a tailored short message
service (SMS) based tobacco use cessation intervention on prolonged tobacco use abstinence at 6 months
post program initiation in comparison to the standard of care (brief advice to quit) and nicotine replacement
therapy (nicotine patches) among PLWH in Uganda and Zambia. Our study will provide insight into the
efficacy, feasibility, applicability, and affordability of delivering tobacco cessation interventions through health
care professionals at HIV treatment centers in two countries with different tobacco use patterns, policy
environments, and health care resources and provide needed information to providers and policymakers
looking for cost-effective tobacco cessation interventions. The previously tested SMS-platform to be used in
our study is uniquely positioned to be scaled in low- and middle-income countries worldwide, in which case
rigorous research showing even modest success in reducing the prevalence of tobacco consumption among
PLWH could confer enormous health and economic benefits. The primary partners in the study include the
Center for Tobacco Control in Africa at the Makerere University School of Public Health, the Keck School of
Medicine of USC; and the RAND Corporation; with technical support from the World Health Organization."
10906954,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias (ADRD) are a major public health problem which is
increasing worldwide. Currently, over 5.8 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's or other dementias and
as our population continues to age this number will increase to over 13.8 million by 2050. Great strides are
being made in targeted therapies which may be able to reduce the risk for dementia. However, identifying
which patients should receive these prevention interventions is currently unknown and has been identified by
NINDS and experts in the field as a critical area of research. Research done by our group and others has
demonstrated that risk factor levels as early in life as the 20's influence an individual's future risk for dementia.
Early intervention to prevent the accumulation of risk and targeted interventions for those at high risk could
help to reduce dementia risk. Risk prediction methods can be used to accurately predict who is at high risk for
developing dementia and target interventions; however, current risk prediction models for dementia have
several critical limitations and none have taken into account longitudinal risk factor trajectories, a critical step to
implementing precision prevention approaches to identify individuals at high risk for dementia.
 In this study we propose to develop the Dementia Risk Pooling Project (DRPP) by pooling and
rigorously harmonizing 12 prospective observational cohorts of middle and older age adults, multiple in-person
assessments of clinical, genetic and behavioral risk factors, follow-up of greater than 10 years and adjudicated
dementia ascertainment. The DRPP will be completed and made available to researchers via a cloud-based
computing platform as part of the R61 phase of this proposal meeting specific Go/No-Go Criteria outlined in the
grant. Then, within the R33 phase of this project we will use the DRPP to develop and validate an accurate
and personalized, dynamic dementia risk prediction model which incorporates longitudinal risk factor
measurements and easily updates as new measurements are accrued. This tool can be used clinically to
guide treatment decisions and will be made available to clinicians. The aims of this project are important and
timely, they will provide a risk stratification tool for targeted intervention/prevention for high risk individuals."
10916188,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Given significant, structural changes in the labor market, mothers' employment experiences differ markedly
today than in previous decades. As mothers dramatically increased their labor force participation over the past
50 years, the growth of the service sector and rise of the “24/7 economy” led to an increase in jobs with
nonstandard schedules outside of the traditional Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm work week. The current high
prevalence of maternal nonstandard work schedules raises concerns about the potential adverse effects on
children's health and development. Yet, prior research on mothers' work schedules and child outcomes is
outdated, relying predominantly on samples of families from the 1980s to early 2000s. Increases in precarious
jobs and public investments in child care and early education since then suggest that the effects of mothers'
work schedules on mothers' time with children and child care arrangements, and ultimately on child well-being,
have also changed. The proposed research aims to further knowledge on how maternal employment has
changed in recent decades and its implications for children and families by: (1) documenting and explaining
trends in mothers' work hours and schedules over the past 30 years; (2) assessing how the associations
between mothers' work schedules, mothers' time with children, and child care arrangements have changed
over time and as a result of increased public spending on child care and early education programs; and (3)
examining how mothers' work schedules are associated with children's health and development outcomes in a
contemporary, nationally-representative sample of U.S. households, as well as testing multiple, key mediators
of these associations. The project will generate novel findings on how mothers' employment matters for child
health and development that are necessary for making informed policy decisions about how to best intervene
and support children and families to improve health and well-being over the life course. This K01 award would
provide Dr. Alejandra Ros Pilarz with the training required to become an independent researcher and leading
expert in how parental employment matters for child health and development. The extensive research
infrastructure and support for early career investigators, rich, intellectual environment at the Center for
Demography and Ecology and Institute for Research on Poverty, and a committed mentoring team of experts
in their respective fields make the University of Wisconsin-Madison an ideal environment to complete the
proposed research and training activities. The proposed training plan would allow Dr. Pilarz to receive
instruction and mentorship toward meeting the following career goals: (1) increasing substantive knowledge in
demography and demographic methods; (2) increasing substantive knowledge of family processes, child
health, and middle childhood development; and (3) gaining proficiency in advanced quantitative methods. The
K01 award will lead to an R01 proposal that builds on Dr. Pilarz's newly-acquired substantive knowledge and
methodological skills and will help launch Dr. Pilarz's career as an independent researcher."
10904738,"Project Summary
 Current gold-standard diagnostic techniques for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) rely on behavioral
observation, and diagnosis is often not conferred until after age 4. This delay is unfortunate, because early
intervention can drastically improve outcomes. Given the rapid and sweeping changes in neural architecture,
cognitive ability, and behavioral repertoire that occur within the first year of life, identifying early-emerging
neurobiological markers that can predict abnormal neurodevelopment before behavioral symptoms manifest is
a public health priority. Following the onset of behavioral signs and symptoms, there is great need for stratification
biomarkers that can dissect ASD heterogeneity, thereby informing individualized treatment plans. Such a
precision-medicine approach necessitates greater understanding of the longitudinal pathways of development
in domains. This will set the stage for biomarkers that are sensitive to, and predictive of, changes in behavior
resulting from effective interventions.
 This proposal aims to identify and validate features of temperodynamic brain signal variability that can serve
as diagnostic, risk, and/or treatment response biomarkers of social dysfunction in ASD. Traditionally modeled
out of analyses as mere “noise”, measures of temperodynamic neural variability capture the inherently fluctuating
nature of the brain, which is increasingly understood to play a valuable functional role in the establishment of
neural networks and in the transfer of information throughout the brain. Temperodynamic neural variability has
been linked to cognitive performance, development, and autism.
 The current proposal will capitalize and expand upon this promising neurobiological marker to 1) identify and
optimize metrics for assessing temperodynamic neural variability by conducting the most comprehensive
comparison of time-series analytics of any study to date, and 2) establish these metrics as biomarkers for
neurodevelopmental outcomes by leveraging large clinical and longitudinal data sets consisting of multilevel
genetic, neural, and behavioral data.
 The proposed research extends the candidate’s prior work through new training in autism research,
translational developmental cognitive neuroscience, and timeseries and predictive analytics applied to large-
scale datasets necessary to advance biomarker development. These training goals will support the candidate’s
ultimate career goal of developing an independent research program dedicated to the use of interdisciplinary,
multidimensional, collaborative, and cutting-edge approaches to understanding the neurobiological and
developmental factors that contribute to individual differences in social behavior across the full continuum of
abilities – from healthy to disordered. The University of Virginia is committed to high caliber, collaborative
research and scientific preeminence in neuroscience, autism, and data science and will provide the ideal
environment for conducting this type of interdisciplinary, multidimensional child health-oriented project."
10813188,"Project Summary
Our early studies have characterized IL-9-producing CD4+ T helper (Th9) cells as an antitumor T cell subset.
Recently, we also revealed Th9 cells as a novel T cell paradigm for ACT – they are less exhausted, fully
cytolytic, and hyperproliferative; and efficiently kills targeted antigen-positive tumor cells. In the current project,
we will use tumor models that faithfully recapitulate the clinical scenario of ACT in solid tumors, to uncover
unique features of tumor-specific Th9 cells that enable them to efficiently eradicate advanced solid tumors. We
hypothesize that anti-solid tumor activity of Th9 cells are mainly attributed to both enhanced Th9 cell
penetration into stroma-rich solid tumors and restrain relapse caused by acquired resistance due to high
heterogeneity in tumor antigen expression. Aim 1 will determine the role of Pu.1-dependent MMP12 production
in Th9 cells for their efficient penetration into solid tumors to exert antitumor functions. Aim 2 will determine the
role of Th9 cells in promoting an eATP-enriched milieu to eradicate the TANTs in solid tumors and prevent
acquired resistance. Our proposed studies will identify tumor-specific Th9 cells as the first antitumor T cell
subset that are endowed with the capacity to eliminate solid tumors with the heterogeneity in tumor antigen
expression. This translationally relevant work holds promise to significantly advance the therapeutic index of
ACT in solid tumors and could then lay the foundation for future clinical trials."
10922751,"Project Summary
Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in children is a tragic event that usually results in death or permanent
brain injury in survivors. More than 7000 children suffer OHCA each year in the US and improvements in
pediatric OHCA outcomes, just as in adults, is very much limited by our ability to protect the brain from global
cerebral ischemic injury in those who are successfully resuscitated. Targeted temperature management (TTM)
is currently guideline-recommended in children following OHCA with preference stated for therapeutic
hypothermia (TTM 32-34°C) over normothermia (TTM 36-37.5°C) in order to prevent fever which could amplify
brain injury. The optimal duration and patient selection criteria for therapeutic hypothermia in children remain
unknown and cooling devices are not specifically FDA approved for this indication. Preclinical data and
mechanistic studies strongly suggest that durations of hypothermia longer than those typically used in adults
may minimize brain injury. This study will determine if identifying an optimal duration (dose) of therapeutic
hypothermia can improve outcomes, and if development of a duration response curve can confirm efficacy in a
wider pediatric population of OHCA survivors. We hypothesize that longer durations of cooling will improve
survival and result in better neurologic recovery in survivors compared to shorter cooling durations, as
assessed by the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales–Third Edition (Vineland-3) score. The primary goal of this
project is to identify clinical strategies that will increase the number of patients with improved neurological
recovery from OHCA. The results of this trial will be extremely significant in children and will immediately
impact both clinical practice and regulatory evaluation. The Pediatric Influence of Cooling duration on Efficacy
in Cardiac Arrest Patients (P-ICECAP) trial, modeled after the ongoing adult ICECAP trial, uses innovative
adaptive dose finding methods that allow exploration of a wide range of potential durations and efficiently
allocate subjects where they will be most informative. The study will be conducted using resources of the
NHLBI/NINDS Strategies to Innovate Emergency Care Clinical Trials Network (SIREN), which is experienced
in both pediatric and adult trials, and is currently conducting the current adult ICECAP Trial. SIREN leverages
existing resources to achieve economies of scale and to conduct important clinical investigations spanning
from pre-hospital, through both the emergency department and ICU stay, and post hospital discharge."

Disease of the heart, lungs and blood are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality in pediatric
populations. Children make up 22% of the U.S. population, yet the NIH’s $4 billion pediatric research portfolio
makes up only 10% of the annual NIH research budget. The Nationwide Children’s Hospital Research
Experiences in Childhood Heart, Lung and Blood Sciences (REaCH-LABS) is designed to provide meaningful
summer opportunities for undergraduate students from backgrounds underrepresented in medicine (URiM) in
scientific areas of interest to NHLBI. Each annual cohort will include 5 new participants who are eligible for up
to two years in the program (yielding a total of 10 participating students each year). Our exceptional research
mentorship faculty, representing diversity in both science and demographics, is comprised of over 20 PIs with
current or past NHLBI funding or other relevant federal funding. Participants will be situated within a dynamic
ecosystem of pipeline programs at Nationwide Children’s Hospital spanning high school research internships
thoughT32-funded post-doctoral programs. The curriculum will include 1) an immersive summer research
experience in a research team conducting NHLBI priority research; 2) assignment of a near-peer (medical or
graduate student) mentor to support readiness for transition to graduate or medical school; 3) weekly Heart of
the Matter research seminars providing exposure to active research projects and clinical careers; and 4)
weekly professional development workshops focused on medical school applications, MCATs, interviewing and
other relevant topics. Research team experiences will include meaningful mentored projects that build skills
and produce a product suitable for presentation at the close of the internship. Highly qualified internal and
external review boards will provide guidance on implementation and outcomes and a structured approach to
follow-up will tracking of long-term program outcomes. To maximize our pool of well-qualified URiM
candidates, this project includes a novel partnership with the Student National Medical Association (SNMA),
the nation’s largest organization supporting African American medical students, and its undergraduate affiliate
organization, the Minority Association of Pre-Health Students (MAPS). SNMA leadership and members will
engage in project oversight, participant recruitment, near-peer mentoring, and panel presentations, serving as
both contributors and role models. REaCH-LABS is committed to recruiting, engaging, and supporting URiM
participants in a structure that supports their oft-times unique needs in a way that smooths their path to a
biomedical research career. Our program design will generate well-qualified graduates who add to the diversity
of researchers and research questions, promoting health equity for children and the adults that they will
become."
10894716,"Project Summary. The prevalence of daily cannabis use and Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) has increased in
the United States over the past two decades. Brief, computerized harm reduction interventions that target
specific high-risk CUD populations could be an efficient approach to reducing CUD. Distress intolerance (DI),
which refers to the tendency to negatively appraise and escape aversive emotional states, is a risk factor
associated with stress-related cannabis use motivation and CUD severity/chronicity. Thus, a brief, accessible,
low-cost intervention that reduces DI in those with CUD and elevated DI could have a significant public health
impact. This proposed Stage I project aims to modify an existing two-session computerized distress tolerance
intervention to optimize emotion regulation learning/generalization and test its impact on DI and cannabis use
outcomes in a randomized controlled trial. Specifically, the intervention will be condensed to one-session and
its imaginal exposure module will be modified to shape emotional engagement with the aim of maximizing
within-session habituation, which will be signaled with a novel audio/visual cue (habituation cue). Habituation
cues will then be delivered in just-in-time text message reminders triggered by naturalistic distress reported via
ecological momentary assessment. After obtaining feedback on the modified Emotional Engagement Distress
Tolerance Intervention in a small sample (Specific Aim 1), the intervention’s efficacy compared to a stringent,
credible, time-matched health education control intervention will be tested in a randomized controlled trial in 80
cannabis users with CUD and high DI. To measure the intervention’s mechanistic target engagement (Specific
Aim 2), multi-method DI assessments will be administered through four-month follow-up. To measure the
intervention’s impact on cannabis use (Specific Aim 3a), stress-related cannabis use motivation (lab stress-
elicited craving and neurophysiological drug cue reactivity, ecological momentary assessment of stress-elicited
cannabis use) will be assessed through the intervention period. Interviewer-assessed cannabis use frequency,
CUD severity, and urinary THC metabolite concentration will be measured through 4-month follow-up. Quality
of life and anxiety/depression symptoms will also be measured as secondary outcomes through 4-month
follow-up (Specific Aim 3b). As an exploratory aim, a wristworn device will be used to measure ambulatory
physiology during a portion of the intervention period to evaluate the feasibility of detecting heightened real-
world distress based on objective indicators (Specific Aim 4).Our central hypothesis is that, compared to a
control intervention, the Emotional Engagement Distress Tolerance Intervention will produce superior
reductions in multi-method assessments of DI, stress-related cannabis use motivation, disordered cannabis
use, and psychosocial functioning. Successful completion of the proposed aims will (1) justify a subsequent
Stage II trial, and (2) inform efforts to integrate the just-in-time habituation reminders with wearable technology
in order to increase emotion regulation generalization opportunities and decrease participant report burden."
10828888,"Summary/Abstract
The 2016 report issued by the Surgeon General’s Office, “Facing Addiction in America,” the
first of its kind issued by the Surgeon General, brought into stark relief the major impact of
substance misuse and use disorders and the need to rethink how prevention and treatment
services are currently delivered in the United States. While isolated aspects of substance misuse
are improving, such as tobacco cessation and opioid prescribing practices, enormous service gaps
persist that allow the ongoing and enormous negative impacts of risky and problem substance
use. Further, these negative impacts put a particular burden on gender and ethnic minorities and
other disadvantaged populations and communities. The isolation of specialist substance abuse
treatment from mainstream medicine, the report further points out, presents a barrier to a
potentially more effective public health model to reduce substance-related harms. If this
landscape of epidemic substance misuse, use disorders, and related conditions is to improve and
patient and public health and safety outcomes enhanced, prevention and treatment services
delivery require rethinking. The Addiction Health Services Research conference, held since
2005, has annually brought together researchers, policy makers, and treatment providers to focus
upon how such systems redesign might most effectively be implemented and sustained. In the
current application, we propose to enhance this conference by specifically focusing on improving
the well-being of gender and ethnic minorities and other marginalized groups struggling with
risky and problem substance use. We encourage participation by underrepresented scientists
through the establishment of a NIDA Minority Investigator Award and enhancement of a junior
investigator mentoring program. A slate of distinguished plenary speakers, discussion of cutting-
edge health services research findings, the development of collaborative relationships, and
support of the careers of junior and minority investigators is proposed to move forward an
agenda of broadening the positive impact of prevention and treatment services for substance
misuse and use disorders."

The Division of Neonatal and Developmental Medicine at Stanford University submits a competing renewal
application to participate in the NICHD Neonatal Research Network (NRN). The Division and its faculty
members have a long history of innovative research accomplishments in neonatal medicine. This expertise
dovetails with the NRN goal of conducting definitive and rigorous multicenter trials and observational studies in
newborns to improve survival without neurodevelopmental impairment. As a participant in the NRN since 1991,
this center has proven to be highly productive, contributing to leadership, study design, protocol development,
execution, analysis, and results dissemination. Led by PI, Krisa Van Meurs, Alternate PI, Valerie Chock, and
Follow-up PI, Susan Hintz, the site neonatologists and subspecialty collaborators have wide-ranging expertise
and significant clinical research experience with 613 manuscripts published in neonates since 2016. Within the
NRN, Stanford investigators have 55 subcommittee assignments and appear as co-authors 117 times on NRN
manuscripts. Dr. Van Meurs is Chair of the Publications Committee and coordinated 131 manuscript reviews,
spearheaded a review of NRN policies leading to a reduction in time to publication, and was Editor for the
Seminars in Perinatology volume describing NRN contributions over the last grant cycle. As Lead Follow-up PI
and Chair of Follow-up Protocol Development, Dr. Hintz has been responsible for advancing protocols and
proposals, and assuring the quality of NRN follow up visits, and enhancing rigor of training and certification
procedures. During the COVID pandemic she led re-envisioning of certification processes, launched new tools,
and developed individualized improvement plans for challenged sites. Cody Arnold is Co-PI for the ongoing
Cycled Phototherapy trial. Valerie Chock led a NHLBI-funded secondary to the Transfusion in Prematures trial
on near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), Dr. Van Meurs led a secondary to the Optimizing Cooling trial on
amplitude-integrated EEG, and Courtney Wusthoff led a secondary study to the Preemie Hypothermia trial on
EEG. Stanford neuroradiologists have been MRI central readers for all the NRN cooling trials. The Stanford
site with its 2 satellite sites, El Camino Hospital and Santa Clara Valley Medical Center, provide an annual
delivery base of >12,000 births with 59% born to high risk mothers, 140 NICU beds, and >1900 NICU
admissions with 83% inborn. Two sites anticipate growth in deliveries over the next 3 years. Our aggregate
population is diverse in comparison to the rest of the US with 25% Asian and 52% Hispanic. Over the last 6
grant cycles Stanford has demonstrated wide-ranging expertise, exceptional leadership, and strong
collaborative abilities that have served the NRN well. One of the greatest strengths Stanford has to offer is our
extensive and talented pool of young clinical investigators that will become the clinical research leaders of the
future. In summary, the Stanford site has the neonatal and subspecialty faculty, physical space, research
resources, professional staff, institutional support, and patient population necessary to continue as one of the
finest centers participating in the NRN."
10818476,"The purpose of this proposal is to demonstrate the capabilities of the University of Pittsburgh to
continue to participate as a clinical site in the Eunice Kennedy Shriver NICHD Maternal-Fetal
Medicine Units Network (MFMUN). We are particularly well suited to be a clinical site in this
Network because of our delivery volume; clinical research infrastructure and track record; basic
and translational experience and expertise; and specialized resources that we can bring to the
Network. Approximately 10,000 women deliver per year at Magee-Womens Hospital, and 75%
of these women initiate prenatal care in our system at < 14 weeks. Our site, a large volume
delivery-perinatal center under a unified administrative structure, is ideal for participation in the
MFMU Network. Through our extensive research infrastructure, we have successfully enrolled
women as early as the first trimester, followed them longitudinally through pregnancy to
delivery, conducted randomized clinical interventions, and have performed serial collection and
processing of biological samples and ultrasound data. We also have demonstrated success in
longitudinal postnatal maternal and neonatal follow-up. The demography of our population
allows us to contribute uniquely to the study of preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy
outcomes. Additionally, our site brings unique content and technical expertise in clinical
obstetrics, fetal imaging, genomics and proteomics, placental pathology, and epidemiology. All
these areas are represented among our faculty, and we have a long and successful history of
research collaboration, within our institution and via multicenter studies. In this application, we
aim to: 1. To describe our experience, infrastructure, and track record of participation in single-
center and multicenter studies of adverse pregnancy outcomes 2. To demonstrate our ability to
enroll a diverse patient population and demonstrate our ability to continue to enroll and provide
maternal and newborn follow-up to subjects for ongoing and new MFMU studies 3. To delineate
our unique suitability in terms of technical and multidisciplinary content expertise to
address the objectives of the MFMU Network."
10883704,"Influenza is a common respiratory infection with substantial disease and economic burdens. Due to the threat of
another global pandemic, significant resources have been devoted to increase influenza surveillance, laboratory
capacity and pandemic preparedness worldwide since 2009. Disease burden estimates are critical for evaluating
vaccine benefits, for communicating prevention and control messages, and for developing evidence-based
policies for resource allocations. There are several major analytical challenges in estimating influenza disease
burden. First influenza symptoms are non-specific and testing is conducted at the discretion of healthcare
providers. Severe complications (e.g., pneumonia and cardiovascular events) may occur weeks after infection
when influenza viruses are no longer detectable or the patient’s symptoms may not suggest influenza. Second,
policy-relevant evaluation of influenza burdens at the national or global scales are often limited by the availability
of high-quality surveillance data. A common approach is to create multipliers for extrapolating available burden
estimates to other locations or larger populations, while introducing considerable uncertainties. There is a
pressing need to develop methods and tools to support burden estimation that will increase accuracy, improve
precision, enhance multi-partner collaboration, and quantify uncertainty appropriately. In this 2-year exploratory
project, we will examine the use of state-of-the-art approaches from epidemiology and evidence synthesis to
influenza burden estimation. In Aim 1, we will develop single-site time-series models for attributing counts of
adverse respiratory health outcomes to influenza. Our models will address several commonly encountered
analytic challenges, including residual temporal autocorrelation, overdispersion, and unmeasured temporal
confounders. By leveraging a unique multi-state emergency department (ED) visits database and three national
influenza surveillance systems, these methods will be applied to estimate season-specific influenza-associated
ED visits for 102 U.S. during the period 2005 to 2018. We will estimate burdens for specific age groups, sex and
influenza types. In Aim 2, we will develop data integration models for combining information across multiple sites
and perform predictions to sites without burden estimates. This involves the use of privacy-preserving, distributed
algorithms for multi-site analyses that can incorporate individual participant data, improve accuracy, account for
reporting bias, and potentially encourage participation. Methods will be applied to (1) estimate annual season-
specific influenza-associated ED visits in the U.S. nationally, and (2) estimate global burden of influenza-
associated hospitalization as part of an ongoing collaboration with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. Anticipated outcomes from this project include (1) feasibility and performance evaluations of the
proposed time-series and data integration models; and (2) substantive findings on influenza-associated morbidity
as measured by ED visits and hospitalization for respiratory disease. Moreover, models developed in this project
are also widely applicable to other respiratory pathogens."
10880356,"ABSTRACT
Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment by reversing the immune suppression of cytotoxic anti-
tumor CD8+ effector T cells. However, glioblastoma patients have profound lymphopenia and immune
checkpoint inhibition treatment does not restore T cell immune function. Extensive characterization by our group
has demonstrated that glioblastoma is fundamentally different relative to other malignancies in its preferential
enrichment of innate immune cells such as macrophages and microglia that are recruited to the tumor
microenvironment. These innate immune cells are tumor supportive. In a genetically-engineered mouse model
(GEMM) of glioblastoma we recapitulated lympophenia using a CD8 knockout (KO) background, and found
marked enrichment of PD-1 expressing macrophages in the murine glioma microenvironment – similar to
observations made in human glioblastoma patients. We evaluated the effect of anti-PD-1 Ab delivered
intravenously in glioblastoma-bearing wild-type mice and in the CD8 KO background and found therapeutic
benefit even in the absence of the CD8 effector T cell. Both peripheral monocyte-derived macrophages and
resident microglia were reduced within the glioblastoma microenvironment in mice treated with the anti-PD-1 Ab.
As such, our overall study hypothesis is that anti-PD-1 exerts therapeutic immune modulatory effects against
glioblastoma through innate immunity in the central nervous system (CNS). This proposal will address multiple
crucial questions to the field including: 1) Does the anti-PD-1 Ab cross into the CNS to exert a therapeutic effect;
2) what immune cells, other than the CD8 T cell, are contributing to the therapeutic effect of this agent; 3) are
the immune cells that are mediating the therapeutic effect arising from the periphery or are they intrinsic to the
CNS; and 4) how does the glioblastoma immune microenvironment change in response to treatment? To
address these questions, we will use contemporary murine models of glioma that closely approximate human
glioblastoma and manipulate both the innate and adaptive immune systems to dissect the impact and importance
of each in the context of anti-PD-1 treatment. Validation will be carried out using data from human subjects
treated with anti-PD-1. By clarifying the mechanistic role of anti-PD-1 therapeutic activity, we may identify the
subset of glioblastoma patients that are capable of responding to this type of strategy. This is a significant area
of unmet need if glioblastoma patients are to benefit from immunotherapy. These studies may also reveal that
anti-PD-1 treatment has a dual role on both the innate and adaptive immune system and when one arm is not
operational this agent toggles its modulatory properties to the dominant immune arm."
10901877,"PROJECT ABSTRACT. My long term career objective is to define the mechanisms of liver inflammation in
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the most-prevalent chronic liver disease in the United States of America.
NASH is characterized by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which results in release of proinflammatory
extracellular vesicles (EVs) from lipid overloaded (lipotoxic) hepatocytes. The contribution of recruited
monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) to the intrahepatic macrophage (IHM) pool increases in NASH and
the recruited MDMs play a pivotal role in inflammation. The current proposal examines the mechanistic link
between hepatocyte-derived EVs and specific MDM subsets. In preliminary studies we have identified that
activation of the lipotoxic ER stress activated endoribonuclease, inositol requiring enzyme 1 alpha (IRE1α) and
its target transcription factor X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), upregulates the expression of S100A11. This
upregulation of S100A11 is associated with activating, histone 3 lysine 27, acetylation in the enhancer region
of S100A11. Lipotoxic hepatocytes release S100A11 containing EVs (S100A11-EVs). S100A11-EVs activate
macrophage receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) signaling. Hepatocellular expression of
S100A11 and MDM expression of RAGE are upregulated in NASH. Silencing S100A11 decreases MDM-
associated hepatic inflammation in NASH. Based on these original preliminary data, we have formulated the
CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS that lipotoxic hepatocytes release S100A11-EVs which activate a subset of
proinflammatory RAGE expressing IHMs promoting NASH pathogenesis. Therefore, the goals of this
proposal are to understand: i) how S100A11-EVs are released by hepatocytes; ii) how RAGE is activated by
lipotoxic EVs in a subset of macrophages; and iii) can hepatic inflammation be attenuated by inhibiting
S100A11-EV-RAGE signaling? The proposed experiments will employ complementary in vitro and in vivo
models of lipotoxicity and NASH, and pharmacological, molecular and genetic approaches to address three
integrated hypotheses. First we will directly test the hypothesis that lipotoxic hepatocytes release S100A11-
EVs a) by XBP1 driven transcriptional upregulation of S100A11 by binding to and recruiting histone acetylating
factors to an enhancer region, and b) by selective cargo sorting of S100A11 into lipotoxic EVs. Second we will
directly test the hypothesis that RAGE is activated in a subset of macrophages by lipotoxic EVs a) by
generating multivalent signal competent RAGE oligomers, and b) leads to the accumulation of a subset of
proinflammatory RAGE expressing macrophages in the liver. Third we will directly test the hypothesis that
interrupting S100A11-EV induced RAGE activation attenuates murine NASH a) by reducing the release of
S100A11-EVs, and b) when macrophage RAGE is deleted. This R01 grant application will yield mechanistic
insights into hepatocyte-to-macrophage crosstalk in NASH, thus identifying potentially druggable targets, e.g.,

adrenergic antagonist (BAA), topically to treat diabetic foot ulcers. We hypothesize that topical
timolol is more effective in achieving wound closure than using the standard of care (SOC)
treatment for diabetic foot ulcers, and is a safe therapeutic alternative.
Research Design/Methods: The study is a Phase 2 randomized, double blinded, controlled
and parallel-group clinical trial with 2 treatment arms, receiving either the SOC plus topical
Timoptic-XE® or a control group receiving SOC plus a non biologically active gel (hydrogel, as
placebo medicine).
The study population will be selected from the VA Northern California Health Care System,
Veterans who present with diabetic foot ulcers. We will require 24 subjects enrolled in each
treatment arm, for a total of 48 sample size to provide a power of 80% to detect a 43 %
difference, with 63% healing in the timolol group and 20% with the standard of care, at a
significance level 0.05 and an overall attrition will be 35%.
We will perform simple allocation of the subjects using an electronic randomization for
treatment assignment. Following recruitment, patients that have met the eligibility criteria and
signed an informed consent, will then undergo two weeks of baseline screening to screen out
rapid healers. Next, the patient will be randomly assigned treatment, with unique identifiers
assigned, with subject and investigator blinded as to treatment. Subjects will topically apply
daily either the treatment medication or the placebo on the foot ulcer for 12 weeks, or until
healed, whichever comes first.
Measurements of wound size and other data will be collected at baseline, followed by weekly
visits for 12 weeks, and then a follow-up period. The maximum study duration for any subject is
31 weeks with 3 phases (two weeks in the Screening Phase, up to 12 weeks in the Active Phase
including a confirmatory visit, followed by a second confirmatory visit a week later, and one
month and three-month in the Follow-Up Phase).
Analysis: The primary end point of wound closure (skin re-epithelialization without drainage
or dressing requirements) at 12 weeks will be analyzed using the two-sided Fisher's exact test.
Secondary outcomes such as the rate of ulcer healing by the 12th week of care, time to achieve
complete ulcer closure, recidivism, occurrence of adverse events will be analyzed with p- value
adjustments. A two-way ANOVA with a post hoc test will be used to relate timolol serum levels
to wound healing. The analysis of the wound characteristics, the subjects' characteristics, and
the safety parameters will be performed using logistic regression. Subjects will complete the
Veterans Rand (VR-36) Health Survey to evaluate quality of life, the Lower Extremity
Functional Scale, which will be analyzed along with the Charlson co-morbidity index, using
ANCOVA."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
   
Over 40,000 Veterans who served in the 1991 Gulf War (GW) have a persistent form of chronic multisymptom illness that defines Gulf War Veterans Illness (GWVI). With no existing proven treatments to provide relief to these sufferers, it is critical to find efficacious and acceptable treatments for GWVI.  Our long-term goal is to develop a safe, readily available, mind-body treatment to reduce pain and other chronic symptoms and enhance wellness in Veterans with GWVI. Tai Chi is a traditional Chinese mind-body therapy that has been practiced for centuries. In the last decade, we have demonstrated that Tai Chi can improve both physical health and psychological well-being in patients with a variety of chronic conditions.  The proposed randomized trial will establish the effectiveness of a Tai Chi mind-body treatment in Veterans with GWVI. One hundred and twenty participants meeting criteria for GWVI will be randomly assigned to either a Tai Chi exercise or a stretching and wellness education group for 12 weeks with a post-treatment assessment, and follow-up assessments. For an exploratory sub-study, 40 Veterans (approximately 20 from each condition) will undergo MRI scanning at each assessment point. We will accomplish the following Specific Aims:  Specific Aim 1: Evaluate whether the Tai Chi intervention will reduce symptoms of pain in Veterans with GWVI more than the Wellness intervention. We hypothesize that participants randomized to the Tai Chi intervention will show a greater reduction in pain symptoms than those in the Wellness intervention and will maintain changes over a 9-month follow-up period.  Specific Aim 2: Evaluate whether the Tai Chi intervention improves fatigue, cognition, quality of life, and physical functioning in GW Veterans with GWVI, as compared to the Wellness intervention. We hypothesize that participants randomized to the Tai Chi intervention will evidence more improvement in fatigue, cognitive functioning, quality of life, and physical functioning than those
randomized to the Wellness intervention and will maintain changes over a 9-month follow-up period.  Specific Aim 3: Explore a potential neurobiological mechanism by which Tai Chi can reduce pain and other symptoms and improve quality of life in Veterans with GWVI. We hypothesize differences in resting state fMRI and on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in participants randomized to the Tai Chi intervention compared with Wellness intervention participants and that these differences will maintain over the 9-month follow-up period.  The proposed trial, informed by our prior investigations, with a robust study design and strong research team, will produce valuable results that can have a direct and immediate impact on healthcare practices for GWVI. If proven as an effective treatment for the symptoms of GWVI, this non-pharmaceutical treatment could easily be implemented in VA facilities, and Veterans could be taught how to continue to practice independently within their own homes. Providing GW Veterans even moderate relief from chronic and debilitating symptoms of GWVI could have a profound impact on improving their overall sense of well-being and quality of life, the ultimate measure of treatment efficacy."
10861926,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Skeletal muscle plays a fundamental role in health maintenance throughout the lifespan. Loss of muscle mass
can have long-lasting deleterious consequences leading to prolonged periods of convalescence and increased
mortality. Muscle growth and maintenance are largely determined by the ability of the muscle to synthesize
proteins, which in turn is regulated by muscle ribosome. Ribosome production is partly controlled by transcription
of ribosomal (r)RNA genes (rDNA) by RNA Polymerase I, and is modulated by the transcriptional suppressors
Rb and p130. In this proposal, we seek to understand how the removal Rb and p130 leads to enhanced
transcription of rRNA genes and muscle hypertrophy. Using a novel animal model, we report exciting preliminary
results indicating that genetic removal of Rb and p130 leads to enhanced ribosome production and skeletal
muscle hypertrophy. Using this and other supporting models, we will define novel mechanisms controlling rRNA
gene expression by studying the role of transcription and chromatin remodeling factors exerting modulatory
functions on rDNA. These studies will significantly advance the field and generate novel targets for the
development of therapies to prevent the loss of muscle mass and function."
10893396,"Summary
Nitrite and nitric oxide are widespread and robust signaling modulators that are emerging as
potential new antibacterial therapeutic agents. The oral cavity has particularly high concentrations
of nitrite, which can reach 1mM. Oral microorganisms have adapted to survive such high
nitrosative stress exposure and, we expect, that disruption of these adaptation mechanisms will
reduce growth and survival of bacteria in the oral environment. We know that Porphyromonas
gingivalis, a periodontopathogen, has high tolerance of nitrosative stress. However, the complex
signaling pathways setting the basis of this tolerance are yet to be determined in in this bacterium
as well as in other oral bacteria. Using whole genome expression analysis we have identified hcp
encoding newly re-designated S-nitrosylase as the most dramatically upregulated gene under
nitrosative stress. Furthermore, we demonstrated that regulation of Hcp is dependent on an FNR-
like regulator, HcpR, that employs novel hemin-dependent mechanism to sense nitrosative stress.
We hypothesize that the HcpR-Hcp system is central for adaptation of P. gingivalis to nitrosative
stress. Thus, we will first define the molecular mechanisms of P. gingivalis sensing nitrosative
stress through determination of the structural and biochemical characteristics of HcpR. Since
adaptation to nitrosative stress involves a novel enzymatic activity mediated by Hcp, we will
characterize the Hcp-mediated S-nitrosylome using proteomic approaches. In addition, we will
characterize the mechanism P. gingivalis Hcp employs to mediate protection against nitrosative
stress. Finally, we will investigate the contribution of other putative regulatory and effector
proteins in nitrosative stress defense in P. gingivalis. It is noteworthy, that we will verify the
contribution of the mechanisms under host-pathogen setting. This knowledge will provide the tools
to design agents that can compromise the defense mechanisms of the periodontopathogen and
turn endogenous human host nitrite and nitric oxide into a weapon that inhibits growth of the
bacterium and, ultimately, we can exploit it to treat periodontal disease. We predict that this work
will shed light on nitrosative stress signaling mechanisms in a variety of other bacteria that carry
similar nitrosative stress protection mechanisms to those in P. gingivalis."
10909910,"This Collaborative Merit Review Award for Research (I01) proposed in response to RFA BX-18-007 from the
Veteran Health Administration is a joint effort by investigators from the JJ Peters VA Medical Center (Bronx,
NY) Project 1, Arnold School of Public Health and Wm Jennings Bryan Dorn VA Medical Center (Columbia,
SC) Project 2, Brain Science Center VA Medical Center (Minneapolis, MN) Project 3. We define a vision for
an integrated and multidisciplinary program of preclinical research projects all linked by the ultimate goal to
better characterize the mechanism of persistent and aberrant immunological activity in Gulf War Veteran
Illnesses (GWVI) by developing experimental model systems, with the ultimate goal of developing novel
therapeutic interventions. Gulf War Veterans’ Illnesses is a multifaceted disorder characterized by a range of
symptoms including cognitive impairment, fatigue, pain, mood disorders, among others. Recent evidence
suggests that the onset and progression of these symptoms may be the result of disequilibrium in these
subjects’ immune systems. During deployment GWV were exposed to a unique variety of toxic agents that
were specific to the Gulf War theatre, such as pyridostigmine bromine (PB), diisopropyl fluorophosphates
(DFP), permethrin, and depleted uranium which current evidence indicates lowered thresholds to
immunological responses and resulted in the persistent and heightened activity of certain arms of the immune
system; a phenomenon best described as “immunological priming”. In addition, they received more than 20
vaccines that could have overloaded the immune system. In support of these considerations, subjects with
GWVI often have shown pathological signatures in common with autoimmune disorders and generalized
inflammatory disorders, such as increased plasma concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, unspecific
tissue degeneration, and organ failure. Based on this concept, the three proposed collaborative research
projects were designed to better understand how primed immune systems may contribute to GWVI- type
phenotypes by exploring how multiple GWI conditions recapitulated in animal models may synergize and
eventually provide new mechanistic evidence for translation studies. For example, Project 2 was designed to
understand how GW toxin induced gut inflammasome activation causes gut dysbiosis and may lead to
persistent or heightened immune-inflammatory responses and GWVI symptoms. As the goal of Project 3 is
designed the hypothesis that lack of specific immunity leads to vaccine-induced inflammatory reaction in the
brain, Project 2 will collaborate with project 3 to test the contribution of inflammasome priming and genetic
diversity to gut dysbiosis and persistent immunological responses. Similarly, Project 1, which is designed to
test how immunological priming may heighten inflammatory responses to psychological stressors, will
collaborate with project 2 and project 3 by exploring how the NLRP3 inflammasome may contribute to
heightened inflammation induced by gut dysbiosis or HLA polymorphisms, respectively. The outcome of these
studies is of great interest not only because this will establish a novel link between inflammasome priming,
genetic diversity and gut-dysbiosis toxemic response, but it will also provide insight to test novel therapeutic
approaches that target the persistent activation of the immune system, either using immunotherapeutic
approaches against vaccine toxins, probiotics to attenuate gut dysbiosis. Our proposed studies are innovative
in terms of their scope, since it will fill the fundamental gaps needed for future translational studies. Most
importantly our multiscale technological innovative approaches, which include knockout murine models of
GWVI, including for the HLA and NLRP3 proteins, will enable our interdisciplinary research team with
outstanding expertise in neuroscience, pharmacology, microbiology, chemistry to thoroughly investigate the
molecular mechanisms underlying the etiology of GWVI."
10889164,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Metastatic ovarian cancer (OvCa) is the leading cause of death from gynecologic cancer. Despite aggressive
chemotherapy and surgery, most patients (80%) experience intraabdominal progression or recurrence to visceral
adipose tissue in the abdominal cavity. For more than 15 years, my laboratory has concentrated on elucidating
the biology of OvCa metastasis, focusing on understanding how deregulation of the tumor microenvironment
(TME) promotes OvCa metastasis and chemotherapy resistance. We defined the contribution of multiple stromal
cell types to metastasis, revealing a critical role for a methyltransferase (NNMT) in the reprogramming of normal
fibroblasts into cancer-associated fibroblasts through metabolic remodeling. Additionally, we answered the
decades-old question of why abdominally metastasizing tumors have a propensity to metastasize to the
omentum, finding that adipokines attract cancer cells to adipose tissue, and that adipocytes provide long-chain
fatty acids to cancer cells for energy production through β-oxidation. However, fundamental questions remain
about metabolic processes in OvCa progression. How are OvCa metastases metabolically different from primary
tumors? Which fuels/metabolites are altered after chemotherapy, and how do they contribute to chemotherapy
resistance? Given that immunotherapies are effective in several epithelial tumors, one of the more puzzling and
timely questions is why checkpoint inhibitors are ineffective in OvCa. My hypothesis is that cancer associated
adipocytes contribute to therapy resistance and immune effector cell exhaustion through the lipid-driven
metabolic reprogramming of the TME. We have adapted methods to perform in vivo metabolic flux analysis in
OvCa patients, by infusing labeled metabolites (non-radioactive 13C-glucose, acetate) and are working on
methods to optimize compartment resolved metabolomics on tumor tissue using imaging mass spectrometry.
These data will allow us to define metabolic changes in cancer, immune, and stromal cells before and after
neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The hypotheses generated by these studies will be tested with wide-ranging
experimental approaches using primary organotypic 3D cultures and mouse models. Our experimental approach
will span functional cellular assays (to study adhesion, migration, and invasion), confocal imaging, biochemical
activity assays, and newly devised methods to test the functionality of natural killer cells, T-cells, and
macrophages in vitro and in vivo. Compartment-specific insights into metabolic changes in the tumor organ will
be employed to develop high-throughout screening campaigns. These should discover small molecule inhibitors
that can be optimized through an established and structured process towards clinical testing. We believe that,
by targeting metabolic processes identified in the tumor organ, we can greatly enhance anti-tumor therapy
response in OvCa, potentially halting the inexorable progression characteristic of this deadly disease."
10888303,"Endothelial cell (EC) activation and dysfunction increases with age and is linked to a variety of chronic vascular
inflammatory disease states including atherosclerosis—the major cause of morbidity and mortality in Western
Societies. Vascular senescence induced by the DNA damage response (DDR) promotes chronic inflammation
in atherosclerotic lesions. Senescence-associated proinflammatory cytokines and proatherogenic risk factors
(acquired or inherited) such as hyperlipidemia activate key signaling pathways that increase expression of
adhesion molecules, chemokines on several cell types, including the vascular endothelium. Therefore,
suppressing the senescence-associated inflammatory response in the vascular endothelium may provide a
novel therapeutic approach to limit atherosclerosis.
 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, single-stranded, evolutionary conserved non-coding RNAs that
suppress the expression of target genes at the post-transcriptional level and participates in a variety of
pathophysiological processes including the regulation of inflammatory responses. Our group provided the initial
link implicating miR-181b in suppressing endothelial cell inflammation. During the last grant period, we
identified miR-181b as a nodal regulator of endothelial cell quiescence through its regulatory effects on two
major signaling pathways – NF-κB and AKT/eNOS. Consequently, endogenous miR-181b was found to
function as a key determinant of the inflammatory response in vivo, findings that correlate with human
inflammatory states including established coronary artery disease. We now identify endothelial miR-181b as a
critical determinant of systemic vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis by controlling vascular senescence
and the DNA damage response. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the adenosine-A3AR signaling pathway, a
translationally relevant target that suppresses endothelial activation, functions in a miR-181b-dependent
manner. These observations provide the foundation for the central hypothesis that endothelial miR-181b, via
inhibitory effects on the DNA damage response, regulates senescence-associated vascular inflammation and
atherosclerosis. To better understand the precise role of miR-181b in regulating vascular senescence,
inflammation, and atherosclerosis, we propose 3 aims. In Aim1, we will determine the molecular basis for miR-
181b to regulate the DNA damage response and vascular senescence in response to diverse stimuli. In Aim2,
we will explore the effect of altering miR-181b expression on senescence-associated secretory phenotype and
atherosclerotic progression and regression in young and aged mice. In Aim3, we will determine whether the
anti-senescent effects of adenosine in the vascular endothelium depend on miR-181b. This multi-disciplinary
team in the fields of non-coding RNA biology, molecular imaging, nanomedicine, bioinformatics, and
atherosclerosis research will establish an unprecedented molecular view of this miRNA in lesions that can
inform a new frontier in the regulation of vascular senescence and atherosclerosis."
10892660,"Understanding the brain processes underlying alcohol use and misuse are essential for the development of
effective treatments for alcohol use disorder or AUD. Human brain imaging has greatly contributed to our current
understanding of AUD, but much more remains to be understood. Most recently, human neuroscience has been
transformed by the integration of network science and neuroimaging (now coined network neuroscience).
Functional brain imaging is used to generate networks to examine interconnected groups of synchronized
brain regions. The overarching hypothesis of this project is that brain synchronization is only half of the
brain network story. This work asserts that functional brain networks actually have two critical sublayers.
The first layer is the well-established network of synchronization that is identified using correlation methods,
called the cooperative functional network (cFN). The second layer is a proposed network that resists
synchronization and is called the impervious functional network (iFN). The iFN is essential for shifting
synchronization within and between subnetworks to support shifts in cognitive demands. The two layers
coexist in tension, each playing their own role to support stable, yet flexible, brain function. This project
combines mathematical modeling and simulation with application of the methods to predict alcohol drinking
behavior in National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) data set.
Success of this project will demonstrate that both cFN and iFN are essential components of a more complete
understanding of normal and abnormal brain function. There is a desperate need for a deeper understanding
of alcohol use/misuse and for better diagnosis and treatment of AUD. Unfortunately, potential biomarkers
and treatment trials targeting these conditions have continually failed. This project could have transformative
potential as it brings forth a previously undiscovered organizational principle of the brain, and could lead to new
diagnostic and therapeutic strategies designs based on the combined knowledge of the cFN and iFN. In
addition to transforming our understanding of AUD, this work has the potential to revolutionize clinical
studies and the care of patients with a range of brain disorders."
10897108,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Research for Ethical Data Science in Southern Africa (REDSSA) project has the overall aims of producing
new knowledge in regard to the ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI) of conducting data science research,
to develop evidence-based, context specific guidance for the conduct and governance of data science initiatives
such as DS-I Africa, and to strengthen the culture of responsible data science in Southern Africa. The project
will be conducted in three phases.
Phase 1 is research intensive and will obtain empirical data on key stakeholder views regarding the development
of data science guidance to inform governance of DSI-Africa Research Hubs in Southern Africa. This phase will
start with conceptual research and normative analysis of the ELSI issues related to data science. Important
concepts to explore will include data sovereignty where data protection is balanced with responsible data
sharing. Given that digital data is often experienced as intangible and abstract by the lay public, the project will
employ crowdsourcing as a form of citizen science to inform the development of innovative educational tools that
could be adapted for stakeholder engagement in data science in the DS-I Africa network. Using these tools, we
will conduct in-depth interviews with key stakeholders to ascertain their experiences with ELSI-data science
related challenges, gaps in current guidance and their views on procedural and substantive aspects of guidance
development in data science governance. Key themes that emerge from the empirical research will underpin our
approach to co-creation of guidelines, procedures and policies required in the DS-I Africa consortium. During
phase 1, ethics consultants embedded in the Research Hubs will address emerging ELSI concerns.
In Phase 2 of this project, we will develop guidance documents informed by phase 1 research and by best
practices in international data science research guidance, the limited experience and existing literature to date
concerning data science research and governance of data management in Southern Africa. Importantly, such
guidance will be informed by the values of solidarity, sharing and mutual benefit - important concepts in Southern
African moral frameworks based on communal good. This approach is congruent with health data ecosystems
that require different stakeholders to work collaboratively for health innovation. The results of these policy-related
activities will be tempered with key concerns and principles identified in our conceptual and empirical work and
will provide locally grounded, practical guidance on the ELSI of data science research conducted in the hubs.
In Phase 3 of the project, we aim to amplify the impact and enhance the sustainability of our research and
governance activities by creating ELSI networks and communication channels focusing on data science in
Southern Africa. This will involve establishing an ELSI Data Science Southern African Network (EDSSAN) to
respond to evolving ELSI concerns in DS-I Africa Research Hubs beyond the funding period, hosting annual
conferences, and leveraging existing local networks."
10832654,"Project Summary
This proposal aims to develop safer and effective drug for the treatment of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT),
an infectious disease that are endemic to sub-Saharan Africa. HAT is of global health concerns due to the lack
of hope for prevention by vaccination and the unsatisfactory treatment options. There is need for the development
of new drugs with novel mechanism of action. To rationally develop a good drug, it is important to identify
molecular targets in the parasites. These target molecules should fulfill the following criteria: (i) important for the
parasites’ survival, (ii) absent in humans or not important in humans, and (iii) if present in humans, it should be
structurally different from the human molecule. After which we can then search for chemical compounds that can
specifically interact with the target molecules to stop them from functioning, and eventually killing the parasites.
The energy (ATP) metabolism pathway of blood stream forms of the trypanosomes (BSFs) presents such a
novel target for drug discovery because it differs from that of animals. We have identified two interesting target
proteins in the parasites that are important for their energy generation and survival in the human host; these are
the trypanosomal alternative oxidase (TAO) and glycerol kinase (TGK). However, both enzymes must be
simultaneously blocked in order to effectively kill the parasites and cure the infection. TAO is absent in humans;
although TGK is present, the structure revealed that some functional regions are very different from GK of other
organisms, providing encouraging preliminary data towards successful development of TGK-specific inhibitor(s).
The co-administration of TGK and TAO inhibitors will selectively kill the parasite and likely avoiding toxicity issues.
One of the innovations in our proposal is that we aim to design single inhibitors that co-target TAO and TGK.
This will avoid the chances of drug-drug interaction versus undesirable side effect that readily accompanies
administration of multiple drugs to treat a disease. This will be achieved by experimental screening of the 100,000
compounds in the Libraries of Small Molecule Repository of Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical
Sciences (SSPPS), University of California San Diego (UCSD), USA against the enzymatic activities of TGK and
TAO and then selecting those displaying inhibitory capability against both enzymes. In parallel, the compounds
will also be screened against the parasite for identifying those with trypanosomes killing effects. Both category
of compounds will then be optimized for killing the trypanosomes in culture, for inhibition of TAO and TGK, and
for lack of effects on human glycerol kinase and cultured human cells. Overall, the present proposal will lead to
the design single non-toxic and effective trypanocidal compound(s). The PI, Emmanuel O. Balogun, PhD, will
collaborate on this project with a team of multidisciplinary experts in USA and Nigeria: at SSPPS UCSD
Professors James H. McKerrow (USA Lead Mentor), Larissa Podust and Jair Siqueira-Neto (USA Co-Mentors);
Professors Mamman Mohammed (Nigeria Lead Mentor), Christian Happi, Maryam Aminu, and Mohammed N
Shuaibu (Nigeria Co-Mentors)."

10919877,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
While our own extensive studies have confirmed the significant role of the disrupted genome in Multiple
Myeloma (MM), they have also re-emphasized the gaps in understanding, and the importance of immune
regulation and gene-environment interaction. It is indeed likely that the evolution of MM, both before or during
therapy, is the result of a complex interplay of biological perturbations driven by genetic changes and
environmental influences. Our past work has also demonstrated that studying small numbers of patients at
great depth can be as rewarding for scientific understanding as studies of superficial genomic events in
thousands of patients. Thus we will strive to generate the first, longitudinal, translational clinical trial and
comprehensive data resource of environmental genetic interactions for the highest-risk MM population. It is
these patients who continue to rapidly fail highly effective therapeutics for reasons which are still completely
opaque. New and bold approaches using state-of-the-art technology are required to reverse this decades-old
lack of progress.
Our hypothesis is that analysis of data capturing gene-environment interactions at high resolution will reveal
insights into biological pathways influencing MM responsiveness to therapy and subsequent outcomes. First,
we will leverage a carefully studied and homogeneously treated high-risk group of “double hit” patients in a
Phase 2 clinical trial with large control clinical databases and bio-repositories to derive, for each patient, a
detailed map of environmental gene interactions linked to clinical outcome over time. Second, we will perform a
series of complex analyses to identify MM-associated changes in and across the genome, transcriptome,
epigenome, immune environment, proteome, lipidome and metabolome. Third, we will study these samples at
the highest resolution technically feasible today, and seek to define gene-environment interaction changes
over time that associate with response to therapy. Finally, high resolution data capturing these interaction
changes and clinical response data will be linked to improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying
MM variability among patients in regards to disease outcomes. This comprehensive resource will enable a
more individualized approach to clinical surveillance and therapy for MM."

This competitive renewal for 5 R01 NS034239 now in its 27th year provides a research plan reflecting the National
Institutes of Health strategic plan for HIV and HIV-related research. The plan lists neurologic complications as a
primary study need. The current study seeks to investigate the interplay between aging, HIV-1 infection, and
neurodegenerative diseases. The preliminary data now offered targets a significant need in biomedical research
for neuroHIV. That need is the discovery and characterization of a viable animal models that would mimic the
neuropathobiology of HIV-1 infection in the setting of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). It was previously not possible to
study a dynamic interplay between viral infection of CD4+ T cell subsets, immunity, antiretroviral therapy (ART),
and AD. We solved that problem as during the last grant cycle we created the needed model. Herein, we provide
extensive data of its utility, have outlined viable experimental approaches, and affirm its significance to provide
significant new insights into better understanding disease mechanisms and potential therapeutics that can be
realized during the 28th to the 33rd year of the project. The proposed work rests on a sound research foundation
by building on fundamental research findings made during the prior granting cycle. During that time we showed
that amyloid β (Aβ)-specific helper T cell type-1 (Th1) and -17 (Th17) effector T cell (Teff) clones propel
neurotoxic innate neuroinflammatory responses, proteinopathy, and neuronal dysfunction that were associated
with cognitive impairment in amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice. Moreover, through parallel studies, we
demonstrated that regulatory T cells (Treg) attenuate neuroinflammation and AD neuropathology, then restore
cognitive function. With our novel AD humanized mice in hand, we now show that during HIV-1 infection we not
simply see increases in neuroinflammation but that viral immune response can facilitates proteinopathy. We are
now able to conduct studies of HIV-1 compartmentalization, virus-amyloid adaptive and innate immunity
alterations, and consequences of immune-pathogenic and regulatory events. These can serve both to accelerate
or ameliorate AD processes. The aims of the proposal will be to fully characterize the model at the cell, immune,
tissue, and disease level by studies of innate macrophage-microglia and adaptive CD4+ Teffs pro-inflammatory
factors known to affect the brain’s microenvironment. The second component will assess immune transformation
by a spectrum of therapeutic agents that include antiretroviral therapy. We will now directly interrogate how T
cell immunity drives the tempo of both HIV/AIDS in the setting of neurodegenerative disease. Finally, Tregs that
are engineered to recognize Aβ by a transgenic T cell receptor (TCR) or a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), will
be employed as “future” therapeutic strategies to restore brain homeostasis, reduce plaque burden, and affect
neuroprotective outcomes. Overall, we are, now in a position to investigate chronic HIV-1 infection in the setting
of progressive AD and can study its relationship to immunity and ART with this new small animal models in hand."
10879145,"Project Summary
 In addition to motor control and learning, the cerebellum is intimately linked to cognition. This project is
designed to closely examine the cerebellum's role in nonmotor domains, namely, reinforcement learning and
statistical learning. We hypothesize that the structure's core computations for sensorimotor learning can be
generalized to nonmotor contexts. It is critical to understand how the cerebellum contributes to nonmotor learning
– this knowledge will support the development of novel mechanistic and clinical insights into cerebellar function,
and human learning in general.
 Foundational theoretical work has described how the cerebellum typifies an ideal substrate for supervised
motor learning. This theory made testable empirical predictions that have been borne out in experiments in
animals using tasks such as Pavlovian eyeblink conditioning and vestibular-ocular reflex adaptation, revealing
facts about cerebellar sensorimotor processes in exquisite detail. But what about a cerebellar role in other task
domains? Here we address this question. The proposed work integrates behavioral, neuroimaging, and
computational techniques to develop a new framework for generalized cerebellar learning computations.
 The research plan centers on three Specific Aims. In Aim 1 we use computationally guided functional
neuroimaging (fMRI) to examine the role of the cerebellum in reinforcement learning. We test the idea that the
cerebellum processes reward predictions and prediction errors, the core computations of reinforcement learning.
We also posit a constraint on cerebellar learning computations, namely that the structure only contributes to
learning when the temporal interval between events is brief (i.e., subsecond). Aim 2 takes a similar approach to
the domain of visual statistical learning, examining sensory predictions and prediction errors in the cerebellum
and further testing the proposed timing constraint. In Aims 1-2 we also measure cerebro-cerebellar connectivity
to position the cerebellum within broader task-specific learning networks, and to ask if cerebro-cerebellar
connectivity covaries with behavior. In Aim 3 we examine causal contributions of the cerebellum to nonmotor
learning, testing a large sample of individuals with cerebellar pathology and contrasting their behavior with
matched controls. Computational analyses will be used to detect and characterize the hypothesized deficits. This
project proposes a new framework for understanding the contributions of the cerebellum to nonmotor learning
and will provide new insight into the broader role of the cerebellum in health and disease."
10908680,"The Oklahoma Shared Clinical and Translational Resources (OSCTR) serves as the central nexus for clinical
and translational research (CTR) in Oklahoma, primarily focusing on addressing the most pressing health
issues of Oklahoma and other IDeA states, particularly health equity. The OSCTR will accomplish this mission
by providing CTR training and infrastructure, helping junior investigators establish independent CTR careers,
and expanding opportunities for community participation in clinical research and trials. The OSCTR activities
span more than 30 entities, including academic health centers, major universities, non-profit research
institutions, public health, tribal nations, and community organizations. The OSCTR is governed and managed
through this Core. The Program Director, Program Coordinator, Executive Committee, Steering Committee,
and Internal and External Advisory Committees provide strategic plans, policies, procedures, and oversight to
achieve the overall mission and goals of the OSCTR. These leaders allocate OSCTR resource use, prioritizing
research addressing prominent health issues in Oklahoma, such as cancer, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular
disease, mental health, substance abuse, arthritis and autoimmunity, child health, and positive health choices.
Through meetings, annual conferences, workshops, seminars, webinars, and teleconferences, leadership
decisions are communicated with OSCTR partners, investigators, scholars, and NIGMS program staff. The
Administrative Core will manage the Gateway to Research in Oklahoma (GRO), a new unified portal where
researchers, healthcare professionals, and patients can become involved with CTR in Oklahoma. GRO
consolidates and expands several OSCTR activities and resources for investigators, including a research
navigator service, CTR fact sheets and tutorials, access to OSCTR Core resources, and a powerful web-based
research networking application (PROFILES). For clinicians, GRO provides tools for understanding the clinical
research process, discussing clinical research with patients, and implementing evidence-based practices. For
patients, GRO introduces research participation and shares stories of CTR at OSCTR partner institutions. The
Administrative Core will continue to foster collaborations with other IDeA programs in Oklahoma to help
leverage NIH investments in the state. It also will help lead efforts to build on the recent successes of cross-
state IDeA-CTR collaborations that can address other shared health concerns. Scientific communications
personnel will provide lay summaries to stakeholder communities. Finally, this Core houses the OSCTR
Scientific Writing Unit (SWU), formed in response to stakeholder input to foster the productivity and funding
success of OSCTR Scholars and Pilot recipients by providing training, writing assistance, and consultation on
developing publications and grant applications. To help facilitate a sustainable impact on CTR in Oklahoma,
the proposal development office will aid tribal nations and community partners in building their capacity to
develop competitive center, collaborative, and infrastructure grants to synergize with the OSCTR mission."
10908698,"The Community Engagement and Outreach (CEO) Core seeks to sustain and grow collaborative research
addressing health equity in Oklahoma by directly involving communities, patients, and providers. A range of
underlying health issues affects the tribal and rural populations in the state that contribute to Oklahoma’s
burden of chronic illness. Nearly all communities in the state have high rates of diseases, including diabetes,
heart disease, rheumatologic disease, and cancer, as well as poor indicators of future health, including obesity,
substance abuse, low rates of health screening, and other unhealthy choices. As an original core in the
Oklahoma Shared Clinical and Translational Resources (OSCTR), the CEO Core has successfully built
relationships and collaborations, resulting in major statewide or community-oriented approaches to address
these health issues. The core has supported two practice-based research networks and established the
Oklahoma Primary Healthcare Improvement Cooperative (OPHIC) to provide test beds for primary care and
pediatrics clinical and translational efforts to disseminate and implement research findings that improve
healthcare delivery and health outcomes. The Core has supported the growth of research capacity and
activities in tribal communities through the highly successful Tribal Engagement Unit and our unique
partnerships. The Core will continue to work closely with its primary community partners, including the
Southern Plains Tribal Health Board, which represents 38 federal tribes in the state and 55 tribal/IHS health
facilities, the Cherokee and Chickasaw Nations, and OPHIC. In this renewal, the Public Health Institute of
Oklahoma will become an additional primary partner to build on the recent successes of community-engaged
research to address the pandemic. Together, these partnerships allow us to broaden existing activities and
support infrastructure for community engagement efforts in rural, tribal, and other underserved populations.
The CEO Core is establishing a new activity with this renewal that will utilize the community engagement
studio model to help investigators improve engagement with communities and help our institutions identify
barriers to effective engagement, as well as better align research and community priorities. The CEO Core
activities are critical for sustained stakeholder engagement that allows our researchers to gather information
from our communities, explore community research needs, protect communities from research risks unique to
minority populations, resolve impediments to research efforts, and complete effective research projects. The
CEO Core will continue to strengthen relationships between OSCTR partners that allow for durable and
meaningful collaborations to address the primary health concerns in our communities and will develop and
support infrastructure that increases research capacity within community partners."

 Cells alter their gene expression landscape to change their cellular state. The ability of cells to quickly
transit between cell states is essential for many processes in biology—from development to wound healing and
regeneration, processes which often go awry in pathological conditions like cancer or fibrosis. Thus, there is a
biomedical need to understand the basic mechanisms driving these rapid cellular transitions. The epithelial-
mesenchymal transition (EMT) is one such cellular transition that has reiterative roles in human health and
disease. While much is known about the transcriptional programs that promote EMT, there are additional levels
of gene expression control that impact cell state transitions and by extension EMT. The role of post-
transcriptional regulation, and how it drives and contributes to a spectrum of EMT states, is not well
understood. Here, we examine the role of post-transcriptional regulation, with emphasis on transcript turnover,
during EMT. Neural crest cells undergo a tightly regulated EMT and offer a tractable model system in which to
investigate the basic mechanisms of RNA turnover during EMT.
 We hypothesize that, in addition to pro-EMT transcriptional activation, transcripts that inhibit EMT (anti-
EMT) or serve to maintain a previous cellular state must be degraded to drive EMT and cell state transitions.
Using neural crest EMT as a model system, we seek to test this hypothesis by answering the following
questions: 1) How are anti-EMT and residual transcripts targeted for turnover; and 2) What are the targets of
RNA turnover during EMT and how does specific RNA turnover contribute to hybrid EMT states? To answer
these questions, we will: 1) Apply a combination of unbiased multi-omic and candidate gene approaches to
identify the RNA-binding proteins that promote RNA turnover during EMT; and 2) Apply RNA-sequencing
approaches to broadly identify the targets of RNA turnover, the mechanism of how they are turned over, and
how this contributes to hybrid EMT states.
 This Proposal seeks to understand the mechanisms of RNA turnover during EMT. The results of these
studies will greatly advance current understanding of the basic cellular mechanisms driving EMT, providing
novel targets for modulating EMT in human health and disease."
10912597,"A predoctoral T32 training program is proposed to augment the research workforce in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD),
related dementias (RD) and other neurodegenerative disorders (ND). The training initiative is named the South
Texas Alzheimer’s and Neurodegenerative Disorders Training Program: STAND TP. STAND TP is hosted by
UT Health San Antonio (UTHSA), a Hispanic Serving Institution which plays a dominant role in health-care
delivery to the residents of San Antonio and greater South Texas, the majority of whom are Hispanic. The overall
goal of the STAND TP is to develop a diverse, computationally sophisticated, translational and cross-disciplinary
research workforce to become leaders and members of cross-disciplinary research programs in AD, RD and
ND. Modern medical science is team based and translational, with a workflow spanning orders of bioscale from
genetics and molecular biology to systems physiology and health-care delivery. In the neurosciences, computer-
based methods – including imaging, genetics, multi-omics and epidemiology – have become fundamental to the
discovery process at preclinical and clinical levels, being used both as investigative tools and as biomarkers for
staging study participants and as surrogate outcomes for assessing treatment efficacy. In tandem, computational
approaches to image analytics have expanded in power and scope of application with the rapidly increasing
availability of high-performance computer clusters and cloud computing. The future AD/RD/ND workforce needs
expertise in all of these domains. To achieve the envisioned scope of expertise, STAND TP draws from four,
well-established, PhD-granting programs: Integrated Biomedical Sciences (IBMS), Radiological Sciences
(RADI), Biomedical Engineering (BME), and Translational Sciences (TS). Collectively, these four, thematically
diverse programs enroll 40-50 doctoral-degree trainees per year, eight of whom are MD/PhD trainees from our
T32-funded Medical Scientist Training Program. From this 4-program pool, STAND TP will recruit post-
candidacy, pre-doctoral students who propose dissertation research topics in AD, RD or ND. Eligible applicants
must be mentored by faculty investigators with expertise in AD/RD/ND and who have adequate funding to
support the proposed research. The UTHSA AD/RD/ND research community is large and well-funded,
commensurate with a longstanding, stable portfolio of NIH/NIA funding. UTHSA hosts three NIA P30 awards: an
Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, a Nathan Shock Center, and a Pepper Center. Most P30-affiliated faculty
have individual awards from NIA and other NIH institutes. Beyond the scope of each doctoral program, STAND
TP mandates cross-disciplinary training including: coursework; a cross-disciplinary research experience via an
innovative Core Clerkship program; and, scientific congress attendance. Training resources in the responsible
conduct of research (RCR) and in methods to enhance scientific rigor and reproducibility (R&R) are well
developed and mature. STAND TP is administrated by two PD/PIs, both of whom are ADRC core leaders,
experienced training grant administers, and highly successful investigators and mentors."
10891533,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Posttranslational modification (PTM) of nucleosome-associated histone proteins, along with histone variant
incorporation, influences transcriptional competence and their dysregulation has been identified in numerous
pathological states. Histone H3 N-terminal acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation are common PTMs; the
precise combination of these PTMs can modulate chromatin architecture and genome organization, leading to
changes in gene expression. Despite extensive efforts to characterize H3 PTMs and H3 variants, their
mechanistic and functional interplay, and their ability to influence biological output, it remains unclear how
histones and many histone PTMs integrate cues from upstream signaling cascades to regulate gene expression.
The overarching objective for my laboratory is to define mechanisms that regulate histone PTM patterns and
unmask how they influence transcriptional output. Over the next five years, we propose a combinatorial approach
leveraging genetic, molecular, cellular, biochemical and computational methods to define novel mechanisms by
which a poorly understood histone H3 PTM, H3 threonine 45 phosphorylation (pH3T45), relays cellular signals
from upstream kinases to impact gene expression, and leverage this approach to delineate how novel pathogenic
histone H3 variants dysregulate the epigenome to alter cellular function. Our preliminary data suggest that H3T45
phosphorylation status (1) modulates H3K4 methylation by directing specific H3K4-modifying complexes to
chromatin; (2) disrupts H3K36me3 via competing histone acetylation/deacetylation; (3) regulates RNA
processing through differential association with splicing factors and the RNA exosome complex. We will dissect
how H3K4-methyltransferase complexes differ in structure, function, and biological output when associated with
pH3T45 or unmodified H3T45. We will delineate how pH3T45 impacts the dynamics of H3K36 acetylation and
H3K36 methylation in the context of DNA repair. We will then define how pH3T45 governs the production of
mature RNA by examining the role of unmodified H3T45 and pH3T45 throughout RNA processing. Lastly, we
have identified a series of cancer-associated H3 variants in which an amino acid is changed to a lysine, termed
“H3 X to K” variants. Our preliminary data demonstrates that H3 X to K variants dysregulate proximal H3 PTMs
to uniquely modulate gene expression. We will leverage our experience studying pH3T45 to mechanistically
define how H3 X to K variants reprogram the epigenome to produce transcriptional and functional cellular
changes. This research will address the regulation and effects of histone PTM patterns and H3 variant
expression, which will inform our view of how H3 PTMs and variant expression underlies human disease."
10896975,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Many species have evolved traits that are adaptive in specific environmental contexts but would be considered
pathological in humans or in closely related lineages. In Antarctic fishes alone there has been an evolved loss
of red blood cells (anemia), low skeletal density (osteopenia), accumulation of triglycerides (metabolic disease),
loss of the glomerulus (kidney disease) and enlargement of the heart (cardiomegaly). How do these traits evolve,
and how to species overcome the deleterious trade-offs associated with these phenotypic extremes? To
complement traditional forward and population genetic approaches at identifying disease modifiers, my
laboratory has been developing tools and resources for analysis of natural variation across species rich datasets.
These tools allow us to track the patterns of protein coding and gene regulatory evolution across a phylogeny to
assess the genomic and macroevolutionary trends that precede and follow specific instances of trait evolution.
Over the next five years, we will apply these resources to focus on two main research areas: 1) identification of
genetic mechanisms underlying the evolution and development of disease-relevant traits and 2) discovery of the
molecular mechanisms underlying tissue plasticity in organs that experience seasonal atrophy and rejuvenation.
My lab will focus on a suite of convergently evolved traits that have repeatedly appeared in taxonomically
divergent fish lineages, including reduced skeletal density, increased corporeal lipid content, and the dynamic
seasonal atrophy of the glomerulus in the kidney. To approach these questions, we will integrate comparative
omic approaches in natural systems with the experimental modeling of our findings in the zebrafish. We seek to
assess the fundamental genomic basis of trait evolution and disease resilience, including the impact of protein
coding and gene regulatory variants, biased patterns of variation across the genome, contributions of gene flow,
and the influence of historical contingency on trait evolution. Additionally, we will integrate comparative genomic
analyses with case studies tissue plasticity at single cell resolution to isolate the molecular mechanisms by which
tissue structure and function adapts to changes in the environment. Together, this research program will discover
the phylogenomic origins of extreme traits, identify gene by environment interactions modifying trait presentation,
will explore organismal resilience to pathology."
10890096,"Depression is a devastating public health problem, yet the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying distinct
aspects of the disorder remain largely unknown. Convergent evidence from animal and human studies have
strongly implicated functional perturbations in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) in depression.
However, it is not known how dysfunction within specific sub-circuits of this heterogenous structure map to
specific depression-related symptom domains. This gap in knowledge concerning the pathophysiology of
depression is a major impediment to the advancement of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to this disabling
disorder. To address this gap, we propose a rigorous translational neuroscience study to define the distinct
circuit-specific mechanisms of anhedonia and anxiety in humans with depression, building upon work in non-
human primates, and converging human evidence from our laboratories. In marmosets, selective over-activation
of Brodmann Area 25 (BA25) within the sgACC via glutamate re-uptake inhibition causally leads to deficits in
anticipatory arousal – an established analogue of anhedonia in humans. Critically, these behavioral deficits are
selectively reversed by peripheral administration of the glutamate NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine. Pilot
work from our laboratory show a remarkable degree of inter-species convergence, pointing towards conservation
of a glutamate-sensitive sub-circuit within the sgACC/BA25 that controls hedonic responses to environmental
stimuli. We show that the sgACC/BA25 is specifically overactive in response to positive (but not negative)
incentives in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) compared to unaffected health control (HC)
individuals. We also show that the magnitude of activation specifically within BA25 (but not more rostral prelimbic
area 32 [PL32]) is positively associated with degree of self-reported anhedonia, as predicted by primate work.
Finally, we show that a single intravenous infusion of ketamine specifically reverses overactivation of the BA25
to positive stimuli; the degree of reduction in BA25 following ketamine correlated with improved in self-reported
anhedonia (but not anxiety), as predicted by primate work. The overall goal of the proposed work is to define the
distinct circuit-specific mechanisms of anhedonia and anxiety in humans with depression. To complete Aim 1,
we will enroll N=60 medication-free adults with MDD and N=60 HC adults. All individuals will undergo clinical
and behavioral assessment of anhedonia, anxiety, and other depression-relevant domains and both resting-state
and task-based acquisitions with a validated reward task using ultra-high-field 7-Tesla (7T) MRI. To complete
Aim 2, the N=60 medication-free adults with MDD from Aim 1 will be randomized to either a single IV infusion of
0.5 mg/kg racemic ketamine (KET) or placebo (PBO, saline) and undergo repeated clinical and behavioral
assessments and 7T MRI at 24 hours post treatment. To complete Aim 3, all MDD participants from Aim 2 will
undergo follow up clinical and behavioral assessments and 7T MRI at 7 days post-treatment. Participants will
complete mobile digital health measures over the 7-day follow up time, and for a total of 4 weeks from dosing."
10928742,"Project Summary/Abstract
An important goal in biology is to link genotype with phenotype for traits that affect fitness. The unique
adaptations found in animals that sequester neurotoxins are a useful model for understanding the genetic
underpinnings of simple and complex traits that are relevant to human medicine. Specifically, neurotoxins target
ion channel proteins that are critical for nervous system function. In humans, mutations in single ion channel
genes can cause diseases such as epilepsy, myotonia, cystic fibrosis, migraines, and diabetes. However, animals
often resist neurotoxins through mutations in these same ion channels, usually without suffering from disease
phenotypes. Understanding how diverse organisms fine tune the function of ion channels without causing disease
provides important information regarding the genetics of ion channel function and disease. Animals that not only
resist but also sequester toxins likely modulate multi-gene pathways underlying toxin metabolism and transport,
ultimately leading to selective toxin accumulation into specific tissues at high concentrations. The few known
genes involved in toxin sequestration also play critical roles in drug resistance (e.g., multi-drug transporters) and
metabolism (cytochrome p450s) in humans. Thus, resistance and sequestration mechanisms parallel
pharmaceutical goals to efficiently deliver drugs to specific targets and/or tissues while avoiding drug breakdown
or insensitivity. The proposed research aims to further our understanding of the genetic basis of toxin resistance
(simple) and sequestration (complex) mechanisms by leveraging state-of-the-art approaches in model and non-
model systems. In amphibians, tetrodotoxin resistance has been traced to mutations in ion channels, and
tetrodotoxin is thought to be sequestered from symbiotic bacteria. The proposed research will determine whether
Harlequin toads obtain toxins from bacteria through bacterial culturing and inoculation experiments. Researchers
will then use transcriptome sequencing to determine whether Harlequin toads and Pacific newts modulate
production and storage of TTX through specific protein activity in skin tissue. In another project, researchers will
identify genes and pathways involved in epibatidine sequestration using toxin-feeding experiments, RNA
sequencing, and whole-genome sequencing in poison frogs that can and cannot sequester epibatidine. Finally,
researchers will experimentally evolve nicotine sequestration in fruit flies to identify genes and pathways
underlying toxin sequestration with unprecedented detail. Understanding the mechanisms used by animals to
modulate toxin accumulation and clearance will provide insight into the suite of genes that interact with toxins as
they are ingested, transported, stored, or excreted. Given that neurotoxins target critical nervous system proteins
and interact with several biological pathways targeted by human medicine, the proposed research has translational
implications for pharmacology and the biology of disease."
10896972,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The human gut microbiome is intimately connected with health, with disruptions of its ecological composition
associated with numerous diseases. Manipulations of the microbiome via fecal microbiome transplants (FMTs),
in which microbial strains derived from healthy donor stool are introduced to a patient's gut community, have
been found to be effective treatments for certain diseases, but less effective for others. In several cases in
which FMTs fail to resolve a disease, invading strains fail to colonize, but it is unknown why, and even when
strains do colonize, a healthy clinical outcome still is not guaranteed. Experimental evolution studies in mouse
and bee microbiomes have shown that strains invading a host rapidly adapt, enabling colonization via physical
adherence to host cells, competition with resident strains, and evasion of the host immune system. Despite this
strong experimental support for the importance of adaptation during colonization, its role in the human gut
microbiome has received little attention. Recently, we and others found that microbiome can evolve rapidly on
months and even days, but the impacts of this rapid pace of evolution on the colonization process remains
unknown. The main roadblock to linking adaptation and colonization lies in the statistical challenges of
quantifying the full landscape of adaptations from noisy metagenomic data. Here I propose to develop new
statistical methods that elucidate the evolutionary processes relevant for colonization in the
microbiome and apply them to one of the largest datasets of FMT recipients.
My lab's main goal is to understand how microbiomes evolve in a range of contexts and timescales. To this
end, the overarching objective of my proposed MIRA research program is to elucidate the evolutionary
processes that permit colonization of a strain. To fully quantify the mode, tempo, and targets of evolution in the
gut microbiome and their relevance to colonization, we will develop novel methodology capable of detecting
evolutionary events that are undetectable presently, including evolutionary changes (1) arising within hosts on
short timescales and (2) across hosts on longer time scales. To illustrate the potential of our statistical
innovations, we will study FMT recipients given that the identities of invading versus resident strains can be
easily distinguished. However, FMTs represent an example of a more general phenomenon of colonization
relevant to a range of cohorts and questions that my lab is studying, including the role of evolution in infants
experiencing an influx of microbes at birth, strain turnover during consumption of antibiotics and probiotics, and
spatial segregation of evolutionary adaptations needed for colonization along the gut. In sum, successful
completion of this work will not only generate statistical innovations needed to quantify evolution in the
microbiome, but also elucidate the importance of evolution in colonization, knowledge that promises to yield
more efficacious microbiome therapies."

This is a renewal application of a training program in its 15th year that seeks funding to support the same
number of predoctoral (5) and postdoctoral (3) research trainees as in the prior cycle, in a multidisciplinary
research program in cardiovascular and vascular diseases, spanning from molecular and cellular studies,
multimodal imaging, biomedical engineering, to translational science. During the last funding cycle, we have
been highly successful in expanding our training program from 40 faculty five years ago to 45 faculty in this
competing renewal. The faculty in our Training Program are from five different schools/Colleges. Indeed, the
training program has had a highly synergistic impact on our institution; we have been successful in establishing
a new Cardiovascular Research Institute (CVRI) through institutional funding from five different schools and
colleges at UC Davis, which was launched in the Fall of 2017. The curriculum and activities developed within
the training program have served as models for other training programs in translational research on campus
and hence, serve a wider group of trainees at UC Davis.
The Program operates under the auspices of the Department of Internal Medicine and the Graduate Studies in
Molecular, Cellular and Integrative Physiology (MCIP), Pharmacology and Toxicology (PTX), Biochemistry,
Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology (BMCDB), Biophysics (BPH), Biomedical Engineering (BME),
and Applied Mathematics (APM), a truly multidisciplinary program. The goal is to produce a new blend of
scientists who are poised to exchange ideas, expertise, and techniques, leading to the direct and effective flow
and translation of basic science discoveries into clinical testing and applications, as well as generate
mechanistic hypotheses that can be tested at the basic cellular level, directly derived from clinical research.
The advantages of such an integrated program are vast and far-reaching. By merging basic, translational, and
clinical trainees, our objective is to produce scientists, who are not only capable of establishing independent
research, but are also adept at recognizing and integrating relevant, basic science questions/problems into
clinically germane answers and solutions, and vice versa."
10914944,"Project Summary
Ventricular arrhythmia is the leading cause of death for chronic heart failure (CHF) patients. Although the
therapeutic potential of renal denervation (RDN) for ventricular arrhythmias has been reported extensively, RDN-
induced adverse complications severely limit its use in the clinic. Our recent study revealed that macrophage
expansion and neuroinflammation in the stellate ganglion (SG) contribute to CHF-increased cell excitability of
cardiac sympathetic postganglionic (CSP) neurons, which subsequently promotes cardiac sympathetic
overactivation and ventricular arrhythmogenesis in CHF rats. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(GM-CSF) is a crucial mediator in macrophage activation. Our pilot data showed that RDN attenuates cardiac
sympathetic overactivation and ventricular arrhythmias, which are accompanied by the marked reduction of GM-
CSF level and macrophage activation in SGs in CHF rats. However, it remains unclear if the antiarrhythmic effect
of RDN is achieved via attenuating GM-CSF-mediated inflammatory pathways in SGs in CHF. Following the
discovery of the antiarrhythmic mechanisms of RDN, this proposal aims to develop a novel clinical intervention
to achieve the therapeutic role of RDN and avoid its limitations. Since sympathetic innervation of the kidney
originates primarily from neurons in the aorticorenal ganglion (ARG), targeting ARG neurons could be a logical
therapeutic strategy for achieving the antiarrhythmic role of RDN. Considering the advantages of optogenetics,
including rapid, specific control of neuronal activities by light-sensitive opsins, adeno-associated-virus-
Archaerhodopsin (ArchT, an inhibitory light-sensitive opsin) gene will be transfected into ARG neurons in CHF
rats. Specificity of neuronal expression of ArchT in ARG neurons will be achieved by linking a neuron-specific
promoter to the ArchT gene. Continual optogenetic silencing in ARG neurons will be achieved by illuminating a
LED probe that is controlled and powered wirelessly in freely moving animals. We hypothesize that optogenetic
inhibition of ARG neurons would reduce CHF-elevated GM-CSF level in SGs, which subsequently alleviates
macrophage activation and neuroinflammation in SGs, thereby attenuating CSP neuronal excitability, cardiac
sympathetic overactivation, and ventricular arrhythmogenesis in CHF. Using multi-faceted technical approaches
ranging from whole-animals to cellular-molecular levels, we will design in vivo and in vitro studies to assess these
questions. Specific Aim 1, we will test if GM-CSF signaling axis contributes to macrophage activation and
neuroinflammation in SGs from CHF animals. Specific Aim 2, we will address if GM-CSF signaling pathway
contributes to CHF-increased cell excitability of CSP neurons, cardiac sympathetic overactivation, and
ventricular arrhythmogenesis. Specific Aim 3, we will determine if optogenetic silencing in ARGs can achieve
the antiarrhythmic effect of RDN by attenuating GM-CSF-induced macrophage activation and neuroinflammation
in SGs in CHF. These studies will open a new avenue in therapeutics against lethal ventricular arrhythmia and
provide a novel clinical intervention to reduce mortality and improve outcomes and quality of life in CHF patients."
10915530,"Project Summary
 Photon-driven processes have emerged as a powerful tool for achieving challenging bond cleavage and
bond formation. Photocatalysis offers the benefit of temporal and spatial control with low energy light, which has
been widely advantageous for efficiently building molecular complexity from simple starting materials. The
judicious choice of photocatalysts enables the precision of reactivity that is rarely achieved with other forms of
catalysis and heating. An underused area of photocatalysis is photothermal conversion. Irradiation of specific
nanoparticles or dyes with visible light creates intense thermal gradients in a photothermal conversion process.
In contrast to bulk heating, where the temperature remains uniform across a reaction medium, substrates would
only experience thermal energy within a few nanometers of excitation under temporal heating. Consequently,
this process would use irradiation to drive chemical processes at high temperatures with temporal and spatial
control. Spatial control enables the selective formation of highly reactive species without competing bimolecular
side reactions.
 The proposed research comprises three fundamental projects exploring the use of photothermal catalysis
to enable the synthesis of complex molecules using visible light irradiation. First, high-temperature thermal
rearrangements will be achieved using carbon-based nanoparticles and visible light irradiation under mild
conditions. This strategy will enable the synthesis of complex products without thermal decomposition generally
associated with bulk thermolysis. Additionally, the identification of various photothermal agents and synthetic
elaborations will generate more efficient catalysts. In the second project, photothermal heating will generate
carbon-centered radicals through C–C bond homolysis. Intercepting these highly reactive intermediates will forge
new C–C bonds in ring expansion reactions, in intramolecular cyclizations. Specific photothermal agent design
will enable intermolecular ring expansions to build molecular complexity. In a third project, the C–C bond
homolysis reactions identified in project two will be used in dynamic kinetic resolutions for atom economical
synthesis of enantioenriched pharmaceutical compounds. Emulsions will confine thermal gradients to within
micelles enabling the coupling of thermal epimerization reactions with highly selective enzymatic reactions.
Combined, these three projects will develop an understanding of photothermal catalysis and the effect of light
and intensity on generation of thermal gradients. A thorough understanding of how these thermal gradients can
be leveraged for high temperature reactions with the spatial and temporal control of visible light will enable new
synthetic bond disconnections previously unrealized."

Microbial cell populations can be highly heterogeneous, which is crucial for strain survival in complex
conditions such as antibiotic treatment. Apparently, the cell-to-cell heterogeneity cannot be revealed using
traditional bulk sequencing techniques. Single-cell based approaches for microbial cells are emerging to tackle
this question, however, the spatial context information, crucial for understanding the microbe-host interactions,
is not collected. As of current, we still lack high resolution spatial omics tools to study microbes and their
residing mammalian host. Most currently available NGS based spatial transcriptome platforms are not
compatible with bacteria profiling due to three reasons: 1) Bacteria cell walls are highly diverse in thickness
and composition, which prevents the reagents such as reverse transcriptase and primers to enter the cell,
especially for Gram Positive ones with thick cell walls; 2) mRNAs of bacteria cells are sparse and have short
half-life; 3) bacteria mRNA lacks poly-A tail in RNA sequence. During the past 5 years, I developed DBiT-seq
(Deterministic barcoding in tissue), the first high resolution spatial proteo-transcriptome platform, which have
been widely applied to neuroscience, development, and cancer studies in human. I further reported the
Spatial-CITE-seq technique which can co-mapping ~300 surface proteins and the whole transcriptome of
various tissue types. I propose in the next five years the development of a new spatial sequencing technology
called microDBiT, which will be the first spatial proteo-transcriptome platform that can map microbes and the
host cells within the spatial context. At the initial stage, we will design and use the slides of cultured Gram
positive bacteria S.aureus and negative bacteria E. coli as a model to optimize the key steps of microDBiT
protocol, including cell wall digestion, mRNA polyadenylation, reverse transcription and in cell ligation. We will
next develop the microDBiT protocol for microbe and host cell co-mapping using gut tissues obtained from
bacteria colonized germ-free C57BL/6 mice. Lastly, we will apply the microDBiT to map out the gene
expression profile of pathogens and the patient cells in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Since metabolites
of microbes are considered important pathways that influence the host cell behavior, we will meanwhile include
an antibody panel of host receptors and study how the metabolites will influence the gene expression of host
cells. This technique will ultimately enable high-throughput and high-resolution characterization of spatial
heterogeneity of microbes and their interaction with the host cells. In the long run, we will build microDBiT into
a comprehensive platform that could be applied to diverse microbe and host systems at different omics levels
(Genomics, Transcriptomics, Epigenomics, etc.)."

 T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are essential for germinal center (GC) responses and long-term
humoral immunity. However, the complex regulation that determines the differentiation of Tfh cells, in
particular, the initial CXCR5– versus CXCR5+ CD4+ T cell differentiation, the developmental progression
of CXCR5+CD4+ T cells to become GC-Tfh cells, and the generation of follicular helper-like memory
CD4+ T cells expressing CXCR5, are still not fully understood. Our proposal aims to fill in these
knowledge gaps with long-term goals to identify novel genes/pathways underlying the CD4+ T cell
differentiation.
 In our preliminary studies, we have discovered a novel network engaging various
factors/pathways that fine-tunes CXCR5+ versus CXCR5– CD4+ T cell differentiation and regulates the
generation of cytotoxic CD4+ T cells in the early stage of CD4+ T cell response. By combining RNA-seq,
ATAC-seq, and single cell RNA-seq, our preliminary data also suggest that the PD-1+CXCR5+ pre-Tfh
cells undergo substantial further differentiation to become PD-1hiCXCR5hi GC-Tfh cells. Additionally, we
have generated novel “fate-mapping” reporter mice that will allow us to track the varied CXCR5– and
CXCR5+ memory CD4+ T cells. Thus, in this application, we aim to dissect the molecular underpinning
of the early stage CXCR5+ versus CXCR5– CD4+ T cell differentiation as well as to elucidate the
mechanisms underlying the pre- to GC-Tfh differentiation and the generation of diversified CD4+ T cell
memory.
 Our work will have a profound impact on the field of CD4+ T cell differentiation. The research will
not only shed new light on our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the multiple steps of Tfh
cell differentiation but also establish new model systems for memory CD4+ T cell studies. This proposal
has the potential to provide important knowledge on how to control both the humoral and the cellular
arms of the CD4+ T cell response to aid vaccine development for new pandemic threats and help the
treatment of infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders."

T cell activation initiates a program of differentiation that generates a continuum of different memory T cell states
with diverse functional and molecular profiles. Activated T cells upregulate the inhibitory receptor programmed
cell death protein 1 (PD-1) to prevent excessive T cell inflammation, autoreactivity and tissue damage. Upon
binding to its ligands, PD-1 interferes with the phosphorylation cascade that modulates the quality and quantity
of T cell signaling. Cancers evade T cell recognition by engaging PD-1 and consequently PD-1 blocking
antibodies restore anti-tumor T cell responses and improve the survival of patients with various malignancies.
Unfortunately, the majority of cancer patients do not respond to PD-1 blockade and up to 30% develop
inflammatory toxicities highlighting the critical role of PD-1 in the maintenance of immune tolerance. Research
into basic PD-1 biology, together with the clinical picture of cancer patients treated with PD-1 blocking antibodies,
converge to emphasize that PD-1 engages complex signaling networks to support T cell homeostasis,
differentiation and immune responses. Therefore, elucidating the signaling cascades and molecular pathways
triggered by PD-1 are paramount to fundamental T cells biology and will lay the foundation for advancing the
development of PD-1 targeting therapies. Nevertheless, our knowledge as it pertains to the molecular programs
that support PD-1 inhibition in functionally diverse human T cell populations is limited. Furthermore, PD-1 has
two ligands with distinct tissues expression patterns and binding affinity, yet the functional consequences of
these differences are unknown. Our preliminary data highlight that PD-1 engages unique signaling cascades in
ligand specific-manner across the trajectory of naïve to memory differentiation, and that the molecular programs
underlying functional, phenotypic and developmental T cell heterogeneity also guide pathways of resistance to
PD-1 inhibition. Here we will leverage: (1) quantitative phosphoproteomics to reveal PD-1 ligand specific
phosphorylation cascades triggered in functionally distinct T cell populations; (2) functional immuno-assays in
combination with scRNA-seq and cellular barcoding to identify transcriptional regulators of PD-1 responsivity
across the trajectory of naïve through memory and effector T cell generation; and (3) functional genomics to
identify cellular and molecular mediators of resistance to PD-1 inhibition. Successful completion of this proposal
will reveal how functional T cell diversity shapes and guides PD-1 triggered cellular and molecular pathways and
their associated PD-1 ligand specific dependencies. Collectively, understanding the cellular and molecular
etiologies associated with PD-1 responsivity and the mechanisms driving T cell resistance to PD-1 inhibition will
further our understanding of the fundamental functions of this critical inhibitory receptor in immunological
tolerance and advance novel therapeutic directions targeting PD-1 with implications in cancer, infection and
autoimmunity."

The focus of research in the Taylor laboratory is on nuclear export in eukaryotic cells, which we study by
perturbing the normal function of the main exporter of proteins, XPO1 or Exportin-1. We use molecular biology,
genomics, proteomics, and mouse modeling to determine the mechanisms of XPO1-mediated nuclear export
function and the role of XPO1 in disease pathogenesis. We also study how XPO1 interacts with other proteins
and molecules such as ribonucleic acid (RNA). In the next five years, the goal of the lab is to define the role of
XPO1 in the nuclear export of RNA. The laboratory is currently pursuing the following projects. Defining the
molecular effects of wildtype and mutant XPO1 on gene expression, splicing, and translation. Given the known
role of XPO1 in the export of small nuclear RNA (snRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) via the binding of RNA
binding proteins, we hypothesize that alterations in XPO1 may impact RNA splicing and/or mRNA translation.
We have generated several genetically engineered models to allow endogenous expression of the XPO1
E571K or R749Q mutation, including conditional knockin mice. We have demonstrated through a variety of
proteomic, biochemical, structural, and molecular studies that XPO1 E571K affects recognition of its cargo’s
nuclear export signal (NES) and results specifically in altered export of of NFκB and NFAT transcription factor
proteins. The aim of my first project is to continue to study the extent of how the XPO1 E571K alters nuclear
export and to explore whether RNA export, and consequent mRNA splicing and translation, is affected through
the mislocalization of RNA binding proteins. We have recently discovered another mutation, XPO1 R749Q, that
affects nuclear export by increasing the export of proteins out of the nucleus. We plan to study which proteins
this affects and how this affects cell growth, cell cycle and other homeostatic processes. We are also modeling
overexpression of XPO1 and will compare how this overactive mutant compares to overexpression in relation
to protein and RNA export. Drugs that selectively inhibit XPO1 will allow us to isolate the effects of XPO1-
dependent export. Furthermore, our preliminary data show that cells with abnormal splicing due to SF3B1
mutations undergo apoptosis upon exposure to XPO1 inhibitors. We will also investigate the effects of XPO1
inhibition in mutant Sf3b1 expressing cells using genetically engineered cell lines and an Sf3b1 knockin mouse
model. We hypothesis that XPO1 inhibition perturbs RNA export and affects gene expression and mRNA
splicing given the known role of XPO1 to export small nuclear RNA via RNA-binding proteins. This work will
serve as foundational data for future grant submissions investigating the biology of XPO1 and its role in
nuclear export of RNA. The overarching goal of this research is aligned with the NIGMS’ mission to
support new basic discovery science that can eventually culminate in new medical therapies. By better
understanding the role of XPO1 in RNA export, we can better design therapies that modulate nuclear export or
RNA splicing for a wide range of diseases where RNA regulation may play a role."

Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias lead to marked declines in daily functioning, independence, and
quality of life. One of the earliest cognitive changes in these conditions is impairment in prospective memory,
or the ability to remember future intentions such as taking medications at a given time. Prior intervention
studies that targeted prospective memory used mnemonic strategies or cognitive training, but these
approaches resulted in modest gains in clinical populations. By contrast, our Stage I pilot trial indicated that
smartphone-based memory aids (reminder apps) can be used by persons with mild cognitive impairment and
mild dementia to improve both subjective and objective prospective memory performance. Having established
feasibility and acceptability in the Stage I pilot study, we will now test for efficacy, durability, and generalizability
of benefits across diverse samples in a Stage II randomized controlled trial. We will recruit 200 participants
with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, half of whom will be from digitally-disadvantaged backgrounds
(low socioeconomic status, rural, or historically underrepresented groups). These populations are well-
captured by our clinical catchment areas. Participants will complete baseline assessments and then be
randomly assigned to a smartphone reminder app intervention or an active control condition that uses a paper-
based memory support system. Across a 4-week intervention period, participants will complete both patient-
selected and experimenter-assigned prospective memory assessments and receive booster training sessions
to promote self-efficacy with the intervention/control system. We will assess durability of effects at 3-month and
6-month follow-up sessions. It is unknown whether smartphone-based or paper-based approaches will be
better at supporting prospective memory across 6 months in older adults with cognitive impairment and digital
disadvantages. However, based on pilot data, we anticipate that the reminder app will be especially beneficial
to prospective memory because it provides automated reminders, allows care partners to “push” reminders
and events, and it includes daily alerts to use the app. As a secondary aim, we will simultaneously enroll family
or friend study partners to collect informant ratings, track how much study partners assist the participants, and
determine whether improving prospective memory in patients improves quality of life in study partners (e.g., by
reducing the double to-do list burden of remembering for themselves and for care recipients). As a third aim,
we will integrate quantitative and qualitative data to identify barriers and facilitators to smartphone interventions
in digitally-disadvantaged individuals who have historically been underrepresented in technology and dementia
research. This research will advance understanding of technology usage in older adults, inform whether
smartphone-based reminder apps are effective and durable relative to established paper-based approaches for
prospective memory, and provide the foundation for personalized cognitive medicine interventions."
10919784,"Astroviruses are small, non-enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses (+ssRNA) that are prevalent
in bird and animal populations. Human astrovirus (HAstV) infection has historically been known as a leading
cause of non-bacterial gastroenteritis. However, in recent years, divergent HAstVs have been found in cases of
encephalitis. Despite their prevalence, there is limited information regarding the mechanisms of virus infection.
The virus is known to produce two nonstructural polyproteins required for infection, which are cleaved into
functional subunits by host signal peptidase and the virus-encoded serine protease (Pro). However, the specific
sites of Pro cleavage in the polyprotein have not been discovered. Thus, we do not know the specific sequences
of viral proteins, which has made it difficult to assign functions to these proteins. Similarly, lack of information
and tools has made studying virus-host interactions challenging. Thus, few host proteins that regulate HAstV
infection have been identified. Furthermore, like all +ssRNA viruses, HAstV infection leads to dramatic
remodeling of intracellular membranes to form replication organelles (ROs), which concentrate viral host factors
required for infection. However, the source of the membranes for these critical structures is not well understood.
Overall, there are major gaps in our knowledge of all aspects of HAstV biology and there is a need for tools that
will allow us to build a foundation to expand our research on fundamental mechanisms that regulate HAstV
infection. The goal of this proposal is to utilize tools we have developed for +ssRNA viruses and HAstV to
understand the mechanisms of (1) viral nonstructural polyprotein processing and Pro activity, (2) host protein
regulation of virus infection, and (3) viral protein manipulation of host organelles. We have made significant
progress to be well-suited to accomplish these proposed projects. We have developed a library of polyprotein
expression constructs and a cDNA infectious clone to investigate Pro-dependent cleavage. Additionally, we have
successfully developed a versatile viral protease activity reporter that has been shown to work for enteroviruses
and flaviviruses, which we will adapt for HAstV to study intracellular Pro activity. We have generated tools to
study the microenvironment of the viral nonstructural proteins in living cells and to perform a CRISPR screen for
pro- and anti-viral proteins. Lastly, we have innovative tools and strategies to visualize the manipulation of host
organelles upon viral protein expression or infection using long-term, time-lapse imaging of living cells. Overall,
the proposed projects are designed to significantly advance the field of cell biology of HAstV infection through
investigation of the molecular virology and virus-host interactions."
10908490,"Neurogenesis plays an important role in stroke recovery. In models of cerebral ischemia, neurogenesis is
amplified in the sub-ventricular zone (SVZ) and the sub-granular zone (SGZ). In addition to these responses in
the standard neurogenic niches, some reports suggest that parenchymal astrocytes may convert into neurons
after stroke. Within neurogenic niches in SVZ and SGZ, brain endothelial cells play a vital role by secreting
trophic factors to support neural stem cells. Is it possible that brain endothelium may also help regulate
astrocyte trans-differentiation? In this proposal, we will investigate this idea, i.e. brain endothelial cells act as
an unexpected source of signals to convert astrocytes into neurons, thus improving outcomes after stroke.
Our pilot data suggest that (i) oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-stimulated brain endothelial cells convert
astrocytes into neural progenitor cells (NPC) in vitro, (ii) transfer of microvesicles derived from OGD-stimulated
brain endothelial cultures reprogram astrocytes into NPC in vitro, (iii) microvesicles derived from OGD-
stimulated brain endothelial cells also convert astrocytes into NPC in vivo, and promote recovery in mouse
focal cerebral ischemia, (iv) pro-neural transcription factor Ascl1 in brain endothelial cells may be involved in
astrocyte trans-differentiation, (v) methods to dissect these mechanisms (mouse genetics, brain endothelial
cell-specific viral infection, lineage tracing, single-nuclei RNA-seq, imaging etc) are feasible in our labs.
Based on our pilot data, we hypothesize that up-regulation of Ascl1 in brain endothelial cell-derived
microvesicles induces astrocyte trans-differentiation, thus contributing to neurogenesis, tissue repair, and
recovery after stroke.
We have 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will compare effects of major neurovascular unit cells on astrocyte trans-
differentiation. In Aim 2, we will dissect mechanisms of brain endothelial cell-mediated astrocyte trans-
differentiation, and use gain- and loss-of-function experiments to manipulate Ascl1 expression in brain
endothelial cells, and track astrocyte trans-differentiation after focal ischemia. In Aim 3, we will investigate the
effect of microvesicles derived from Ascl1-overexpressed brain endothelial cells on astrocyte trans-
differentiation, and assess neurogenesis, tissue repair, and sensorimotor/cognitive outcomes in young, older,
male or female mice after focal ischemia. Our experiments will utilize mouse genetic and molecular tools
including a combination of AAV-induced brain endothelial cell-specific gene expression (Tie2-Cre or Cdh5-Cre
mice), lineage tracing of astrocytes by using tamoxifen-inducible Aldh1l1-CreERT2;R26R-YFP mice, scRNA-
seq or snRNA-seq to fully map transcriptomes of astrocytes in mice treated with microvesicles post stroke.
Translational relevance will be assessed with in vivo optical imaging and long-term outcomes post-stroke. This
project should define a new form of endothelial signaling in stroke, identify a unique vascular-regulated
mechanism of neuroplasticity, and hopefully may lead to novel therapeutic opportunities for brain repair."
10929990,"Project Summary
Alcohol use disorder (AUD), previously alcohol abuse and dependence, is a significant public health problem.
In the US, excessive alcohol use is responsible for 93,000 deaths and 2.7 million years of potential life lost, at
a cost of $250 billion annually. In 2012-13, the 12-month and life-time prevalence of AUD in US adults was
14% and 29%, respectively, increasing by more than 40% from a decade earlier. Since the Covid-19
pandemic, alcohol consumption has increased even more. Excessive alcohol consumption affects various
bodily organs, leading to many health consequences. Fortunately, AUD is more treatable than commonly
believed. Cognitive behavioral therapy, brief interventions, and motivational enhancement therapy are the most
widely studied behavioral interventions and are similarly efficacious, while Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is the
most sought out mutual support group. Pharmacotherapy can be combined with behavioral interventions to
increase success. However, treatments for AUD are underutilized. The misconception among patients and
physicians that treatment is ineffective is an important obstacle to use. Another is the common view that
treatment success requires total abstinence. In reality, recovery from AUD can include some heavy drinking,
and AUD treatment can be effective. Expressing treatment effectiveness into long-term health benefits could
help convince physicians to offer treatment and encourage patients to use it. However, randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) alone cannot provide this information because they do not measure long-term health outcomes,
nor do they compare all treatments head-to-head, making it difficult to choose among them. Simulation
modeling offers a comprehensive approach to comparing treatments, but none of existing AUD models were
designed to assess all treatments. We designed a decision aid (DA) describing treatment options, but it does
not yet include estimates of long-term benefits due to lack of such data at the time of development. Project
objective: To develop, validate, and apply a computer simulation model to inform policy makers, physicians,
and patients of the lifetime benefit of treatments for AUD. Aim 1: Develop and validate a microsimulation model
of the natural history of alcohol-associated complications accounting for the change in drinking behaviors and
AUD status over time. Aim 2: Assess the comparative effectiveness of AUD treatments. Aim 3: Incorporate
patient and provider feedback to assess the clarity, content, and acceptability of augmenting an existing DA
with comparative effectiveness data. Impact: Our model will offer a better understanding of the expected
benefit of AUD treatments and provide an innovative approach to decision modeling and treatment selection.
By incorporating long-term effectiveness data into an existing DA, our study will provide physicians and
patients with valuable evidence and a tool to support selection of optimal treatments, thereby helping to close
the treatment gap. Ultimately, our project will address NIAAA’s research missions while improving the quality of
life for tens of millions of US adults suffering from AUD."
10932183,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Androgen indifferent prostate cancers account for a large proportion of the disease lethality and have
limited therapy options, partly due to the lack of identifying biomarkers. To address the unmet need of
developing effective therapies for this subset, we defined the aggressive variant prostate cancers (AVPC)
criteria. Through a series of prospective trials and studies in mice, we showed that the AVPC criteria can enrich
for prostate cancers that respond poorly to androgen inhibition and benefit from adding carboplatin to
cabazitaxel. In recent trials we examined the contribution of PARP inhibitor maintenance, and of anti-PD1
inhibition to the chemotherapy backbone in men with AVPC. Early data show meaningful improvements in
outcomes with these additions, but many men with AVPC are still progressing rapidly. Our overall goal is to
arrive at rational, biologically-based combination therapies that effectively treat the AVPC.
 The analysis of samples from our trial participants, and preclinical studies, converge on altered arginine
metabolism as a key metabolic pathway in androgen-indifferent prostate cancer biology. We also found
evidence of argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1) silencing with platinum chemotherapy in AVPC cell lines
and patient samples. ASS1 deficiency renders cells dependent on extracellular arginine, and thus sensitive to
arginine depletion with agents such as PEGylated arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG20). ADI-PEG20 depletes
serum arginine levels, has activity in several malignancies (alone and in combination with chemotherapy), and
has immunomodulatory effects. However, the effects of serum arginine depletion on intratumoral metabolite
levels in patients are unknown, and its effects on the human immune tumor microenvironment (TME) remain
poorly understood. We hypothesize that the addition of ADI-PEG20 will improve the efficacy of
carboplatin+cabazitaxel by modifying intratumoral arginine metabolism and immune profiles in the
AVPC TME.
 In AIM 1, we will conduct a phase I/II dose escalation trial to identify the optimal dose (in terms of safety and
efficacy) of ADI-PEG20 to combine with carboplatin+cabazitaxel in men with AVPC. In AIM 2, peripheral blood
and metastatic tumor biopsies obtained from trial participants at baseline, after 1 and after 6 cycles of treatment,
and at parallel time-points in PDX and syngeneic mouse models, will be used to measure associations between:
(a) serum levels of arginine and citrulline, (b) intratumoral levels of arginine, (c) ASS1 expression, and (d) the
expression of other arginine metabolism enzymes, and (e) outcomes. In AIM 3 we will examine the effects of
treatment on immune profiles and immune cell distribution within the TME.
 Our studies will provide a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of serum arginine depletion on the immune
and non-immune AVPC TME, shed light on the mechanisms of synergy between ADI-PEG20 and cytotoxic
chemotherapy, and ultimately, serve to prioritize rational combinations for the treatment of the AVPC."
10913544,"Abstract:
Mitochondrial function underlies a broad spectrum of health and disease conditions that range from metabolic
rate regulation, thermogenesis, to inborn genetic disorders, cancer, aging, cardiac and muscle dysfunction,
diabetes and obesity. Using oxidative phosphorylation, the mitochondria pump protons from the matrix to the
intermembrane space to generate a proton gradient. The protons return to the matrix via the ATPase complex
to generate ATP that supports the life of the organism. About 20-50% of protons leak back to matrix but do not
drive ATP production and this is called proton leak or uncoupling. The traditional proton leak measurement by
Clark type oxygen probe and Seahorse assay use oxygen consumption rate (OCR) as a readout. These OCR
based proton leak measurements cannot exclude “proton slip”, which is defined as respiratory chain activity that
consumes O2 and transfers electrons without extruding protons out of the membrane. There is a knowledge gap
of how to assess the specific mitochondrial proton leak and slip. To address this gap, I established a direct
method for measuring the accurate proton leak and eliminating proton slip by exposing mitochondria to a pH
gradient stress in saponin permeabilized cells with mt-cpYFP, a mitochondrial targeted pH sensitive indicator.
The buffers lack metabolic substrates, thus making the cells energetically inactive, allowing separation of the
physical property of the mitochondrial inner membrane from energetically active processes such as ion pumping.
Using this approach, I have revealed that the adenine nucleotide transporter 1 (ANT1) has an under-appreciated
role in supporting an excessive proton leak. With this novel mitochondrial proton leak measuring method, in this
R35 MIRA proposal, we propose to 1) Compare mitochondrial proton leak between different cell types from the
mt-cpYFP transgenic mouse; 2) Dissect the molecular basis of ANT1-mediated mitochondrial proton leak; 3)
Screen for new drugs/compounds to prevent or augment the mitochondrial proton leak. Completion of this study
will provide key mechanisms of mitochondrial proton leak and will provide a novel group of drugs that modulate
mitochondrial function involved in the metabolic homeostasis of these diverse health processes."

The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth) School of Public Health seeks its
sixth renewal of our highly successful Cancer Control Research Training and Career Development Pro-
gram for doctoral students and postdoctoral trainees. The long-term goal of the proposed training pro-
gram is to reduce cancer morbidity and mortality and decrease cancer-related health inequities. The
training program objective is to increase the number of outstanding cancer control scientists - with an
emphasis on training scientists from underrepresented minority groups - in cutting edge research and
analytic skills. The training program is designed to prepare cancer prevention and control researchers to
fill evidence gaps about multi-level causes of cancer-related inequities; to develop and evaluate cancer
control multilevel interventions (MLIs); and develop and test strategies to increase the adoption, imple-
mentation, sustainment, and scale up of effective interventions in community and health care settings.
The proposed program renewal builds on a 29-year track-record preparing fellows (many from un-
derrepresented minority groups, 44% currently) to become independent, skilled, and principled cancer
control scientists. Using exceptional innovative instruction, mentored learning experiences, professional
development skills, participatory research processes, and hands-on experience in diverse settings, the
proposed training program prepares fellows to conduct pragmatic, actionable, research that addresses
cancer-related health inequities. Outstanding cancer control researchers participating as mentors and co-
mentors have created long-standing community and healthcare research partnerships across the state,
nationally, and globally, and a wide variety of cancer-related funding from diverse federal and non-federal
sources providing unparalleled opportunities for trainees. Key areas of the program include: (1) training
on the use of large databases such as healthcare claims, EHRs, surveys, and cancer registry data to iden-
tify multi-level cancer-related determinants; 2) training on innovative research design and analytic skills
such as geo-spatial analysis, systems science, Bayesian approaches, ecological momentary assessment,
and pragmatic trial designs, to tackle the multilevel, multidimensional, factors influencing cancer; 3) the
development and evaluation of MLIs using community based participatory research and systematic plan-
ning; and 4) training on adaptation of cancer control interventions, and the design and testing of imple-
mentation strategies. By the end of the current cycle, our program will have graduated 68 fellows and 5
fellows will continue their training in the next cycle. In this renewal, the training program will appoint 15
new trainees, supporting approximately 4 predoctoral and 4 postdoctoral positions annually. Building on
a strong track record, the program will continue to recruit, retain, and train minority pre- and postdoc-
toral fellows with a strong commitment to research for the elimination of cancer-related health inequities."
10912634,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common disease with high risk of suicide, great social and economic costs,
and poor treatment response. Hippocampus neuroplasticity is altered in MDD, susceptible to stress exposure
and critical for mood regulation and the establishment of emotional memories in MDD. At the cellular level, our
group and others reported fewer granule neurons, fewer astrocytes, and smaller dentate gyrus in MDD. There
are conflicting findings about the extent to which new neurons are generated in adult humans, and we showed
this happens into the eighth decade of life, while other groups were unable to confirm these findings. Adult
neurogenesis is linked to both the pathogenesis of depressive phenotypes and the action of antidepressants in
mouse studies. Pathogenic mechanisms underlying cellular and anatomical changes in MDD remain largely
unknown. A meta-analysis from the three largest genome-wide association studies identified 102 independent
variants, 269 genes, and 15 gene-sets associated with MDD.
There is an urgent need for using new technologies to investigate cell lineages in human hippocampus. This
project will identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) and genes (DEGs) between MDD and non-
psychiatric control (CTRL) hippocampus, at a regional and single cell level. In homogenized hippocampus tissue,
we will implement our proteomics pipeline using high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), single nuclei
(sn)RNA-seq and snATAC (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin) sequencing. In slide-mounted tissue
we will apply Visium (10X Genomics) and our custom-made slide-seq technology, using deterministic barcoding
for spatial omics sequencing, co-mapping mRNAs, ATAC and proteins (DBiT-seq).
Our pilot proteomics studies showed that DEPs lower in uMDD vs. CTRL promote mitosis, differentiation, and
prevent apoptosis. Pilot snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq identified all types of neurons and glia, vasculature, and
immature cell clusters, which mapped with Visium onto the expected hippocampus subfields. DBiT-seq pilot
studies showed higher variability of RNA splicing in MDD vs. CTRL, RNA velocity revealed high transcriptomic
instability in MDD leading to high inter-patient heterogeneity in the pyramidal neuron cluster, and epigenetic
ATAC profiling identified markers potentially related to MDD pathogenesis. Studying 80 MDD and 80 CTRL, age
14-90 yrs., 60% males and 40% females, with sudden death, short agonal state, clear toxicology, postmortem
interval<24 hrs., RNA integrity number (RIN)>8, tissue pH>6, we will: 1. Identify hippocampus DEPs between
MDD and CTRL applying HRMS. 2. Identify cell clusters’ DEGs in MDD vs. CTRL hippocampus applying snRNA-
seq and snATAC-seq. 3. Deliver the first hippocampus spatial transcriptomic atlas and epigenomic atlas for
chromatin accessibility, identify region-specific RNA dynamics, and determine MDD vs. CTRL multiome
differences applying DBiT-seq. Identified molecular regulators of hippocampus cell viability and function will
provide potential druggable targets for new MDD treatments, to be later tested in cellular and animal models."

Meharry Medical College seeks funding to support the continuation and expansion of the Meharry Cancer
Summer Research Program (SuRP), a research experiences program that has trained several students from
racial and ethnic groups that are traditionally underrepresented in health related sciences. This program will
address the issue of cancer health disparities by increasing student awareness of this issue and implementing
strategies designed to increase the diversity of the oncology and cancer research workforce. Meharry Medical
College is one of the largest historically black academic health science centers in the United States. It has a
proven commitment to training minority
physicians, dentists and scientists, and is a leading producer of African
Americans with PhDs in biomedical sciences.
The proposed summer program will provide an intensive, hands-on cancer focused research experience for
undergraduate and medical students through the lens of cancer health disparities. A diverse faculty of
experienced cancer investigators from Meharry Medical College and Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center will serve
as research mentors for the program. A nationwide search will be conducted to identify and select 10
undergraduate students and 5 rising second year medical students per year who are interested in careers in
medicine and biomedical science. Students will complete short-term 9-week (medical) or 10-week
(undergraduate) research projects that focus on cancers which disproportionately affect racial and ethnic
minorities. Projects will include multiple types of cancer research, such as basic science research, translational
research, bioinformatics, epidemiological and community based studies. Additional program enrichment
activities will include a cancer biology mini-course to teach participants fundamental concepts common to all
cancers. Students will gain exposure to clinical cancer research via molecular tumor boards and simulation-
based education. A weekly cancer health disparities research seminar will allow students to interact with
oncologists and cancer researchers from groups traditionally underrepresented in biomedical science and learn
about career opportunities within the areas of cancer research, oncology and cancer health disparities. Sessions
on the responsible conduct of research will be held on a weekly basis. Students will also participate in career
and professional development workshops that will 1) allow undergraduate students to explore career options
and obtain information needed to apply and successfully gain entrance into M.D. and Ph.D. training programs
and 2) allow medical students to successfully complete medical training and apply for residency programs.
At the end of the summer, participants will share their research findings through oral and poster presentations.
Program directors and staff will track participants through the remainder of their undergraduate/medical training
and post graduate experiences to evaluate whether program goals were met, and identify areas for improvement.
Data from participant and research mentors will also be used to evaluate and enhance the program."
10876354,"SUMMARY
We have known for some time that α-synuclein aggregates to form insoluble fibrils in pathological conditions
characterized by Lewy bodies, such as Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple system atrophy, and dementia with
Lewy bodies. People with synucleinopathies desperately need disease modifying therapies, that either slow or
stop neurodegeneration. In order to facilitate the development of new therapies, the fields of neurology, motor
control, neuroimaging, and α-synuclein biomarkers need to join forces to identify disease far earlier, well before
a neurologist currently makes a diagnosis. In Alzheimer’s disease, investigators have defined Mild Cognitive
Impairment (MCI) before dementia and this has unleashed a series of preclinical behavioral, imaging, and
pathologically-relevant markers that have revolutionized how clinical trials are conducted for dementia. This
same type of revolution in early identification is sorely missing, but clearly needed, in the area of Parkinsonism.
In this proposal, we will define a Mild Parkinson Impairment (MPI) using innovative markers that cut across
imaging and physiology. We will study a preclinical model of Parkinsonism, known as rapid eye movement
(REM) behavior disorder (RBD). The reason RBD is a preclinical model of Parkinsonism, is that 50-60% of
patients with RBD go on to develop PD, and the remainder develop either dementia with Lewy bodies or multiple
system atrophy. Individuals with RBD will eventually exhibit clinical Parkinsonism with varying degrees of
severity. Here, we test the central hypothesis that we can identify early cross-sectional and longitudinal markers
of Mild Parkinson Impairment in patients with RBD. Our goal in this proposal is to study patients with RBD prior
to other diagnoses to identify early cross-sectional and longitudinal markers of preclinical Parkinsonism. Based
on our strong preliminary data and our prior work we will: 1) evaluate innovative measures of brainstem functional
magnetic resonance imaging and task-based striatal-cortical functional connectivity; 2) test our robust marker
free-water in the substantia nigra in RBD for the first time; 3) measure a newly developed α-synuclein skin
biomarker called real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) assay; 4) evaluate motor control assays to
define a preclinical mild motor impairment; and 5) follow patients longitudinally after 24 months to determine if
these imaging and physiology markers progress over time in people with RBD."

Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited disease characterized by fibro-fatty
infiltration of the heart, life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, particularly in response
to sympathetic stress. ARVC is a leading cause of sudden cardiac death among young athletes with no prior
symptoms or diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. Desmosome cell-adhesion gene mutations constitute the
majority of familial ARVC cases, but it remains largely unknown how catecholamine-sensitive ventricular
tachycardia and cardiac remodeling processes are facilitated by desmosome dysfunction. Patient management
is therefore limited to improving quality of life by reducing arrhythmic symptoms or cardiac transplantation upon
advanced heart failure. To begin to uncover mechanisms inherent to ARVC, we performed unbiased mass
spectrometry analysis of ventricular samples from patients with different desmosomal gene mutations. Our
preliminary data demonstrate that integrin β1D is significantly downregulated in ARVC resulting in de-
stabilization of RyR2 ryanodine receptor Ca2+ channels that localize to cardiac dyad junctions. Mechanistically,
we find that ERK1/2 activation in response to desmosome loss results in ubiquitin-dependent degradation of
integrin β1D, RyR2 Ser-2030 phosphorylation, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ leak and arrhythmogenesis.
Importantly, hearts of our integrin β1D knockout mice exhibit ARVC-like disease with increased RyR2
phosphorylation, catecholamine-induced ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac fibrosis. We hypothesize that
communication between desmosome junctions and cardiac dyads is essential for maintaining Ca2+ homeostasis
and that ERK1/2 activation-induced loss of integrin β1D impairs this “desmosome-dyad crosstalk” thereby
promoting RyR2-dependent and catecholamine-sensitive arrhythmogenesis and fibrotic infiltration in ARVC. We
further hypothesize that interventions targeting this pathway may offer a promising approach for treating ARVC.
To test our hypothesis, we have generated three congenic knock-in mouse models using CRISPR-Cas9 that
contain mutations equivalent to those we identified from human ARVC patients. In Aim 1, we will determine the
pathogenicity of knock-in ARVC mutations in recapitulating cardiac remodeling, catecholamine-induced
arrhythmogenesis and desmosome-dyad crosstalk in mutant ARVC mice. In Aims 2 and 3, we will test whether
mutation-induced ARVC phenotypes can be effectively prevented through ERK1/2 (Aim 2) and RyR2 (Aim 3)
inhibition. We expect our studies to show that life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and heart failure from
ARVC can be therapeutically managed by modulating desmosome-dyad crosstalk and attenuating Ca2+ handling
dysfunction."

Lynch Syndrome (LS) is the most common cause of hereditary colorectal cancer (CRC), affecting >1 million
Americans. LS is caused by germline mutations in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes. Normal colorectal
epithelial cells in LS patients become MMR deficient upon acquisition of a ‘second’ somatic hit in the alternative
allele of the same MMR gene that harbors the germline mutation, thus triggering the accumulation of hundreds
to thousands of base-to-base mismatches and insertion-deletion mutations (indels) in microsatellite sequences.
These mutations generate frameshift peptides (FSP) that become neoantigens (neoAg) and stimulate the
adaptive immune system. We have reported that LS pre-cancers are immune activated and present strikingly
high levels of expression of adaptive immune genes. Therefore, LS patients constitute a well-defined and
prevalent population that has the potential to benefit from immune-interception strategies to prevent CRC. We
have acquired a substantial amount of genomic data from LS colorectal pre-cancers and tumors to catalog and
to identify the most frequent recurrent neoAg present in these lesions. In addition, we have been studying
chemopreventive strategies that could augment the immune response and observed increased activation of the
resident immune cells in the colorectal mucosa upon exposure to naproxen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drug (NSAID), from our biomarker analysis of our NCI-sponsored Phase Ib clinical in LS patients. Furthermore,
we have performed a co-clinical trial in a humanized LS mouse model that has observed that peptide vaccination
with neoAg is highly effective in preventing LS CRC with the activity that is further enhanced by its combination
with naproxen, thus laying the foundations for this grant proposal. The central hypothesis of this proposal is
that naproxen is an immune-modulator that activates resident immune cells in the colorectal mucosa, and these
will increase the recognition of NeoAg and activation of resident T-cells eliciting tumor cell killing. To explore this
hypothesis, we propose three specific aims: 1. To characterize the immune cell types that are regulated after
the administration of chemopreventive naproxen and aspirin in LS patients using single-cell genomics and
imaging mass cytometry within a randomized phase II clinical trial; 2. To assess the immunogenicity of candidate
shared neoAg identified LS patients pre-cancers and tumors for personalized immunoprevention using tetramer
bound to magnetic beads in ELISpots, Tetramer stain, and cytotoxicity assays of co-cultured patient-derived
organoids and autologous CD8+ T cells; 3. To profile the T cell Receptor (TCR) of neoantigen-specific CD8+ T
cell clones for tracking tumor immunogenicity in LS patients. The proposed research will significantly impact the
field by developing a combination of a peptide vaccination and an NSAID for immune-interception in hereditary
cancers for the first time. The proposal is highly innovative by combining a chemoprevention trial using imaging
mass cytometry, single-cell genomics, and systems biology to assess trial endpoints, and using tetramers bound
to magnetic beads for positive selections of clones in immunology experiments."

The immune system is capable of eliminating advanced malignant tumors, yet cancer immunotherapy success
has been limited to a subset of cancer types. Conventional CD4, or `helper', T cells play an integral role in
orchestrating immune responses, and can potentiate the function of antitumor immunity: both via activation and
potentiation of antigen presenting cell function and antitumor CD8 T cells. My postdoctoral work demonstrated
that reactivating childhood vaccine-specific CD4 T cells after intratumor injection of recall antigen (e.g. polio
capsid or tetanus toxoid), mediates antitumor efficacy and causes both innate and adaptive inflammation within
tumors. The antitumor efficacy of intratumor recall responses were partially dependent upon CD8 T cells, and
coincided with infiltration of activated granulocytic macrophages with phenotypes distinct from tumor associated
macrophages after direct innate stimulation with Poly IC. Thus, inducing CD4 T cell recall represents a novel
therapeutic opportunity, with a distinct mode of inflammatory and antitumor potential. We hypothesize that
intratumor childhood vaccine-specific CD4+ T cell recall responses instigate distinct and durable inflammatory
reprograming of myeloid cells to potentiate antitumor CD8+ T cell function and mediate antitumor efficacy. To
test this hypothesis, we will define reprogramming of innate immunity after triggering intratumor recall responses
and determine its role in mediating antitumor efficacy (Aim 1) and test if polio vaccine-specific CD4+ T cell recall
responses `help' antitumor CD8+ T cells (Aim 2). These analyses will inform clinically actionable routes to develop
recall antigen-based therapies that enlist CD4 T cell help within tumors (the goal of the independent, R00 phase).
The clinical translation of these findings will be informed by identifying therapeutic strategies, such as combined
innate pattern recognition receptor agonist therapy, that may synergize with recall antigens in mediating systemic
antitumor efficacy; as well as identifying more targeted molecular routes to recapitulate CD4 T cell help in tumors
therapeutically (Aim 3). The K99 phase of this work will be mentored by several distinguished experts in tumor
immunobiology and cancer immunotherapy: including Drs. Darell Bigner (primary Mentor, cancer immunotherapy
of brain tumors), Simon Gregory (computational expert), Qi Jing-Li (T cell biologist using transcriptome analyses
to gauge T cell function), Amy Heimberger (tumor associated myeloid cell expert who has previously applied
transcriptome analyses to define activation/suppressive features of tumor associated myeloid cells), and James
Herndon II (biostatistical support). This proposal will enable clinical translation of recall antigens to cancer
patients and will seed a research program that leverages the potent immune-stimulating effects of CD4+ T cell
help to develop novel cancer therapies."

The straightforward laboratory preparation of structural motifs commonly found in therapeutic agents in a
selective fashion and utilizing readily available chemicals is a major driving force in the development of new
synthetic strategies and catalysis. In our laboratory, we have adopted synthesis and catalysis development via
unconventional single-electron transfer chemistry of aromatic N-oxides, readily accessible, tunable, and versatile
compounds. Our long-term research goal is to develop and understand the single-electron transfer process of
aromatic N-oxides that could offer new chemical space and access to synthesis and catalysis enabling discovery
and innovation across synthetic and biological systems. The five-year research program will lead to a greater
understanding of the currently underdeveloped single-electron transfer chemistry of aromatic N-oxides, and it is
expected to broadly expand its use as a new and practical means of accessing new chemical space for synthetic
methodology and catalysis development. The outcomes of the proposed research will have the potential to be
transformational in that they will 1) aid in ushering in the future development of single-electron chemistry of
aromatic N-oxides; 2) expedite the design, development and manufacture of medicines to manage and treat
diseases; 3) conceptualize catalytic and selective transformations of societal importance, thereby moving
synthesis and therapeutic development vertically.
 Based on our research accomplishments and exciting preliminary data we have obtained in the arenas of 1)
vinyl radical chemistry for concise and efficient synthesis of complex molecules, and 2) hydrogen-atom transfer
(HAT) catalysis for selective C-H functionalization. The proposed research in Area 1 will establish an original
and innovative strategy utilizing readily available alkynes and pyridine N-oxides for the facile generation of -
oxypyridinium vinyl radical to unleash its synthetic potential. Such a strategy will enable the development of a
variety of radical cascade reactions leading to the discovery of new transformations and synthetic methods that
could not be accomplished by conventional methods. This contribution is expected to broadly expand the
synthetic applications of vinyl radical mediated reactions and it will provide new synthetic opportunities for the
design and development of new clinical agents using alkynes for the construction of a wide range of carbo- and
hetero-cycles, and carbonyl functionalities. Our proposed research in Area 2 is expected to establish an
innovative and modular catalyst system for regio- and stereoselective C-H functionalization by developing
aromatic N-oxide based photoinduced HAT catalysts with effective reactivity towards unactivated C(sp3)−H
bonds. The proposed multiple strategies incorporated with experimental and computational studies, including
catalyst structure development, cooperative approach, and bifunctional catalysts, will enable a series of site- and
regio-selective aliphatic C-H functionalization reactions of simple and complex molecular architectures."
10923887,"This proposal is for a five-year research program for Dr. Jon Wisler, an Assistant Professor in the Division of Trauma, Critical Care, and Burn Surgery. This proposal studies the mechanistic events and immunosuppressive clinical consequences of epigenetic methylation events that occur in survivors of sepsis. Dr. Wisler is a highly productive researcher in the fields of epigenetic regulation, sepsis, and clinical outcomes. This proposal couples the knowledge and skills gained during Dr. Wisler’s NIH K08 program relating to epigenetic regulation with direct application to clinical and psycho-social outcomes. Survivors of sepsis exhibit a profound degree of immunosuppression with higher levels of functional decline, depression, subsequent infections, and long-term mortality. To date, investigations related to his topic are fragmented and lack synergy.
Jon’s research program seeks to unify multiple areas of investigation to improve the long-term outcomes of survivors of sepsis. His preliminary data identifies that patients with sepsis exhibit significant increases in DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) activity during sepsis. This results in profound gene silencing and immunosuppression. Additionally, we show that survivors of surgical sepsis exhibit numerous negative psycho-social effects that may represent the clinical effects of these epigenetically mediated immunosuppression events. Our intent for this application is to integrate the
research efforts of Dr. Wisler and elucidate the deleterious biopsychosocial consequences of these epigenetic events coupled with in vivo assessments of longitudinal immune function and restoration. We hypothesize that molecular or pharmacological means to control DNMT function has potential benefits to patients with sepsis for boosting their innate immune function during the recovery phase of post-septic insult. Incorporating and coordinating these areas of research will greatly improve our understanding of these epigenetic events and provide a unified analysis of mechanistic, translational, and clinical outcomes. Under the R35 program, Jon seeks to integrate cutting-edge laboratory-based investigations and therapeutic testing with patient-based assessments including time-course based immunologic dysfunction and altered clinical outcomes. Post-sepsis immunosuppression is an often diagnosed but untreated consequence of sepsis survivorship. This program will establish the time course, functional effects, and avenues of interventions to treat the underlying epigenetic events involved in this immunosuppression. This will generate paradigm shifting treatments for a disease process with significant clinical impact."

Prostate cancer arises as an androgen driven disease and therefore androgen receptor (AR) targeting therapies

cancer histologic transformation from an AR-positive prostate adenocarcinoma to
an AR-negative small cell carcinoma that expresses neuroendocrine markers, often referred to as
neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC). NEPC is clinically aggressive and prognosis is poor. Therefore,
effective treatment for NEPC patients remains an unmet clinical need. A thorough molecular understanding of
NEPC progression is needed for the development of effective treatments for this lethal disease. Although NEPC
tumors arise clonally from prostate adenocarcinoma and share genomic alterations, there is significant
epigenetic deregulation during the transformation process. However, mechanistically, we still do not know how
these epigenetic alterations arise and how best to leverage these alterations as a therapeutic opportunity. Our
preliminary and published data from in vivo, in vitro and ex vivo models (NEPC-patient-derived organoids)
suggest that the N-Myc transcriptome and cistrome is androgen-dependent and drives epithelial plasticity and
the acquisition of clinically-relevant, NEPC molecular program and a reprogramming of the epigenome. Most
recently, based on data from a new genetically engineered mouse model (GEMs), we found that N-Myc induction
synergizes with RB1 loss to deregulate DNA methylation readers, writers (e.g. DNMT1 and DNMT3B) and
erasures (e.g. TET1). Interestingly, we and others have shown that specific molecular or pharmacological
interventions can revert NEPC phenotype to a luminal—more clinically manageable—adenocarcinoma
phenotype. Our over-arching hypothesis, which is based on our published and preliminary data, is that specific
molecular alterations (e.g. MYCN induction/RB1 loss) in prostate cancer cells drive lineage plasticity through
epigenetic reprogramming (i.e., DNA methylation) as a mechanism of resistance to anti-AR therapy and this
leads to transformation to NEPC. To address this hypothesis, we will employ patient-derived organoids and
xenograft and novel genetically engineered mouse models to elucidate the role and specificity of DNMTs/TET1
in establishing the NEPC-related DNA methylation program (Aim 1), characterize the upstream regulation of
DNMTs expression in the progression to NEPC (Aim 2) and to assess the therapeutic potential of DNMTs
inhibition alone or in combination with AR targeted therapy to block the transition to or maintenance of NEPC
(Aim 3). Successful completion of these Aims will provide unique insights into NEPC development, identify key
and potential targetable mediators of lineage plasticity, and provide rationale for future clinical strategies to target
the underlying epigenetic mechanisms that drive the transition from prostate adenocarcinoma to NEPC.

In the United States (US), there are nearly 4 million births per year, and childbirth is the leading indication for
hospitalization. Correspondingly, the prevention of preterm birth and maternal morbidity are important clinical
and public health goals. In addition, adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes are sources of major health
inequities in the US; improvements in obstetric care, therapeutic interventions, and screening or diagnostic
strategies have the potential to improve outcomes for all individuals, and particularly those from diverse
populations. Innovative and transformational obstetric research is required to achieve these goals, making
rigorous, multi-site clinical trials and observational studies designed to improve obstetric outcomes of the utmost
importance.
The Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units (MFMU) Network, by creating a multi-site research infrastructure, is an
important mechanism to effectively accomplish this goal. The Northwestern Study Center, through its use of
innovative recruitment and study designs, strong scientific leadership, outstanding academic
productivity, and a large and diverse patient population available for research, has been a productive
member of the MFMU Network since 2001. The Northwestern Study Center is composed of two institutions –
Northwestern University and NorthShore University HealthSystem – that have a two-decade history of successful
collaboration, including within the MFMU Network. The combined volume of birthing individuals receiving
care at these sites is 19,000 births; a high volume of these births occur to individuals who are from
diverse, underrepresented populations or at high risk for adverse outcomes.
In this application, we propose that the Northwestern Study Center continues to participate in the NICHD MFMU
Network. A team of experienced clinical researchers (Lynn Yee, MD, MPH; Michelle Kominiarek, MD, MS; Beth
Plunkett, MD, MPH; Gail Mallett, RN), who have longstanding and nationally-recognized expertise with obstetric
clinical research in general and the MFMU Network specifically, lead this renewal application. With strong
institutional support, a uniquely collaborative research environment, and prior successful participation in and
leadership of multi-site clinical trials, the Northwestern Study Center will continue its significant contributions to
the MFMU Network’s goals through robust enrollment of socioeconomically diverse individuals and the
completion of novel and important studies."
10877800,"Black adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) face disparities in diabetes-related health outcomes such as
higher risk for suboptimal glycemic control, which can lead to diabetes complications. Given the critical
protective role played by families in the health of adolescents with T1D, family-based interventions have
commonly been used as a strategy to promote optimal adolescent health. However, despite the extensive
literature documenting health disparities, few randomized clinical trials, including those testing family-based-
interventions, have included adequate samples of Black adolescents with T1D. Moreover, rigorous, adequate
powered clinical trials testing behavioral interventions specifically designed and tailored for Black adolescents
with T1D and their families are lacking. Primary caregivers of youth with T1D experience elevated levels of
stress, depression and anxiety, and caregivers of Black youth are at higher risk for such distress. Family-based
interventions for Black adolescents with T1D hold the potential to improve the health not only of the individual
youth but of the caregiver as well, as improved family interactions can have spillover effects for caregiver
mental health. eHealth interventions have shown promising effects in a number of areas of behavioral health
care and may also increase the accessibility of behavioral health interventions to Black families. Our group has
developed and tested a culturally tailored, brief eHealth intervention design to promote optimal parenting
practices for primary caregivers of Black adolescents with T1D. Results of our recent clinical trial where the
intervention was delivered during diabetes clinic visits showed promising results, as adolescents whose
caregivers received the intervention had improved glycemic control and families reported reduced diabetes-
related family conflict. However, findings also suggested the need for further refinement of the intervention,
including the development of additional content to help parents support their adolescent with diabetes
management. The proposed study will include an intervention adaptation phase where we will convene
community advisory boards to develop new material designed to optimize diabetes-related family interactions
that can be integrated into the existing intervention. Subsequently, we will test the efficacy of the new
intervention to improve youth glycemic control, improve diabetes-related family relationships and reduce
caregiver diabetes-related diabetes distress in a multi-center, randomized controlled trial. The new intervention
will be delivered via a mobile health approach to optimize its accessibility. 216 Black adolescents with T1D and
their primary caregiver will be recruited from two clinical sites and receive the intervention or an attention
control intervention during a six-month window. Additionally, we will evaluate the intervention’s potential to
buffer the impact of social and contextual stressors on adolescent and caregiver health. Dose effects and
intervention cost-effectiveness will also be evaluated. If successful, the intervention has the potential to
improve health outcomes in a vulnerable population of youth and their family members."
10890020,"The dynamics of covalent post-translational modifications (PTMs) on histones are a key mechanism in epigenetic
regulation. Histone PTMs (also known as the “histone code”) are dynamically introduced and removed by “writer”
and “eraser” enzymes, while the recognition of these PTM makers by “reader” proteins controls the activation
and suppression of specific genes, motivating downstream epigenetic effects. Histone monoaminylation (i.e., H3
serotonylation and dopaminylation) is a newly identified epigenetic marker that plays an important role in
regulating neuronal transcription, both during development and in the adult brain. Transglutaminase 2 (TGM2)
has been proved to serve as the writer enzyme for this emerging histone PTM, which installs serotonin or
dopamine onto the N-terminal glutamine residue of H3 (i.e., H3Q5) through transamidation. However, the eraser
and reader for H3Q5 monoaminylation still remain elusive. In our recent study, we applied chemical biology
approaches to understand the dynamic control of histone monoaminylation and unexpectedly discovered that
the installation, removal, and replacement of this modification are all mediated by a single enzyme, TGM2. The
biochemical mechanism of this novel regulation is attributed to the formation of a reactive thioester complex
between TGM2 and H3 that can be attacked by nucleophiles (such as diverse monoamine metabolites). Based
on this unique enzymology, we identified an unreported histone monoaminylation, H3Q5 histaminylation, and
found that this new epigenetic marker promotes neural rhythmicity through epigenetic regulations. In this
research program, we will develop a series of chemical probes that can orthogonally label and enrich different
histone monoaminylations. Utilizing these probes, we will identify new types of monoaminylations (especially the
ones caused by gut microbiome-derived monoamines) both in vitro and in vivo. Thereafter, we will demonstrate
the pathophysiological roles of these epigenetic makers. We will also design and synthesize photocrosslinker-
containing monoaminylated peptides as chemical baits to covalently capture possible readers that recognize and
bind the target monoaminylations. The epigenetic functions of these identified readers will be further validated
both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we will employ the chemical probes developed in this study to characterize the
non-histone targets (such as transcription factors) of monoaminylations and elucidate their potential roles in
epigenetics and chromatin biology. Together, these findings will expand the categories of histone code and open
a new door towards understanding the interplay between monoamine metabolism (from either host cells or gut
microbiome) and cell fate regulation."

 Elimination of integrated, replication-competent HIV-1 proviruses from host genomes persisting despite
suppressive anti-retroviral therapy (ART) is the major roadblock to a functional cure. Cells harboring these types
of proviruses produce marginal levels of viral products thereby becoming refractory to immune surveillance
mechanisms. This lack of detection by the immune system, in addition to its increased growth potential, due to
homeostatic proliferation and clonal expansion, extend the lifespan of latently infected cells generating a
persistent reservoir. There is enormous enthusiasm for the potential of precision therapies targeting the latent
reservoir in clinical settings. To achieve this major biomedical goal, we must first discover host factors dictating
reservoir persistence and viral latency maintenance and reactivation before we can leverage this knowledge for
clinical intervention. While previous studies have used several genetic approaches to examine host factor’s
involvement, they hold the intrinsic problem of not allowing to distinguish between direct and indirect effects.
This is a significant issue because one must first define the host factor’s primary function(s) in HIV-1 latency
control to then illuminate the most appropriate approaches for therapeutic intervention.
 In this exploratory and developmental R21 grant application, we circumvent previous issues by
implementing a novel chemical genetics (dTAG) approach to acutely eliminate the expression of a set of host
chromatin regulators (Histone Lysine Methyl Transferases) to assess their roles in HIV-1 proviral latency
maintenance and reactivation. We will first endogenously tag these factors in CD4+ T cell models of latency that
recapitulate the biology of viral persistence in patients. We will then select prioritized candidates for cross-
validation in primary CD4+ T cell models of latency and aviremic patient samples obtained from the UT
Southwestern/Parkland HIV-1 Clinic. If successful, our studies will fill a void in our understanding of HIV-1 latency
biology by describing new basic science and elucidating the most appropriate Histone Lysine Methyl
Transferases for pilot translational studies. Future studies beyond the scope of this focused grant application
will examine the clinical relevance of these host chromatin regulators and devise appropriate therapeutic
interventions."

Hybrid dysfunction offers an unparalleled window into the evolutionary drivers and genetic basis of divergence in key
developmental processes. Hybrid dysfunction can also confer reproductive isolation and contribute to speciation. Intra-
genomic conflicts may play a central role in this divergence, and underlie hybrid dysfunction, but empirical tests are few.
A common source of conflict in viviparous organisms stems from conflict between dams and sires for resource allocation
to developing offspring (e.g. parental conflict). Parental conflict may drive the evolution of genomic imprinting; an
epigenetic phenomenon whereby alleles have parent-of-origin-specific expression. Under parental conflict, misregulation
of imprinted genes causes abnormal placenta or endosperm development, and subsequently hybrid embryo death. This early
onset inviability is common in both mammalian and plant hybrids, but the underlying genes are unknown. I will address
this knowledge gap by pairing population and quantitative genomics, gene expression, and functional genetics to identify
the genetic basis of hybrid seed inviability and test the role of parental conflict in generating this barrier.
 I recently discovered a species in one of the most widely studied models for genetics and evolution- the Mimulus
guttatus species complex. Despite a recent split (~230KYA), M. decorus and M. guttatus are reproductively isolated via
hybrid seed inviability caused by atypical endosperm development. Hybrid seed inviability has rapidly and repeatedly
evolved in this group, with at least two independent incidences in ~230KYA. This exceptional diversity in reproductive
isolation, paired with the tremendous genetic and genomic resources of M. guttatus makes it an ideal system to study the
genetic basis of hybrid seed inviability. By quantifying expression differences among species, I will characterize the
epigenomic landscape of imprinting and assess if divergence in imprinting is driven by natural selection. In tandem, I will
map the genetic basis of multiple incidences of hybrid seed inviability to assess the extent of overlap in inviability loci and
estimate how repeatable conflict-driven evolution is. I will then identify candidate genes and functionally test them by
constructing transgenic lines that alter imprinted gene expression and quantify if abnormal imprinted expression causes
inviability; a central prediction of parental conflict. Lastly, using replicated contact zones, I will assess the dynamics of
introgression between these species to estimate the efficacy of hybrid seed inviability as a barrier to gene flow. By using
patterns of ancestry disequilibrium, I can also identify other putative incompatibility alleles. As I have generated a set of
immortal inbred lines from these contact zones, I can then resurrect specific genotypes, perform manipulative crosses, and
identify putative incompatibility phenotypes, thus bridging long term patterns of selection with specific hybrid phenotypes.
 This project will result in a holistic genetic dissection of a common and important reproductive barrier; from its
molecular genetic basis to quantifying the role of these alleles in limiting introgression in nature. Given that many human
diseases result from misexpression of imprinted genes, understanding the evolutionary forces that shape imprinted gene
expression variation also has significant implications for human health."

The goal of this proposal is to develop a quantitative framework to address sex as a biological variable in
musculoskeletal modeling and simulation research. This new framework will allow the field to understand
how sex differences in musculoskeletal structure influence movement biomechanics, musculoskeletal
injury, and neuromuscular disease. There are many known differences in bone anatomy, joint mechanics,
muscle architecture, and movement function between males and females. Likewise, it is well documented
that there are significant sex differences in susceptibility to musculoskeletal injury and neuromuscular
disease. However, while the use of computer simulations of movement to study how musculoskeletal
structure influences neuromuscular injury and disease has increased dramatically due to advances in
numerical algorithms and computational power, the models that are used are based on musculoskeletal
data that (1) are derived from a male-only population, and/or (2) combine measures from males and
females in a way that averages out any potential sex differences. These profound limitations leave the
field without any tools to examine how the known sex differences in musculoskeletal structures may
influence biomechanics, injury, and disease.
 This project has three key aims that will resolve these profound limitations. The first aim will
develop a comprehensive digital database of lower limb muscles, joints, and bones across female and
male populations of varying body sizes. This aim will be achieved through using high throughput image
segmentation analysis of magnetic resonance images collected of 50 male and 50 female subjects. The
second aim will incorporate the measurements from the first aim into a computational framework that
enables for accurate sex-specific scaling of lower limb models, including the ability to capture the
measured variability in the form of uncertainty analysis. The third aim will use the models in the second
aim to develop a model-based analysis method to generate novel insights into sex differences in lower
limb biomechanics. The analysis method will be applied to examine sex differences in muscle forces
during walking and landing. Taken together, these aims will not only address critical questions related to
differences in musculoskeletal structure and function between males and females, but also provide a
rigorous, detailed, sex-specific digital database of data and models that will be provided open-access for
the entire scientific community to use. This posted resource will empower the field with a set of tools to
rigorously examine sex as a biological variable in musculoskeletal modeling research."

End-stage kidney disease is a disease of aging, exacerbated by multiple coexisting health conditions. Nearly
50% of patients initiating chronic hemodialysis for treatment of end-stage kidney disease are 65 years or older.
Patients who use central venous catheters for hemodialysis access typically undergo surgical placement of an
arteriovenous access—either a fistula or a graft—to reduce the risks of infection, vascular complications and
death associated with catheter use. Arteriovenous fistulas have long been considered first-line vascular access
option, with grafts as second best. However, several recent studies suggest that grafts may be a better
strategy than fistulas for hemodialysis access in older adults. Without evidence from well-powered randomized
clinical trials, these studies cannot be integrated into practice. We conducted the first pilot trial (N=46) that
revealed the feasibility of enrolling and randomizing older adults to surgical fistula or graft placement, with 89%
(20 of 22) of those assigned to fistula and 79% (19 of 24) of those assigned to graft placement undergoing the
assigned intervention. Building on this successful pilot, we propose a pragmatic multicenter randomized clinical
trial in 262 adults, 65 years of age and older, receiving hemodialysis via catheters. Unbiased, comparative
characterization of clinical outcomes and patient views between alternative access strategies will advance the
field, for the first time, to evidence-based vascular access care. Our long-term goals are to optimize clinical
decisions based on objective, age-specific data while incorporating goals of care and patient preference for
vascular access type. The objective of this proposal is to delineate vascular access effects on disease-specific
and patient-reported outcomes, using a randomized intervention, at 6 national sites, of surgical fistula versus
graft placement in older adults who have end-stage kidney disease and coexisting coronary artery disease,
peripheral arterial disease, and/or diabetes mellitus. The overarching hypothesis is that graft placement
strategy will yield more dialysis catheter-free days, lower cost, and better patient satisfaction. Our Specific
Aims will determine the effects of fistula versus graft vascular access strategy on rates of catheter-free dialysis
days and access-related infections and death (Primary Aim), costs associated with vascular access care
(Secondary Aim), and patient-reported satisfaction with access-related outcomes (Tertiary Aim). We will also
investigate the relationship between preoperative objective and subjective measures of physical function and
failure of fistula or graft maturation (Exploratory Aim). Results from this trial could transform the clinical practice
by providing high-quality evidence to guide common clinical decisions on dialysis vascular access in older
adults—a growing population whose care is complex and costly."

Hearing loss is the most common sensory pathology in the United States, with one in five adults experiencing
unilateral or bilateral hearing loss. In the inner ear, hearing is mediated at the level of the hair cells: when a
sound deflects the hair bundle, ion channels atop the stereocilia open, allowing for the mechanotransduction of
sound. The identity of the gating spring, the element that controls the opening of these channels, and thus the
precision and sensitivity with which we hear, is unknown. Connecting adjacent stereocilia is the filamentous tip
link complex, which comprises a dimer of protocadherin 15 (PCDH15) and a dimer of cadherin 23. Previous work
in the laboratory showed that the monomer of PCDH15 is softer under physiological forces than predicted based
on its structure alone, suggesting that it has the appropriate properties to serve as a component of the gating
spring of hearing. Using a high-speed optical trap, I have obtained preliminary evidence that the dimer of
PCDH15 is stiffer than the monomer. In Aim 1, I will examine the behavior of the PCDH15 dimer in response
to force at different critical Ca2+ concentrations. I will perform force-ramp experiments on the PCDH15 dimer,
in which force is increased at a constant rate, in order to delineate its response to physiological levels of force.
There are multiple Ca2+ binding sites in the linker regions between extracellular cadherin (EC) domains in
PCDH15, and previous work has shown Ca2+-dependent structural changes in the monomer of PCDH15. I
therefore hypothesize that the dimer will exhibit a similar Ca2+ dependence and will perform experiments at three
Ca2+ levels to probe this. In Aim 2, I will investigate how EC domain unfolding contributes to the overall
response of the PCDH15 monomer to force. Previous work on the monomer of PCDH15 revealed a class of
unfolding events corresponding to the unfolding of an entire EC domain. I therefore hypothesize that EC domain
unfolding is a critical mediator of tip-link tension. I will probe this by performing force-ramp experiments on a
PCDH15 construct in which each EC domain is prevented from unfolding. In Aim 3, I will study how a mutation
that results in non-syndromic deafness affects the mechanics of the PCDH15 monomer. Approximately
50 % of all congenital hearing loss stems from genetic causes. There are many mutations in PCDH15, such as
the V507D mutation in EC5, that result in non-syndromic deafness. In order to study how the mechanics of
PCDH15 are affected in patients with this mutation, I will perform force-ramp experiments on the monomer of
this construct. I hypothesize that PCDH15 V507D will depend critically on Ca2+ concentration and will undergo
more unfolding events than does the wildtype monomer. Taken together, these studies will yield insight into the
role of PCDH15 in normal and aberrant hearing and elucidate its ability to serve as a portion of the gating spring
of hearing. These studies will be carried out with the direct mentorship of Dr. A. J. Hudspeth in the group’s
laboratory at The Rockefeller University, situated within the richly supportive environment of the Tri-Institutional
MD-PhD Program. This proposal will greatly support my goal of becoming a physician-scientist."
10834255,"ABSTRACT
The International Society for Environmental Epidemiology (ISEE) is the preeminent scientific society focused on
relationships between environmental agents and human health. The annual conference provides a critical forum
for the exchange of ideas and development of potential solutions to pressing environmental health issues of
regional, national, and global significance. It is regularly attended by prominent epidemiologists from academic,
industrial, and governmental institutions from around the world. As one of the most important international forums
for the presentation of human health research related to air and water pollution, the built environment, and
ecosystems supporting food production, it provides a unique opportunity for environmental epidemiologists,
regulators, and public health professionals to present their work, cultivate new collaborations, and develop
solutions to emerging environmental health issues. Finally, it serves an important training, education, and
networking opportunity for junior investigators and investigators from developing countries. Over the next three
years, the ISEE annual conference is excited to continue focusing on the effects of environmental exposures on
human health, while drawing attention to and addressing climate-related health effects and environmental health
disparities while promoting equity and inclusivity. Upcoming meetings include: 1) the 35th meeting in Kaohsiung,
Taiwan (September 16-21, 2013), with the theme of Connecting the East and the West, One Health in One
Planet; 2) the 36th in Santiago, Chile (September 1-5, 2024), with the theme of Addressing Challenges in
Environmental Health, Justice, and Development; &, 3) the 37th in Atlanta, Georgia, USA (August 17-24, 2025),
with the overall theme of Environmental Health Equity Across the Globe. The three-and-a-half-day annual
meeting offers interdisciplinary examination of new research and methods that are of profound significance to
the field of environmental epidemiology. The conference facilitates the exchange of ideas and information
between epidemiological investigators and public health practitioners from around the world. The upcoming
annual conferences will increase the presence of ISEE in Asia and South America, where environmental
exposures are rife, but routinely understudied. Scholarships will be provided to distinguished experts, young
investigators, students, and promising scientists from the US and developing countries, with an emphasis on
those who are underrepresented minorities or from disadvantaged groups. In turn, this will enhance and diversify
the global development of environmental health work forces and foster collaborations and information exchange
both nationally and internationally."
10807039,"In 1986, the NICHD established the MFMU Network to respond to the need for well-designed trials in perinatal
medicine. The primary objective of the MFMU Network is to improve obstetrics care, pregnancy health, and outcomes
for pregnant and lactating people and their infants by establishing and maintaining a cooperative network of academic
centers that perform multi-center clinical protocols in a rigorous manner. Our application entitled ‘Baylor College of
Medicine (BCM) and Texas Children’s Clinical Center for Research in the NICHD Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units (MFMU)
Network’ will meet and exceed these stated goals. In anticipation of this application, we have spent the last decade
cultivating a culture amongst our academic Maternal-Fetal Medicine (MFM) team which encourages clinical research as
part and parcel to reducing maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. The innovation and state-of-the-science
translational and clinical research infrastructure we have developed along the way will enable successful
implementation and execution of MFMU studies at our Center, and enrich the science of the Network. Specific Aim 1.
Work cooperatively and collaboratively as a team of dedicated academic Maternal-Fetal Medicine (MFM) physicians and
physician scientists to develop, implement, and execute MFMU Network trials. From our academic division of 38 ABOG
certified/eligible MFM physicians, we have assembled a core team of clinician scientists with prior significant MFMU and
other clinical trials experience, demonstrated academic productivity, and a breadth of clinical and translational
capabilities. Drs. Kjersti Aagaard (PI) and Carey Eppes (Alternate PI) will continue their decade-long journey as
dedicated “MFM clinical team science leaders”. Working hand-in-hand with existing dedicated MFM research staff, this
team is built with the firm promise of Departmental and Institutional Commitment (dedicated time & financial
resources) and is dedicated to generating the evidence necessary to inform best clinical care for all pregnant people.
Specific Aim 2. Enable the recruitment, enrollment, and long term follow up of our unique and robust population of
gravidae available for clinical trials. Our two principal MFMU clinical sites are nearly adjacent to each other in the Texas
Medical Center in Houston, and are the site of over 11,000 deliveries annually, with nearly 2/3 “high risk” and having
received the majority of their prenatal care at our MFMU clinical center sties. We will address how we will synergistically
enrich the overall Network scope and impact by recruiting & retaining populations who are disproportionately affected.
Specific Aim 3. Leverage the clinical and translational research capabilities at Baylor College of Medicine/Texas Children’s
MFMU Clinical Center in order to develop and expand the scientific richness of the MFMU Network. The depth and
breadth of clinical expertise, clinical trials experience, and notably cutting-edge translational research that focus on
pregnancy and lactation are unique strengths of this application. We will detail the proven capabilities of our Division
members and our collaborators, and identify how our nearly unparalleled special strengths will be shared and available
to bolster the innovation and advancement of the scientific goals, vision and mission of the MFMU and the NICHD."

 Dysregulation of cortical development is central to epilepsy, mental deficiency, autism and schizophrenia.
Cortical progenitors generate the projection neurons of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Understanding
the genetic circuitry controlling the development and function of the cortex is essential to interpret human allele
variants in people who have neuropsychiatric disorders. To elucidate the genetic circuitry driving the
development of cortical progenitors and neurons, we must define the essential transcription factors (TF),
regulatory elements (REs) and coding regions. The proposed research on cortical regionalization and laminar
specification, will overcome these barriers through the identification and functional characterization of REs
implicated in cortical development. Further, the regulation of REs by chromatin modifiers is critical to their
appropriate spatiotemporal activity8,9. Here we propose to make inroads into these subjects. We aim to
elucidate transcriptional mechanisms through which patterning of cortical progenitors is transmitted to, and
maintained in, cortical neurons.
 In this proposal, we will study TFs and their targets (putative REs or pREs) regulating cortical patterning
and lamination (Aim 1). We will profile the regional and laminar epigenomic states of pREs using purified
cortical progenitors and differentiating neurons (Aims 2 & 3). We will define the activity and function of pREs
using transgenic mice and enhancer deletions (Aim 4). Finally, to define the function of chromatin modifiers in
cortical regionalization and lamination, we will study a chromatin modifier conditional mutant (Kdm6b cKO, Aim
5).
 The proposed studies shift our research from the function of single genes towards understanding how
transcriptional networks orchestrate cortical development. We will integrate, our collaborative large-scale
genomics analyses of forebrain pREs1,43,44, with our ChIP-Seq (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation-Sequencing)
analyses, to identify regional and laminar specific cortical pREs. This information can lead to insights about
human disease alleles in non-coding sequences. Moreover, our results will provide critical information about
the genetic control of cortical progenitors and neurons. Once integrated with human genetic information, this
will lead to insights into how abnormalities in specific gene networks cause human neuropsychiatric disorders;
insights that are essential for understanding etiology, diagnosis and perhaps treatment. For instance,
mutations in Tbr1 increase autism risk40. Tbr1 encodes a TF that we discovered and functionally
characterized2,3,13,38,41,42. We hypothesize that the work proposed herein will identify multiple novel putative REs
(pREs), including for Tbr1, that control cortical development, and will be helpful to human geneticists to define
the function of non-coding mutations that contribute to disease risk."

In an ideal world, scientists devise interventions for human communication which are in turn translated and
implemented by clinicians. Feedback from patients and caregivers is then used to optimize and fine-tune the
treatment. Modern rehabilitation is a dynamic process, and its effectiveness requires coordination between
numerous disciplines and stakeholders. Since 2006, the Eleanor M. Saffran Conference on the Cognitive
Neuroscience and Rehabilitation of Communication Disorders has provided a hub for engaging basic science
with implementation science. The conference attracts professionals and students with a common interest in
language and cognitive disorders, including researchers in basic and clinical research, clinical practitioners,
academic faculty, and students representing disciplines such as speech-language pathology, neuropsychology,
cognitive neuroscience, and linguistics. In this renewal application, we will continue this mission and expand our
coverage to include other key moderators (e.g., access to services) of successful rehabilitation of language and
cognitive disorders. Effective evidence-based practice in the communication sciences and other health
professions requires several stages of development from basic science to the clinic. Thus, we will retain our
format that moves from basic science talks in the morning of Day 1 to applied clinical research in afternoon. The
focus of Day 2 is on the challenges of implementing basic and translational research to the clinical or school
setting, which stem in part from the practical differences between laboratory settings where interventions are
developed and clinical settings where they are implemented. The second day provides a forum to address the
practical considerations involved in translating laboratory developed diagnostic and treatment protocols to clinical
practice. This component of the conference provides a unique opportunity for researchers and clinicians to
participate together in the translation/implementation process. We are expanding this feature of the conference
to include two other stakeholders in the successful translation of research to clinical implementation: individuals
with communication disorders and care partners of people with communication disorders. These two groups will
be involved as speakers, discussants and participants in ways that are fitting to the particular theme of a
conference. We will also continue with our mission to train students and provide them with opportunities to meet
and interact with world class researchers and clinicians . Students at all academic levels (undergraduate to post-
doctoral) will attend the conference free of charge. Additionally, we will offer a competitive Student Scholar Award
program open to students at the doctoral or post-doctoral level. The award includes travel, accommodations,
hotel, and a chance for the students to present their research in a poster session at the conference. We will
budget for ten students but accept as many qualified candidates as possible. This program has been enormously
successful, with applicants coming from across the nation and worldwide. Finally, moving forward, the
conference will be hybrid (in-person and streaming) to enable us to reach to a wider and more diverse audience."

Inhalation of sulfur mustard (SM) at high doses causes acute cardiopulmonary failure from a hypercoagulable
state within the lungs, presenting as acute airway obstruction by fibrin airway casts. Acute and early systemic
hypercoagulability also occurs, resulting in macro- and microvascular thrombosis within at least the pulmonary
vessels, and likely other organs as well. However, most people who are exposed to SM inhale a lower dose of
SM, resulting in minimal acute symptoms and acute fatalities. Nevertheless, their SM inhalation exposures
results in the development of significant pulmonary morbidities, including delayed, long-term (often progressive)
cardiovascular sequelae months to years after the acute exposure event. These late-onset morbidities from SM
inhalation include chronic lung diseases, and chronic progressive cardiovascular diseases, such as pulmonary
hypertension (PH), arterial hypertension (HTN) and cardiac dysfunction/failure. These disorders decrease
quality of life for survivors, have no cure, and their pathogenesis are poorly understood. Conversely to SM, high
dose chlorine (Cl2) inhalation is only fatal within a few hours after exposure, due to severe epithelial and airway
edema, severe acute nervous system dysfunction, abnormal calcium storage/release, and acute
vasoconstrictive pulmonary hypertension (PH). No acute fibrin casts form in the airways with Cl2, and intriguingly,
recovery after Cl2 exposure does not result in any long-term cardiovascular morbidities. Mechanisms that protect
from development of chronic cardiopulmonary diseases after Cl2 gas is of high interest. We developed,
characterized and validated two relevant recovery models of SM and Cl2 inhalation in Sprague Dawley rats (LD50-
28d), both of which mimic the human recovery syndrome after these injuries. Preliminary data show that rats
exposed to low dose SM inhalation develop not only late pulmonary fibrosis, but also significant progressive
(worsening over time) PH, RV dysfunction, cardiac failure, and increased systemic arterial resistance late (>14-
21 days) after exposure – as measured by rat echocardiography and hemodynamics techniques. Additionally,
we found that after acute recovery from exposure to Cl2 inhalation, a complete cardiovascular recovery occurs
by 29 days (or earlier). Proteomics pathway analysis and histopathologic studies from 29 days after SM inhalation
indicate significant ongoing endothelial cell pathway dysfunction, cardiomyocyte/myocyte pathway dysfunction,
and continued coagulation abnormalities past the acute recovery phase. We hypothesize, that continued
endothelial cell dysfunction during recovery following SM but not Cl2 inhalation will trigger persistent pro-
coagulant and pro-remodeling pathways within the lungs, heart and systemic vasculature, and that this will result
in the development of chronic thrombosis and myofibrillar hypertrophy, leading to late-onset chronic progressive
pulmonary arterial dysfunction (PH), systemic vascular dysfunction (HTN), and cardiac ventricular dysfunction
and failure. This proposal will develop hits for future therapeutic development against chronic cardiovascular
sequelae of SM inhalation."
10931378,"PROJECT SUMMARY | ABSTRACT
Proteins act as the effector molecules of cells – carrying out most of the structural, regulatory, and enzymatic
functions. Proteins themselves are often regulated through direct interaction with ligands, including metals,
lipids, other proteins, and drugs. These protein-ligand interactions are fundamental to diverse biological
processes. Yet, technologies to explore these interactions are limited in terms of both throughput and their
ability to scale. The limits of these technologies are in part highlighted be the fact that for nearly 30 years,
proteomics and genomics technologies research have been unable to fully characterize the functions of the
20,000 protein coding genes in human cells.
To address this, we propose to build a cornerstone technology suite for high-throughput, proteome-wide
protein-ligand interaction profiling. In this work we will demonstrate the development and implementation in a
focused way to highlight the potential of this technology to bring robust quantitative approaches to study ligand
binding at scale. Our technological innovations center on using high-throughput methods to detect protein-
ligand interactions across the entire proteome in a single analysis. To do this, we will measure the change in
thermal stability of proteins induced by binding to a ligand. We measure this thermal stability as a relative
difference in protein abundance using sample multiplexing based on tandem mass tags (TMT). Sample
multiplexing enables quantitation of up to 18 samples’ proteomes simultaneously. Sample multiplexing with
TMT increases sample throughput, reduces missing values across samples, and enables complex
experimental designs – e.g., time courses, dose dependency, and knockout-rescue experiments.
Over the course of the proposed work, we will build new proteomics technologies to harness the benefits of
proteome-wide thermal stability assays and TMT quantitation to characterize protein-ligand interactions. The
combination of (1) intelligent mass spectrometric data acquisition, (2) proteome thermal stability profiling, and
(3) sample multiplexing will enable us to decipher the complex interplay between proteins and ligands across
the proteome. With an eye towards translational research, we will focus at first on small-molecule drugs as
ligands as we can acquire diverse libraries with known primary protein targets. These data and methods will be
used to reveal the functional and secondary effects of ligand perturbation of the proteome by leveraging
matched whole proteome and gene expression profiles to determine to what extent specific drug-protein-
engagement drives cellular responses."
10896326,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Immune receptors of the adaptive immune system (antibody/B-cell or T-cell receptors, or AIRR data) are
designed to recognize and remove pathogens, and also recognize and preserve self-molecules. Therefore, these
receptors have to be highly variable; it has been estimated that the number of possible human B-cell receptors
approaches 1013. In addition to the diversity of these receptor sequences, the genes that underlie the production
of these receptor molecules are highly diverse and complicated, and the data describing how these receptors
bind to antigens (such as influenza) are also highly complex. Repositories to curate, analyze, and share these
data are necessary to characterize B/T cell function in disease, as well as facilitate the discovery of new vaccine
leads and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies to suppress autoimmune disease and cancer. Such data
repositories are available, but they tend to focus on only one aspect of the data. Given that these repositories
typically have been developed independently, the primary data and associated metadata (age, demography,
sex, etc.) of the samples are stored in non-compatible forms, and in addition, the enormous size and complexity
of the data make data sharing and integrated analyses extremely challenging. The goal of the proposed research
is to establish the integrated AIRR Knowledge Commons (i-AKC), a novel knowledgebase that will allow
seamless access, exploration, analysis, querying, and downloading of these various data types from a single
point of entry. Our approach will be based on the very successful AIRR Community initiative, a group of
immunologists, bioinformaticians, and experts in ethics and data sharing who have worked together since 2015
to develop protocols and standards for analysis and data sharing tools. One of the outcomes of the AIRR
Community is the AIRR Data Commons, a set of data repositories that store the immense immune receptor
repertoires that underlie the adaptive immune response. The proposed research takes the next important step
of integrating (1) the AIRR Data Commons with repositories of (2) antigen/receptor binding and (3) germline
immune genes. Steps to producing the i-AKC are (1) develop a common data model and establish common data
elements relying on existing ontologies and community standards, (2) integrate the data using innovative
algorithms and automation tools and enrich it with new knowledge derived from algorithms operating on the
integrated data, and (3) community building. Using the i-AKC, researchers will, for example, be able to discover
receptor sequences based on metadata or sequence searches, seamlessly examine information on the germline
genes underlying these receptor sequences or examine what is known about the binding targets of these
receptors. This novel and innovative knowledgebase will facilitate data and knowledge exploration that would be
prohibitively difficult using sets of “siloed” repositories and will greatly accelerate biomedical research in
autoimmune disease, infectious disease, transplantation, and cancer and directly improve patient care."

Alcohol and cannabis are the most misused psychoactive substances in the United States, particularly among
young adults (aged 18 to 25 years). African Americans use cannabis at higher rates than Whites, and they also
are more likely to be diagnosed with cannabis use disorder and alcohol use disorder than Whites. Racism and
discrimination are potentially key social determinants of African American drug use, and a substantial body of
research has shown the negative impact of direct, interpersonal discrimination on African American young
adults. Studies have also linked racial discrimination experiences to alcohol and cannabis use and their co-
use, but this link is almost exclusively based on findings from correlational studies that use retrospective
reports of direct interpersonal experiences with discrimination. There is a lack of knowledge on the effects of
vicarious discrimination—a form of racism that is more commonly experienced than direct discrimination. There
also have been few experimental studies examining effects racism and discrimination on drug use; such
research is necessary to help establish a causal link between experiences of racism and discrimination and
substance use. The main objective of the proposed research is to examine effects of both direct and vicarious
racial discrimination on alcohol and cannabis use and co-use. Other objectives are to evaluate indirect
pathways explaining this link by way of stress, rumination, and coping motives, and to evaluate the buffering
role of racial private regard. We propose a novel between-group experiment that uses virtual reality to expose
African American males and females (N = 456, 18-25 years) to different discrimination experiences. Using
validated, semi-structured scripts in experimental simulations, virtual reality has the unique advantages of
immersing research participants in realistic environments and interpersonal exchanges to promote ecological
and internal validity of the findings. Experimental conditions will include direct discrimination, vicarious
discrimination, and non-racism daily hassles. We will assess participants’ acute stress and coping motives to
use alcohol or cannabis, or both, in real time, and assess their anger rumination and alcohol and cannabis use
and co-use status 24 and 48 hours following the lab procedures. Three specific aims will be pursued: (1)
determine the causal effects of direct and vicarious racial discrimination on alcohol and cannabis use and co-
use, (2) identify pathways linking discrimination experiences to alcohol and cannabis use via acute stress and
anger rumination, and subsequently coping motives, and (3) delineate the protective role of racial private
regard on the effects of direct and vicarious discrimination on acute stress. This application aligns closely with
NIDA’s Racial Equity Initiative and funding priority on polysubstance use, and NIH’s UNITE Initiative."
10898023,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Wnt5a-Ror signaling pathway is essential for embryonic tissue morphogenesis. Disruption of Wnt5a-Ror
signaling results in birth defects such as Robinow syndrome and Brachydactyly Type B, and is frequently
implicated in cancer metastasis and inflammatory disorders. The Wnt5a protein is palmitoleoylated at a
conserved serine, a unique feature shared by all the Wnt ligands, which require the GPCR-like protein Wntless
to transport their lipid-modified mature forms from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane for
secretion. In contrast to the canonical Wnts whose mechanisms are relatively well characterized, Wnt5a signals
noncanonically through the ROR family of receptor tyrosine kinases (ROR1/2), which is independent of the
transcriptional factor β-catenin. Despite its physiological and pathological importance, the mechanisms of Wnt5a-
Ror signaling remain poorly understood. The major unanswered questions include how Wnt5a is secreted, how
Wnt5a activates RORs and how active RORs transduce Wnt5a signals to the cytoplasm. In preliminary work, we
determined a Cryo-EM structure of Wnt5a in complex with Wntless that reveals an unanticipated feature of Wnt5a
with important implications for its non-canonical function. We showed that purified extracellular domain (ECD) of
ROR2 promotes Wnt5a secretion, together with the recent crystal structure of Drosophila ROR2 ECD bound with
palmitoleic acid, suggesting that ROR2 directly recognizes the Wnt5a lipid. In addition, we developed a
peroxidase APEX2-catalyzed proximity labeling approach, and by quantitative multiplexed proteomics, we
demonstrated that for the first time, the recruitment of the downstream effector protein Dishevelled (DVL) to the
ROR receptors is exclusively dependent on Wnt5a stimulation. Based on these results, we propose to combine
biochemistry, structural, cell biology and proteomic studies to accomplish the following aims: A) To characterize
how Wntless transports Wnt5a, and how Wntless is recycled after Wnt5a secretion; B) To determine how Wnt5a
binds and activates the ROR receptors; and C) To elucidate how active ROR receptors trigger the downstream
cytoplasmic signaling events. These studies will have high impacts for the following reasons: 1) They will
advance our mechanistic understanding of Wnt5a-Ror signaling; 2) They will help explain the pathogenesis of
human diseases caused by abnormal Wnt5a-Ror signaling; 3) They will facilitate the therapeutic discoveries by
providing novel targets and strategies to treat Wnt5a-associated cancers; and 4) The APEX2-catalyzed proximity
labeling and proteomic approach that we developed will have broad applications to study signal transduction
pathways beyond Wnt5a-Ror signaling."

Growing Data-science Research in Africa to Stimulate Progress (GRASP)
Efforts to address the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Africa have
been hugely impaired by the vast deficit of sustainable & indigenous research capacities &
adequately qualified personnel vital for articulating personalized, context-specific interventions for
African populations. Neurological disorders are a leading NCD cause of death and disability. Brain
health, which determines brain capital, is central to achieving overall health and all sustainable
development goals. However, the current DS-I Africa programs do not have a dedicated training
program in brain health research to unravel its determinants, especially sociodemographic and lifestyle
factors which play a major role elsewhere.
GRASP is aimed at developing a sustainable cohort of scientists to tackle the brain health burden
by improving the data science skill of selected African scholars to unravel sociodemographic
determinants and dietary & lifestyle factors affecting brain health & cardiovascular risk using the
SIREN, ARISES, CHAIR, & other relevant datasets in H3Africa & DS-I Africa consortia and
beyond. This will include integrating sociodemographic data with cognitive, neuroimaging,
genomics, climate & geographical data, in mentored research projects & consortia-related
activities in a multidisciplinary team of five selected researchers-in-training & their elite mentors
annually for three years.
GRASP will increase the scholars' scientific knowledge, professional skills, motivation, &
credentials in the field of translational data science research with a specific focus on Brain health
with emphasis on identifying sociodemographic determinants and other markers and patterns in
data from genomics, brain imaging, Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping & public
health data. The training comprises a 9-month Postgraduate Certificate program that will include
six (6) months of online training activities & a compulsory six (6) weeks intensive residency at the
University of Ibadan (UI), Nigeria and a research project. Mentoring will be enhanced via mentor
matching (content & analytic area) & peer mentoring networks. Each scholar in the Postgraduate
Certificate program will be assigned to a mentor/supervisor (preferably a faculty member of the
training or host institutions & mentoring will take place online or face-to-face based on the
mentor/mentee preference).The effectiveness of GRASP will be monitored based on Scholar
academic positions & publications; and funding for investigator-initiated research projects or
career development awards.

Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has become a global problem since it spread from the Indian Ocean region,
around the globe. In 2014, this expansion included a major outbreak in Latin America and the Caribbean
that has led to endemicity in several countries. The cost of the disease as a public health issue is substantial,
given the chronic arthritis that tends to arise post-infection. Without a vaccine or drug treatment, vector
control is the only solution for limiting the disease. CHIKV is transmitted by two species of mosquito, Aedes
albopictus and Aedes aegypti, which have spread to inhabit much of the temperate and tropical regions of
the world. Because it is very distantly related to its more ubiquitous cousin, dengue virus (DENV), mosquito
populations have had little opportunity to evolve resistance to CHIKV. Since both DENV and CHIKV cause
fitness reductions in mosquitoes, they have the potential to act as a selective force in populations where
they occur. CHIKV’s potential for expanded impact is concerning, given that it appears better able to infect
mosquitoes than DENV. In Aim 1, we take an experimental evolution approach to understand the relative
potential for mosquitoes to evolve resistance to CHIKV compared to DENV. In the evolved lines we will use
genome-wide association to identify candidate SNPs/genes that underpin virus resistance. Using efficient
CRISPR-Cas9 methods developed specifically for Ae. aegypti, we can then test the functional involvement
of top candidate genes in resistance. In Aim 2, we explore the functional importance of the suite of genetic
variants that exist globally in a CHIKV envelope protein-encoding gene (E2). E2 mediates entry into
mosquito tissues, and variation in the gene can affect vector transmissibility. In completing these aims, we
will generate new tools and apply emerging tools in a new context including the use of improved
fluorescent reporter viruses in mosquitoes rather than in vitro and the adaptation of the ‘Vectorchip’ vector
competence system for use with CHIKV and Ae. albopictus. The key knowledge gaps we will address
are (i) whether with the assistance of mosquito genetic diversity and resistance evolution if CHIKV
transmission is likely to evolve to lower levels with time, (ii) a list of potential anti-CHIKV and shared anti-
CHIKV and DENV mosquito genes to target in genetic modification approaches, and (iii) an understanding
of how circulating E2 variants in CHIKV genome may shape mosquito infectivity and the global landscape
of CHIKV epidemiology."

Racial and ethnic minority groups and those from low socioeconomic groups suffer disproportionately from the
effects of tobacco marketing, have less access to evidence-based treatments for tobacco use, and report
needing more support for cessation efforts. Pediatricians are uniquely positioned to help medically
underserved families to address smoking and protect children from secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure, but
appropriate treatments are rarely delivered to parents who smoke. Emerging clinical decision support (CDS)
systems within electronic health records (EHRs), including those developed by this team, help pediatricians
screen for SHS exposure, motivate parent treatment engagement, and prescribe and/or connect caregivers to
tobacco interventions. Office-based approaches, however, focus only on caregivers attending clinic visits with
their children, failing to reach additional household members who smoke, leaving many adults without access
to evidence-based treatments and children continually exposed to detrimental effects of SHS. Thus, a major
barrier to protecting children from SHS exposure and extending tobacco use treatment to underserved adults
who smoke is identifying an efficient and scalable method to engage all household members who smoke, not
just parents who present to the pediatric clinic with the child. This proposal uses an innovative, multi-
disciplinary research approach incorporating both population health and clinical informatics implementation
strategies to overcome this barrier and systematically expand the reach of tobacco use treatment through
pediatric healthcare settings. EHR-based informatics tools can efficiently identify additional household
members who smoke and proactively offer tobacco treatment. Using a rigorous, 2-arm pragmatic randomized
control trial within a large pediatric network comprising practices with high rates of Medicaid-insured children,
we will compare a novel intervention using population health and clinical informatics implementation
strategies vs. usual care to increase the reach, effectiveness, and health equity of tobacco use treatments.
We will use a Type 2 hybrid effectiveness-implementation design, measuring the clinical intervention's impact
on priority outcomes and testing an implementation strategy. The specific aims are: Aim 1) To compare the
reach of Refer2Quit - a proactive, population health and clinical informatics implementation intervention on
tobacco use treatment engagement for household members who smoke vs. usual care; Aim 2) To compare the
effectiveness of the Refer2Quit intervention for increasing quit rates among household members who smoke
vs. usual care; and Aim 3) To study household member and pediatric patient characteristics that are
associated with reach and effectiveness of Refer2Quit. This addresses a significant practice gap in the
utilization of evidence-based treatments for tobacco, particularly for underserved populations. Leveraging the
pediatric setting can increase access and use of evidence-based tobacco treatments. This proposal will yield a
scalable strategy to address the impacts of tobacco use within under-served communities."

Bacteria undergo dramatic cellular re-organizations in different environments. Understanding the non-genetic,
reversible plasticity of cellular organization is crucial to unraveling the whole-cell level algorithm of survival,
growth, adaptation, and infection of bacteria, with biomedical significance in combating pathogens that can
adapt to various niches and tolerate antibiotics in the human body. Cellular space is incredibly crowded with
biomolecules yet well-organized. However, we still lack a precise understanding of how cellular space is
organized to dictate cellular scale behaviors, physiology, and fitness. The long-term goal of my lab is to
delineate basic principles of how life at the cellular scale emerges from biomolecules and their interactions. In
the next five years, we will pursue this goal by gauging how key features of cellular organizations interconnect
with physiological states and fitness in bacterial cells, in model organisms such as E. coli, and human
pathogens such as P. aeruginosa.
The organization of the cell connects to its physiological state via a combination of physical, chemical, and
biological processes. We will try to disentangle this complexity by testing two fundamental hypotheses
suggested by our preliminary observations: (1) the membrane real-estate hypothesis – the cytoplasmic
membrane is so packed with proteins that the cell needs to fine-tune the density, composition, and
organization of the membrane proteins for optimizing cell fitness, and (2) the cellular surplus hypothesis – the
core biosynthetic machines have an excess amount that does not benefit steady-state growth, but rather is
beneficial for adaptation to a new environment. To better test these ideas, we will quantify and manipulate the
density, composition, and spatial organization of membrane proteins and the abundance of core biosynthetic
machines and examine their effects on physiological states such as growth, adaptation, and cell death. We will
use these results to test physical models that render possible optimality principles by collaborating with
theorists in membrane physics and operations physics. These tasks require expertise in both quantitative
experiments and modeling. Our lab’s experience in biophysics, bioengineering, and molecular biology will set
us in a unique position to perform the research and foster cross-field collaborations and interactions. We also
plan to publish and share new tools and datasets to be yielded throughout the research with the scientific
community, such as microfluidic devices, image analysis software, and databases of protein physical
properties. Whether these hypotheses will be verified, outcomes from these projects can help us bridge cellular
organization and physiology and understand better cellular adaptation, a branch of knowledge that can be
extended to studying other higher organisms."

Asian American immigrants have been particularly vulnerable to health disparities and mental health conditions
during the COVID-19 pandemic in comparison to other racial/ethnic groups. There are multiple reasons: a
language barrier, its impacts on isolation and marginalization, and anti-Asian hate crime and incidents. In the
proposal, we will focus on the detailed component of a language barrier (language proficiency and language
identity), and its effect on mental health disparities. Most of the Asian/Asian American immigrants begin using
English as an additional language (L2) once they arrive in the U.S., after mainly using a first language (L1) from
their parent's country of origin. 1.5 generation Asian/Asian American immigrant young adults—those who
migrated to the U.S. with their parents (1st generation) from Asian countries when they were children aged
between 5 and 17, have been living in the U.S. at least 2 years, and current ages are between 18 and 25—are a
significant health disparity population. However, little research to date has examined how learning an L2 among
1.5 generation Asian/Asian American immigrant young adults informs their sense of acceptance, inclusion, and
identity as well as their acculturation, socialization, and psychological well-being in American society. To close
this research gap, the objective of the proposed work is to investigate the association between learning an L2 and
mental health disparities among 1.5 generation young adults from Asian ethnic groups/Asian Americans as
health disparity populations. The central hypothesis of this study is that for socioeconomically diverse 1.5
generation Asian/Asian American immigrant young adults, those who grew up affiliating with one culture and
now may also need to affiliate with a new dominant American culture, are more likely to experience psychosocial
adversity and mental health disparities. This project has two specific aims, using a mixed-methods research
design. First, using quantitative analysis, we will determine the extent to which perceived language
proficiency/language identity in 1.5 generation Asian/Asian American young adults is associated with
psychological well-being and mental health (Aim 1). Second, using qualitative analysis, we will gain an in-depth
understanding of experiences with acculturation and discrimination and how these experiences relate to their
perceptions of language skills and psychological well-being/mental health disparities (Aim 2). Data from the
study will be the foundation for the development of Asian immigrant-tailored psychological health strategies for
successful acculturation in American society associated with learning an L2 that has not been substantially
discussed. The project carries practical implications for promoting the design and implementation of multi-
sectoral interventions to address the structural drivers of health disparities (e.g., racism and discrimination). In
addition, it will bring attention to establishing the culturally congruent multilingual competence for the
development of 1.5 generation Asian/Asian American immigrant populations' strong sense of acceptance,
inclusion, and identity in American society to achieve the goal of health equity for all in the U.S."

Summary/Abstract
Underrepresented (UR) populations are less likely to obtain advanced degrees in the field of
cancer research. In an attempt to address this problem, the Principal Investigators (Co-Pis) and
their colleagues at the University of Iowa (UI) have previously enrolled 123 undergraduate (UR)
students during previous 16 summer programs. In order to continue our successful summer
programs we are submitting this application for an NCI-funded summer training program in
cancer research for Underrepresented High School and Undergraduate Student Research
Experiences (R25 YES). The proposed program will include a research methods training,
emersion in an outstanding research project, courses in cancer biology, career counseling,
follow-up after the students complete the summer research training program, and community
outreach programming. Our plan is to train both undergraduate and high school students to
encourage their future participation in cancer research. We will also host faculty from these
institutions to expose them to research projects and to learn about development and
enhancement of the science curricula at their home institution. We will utilize of the Ul's
Department of Educational Policy and Leadership Studies in the College of Education in the
development of the course. The goals or objectives of the proposed program include: (a) to
recruit UR students who would not routinely have access to a program that will be designed to
provide opportunities to learn about and perform cancer research; (b) to design a training
program for these students that will expose them to a cancer research career; (c) to provide
career counseling about the variety of employment options such as academia, industry, and
government or private research centers; (d) to provide one-on-one conversations with heads of
departments, directors of interdisciplinary graduate programs, directors of PREP at Iowa, a
post-baccalaureate program, medical school admissions, and directors of the MD-PhD program;
(e) to continue training and career counseling between the two years of the training program as
well as after completion of the University of Iowa's R25 YES program; and (f) community
outreach and extended mentoring. Exposing underrepresented students and teachers to
science and research will support our goal and the goal of the NCI to support cancer research
and ultimately long-term survival for cancer patients or their cure by increasing the number and
diversity of new scientists engaged in research studies, including clinical trials. The proposed
program has a strong likelihood of success based both on our design of the program and our
past successes with previous summer research training programs."
10917213,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Obese and Type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients still need therapeutics with enhanced efficacy and improved safety.
Adipose tissue is a promising target for treating obesity and T2D. However, pharmacological agents usually fail
to effectively engage adipocytes due to their extraordinary size and insufficient vascularization, especially in
obese subjects. Our previous work suggests connexin43 (Cx43) gap junctions are activated and induced to
connect neighboring adipocytes to share limited sympathetic neuronal inputs among multiple cells. Our recent
publication reveals that danegaptide, a Connexin43 gap junction channel activator, significantly enhances
adipocyte coupling and the metabolic efficacy of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21). Preliminary work showed
adipocyte-specific Cx43 overexpression enhanced FGF21’s efficacy on weight loss and improvement in
metabolism, largely recapitulating the danegaptide’s potentiation effect on FGF21. Based on our preliminary
data and literature, we propose a hierarchical and coordinated “ignition-combustion” model by which FGF21
engages the brain and adipose tissue to regulate systemic metabolism. Enhancing Cx43 gap junctions
between adipocytes facilitates the dissemination of FGF21-activated sympathetic signals from the brain and
adipocytes’ autonomous FGF21 signals. Due to low Klb expression in the brain, we postulate the brain usually
receives sufficient FGF21 inputs. In contrast, adipose tissue, especially from obese subjects, is insufficiently
innervated and refractory to FGF21-stimulated cellular response. With several new mouse models and FGF21
analogs developed, we propose to (A) understand the importance of the adipocyte Cx43’s gap junction
channel function in enhancing FGF21’s metabolic benefits, (B) test the “ignition-combustion” model, and the
importance of enhancing “combustion” in the adipose tissue in improving FGF21’s efficacy. We will also test
(C) an orthogonal, step-by-step approach to achieving Cx43 gap junction and FGF21 dual agonism in the
adipose tissue. Altogether, these studies will provide novel insights into how FGF21 coordinates multiple
organs to regulate energy expenditure and how targeting adipose tissue gap junctions can enhance adipose
tissue pharmaceutical engagement. In this process, we will also generate several new FGF21 analogs that can
be tested as potential therapeutics for obesity and T2D."

The mission of our collaborative Bridges to the Baccalaureate (B2B) program is to develop a diverse pool of
biomedical scientists by supporting research-oriented community college students to successfully bridge to UC
Davis (UCD) and complete a bachelor’s degree in biomedical sciences in normative time. Our program entails a
collaboration between UCD and a nearby community college American River College (ARC). The proposed
training plan includes five key elements: (1) Active outreach to STEM-focused trainees from diverse backgrounds
at ARC; (2) Trainee exposure to and engagement with research at ARC; (3) An intensive Summer Bridge
research experience at UCD prior to transfer; (4) Placement into research labs beginning with the trainees' first
quarter at UCD; and (5) A multifaceted retention plan. In addition to research experience, students in the B2B
program will also receive administrative, academic, and career-skills support through our coordination with
AvenueB and AvenueE, programs at UCD that recruit, support and retain biological science and engineering
science-oriented underrepresented, low income, first- generation and women college transfer students (i.e.,
historically excluded populations). At ARC, a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE)
embedded in the first semester major’s biology class will connect interested students to research opportunities
available for units as independent studies. The administration of these independent study experiences will be
led by ARC faculty and technicians with UCD faculty and students providing supplemental programming and
support. These efforts will expand the opportunities for the diverse student population at ARC to engage in
science and research early in their academic journey. At UCD, a Summer Bridge research experience will
immerse students in a research environment that mimics key elements of undergraduate research and provides
training in robust experimental design, reproducibility, data analysis, responsible conduct in research, an
introduction to computation, and career development. Day-to-day mentorship will be provided from staff, faculty
and advanced undergraduates and will focus on building our trainees’ sense of community and belonging.
Following the summer bridge program, B2B trainees will be placed in faculty research labs under the mentorship
of one of the B2B program’s selected faculty mentors and transition to existing training programs (e.g. NIH-
MARC) for extra support. Demonstrated success of the partnership between ARC and UCD will lay the
groundwork for developing similar collaborations with other community colleges."

by completing in-depth evaluation studies of major OSCTR activities, including the Pilot Projects Program and
Translating Practice into Research, allowing leadership to identify key refinements to improve programs and
identify underperforming processes or gaps in knowledge. Our approach to evaluation will continue to focus
on process and outcome measures, in which OSCTR leaders, investigators, and other stakeholders are active
in prioritizing, framing, capturing, and using, for overall program improvement. The Eval Core will continue to
evaluate the overall operational functions and outcomes of the OSCTR cores by assessing short- and long-
term goals, monitoring program implementation, and tracking resource utilization. The Core will continue to
find innovative means to address the efficiency, quality, and impact of OSCTR strategies through enhanced
tracking mechanisms involving bibliometric analyses, return on investment calculations, and social network
analyses. This renewal offers a new opportunity for the Eval Core to move beyond process metrics and
measurements and work closely with the Administrative Core to expand assistance to all OSCTR cores and
support junior investigators to better share their successes and disseminate efforts that promote peer learning.
This will help accomplish a major objective of the OSCTR to establish the next generation of scientific leaders
at our partners by continuing and optimizing the professional development of promising young investigators.
Finally, the OSCTR Eval Core will continue to work with the Tracking and Evaluation Cores of the other IDeA-

10931368,"Project 4 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overall goal of this proposal is to develop a novel strategy to improve efficacy and/or overcome resistance
to PARP inhibitors induced by acidic tumor microenvironment by targeting epigenetic regulator p300. PARP
inhibitors such as olaparib are FDA-approved for the maintenance and treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer
(EOC) patients with impaired homologous recombination (HR) pathways, most notably with BRCA1/2
mutations (also known as homologous recombination deficiency or HRD). However, resistance to PARP
inhibitors remains a major unmet clinical need. This is a hypothesis-driven translational study, and the findings
will be pivotal for evaluating whether IACS16559, a p300 inhibitor developed by the MD Anderson Cancer
Center, in combination with olaparib represents an effective approach to improve efficacy and/or overcome
resistance to PARP inhibitors. Thus, the p300 inhibitor is readily available for immediate translation in ovarian
cancer. Substantial evidence shows that tumors exhibit a lower extracellular pH compared to normal tissues.
Our preliminary data show that acidic extracellular pH causes resistance to PARP inhibitors such as olaparib
in HRD EOC cells. Our CRISPR screen revealed p300, an epigenetic transcription activator, as a top hit
whose inhibition sensitizes cells to olaparib in acidic pH. Mechanistically, our preliminary data indicated that
in a p300-dependent manner, acidic pH suppresses the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA double-
strand break (DSB) repair pathway and reduces PARP trapping, two well-characterized mechanisms of PARP
inhibitor resistance. Our central hypothesis is that targeting p300 using clinically applicable small molecule
inhibitor IACS16559 is a promising therapeutic strategy to improve the efficacy and/or overcome the
resistance to PARP inhibitors caused by acidic tumor microenvironment in HRD ovarian cancers. Three
Specific Aims are proposed: Aim 1 will investigate a combined therapeutic strategy of targeting p300
and olaparib in HRD EOC cells and patient-derived xenografts; Aim 2 will explore the combination of
p300 inhibitor IACS16559 and olaparib in patients with HRD non-mucinous EOC in a Phase 1 clinical
trial; and Aim 3 will identify biomarkers that correlate with response to IACS16559 and olaparib
combination in HRD EOCs. The proposed studies are highly innovative because they challenge current
research/clinical paradigms for PARP inhibitor-resistant ovarian cancer, contribute to new concepts for
epigenetic therapeutics, reveal new mechanistic insights into the acidic tumor microenvironment, and utilize
innovative methods to explore new intervention strategies for PARP inhibitor resistance in EOC. The
proposed studies are of high impact because they will develop novel therapeutic strategies to improve the
efficacy and/or overcome the resistance of PARP inhibitors by targeting p300 with IACS16559 in combination
with olaparib, a major challenge in the clinical management of ovarian cancer."
10915704,"Abstract
Brain function is based on neural systems that comprise a combination of long-range recurrent connections
among many brain regions and local circuits to perform specific computations within each region. Our goal is
to understand how a full neural system mediates specific brain functions. We address this general question
through investigation of a specific visual-motor behavior in non-human primates: visual guidance of smooth
pursuit eye movements. The neural system for pursuit includes extrastriate visual area MT, the smooth eye
movement region of the frontal eye fields (FEFSEM), the dorsolateral pontine nucleus (DLPN) and nucleus
reticularis tegmenti pontis (NRTP) in the brainstem, and the floccular complex of the cerebellum. The major
deliverable of this project is an understanding of the neural system for smooth pursuit eye movements in terms
of the features of a canonical visual-motor/sensory-motor circuit. Our first aim will ask how signals are
transformed in the cortico-cortical pathways between MT and FEFSEM. We will record multiple signal units
simultaneously in both structures while varying the degree of correlation in small patches of moving dots to
control the reliability of visual motion signals. In addition to asking how signals are transformed between the
two areas, we will use noise correlations between simultaneously recorded neurons in MT and FEFSEM to
constrain the architecture of their interconnections. Our second aim will reveal the nature of the visual-motor
transformation in a cortico-ponto-cerebellar pathway from MT and FEFSEM to the floccular complex of the
cerebellum. We will complement existing data from MT and the pons by recording in FEFSEM and the floccular
complex under conditions that will complete our understanding of the representation and processing of visual-
motor gain and expectations of target speed. Our third aim will explore recurrent connections from the floccular
complex of the cerebellum to the motor cortex for pursuit, FEFSEM. We will stimulate in the floccular complex
during both fixation and steady-state tracking while recording from neurons in FEFSEM. The proposed
experiments will extend our knowledge of the operation of the sensory-motor circuit for pursuit, place it in the
context of the architecture of a canonical visual-motor/sensory-motor system, and reveal what transformations
occur in local circuits versus in long-range connections between nodes of the full system."
10919247,"Despite the prevalence of prostate cancer, the current tools available to manage the disease continues to
leave physicians and their patients in a position to overdiagnose and overtreat. The confidence to pursue more
conservative approaches like active surveillance are limited, as biopsy is known to underestimate the grade
and extent of disease, both of which are important for risk stratification. Targeted biopsies, by means of MRI-
guidance, are becoming the preferred way to ensure the most aggressive appearing lesions are sampled in the
hopes of avoiding some of the issues with standard biopsy approaches. These targeted biopsies make use of
multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) which includes both anatomical and functional information that are
complimentary and together increase the sensitivity and specificity for cancer detection. However, the ability to
effectively use mpMRI requires specialized training while the standards for properly using the multiple MRI
datasets are still being developed. To address this issue, we have developed an alternative method that would
provide a quantitative, user-independent, summary of the mpMRI data (qMRI) to visually “map” disease and
assess its aggressiveness. Using quantitative MRI, a Composite Biomarker Score (CBS) map is generated,
with a demonstrated increase in sensitivity and specificity for tumor detection compared to any single qMRI
parameter. Our primary goal is to integrate this predictive qMRI model into a computer-aided diagnostic (CAD)
system (referred to as CBS-CAD) to improve the use of mpMRI in PCa management. Employing quantitative
MRI (qMRI) can address the issues of a qualitative image analysis if the major roadblocks to its adoption can
be overcome. To address the roadblocks and implement the CBS-CAD system we will pursue the following
specific aims: 1) develop an analysis pipeline to evaluate qMRI performance and translate CBS-CAD methods,
2) perform a multi-vendor, multi-site quantitative imaging technical performance evaluation and 3) perform a
multi-center clinical validation study assessing CBS-CAD performance. Our expected outcome of this
academic-industry partnership will be the integration of several novel technologies into a comprehensive CAD
system consisting of a phantom and automated software for 1) qMRI system validation and 2) clinical
translation of novel models for detecting cancer and assessing aggressiveness."

10925239,"ABSTRACT – PROJECT 1
For patients with advanced cancer, 30% will be afflicted with brain metastases, the cause of devastating
neurologic morbidity and mortality. As a result, the incidence of brain metastasis is 170,000 new cases per a
year. For screening, MRI is the preferred imaging modality for brain metastasis, but is prohibitively expensive
and lacks relevant molecular information. We lack predictive models to identify patients at high risk for brain
metastases for screening, as treatment efficacy and morbidity are linked to early detection. Treatment involves
surgery and radiotherapy but with a noticeable lack of prognostic or predictive biomarkers for disease
progression or treatment. Our central hypothesis is that there are common intrinsic features to the tumor and
extrinsic features to the brain microenvironment relevant for cancer brain tropism and response to therapies.
We will determine these features’ association to microglia (Project 2) and peripheral immune surveillance
(Project 3), leveraging biological models to test these discoveries. We will identify intrinsic cellular genomic
features relevant for brain metastasis that can be generalized across many primary tumor types. Likewise, we
hypothesize there are extrinsic features of the tumor cellular milieu in the brain that facilitate the seeding and
maintenance of these metastases. (1) For determining extrinsic cellular tropism, we will characterize the immune
cell types’ states and function in the brain metastasis tumor microenvironment. Using single cell genomics, we
will determine the distribution and functional status of the TME microglia and macrophages across different tumor
types that have CNS metastasis. In parallel, using three dimensional organoids, we will determine the TME-
based macrophage response to anti-CD47, a potent modulator of macrophage function. Our results will
determine the cellular genomic characteristics and functional status of TME macrophages/microglial cells and
their regulatory states. (2) For intrinsic tropism factors, we will analyze genomic features of the primary tumor
and extrinsic features of the brain that indicate increased propensity for brain metastasis. We will conduct
genomic sequencing analysis on matched primary and metachronous brain metastasis, with complete treatment
exposure patient history. With this data, we will determine critical cancer genome features such as the extent of
genomic instability, intratumoral clonal diversity, treatment selection pressure, and TME immune cell composition
that are associated with brain metastatic risk. Our results will identify genomic biomarkers indicative of increased
risk of brain metastasis across different tumor types. (3) Finally, we will use the overlapping data set for intrinsic
genomic factors to determine if there are predictive genomic signatures of radioresistant brain metastases. We
hypothesize there are specific genomic features of primary tumors that are radiotherapy predictors. These
results may yield potential candidates for increasing sensitivity to this mode of treatment that can be tested in
vitro."
10925241,"1 ABSTRACT – PROJECT 2
 2 Brain metastases are highly aggressive, treatment resistant malignancies with debilitating neurological sequelae
 3 and a grave prognosis. Efforts to understand and modulate the metastatic brain tumor microenvironment (TME)
 4 have great therapeutic potential. Studies have suggested that polarization of macrophages (M1 or M2) may be
5 helpful or harmful in cancer progression (1, 2). Microglia, the brain’s myeloid cells, function in immune
 6 surveillance and mediate the tumor-related inflammatory response, including within the context of the metastatic
 7 brain tumor microniche (tumor-associated macrophages and tumor-associated microglia). We hypothesize
 8 brain metastases are supported in part by native microglia (3), and that these interactions can be
 9 manipulated for therapeutic benefit. The role of microglia in brain metastases has been difficult to investigate
10 given the relative inaccessibility of brain metastases samples, inability to isolate human tumor-associated
11 microglia or monitor their interactions within the TME, and lack of models that include or allow manipulation of
12 microglia while still reliably recapitulating the human disease. To overcome these critical hurdles, we employ the
13 following innovative methods: (i) single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) on fresh, human brain metastases
14 and normal surrounding brain (Neuropathology Core)(4, 5); (ii) isolation and dynamic array sequencing of cell
15 free messenger RNA (cfRNA) from human cerebrospinal fluid (6, 7); (iii) generation of human and murine-derived
16 brain metastasis 3D air-liquid interface (ALI) organoids that include tumor-associated microglia/macrophages
17 (Toolkit Core); and (iv) repopulation of microglia with circulation derived microglia-like cells (CDMCs) with
18 greater than 90% efficiency throughout the entire brain. These four innovative methods allow us to investigate
19 the role of tumor-associated microglia in human brain metastases, model immune cell interactions, and
20 manipulate their function in an animal model of metastatic malignancy. Our multidisciplinary team is uniquely
21 positioned to test the following three aims: (1) Test the extent to which tumor-associated microglia create an
22 immunosuppressive TME supporting brain metastasis. In addition to relating microglia function to brain
23 metastasis local recurrence and distant progression, we will cross-reference our findings with cancer cell intrinsic
24 factors (Project 1) and systemic macrophage reactivity (Project 3); (2) Model tumor-associated microglia within
25 the brain metastatic TME using ALI organoids. We will model tumor and tumor-associated microglia/macrophage
26 interactions and determine the impact of immunotherapy on microglia/macrophage activation and phagocytosis,
27 T-cell activation states, and cell death. Our findings will be integrated with expanding knowledge of cell-intrinsic
28 factors (Project 1) and brain-periphery immune interactions (Project 3); (3): Determine how high efficiency
29 microglia replacement with CDMCs inhibits brain metastasis. We will replace microglia with “weaponized”
30 CDMCs to inhibit cancer cell implantation and disease progression.

10925249,"PROJECT SUMMARY – TOOLKIT CORE
The majority of cancer-related deaths are caused by metastatic disease, highlighting the glaring deficiency in
our understanding of the processes of tumor dissemination. Research is substantially hampered by lack of
physiologically-relevant tumor models and molecular tools necessary for discovering life-saving therapies. The
Stanford Brain Metastasis Consortium (SBMC) is focused on identifying the genetic underpinnings regulating
brain metastases, a disease with limited treatment options and meager survival rates. In support of this goal, the
Toolkit Core provides innovative experimental solutions from leading experts in organoid modeling (Dr. Calvin
Kuo), genomic functional screens (Dr. Michael Bassik), and glycoproteomics (Dr. Sharon Pitteri) to execute
the projects proposed within the SBMC.
The Toolkit Core team has diverse yet complementary areas of expertise and is qualified to specifically address
the unmet needs outlined in this RFA: Metastasis Research Network by providing novel experimental organoid
models, and cutting-edge CRISPR and proteomic tools for characterizing and manipulating the poorly
understood signaling nodes driving brain metastatic disease. Specifically, the Kuo lab will provide patient and
murine-derived brain metastatic 3D organoids to study radiation response in Project 1, explore the intricate
crosstalk between metastatic epithelium and the immune microenvironment in Projects 1 and 2, and develop
novel lymphoid organoids for modeling T-cell priming in Project 3. The Bassik lab will provide innovative
CRISPR tools for targeted genetic screens in Project 1 to explore the interaction between tumor-associated
microglia and metastatic epithelial cells, along with engineering iPSCs for Project 3 to develop vaccine strategies
for brain metastasis. The Pitteri lab will provide proteomic analysis for Projects 1–3, to characterize
glycosylation patterns and features in brain metastatic tissue and organoids, thus providing critical biological
insights into metastatic disease. Together, these resources will empower the diverse investigations of the SBMC
toward improved therapeutic approaches."
10925252,"ABSTRACT – NEUROPATHOLOGY CORE
Surgical resection and/or radiotherapy effectively reduce the growth of brain metastases (BMs) in many patients.
However, after initial responses, BMs frequently acquire resistance to radiation and exhibit local and distant
progression which significantly contributes to the morbidity and mortality of cancer patients. Early clinical results
for targeting BMs by immunotherapies, including immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI), are encouraging and
indicate that combination of radiation and immunotherapies will be very beneficial to BMs patients. Currently, it
is not feasible to identify patients at risk to develop BMs prior to radiologic or clinical manifestation and to
determine responses to radiation and immunotherapies. BMs are clonally distinct from the primary cancer
intrinsically heterogeneous, which provides a challenge for effectively treating BMs. It is therefore critical to
identify predictive and prognostic BM biomarkers for cancer patients. We propose two aims to address these
unmet need in patients with solid cancers. In Aim 1. we will generate a repository for matched primary cancer-
brain metastases specimens for clinicopathologic and molecular correlations to support Projects 1, 2 and 3. We
will integrate patient-material collection into the Projects by providing regulatory oversight, quality control,
processing, storage, and tracking of archived material. Matched primary cancer-BMs specimens from different
solid cancers types will be analyzed for clinicopathologic and molecular correlations using tissue microarrays
(TMAs) and the nanoString nCounter platform. Collectively, Aim 1-related research is expected to yield predictive
biomarkers and prognostic biomarkers for rational integration of multidisciplinary treatments. In Aim 2. we
propose to centrally generate and validate clinically relevant, experimental syngeneic and xenogeneic BM
models to catalyze Projects 1, 2 and 3-related research. We will leverage the available fresh tissue collected
from cancer and BM surgeries to generate tools for all Projects, including single-cell resources and in vitro
(2D/3D-neurosphere) and in vivo BM models. Dr. Petritsch, who is heading a patient-derived modeling team, will
lead the Neuropathology Core. Dr. Vogel, who is the Director of Neuropathology, will be a Co-Investigator. The
Core will therefore leverage significant institutional resources already in place to support the U54, and the clinical
trials that we expect to result from this proposed work. The Core will centrally annotate the attached clinical,
treatment and outcomes data for all collected BMs specimens, which include FFPE tissue, TMAs, fresh tissue
and validated 2D/3D and in vivo model-derived resources. The Neuropathology Core will closely interact with
the Administrative and Data Management and Toolkit Cores. By integrating clinicopathologic studies with in vitro
and in vivo modeling of the brain metastatic process, the Neuropathology Core will catalyze BM research for the
entire length of the grant.

10812377,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Obesity, which affects more than 42% of adults in the US, is the leading risk factor for hypertension. While
premenopausal women are commonly viewed as protected from hypertension and cardiovascular disease,
compelling evidence establishes that obesity abrogates the protective effects of female sex and predisposes
women to vascular dysfunction and hypertension. Obesity-associated hypertension (OAH) involves the
adipokine leptin in both males and females but through sex-specific mechanisms. We have shown that leptin
elevates sympathetic activity in males whereas it stimulates aldosterone production and leads to the activation
of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) signaling in endothelial cells in obese female mice. Clinical data indicate
that obese women have disproportionately high aldosterone levels and are more responsive to MR blockers.
However, a critical gap in knowledge is the source of these sex differences. Preliminary studies revealed that
the absence of female sex hormone production with gonadectomy (GDX) had no additional effect on obese
female mice. This novel data suggest that OAH remains leptin-dependent and aldosterone-mediated in the
absence of female sex hormones and that female sex steroids play a limited role in the control of the development
of OAH. Based on these findings, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that female sex chromosomes
potentiate the adrenal leptin-CYP11B2-aldosterone axis in obesity. This hypothesis will be tested in 2 aims. Aim
1 will test the hypothesis that female sex chromosomes predispose to leptin-mediated aldosterone production
and hypertension. We will investigate the mechanisms controlling leptin and aldosterone production, as well as
BP regulation and vascular function, in leptin-infused GDX four-core genotype mice, a model dissociating
gonadal phenotype from sex chromosomes. Aim 2, will test the hypothesis that human female adrenals are
predisposed to exacerbated aldosterone production in response to leptin and obesity. We will take advantage of
our access to freshly obtained human adrenals and human adrenocortical cells to determine whether female sex
and obesity predispose adrenals to leptin-mediated aldosterone production and investigate the effects of obesity,
sex and menopause on the signaling pathways regulating aldosterone production. From these studies, we expect
to identify a role for sex chromosome complement in the sex specificity of the mechanisms of OAH as well as
demonstrate that human female adrenals are more sensitive to leptin-mediated aldosterone production than that
of males. The project will be conducted under the co-mentorship of Dr. Eric Belin de Chantemèle and Dr. Jennifer
Sullivan, Vascular Biology Center and Department of Physiology at Augusta University, which has a rich history
of successful pre- and post-doctoral training. The proposed project is for 3 years of funding with the proposed
aims divided amongst the 3 years of funding, culminating with a dissertation defense at the end of the third year.
We anticipate that findings from this novel proposal will unmask the origin and provide new information about
the mechanism for sex differences in hypertension in obese women and lead to improved therapies."

Many children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit enlargement of the dorsal striatum, a brain
structure within the basal ganglia that is known for its roles in automation of motor behavior and habit
formation. It is postulated that abnormalities in the dorsal striatum contribute to restrictive, repetitive behavior
(RRB), a diagnostic criterion for ASD and a component of other neurodevelopmental impairments
encompassing repetitive motor behavior, inflexibility in routine, and fixated interests. Our laboratory has
previously demonstrated that prenatal stress, which is a known environmental risk factor for
neurodevelopmental disorders, leads to enlargement of the dorsal striatum in mouse offspring. These offspring
also display deficits in striatal-dependent learning. So far, the neurobiology of the enlarged dorsal striatum has
not been investigated beyond total volume and medium spiny neuron (MSN) density. MSNs, which comprise
the majority of the dorsal striatum, form two opposing pathways: direct and indirect. In order to better
understand striatal developmental dysfunction, further molecular and cellular investigations of striatal
enlargement are necessary. In Aim 1, prenatal stress will be used as a model of neurodevelopmental risk and
striatal enlargement. Prenatally-stressed mice will be evaluated on striatal-dependent learning behaviors, in
order to confirm the previously-observed effects of prenatal stress. The ratio of direct to indirect MSNs will be
measured using immunohistochemistry, revealing whether striatal enlargement is driven by one subtype.
Additionally, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis will identify genes and biological pathways that are altered in
the enlarged striatum in a cell subtype-specific manner. In Aim 2, to test the sufficiency of prenatal striatal
overgrowth on behavioral deficits, the metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist CHPG will be introduced
intracerebroventricularly to the brains of developing mouse embryos. This will specifically promote cellular
proliferation in the lateral ganglionic eminence, the transient embryonic structure from which the dorsal striatum
primarily arises. Together, these studies will shed light on how overgrowth of the striatum during development
plays a crucial role in RRB. The findings from these experiments will aid the design of new methods of
prevention and therapeutic treatment for ASD and other related neurodevelopmental disorders."
10909018,"Project Summary / Abstract
MERS-CoV (MERS) and SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-2) are highly pathogenic coronaviruses (CoVs) that have
emerged and caused public health emergencies in the past 20 years. Both of these pathogenic CoVs are
betacoronaviruses, although from different lineages (merbeco and sarbeco, respectively). Like other
respiratory viruses, CoVs enter the respiratory tract and establish an infection in the upper airway epithelium,
where they encounter host innate immune defenses. All CoVs produce double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) as a
byproduct of their replication, and this intermediate can induce three innate immune pathways in host cells:
interferon (IFN) production and signaling, the protein kinase R (PKR) pathway, and the OAS/RNase L system.
Studies of MERS in lower airway cell lines has shown that this virus is particularly adept at evading these
dsRNA-induced innate immune pathways. This contrasts with SARS-2, which activates IFN, PKR, and RNase
L pathways. Relatively little has been done to characterize the role that these pathways may play in limiting
MERS and SARS-2 infection in the upper airway. Additionally, mucosal innate immune defenses such as
antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and nitric oxide (NO) that are highly expressed in the nasal epithelium have only
recently been recognized as antiviral, and their role during CoV infection has yet to be characterized. Similarly,
mucus production and ciliary function are primary innate immune defenses in the upper airway epithelium, and
their specific roles in limiting SARS-2 and MERS infection is unclear. Interestingly, MERS and SARS-2 have
different cellular tropisms in the nasal epithelium, with MERS predominantly infecting mucus-producing goblet
cells and SARS-2 infecting ciliated cells, suggesting innate immune responses to these viruses may differ. I
propose to use a primary nasal epithelial culture system to characterize these innate immune effector functions
in the upper airway during MERS and SARS-2 infection. I hypothesize that previously underappreciated
epithelial innate defenses such as AMP production, NO synthesis, and mucociliary mechanisms
function to limit MERS and SARS-2 replication and spread in the nasal epithelium alongside dsRNA-
induced innate immune pathways. My first aim will utilize a panel of SARS-2 and MERS recombinant viruses
expressing inactive forms of important viral innate immune antagonists to characterize activation and evasion
of dsRNA-induced innate immunity and downstream effects of activation of these pathways (cytokine
production, cell death). My second aim will elucidate the role of ciliary and mucus function during SARS-2 and
MERS infection by pharmacologically perturbing these innate processes, and will investigate the activation of
and the potential inhibitory role of epithelial AMP and NO responses during MERS and SARS-2 infection. The
experiments proposed will begin to characterize immune responses to pathogenic CoVs in the upper airway
epithelium, the primary site of infection by respiratory viruses, with the potential to identify novel targets for
antiviral therapeutics that could be effective against these and future zoonotic CoVs."
10814355,"During aging, tendons demonstrate substantial disruptions in homeostasis, leading to impairments in structure
and function. Given the central role of tendon in appropriate skeletal locomotion and ambulation, impaired
tendon function contributes to substantial declines in overall function and quality of life during aging. Moreover,
aged tendons are more likely to undergo spontaneous rupture, and the healing response following injury is
drastically impaired in aged tendons. Thus, there is a clear need to develop strategies to maintain tendon
homeostasis and healing capacity through the lifespan. Tendon cell density sharply declines by about 12
months of age in mice, and this low cell density is retained even in geriatric tendons. Our preliminary data
suggests that this decline in cellularity initiates a degenerative cascade due to insufficient production of the
extracellular matrix components needed to maintain tendon homeostasis. Thus, preventing this decline in
tendon cellularity has great potential for maintaining tendon health. In addition, the tenocytes that remain in
aged tendon demonstrate substantial alterations in their molecular programs, relative to young tendon cells.
Surprisingly, this programmatic skewing does not seem to drive additional homeostatic disruptions, but we
hypothesize that it is a key driver of age-related impairments in tendon healing. Thus, reversing this
programmatic skewing may restore physiological healing function to aged tendons. While the pathways that
drive aging-induced tendon cell death vs. programmatic skewing are likely distinct, epigenetic modifications
underly nearly every aspect of cell function. Indeed, partial epigenetic reprogramming has demonstrated
tremendous potential in addressing a range of age-related pathologies. In this proposal we will test the central
hypothesis that age-related tenocyte apoptosis driving tendon degeneration, and intrinsic programming shifts
leading to impaired healing capacity can be prevented via partial epigenetic reprogramming. In Aim 1 we will
define the multi-scale mechanisms of age-related tendon degeneration using a combination of genomics,
histological, and mechanical analyses. We will then determine the efficacy of partial reprogramming to maintain
tendon structure-function through the lifespan. In Aim 2 we will define how aging alters the cellular response to
tendon injury using a well-established model of healing in the flexor digitorum longus tendon. We will then
demonstrate that partial reprogramming can successfully restore the tenocyte functional plasticity that is
required for physiological healing. Successful completion of these studies will define the tendon aging
signature and establish partial reprogramming as a novel approach to maintain tendon health and healing
capacity through the lifespan."
10796824,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Active intestinal stem cells (aISCs) are tasked with maintaining the highly proliferative intestinal epithelium, a
tissue with absorptive, secretory, and barrier functions that are critical to homeostasis and survival. Dysregulation
of aISCs can lead to inflammation and cancer, while loss of aISCs due to cytotoxic, pathogenic, or radiation-
induced injury can threaten epithelial integrity and pose a severe health risk. aISC injury is a common side effect
of chemotherapeutic or radiation treatment of cancer. In response to aISC injury, the intestinal epithelium has
the remarkable capacity to regenerate its stem cell pool through dedifferentiation of mature epithelial cells and
their progenitors, which function as facultative ISCs (fISCs). However, little is understood about the genetic
mechanisms that permit this high level of cellular plasticity. One way cells are able to simultaneously modulate
the expression of many genes is through chromatin modification. Ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine
dioxygenases (TET enzymes) are involved in DNA demethylation through the conversion of 5-methylcytosine
(5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), a process associated with gene activation. TET enzymes have well-
known functions in maintaining stem cell-specific gene expression in mouse embryonic stem cells, and published
data from our lab demonstrate that Tet1 is enriched in adult mouse ISCs and intestinal epithelial progenitors. My
preliminary data show that the loss of Tet1 results in aberrant lineage specification, suggesting a central role for
Tet1 in changing cell identity. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that Tet1 facilitates ISC identity
transitions through activation of cell type specific gene expression. I will test this hypothesis with the
following specific aims: Aim 1 will establish the genetic requirement for Tet1 during fISC dedifferentiation
following aISC injury using both targeted aISC ablation and cytotoxic injury models. Post-injury regeneration will
be assessed by histology and organoid growth assays. Aim 2A will characterize Tet1’s gene regulatory
mechanisms during differentiation through genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic analysis of inducible Tet1
knockout (Tet1iKO) mice. Aim 2B will use the same approaches to describe Tet1’s gene regulatory mechanisms
during dedifferentiation in Tet1iKO mice that have suffered ISC injury. This project will determine how Tet1
facilitates changes in cell identity and provide me with training towards my goal of obtaining a research-focused
faculty position studying chromatin regulatory mechanisms of maintaining stem cell function and establishing cell
identity. This work will advance the understanding of regenerative mechanisms and provide insight into intestinal
epithelial responses to damage and injury."
10834243,"Developing a kit-based research use only (RUO) translocation assay for deployment as a lab developed
test (LDT) toward changing outcomes for patients with driver-negative tumors (RFA sub-section:
Technology platform for Cancer Diagnostics)
SUMMARY
Nearly 1M patients are diagnosed with advanced stage cancer per year. One case dear to Arima is a teenage
girl who was diagnosed with advanced brain cancer. Her tumor had been tested twice using state-of-the-art
NGS-based lab developed tests (LDTs), but no actionable genetic driver could be found, classifying her tumor
as “driver-negative”, precluding access to targeted therapies and greatly reducing her likelihood of survival.
However, thanks to the parental phase-2 award, Arima had just developed an NGS technology platform – the
T-Seq kit – to detect tumor driving translocations and gene fusions from tumor biopsies. Lo and behold, when
T-Seq analyzed this patient’s tumor, it revealed a translocation implicating PD-L1, triggering a series of events
leading to treatment with pembrolizumab and 9 months later no signs of tumor, all thanks to T-Seq. This
proposal strives to scale this clinical origin story to make a widespread impact in the 50% of patients with
advanced cancers and no detectable genetic drivers (~488,000 patients per year in US). However, to make this
widespread impact, T-Seq technology must be made available to oncologist and pathologist in the form of an
LDT. The overarching goal of this proposal is to execute all necessary steps to develop and validate T-Seq kits
so that they can be supplied to CLIA labs who will validate and deploy T-Seq as an LDT to inform clinical care.
Thanks to our parental phase-2, execution towards this goal has already begun. From a tech perspective T-
Seq kits are more sensitive than existing tech because they profile translocations through the lens of a spatial
3D genome, rather than a linear genome, enabling detection of tumor driving translocations like PD-L1 that are
otherwise missed. T-Seq technology has also been productized, meeting all the key product products for
deployment as an LDT, culminating in the launch of a kitted end-to-end T-Seq workflow. Lastly, T-Seq kit
performance is concordant with existing tech, yet it detects tumor-driving translocations in 54% of driver-
negative tumors, including 4 patients where the course of clinical care has been altered thanks to T-Seq.
With a product in hand and foundational clinical data, the proposed aims accomplish the remaining steps
towards our goal of becoming a tech provider to CLIA labs. Specifically, this proposal first aims to establish
competitive analytical performance metrics for T-Seq. Then it aims to demonstrate clinical validity and utility of
T-Seq across mainline tumor types, and in clinical contexts of severe unmet need. Lastly, the proposal aims to
validate and deploy T-Seq kits in partnering academic and commercial CLIA laboratories. The success of each
proposed aims is measured using multiple quantitative metrics relevant to that aim, informed by CLIA assay
validation guidelines and key metrics defined by stakeholders in the LDT ecosystem. By the conclusion of the
phase-2b program, the ultimate goal of becoming a technology provider to CLIA labs will be accomplished,
whereby T-Seq kits will be deployed as LDTs in initial academic and commercial CLIA labs, and clinical data,
publications, and awareness of T-Seq will be established to accelerate future adoption of T-Seq as an LDT."
10862572,"PROJECT SUMMARY
More than 80% of ovarian cancer (OC) cases have already metastasized to the peritoneal cavity at diagnosis,
and the five-year survival for these patients is 25%. Within the peritoneal cavity, the most common site of
metastasis is the omentum, a well-vascularized, specialized adipose tissue that arises off the greater curvature
of the stomach. Because the omentum promotes tumor growth, it is removed as a standard of care for patients
with peritoneal metastases. In mouse OC models, the omentum is an early metastatic site, and removing the
omentum before tumor implantation reduces the pace of tumor expansion. Once OC cells shed from the
primary tumor and form spheroids, some bind to the adjacent omentum, which is considered transcoelomic
metastasis. Other data show that OC cells can exit the peritoneal cavity and travel back to the omentum via the
circulatory system, underscoring a hematogenous peritoneal metastatic pathway. Overall, the mechanism by
which the omentum promotes tumor growth is still unknown and is important to identify so that we can develop
more specific therapeutic strategies. Studies suggest that omental macrophages, blood vessels, or lymphoid
aggregates called milky spots, are key features that support tumor growth. In addition to these omental
features, the adipocytes themselves, the cells that define the omentum as a fat pad, are likely important for
tumor expansion. Adipocytes can directly provide fatty acids to metabolically support tumor proliferation or may
indirectly foster tumor growth by supporting milky spot formation, as my preliminary data suggest. To move
beyond these valuable observational studies, I herein propose using a mouse model wherein the mouse lacks
white and brown adipocytes, rendering the peritoneal cavity adipocyte-free, to explore the role of the omentum
in OC metastasis without mature adipocytes. Due to a total lack of fat, the mice become lipodystrophic. To
overcome this systemic metabolic syndrome, the lipodystrophic mice receive subcutaneous fat transplants,
referred to as distal adipocyte rescue of lipodystrophy (DARL) mice. Littermate controls also receive the fat
transplant, known as DARC mice for distal adipose-receiving control mice. I hypothesize that the metastatic
seeding and dissemination of murine OC cells within the adipocyte-free omentum and associated peritoneum
will be impaired in the absence of local, mature adipocytes. While testing this hypothesis, I will assess how the
loss of omental adipocytes impacts the overall omental architecture in DARL mice. I will analyze the impact of
an adipocyte-free versus adipocyte-rich omentum on tumor growth. Lastly, I will explore the role of
hematogenous and transcoelomic spread to the adipocyte-rich or adipocyte-free omentum and consider
whether omentum cells support tumors as spheroids that disseminate within the peritoneal cavity. I will pursue
these aims under the mentorship of an advisory committee that includes physician-scientists. This training will
help improve my understanding of metastasis so that I can ultimately identify new treatment strategies in my
career as an oncologist-scientist."
10778218,"Bloodstream infections (BSI) caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa have a high fatality rate. They often arise in
patients suffering from pneumonia, urinary tract infections, surgical site infections, or patients with severe
underlying conditions, including immunosuppression or chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Systemic P.
aeruginosa is particularly difficult to treat due to its robust host accumulation, high virulence, and extensive
multidrug resistance (MDR) to conventional antibiotics. As such, BSIs with P. aeruginosa pose a significant
threat to public health. Unlike traditional antibiotics, antimicrobial peptides and polymers (AMPs) facilitate
bacterial cell death via stochastic bilayer disruption. Despite their potency and promise, AMPs have yet to
enjoy broad clinical success, primarily due to their systemic cytotoxicity. One of the few examples of AMPs
approved for clinical use is a class of antimicrobial lipopeptides called polymyxins. These compounds are the
last resort to treat MDR P. aeruginosa and are limited in their use primarily due to nephrotoxicity concerns. To
address the critical selectivity problem that plagues all AMPs, including new synthetic AMPs made in our
laboratory (BDT-4G) that are active on polymyxin resistant P. aeruginosa isolates, we will create targeted
antibody bactericide conjugate (ABC) prodrugs that actively target P. aeruginosa and release the active
antimicrobial only in the presence of host factors secreted at the infection site. This mechanism of action,
similar to that used in the field of antibody-drug conjugates, should decrease toxicity due to non-specific
exposure while maintaining the antimicrobial potency at the infection site. The antibody targeting P. aeruginosa
(Cam-003) should rapidly localize to the bacterial cells upon systemic administration, thus concentrating the
conjugated AMP at the P. aeruginosa surface. AMP release from the antibody via host-directed linker cleavage
will lead to bacteriolysis. Linker cleavage by host factors instead of bacterial enzymes will minimize the
pathogen’s capacity to escape the ABC treatment via mutagenesis. We hypothesize that increasing the
residence time at the infection site through antibody targeting will improve ABC potency and minimize
cytotoxicity to the host. Developing ABCs as a new class of antibacterial compounds that can eradicate MDR
P. aeruginosa will be of immense benefit, particularly for hospitalized and immune-compromised patients. The
impact of this effort cannot be overstated, given the current era of accelerated antibiotic resistance."
10817902,"SUMMARY
Dystroglycanopathies, a subset of congenital muscular dystrophies, impact more than 1:100,000 individuals and
encompass a range of disorders with patient sequalae ranging from mild muscular dystrophy with near normal
lifespan to severe muscular dystrophy with major neural and ocular defects leading to death in the first few years
of life. The vast majority of genetically-defined dystroglycanopathies are a result of mutations in genes encoding
enzymes of the O-mannosylation pathway, specifically the so-called M3 pathway. To date, the M3 pathway,
which consists of approximately a dozen enzymes, has only been found to elaborate O-mannose glycans on a
small subset of threonine residues on the peripheral membrane protein alpha-dystroglycan that is involved in a
complex that bridges the extracellular matrix to the actin cytoskeleton across the plasma membrane. In the prior
funding period, we and others elucidated the M3 structure that terminates in a repeating disaccharide referred
to as matriglycan. We have recently demonstrated that matriglycan alone, absent the underlying M3 glycan and
alpha-dystrolgycan, is both necessary and sufficient to bind LG domain-containing proteins as well as facilitate
binding and infection by certain arenaviruses, such as Lassa virus. Here, we seek to address key remaining
basic science issues especially those that would facilitate early stage clinical investigations, including substrate
enhancement therapy, AAV gene transfer therapy, and novel gene identification. Thus, we will test the specificity
of M3 enzymes including testing whether M3 glycans can be built on other non-O-Man glycan structures (A1).
Further testing specificity and to address the evolutionary quandary of building an entire M3 pathway for one
protein substrate, we will test whether other proteins contain M3 glycan structures, which could be involved in
the phenotypes of certain dystroglycanopathies (A1). Driven by our desire to understand the structure-function
relationship of M3 enzymes as well as to inform clinical collaborators, we will investigate the impact of missense
variants on M3 enzymes with regards to stability and activity using our established protocols (A2). Further, given
the high carrier frequency (1:150 in Northern Europe) of the L276I FKTN variant, we will investigate whether
heterozygous and homozygous cell lines harboring this variant are less susceptible to matriglycan-dependent
pseudovirus infection (A2). Finally, given that ~1/3 of all dystroglycanopathies are of unknown genetic etiology,
we will conduct an unbiased CRISPR/Cas9 screen in relevant human cell lines to identify novel gene products
that are required for functional glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan (A3). Coupled to this unbiased approach, we
will also investigate the pathway for CDP-ribitol synthesis, that is necessary for M3 glycan synthesis, to identify
gene products involved that may be responsible for a subset of the unknown cases of dystroglycanopathy (A3).
Completion of the proposed work will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the M3 pathway enzymes
and protein targets, the role of variants in disease and infection, as well as inform the work of clinical collaborators."

 Cardiovascular disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. In fact, 43% of
all deaths are due to coronary heart disease and heart failure is on the rise, expecting to increase in prevalence
by 46% between 2012 and 2030. The need for improved noninvasive methods to detect early disease and to
help manage patients with chronic disease has therefore never been as critical. Technical advances in
noninvasive cardiovascular imaging have resulted in increasing use over recent years. Nuclear cardiology and
echocardiography are mature technologies that are commonly used in clinical practice. Cardiovascular magnetic
resonance imaging (CMR), computed tomographic angiography (CTA), and positron emission tomography
(PET) are playing a growing role in the clinical assessment of CVD and are relatively new to cardiovascular
training programs. The number of physicians who have in-depth expertise in the physics, engineering, and
molecular applications in all 5 major cardiovascular imaging modalities remains limited. The University of Virginia
(UVA) is one of a handful of centers in the U.S. that have high-level clinical, physics, engineering, and molecular
expertise in all cardiovascular imaging modalities, as well as a track record of training physicians in research.
Over the past decade, trainees have been highly productive in terms of publication and half have gone on to
academic careers in outstanding institutions around the U.S. Two former trainees joined the UVA faculty and
have been NIH-funded, with 2 K23 and 1 R01 awards between them. The purpose of this grant renewal proposal
is to continue and further develop the training program that provides comprehensive training in cardiovascular
imaging research. The program provides trainees with outstanding opportunities to interact closely with imaging
physicists and engineers who together offer the promise of improvements in both the clinical applications of
these newer technologies and further development of and applications of translational imaging. Trainees have
dual mentorship from a PhD imaging scientist and a MD clinician investigator. The goal of the training is to
develop the next generation of academic investigators in cardiovascular imaging who can interact across
disciplines. Trainees undergo a rigorous 2-year research training program following a 2-year clinical
cardiovascular training program completed at the UVA or a 3-year program completed at another institution. Up
to 3 fellows are enrolled at any one time. A complete didactic program is offered including instruction in imaging
physics and engineering, biostatistics, epidemiology, clinical research methodology, and medical ethics. Fellows
receive training in clinical CMR, CTA, and PET. Research training is comprehensive and combines clinical and
basic cardiovascular imaging research for each trainee with any of the modalities.

The rising incidence of Lyme disease demands new strategies for prevention. Existing methods
such as acaricides, deer reduction, landscaping, and personal protective clothing, are inherently
short-term and must be regularly re-applied, maintained and worn. ​The Mice Against Ticks
project seeks to develop a durable one-time intervention to disrupt the ecological
cycle of Lyme disease transmission for many decades​. The causative agent of Lyme
disease ​B. burgdorferi ​is passed back and forth between ticks and their small animal hosts,
which serve as zoonotic reservoirs of disease. The white-footed mouse ​P. leucopus​ is widely
considered to be the most important reservoir because it is both ubiquitous and extremely
efficient at acquiring and transmitting pathogens via ticks. Our overarching goal for this
proposed project is to heritably immunize white-footed mice against Lyme by encoding
protective ​P​. ​leucopus​ antibodies targeting ​B. burgdorferi ​outer surface protein A (OspA) in the
mouse germline. According to our calculations, combining at least four such antibodies should
prevent evolutionary escape by ​B. burgdorferi ​because too many simultaneous OspA mutations
would be needed. Crucially, even if these mice are less important in some areas than currently
thought, immunization will reduce the number of infected ticks, which in turn will infect fewer
secondary reservoirs, which will infect fewer ticks, reinforcing a negative feedback spiral
anticipated to greatly reduce the local burden of Lyme disease. We have already successfully
isolated anti-OspA antibodies from OspA-immunized ​P. leucopus​, derived putative ​P. leucopus
embryonic stem cells, and shown that the albumin locus appears suitable for antibody secretion
from the liver. We now seek to (1) identify antibodies that bind to at least four different OspA
epitopes, (2) establish a stable embryonic stem cell line and perform germline editing, and (3)
generate heritably resistant mice that express antibodies from a cisgenic cassette linked to a
reciprocal chromosomal translocation, a naturally occurring form of high-threshold gene drive
that would enable the reversible and tightly localized engineering of wild ​P. leucopus
populations. Our open and community-guided approach has met with apparent enthusiasm by
residents of Nantucket and Martha’s Vineyard, indicating that local communities suffering from
tick-borne disease throughout the Northeast and Upper Midwest may wish to immunize their
own wild mouse populations in order to help prevent Lyme disease for many decades."

10852835,"Project Summary
 The training strategy demonstrated in this document will help me advance my career to be an
independent research scientist in the field of diabetes. I propose to assess the role of arginine transport in the
regulation of pancreatic islet cell proliferation and hormone secretion. Disease progression of diabetes is
attributed to the inability of pancreatic β-cells to sufficiently secrete insulin and the combined failure to suppress
pancreatic α-cell secretion of glucagon. Inhibition of glucagon signaling reduces hyperglycemia for individuals
with diabetes.3 However, impairment of glucagon signaling leads to hyperglucagonemia, hyperaminoacidemia,
and α-cell proliferation.4,5 Our lab has identified a liver-α-cell axis that contributes to α-cell proliferation through
the accumulation of amino acids in the blood.4 We have identified two major amino acids that contribute to α-cell
proliferation, glutamine4 and arginine (unpublished data). However, the mechanisms underlying arginine
transport in the α-cell specifically and its contribution to α-cell proliferation and secretion are not well defined.
The cationic amino acid transporter SLC7A2 is highly expressed in mouse and human pancreatic α-cells.
Therefore, we hypothesize that hyperaminoacidemia that results from interrupted glucagon signaling
contributes to increased arginine transport promoting α-cell proliferation and dysfunction. Our
preliminary studies show that SLC7A2 is required for α-cell proliferation and glucagon secretion even when
challenged with strong membrane depolarizing agents challenging current cation-centric models of arginine
stimulated secretion (Figure 2 and 4). Using a new α-cell specific Slc7a2 knockout mouse model, we will unravel
the molecular mechanisms that lead to arginine-stimulated α-cell proliferation and glucagon secretion. To assess
whether SLC7A2 in α-cells is necessary for amino acid-dependent α-cell proliferation, Slc7a2 knockout in
immortalized mouse αTC1-6 cells and an inducible α-cell specific Slc7a2 knockout mouse model will be used to
assess changes in α-cell proliferation and mass. Additionally, the mechanism of arginine-induced mTORC1
activation will be targeted to determine if arginine activates mTORC1 through the inactivation of the CASTOR1-
GATOR2 pathway (Aim 1). Furthermore, to test the ability for arginine transport via SLC7A2 to modulate
glucagon secretion we will combine tools used in Aim 1 with chemical and genetically encoded Ca2+ sensors to
observe changes in α-cell glucagon secretion. We will also measure nitric oxide levels, and test the affect of
nitric oxide on glucagon secretion to understand the mechanism behind arginine-induced glucagon secretion
(Aim 2). Successfully accomplishing this study will enhance our current understanding of amino acid-induced α-
cell proliferation and function, as well as broaden the possibilities of therapeutic treatments for diabetes. My
training will be achieved through the execution of this study utilizing the fantastic resources and facilities provided
by Vanderbilt and thorough mentorship from my highly qualified mentors, Drs. Danielle Dean and David
Jacobsen."
10918125,"Hypertension is world’s largest contributing factor to disease and mortality. Diets high in saturated fat are
increasingly linked to the development of hypertension, although the patho-physiological mechanisms
responsible for the development of hypertension remain poorly understood. This proposal examines a novel
molecular mechanism by which a chronic high saturated fat diet (HFD) activates the immune system to promote
increases in adiposity and blood pressure (BP). Moreover, although young women are typically protected from
hypertension relative to age-matched men, epidemiological studies suggest that the cardiovascular protection
typically associated with young women is compromised by chronic consumption of a diet high in saturated fat.
Our study will examine the novel central hypothesis that a chronic HFD causes a greater increase in BP in
females via sex-specific activation and recruitment of immune cells. Studies will further test the hypothesis that
greater NLRP3 activation in females drives enhanced immune cell activation with a chronic HFD. Adipose tissue
is a critical intermediary between immune cell activation and hypertension and the NLRP3 inflammasome
contributes to adipose tissue inflammation. Proposed experiments will expand our understanding of how a HFD
promotes the development of hypertension in adult males and females by testing two specific aims. Aim 1 will
test the hypothesis that greater NLRP3 activation with chronic HFD in females results in a more pro-inflammatory
immune cell profile compared to males resulting in greater increases in BP. Experiments will measure the impact
of HFD on NLRP3 expression and activation in male and female rats, assess the contribution of NLRP3 to HFD-
induced increases in inflammation and hypertension using novel genetic knockouts, and begin to translate our
findings by measuring NLRP3 in isolated peripheral blood monocytes in a cohort of Black and White, lean and
obese men and women. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that immune cells promote greater adipose tissue
expansion in females with a HFD. Experiments will determine if the impact of HFD on macrophage and T cell
transcriptional profiles and adipose tissue is sex-specific, assess the contributions of NLRP3 and T cells to HFD-
induced alterations in adipose tissue using novel genetic models, use adoptive transfer studies and adipose
tissue transplants to assess the relative contributions of T cells vs. adipose tissue on HFD-induced adipocyte
expansion, inflammation and hypertension, and determining if gender impacts the relationships between BMI,
BP, inflammation and CVD risk in a human subject cohort. Therapies targeting the pathophysiological cause of
hypertension will undoubtedly improve BP control rates and prevent premature death from CVD in both sexes.
Results of this work will transform our understanding of immune mechanisms in HFD-induced hypertension by
utilizing novel approaches, revealing new paradigms, and providing insight with the potential to improve
clinical/therapeutic approaches for the treatment of disease."
10918128,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that primarily affects women and
is characterized by a loss of self-tolerance and expansion of autoreactive B and T lymphocytes, leading to the
production of autoantibodies. The autoantibody production leads to chronic inflammation, resulting in high rates
of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Clinical data indicate that rates of obesity are increased in patients
with SLE, and even in the absence of an overweight or obese BMI, patients with SLE have altered fat deposition
and increased visceral adiposity compared to BMI-matched controls. SLE patients also have elevated circulating
levels of the adipokine leptin, including those patients with a BMI in the normal range. The central goal of this
project is to examine the pathogenic role of obesity and leptin in the development and progression of
SLE disease and the development of hypertension. To accomplish this goal, two clinically relevant models
of SLE, the female NZBWF1 mouse and the pristane-inducible model, will be utilized. Both models develop
hypertension as the disease progresses, and the NZBWF1 mouse exhibits obesity and hyperleptinemia on a
normal chow diet. In aim 1 we will use the NZBWF1 mouse to test the hypothesis that increased visceral
adiposity in SLE exacerbates disease progression and the development of hypertension via pathogenic immune
cells in adipose tissue. We will use surgical and pharmacological techniques to deplete adipose tissue or specific
immune cell populations within the adipose, and then assess the effect of these treatments on SLE disease
progression and the development of hypertension. Published and preliminary data indicate that leptin has effects
on the immune system via both direct effects on immune cells, and indirectly via signaling in the brain. To assess
the role of leptin in SLE disease progression by directly affecting immune cells, aim 2 will utilize the pristane-
inducible model of SLE and test the hypothesis that elevated leptin during SLE promotes disease progression
via direct effects on B and T lymphocytes in peripheral tissues. We will generate mice that lack leptin receptors
on B or T lymphocytes and induce SLE using pristane. In aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that leptin promotes
SLE disease via its actions in the CNS. First, we will induce lupus using pristane in mice that lack leptin receptors
in the CNS (Nestin-Cre x LepRflox/flox). We will also test whether the effects of leptin on autoimmune disease
progression are mediated by the sympathetic nervous system by utilizing adrenergic receptor blockade.
Together, the proposed studies will provide insight into distinct mechanisms whereby obesity and adipokine
dysregulation lead to immune system dysfunction and the development of hypertension in SLE."
10918132,"Primary hypertension is linked with immunological changes, including autoantibody production, that are
consistent with autoimmune underpinnings of hypertension. The innate immune response also has a central role
in the development of autoimmunity; however, the mechanistic contributions of innate immunity to autoimmune
associated hypertension have not been studied. This proposal will examine a novel innate immune feedforward
mechanism that promotes hypertension during systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a disorder that
predominantly affects young women, thus significantly advancing the field towards a better understand of
immune mediated hypertension. We previously showed that an experimental female mouse model of human
SLE exhibits impaired renal vascular function and sodium handling, renal oxidative stress, and hypertension that
is ameliorated by antioxidants. Despite this, little is understood about the cellular sources of reactive oxygen
species or the intracellular pathways that drive changes in renal function during SLE associated hypertension.
The innate immune response has an important role in causing tissue damage during SLE. This proposal will
test the central hypothesis that during SLE there is a feedforward mechanism driving the generation of renal
ROS, leading to impaired renal vascular function and increased tubular sodium reabsorption. This cycle involves
the presence of NETs that increase cell stress signals, including HMGB1, TLR4 mediated mitochondrial
dysfunction, and the production of ROS. Mitochondrial ROS activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, which
perpetuates the cycle by promoting further generation of NETs to induce additional cell stress. This will be tested
in three aims (1) During SLE, NETs promote hypertension by increasing renal ROS that causes impaired renal
vascular and tubular function. (2) During SLE, cell stress proteins (HMGB1) increase mitochondrial ROS
generation leading to NLRP3 inflammasome activation and further NET production through a TLR4 mediated
mechanism. (3) A large data cohort (approximately 32,000) from men and women with SLE will be examined for
relationships between clinical markers of inflammation, immunotherapies, and blood pressure. The proposal
uses widely established models of SLE, an innovative genetic model, state-of-the-art physiological,
pharmacological, and immunological methods, along with a national data base of human clinical data to
rigorously test these aims."
10918133,"More than 1 in 3 women are living with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and many are unaware of the risks.
Hypertension is a major modifiable risk factor for CVD, and ~47% of adults in the US have hypertension. In ~85%
of cases, the cause of hypertension is unknown and only ~50% of patients taking medication achieve blood
pressure control. A critical barrier to limiting premature death from CVD is lack of awareness surrounding the
risks of CVD. Our location in the Southeast of the US will contribute to our impact. The prevalence of
hypertension and obesity are high in GA, MS, and SC, and the prevalence of hypertension and associated risk
is not equal among all populations. The prevalence of hypertension in Black people in the US is among the
highest in the world. The overall goal of ROAR is to transform academic and community understanding of sex
as a biological variable (SABV) in the consideration of hypertension. The ROAR Leadership Administrative Core
(LAC) will provide vital support for all ROAR programmatic activities, investigators, and staff. The goals of
ROAR-LAC are to 1) provide direction, oversight, support, and assessment of the entire ROAR program
including the research projects and career enhancement core, 2) coordinate communication and collaboration
across the three ROAR institutions, and 3) work with the SCORE consortium to maximize our impact, expand
opportunities for trainees, and promote new collaborations in SABV in CVD. ROAR-LAC will monitor, evaluate,
and support to all aspects of the program to ensure our goals are achieved. This will be accomplished through
4 objectives. Objective 1 is to facilitate and coordinate ROAR business operations. ROAR-LAC is responsible
for matters of personnel, coordination, centralization of services, and fiscal management. Objective 2 is to
stimulate communication across ROAR and with the SCORE Consortium. ROAR-LAC bridges the activities of
ROAR with the NIH, Augusta University, the University of South Carolina School of Medicine, and the University
of Mississippi Medical Center. Objective 3 is to organize and coordinate review of ROAR and ROAR activities.
ROAR-LAC will coordinate, develop, and submit assessments and reports across the program, including
organization of program review and peer-review of pilot programs. Objective 4 is to promote and integrate the
consideration of SABV into the research culture of the ROAR institutions and local communities. ROAR-LAC will
help develop a community built around the concept of SABV research and strengthen institutional and inter-
institutional programs through the dissemination of information across ROAR. The impact of ROAR will be to
advance science and training of the next generation of leaders in the consideration of SABV on the development
and progression of CVD, facilitate the development of a range of educational content that will be fully available
to the Consortium, and promote increased community awareness of the importance of cardiovascular health and
BP pressure control. ROAR-LAC will help ensure the success of ROAR by guaranteeing open communication,
administrative support, transparent finances, and strong leadership."
10932163,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The etiology of Barrett's esophagus (BE), a molecularly complex disorder of the distal esophagus, remains
elusive. Patients with BE are at an increased risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), a lethal,
increasingly prevalent, and the most common esophageal malignancy in the U.S. Our long-term objective is to
identify the causative mechanisms underlying the onset and malignant progression of BE, and to develop
evidence-based biomarkers and chemopreventive/therapeutic strategies for subsequent clinical implementation.
Project 3 of this program is based on our recent discovery of EphB2 Receptor Tyrosine Kinase as a novel
promoter of Barrett's neoplasia. RNA sequencing coupled with pathway modeling in treatment-naïve patient
biopsies showed significant hyperactivation of EphB2 signaling in the vast majority (>90%) of BE and EAC
lesions. Phenotypic assessments in vitro and in vivo demonstrated EphB2 signaling to be essential for the
viability of EAC and dysplastic/BE cells. Subsequent mechanistic studies identified c-MYC as a novel target of
EphB2 signaling, while single-cell RNA sequencing of esophageal progenitor cells further confirmed a strong
association of EphB2 activation with columnar/BE-like cell lineage. Collectively, our study implicates EphB2
signaling for the first time in BE-EAC pathogenesis, and further reveals a novel link between EphB2 and MYC in
any disease context. Expanding on these provocative findings, we now propose to fully characterize the biologic
role of EphB2 in Barrett's neoplasia as follows: In Aim 1, we will determine whether EphB2 activation is a
consequence of, or a pre-requisite for, columnar/BE metaplasia development. We will test whether activation of
EphB2 signaling in putative BE-progenitor cells promote columnar/BE-like transformative state. In Aim 2, we will
determine the pathologic consequences of EphB2 activation in vivo in the esophagus, using a constitutively-
active EphB2 kinase (Ephb2F613D) mouse model that we recently developed. We will specifically test if EphB2
activation induces BE-like metaplasia and dysplasia/cancer in the esophagus; either spontaneously, or upon
exposure to reflux injury, and/or in the setting of esophageal inflammation. We will further characterize the key
molecular programs disrupted by EphB2 activation in the esophagus. In Aim 3, we will determine the downstream
and upstream regulatory cascades of EphB2 signaling. Collectively, our proposed studies will delineate the role
of EphB2 signaling for the first time, uncovering novel driver mechanisms of BE-EAC pathogenesis."

Core A: Program Administration
The mission of the Administrative core is to maintain a cohesive program through facilitating interactions
between the three projects and the investigators with the program director. Administrative assistance will be
given to the projects and cores to enable them to function efficiently and seamlessly across the Penn School of
Medicine, the School of Dental Medicine, and the Wistar Institute.
The Administrative core will organize the monthly lab group meetings at which the ongoing research will be
discussed. This core will also be responsible for organizing the Henle symposium, which will be a core part of
this program and provide a mechanism by which we can link this symposium with the external advisory
meetings. Thus, it will also be responsible for organizing all meetings of program leaders and the annual
meetings of the Internal and External advisory committees.
The Administrative core will be the conduit through which communications and materials will be exchanged
with external laboratories. The appropriate permits for transfer of infectious agents (C.D.C., U.S.D.A., and
F.D.A.) will be filed and maintained by the administrative core. All MTAs for the program investigators between
Penn and other institutions will also be handled by the administrative core.
The submission of manuscripts, progress reports, preparation of figures, review of presentations and posters
for meetings will also be expedited by the core."
10928196,"The overarching goal of the current Blackfeet NARCH application is to improve the mental and physical health
of the Blackfeet Nation by developing the Blackfeet Community College (BCC) Center for Culture as Medicine
(CCM). To realize this goal, the BCC-CCM must accomplish the center’s overall aims, which are to perform
interventions informed by our previous research to improve the physical and mental health of the Blackfeet
Nation, generate new results that will inform future interventions responsive to health concerns among the
Blackfeet Nation, and build the capacity of health equity research at BCC by developing the BCC-CCM. To
meet that goal and aims, each of the proposed projects of the BCC-CCM must meet its own specific aims. The
BCC-CCM Administrative Core (AC) will facilitate the accomplishment of individual projects’ aims, thereby
resulting in meeting the center’s overall goal. To this end, the AC’s specific aims are 1. accomplish the
overall aims of the BCC-CCM. The AC will assure that the individual projects are working together efficiently
by continually and carefully monitoring component activities and facilitating communications among them. As
such, the AC is responsible for allocating and overseeing all BCC-CCM resources; establishing and
maintaining partnerships, the Community Advisory Board, and the External Advisory Committee; and arranging
meetings and other activities essential to the success of the BCC-CCM. 2. maintain good relationships with
the Blackfeet community, be responsive to the research interests of the community, and disseminate
research results to the community. We have found that the Blackfeet community is very supportive of
biomedical research at BCC. This support has been best exemplified by the number of community members
participating in past research projects and their pride in research being conducted by Blackfeet people,
especially Blackfeet students. Each of the BCC-CCM projects is responsible for maintaining good
relationships/partnerships with the Blackfeet community, and it is the AC’s responsibility to assure that each
project does so. Recommendations and guidance, from either the BCC-CCM CAB or the individual projects’
CABs must be communicated to all center investigators and heeded. 3. build a sustainable BCC-CCM. The
most impactful result of NARCH funding would be the development of a sustainable Native research center. A
sustained center would have investigators who could improve the health of Blackfeet people and compete
successfully for external funding. We believe the previous BCC NARCH, by funding student and faculty
research development, positioned us to be able to propose the present application. By continuing to publish,
perform impactful interventions, generate published results that can act as preliminary data for future
proposals, and build research capacity, BCC-CCM will indeed become sustainable."
10817948,"Project Summary
The University of Iowa submits this renewal application for continued participation in the NICHD
Neonatal Research Network (RFA-HD-23-002). We seek to continue to support the mission of the NRN
to improve healthcare and outcomes for newborns, seeking solutions to increase survival without
neurodevelopmental impairment or chronic illness for premature and critically ill newborn infants. We
have several strengths that will advance the collaborative work of the NRN.
 1. Our NICU is a world leader in the care of periviable infants, born at 22 and 23 weeks’ gestation.
The survival rate of this population at the University of Iowa is the best in the United States, and the
majority of these survivors are free of neurodevelopmental impairment. We bring expertise to inform
research design as well as a relatively large periviable population available to participate in NRN
studies. Our mortality for extremely low birth weight infants is perennially among the lowest in the NRN.
 2. We have a strong tradition and culture of clinical research in infants. Our clinical research
infrastructure in the NICU has a decades-long track record of successful participation in multicenter
studies and contributions to important neonatal study findings.
 3. Our NICU is the leading US center in the emerging neonatal subspecialty of neonatal
hemodynamics. Our Hemodynamics group has developed the study methods and echocardiographic
measurement standards for this modality and are global experts in its use both clinically and in
physiologic and interventional research. That expertise can be harnessed in the NRN to pursue novel
study designs.
 4. As the only academic medical center in a largely rural state with an economy based in agriculture,
we represent a population that is not otherwise well represented in the NICHD Network. Our partner
site at Sanford Health in Sioux Falls, SD further enhances this diversity with the addition of a Native
American population to our combined rural population. If the results of Network studies are to be
generalized to patients throughout the country, this large area of the country should be represented.
The University of Iowa Network center represents this region and population.
 5. We have contributed significantly to the NRN’s work through the last 7 years. We have been
among the highest enrolling sites in several studies despite our relatively low population, and we have
had excellent follow-up rates for infants both in trials and in the Follow-up observational study."
10840295,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Being born preterm is associated with long-term developmental delays that may not be apparent until well after
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) hospitalization. Researchers have examined the potential effects of being
born preterm and neurodevelopmental outcomes and found that preterm infants have increased motor,
behavioral, and cognitive morbidities when compared to their term counterparts. These risks are increased for
Black/African American infants and male infants. Routine nursing care is a known, even though necessary,
stressor. However, mechanisms linking care to stress responses and sleep states in preterm infants is not fully
understood. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of routine nursing care on stress and sleep
states in preterm infants. The specific aims are to: determine the relationship between routine nurse caregiving
and the post-caregiving stress response among preterm infants; and determine the relationship between
routine nurse caregiving on preterm infants’ post-caregiving behavior state. Secondary aims are to: examine
the relationships among stress and sleep states pre- and post-caregiving; explore the potential moderating
effect of history of stress exposure on effects of routine caregiving on stress response and behavior states
following care; and explore the potential moderating effect of pre-caregiving stress response and behavior
state on the relationship between routine caregiving and stress response and behavior state post-caregiving.
We will consider differences in biological sex and race in all analyses. We propose a non-experimental,
descriptive, observational study of 30 preterm infants born between 28-32 weeks gestational age. We will
observe one nurse caregiving event, recording stress exposures, stress responses, and behavior states.
Stress exposures will be measured using the Neonatal Infant Stressor Scale and data from the electronic
health record. Stress responses will be measured using salivary cortisol and skin conductance response.
Sleep behaviors will be measured using the Anderson Behavioral State Scale. The study findings will increase
our understanding of the effects of routine nurse caregiving on the stress response and sleep behaviors in
preterm infants in the NICU. These findings can lead to improved caregiving practices, thus, improving
neurodevelopmental outcomes. This study aligns with the National Institute of Nursing Research’s strategic
plan for prevention and health promotion by addressing a clinical model of care. The research is an important
step in the development of targeted interventions to optimize neurodevelopmental outcomes for preterm
infants. The training plan will provide numerous formal and informal opportunities for professional development
while allowing building a solid foundation for a successful career as an independent researcher. This study
builds on the applicant’s experiences as a NICU nurse and research assistant and integrates her knowledge of
nursing care delivery, infant and child development, and research methods."
10914853,"Project Summary
During early brain development, GABA is the main excitatory neurotransmitter due to a reverse chloride gradient
mediated via the chloride co-transporter genes NKCC1 and KCC2. Signaling via the nicotinic receptor,
a7nAChR, is a key driver of the GABA excitatory/inhibitory [E/I] shift necessary for normative neurodevelopment.
Dysfunctional maturation of GABAergic neurotransmission and E/I balance in the brain is implicated in the
pathogenesis of several neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including autism spectrum disorder (ASDs).
Recently, our studies have identified a functional polymorphism in the Neuregulin 1 gene promoter, rs6994992,
which is associated with elevated brain transcription of a novel NRG1 isoform, (NRG1-IV) and more critically
lower levels of α7nAChR in the human brain. Signaling via the α7nAChR is a critical driver of the GABA
excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) shift, mediated via the chloride transporters, NKCC1 and KCC2 and is also a known
genetic risk factor for several NDDs, especially ASD, in the form of 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome. In rodents,
α7nAChR knockdown prevents the switch, resulting in aberrant maturation of GABAergic hyperpolarization and
NRG1 is a key regulator of α7nAChRs; the specific role of NRG1-IV is unknown. In human studies, rs6994992
is associated with human cognition, sensory processing and anxiety behaviors, and data from our lab suggest
attenuated sensory processing in babies carrying the T allele, and an interaction with maternal gestational dietary
choline supplementation. Choline is a α7nAChR agonist, and a novel prenatal nutrient supplementation strategy
shown to improve childhood behaviors and early brain development. In summary, the objective of this
multidisciplinary proposal is the developmental characterization of a novel biological pathway linking NRG1,
α7nAChR and NKCC1/KCC2 with regulation of E/I balance maturation, using a novel transgenic mouse (NRG1-
IVtgNSE-tTA) genetically modified to express human NRG1-IV in brain and cutting-edge experimental
approaches. We will test two main hypotheses.1). NRG1-IV overexpression contributes to atypical maturation of
neocortical GABAergic signaling and E/I cortical balance, mediated via reduced α7nAChR and developmental
expression of the chloride co-transporters NKCC1 and KCC2 and 2). Prenatal stimulation of α7nAChR, via
dietary choline supplementation, will correct development of the switch, improve adult E/I cortical imbalance and
neurobehavioral outcomes relevant to several NDDs, mechanistically via a7nAChR. This research will improve
our knowledge of basic mechanisms of typical and atypical development related to a key signaling pathways
involved in several NDDs, especially ASD, and identify new treatment/intervention approaches for people with
developmental disabilities."

 A gene cluster is a group of two or more homologous genes arranged within a certain genomic range. These
gene clusters are widespread in genomes across species. They account for 22% and 18% of annotated genes
in mice and humans, respectively. A gene family usually contains multiple gene clusters located on different
chromosomes. Therefore, studying the regulation of gene clusters adds a new layer on top of traditional tran-
scriptional regulation. Studies on the Keratin, Hox, Globin, Olfactory-Receptor, and other gene clusters revealed
distinct epigenetic and topological states that contribute to differential transcriptional outcomes. The knowledge
gaps in the field are: (i) missing detailed mechanistic machinery that constitutes specific epigenetic and topolog-
ical domains on a gene cluster, (ii) is there general interchromosomal crosstalk of multiplex gene clusters in the
same gene family, and (iii) what protein modules spatially organize gene clusters in the cell nucleus and facilitate
their coordination. The proposed research seeks to decompose (a) epigenetic principles of gene clusters with
distinct expression patterns, (b) molecular mechanisms that configure intra- and inter-cluster conformations, and
(c) protein cascades that organize gene clusters within sub-nuclear structures. We will utilize the multiplex Ker-
atin gene clusters as a paradigm in the biological context of avian skin development. Since gene clusters are
widespread in genomes and used in novel development and organ morphogenesis, misexpression or mutation
of clustered genes contributes to abnormal development and diseases. The proposed research will provide a
fundamental understanding of complex gene regulation. It will also extend our previous insights of localized gene
regulation to how spatial subnuclear compartmentation facilitates transcriptional heterogeneity of compound
genes during tissue development and homeostasis."
10908450,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), which includes alcohol-associated cirrhosis (AAC) and alcohol-
associated hepatitis (AH), is now the leading indication for liver transplant (LT) in the US. Early LT (eLT),
defined as LT evaluation with <6 months of alcohol abstinence, is associated with acceptable outcomes for AH
in retrospective studies. However, prospective, multi-center data including biopsychosocial factors on eLT for
all advanced ALD in racially, culturally, and socioeconomically diverse populations are lacking. It is known that
alcohol cessation is the most important factor influencing survival in ALD, and integrated alcohol use disorder
(AUD)/ALD care is critical to help patients achieve abstinence, yet the degree of care integration and how this
influences post-LT outcomes has not been systematically studied. Knowledge gaps in eLT for ALD include: a)
limited data on who gets referred for eLT and referral barriers; b) lack of standardized biopsychosocial
measures and outcomes; and c) minimal stakeholder involvement beyond LT providers. There is an urgent
need to (1) define factors influencing eLT referral, (2) develop risk prediction models of key patient-centered
outcomes, (3) incorporate validated biopsychosocial measures into models, and (4) evaluate the impact of
integrated care on outcomes following eLT. For example, The INTEGRATE collaborative, comprised of
diverse, multidisciplinary clinicians and researchers from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center,
University of Michigan, University of Miami, and Columbia University-Weill Cornell Medicine, is ideally
positioned to address these urgent research needs. Collectively, we have developed a distinctive investigator
team with diversity in: (1) career stage (2) sex and race/ethnicity, (3) clinical and methodological expertise in
ALD, AUD, LT, behavioral research, risk modeling, data harmonization, health disparities, causal inference,
and mixed-methods research, and (4) documented track record of NIH funding in LT access, organ allocation,
LT outcomes and healthcare disparities, and NIAAA funding in ALD/AUD. Our large volume transplant centers
with established protocols for eLT for ALD applied to highly diverse populations will facilitate the following aims:
1) characterize and develop risk prediction models for transplant-free survival among those with limited access
to LT to define those in greatest need of eLT referral and listing; 2) evaluate barriers and facilitators to referral
for eLT in ALD; 3) apply causal inference approaches to observational data to evaluate biopsychosocial factors
and develop risk models predictive of outcomes at key timepoints in eLT for ALD; 4) define stakeholder
perceptions and preferences for selection and outcomes in eLT for ALD; and 5) evaluate how integrated care
processes influence outcomes in eLT for ALD. At the conclusion of this work, we will have collaboratively: (1)
defined factors for referral and waitlisting for eLT in ALD (selection), (2) identified which biopsychosocial
factors are causally related and predictive of outcomes most important to stakeholders (outcomes) and (3)
determined how integrated care influences stakeholder-relevant outcomes in eLT for ALD (management)."
10911959,"Melanin is the key determinant of human pigmentation that has evolved under natural selection and has led to
diversification of human skin color. Importantly, the number of melanin-producing-melanocytes and their
anatomical location do not vary among humans, only varying melanogenesis determines the human
pigmentation diversity. Our long-term goal is to build a comprehensive understanding of the epigenetic and
transcriptional machinery that dictate precise human melanogenesis gene expression programs that governs
normal-range human pigmentation variation and disease susceptibility. The key insights about human
melanogenesis have come from mapping genes involved in hypo- and hyper pigmentation diseases, Genome-
wide Association Studies (GWAS) of normal-range skin and hair color variation in human populations and genetic
studies on mouse coat color. Nonetheless, current genetic knowledge can explain only a fraction of skin color
variation in humans suggesting that many loci controlling pigmentation remain unknown. By conducting a
genome-wide CRISPR screen, PI has uncovered novel candidate genes driving human pigmentation. Among
the novel pigmentation genes identified, we found that KLF transcription factors are differentially expressed in
light and dark colored human melanocytes and play an antagonistic role in melanogenesis in a gene dosage
dependent manner. We will investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of these closely related factors
to understand their roles in human pigmentation variation. Consistent with other human phenotypes, we
hypothesize that most DNA variants driving normal-range human pigmentation and skin disease susceptibility
may lie in non-protein-coding regions of genome. We will map the cis-regulatory landscape of melanocytes from
diverse color humans by performing unbiased epigenomic profiling to uncover putative enhancers with divergent
gene regulatory activity. We will prioritize the candidate divergent enhancers for functional analysis by focusing
on loci that have either previously been associated with skin color GWAS studies or overlap with novel
melanogenesis genes identified by our genome-wide genetic screen. Through genetic perturbation studies we
will confirm whether cis-regulatory changes affect gene expression quantitatively. Building on PI’s postdoctoral
work, over the next five years, the lab will combine diverse approaches to understand the genotype-to-phenotype
connection in human skin pigmentation variation. These approaches include pluripotent stem cell differentiation
models that recapitulate human melanogenesis in vitro, genome-engineering, massively parallel reporter assays,
single-cell profiling methods, quantitative melanin measurements, and validation experiments in transgenic
mouse models. Through our studies on a highly quantifiable trait such as melanin, we will provide insights into
how genotypic variation encoded in genome give rise to differences in gene expression and leads to phenotypic
divergence within human species, which has implication for human development, health and disease."

generation of scientist-educators by creating an innovative postdoctoral training model and (2) to
encourage undergraduates underrepresented in research to consider careers in biomedical
sciences. The success of INSPIRE is evident in that (1) 74% of INSPIRE Fellows have obtained
academic positions after research training at Rutgers laboratories and mentored teaching at our
partner institutions, Medgar Evers College – CUNY, New Jersey City University, NJ and William
Paterson University, NJ, three institutions that educate students underrepresented in biomedical
research; and (2) INSPIRE has promoted improved and new science courses, Scientific Teaching
training by partner school faculty, and increased research experiences for the undergraduates at
partner schools. To increase the impact of INSPIRE the program will add a 4th year of formal
training for the Fellows, and will expand mentoring programs for the partner school students.
The proposed INSPIRE IRACDA program will include 3 years of funded postdoctoral training
program for 5 trainees per year, with a 4th year of training to be supported by the Rutgers
Research Mentors. Some INSPIRE Fellows will be recruited to become Rutgers faculty, as
Rutgers Presidential Postdoctoral Fellows, a program to build Rutgers faculty diversity. Trainees
will participate in mentored research in Rutgers laboratories; a structured career development
program; a structured educational component including intensive training in scientific teaching
during year 1; and mentored teaching and course development at partner schools during years 2
and 3, and focused training in academic writing in year 4. The program will promote research
and teaching interactions between partner school students and faculty with faculty and
postdoctoral trainees at a research-intensive university. Program evaluation will measure (a)
undergraduate student application and entry into research programs and awareness of research
careers; (b) curriculum development at partner schools of 4 science courses to increase student
engagement in STEM courses; (c) research collaborations between Rutgers and its partner
schools facilitated by ongoing summer research by partner school undergraduates at Rutgers,
supervised by the Fellows and (d) entry of 70% of INSPIRE postdocs, including underrepresented
trainees, into education/research careers, including becoming Rutgers research faculty."

The central goal of the Career Enhancement Program (CEP) is to use the resources at MD Anderson to train
exceptional young investigators who will reduce the morbidity and mortality from ovarian cancer by making
advances in the early detection, prevention, and treatment of this disease. To achieve this goal, the SPORE
CEP will provide two awards, each of $50,000 annually for up to two years, funded from the SPORE and
matching funds from MD Anderson. The intent of each CEP award is to prepare the selected scientists to become
international leaders in academic research relevant to ovarian cancer. We will achieve this through focused
recruitment of a diverse cadre of promising young investigators. We will work in partnership with awardees to
generate individualized development plan and provide them with outstanding clinical and a laboratory mentors
and a mentoring committee, formal course work, coaching in grant and paper writing, leadership training,
attendance at national meetings, networking with ovarian cancer scholars and completing and publishing a
translational ovarian cancer research program. Over the past two decades, the Ovarian Cancer SPORE CEP
has developed the careers of 27 young investigators. In the first year of the original grant, three postdoctoral
trainees received CEP awards, and of the 24 faculty members supported since 2000, all but two have remained
in academic research and 13 are engaged predominantly in ovarian cancer research. Seventeen have achieved
federal peer-reviewed funding and five additional awardees have received competitive foundation grants. Three
awardees from our 2017-2021 funded cycle have received two Ovarian Cancer Research Alliance (OCRA)
Awards, one CPRIT award, one R01, one R21, and one U01. Since the inception of the program in 1999, our
CEP awardees have published over 1,100 peer-reviewed papers regarding ovarian cancer."
10911246,"Project Summary
Targeted protein degradation (TPD) is an emerging therapeutic modality with the potential to overcome
limitations of traditional pharmacological inhibition approaches. TPD uses small molecules (degraders) to hijack
the cellular degradation machinery by recruiting E3 ubiquitin ligases to proteins of interest (POI), which would
not otherwise be recognized as substrate. Despite the tremendous promise of TPD approach, major bottlenecks
still exist, including: 1) ligand discovery against undruggable disease-causing proteins. 2) a dearth of available
E3 ligase recruiters that can be exploited for TPD applications, as there are limited number of E3 ligases, with
most of the published degraders using ligands for cereblon and VHL, despite the existence of >600 E3 ligases
in the human genome. Therefore, it is a great deal of interest in the discovering of new E3 ligase ligands to
expand the scope of new therapeutics. Recently, several research groups discovered cysteine-reactive covalent
recruiters against previously untargeted E3 ligases that have been successfully used in TPD by using chemical
proteomic approaches. While targeting cysteines serves as a useful starting point, there is a need to consider
other types of chemistry to generate covalent E3 recruiters for targeting new E3 ligases to expand the scope of
TPD. One such possibility is to target potential nucleophilic residue, such as lysine, tyrosine, and serine on E3
ligases, respectively. However, specific biocompatible electrophiles targeting lysines, tyrosine, and serine are
largely unexplored for TPD application. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to design, synthesize and validate
new E3 ligases ligands that enable the development of novel degraders. To achieve this, we will use a
chemoproteomic strategy that leverages broadly reactive, lysine, tyrosine, and serine-directed electrophilic
warheads coupled to selective ligands for intracellular proteins (JQ1 for BRD4 or SLF for FKBP12) to screen for
heterobifunctional degrader compounds that operate by covalent adduction of E3 ligases. To this end, we have
already succeeded in developing a series of compounds to promote ligand-induced protein degradation. These
proof-of-concept degraders led to the induced ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of target proteins. We
will perform further chemoproteomic studies to identify the E3 ligase targets of these degraders responsible for
the degradation activity. With our novel approaches, we expect to see the repertoire of E3 ligases recruited for
targeted protein degradation to be further enriched, paving the way for the next generation of tissue- and disease-
specific molecular degraders."

on highly integrated protein networks to provide surveillance and ensure proteins do not become susceptible to
aggregation, a driver of human neurological diseases and cancers. Paramount to these networks are molecular
chaperones and their regulators, which assist in protein folding, transport, and degradation. As the diversity of
proteins that require these chaperones increases, we have gained a broader understanding of the importance
of these regulators across many cellular processes. Recently, we discovered molecular chaperones also
influence cell metabolism by acting on key metabolic enzymes within glycolysis and purine biosynthesis to
efficiently produce the necessary biomolecules critical for their survival and proliferation. However, our
knowledge of how chaperones recognize and act on these enzymes remains largely elusive. The proposed
studies combine super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, biochemical and molecular biology tools, and
proteomic analyses to investigate the how chaperones regulate commonly observed phenomena across
metabolic pathways including the formation of phase separated metabolic enzyme assemblies to facilitate
substrate channeling, the folding of large multi-domain enzymes to drive tightly coupled activities, and the
induced degradation of metabolic enzymes by chaperone-mediated autophagy. These findings will deepen our
fundamental understanding of how cells respond to changes in nutrient availability to meet biomass demand,
provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of dysregulation that drive disease, and inspire new therapeutic
strategies targeting cell metabolism."
10929992,"Project Summary
We will design and develop a molecular simulation data management system, we call P2DMS, to analyze large dis-
tributed molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data. The salient features of the system include: (1) a push-based local
query engine design that handles data in a batch processing manner and processes many queries at the same time;
(2) optimized MD analytics tools using modern many-core hardware such as GPUs; and (3) efﬁcient management and
access to distributed data over wide area networks, which is quite common for large scale MD simulations. This will
be done by building a data analysis layer on top of state-of-the-art distributed big data management systems. The out-
come of this project will not only improve the efﬁciency of MD data processing, but also enable new knowledge discov-
ery that is currently regarded difﬁcult or infeasible. In particular, we will integrate the P2DMS program into existing MD
simulation packages, and validate the new design with important real-world biological and MD methodological prob-
lems. In particular, we will (1) model the structure-function relationships of how the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 inter-
acts with the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor; and (2) enhance the performance of a recently
developed parameter optimization software for active control of MD simulations."

Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in children is a tragic event that usually results in death or permanent
brain injury in survivors. More than 7000 children suffer OHCA each year in the US and improvements in
pediatric OHCA outcomes, just as in adults, is very much limited by our ability to protect the brain from global
cerebral ischemic injury in those who are successfully resuscitated. Targeted temperature management (TTM)
is currently guideline-recommended in children following OHCA with preference stated for therapeutic
hypothermia (TTM 32-34°C) over normothermia (TTM 36-37.5°C) in order to prevent fever which could amplify
brain injury. The optimal duration and patient selection criteria for therapeutic hypothermia in children remain
unknown and cooling devices are not specifically FDA approved for this indication. Preclinical data and
mechanistic studies strongly suggest that durations of hypothermia longer than those typically used in adults
may minimize brain injury. This study will determine if identifying an optimal duration (dose) of therapeutic
hypothermia can improve outcomes, and if development of a duration response curve can confirm efficacy in a
wider pediatric population of OHCA survivors. We hypothesize that longer durations of cooling will improve
survival and result in better neurologic recovery in survivors compared to shorter cooling durations, as
assessed by the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales–Third Edition (Vineland-3) score. The primary goal of this
project is to identify clinical strategies that will increase the number of patients with improved neurological
recovery from OHCA. The results of this trial will be extremely significant in children and will immediately
impact both clinical practice and regulatory evaluation. The Pediatric Influence of Cooling duration on Efficacy
in Cardiac Arrest Patients (P-ICECAP) trial, modeled after the ongoing adult ICECAP trial, uses innovative
adaptive dose finding methods that allow exploration of a wide range of potential durations and efficiently
allocate subjects where they will be most informative. The study will be conducted using resources of the
NHLBI/NINDS Strategies to Innovate Emergency Care Clinical Trials Network (SIREN), which is experienced
in both pediatric and adult trials, and is currently conducting the current adult ICECAP Trial. SIREN leverages
existing resources to achieve economies of scale and to conduct important clinical investigations spanning
from pre-hospital, through both the emergency department and ICU stay, and post hospital discharge."

CHEMICAL SYNTHESIS SHARED RESOURCE - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Chemical Synthesis Shared Resource (CSSR) enables novel chemical synthesis to MECC researchers who
do not have the facility to create novel molecules in their own laboratories. In this role, the CSSR offers a broad
spectrum of chemical synthesis, medicinal chemistry, computational chemistry, analytical chemistry, chemical
reactivity and chemical identification services for unknowns. CSSR provides consulting and project planning with
a particular focus on project planning for research grant applications. Data evaluation for the use of CSSR
compounds, editing and publishing support is provided as part of the service to members of the MECC. CSSR
is equipped with state-of-the-art instrumentation to perform complex chemical reactions including, low
temperature, photochemical, chiral synthesis, organometallics, carbohydrates, peptides, pressure reactions,
isotopic labeling, and microwave-stimulated chemistry. CSSR services in chemical synthesis are custom-tailored
to solutions for each MECC investigator. From simple reagent synthesis of a reference compound to
collaboration throughout an entire project, CSSR provides chemical validation from the grant application to the
published work. All chemical needs and problems are addressed on the level of the individual investigator.
The main specific aims are as follows:
Aim 1. Provide high quality chemical synthesis expertise to MECC researchers by planned interactions between
MECC researchers and resource personnel.
Aim 2. Provide expert project-related chemistry for grant and proposals and publications.
Aim 3. Develop and expand ligand screening capacity for novel targets of the MECC research community. Curate
and expand, as needed, the click-chemistry (Copper catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition, SuFEx) library within
the CSSR for use in novel cancer targets. Develop screening protocols and reagents for applying the new
technology of SuFEx targeting discovery. Incorporate computational virtual screening as leads to new chemical
compound synthetic targets within the CSSR.

GENOMICS SHARED RESOURCE - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Genomics Shared Resource (GSR) integrates our legacy Genomics, Epigenomics, Computational
Genomics and Molecular Cytogenetics core facilities. As a result of this integration, we have combined the
activities and expertise of individuals in core facilities performing closely related work into a unified entity that
enhances efficiency and quality of services so that cancer researchers can hand off samples to core personnel
and receive analyzed data, providing a complete workflow housed in a single facility.
 The GSR is now implementing long-read sequencing services in addition to short-read services. When
appropriate, we facilitate outsourcing of short-read sequencing to low-cost commercial providers. However, we
have recently purchased the Illumina NextSeq 2000 platform that upgrades our short read sequencing
capabilities. This investment anticipates a substantial drop in reagent costs in the next 1-2 years and migration
of some of the currently outsourced sequencing back into the GSR.
 The GSR has also been proactive in optimizing new single cell assays for researchers with a current focus on
single cell RNA-sequencing and chromatin assays as well as spatial transcriptomics of tissue sections. Cost
savings through multiplexing for single cell experiments on the 10X Chromium platform has been used to make
these assays substantially more cost-efficient, while reducing batch effects. Single cell sequencing combined
with cell surface marker studies are being provided using the Mission Bio Tapestri platform, which is a foundation
for ongoing clonal hematopoiesis research. We have increased our focus on collecting genomics data as a
resource within the GSR. Our new institutional arrangement with Caris Life Sciences to perform exome and
transcriptome sequencing on our Bronx cancer patients is accompanied by a research protocol to allow the
primary sequence data to be returned to our FISMA-compliant data storage and computing resource. These data
are made available under defined IRB protocols for researchers, to gain insights into the genomic events
occurring in the ancestrally diverse, socioeconomically disadvantaged communities of the Bronx.
 Our goals for the next funding period will be to continue to support MECC researchers in their genomic assays
and data analyses. We are continuing to develop and support new assays, to invest in new equipment, and to
help analyze data generated in the GSR. Investigators are encouraged to contact the leaders of the GSR and
Biostatistics colleagues to discuss study design before initiating a project. For data analytical services, we will
continue to train lab personnel to process data independently and can troubleshoot problems with researchers.
Finally, a new goal is to tailor our services so that they allow insights into cancer genomics in the ancestrally-
diverse Bronx population, with the goal that GSR can help foster health equity and precision medicine for all.

10925245,"ABSTRACT – PROJECT 3
By definition, when patients develop brain metastasis (BM) from their systemic cancer, they become stage IV
and their prognosis drops to under a year. While the mechanism behind brain-tropism of different tumors (Project
1) and the role of resident immune cells in supporting brain metastasis (Project 2) need to be elucidated, there
is also a gap in our understanding of how brain tumors represent an inflection point in patient survival and anti-
tumor response. We have previously observed evidence of intracranial metastases dampening the immune
response mounted by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Understanding the mechanism by which tumor-associated
macrophages (TAMs) recruited to BMs exert said immunosuppression is crucial for the successful treatment of
brain metastasis. We propose to study the role of TAMs in dampening T cell priming via a TGF-β mediated
pathway. We hypothesize that TGF-β released by TAMs in the BM act at the level of the draining lymph nodes
to induce global immunosuppression. We believe that blockade of TGF-β at the lymph nodes will augment an
antitumor immune response induced by checkpoint-blockade or vaccination strategies (such as with induced
pluripotent stem cells or iPSCs). To test our hypothesis, we will investigate the: i) migration of TAMs to BMs and
tumor draining lymph nodes and its effects on T cell priming, ii) role of TGF-β secreted by the TAMs in mediating
said immunosuppression at the level of the draining lymph nodes, and iii) synergy of inhibiting TGF-β signaling
and iPSC vaccines to treat BMs. We expect that the data generated from these studies will provide novel insights
into a previously unexplored mechanism by which BM-infiltrating TAMs exert systemic immunosuppression and
open new avenues for the design of future therapeutic strategies to treat patients with brain metastasis."

10893492,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Biologic drugs have transformed the treatments of a variety of diseases, including diabetes, cancer, and heart
disease. However, their large size prevents them from easily diffusing into targeted tissues when administered
orally or via subcutaneous injection. For example, gastrointestinal mucosal tissue, myocardial muscle tissue and
solid tumor tissue are so densely packed that macromolecules can barely penetrate hundreds of micrometers
into the tissue from an implanted drug depot or leaky blood vessel. This prevents drugs, such as cytokines that
have been demonstrated to promote wound healing in models of myocardial infarction, from reaching the
impacted tissue areas where they could provide therapeutic effects. Even though local administration of drugs
is becoming increasingly necessary to provide therapeutic efficacy, no research or tools exist on understanding
the flow of fluid into tissue. Instead, healthcare professionals inject drugs manually with varying flow rates and
pressures, leading to inconsistent care and potentially devastating consequences. Delivering too much drug too
quickly may dislodge cancer cells in a solid tumor, promoting their circulation and generation of additional
metastases. It may also cause drug to leak out of the solid tumor, generating systemic uptake and off-target
effects. Delivering too slowly, on the other hand, may generate a depot profile where the distance between the
drug and the impacted tissue is greater than the length that the drug can readily diffuse. This proposal will focus
on developing an injection system for healthcare professionals to perform standardized and automated internal
tissue injections. Injecting at flow rates optimized to the mechanical and physiological properties of the tissue
will allow for greater drug distributions while preventing the off-target side effects and tissue damage generated
from overpowered injections. Success of this proposal will yield (1) a computational model capable of predicting
drug distributions in heart and solid tumor tissue at various injection characteristics as well as (2) a clinically
translatable injection system that optimizes and standardizes injections of wound healing drugs and
immunotherapies into these tissues, respectively."
10988224,"Project Summary/Abstract
Iron is an essential trace mineral involved in vital cellular and systemic functions. Humans and other
vertebrates require a sufficient iron supply to carry out essential metabolic functions and oxygen transport
while maintaining homeostatic iron levels to prevent iron toxicity. Organismal iron content is controlled by
dietary absorption, iron partitioning in erythrocytes, iron recycling by macrophages, and iron storage in
hepatocytes. Precise machinery has evolved to conserve iron stores and regulate iron delivery to tissues. A
critical member of this system is hepcidin, a liver-derived peptide hormone. Hepcidin is a master regulator of
systemic iron homeostasis through its ability to negatively regulate ferroportin, the sole known mammalian
iron-exporter in the cell. Hepcidin synthesis is activated physiologically by elevated serum iron level and
pathologically by inflammation and infection. Hepcidin expression is repressed by increased erythropoietic
demand. Heparan sulfate (HS), a prominent glycan part of the cell glycocalyx, was recently established as a
critical component of hepcidin regulation. Inhibition of HS biosynthesis in hepatoma cells, primary human
hepatocytes, and mice reduced baseline and stimulated hepcidin expression and worsened the
pathophysiology characteristic of anemia of inflammation. Preliminary studies have identified Syndecan-1
(SDC-1), the primary heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) in the liver, as a novel cell surface receptor
involved in hepcidin regulation. Genetic and pharmacological inactivation of SDC-1 demonstrated that
hepcidin expression is SDC-1-dependent in human hepatoma models. However, its precise mode of action
remains to be elucidated. The proposed study will (i) validate SDC-1 as the key HSPG that regulates basal
and inducible hepcidin expression, identifying a novel arm of iron homeostasis modulation, (ii) elucidate the
mechanism by which SDC-1 regulates hepcidin in vitro which can provide novel insights into the control of
iron homeostasis and (iii) use in vivo liver-specific SDC-1 inactivation to study the impact of SDC-1
depletion and structural alteration on systemic iron homeostasis. The overarching goal of this proposal is to
evaluate the relationship of Syndecan-1 structure to iron metabolism, with the long-range goal of defining
new potential targets to reduce the risk of iron-loading disorders, such as hemochromatosis and anemia of
inflammation."
10904869,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Recent years have witnessed a growing appreciation of the role that metabolic reprogramming plays in conferring
growth and survival advantages to tumor cells. Of particular relevance to this proposal is the now widely accepted
notion that pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells depend on macropinocytosis as an amino acid
supply route. By stimulating the uptake of extracellular protein and targeting it for lysosomal degradation, the
macropinocytosis pathway provides cancer cells with a source of protein-derived amino acids, allowing tumors
to circumvent amino acid depletion and survive nutrient stress. Glutamine is a vital nutrient to tumors as it
supports the metabolic reactions necessary to sustain tumor cell growth; however, hearty consumption by the
tumor often leads to a glutamine-depleted tumor ecosystem. Our previously funded research demonstrated that
glutamine depletion in PDAC tumors has the capacity to modulate macropinocytosis – dialing the process up or
down as required. We attributed this inducible form of macropinocytic uptake to the activation of EGFR-Pak
signaling. Interestingly, we have found that macropinocytosis is also induced by a glutamine structural analog
that broadly suppresses glutamine metabolism; however, uptake in this setting does not employ EGFR signaling.
Since the inhibition of glutamine metabolism is being actively pursued as a therapy for cancer, we set out to
decipher how glutamine mimicry might elicit macropinocytosis as an adaptive response. We performed a high-
throughput siRNA screen and identified the atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) subfamily of kinases, PKCι and
PKCζ, as the most potent regulators of uptake. This proposal is based on our preliminary data demonstrating
that knockdown of either PKCι or PKCζ not only suppresses macropinocytosis caused by glutamine analogs,
but also abrogates uptake caused by glutamine starvation, suggesting that the aPKCs are general modulators
of nutrient stress-induced macropinocytosis. Based on these data, our central hypothesis is that aPKC signaling
is integral to nutrient stress-driven macropinocytosis and that the aPKCs support metabolic stress tolerance in
PDAC tumors. We will 1) examine the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of aPKCs in nutrient stress-
driven macropinocytosis and 2) determine the functional consequences of suppressing aPKC-dependent
macropinocytosis in PDAC. This project constitutes the first evaluation of the role that the aPKCs play in the
modulation of macropinocytosis and the first to interrogate aPKC function from the perspective of glutamine
supply. Moreover, because our work will establish aPKC-dependent macropinocytosis as a critical metabolic
adaptation in response to glutamine mimetics, our findings could have tremendous impact on the development
of novel therapeutic modalities for PDAC."
10850550,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a deadly, debilitating disease with no cure. The development of
PAH is associated with robust structural remodeling of the small pulmonary arteries, including intimal
thickening and formation of vaso-occlusive lesions. In addition to abnormally increased proliferation of vascular
cells, failure of appropriate apoptosis (i.e., apoptotic resistance) contributes to remodeling via lack of cell
turnover. Our laboratory recently discovered that the expression of the protein-serine kinase, MAPKAP2
(MK2), is markedly downregulated in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) from the
SU5416+hypoxia (SuHx) rat model of PAH. Little is known regarding the control of MK2 expression; however,
our preliminary data indicate that MK2 is regulated by hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), a family of transcription
factors suggested to be involved in the development of PAH. Loss of MK2 is associated with cytosolic
sequestration of caspase-3, preventing apoptosis. Moreover, we linked reduced MK2 levels with upregulation
of the water channel, aquaporin 1 (AQP1), which we previously have shown promotes pro-proliferative effects
in pulmonary vascular cells. However, the mechanism by which MK2 might influence AQP1 expression is
unknown. Based on these data, we hypothesize that in PAH PMVECs, HIF-dependent downregulation of MK2
results in cytosolic sequestering of caspase-3 and upregulation of AQP1, leading to apoptotic resistance and
hyperproliferation, respectively. Thus, the Aims of this study are to: 1) determine whether loss of MK2 during
PAH mediates cytosolic sequestering of caspase-3; 2) determine the mechanism by which MK2 controls AQP1
expression; and 3) evaluate whether increasing the expression of MK2 reverses changes in cell phenotype and
vascular remodeling in PAH. We will use a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach combining in vitro and in
vivo models of PAH to explore the effect of modulating factors in this pathway on PMVEC cell function and
development and reversal of PAH. The successful completion of the proposed studies will impact the field by:
1) describing signaling pathways mediated by MK2 that are involved in the development and progression of
PAH; 2) providing new information regarding regulation of MK2 expression; 3) identifying specific interactions
between caspase-3, MK2 and AQP1 that are responsible for controlling caspase-3 subcellular localization and
AQP1-induced PMVEC growth; and 4) directing subsequent studies aimed at development of new
therapeutics."

Prolonged glucocorticoid use can lead to glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis (GIO) and subsequently increase
fracture risk in as little as three months. Current pharmacological therapies to combat GIO are effective,
however they carry significant side effect profiles and are costly, leading to historically poor adherence rates.
Thus, discovery of novel therapeutics that are cost effective and carry few side effects are both desirable and
necessary. The gut microbiota is known to play an integral role in both the pathogenesis and prevention of GIO
and our lab and others have shown that the gut microbiota is a novel therapeutic target for promoting bone
health. Prunes are the dried form of a natural fruit, plums, and have been shown to benefit bone health in both
pre-clinical and human models of primary osteoporosis, although their mechanism is not well understood. In
preliminary studies, we demonstrate that prunes prevent GIO in mice. Prunes significantly alter the
composition of gut microbiota and are also extensively metabolized by the gut microbiota. Additionally, prunes
are rich in tryptophan which is important in bone health. In additional studies, we found that microbially derived
tryptophan metabolites in the serum positively correlate with bone volume. To date, prunes and their
microbially derived metabolites have not been studied in the context of GIO prevention. The long-term
objective of this project is to establish the mechanistic basis by which prune induced changes in the
gut microbiota composition and correspondingly its tryptophan metabolites prevent GIO.
For this fellowship, I am proposing 2 aims: Aim 1 will demonstrate the critical and direct role of the gut
microbiota in mediating the beneficial effect of dietary prunes in GIO. Sub Aim 1A will examine the role of the
gut microbiota in prunes’ improvement of bone density and prevention of GIO by using a fecal transplant model
(mouse à mouse). To establish translational relevance, Sub Aim 1B will investigate if prunes effect on the
human microbiota are transferable to mice (human à mouse fecal transplant) and improve bone health. Aim 2
will demonstrate if microbially derived tryptophan metabolites from prunes can independently improve bone
density and prevent GIO. Sub Aim 2A will investigate tryptophan metabolites effect on preventing osteoblast
apoptosis and GIO using an in vivo model while sub aim 2B will further investigate their mechanisms in vitro.
This training fellowship will fulfill all aspects of the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health’s
mission to determine the fundamental science, usefulness, and safety of complementary and integrative health
approaches and their role in improving health. Overall, this fellowship will advance mechanistic understanding
of a novel therapeutic approach to combat GIO and have a direct impact on reducing healthcare costs and
improving patient outcomes."

with key roles in the RSR and DDR. Genomic-instability occurs in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome
(WAS), a primary immunodeficiency and cancer susceptibility disorder, yet the molecular
underpinnings of unstable genome in WAS cells remain uncharacterized. WASp, the protein
deficient in this disorder, functions both in the cytoplasm and nucleus. In the nucleus, WASp
functions to prevent the accumulation of harmful R loops (RNA-DNA hybrids + ssDNA) and in the
pre-repair step of escorting broken DNA ends to the repair sites by the homology-directed repair
(HDR) pathway. Accordingly, WAS patient lymphocytes are poorly-equipped to both prevent and
resolve DNA damage, which proposes WAS as a “genotoxin-sensitive” immune dysregulation
disorder. Our foundational studies have uncovered an essential role of WASp in the RSR by
influencing RPA functions under hydroxyurea-induced replication stress, in both immune and
nonimmune cells. Therefore, the overall objective of this proposal is to explicate the molecular
details of how WASp safeguards normal replication and which proteins and pathways WASp
associates with to enable this function during replicative stress. We will test the hypothesis that
WASp is required to both prevent and manage replication stress and DNA damage. Specifically,
we will define WASp role in mechanisms that process a blocked replication fork (in Aim 1) and
address how WASp role specifically on modifying the actin state (G-actin vs. F-actin) influence
RSR (in Aim 2). Achieving these aims will propose WASp as a novel RSR factor, and human
WAS as a disease of dysfunctional RSR, which may provide new mechanisms for oncogenesis
in WAS."

 Effective management of patients with chronic low back pain requires accurate and reliable methods to
measure the effects of treatment on both pain and function. Yet this presents a serious dilemma to clinicians,
who must currently rely exclusively on retrospective self-report measures (e.g., questionnaires) to capture this
information. These assessments are usually only completed each time the patient returns to the clinic, thus
placing an over-reliance on patients' memories and potentially missing critical inflection points in symptom or
functional trajectories. The combination of potentially biased and unreliable reporting makes this method of
assessment far from optimal.
 We recently completed the NIH I-Corps program that revealed pain specialists are in urgent need of
objective data on patient functioning to guide treatment decisions. The physicians we interviewed indicated that
quantitative assessment of activity levels, or actigraphy, may provide a solution because it is a validated
clinical research tool for assessing pain-related disability/function and response to treatment. The hurdles
faced by existing commercial and research devices, however, have prevented the implementation of
actigraphy for routine clinical care due to the technological burden for patients and clinicians (e.g., device
charging, Bluetooth/Wi-Fi pairing, required apps, syncing, analysis software), cost, and the lack of
standardization in device quality and data output.
 Therefore, we propose to commercialize a new class of clinical-grade wearable activity monitor, called
the Vera Band, designed specially to be integrated into healthcare workflows. The Vera Band will provide a
low-profile, durable, ultra-low-cost wearable and supporting service that presents no technical burden to
patients or clinicians and can collect accurate daily activity data. Phase I of this Fast-Track application will
consist of both Aims 1 and 2, each 1-year in duration. We will first conduct an iterative technical design and
laboratory verification process, along with establishing the required technical and regulatory infrastructure to
provide the proposed service (Aim 1). We will then assess its usability and workflow integration and verify its
technical equivalence against a leading FDA-approved actigraphy monitor used in clinical research (Aim 2). By
the conclusion of Aim 2, we propose to obtain FDA 510(k) clearance. During Phase II, we will conduct a multi-
center clinical study, across four tertiary pain clinics, over a period of 3-years to determine physician
satisfaction with device usability, and likelihood of clinical adoption (Aim 3)."

Ovarian cancer (OvCa) has the third highest mortality to incidence ratio and is the fifth leading cause of cancer
death in American women. The typical disease course of a patient with OvCa spans four and a half years from
the time of diagnosis to death. During the course of patient care, acquired and innate resistance to our most
effective and promising therapies, such as chemotherapy, PARP inhibitor therapy, and immunotherapy, drives
disease progression. The overall goal of the UPMC Hillman Cancer Center (HCC) OvCa SPORE is to prevent
and/or overcome therapeutic resistance to improve patient survival. Each of the SPORE’s three Projects
evolved from the innovative concepts and findings of SPORE investigators. Each project involves a clinical trial
with a new agent. In addition, each project, through complementary investigator expertise, incorporates critical
translational aims to identify patients most likely to respond to therapy. Project 1 will assess the ability of
inhibitors of the epigenetic regulator EZH2 to prevent/overcome OvCa stromal progenitor cell-driven resistance
to platinum-based chemotherapy. Project 2 will determine whether BET inhibitors, which downregulate critical
DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint proteins, can reverse resistance to PARP inhibitors. Project 3 will test
whether inhibitors of the hedgehog signaling pathway, which drives tumor immune exclusion, can improve
OvCa patient response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. The HCC OvCa SPORE will include a Career
Enhancement Program (CEP) and Developmental Research Program (DRP) in order to both encourage early
career investigators to enter the field of translational OvCa research and engage more established
investigators in OvCa research. The CEP and the DRP, which are cost-shared and proactive at providing
research funding to investigators from under-represented minority groups, will provide a pipeline of potential
future SPORE Projects. All SPORE, CEP, and DRP Projects will be receive fiscal and scientific oversight from
an Administrative Core and support from two shared resource cores. The Translational Pathology Core will
collect, annotate, archive, and distribute biospecimens and clinical data derived from the more than 300 HCC
OvCa patients seen each year. It will also develop new preclinical experimental models that behave more like
human OvCa. The Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core will aid in design and analysis of all studies, including
‘omic’ technologies that can provide molecular and spatial characterization of individual cells within a tumor.
The SPORE Projects will also be supported by established and new collaborators who are internal and
external to HCC. Combined, the SPORE projects, CEP, DRP, and cores are positioned, together with our
vertical collaborators, to improve the outcomes of patients with ovarian cancer. The findings generated by the
SPORE will be advanced through further collaboration and future non-SPORE funding."

work closely with the NCI Translational Research Program Office. It will provide the administrative framework
through which the SPORE Executive Committee, Internal Advisory Board (IAB), and External Advisory Board
(EAB) can evaluate program activities and will redirect resources, as appropriate, to maximize progress toward
the SPORE’s translational goals. Core A will monitor the budgets of the individual SPORE, CEP, and DRP
Projects and Cores to ensure that no duplication of effort occurs between the SPORE and institutional shared
resources, national consortia or cooperative groups, or other funded research grants. The Core will also
ensure that the SPORE’s research activities are conducted in compliance with all local and federal regulations
and guidelines, including those for protecting the safety and personal health information of patients. Core A will
benefit from the effort of a qualified SPORE Administrator who assists in scheduling and in preparing reports
and manuscripts.
Impact: Through Core A functions, the SPORE as a whole will benefit from the centralization of essential
services, and each SPORE component will be afforded the opportunity to maximize the effort devoted to
research and patient-oriented advances in ovarian cancer."

The long-term goal of the Johns Hopkins Center for Innovative Diagnostics for Infectious Diseases (JH-C[ID]2)
is to accelerate infectious disease diagnostic point-of-care (POC) technology innovation and access to impact
global public health. This is an unprecedented time for infectious disease (ID) diagnostics. The COVID-19
pandemic and the influx of funding from the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADxTech) has stimulated and
accelerated the development of POC SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics. Some of these POC platforms could be used
to detect a wide range of other ID pathogens including STI and other emerging and re-emerging infections with
a relatively small additional investment. The technologic advances of the last decade have also brought new
innovation that could be leveraged for infectious disease diagnostics to create POC or self-tests that could be
cheaper, more robust, and faster. The JH-C[ID]2 has engaged with over 100 companies for STI and SARS-
CoV-2 POC tests (POCT) and has identified common bottlenecks to development to commercialization and
adoption. We have successfully moved several early-stage companies from proof-of-concept to FDA

to SARS-CoV-2 detection as part of RADx Tech and complete development to achieve FDA emergency use
authorization. With our experienced, multi-disciplinary team, the Technology Core has the following aims: 1)
outreach to and calls for proposals from developers at all stages that target unmet need in infectious disease
diagnostics; 2) funding for meritorious proposals with clear milestones and decision points for go/no-go
decisions; 3) integrated evaluation and support from experts to decrease complexity and cost while identifying
risks to success through a systems engineering approach; 4) referral to Clinical Core services and other JH-
C[ID]2 resources to verify performance with clinical samples in the hands of potential users. Over the last 3

public health impact in different global settings."
10928769,"Clinical Core Project Summary
The long-term goal of the Johns Hopkins Center for Innovative Diagnostics for Infectious Diseases (JH-C[ID]2)
is to accelerate infectious disease diagnostic point-of-care (POC) technology innovation and access to impact
global public health. Diagnostic advances in vitro devices (IVD) during the COVID-19 pandemic have propelled
development of point-of-care (POC) platforms for sexually transmitted infections (STI) and other emerging and
re-emerging infectious diseases. The public has embraced self-testing and used it to assess their ‘status’ for
SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, thoughtful evaluation of the performance and implementation of STI POC tests
(POCT) is necessary to avoid losing the gains in patient care and public health provided by well-established,
centralized testing within a healthcare setting. In order to responsibly accelerate the development of POC and
at-home self-tests, companies need access to clinical expertise to refine use case and intended use so that POC
tests are complementary and increase access to diagnostic certainty. Over the last 3 cycles of our POCTRN
Center, developers have valued the JH-C[ID]2 resources including the availability of specific types of samples
and sample formats to validate their technology at all stages of development. We have previously established
clinical sites in diverse, ‘real-world’ settings where POCTs are the most impactful: emergency department (Johns
Hopkins), ambulatory settings for adults (John G. Bartlett Specialty Practice, Baltimore City Health Department
[BCHD]) and adolescents (Cincinnati Children’s Adolescent Clinic), pharmacies, and resource-limited settings
(Infectious Diseases Institute (IDI), Kampala, Uganda). In this U54 cycle, we will be poised to perform pre-clinical
pilots and iterative prospective evaluations of performance to identify IVD that can be successfully
commercialized and adopted by the public, or that need further refinement or removal from the pipeline (go/no-
go decisions). The Core’s experienced Investigators will verify diagnostic performance by evaluating the
technology at Johns Hopkins, serve on the Clinical Review Committee to provide developers’ access to clinical
expertise, enlarge the number of samples available for iterative development, and provide our clinical sites for
pre-clinical pilots. The Clinical Core will: 1) evaluate the diagnostic performance of prototype POC devices for
STIs and emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in intended populations; 2) provide clinical and
regulatory expertise through the Clinical Review Committee; and 3) evaluate acceptability and usability and end-
users test experience and preference for POC tests as well as their feasibility within clinical workflows. As the
oldest and well-established POCTRN Center, our model of POC test development support has led to the FDA
clearance or emergency use authorization of numerous STI and COVID-19 in vitro devices. The JH-C[ID]2 is
well-positioned to continue to catalyze the successful development of POC and self-tests for STIs, as well as
emerging and re-emerging infections."
10918140,"More than 1 in 3 women are living with heart disease and many are unaware of the risks. Hypertension
is a major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), and ~47% of adults in the US have
hypertension. In ~85% of cases, the cause of hypertension is unknown and only ~50% of patients
taking medication achieve blood pressure (BP) control to recommended levels. A critical barrier to
limiting premature death from CVD is lack of awareness surrounding the risks of CVD. The Career
Enhancement Core (CEC) is designed to develop a comprehensive educational platform on SABV in
CVD to increase awareness and education of CVD and the risks of uncontrolled hypertension in women
across the health span through community outreach. The CEC is critical to the success of ROAR. The
goals of the CEC are to develop a foundation for long-term relationships among the research, medical
and lay communities in GA, MS and SC, and bring greater awareness to the risk of CVD in women and
the consideration of SABV in the control of hypertension through education, mentorship, strategic
partnerships, and training of community-engaged researchers. The ROAR-CEC has 3 objectives.
Objective 1 is to develop a culturally diverse research pipeline of biomedical scientists trained in the
field of SABV in CVD. This Objective will provide research career enhancement opportunities in SABV
research, train a diverse scientific workforce, and promote mechanistic studies in SABV at different
career stages. Objective 2 is to establish a community outreach pipeline of scientists trained to
increase awareness of SABV and promote optimal cardiovascular healthcare for men and women.
ROAR-CEC will leverage and strengthen existing community partnerships to engage in outreach to
promote awareness about cardiovascular risk to men and women at local schools, colleges and
HBCUs. Objective 3 is to empower the community to self-monitor and identify barriers to improving
access to healthcare. This will be accomplished through innovative educational materials and
qualitative assessment of barriers. ROAR-CEC takes a comprehensive approach to training and
education in SABV in CVD and increasing community awareness of the risks of CVD. Our
interdisciplinary team is uniquely prepared to address these important issues in at-risk populations in
the Southern US. The impact of ROAR-CEC will be to train the next generation of scientists engaged
in research related to women’s health and SABV, to change common perceptions and biases regarding
women’s health and hypertension risk factors, and support the development of a new, self-aware,
sustainable, and motivated community of researchers, educators, physicians and community members.
ROAR will create synergy that will transform academic, clinical and community awareness of the
importance of cardiovascular health in women."

10893538,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cellular homeostasis is maintained by signaling events that turn on downstream transcription factors to rapidly
activate or repress hundreds of genes. The application of next-generation sequencing technologies and super-
resolution imaging in the past decade has revealed the central role of non-coding regulatory elements called
enhancers in the spatio-temporal control of mammalian gene expression. Recent evidence indicates that acute
signaling events assemble the enhancer-bound transcriptional complex as membraneless compartments known
as condensates. An important question is how these organelles interact with larger nuclear bodies to shape
three-dimensional genome organization and spatial gene control. We have identified three critical challenges
that limit our understanding of spatial gene control. Our research program is focused on solving these challenges
to fill the critical knowledge gaps in signal-induced gene regulation. Challenge 1) Understand how enhancer
communication works. In addition to controlling primary target genes, several pathway-specific enhancers
engage in long-distance interactions. Our data indicate that enhancer hubs facilitate genome-wide coordination
of signaling programs. The prevalence and regulatory features of this mechanism in signal-activated gene
programs are just beginning to be explored. We will use prototypic type I and type II nuclear hormone receptors
to study the role of enhancer hubs in transcription coordination. Challenge 2) Elucidate the interaction of non-
coding genome and disordered proteome in gene control. We have reported that the ligand-induced
enhancer condensates are composed of proteins with intrinsically disordered regions (IDR) and RNAs. Although
a common feature of many transcriptional complexes, the molecular and enzymatic regulation of the assembly,
dissolution, and material properties of transcriptional condensates are largely unknown. We will use single-cell
CRISPR screening strategies, mutational scans, biophysical and genomics assays to identify enzymes
controlling signaling-activated enhancers by modifying the IDR structure. Challenge 3) Unravel the cell
biological basis of the spatial genome organization. The eukaryotic genome is compartmentalized based on
the transcriptional states of the chromatin. Our data indicate that several nuclear architectural structures and
transcriptional condensates act as solid-state anchors to facilitate long-distance enhancer interaction and
organize chromatin architecture. To gain mechanistic insights into the role of common nuclear bodies in genome
organization, we will employ genetic strategies to transiently degrade these organelles and assess the impact
on three-dimensional chromatin structure and enhancer function using imaging and genomics tools. By
addressing these questions at the intersection of non-coding genome, nuclear condensates, and gene
regulation, we will unravel a cell biological basis of spatial gene control. This research will also contribute to
developing innovative research tools to fill the knowledge gaps in the regulatory roles of the non-coding genome
while facilitating the training and mentoring of the next generation of researchers in multidisciplinary science."

We will develop new large-scale dynamic embedding models of network data with a focus on dynamic connec-
tivity matrices from non-stationary multivariate time series obtained from human functional magnetic resonance
images (fMRI). We propose to model brain networks as 2D curved surfaces, where the surface geodesics give
connectivity information. Our approach will bypass the use of parcellations and more accurately evaluate the
evolutionary dynamics of functional brain networks at the voxel level.
 We propose to build dynamically changing functional brain networks from a dataset with 1206 subjects from
the Human Connectome Project (HCP) database containing T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI),
diffusion MRI (dMRI) and task and resting-state functional MRI (fMRI). MRI and dMRI will be used in conjunction
with fMRI in building more reﬁned dynamic connectivity models. Using 243 pairs of twins in the HCP database, we
will determine network phenotypes speciﬁc to behavior, cognition and their genetic associations. This study will
provide the research community with the brain network heritability maps and as well as a versatile open-source
toolbox of algorithms for modeling and visualizing dynamically changing large-scale brain networks."

Withania somnifera, has long been known in Ayurvedic medicine for its medicinal properties. In recent years,
consumption of W. somnifera products has skyrocketed in western cultures where they are now marketed
through retail outlets as dietary supplements, under the common name, Ashwagandha. The NCCIH-sponsored
BENFRA Botanical Dietary Supplements Research Center (U19 AT010829) is currently researching
Ashwagandha, to determine its effects on age-related neurological deterioration. Unlike pharmaceutical drugs
which have an extensive evaluation process prior to public distribution, very little is known regarding how the
complex mixture of chemicals present in Ashwagandha extracts behaves once it is consumed and passes
through the digestive environment. This proposal is innovative because it will evaluate metabolic stability of
Ashwagandha extracts for the first time using in vitro laboratory models simulating the gastrointestinal
environment. The project will also assess which original or modified components are able to pass the intestinal
membrane via passive diffusion, the mechanism by which most compounds enter the circulation from the gut.
The central hypothesis of this research is that the composition of Ashwagandha derived metabolites entering
circulation is markedly different from that of the original extract. This hypothesis will be tested through the
following specific aims: 1. Determine effects of gastrointestinal environments on the metabolite profiles of
Ashwagandha extracts by exposing extracts to simulated gastro-intestinal fluids and enzymes; and 2. Identify
permeabilities of metabolites from Ashwagandha original extracts and digestive incubations using a synthetic
model of the intestinal membrane. We will use a combination of these in vitro model systems, appropriate
controls, and sufficient replicates for robust statistical analyses to standardize these initial investigations. Ultra-
pressure liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry will be used to analyze extracts,
incubates, and diffusion chamber media, to evaluate changes in chemical structures and relative abundances of
Ashwagandha metabolites in these complex matrices for the first time. Results from these studies will provide
insight into a more realistic Ashwagandha metabolic profile post-gastrointestinal digestion that can then be
further studied collaboratively using established pre-clinical assays. Results of the present study may also
highlight permeable metabolites of interest not currently under investigation for bioactivity. In the long term, this
project will establish a robust analytical strategy that can be used broadly to assess oral bioavailability of other
botanical supplements in an in vitro setting, prior to time, labor, and resource intensive in vivo studies."

 In hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), the epigenome confers self-renewal and differentiation functions
wherein inheritance of HSC chromatin states is persistent across cell cycles. My postdoctoral studies focused
on a fundamental epigenetic feature involving the local recycling of pre-existing, parental nucleosomes, which
showed that repressed, but not active, chromatin domains are inherited across DNA replication. While
identifying the histone chaperone(s) that facilitate the inheritance of repressed chromatin domains in mouse
embryonic stem cells, I discovered that nucleophosmin, NPM1, plays an essential role in this process. NPM1 is
a histone chaperone whose genetic mutation and rearrangement are found in ~30% of all adult AML, however
its function in normal hematopoiesis remains unknown. Furthermore, key questions persist on the inheritance
of H3K27me chromatin domains, such as what brings NPM1 and the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)
to the DNA replication fork during S-phase, how are polycomb chromatin domains inherited in the developing
immune system, and whether parental nucleosome segregation has a role in the precise balancing between
self-renewal and differentiation capacities that shape a hematopoietic cascade. In this proposal, my group will
identify the molecular basis for constructing the heritable human epigenome of HSCs and discover the
chromatin dynamics that provide HSCs the ability to both self-renew and differentiate. We will use in vitro
human induced pluripotent stem cells and differentiate them to derive a hematopoietic progenitor cell fate.
Using this system, we will conduct cutting age genome engineering, proteomics, and imaging technologies to
discover the function of histone chaperones and polycomb in constructing the heritable epigenome of HSCs."
10877809,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Rationale: Gene networks underpin all aspects of bacterial physiology. These networks mitigate antibiotic
induced stress in the context of antibiotic resistance, and drive microbe-microbe and microbe-host interactions
in the context of the human microbiome. Despite the central role of gene networks in maintaining viability and
organizing stress responses, there have been few studies that systematically compare gene networks across
bacterial species. Patterns in chemical-gene, gene-gene, and gene-promoter interactions will provide clues to
gene functions, pathways, and regulons, broadening our understanding of how the genetic backgrounds of
strains alter network connectivity.
Objective: Here we propose a cross-species comparison of genetic and regulatory networks in three enteric
species relevant to human health: Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
Comparisons to the well-studied model, E. coli K-12, will drive gene function discovery in E. cloacae and K.
pneumoniae, as well as provide a test bed for future cross species comparisons. To facilitate these analyses,
we have developed CRISPR-based tools that are easily portable across species and can be used to
investigate gene function and regulation at the genome scale. We seek to uncover fundamental mechanisms
of homeostasis and stress responses by identifying conserved pathways. Our basic research approach could
inform strategies that target weak points in gene networks of bacterial pathogens or could be applied to
examine host-modified networks in the context of the human microbiome."
10886771,"Project Summary:
Psychedelics have shown extraordinary promise as fast-acting and long-lasting anti-depressants, but few
selective agonists exist for the 5-HT2A receptor, which is the principal target for induction of psychedelic effects
in humans. Many lingering questions remain as to the receptor profile needed to produce anti-depressant
effects versus psychedelic effects, and whether these effects can be dissociated to yield effective non-
psychedelic anti-depressants with 5-HT2A agonism. Our preliminary data reveals that many of the prototypical
psychedelics are not selective for the 5-HT2A receptor. Therefore, the study of psychedelics alone is insufficient
to answer these long-standing questions and instead deserve a probe-based approach. This project seeks to
develop novel chemical probes to address the problems of i) 5-HT receptor selectivity and ii) pathway-selective
or biased agonism at the 5-HT2A receptor. Our preliminary data suggests that superior 5-HT2A-selective
agonists, and 5-HT2A/5-HT1B/1D mixed agonists can be designed using a structure-based approach. In Aim 1,
we will explore conformationally-restricted N-benzyl analogs to achieve optimal 5-HT2A selectivity and engineer
in substitutions to drive biased agonism. Aim 2, we will utilize a rationally-designed privileged scaffold that
shows promise as a 5-HT2A/5-HT1B/1D selective agonist, and engineer in substitutions designed to drive ligand
bias. Finally, in Aim 3, we will use the 5-HT1B/1D/1F-selective triptan scaffold to engineer in substitutions to cause
shifts in biased agonism at these receptor subtypes. Overall, this project aims to generate selective 5-HT
receptor biased and balanced agonist probe pairs, which will available to the research community for the
interrogation of psychedelic versus anti-depressant potential. Ultimately, this project will initiate novel treatment
strategies for mental health issues and usher in a new era of serotonin drug discovery.

10871846,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Loss of teeth due to oral disease, trauma, aging or congenital defects is one of the
most common organ failures. The first morphological sign of tooth development is the formation of the dental
lamina (DL). How the DL—the critical structure for initiation of a tooth development program—is specified from
naïve maxillary and mandibular ectoderm, remains poorly understood. We applied Laser Microdissection
coupled spatiotemporal RNA-seq and single cell Multiome-seq to profile mouse mandibular ectoderm during
DL specification and tooth initiation (E9.5-E12.5). In comparison to the non-DL epithelium (i.e., future skin), we
identified a set of potential driver transcription factors (TFs) for DL specification including Pitx1, Pitx2, Sox2,
and Foxe1. In contrast, another set of TFs was notably reduced in the DL, although enriched in aboral/ventral
ectoderm, including Tfap2a, Tfap2b, Irx3, and Irx4. While single ectodermal knock-out (KO) of Tfap2a or
Tfap2b resulted in normal DL and non-DL epithelial development we found that ectodermal double KO of both
resulted in severe non-DL epithelial defects, a spatial expansion of DL specification, and an ectopic tooth.
Similarly, we and other groups have found that the single KO of Pitx1, Pitx2 or Sox2 does not affect DL
specification, despite expression of these genes prior to DL specification and tooth defects at later stages.
Here, we propose that like the non-DL epithelium a redundant network exists to specify the DL epithelium. The
long-term goal of this study is development of stem cell-based approaches for tooth repair and regeneration.
The overall objective of the proposed research is to dissect the molecular and cellular mechanisms of tooth
initiation, particularly the core transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) that drive specification of the DL
within maxillary and mandibular ectoderm and initiation of a tooth development program. Our central
hypothesis is that a few key TFs—including PITX1, PITX2, SOX2, FOXE1, etc.—redundantly drive the core
TRNs that regulate DL formation and a tooth initiation program. Further, ectopic expression of a combination of
these TFs could convert non-DL epithelium (e.g., skin) to DL epithelium and induce ectopic tooth development.
In Aim 1, we will determine genetic redundancy and specificity of Pitx1, Pitx2 and Sox2 through double KO
models and CUT&RUN-based TF target identification. In Aim 2, we will define the PITX1/PITX2-driven
communication between DL epithelium and mesenchyme during tooth initiation using a Pitx1/Pitx2 KO mouse
model. Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine the core set of TFs sufficient to drive DL lineage specification and
non-DL epithelial reprogramming. Collectively, using a strong set of in vivo animal models, ex vivo explants,
and genome-wide assays, these studies will fill a critical knowledge-gap in our current understanding of DL
specification and its application to tooth regeneration. This experimental design and approach, along with
PI’s/CoI’s with complementary expertise, and the strong environment outlined in this proposal provide the
catalyst to improve oral and craniofacial health."
10907660,"Androgen receptor (AR) plays a critical role in prostate cancer (PCa) in all stages. While a majority of patients
with PCa initially respond to androgen deprivation and/or anti-androgen therapies, a significant portion of
patients develop castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Clinical studies showed that CRPC is often
enriched with AR splice variants lacking the ligand binding domain (LBD), thereby being constitutively active in
an androgen-independent manner and escaping from the antiandrogen enzalutamide-mediated AR inhibition.
The goal of this RO1 application is to develop and characterize novel therapeutics that effectively degrade
(remove) AR proteins in PCa. Technical innovations include the development of a novel therapeutic platform
for AR protein degradation using autophagy-targeting chimera (AUTOTAC). We successfully generated AR-
targeted AUTOTACs, which are bifunctional molecules, composed of enzalutamide (an AR ligand binding
domain inhibitor) or VPC-14449 (an AR DNA binding domain inhibitor) as a target binding ligand, linked to
YTK-6-2 as a ligand of the autophagic cargo receptor p62/Sequestosome-1/SQSTM1. AR-targeted AUTOTAC
brings the target protein AR to p62, forming a ternary complex. YTK-6-2 induces p62 self-oligomerization,
resulting in AR-p62 oligomeric complexes. YTK-6-2-activated p62 facilitates AR-p62-LC3 interaction on
autophagic membranes and promotes autophagosome biogenesis and degradation of AR proteins. Using
clinically relevant animal models that reflect the relevant tumor microenvironment and tumor heterogeneity, we
will test our novel hypothesis that AUTOTAC-mediated degradation (removal) of AR and its variants is a more
effective approach than the currently available therapeutics including anti-androgen therapy. We also
hypothesize that unlike anti-androgens which result in therapy-resistant PCa cells involving activation of
noncanonical AR signaling programs, the AR-targeted AUTOTAC platform is unlikely to result in noncanonical
AR signaling-associated malignant phenotypes. Aim 1 will characterize the molecular actions of AR LBD-
targeted AUTOTAC (Enz-AUTOTAC) and AR DBD-targeted AUTOTAC (VPC-AUTOTAC), and evaluate their
therapeutic efficacies in prostate cancer cell models. Aim 2 will evaluate the therapeutic efficacies of Enz-
AUTOTAC and VPC-AUTOTAC in vivo using PTEN knockout and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse
models of prostate cancer. Activation of potential oncogenic pathways in therapy-resistant tumors will be
examined in relation to the expression levels of AR and the status of AR variants. In addition to the
transcriptome analysis of tumor cells, tumor heterogeneity, cancer cell plasticity and tumor microenvironments
will also be assessed by single cell RNA-seq analysis before and after drug treatments. These data may lead
to the identification of additional therapeutic target(s) in castrate-resistant PCa.
Successful completion of the proposed study will develop a revolutionary drug platform of AR
degraders for patients with CRPC."

My research program aims to understand cellular mechanisms underlying robust embryonic tissue
patterning. Despite environmental fluctuations, tissues develop nearly identical patterns, shapes, and
sizes among different stage-matched individuals. In contrast, artificial tissues grown in vitro are highly
variable, limiting their value for disease modeling. How single cells can reliably sense and control
tissue parameters remains an important open question in both developmental biology and tissue
engineering.
Departing from the traditional focus of patterning control by biochemical signaling, my research aims
to understand how cells integrate biochemical and mechanical signals to detect and respond to
changes in tissue pattern and shape. We are empowered by our expertise in in vivo live imaging,
zebrafish genetics, computational modeling, and innovative approaches to manipulating tissues’
biochemical and mechanical environments. Using these multidisciplinary tools, we will test how cells
incorporate mechanical information to detect tissue-scale changes that are challenging to detect by
morphogen signaling alone. First, we will determine whether cells can sense the cell type identity of
their neighbors through cadherin-based adhesion, and use this information to modify cell fate
decisions and correct errors in tissue patterning. Second, we will identify mechano-responsive
morphogen signaling pathways and investigate whether mechanochemical crosstalk allows the cells
to infer their relative positions more accurately in tissues undergoing morphogenesis.
By revealing how tissue parameters are encoded by biochemical and mechanical signals, and how
cells decode mechanochemical signals to sense and control changes in tissue parameters, our
research will elucidate the information flow from tissue-scale changes to cellular responses. Our work
will establish cell adhesion and mechanical force as key channels of tissue information directing
accurate cellular decisions in early tissue patterning events, a novel paradigm that will impact our
understanding of development, mechanical consequences in diseases, and engineering strategies for
artificial tissues."

Weight gain patterns during the first year of life are a critical risk factor for long-term cardiometabolic health
from infancy through adulthood. Infant obesity risk is influenced by appetitive traits in the first 3 months. These
appetitive traits, food responsiveness (FR) and satiety responsiveness (SR), reflect food approach and
avoidance behaviors, respectively. However, little is known about factors that affect FR and SR development
during infancy, which may inform novel, effective behavioral interventions for obesity risk. Emerging data
indicate that sleep and circadian rhythms are related to appetite in children and adults, although little is known
about how sleep and circadian rhythms are associated with appetite development in infants. We posit the novel
hypothesis that infant sleep/circadian rhythm patterns affect infants’ appetite, and together, they impact infants’
obesity risk. We also posit that the degree of synchronization between maternal and infant circadian rhythms
further affects infant appetite development and obesity risk. In the proposed study, pregnant individuals
(N=230, body mass index ≥18.5 kg/m2) will be recruited in their third trimester. We acknowledge that not all
who give birth identify as women or females. We use the terms ""pregnant women,"" ""postpartum women,""
“maternal,” and ""mothers"" to refer to all birthing people throughout this application. Maternal-infant sleep and
circadian rhythms (focused on rest-activity rhythms and nighttime feeding), along with infant appetite and
weight, will be assessed via objective and subjective methods at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-months after birth. Thus, to
identify potentially modifiable influences on infant weight trajectory, the specific aims are to: (1) determine the
concurrent and predictive effects of infant sleep/circadian rhythms on infant appetite development in the first 6
months of life; (2) identify the combined effects of early infant appetite and disrupted sleep/circadian rhythms
on rapid infant weight gain in the first 6 months and infant weight outcomes at 12-months; and (3) explore the
role of maternal-infant synchronization of rest-activity rhythms in the models of infant sleep/circadian rhythms
and appetite predicting infant weight. This proposal addresses compelling questions about sleep, circadian
rhythms, and obesity identified in the NHLBI Strategic Vision and NIH Strategic Plan. Notably, in alignment with
the Katz Early Stage Investigator Research Grant Program, this proposal involves innovative changes in the
PI’s research direction: (1) new population (moving from mothers to infants); (2) new methods (moving from
self-report to objective assessment and dyadic metrics); and (3) new potential therapeutic targets (moving from
eating-related targets to sleep/circadian rhythms & maternal-infant synchronization). The PI and investigative
team have the content and methodological expertise that will ensure successful conduct of the proposed
research. In line with the NIH Science of Behavior Change intervention development pipeline, data from this
study will inform the targets and timing of maternal-infant behavioral interventions guided by circadian rhythms
and infant appetite development to reduce obesity risk and promote intergenerational cardiometabolic health."

Metabolomics offers a comprehensive analysis of thousands of small molecules in biological samples. It can
play an indispensable role in the growing systems biology approaches to unravel the relationships between
metabolites and diseases. Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas
chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) have been used for high-throughput analysis of
thousands of metabolites. However, the potential values of many disease-associated metabolites discovered by
using these platforms have been inadequately explored in systems biology approaches for biomarker discovery
due to lack of computational tools and resources to: (1) accurately determine the identity of most of the
metabolites; (2) investigate the rewiring interactions among the metabolites due to diseases; and (3) integrate
metabolite profiles with those from other omics studies to evaluate the relationships between the metabolites
and the diseases at the systems level. Partly due to these limitations, poor generalizability of previously identified
metabolite biomarker candidates has been observed, especially when they are evaluated through independent
platforms and validation sets. Therefore, new methods are sought to find more generalizable metabolite
biomarker candidates. The goal of this research program is to fill the gaps in metabolite identification and multi-
omics integration by using systems metabolomics approaches that will enhance the role of metabolomics in
systems biology approaches for biomarker discovery. Specifically, the proposed research program will utilize
multiple resources (biological databases, spectral libraries, etc.) and innovative statistical, machine learning, and
network-based methods for: (1) developing a comprehensive workflow for ranking putative metabolite IDs; (2)
differential analysis of metabolite profiles based on changes in the levels of individual metabolites and pairwise
interactions in disease vs. control groups; and (3) integration of metabolomics data with genomics,
transcriptomics, proteomics, and glycoproteomics data to identify highly promising metabolite biomarker
candidates. Our recent progress has led to acquisition of multi-omics data and development of computational
tools for metabolite identification and integrative analysis. The performance of the proposed metabolite
identification workflow in ranking putative metabolite IDs will be evaluated through experimental methods using
reference compounds. The differential and integrative analysis methods will be used for selection of candidate
biomarkers via multi-omics data acquired in biomarker discovery studies. The selected candidates will be
evaluated by targeted quantitation using independent samples and platforms compared to those used for
discovery. The outcomes of these experimental evaluations will be used not only to help refine the computational
methods but also to identify promising biomarker candidates. In summary, the proposed research program seeks
to capitalize on the power of network modeling, machine learning, and multi-omics data integration to improve
the ability to find disease biomarkers that are likely to succeed in future large-scale biomarker validation studies."

While research on substance using youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) is increasing, there is a dearth of
information regarding effective prevention interventions for these youth. This is of significant concern because
studies indicate that 66% to 89% of YEH have a mental health disorder (Cauce et al., 2004) and 68% report at
least one suicide attempt (Gewitz et al., 2020). In fact, suicide is the leading cause of death among YEH
(Rotheram-Borus & Milburn, 2004; Yoder et al., 2010). Among those who have attempted suicide, an average
of 6.2 attempts is reported, and lifetime suicidal ideation rates range from 14% to 66.5% (Yoder et al., 2010)
with no clear evidence of effective interventions for YEH. This study uses general cognitive theory (Beck,
1967), complemented with concepts from two suicide specific theoretical models, to guide our intervention and
conceptual change model. Our goal is to test strategies to extend delivery and uptake of a cognitive therapy
intervention for YEH. Prior studies focus on service-connected youth, but research suggests that most street
living YEH do not access services meant to assist them (Kelly & Caputo, 2007). We overcome prior sampling
limitations through engaging service-disconnected youth in addition to service-connected youth through a local
drop-in center. As such, three hundred substance using YEH with recent suicidal ideation or a recent
suicide attempt will be randomly assigned to Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention (CTSP) + Services
as Usual (SAU) (N=150) or to SAU alone (N=150). CTSP has previously shown efficacy for YEH through a
RCT pilot feasibility study (Slesnick et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020). SAU includes outreach, advocacy and
service linkage which are typical services offered by agencies serving those experiencing homelessness (Ober
et al., 2012). Follow-up assessments will be conducted at 3, 6, 9 and 12-months post-baseline. It is
hypothesized that youth receiving CTSP+SAU will show greater reductions in suicidal ideation (primary
outcome), substance use and depressive symptoms (secondary outcomes) over time compared to SAU alone,
as well as improved risk and protective factors. Theoretically-derived mediators will be tested to shed light on
mechanisms associated with change, and the moderating effects of sex, race, sexual orientation and baseline
service connection will be examined. In order to ease future dissemination of the intervention to agencies
serving YEH, we will rigorously assess acceptability, feasibility, fidelity and cost associated with the delivery of
our intervention approach using a mixed-methods approach. Ultimately, the goal of this research is to provide
support for the use of a suicide prevention intervention for substance using YEH that reduces premature
mortality, hospitalization, and loss of human capital and which can be easily adopted by agencies serving YEH."

training in dental and craniofacial research at the University of Iowa (UI) to a cohort of basic, clinical, and
translational researchers and dental scholars. It will provide dentists and non-dentists with a
comprehensive skillset to meet the challenges of oral health research in academia for the 21st century.
Outstanding interdisciplinary didactic training and rigorous research mentoring will emphasize ongoing review
and critique. The proposed program builds on 37 years of research training success, with several major
enhancements listed briefly below. The program addresses 7 major research training areas: 1) Craniofacial,
Oral Biology, Genetics, and Dental Development; 2) Bioengineering, Tissue Engineering, Stem Cells,
Biomaterials, and Materials; 3) Immunology, Inflammation, Microbiology, Caries, and Microbiome; 4) Oral
Cancer; 5) Public Health, Epidemiology, and Behavioral Sciences; 6) Oral Health Policy; and 7) Clinical,
Translational, and Big Data Research, reflecting the strengths of the College of Dentistry, UI health science
colleges, and collaborative institutes and centers. Trainees in the proposed program will pursue a PhD in Oral
Science (or in one of the 13 other affiliated PhD programs) or a post-doctoral fellowship. In addition, trainees
now will be able to obtain a Graduate Certificate in College Teaching, Biostatistics, or Translational and Clinical
Investigation or an MS in Dental Public Health. The T90 will support 4 non-dentist predocs and 2 dentists for
the PhD (3 years each) and 1 non-dentist postdoc (2 years). The R90 component reflects the importance
international dentists have in U.S. oral health research programs and will support 2 dentists for the PhD (3
years each). A group of 28 experienced program faculty from a variety of disciplines is available to mentor
trainees. The success of our program over the past 4+ years is seen in 5 trainees receiving F- or K-awards
since 2019 and trainees’ successful career placement. To build on this success, we propose several
improvements/new major components of this Oral Health Research Institutional Training Program. The
successful Grant-Writing Workshop Series has been updated and enhanced. Additionally, we propose several
new programs, including ones in Research Rigor, Research Leadership Development, and Interdisciplinary
Faculty Mentoring. Training will be supervised by the experienced Director and Associate Director and
implemented in concert with a Faculty Leadership Team. Several committees will support the program:
internal and external advisory committees, importantly a Committee on Recruitment and Diversity, and other
component-specific committees. In summary, the program brings together productive, well-funded mentors
with pre- and post-doctoral trainees in an environment with a strong institutional commitment, outstanding
interdisciplinary research training in relevant disciplines, and excellent educational and research facilities. The
outcome will be a cadre of oral health researchers ready to function at the cutting edge of their disciplines."

 Survival and proliferation are fundamental cell activities that are exploited during oncogenesis. A key cellular
pathway that supports survival and proliferation is the nuclear factor-Kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway, which
is also hyperactive in cancer cells and is a noted element that contributes to therapeutic resistance, a
phenomenon observed in various cancers, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). With an incidence of
about 30 cases per million, ALL is the most common cancer among children and the most frequent cause of
death from cancer before 20 years of age. In a recent study, it was shown that the elevated expression of coilin,
the Cajal body (CB) marker protein, is a negative prognostic factor in ALL patients. Recent work by our lab has
discovered that coilin is a positive regulator in the biogenesis of microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of noncoding
RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression. However, the mechanism for this function is unclear. Another
positive regulator of miRNA biogenesis is N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methylation, a reversible modification
that is installed by writers, removed by erasers, and acted on by readers. Our lab hypothesized that coilin was
influencing miRNA biogenesis through the regulation of m6A RNA methylation and we have generated exciting
preliminary data showing that coilin suppression results in a decrease in the expression of m6A writer METTL3,
reader hnRNPA2B1, and eraser ALKBH5 proteins, as well as a their mislocalization within the cell and a
reduction in global m6A RNA levels. Additionally, work published by our lab found that coilin positively regulates
the expression of miR-517, a NF-κB activator. Since the NF-κB pathway is both regulated by and a regulator of
the biogenesis of several miRNAs, and in consideration of previously published work on coilin, we have
generated the central hypothesis that coilin supports m6A RNA methylation through which it regulates miRNA
biogenesis and facilitates the survival and proliferation of the cell. This hypothesis will be tested with the use of
various primary and transformed cell lines, and our newly generated, CRISPR/Cas9-engineered coilin zebrafish
models. To test our central hypothesis, two specific aims have been generated for which we will test the
hypotheses that: 1) Coilin directs the optimal synthesis, posttranslational modification, and localization of m6A
RNA Writers, Readers, and Erasers; and 2) Coilin mediates m6A RNA methylation by which miRNA biogenesis
and survival & proliferative pathways are regulated. This work will characterize three novel CRISPR-engineered
zebrafish coilin lines while also investigating a novel pathway by which coilin mediates m6A RNA methylation
and regulates miRNA biogenesis. Findings in this proposal will highlight a novel role for coilin in facilitating
survival and proliferation, as well as a potential prognostic or therapeutic role for coilin in cancers, such as ALL."
10930694,"Project Summary/ Abstract:
The E1-E2-E3 ligase cascade is responsible for tagging substrate proteins with ubiquitin. Addition of ubiquitin
then directs the tagged protein along one of several paths, including marking it for proteasome-mediated
degradation. The E3 ligase is responsible for recognition of substrate proteins, and thus encodes the specificity
of ubiquitin transfer. The human proteome comprises about 600 known E3 ligases, each with a distinct
substrate specificity that allows it to engage a prescribed subset of the proteome. Given that one of the
prototypical consequences of ubiquitination is to mark a protein for destruction, it is unsurprising that
dysregulation or mutation of E3 ligases can lead to a disruption of cellular homeostatic balance: accordingly,
E3 ligases have been implicated in a wide variety of diseases including autoimmune disease and cancer.
Intriguingly, certain disease-associated mutations have been found to alter the substrate specificity of an E3
ligase – these mutations not only impact the cellular levels of proteins within the E3’s normal interactome, but
rather they change the E3 ligase’s interactome. Similar effects have also been observed from certain small
molecules, termed molecular glues, that also modify the substrate specificity of an E3 ligase: these compounds
typically redirect an E3 ligase to ubiquitinate some “neo-substrate”, ultimately leading to degradation of this
protein. Thus, molecular glues afford the possibility of targeting disease-causing proteins that were previously
thought to be undruggable. To date, however, the transient nature of E3 ligase’s interactions with their
substrates (and neo-substrates) has served as a bottleneck for identifying both endogenous and “glue-able”
substrates of E3 ligases. To address this, here I propose to develop cutting-edge structure-based machine
learning methods to (1) computationally identify endogenous substrates of E3 ligases, and (2) rationally design
molecular glues that degrade a traditionally undruggable target protein. After carefully benchmarking the
underlying methods for each task, I will apply the former to comprehensively catalog substrates of three
specific disease-relevant E3 ligases. In parallel, I will apply my approach for the latter to design molecular
glues intended to degrade ADAR1, a key protein that promotes resistance to immune checkpoint blockade
therapy and is thus a potential target for intervention in many different cancers. Beyond the immediate scope of
this proposal, I anticipate that the methods developed through these studies will help illuminate the underlying
biology of many other E3 ligases, and will facilitate development of molecular glue degraders targeting key
drivers in many other diseases."

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) of HIV infection has been one of the most successful public health interventions in
history, but the emergence of HIV drug resistance is a threat to ending the HIV epidemic. The next phase of the
global HIV response will rely on integrase strand transfer inhibitors (InSTIs), particularly dolutegravir (DTG), a
potent antiretroviral with a high genetic barrier to resistance. DTG is recommended for all lines of treatment (1st,
2nd- and 3rd-line) by the World Health Organization, and drugs from the same class are developed for pre-
exposure prophylaxis. There is limited understanding of the spectrum of DTG-selected mutations and their
effects on phenotypic susceptibility, particularly in non-B subtype viruses, and of the importance of mutations
outside of the integrase gene. It is critical to establish robust systems for early detection of InSTI resistance in
HIV treatment programs, and develop an understanding of where and how resistance to DTG occurs in real
world cohorts. We propose to do this in the NIH-funded International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS
(IeDEA) and the Antiretroviral Therapy Cohort Collaboration (ART-CC). Specifically, we aim i) to determine the
patterns and spectrum of InSTI drug resistance mutations in adults and adolescents with virologic failure on
DTG-based ART by regimen and HIV-1 subtype; ii) to identify risk factors for virologic failure and resistance in
adolescents and adults on DTG-based ART; and iii) to investigate correlations between novel resistance
genotypes and phenotypic InSTI resistance across HIV-1 subtypes. In total, 46 IeDEA sites and 7 ART-CC
cohorts from 32 countries will participate in this study. Ten sites and cohorts will contribute existing data (Sanger
sequences and clinical data), rather than prospectively recruiting patients; 19 sites and cohorts will contribute
pairs of samples or sequences at switch and failure, and 32 will contribute data on adolescents. We will include
adults (≥18 years) and adolescents (10-17 years) with virologic failure (viral load ≥1000 copies/mL) on any DTG-
based ART. Analyses will be based on about 4600 patients failing DTG-based ART and about 490 patients with
DTG drug resistance mutations. We will perform whole genome sequencing using the Illumina MiSeq next-
generation sequencing platform to detect integrase mutations and mutations outside integrase (e.g. in the 3'
polypurine tract region of the nef gene). We will combine the data with existing sequence data from North
American and European cohorts. We will compare the prevalence of InSTI DRMs at different frequency
thresholds (20%, 5%, and 2%) by ART regimen and HIV-1 subtype. We will identify predictors of virologic failure
and drug resistance, and characterize the phenotypic effect of novel resistance genotypes by performing
phenotypic testing on selected specimens across the range of HIV-1 subtypes. Our proposal has three key
strengths: i) the pooling of clinical and sequence data across a vast global network to explore the determinants
of DTG resistance in people on 1st, 2nd-, and 3rd-line ART; ii) inclusion of multiple HIV-1 subtypes across
geographic areas and iii) combining expertise from clinical, epidemiological, biological, and computational fields."
10908566,"ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY
Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophinopathies (DMD/BMD) have a mutation in the dystrophin gene that,
together, represent over 80% of all cases of muscular dystrophy. Historically, respiratory failure was the major
cause of morbidity and mortality but recent treatment advances have changed the prognosis, with dilated
cardiomyopathy and the resulting heart failure now being the leading cause of death. Currently, there is no
consensus on predictors of cardiac disease trajectory, when to start treatment with cardiac medications, or the
most appropriate outcome measures to evaluate the impact of therapies on the heart in patients with DMD and
BMD. The long-term goal is to reduce the incidence and delay the progression of dilated cardiomyopathy/heart
failure in children with DMD and BMD. The objective of this study is to determine the effects of DMD and BMD
on peripheral vascular function and pulsatile load on the left ventricle (LV), and to determine if these variables
can predict cardiac function. The central hypothesis is that both DMD and BMD patients will exhibit detrimental
changes in their peripheral vascular health and pulsatile load on the LV which will relate to their cardiac function.
This hypothesis is based on novel preliminary data showing an attenuation in peripheral vascular function and
augmented central pressures and wave reflections, suggestive of increased pulsatile load, in both DMD and
BMD patients. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine the effects of
DMD and BMD on peripheral vascular function; 2) Determine the effects of DMD and BMD on pulsatile load on
the LV; and 3) Determine if peripheral vascular function and pulsatile load on the LV can help predict cardiac
function in patients with DMD and BMD. Under the first aim peripheral vascular function will be assessed using
both a cross-sectional (baseline) and longitudinal design (12 & 24 months) in cohorts of DMD and BMD patients
and typically-developing children. For the second aim, pulsatile load on the LV will be evaluated by assessing
reflection magnitude, forward wave amplitude, aortic characteristic impedance, and arterial stiffness in the same
design and participants as study aim 1. Finally, the third aim will use measures of peripheral vascular function
and pulsatile load to evaluate predictors of cardiac function measured by echocardiography. The research
proposed in this application is innovative because it represents the initial attempts at determining peripheral
vascular function and pulsatile load on the LV in DMD and BMD patients which is the logical next step to previous
animal studies. Additionally, the study uses novel, state-of-the-art non-invasive methodology that has the
potential to be integrated into regular clinical practice to better diagnose and possibly predict cardiomyopathy
development throughout DMD and BMD disease progression. The proposed research is significant because it
will inform future interventional studies, including clinical trials that will ultimately alter the trajectory of care for
the young patients struggling with DMD and BMD-related cardiomyopathy."

The long term goal of the COBRE for Computational Biology of Human Disease (CBHD) is to enhance the
integration of basic biological and computational approaches to the study of human disease at Brown, its affiliated
hospitals and across Rhode Island. Realizing this goal requires expertise that can support researchers across
the spectrum from molecular biologists and clinical researchers using high throughput sequencing, to data
scientists mining large publicly available human genomic datasets. In the initial Phase 1 support for this COBRE,
we established the CBHD community and built the Computational Biology Core (CBC) facility to support junior
faculty Project Leaders (PLs) that spanned this range of research. This support has led to seven NIH R01/R35
awards plus additional grants for our Project Leaders and Pilot awardees totaling more than $17.9M. In this
Phase 2 renewal proposal we will strengthen and broaden the support for the CBC to enable a new cohort of
CBHD COBRE PLs, plus other researchers in the Brown biomedical community, to advance their research into
the computational biology of human disease. Computational and bioinformatic analyses have become a common
language in contemporary biomedical research and are central tools required for researchers to realize the
advances in genome enabled science. Our CBHD COBRE seeks to translate these tools into shared, accessible
resources that will strengthen the competitiveness, and sense of community for all biomedical researchers in
Rhode Island. The proximate goal of this COBRE in Phase 2 will be providing support for junior faculty PLs and
Pilot awardees in the analysis and interpretation of massive sequencing datasets generated in their own labs or
obtained from publicly available datbases. This will provide support for investigators who lack resources to build
the necessary skill sets within their research groups, and accelerate their progress towards research funding
independence. The central approach of the CBC will be to serve as a hub of collaborative service through the
development of reproducible software pipelines and providing workshops for training of researchers to acquire
bioinformatics fluency. This will enhance scientific interactions between diverse projects and broaden the sense
of the community across the CBHD COBRE. The long-term goal of the CBC is to provide a sustainable resource
to support the analytical challenges in ‘omics-scale human disease research across Brown University, our
affiliated hospitals, and other researchers in Rhode Island. This will be achieved through three Specific Aims: 1.
Strengthen computational and bioinformatics support for biomedical researchers; 2. Develop reproducible
pipelines and interfaces to global data analysis and data sharing platforms; 3. Extend training and workshops to
enhance computational skills of the broader community. This will bring the language of computational biology to
a broader audience and increase the skill levels across the community, enhancing research capacity for all."

Primary tumors shed circulating tumor cells (CTCs) into the bloodstream that metastasize
preferentially to distant organs, resulting in 90% of cancer related fatalities. For example, estrogen
receptor positive (ER+) breast cancers exhibit high rates of metastasis to bone, with decreased rates to liver
and lung. CTCs exhibit heterogeneous gene expression programs and functional phenotypes, which are
selected by soluble and mechanical interactions within each metastatic “niche.” A critical challenge is to
predict how patient-specific CTCs disseminate throughout the body and respond to therapeutic treatments. An
exciting strategy is to culture CTCs ex vivo for drug screening informed by genomic and transcriptional profiling.
We seek to elucidate how CTCs respond to different features of the metastatic niche by engineering controlled
interactions with tissue-specific extracellular matrix (ECM) and with human primary stromal cells, which may
recapitulate disease progression and therapeutic resistance in these microenvironmental contexts.
Our long-term goal is to establish preclinical assays for patient CTCs to predict metastatic disease
progression and screen targeted inhibitors. Realization of this goal involves several technical challenges,
including: 1) Tissue-mimetic matrix with tunable biochemistry and mechanics, 2) Multicellular tissue constructs
with controlled size and cellular composition, 3) Gene expression profiling of CTCs in response to soluble and
mechanical stimuli, 4) Spatiotemporal analysis of phenotypic heterogeneity, including the epithelial-
mesenchymal transition (EMT), and 5) Validation with human patient samples. Thus, our overall objective is
to understand how CTC gene expression and mechanophenotype is regulated by matrix or stromal interactions
in tissue-mimetic microenvironments. This discovery-based approach can deconstruct patterns of gene
expression driven by decellularized extracellular matrix or the secretome of human stromal cells. Such
bioinformatics analyses can identify possible therapeutic strategies based on existing patient, xenograft, and
high-throughput screens.
PI: Wong is a New Investigator with expertise in cancer cell migration, biomaterials, and microfluidics. Mentor:
Reichner is an expert on directed cell migration and mechanobiology and Mentor: Bertone is an expert on
single cell analyses in cancer. We investigate the relative contributions of microenvironmental stimuli using
three aims: AIM 1 will elucidate how individual breast cancer cells interact with tissue-mimetic matrix and AIM 2
will engineer co-cultured multicellular spheroids with stromal cells."

The central theme of the Indiana University (IU) Cooperative Center of Excellence in Hematology (CCEH) is
the regulation of nonmalignant human and murine hematopoiesis at the level of hematopoietic stem (HSC) and
progenitor (HPC) cells, cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and the microenvironment. This was the focus
of the IU-CCEH during the last funding period. We continue to pursue this hefty goal, as we realize that there is
still much more that needs to be rigorously defined in these areas. The goals of the investigations of members
of this center are to leverage different components of the hematopoietic system to improve and advance
clinical utility and efficacy of HSC/HPC-based therapies. Treatment of inherited disorders of bone marrow-
derived cells can be achieved by both cellular and genetic approaches that are applicable to many diseases
and disorders. However, successful application of these modalities requires a deeper understanding of the
cellular, molecular, biochemical HSC and HPC regulation and hematopoietic parameters impacting their
efficient use in transplantation such as homing, cell cycle regulation, self-renewal, epigenetics, and the status
of the hematopoietic niche. The proposed IU-CCEH brings together the active participation of 25 members who
are well funded by the NIH, DoD, or the VA. These investigators are highly interactive with diverse and
complementary expertise in hematopoiesis and HSC biology and other disciplines that impact directly or
indirectly on multiple components of the hematopoietic system. The IU-CCEH proposes the establishment of 3
biomedical research cores focused on bringing state-of-the-art technologies that advance the work of the
members of this center, other similar CCEH centers across the country, and qualified investigators nationwide
who do not belong to any NIDDK-funded CCEH. In addition, the IU-CCEH will have an Enrichment Program
Core tasked with establishing training programs for young and future scientists interested in nonmalignant
hematology research. The specific aims of the IU-CCEH are: 1) Establish, operate, and administer three vital
biomedical cores providing essential services to investigators at the IUSM and others outside the IUSM who
are involved in the highest quality nonmalignant basic and clinical research in HSC/HPC biology. 2) Establish,
operate and administer an Enrichment Program to support, promote and enhance the research of young
investigators in the area of nonmalignant HSC regulation and clinical utility of HSC. 3) Actively participate in
the implementation of a Partner Pilot and Feasibility funding mechanism organized by all NIDDK-sponsored
CCEH centers across the U.S.A. 4) Coordinate fiscal management of the cores of the proposed application. 5)
Work closely and cooperate with other CCEH centers nationwide to adopt and implement policies, funding
mechanisms, and opportunities via our proposed cores targeting young as well as established investigators to
promote and sponsor diverse areas of nonmalignant hematology research at the highest levels."
10899547,"The Cooperative Centers of Excellence in Hematology (CCEH) will be utilized by investigators for in vivo
studies focused on molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in steady state hematopoiesis, the bone
marrow niche, BM transplantation, and immune cell function. Centralization will prevent duplication of
resources, ensure consistent supply of acclimated mice, and maintain high quality research infrastructure
essential for conducting in vivo studies of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) function. The
Experimental Mouse Resources Core (EMRC) will provide CCEH investigators advanced resources for their
studies using mice for murine and human transplantation models. The specific aims of the EMRC are:
1. Maintain on-site breeding colonies of essential mice to study human and murine hematopoiesis in
 vivo. For investigations focused on human hematopoiesis, colonies of NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl/J (NSG)
 and NOD.Cg-Ragtm1MomIl2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ and (NRG) immunodeficient mice will be maintained. In anticipation of
 future needs, a starter colony of the triple transgenic NSG-SGM3 (NSGS) mice that express human IL3,
 GM-CSF and SCF has been established and can be expanded as needed. Breeding colonies of
 C57/BL/6J, B6.SJL-Ptprca Pepcb/BoyJ (Boy/J), and the BoyJ x C57BL/6J (F1 cross) mouse strains will be
 maintained. The F1 cross is a unique strain and is not commercially available. Congenic mouse strains
 allow for simultaneous tracking of donor, competitor, and recipient cells.
2. Provide specialized core services and consultation to CCEH investigators. EMRC personnel will
 conduct irradiations, transplantations, serial sampling of peripheral blood, and compound dosing. The Core
 will harvest and provide tissues from transplanted mice to investigators for detailed analysis by the CCEH
 Flow and Tissue Cytometry Core. The ERMC will work closely with the Hypoxia Core to coordinate
 transplant of mouse and human HSPC collected and processed under hypoxia versus ambient air (Mantel
 et al., Cell 2015). The EMRC Director will coordinate with Core personnel all procedures, experimental
 design, methodology, and data interpretation. Expertise and infrastructure is in place to facilitate all aspects
 of BMT studies seamlessly for on-site CCEH members as well as PIs on a national level.
3. Serve as an educational resource for CCEH laboratories. Exceptional connectivity between the EMRC
 and the other biomedical cores as well as the Enrichment core will augment the research and training
 activities of the CCEH membership and their trainees. Training in the execution of high-quality in vivo
 studies will be a critical and essential component in training our next generation of scientists to be
 successful in research careers dedicated to the study of nonmalignant hematology.
4. Work in concert with other CCEH centers and investigators Nationwide to provide EMRC services to
 the community of scientists involved in nonmalignant hematology research."

A quantitative Flow and Tissue Cytometry core (FTCC, core 3) is proposed for the Cooperative Center of
Excellence in Hematology (CCEH) to support the research efforts of members of the center. Flow cytometry is
an integral research tool for the vast majority of CCEH investigators. Of the 25 current CCEH members, 16
routinely utilize classical flow cytometric services in their research, and more than 65% of their publications
over the last 10 years utilized flow cytometric services. However, many need to interpret flow cytometry
information in the context of the spatial relationships in the hematopoietic niche; for example, to identify how
cells interact with one another and with cellular and physical components of the niche in normal and stressed
conditions. To address this need, the FTCC will complement flow cytometry with unique imaging services,
including 3D tissue cytometry and intravital microscopy. In this way, the core will offer CCEH members a
critical service along with the opportunity to extend their interrogation of hematopoietic cells to include
quantitative analyses of the spatial distribution of HSC with other cells during different conditions of
nonmalignant hematopoiesis. The FTCC capitalizes on existing shared facilities and expertise present within
the Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM) to provide CCEH members with the latest in technologies
and services expected form a sophisticated flow and tissue cytometry facility. The FTCC will provide a cost-
effective resource to CCEH investigators who can utilize this core to apply a powerful and integrated approach
to studies of non-malignant hematology that will be an invaluable asset to their research, as well as to
hematology investigators across the country. The specific aims of the FTCC are: 1- Provide outstanding,
consistent, timely, and economical multicolor analysis, cell sorting, image flow analysis, and single cell
proteomic analysis to all CCEH members to facilitate the conduct of their research in hematopoiesis and stem
cell biology that requires any of these services. 2- Enhance the productivity of CCEH members by providing
centralized and standardized flow cytometric and other related services that allow for the exchange of
protocols and results between investigators within and outside Indiana University and advance the distribution
of scientific knowledge. 3-Provide CCEH members with large-scale 3D and highly-multiplexed 2D tissue
cytometry services, extending from study design, fluorescence labeling, image collection, quantitative image
analysis and supervised and unsupervised data analysis. 4- Provide CCEH members with intravital microscopy
services, including preparation of institutional compliance documents, study design, animal surgery, image
collection and quantitative image analysis. This arrangement will give CCEH investigators and all investigators
Nationwide, powerful new tools for their nonmalignant hematology investigations."
10899554,"This revised shared Hypoxia core (HC) is proposed for the Indiana University (IU) Cooperative Center of
Excellence in Hematology (CCEH) to support and enhance research efforts of members of our center, other

hematology. Information generated is critical for better in vivo understanding of phenotypic and functional
cellular, molecular, and biochemical aspects of hematopoietic stem (HSC), progenitor (HPC), immune, and
stromal cells. This involves regulation of normal hematopoiesis and pre-leukemia in context of their lowered
oxygen (O2) environment in vivo. O2 tension within bone marrow (BM;1-5%) and cord blood (CB) or mobilized
peripheral blood (mPB; <10%), is lower than in the ambient air (~21% O2) in which they are routinely collected
for analysis. While it has been known for >40 years that HSC and HPC grow better ex-vivo in lowered (≤ 5%)
O2, our report (Mantel, et. al., Cell, 2015) and more recent work shown in this HC grant project, demonstrated
previously unknown information that collection/processing of BM, CB, and mPB in ambient air results in large
decreases in phenotypically defined and functional HSC and increased HPC numbers within minutes of cell
exposure to ambient air. We termed this process Extra Physiological Shock/Stress (EPHOSS).
Collection/processing of cells at 3% O2, such that they are never exposed to ambient air resulted in 2 to 5-fold
increases in phenotypically- and functionally-detectable HSC. As well, this manifested as different gene
expression patterns and responsiveness to stimuli associated with HSC. Similar changes were also noted with
murine pre-leukemic and immune cells. Re-evaluation of hematopoietic function associated with maintenance
of HSC and HPC at lowered O2 levels can now be elucidated through the expertise of our HC. New data
derived with our hypoxia chamber in the revised HC demonstrates the incredible power of the HC to help the
hematopoietic community. Specific Aims of the HC involving normal and non-malignant murine and human
hematology are: 1) Provide outstanding, consistent and timely analysis of mouse and human BM, mPB,
immune and stromal cells, and human CB, BM, and mPB collected/processed at 3%, as well as other, O2
tensions compared to that in ambient air; 2) Coordinate with the other IU CCEH cores for in-depth analysis of
cells collected in hypoxia vs. ambient air; 3) Enhance productivity of our CCEH and other CCEH members, and
outside investigators by providing a centralized set of services with reduced cost, and expert guidance not
currently available elsewhere; and 4) Provide advice regarding intricacies of such studies, analyses, and
overcoming potential problems. The HC provides an economic resource that will add new and significant
cutting-edge scientific analysis to greatly advance our current understanding of HSC/HPC and immune and
stromal cell biology in ways that will increase their translational use for clinical benefit."

and as a consequence breed success. Our goal will be accomplished by (1) enhancing interdisciplinary
interactions amongst CCEH faculty and trainees, both within and outside IU; (2) organizing educational venues
for students at different educational levels through a combination of internships, interactive discussions, and a
CCEH Core sponsored interactive workshop; (3) Establish a travel award program to facilitate customized,
multi-tiered education and training opportunities for trainees and early phase investigators locally and
nationwide to conduct non-malignant hematology research through the IU CCEH Cores; and, (4) serve as a
national resource in the training of non-malignant hematology research that can facilitate and assist in the use
of our cores by other CCEH members and by young investigators outside IU. The EP Program will help recruit
and retain productive and talented young investigators by providing innovative impactful opportunities to
enhance training and mentoring in the field of non-malignant hematology research. The long-term outcome of
training provided by the EP will foster ground-breaking discoveries that can ultimately be applied to
development of clinical trials targeting inherited and non-inherited disorders of the hematopoietic system."
10829208,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Depression is one of the major contributors to the global burden of disease, with the World Health Organization
(WHO) ranking it as the number one non-fatal contributor. Most cases of depression appear by an individual’s
third decade of life, which is classified as early onset depression. The long-term effects of early onset depression
extend well into adulthood, usually leading to a high rate of recurrence and significant health concerns. Research
has shown that early intervention prior to disease onset leads to the best outcomes. Therefore, detecting early
markers of depression risk would help mitigate the disease. Previous investigations have looked at the effect of
environmental exposures or genetic influences separately, with studies beginning to examine the interactive
effects of genes and the environment on risk for depression. Though, few studies have been done examining
how gene-by-environment interactions may map onto prodromal brain and behavioral biomarkers of risk for early
onset depression, which could greatly assist in early detection and treatment. Specifically, select brain structure
and functional networks as well as distinct emotional behaviors – such as, positive affect and withdrawal
symptoms – have been consistently associated with early onset depression. Ultimately, it suggests that these
may be important biomarkers in studying how gene-by-environment may contribute to risk for depression that
emerges prior to disease onset. Thus, this study will examine whether the well-known environmental predictor
of family income-to-needs may have independent and/or interactive effects along with an individual’s polygenic
risk score for depression on the development of emotional brain structure and function from pre- to early
adolescence. To accomplish this goal, the current study will leverage existing longitudinal data from
approximately 5,000 subjects 9-10 year-of-age at baseline to 11-12 year-of-age at the 2-year follow-up from
across the United States as part of the larger Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development? Study (ABCD Study®).
Using two time point data for the brain imaging and up to three time points for emotional behavior outcome data,
we will examine how gene-by-environment interactions effect changes in brain size and function. Aim 1 and Aim
2 will examine the independent and interactive effect of an individual’s income-to-needs and polygenic risk for
depression on functional brain connectivity and brain structure of key emotional regions previously associated
with depression, respectively. Aim 3 will further test whether the income-to-needs and polygenic risk score relate
to established prodromal emotional behaviors. Ultimately, the findings from this project hold the potential to
identify potential brain-behavior biomarkers that may be important to consider in establishing risk for early onset
depression, ultimately helping to improve early detection and treatment."
10919813,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
 Acute myocardial infarction (AMI), a major cause of cardiovascular disability and death in the US, can be
triggered by environmental exposures like heat, cold, and fine particulate air pollution (PM2.5). However, less is
known about whether temperature variability, elevated temperature-humidity metrics, or ground-level ozone
exposures could also trigger AMI, especially in young (aged 18-55 years) and older (aged ≥75 years) adults.
These exposures take on increasing importance in the context of climate change. Moreover, it remains unclear
whether women, persons of low socioeconomic status (SES), people with pre-existing chronic conditions, or
users of certain medications have elevated vulnerability to heat-related AMI risk. Furthermore, evidence
regarding whether co-exposures to extreme heat and air pollution interactively trigger AMI remains largely
lacking. The overall objectives in this application are to (i) evaluate the effects of extreme heat and air pollution
on AMI; and (ii) identify potential effect modification by sex, SES, medical history, and air pollution on the
association between exposure to extreme heat and AMI risk. To achieve these objectives, we will use two unique
US nationwide multicenter prospective observational cohort studies: VIRGO (Variation in Recovery: Role of
Gender on Outcomes of Young AMI Patients) and SILVER-AMI (Comprehensive Evaluation of Risk Factors in
Older Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction). We will link patient-level medical record and interview data with
highly spatiotemporally resolved estimates of ambient air temperature and air pollution predicted from satellite-
based ensemble models and apply time-stratified case-crossover designs coupled with state-of-the-art
distributed lag nonlinear models. Specifically, we aim to: (1) assess the association of AMI occurrence with short-
term exposure to extreme heat, heat waves, temperature variability (both within and between days), and
temperature-humidity metrics (i.e., heat index, humidex, and wet bulb temperature) and examine its sex and
socioeconomic disparities; (2) determine whether medical history (pre-existing chronic conditions and medication
use) modifies the association between extreme heat and risk of AMI occurrence; and (3) estimate the association
of short-term co-exposure to extreme heat and air pollution (PM2.5 or ozone) with risk of AMI occurrence. The
proposed research is significant because it is expected to provide strong and actionable scientific evidence on
the roles of exposure to extreme heat and air pollution in AMI risk and on the roles of sex, SES, pre-existing
conditions, medication intake, and air pollution in contributing to population vulnerability to heat-related AMI, thus
greatly aiding clinicians, policymakers, and stakeholders to more effectively prevent adverse impacts of extreme
heat and air pollution in relation to AMI risk, especially under a warming climate."
10836421,"Background: While the VA has provided life-saving organ transplantation to Veterans for decades, critics of the
VA Transplant Program claimed that its requirement for Veterans to travel to designated VA Transplant Centers
across the nation reduced access to care. The passage of the MISSION Act by Congress in 2018 markedly
expanded the number of Veterans eligible to pursue transplantation and post-transplant care in the community.
We recently investigated where Veterans dually enrolled in VA and Medicare underwent kidney transplantation
and received post-transplant care and the association of the site of transplant care with long-term mortality. The
findings of this work suggest that the MISSION Act could substantially transform patterns and processes of VA
transplant care and unintentionally lead to adverse health outcomes following transplantation.
Significance/Impact: Characterizing the effects of the MISSION Act on VA transplantation and the factors that
influence where Veterans receive transplant care is critical to refine policies governing the VA Transplant
Program and allocation of resources to support the delivery of transplant-related care to Veterans with end-stage
kidney and/or liver disease. Our study will provide novel insights into how the MISSION Act is affecting patterns
and processes of transplant care, as well as outcomes of kidney and liver transplantation among Veterans.
Findings from this study will enable Veterans and VA providers to make evidence-based decisions on the source
of transplant care that optimizes long-term allograft function and overall survival.
Innovation: Our study will be the first to assess the impact of the MISSION Act on processes and outcomes of
kidney and liver transplant care and the only study to combine data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant
Recipients (SRTR) and the VA Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) to characterize the effect of this legislation
on Veterans’ transplant care and outcomes.
Specific Aims. Our specific aims are to: (1) describe temporal patterns of VA and community transplant care (i.e.,
activation on the wait list, receipt of transplant, and post-transplant management) among Veterans approved for
kidney or liver transplantation before and after implementation of the MISSION Act; (2) identify patient and
system factors associated with the site Veterans are wait listed for and undergo kidney or liver transplantation
and receive post-transplant care (VA vs. community vs. dual); (3) examine the associations of site of: (a) wait
listing; (b) transplant surgery; and (c) post-transplant care with key outcomes (i.e., time on the wait list, death on
the wait list, receipt of transplant, allograft failure, and mortality) among Veterans approved for kidney or liver
transplantation; and (4) qualitatively examine key stakeholders’ (i.e., Veterans, VA providers, VA operations
leaders) perceptions of the facilitators of and barriers to Veterans’ use of VA for kidney and liver transplant care.
Methodology: We will link SRTR and CDW data to construct a cohort of Veterans enrolled in VA who were
activated on the UNOS wait list for kidney and/or liver transplantation between 7/1/2010 and 6/30/2022. Using
this cohort, we will characterize secular trends in VA and community transplant care, quantitatively assess patient
and system factors associated with the site that Veterans undergo transplant and receive post-transplant care,
and examine the associations of site of transplant care with key transplant-related outcomes. We will also
conduct semi-structured interviews with Veterans, VA providers, and VA operations leaders to qualitatively
assess their perceptions of facilitators and barriers to Veterans’ use of VA for transplant care.
Implementation/Next Steps: Our next steps will include: (1) continued partnership with operational leaders in
VA’s Office of Community Care and National Surgery Office to design, deploy, and evaluate interventions
informed by this research to improve the processes and outcomes of transplant care for Veterans; and (2) broad
dissemination of our findings to key stakeholders including Veterans, nephrologists, hepatologists, and transplant
surgeons to inform their decision-making regarding the optimal site of transplant and post-transplant care."
10923831,"Background: Surgery can precipitate the development of both chronic pain and long-term opioid use.
Preoperative psychological distress is a risk factor for poor post-surgical outcomes. Strategies are needed to
augment perioperative pharmacotherapeutic management of pain with non-pharmacologic strategies to
optimize post-operative outcomes. Psychological interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can
effectively reduce distress and improve functioning among patients with chronic pain. While CBT has been
used extensively in patients with established chronic pain, it has not been used as a preventive intervention
targeting the transition from acute to chronic postsurgical pain.
 Significance/Impact: This proposal addresses the priority areas of chronic pain and opioid use. This study
enhances biopsychosocial pain care during the perioperative period and offers a model to prevent the
development of chronic pain and prolonged opioid use following surgery.
 Innovation: The proposed innovative approach to preventing, rather than managing, chronic postsurgical
pain among Veterans could incite a clinical paradigm shift from pain treatment to prevention.
 Specific Aims: Aim 1: Use a Hybrid Type 1 Randomized Controlled Trial design to examine the efficacy of
the Perioperative Pain Self-management (PePS) program versus Standard Care (SC) for preventing chronic
postoperative pain and prolonged opioid use. Exploratory analyses will examine whether substance use
disorders moderate treatment effects and whether changes in pain catastrophizing and self-efficacy relate to
postoperative pain at 6-months post-surgery. Aim 2: Determine the impact of the PePS program on secondary
outcomes: mood, functioning, and non-opioid analgesic prescriptions. Aim 3: Evaluate the context of
implementation by examining acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness among Veterans and care team
members, and quantifying intervention-specific personnel-related costs. Based on the Implementation
Outcomes framework, the current study will use primarily qualitative methodology for aim 3.
 Methodology: The current study is a hybrid efficacy-implementation design to facilitate a more rapid move
toward broad-based dissemination and uptake of the PePS program. For Aim 1 and 2 we will utilize a single-
blind, two-arm, parallel, randomized control trial. Participants will include 400 Veterans scheduled at the Iowa
City or Minneapolis VAs for unilateral primary total joint arthroplasty. Participants will be randomized to PePS
or SC. The PePS program includes 4 telephone sessions: Session one will be preoperative and include an
introduction to relaxation and the importance of interpretation in the pain experience. Session two (two weeks
postoperative) will include: review of relaxation and the connection between thoughts/interpretation and pain,
and introduction to thought records. Session three will include review of thought records and relaxation and
introduction to goal-setting and cognitive restructuring. Session four will include: review and creating a plan for
continued use of skills. Primary and secondary outcomes will be measured for 6 weeks post-surgery
(medications only), and at 3 months, and 6 months post-surgery (all other outcomes). Six-months will be the
primary endpoint for pain, mood, and functioning. Multivariate logistic regression will be employed to determine
the relationship between treatment arm and the dichotomous outcome: moderate to severe pain at 6-months
post-surgery. Survival analyses will be used to determine time to opioid (and other analgesic) cessation.
 Aim 3 will assess acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, and estimate costs associated with subsequent
implementation. This will include qualitative interviews with both Veteran surgical patients and surgery clinic
staff (surgeons, nurses, and clerks) at both sites. We will use micro-costing to quantify work time.
 Implementation/Next Steps: These findings will be used to inform subsequent implementation work of the
PePS program within the VA healthcare system."

10885096,"ABSTRACT
 This research program integrates concepts of biology, physics, and applied mathematics to produce
new understanding connecting cell force generation and transmission to migration. A major area of focus
is collective cell migration, which underlies essential processes in development of tissues and progression
of disease. The long-term vision of this research program is to apply experiment-informed computational
models to predict how biochemical perturbations will affect the collective migration. Such models would
enable design of methods to control the collective migration, which would lead to therapies with important
impacts on human health, such as healing of chronic wounds, slowing invasion of cancer cells, and
engineering tissues of desired size and shape.
 Achieving this modeling capability requires a biophysical approach, because the motion results from
physical forces that are produced by the cells in response to biological signaling and transmitted across
the cell layer. Although there exist methods to measure the forces, the common methods used are often
uninformative for physics-based models of collective motion or for studies of the biochemical signaling that
produces the forces. Thus, there is a need to improve upon current methods and to develop new methods
to quantify forces while simultaneously connecting to both the physics-based models and the underlying
biology. The goals for this 5-year MIRA award are to advance methods in quantifying cell forces in both in
vitro and in vivo systems and to apply those methods to build frameworks that enable modeling the
relationships between biochemical signaling, forces, and motion in collective cell migration.
 To accomplish these goals, the research will take two parallel approaches. One approach will improve
upon currently available experimental methods to measure forces produced by each cell, including the
variation of those forces in space and time. The other approach will develop a new methodology for
quantifying cell forces by integrating methods of data science with physics. Importantly, this new
methodology will be able to infer cell forces from only images of the cells, meaning it can be applied in
complicated cell culture systems and even in vivo. The two approaches will be used to study the collective
migration by organizing the research around two complementary frameworks: the first will study collective
motion by focusing on the forces associated with local rearrangements between neighboring cells; the
second will determine how motion is coordinated across multicellular groups. Together, these two
frameworks will provide a means to organize observations about collective migration into a holistic
understanding, which will hint at the underlying biological mechanisms and provide an essential step
forward towards achieving experiment-informed computational models that can predict the collective
migration in applications such as wound healing, cancer invasion, and tissue engineering."
10920395,"A simple arithmetic of life is this: if cells in a tissue divide more frequently than they die, the tissue grows; if
cells die more frequently than they divide, the tissue shrinks. This basic principle is enshrined as a “hallmark”
of cancer—for a cancer to exist it must evade cell death mechanisms that would shift this equation to attrition.
For three decades my laboratory has worked to understand the core pathways of regulated cell death and how
they are controlled at the molecular level. This program of research, the continuation of which is proposed in
this application, explores the processes of regulated cell death in the forms of apoptosis and necroptosis, and
seeks to understand how they are tied to other cellular physiologies, as they must be. Three general goals of
this research are outlined as questions, as follows. A. What are the mechanisms of cell survival in
apoptosis/necroptosis and how do these integrate with cell life? Here we use the concept of “persisters,” cells
that survive the activation of core apoptotic or necroptotic pathways, to probe the pathways that, when
engaged, restrict these core pathways to enable transient resistance to the stimulus. We prioritize our “hits”
based on those whose expression correlates with patient outcome in cancer databases, including the TCGA
and St. Jude Pediatric Genome Project. These are tested in cancer xenograft models. B. How do diverse
processes of cellular life integrate with the core mechanisms of apoptosis? The mitochondrial pathway of
apoptosis is generally known to depend on the activation of the Bcl-2 family effectors, Bax and Bak by BH3-
only proteins. We will continue to explore alternative mechanisms of mitochondrial permeabilization and how
they are regulated by components of the cellular physiology. Prioritization and testing is as above. C. How do
diverse processes of cellular life integrate with the mechanisms of necroptosis? Necroptosis is a form of
regulated necrosis that is actively inhibited by the action of a caspase, normally associated with apoptosis (but
here with cell survival). We will continue our studies into the activation and regulation of necroptosis in relation
to cellular physiology and develop tools to probe its activation in the context of cancer and other pathologies.
While the understanding of the core pathways of cell death have led to one approved cancer therapeutic, our
continued “life and death” efforts set the stage for future success in this critical arena."
10904007,"Picornaviruses cause a wide range of significant human and animal diseases, including poliomyelitis, hepatitis,
encephalitis, myocarditis, and the common cold. Since they are among the most genetically simple of all RNA
viruses, members of the picornavirus family must usurp host cell functions and modify the cytoplasmic
environment to facilitate viral translation, RNA replication, and virion biogenesis. Among the many ways that
picornaviruses alter host cell functions is by re-localizing them from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where viral
replication takes place. The nuclear versus cytoplasmic separation of the major processes that lead to the
expression of protein-coding genes in eukaryotes requires a complex transport process that allows RNAs and
proteins to move between these two cellular compartments. The Picornaviridae family is one of several virus
families that disrupt the nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking of cells to promote viral replication. Viral proliferation
requires the activity of host RNA-binding proteins that normally function in cellular gene expression and are
primarily localized to the nucleus. Picornaviruses alter nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking to exploit these and other
nuclear proteins that are subsequently delivered to the cytoplasm to facilitate efficient viral replication. Our
recently-published analysis of the nuclear versus cytoplasmic proteome in human rhinovirus-infected cells has
established the identities of a large cohort of nuclear proteins that re-localize to the cytoplasm during infection.
In this application, state-of-the-art molecular and cell biology experiments are proposed to determine the
functional significance of this protein redistribution on human rhinovirus replication, focusing on nuclear RNA
binding proteins involved in mRNA splicing/processing and 3’ polyadenylation. A global analysis of protein
distribution during rhinovirus infection of different human lung cell lines by quantitative mass spectrometry is also
proposed to uncover novel virus-host interactions that may be respiratory cell-type specific. Results from these
studies should reveal novel mechanistic insights into how a respiratory virus like human rhinovirus co-opts
specific host nuclear functions and how these functions are altered or re-purposed for specific steps in viral
replication. Detailed knowledge of such interactions, particularly at essential interfaces between host proteins
and viral proteins and/or viral RNA sequences, promises to reveal new targets for antiviral therapies."
10912656,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Background. Chronic neck pain is one of leading determinants of disability worldwide, a major contributor to the
current opioid epidemic, and the cause of enormous health care expenditures. We currently do not understand
which molecular mechanisms in the diseased tissues of the neck generate the painful signals that cause this
disease burden. This gap in knowledge impedes development of effective, mechanism-specific therapeutics.
Aim. We plan to use RNA sequencing on tissues taken from chronic neck pain patients undergoing surgery and
then use computational biology and patient phenotyping techniques to gain better insight into molecular drivers
that cause chronic neck pain.
Approach. We will recruit patients undergoing surgery for chronic neck pain stemming from the atlanto-axial
joint. This joint is located between the 1st and 2nd cervical vertebrae on both sides of the spine and is a common
site of arthritis. We will also recruit patients undergoing the same surgery for acute pain due to fractures. During
surgery, we will sample tissues from the joint and the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), in which the nerves supplying
the joint are located. These tissues would be removed during surgery in chronic pain patients, independent of
the study. For acute pain patients we will use our existing dorsal root ganglion database of people with no pain.
We will perform RNA sequencing on samples from both sides, in order to compare tissues from painful and non-
painful side of the same individual. We will record clinical pain characteristics, measure pain sensitivity and
assess nerve function using pinprick, pressure and cold stimuli. We will also use computational biology methods
to assess how diseased tissue interacts with the nervous system to drive pain. These methods will allow us to
identify targets that are related to pain outcomes.
Aim 1: To determine the RNA expression profile of the joint tissues and DRG from acute and chronic pain
patients to determine genes that are differentially expressed in chronic neck pain tissues.
Aim 2: To use computational biology techniques to determine how pathological molecules originating in the joint
tissues interact with specific receptors on neurons of the DRG to generate the pain signal.
Aim 3: To determine the association of RNA sequencing findings in the joint and nerves with clinical
manifestations of neck pain, pain sensitivity and nerve function. This will provide information on which molecular
changes at the joint and nerves are of specific importance to pain.
Impact. The project will enable unprecedented identification of molecular pathways specifically associated with
chronic neck pain. Our work will create a unique map of molecular targets for the future treatment of chronic
neck pain based entirely on human molecular neuroscience."
10828903,"100.7 PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
Amidst the ongoing opioid and polysubstance use epidemics, HIV transmission attributed to injection drug use
is threatening decades of HIV prevention progress in the United States. HIV testing and subsequent
engagement in HIV prevention and care services are suboptimal among people who inject drugs (PWID) due
to multilevel barriers including low healthcare utilization, stigma, homelessness, and limited transportation. HIV
self-testing (HIVST) is a discreet, convenient, and empowering HIV testing strategy with great potential to
increase HIV testing coverage among PWID. Syringe service programs (SSPs), which successfully promote
the secondary distribution (i.e., peer delivery) of sterile syringes, naloxone, and other harm reduction supplies,
are uniquely poised to increase the reach of HIVST into the social networks of their clients (i.e., PWID).
Leveraging our existing partnership with the Inland Empire Harm Reduction (IEHR) SSP in the Ending the HIV
Epidemic (EHE) priority jurisdiction of Riverside County (RC), California, this project seeks to develop and
evaluate the “Prevention Ambassadors” (PA) intervention to promote HIV testing and engagement in HIV
prevention and care services among PWID via the secondary distribution of HIVST kits with local HIV service
information and referrals to HIV service navigation (hereafter “HIVST plus information/referrals”) in the social
networks of SSP clients. This novel intervention, informed by the Diffusion of Innovations (DOI) theory, adapts
effective social network-based HIV prevention interventions for PWID to extend IEHR’s secondary distribution
of sterile syringes and naloxone (i.e., IEHR standard of care; SOC) to include HIVST plus information/referrals.
In this two-phase project, we will first engage in an iterative process with PWID and SSP/HIV service providers
in RC to adapt, pretest, and refine PA to train PWID (indexes) to distribute HIVST plus information/referrals to
other PWID in their social networks (peer-recruits; AIM 1). Next, we will pilot PA with 50 indexes randomized
1:1 to PA or SOC to examine the preliminary effect of PA (vs. SOC) on indexes’ and ~100 peer-recruits’ HIV
testing and HIV service engagement outcomes (linkage to PrEP/HIV care, PrEP/ART uptake; AIM 2); explore
whether individual and social network characteristics modify the effects of PA (AIM 3); and explore PA
acceptability, feasibility, and areas for refinement among indexes, peer-recruits, and local SSP/HIV service
providers using a mixed-methods approach (AIM 4). Outcomes will be assessed via surveys, medical records,
and qualitative interviews. Findings will support a future R01 efficacy trial and potential PA dissemination to
other SSPs nationally to accelerate efforts to end the HIV epidemic among PWID."

Older adults with substance use disorders are at high risk for associated adverse outcomes due to co-existing
chronic diseases and functional impairments. This is also a population that has experienced a profound loss of
their social networks and is therefore also at risk for social isolation and loneliness. Additionally, older adults
with substance use disorder also experience a high level of stigma related to drug use, drug use treatment,
and ageism. Recently, there has been increasing interest in the relationship between lack of social
connectedness and stigma with health outcomes. Yet, very little research in this area has focused on older
adults with substance use disorders. To address this, the objective of this research is to use the national
expertise of the Principal Investigators (Drs. Han and Inagaki) to measure social isolation, loneliness, and
intersectional stigma longitudinally among older adults who receive care in opioid treatment programs and
examine how this may influence health outcomes. Aim 1 of this study is to characterize trajectories of social
isolation and loneliness longitudinally. 150 older adults (age ³55) living with opioid use disorder who receive
treatment in San Diego County’s opioid treatment programs will be recruited to complete validated measures of
social isolation and loneliness at three-time points (baseline, 6 months, and 12 months later). Aim 2 will
examine whether trajectories of social isolation and loneliness predict 12-month opioid use disorder treatment
outcomes, non-opioid psychoactive substance use, and acute healthcare utilization. Finally, Aim 3, through
qualitative interviews with a subset of enrolled participants (n=40), will explore patient perspectives on how
social isolation and loneliness influence substance use, recovery, and treatment and elicit perspectives on
strategies to address social connectedness through opioid treatment programs. As an exploratory aim, this
study will measure the experienced stigma of this population through validated scales. During qualitative
interviews, perspectives regarding stigma related to opioid use disorder, ageism, and other potentially related
factors will also be assessed. Results from this research will ultimately inform future interventions to address
isolation and disconnection among older adults with opioid use disorder. This will have additional public health
implications for the efficacy of improving addiction treatment and health outcomes."
10916404,"Project Summary / Abstract
 Glycans, heterogeneous polymers of carbohydrates, interact with proteins to initiate a multitude of biologi-
cal processes, including molecular recognition, cellular signaling, and host-microbe interactions. Mass spec-
trometry (MS) methods have become powerful tools for characterizing the structures of glycans and their inter-
actions with proteins. Electrospray ionization (ESI) is a common ionization method for transferring these bio-
molecules from solution to the gas-phase for MS analysis. However, both glycans and proteins exhibit struc-
tural changes during ESI. Thus, there is a critical need to understand how biomolecular structures are modified
during and after the ESI process to determine (1) how researchers can deduce solvated structures from these
techniques and (2) how analytical methods can be improved.
 To address this challenge, the Gallagher lab uses a combination of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
and MS methods to develop a fundamental, molecular perspective of ESI. The Gallagher lab performs MD
simulations of ESI to observe carbohydrate ionization using metal ions as charge carriers. However, to more
accurately model protein ionization, the Gallagher lab is developing methods to simulate protonation during
ESI. These methods will be further developed to examine analyte ionization by deprotonation in negative-ion
mode, and then applied to achieve a molecular perspective on the ionization of glycans and proteins. In paral-
lel to the MD simulations, the Gallagher lab will perform MS analysis of metal-adducted glycans. Glycans
readily ionize by coordinating to metal ions, with different metal-adducts enabling isomeric differentiation in
both tandem MS and ion mobility-MS. However, glycans are often analyzed as sodium adducts because so-
dium is a ubiquitous contaminant. The Gallagher lab is performing systematic studies examining the relation-
ship between metal-ion properties and glycan characterization by MS. Finally, the Gallagher lab is applying
native MS to characterize protein complexes. In native MS, noncovalent interactions are maintained in the
gas phase; yet past work has suggested that proteins analyzed as positive versus negative ions have differ-
ences in gas-phase stability. The Gallagher lab will examine how charging in ESI to form either positive or neg-
ative ions is related to gas-phase protein structure, stability, and ligand-binding interactions.
 The overarching goal of the Gallagher lab is to develop and apply novel methodologies to characterize gly-
cans, proteins, and their binding interactions. The research described in this proposal is significant because it
will provide a fundamental perspective on ESI-MS and the molecular insights from this research will enable the
rational development of future ESI-MS methods for characterizing these molecules. Ultimately, this work will
facilitate the analysis of glycans, glycoconjugates, and protein complexes in cell biology and disease states,
enabling these methods to be applied to address important biological hypotheses."

Heart failure, the main clinical and public health problem, accounts for 13% of deaths in the US. Although
transplantation is currently the only therapy for end-stage heart failure, the availability and compatibility of donor
hearts cannot meet the clinical demand. Bioengineered whole hearts generated by using either 3D-printed or
native scaffolds hold promise to alleviate the donor organ shortage. However, efforts to build a functional
bioartificial heart chamber by using human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are stymied by the immaturity
of hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. Reliable incubation systems that deliver physiologically mimetic stimulation
to train immature heart muscle cells and develop heart tissues are warranted. Without closing this technological
gap, cardiovascular tissue engineering will not advance to organ-level engineering, foreclosing the clinical and
discovery potential. The long-term goal of this research endeavor is to engineer a transplantable heart by using
human cells. In this Katz R01 grant, we propose a new research direction to address the long-standing need
for bioreactor cultivation and stimulation technologies completely reimagined for bioartificial organ engineering.
Our central hypothesis is that integrating the different maturation approaches in one automated platform will
achieve the physiologically relevant levels of function in bioengineered left ventricles. The objective is to
engineer a recellularized left ventricle with a physiologically significant ejection fraction through the integration
of mechanical, electrical, and metabolic stimuli: enable coordinated mechanical and electrical stimulation in a
recellularized left ventricle through a novel multiparametric bioreactor design (Aim 1) and develop a whole organ
media composition to support the increased metabolic demands of larger bioartificial left ventricles (Aim 2).
Based on our unparalleled experience in regenerative medicine, we will develop the coordinated heart
stimulation testbed (CHeST) combined with a novel artificial oxygen carrier and metabolic media
supplementation tailor-fitted to the biophysical, biochemical, and metabolic requirements of developing
contractile tissue. The expected deliverables of a contractile ventricle construct and multiparametric stimulation
bioreactor will vertically advance the field, providing essential novel contributions to the issues impairing cardiac
tissue engineering for generating bioengineered ventricles. Mechanistic discovery and bioengineering
improvements will abound as other investigators create stimulation training protocols for the heart and other
engineered organs. Thus the realization of this project will pave the way for a potential new wave of
breakthroughs in cardiac tissue engineering toward building a bioartificial heart."
10917195,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Approximately 10% of neonates require assistance to begin breathing after birth. At-risk neonates, i.e., those
requiring advanced resuscitation due to prematurity, brain injury, or other conditions, are at increased risk of
mortality when born in a hospital without a neonatal intensive care unit (‘outborn’) compared to at-risk neonates
born in a hospital with a NICU (‘inborn’). Furthermore, at-risk outborn neonates are more likely to suffer serious
morbidity, e.g., pneumothorax, severe intraventricular hemorrhage (sIVH), and seizures, and receive
cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the delivery room. We estimate that there are 10,000-15,000 at-risk outborn
neonates each year who experience poorer health outcomes due to their birth location. However, there are
limited strategies to optimize the resuscitation of at-risk neonates born in community hospitals that lack higher
levels of neonatal care. There is a critical need to improve patient-important outcomes for this population. The
overall objectives in this application are to (i) determine the impact of real-time, audio-video telemedicine consults
provided by a neonatologist (termed teleneonatology) on the risk of early mortality and morbidity for at-risk
outborn neonates, and (ii) evaluate the effect of teleneonatology on delivery room care provided to these
neonates. The central hypothesis is that teleneonatology reduces early mortality and morbidity and improves
delivery room care for at-risk outborn neonates. The rationale for this project is that teleneonatology brings
resuscitation expertise to the bedside of at-risk neonates more effectively than a brief telephone consult, which
is the current practice. Through teleneonatology, the neonatologist can visualize the neonate and provide step-
by-step guidance to the community hospital care team. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three
specific aims: 1) Determine the impact of teleneonatology on the risk of early neonatal mortality (death within 7
days), 2) Identify the effect teleneonatology has on the risk of early morbidity (defined as pneumothorax, sIVH,
or seizure during the first 7 days of life), and 3) Evaluate the impact of teleneonatology on delivery room care.
The three aims are embedded into a single prospective, multi-center research trial. With sequential roll-out of
the intervention using a cluster randomized stepped wedge design, neonatologists from four NICU ‘hub’ sites
will provide teleneonatology consults to at-risk outborn neonates born at 27 community hospital ‘spoke’ sites.
Completion of the proposed research will contribute the first-ever, high quality evidence on the impact of
teleneonatology on neonatal health outcomes. The research is innovative because it uses video telemedicine
to connect neonatologists exactly when needed to at-risk outborn neonates in a way that was not previously
possible. This project is significant because it may identify an innovative care model that reduces the long-
standing outcome disparities experienced by at-risk outborn neonates."

Humans can rapidly regulate actions according to updated demands of the environment. A key component of
action regulation is action inhibition, the failure of which contributes to various neuropsychiatric diseases, such
as Parkinson’s disease (PD), obsessive compulsive disorder and Tourette syndrome. Action inhibition occurs in
at least 3 ways: (i) action selection – selecting one action requires suppressing alternative motor plans, (ii)
outright stopping – inhibiting a response when it is rendered inappropriate and (iii) action switching – change
action plans in response to environmental changes. Despite the extensive effort to understand how the brain
selects, stops and switches actions, the mechanism underlying these action regulation functions, and more
importantly, how they inter-relate remain elusive. Part of this challenge lies in the fact that studies rarely explore,
characterize, and investigate these functions together, making it difficult to develop a unified theory that explains
the computational aspects of action regulation. The current proposal aims to advance our understanding by
developing a neurocomputational model that, unlike prior models, integrates information from multiple sources
(e.g., value of targets, cost for changing an action, contextual information) and predicts both kinematics of motor
behavior and the underpinning neural mechanisms across 3 distinct types of action regulation. We will directly
evaluate model predictions with intracranial recordings in patient volunteers undergoing deep brain stimulation
implantation surgeries. These surgeries provide a unique opportunity to obtain multi-focal cortical and basal
ganglia (BG) recordings with high temporal and spectral resolution and spatial specificity across the three action
regulation tasks. The overarching goal will be achieved through three aims. In Aim 1, we will collect behavioral
data from PD patients and aged-match neurotypical participants performing tasks that involves selecting,
stopping and switching reaching actions. The motor behavior of the neurotypical group will be used to develop
a neurocomputational model that simulate the fronto-BG circuits in action regulation. Then, we will assess how
specific changes on the neural mechanisms of the model architecture predict the motor behavior of the PD
patients. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the model predictions about the mechanisms of action selection relative to
stopping by recording neural activity from PD patients who undergo surgery for DBS implantation of the
subthalamic nucleus (STN). Neural recordings will be collected without and with temporally and spatially precise
subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation to investigate the causal role of STN in action selection. In Aim 3, we will
evaluate the model predictions about the mechanisms for switching actions by recording neural activity from PD
patients with the STN stimulation off and on. Overall, successful completion will provide a unified theory of action
regulation in the human brain, with both behavioral and physiological validation, opening new avenues on
improving the effectiveness of neuromodulation with DBS and other neurorestorative therapies."
10851869,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Fleas are obligate vectors of bacterial pathogens that cause severe diseases in humans, including murine typhus
and bubonic plague. To resist or limit infection, fleas possess an innate immune system that provides defense
against microbial invasion and colonization. However, in their natural habitats, flea populations are made up of
individuals that differ not only their genetic background, but also in regard to factors such as sex, age, diet,
infection history, gut microbiota, and exposure to environmental stressors. These non-genetic factors have been
shown to have important consequences on the outcome of infection in other disease vectors; yet, no studies to
date have addressed the impact of these ecological parameters on flea immune responses. The proposed
research aims to fill these knowledge gaps in flea ecological immunology, with the primary goals being to
determine the intrinsic factors that affect the antibacterial response in adults, and to determine the effect of larval
ecology on subsequent infections as adults. Specifically, we propose to compare the strength of immune defense
mechanisms in adult cat fleas (Ctenocephalides felis) based on sex, age, and infection history (Specific Aim 1),
as well as following larval exposure to food quantity, larval density, and insecticides (Specific Aim 2). This project
will provide valuable insight into the variability of flea immunity under natural conditions, which can directly affect
pathogen transmission dynamics and alter disease prevalence outcomes within a vector population. Data arising
from this project could aid in the development of novel strategies to control the spread of flea-borne pathogens
to humans."

 Sexual minority women (e.g., lesbian, bisexual, queer women) and gender diverse (e.g., non-binary)
sexual minorities assigned female at birth are at elevated risk for cannabis use disorder (CUD) compared to
heterosexual women. Alarmingly, rates of CUD are increasing for sexual minority women and gender diverse
individuals (SMWGD) as well as heterosexual women, with more rapid increases among SMWGD leading to
growing disparities in CUD. This highlights the urgent need for CUD research in both populations.
 Examining event-level risk processes clarifies the temporal order of risk factors and CU in near-real time.
However, ecological momentary assessment (EMA) studies, including our own, provide mixed evidence for two
sets of risk factors for CU: risk factors related to increasing positive affect (positive reinforcement; e.g.,
enhancement motives, social use) and decreasing negative affect (negative reinforcement; e.g., coping
motives, solitary use). SMWGD also experience unique positive and negative reinforcement risk factors (e.g.,
CU with SMWGD; minority stress). Providing a potential explanation for mixed evidence, our preliminary
results and the multistage model of substance use suggest these two sets of risk factors may be relevant at
different stages of CUD, with positive reinforcement most relevant when CUD symptoms are absent to mild
and negative reinforcement becoming dominant when CUD symptoms become more severe. We propose to
empirically test a theoretical model that incorporates the multistage model and unique risk factors for SMWGD.
We will use a measurement burst design, with 5 semi-annual bursts of 14-days of EMA (2 surveys per day),
allowing us to examine changes in event-level effects of risk factors on CU as a function of longer-term (i.e.,
semi-annual) changes in CUD symptoms. We will include SMWGD and heterosexual women, allowing us to
identify similarities and differences in effects of shared risk factors on CU for these two groups, determine if
differences in CU trajectories contribute to CUD disparities, and identify unique risk factors for SMWGD.
 The purpose of this R01 is to advance our understanding of CUD among SMWGD and heterosexual
women, with a focus on how event-level associations between risk factors and CU change as CUD develops.
We will use a measurement burst design, with 400 SMWGD and 200 heterosexual women (age 18-25) who
use cannabis at least weekly. The proposed study will accomplish three specific aims: 1) identify changes in
the effects of event-level risk factors on CU as CUD develops, 2) test for differences in effects of shared event-
level risk factors on CU for SMWGD and heterosexual women, and 3) determine if differences in CU
trajectories for SMWGD and heterosexual women contribute to disparities in the development of CUD. The
proposed study will inform efforts to increase efficacy of existing CUD interventions for heterosexual women
and determine which risk factors should be targeted in interventions for SMWGD. The proposed study is in
response to NOT-MD-19-001 and NIDA priorities to understand substance use disparities affecting SMWGD."

 Natural metabolic diversity is generated through the evolution of novel function in enzymes
(neofunctionalization). Society uses this metabolic diversity to obtain many high-value chemicals, such
as microbial and plant-derived pharmaceuticals, but harnessing this chemistry relies on discovery of the
underlying biosynthetic machinery. While some biosynthetic enzymes are readily identifiable, there are
many metabolic reactions with no defined enzyme family, and this acts as a roadblock to elucidating
new metabolic pathways. My lab studies enzymes and chemical reactions from the natural world, with
a focus on identifying biosynthetic genes and pathways in medicinal plants. We are particularly
interested in finding new enzymes that expand the ‘catalog’ of known metabolic protein families.
Recently, we identified several α-carbonic anhydrase (CAH)-like proteins that have neofunctionalized
to catalyze novel scaffold-forming reactions in the biosynthesis of neuroactive plant compounds. While
these are the first CAH family proteins shown to act as biosynthetic enzymes, we predict that
neofunctionalized CAHs (neo-CAHs) have critical, undefined functions in metabolism more broadly.
 Over the next five years, my lab will advance a fundamental understanding of neo-CAHs by
providing a mechanistic basis on their enzymatic function and by investigating the breadth and diversity
of neo-CAH enzymes throughout nature. While canonical CAHs are very well-studied, the biochemical
properties of neo-CAHs are yet to be defined. We will study the foundational biochemistry and catalytic
mechanisms of the neo-CAHs through enzymatic characterization, structural biology, and analysis of
native post-translational modifications and sub-cellular localization. This work will provide a mechanistic
understanding of neo-CAH enzyme catalysis and will yield basic insight into novel chemistry used to
produce bioactive plant molecules. Simultaneously, we will investigate the widespread occurrence of
neo-CAHs throughout nature. Each neo-CAH identified thus far has mutations in conserved active site
residues that are essential for canonical CAH function. Similar mutations are found in other
uncharacterized CAH family proteins within plants, bacteria, and animals, suggesting that CAHs have
unappreciated biosynthetic functions in multiple kingdoms of life. We will leverage these distinguishing
mutations to identify and functionally characterize other neo-CAH enzymes - including homologs from
medicinal plants, microbes, and humans - to better define the metabolic capacity of this protein family.
Through this work, we will a) provide insight on a previously unknown class of metabolic enzyme that
likely has broader biosynthetic roles in nature, and b) further determine how conserved enzymes can
gain new function to yield the striking structural and functional diversity of natural metabolites."
10867353,"Colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world. Sarcopenia, defined as a loss of
skeletal muscle mass and function, is highly prevalent in colorectal cancer, with rates of up to 60% reported.
Sarcopenia etiology in cancer is multifactorial, with aging and inactivity compounded by treatment toxicities,
malnutrition, tumor burden, and high-grade inflammation. Consequently, it’s unlikely that unimodal
interventions will be sufficient to overcome the burden of sarcopenia in this population. Creatine monohydrate
is a naturally occurring compound in the body that plays a critical role in energy provision during exercise.4
Creatine is the most widely studied nutritional supplement to date, with well over 1,000 studies establishing its
safety and effectiveness in men, women and older adults, in addition to other clinical populations. There is
strong and consistent evidence that creatine supplementation can enhance the positive adaptations to
resistance training in older adults and clinical populations. Therefore, there is strong potential for the
application of creatine and resistance training to offset the decline in muscle mass and function after cancer
treatment. The purpose of the proposed study is to examine the feasibility and acceptability of creatine
supplementation combined with resistance exercise, compared to resistance exercise alone in individuals
treated for colorectal cancer who are sarcopenic. We propose a randomized controlled pilot trial, examining the
effects of 10-week multimodal resistance exercise and creatine supplementation (EXSUPP) (n=20) relative to
resistance exercise alone (EXPLA) (n=20) in individuals treated for colorectal cancer who have sarcopenia.
The specific aims of this project are to 1) determine the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention in
colorectal cancer patients? diagnosed with sarcopenia after cancer treatment, 2) compare the effects of an
exercise and creatine supplementation intervention (EXSUPP) to exercise alone (EXPLA) on body
composition, muscle strength, physical function, and quality of life and 3) explore muscle molecular-level
adaptations, i.e., mitochondrial health and protein turnover, in response to the interventions. This project will be
one of the first to combine exercise with creatine, specifically targeting sarcopenia in individuals previously
treated for colorectal cancer. This project is directly in line with the priority research initiative from the NCI
Cancer MoonshotSM to “minimize Cancer Treatment’s Debilitating Side Effects.” Our trial is innovative in
addressing one of the most important health problems for individuals treated for colorectal cancer in that it will
be the first to 1) examine the feasibility and acceptability of a multimodal exercise and nutritional intervention
relative to exercise alone in individuals treated for colorectal cancer who are sarcopenic and 2) explore the
molecular mechanisms underpinning the response to exercise and nutritional interventions."
10898823,"Project Summary/Abstract
Unlike most other organs and tissues, the endometrium of the adult uterus has a remarkable regenerative ability,
undergoing repetitive cycles of proliferation, differentiation, breakdown, and regeneration. The endometrium is a
complex tissue comprised of stroma, vasculature and immune cells, as well as two major epithelial cell types —
luminal (LE) and glandular (GE) epithelium. Notably, the endometrium repairs after menstruation, injury, and
childbirth without scarring and then regenerates with full function to support pregnancy. Aberrations in
regeneration negatively impacts pregnancy success and can lead to infertility or diseases, such as
endometriosis, endometrial fibroids, Asherman’s syndrome, and endometrial cancer. Thus, the long-term
research objective is to define the critical intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms governing uterine epithelial cell
differentiation and regeneration with subsequent impacts to diagnose, treat, and prevent infertility and
endometrial disease in women. The regenerative capacity and ability to grow ectopically (endometriosis)
suggests that the endometrium has a robust and plastic progenitor population. Indeed, numerous reports have
provided evidence that cells with stem cell-like qualities exist in the epithelium of the uterus; however, the identity,
behavior, and mechanisms underlying the fate of those cells and their location remains unclear. Ambiguity within
the uterine stem cell field may be partly because the strict lineage hierarchies that characterize development and
homeostatic tissue turnover are not followed during tissue repair. Recent studies in several organs found that
epithelial plasticity and activation of facultative stem cells are common strategies for tissue regeneration in the
injury repair process. Therefore, this proposal focuses more on the process used by the uterus to replace lost
cells, rather than on the physical entity of a stem cell. The overarching hypothesis is that the uterine epithelium
contains cells that are unipotent during normal homeostatic turnover but have the ability to dedifferentiate upon
injury to coordinate successful epithelial regeneration. Guided by strong preliminary data and the use of
innovative mouse genetic models, organoid culture, and single-cell sequencing technologies, two specific aims
will begin testing that hypothesis: (1) epithelial plasticity in the regenerating uterus; and (2) cellular and molecular
aspects of LE response to GE ablation. The outcome of the proposed studies will connect epithelial regeneration
responses to specific molecular mechanisms of epithelial differentiation and repair. In the long term, an increased
understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern endometrial epithelial cell differentiation
and regeneration is important not only for gaining fundamental knowledge of tissue and stem cell biology but
also for the development of therapeutics for the treatment of endometrial diseases."

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that afflicts
nearly 1 million people in the United States alone. While MS is classically regarded as a white matter disease,
gray matter lesion load may exceed that of the white matter in patients with MS. The pathological features of
lesions differ between gray and white matter lesions. Interestingly, in lesions that span white and gray matter
regions, display pathological hallmarks of white matter-only lesions, suggesting that cellular environments
distinctly regulate oligodendrocyte loss and regeneration. Furthermore, attempts at remyelination are more
frequent in cortical versus white matter lesions regardless of patient age or disease duration. These findings
suggest that remyelination of gray matter regions may be specifically limited by decreased functional integration
of new oligodendrocytes compared to white matter regions. Understanding the regional differences in
oligodendrocyte loss and regeneration represents a clear unmet need in the MS research community. A major
limitation to understanding these regional differences is the inability to monitor the dynamics of oligodendrocytes
in white matter in the living brain. To overcome this obstacle, we will use new optical methodologies to determine
regional variability in oligodendrocyte cell behavior. We propose to use the superior penetration depth of three-
photon excitation fluorescence and longitudinal in vivo imaging to determine the effects of circuit-specific
neuronal activity and demyelinating injury on oligodendrocyte lineage cells in both superficial and deep areas of
the adult brain. The objectives of this proposal are: 1) evaluate how behaviorally-relevant neuronal activity
regulates gray and white matter oligodendrogenesis, 2) to elucidate whether behavioral interventions can equally
promote oligodendrocyte regeneration of the gray and white matter. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is
region-specific rates of oligodendrocyte precursor differentiation and integration govern the proportion of
myelination in healthy, adaptive, and regenerative contexts. This proposal represents a novel synthesis of
cutting-edge approaches in optical physics and oligodendrocyte biology, and breaks new ground in
understanding the mechanisms underlying the regulation of gray and white matter oligodendrocyte plasticity and
regeneration."

as exemplified by the mechanisms underlying the severe inflammatory manifestations revealed by the COVID-
19 pandemic. The “Signaling Pathways in Innate Immunity” (SPII) training program (TP) for pre- and postdoc-
toral trainees completed its 10th year in August 2022, and this revised application requests continued funding
for years 11-15. The University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) has significant research and training
strengths in this area. The 33 Training Grant Faculty (TGF) for this uniquely focused TP are highly interactive
and primarily from the Department of Microbiology & Immunology, with affiliations in interdisciplinary centers
and institutes (e.g., Center for Vaccine Development, Institute for Genome Sciences, Center for Vascular and
Inflammatory Diseases, and the Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center). Our TGF are well-funded and
have a long history of collaboration on grants and publications. Predoctoral trainees are selected from a strong
applicant pool, including entrants from the UMSOM M.D./Ph.D. Program, within the Graduate Program in Life
Sciences Molecular Microbiology & Immunology (MMI) Program. Training includes a rigorous, multidisciplinary
core curriculum, program-specific courses, elective courses, journal clubs, seminars, annual symposia, and
graduate research forums. Additional academic work will be combined with intensive laboratory training
through dissertation research under the direction of the TGF whose expertise will provide inter- and multidisci-
plinary training opportunities. SPII TP-eligible postdoctoral fellows are increasingly gravitating to laboratories
with expertise in innate immune signaling where they receive dedicated mentoring using state-of-the art re-
sources and innovative opportunities to attain new skills in an academically challenging environment. Pre- and
postdoctoral trainees have additional mandatory didactic and non-didactic requirements, including training in
the responsible conduct of research, professional development, new “hands on” training modules in our Center
for Innovative Biomedical Research (CIBR) Core facility, and a highly structured mentoring program. Recruit-
ment of trainees from underrepresented minorities is a priority of the SPII TP and is reflected in the diversity of
our pre- and postdoctoral trainees: in Years 1-10, SPII TP trainees were 59.6% women and 22.9% un-
derrepresented minorities. SPII TP is guided by a highly qualified Advisory Board including the TP Director and
3 Co-Directors, 2 senior TGF, and 4 past or current TP Directors. Our TGF support trainee participation in in-
novative new training components in rigor and reproducibility, diversity, equity and inclusion, and outreach to
foster their professional development. Our current trainees are already building impressive records of publica-
tions and awards and SPII alumni are in academic, industry, or government research positions or have contin-
ued postdoctoral or resident training. Their successes to date indicate that SPII trainees are exceptionally well
prepared for scientific careers that will significantly contribute to the nation’s health."
10894156,"The rise in U.S. midlife mortality in recent decades has been substantial, ending the increase in life expectancy
around 2010 and triggering its decline after 2014. The trend has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
One of the most telling features of the rise is its geographic pattern. It has been pronounced in Midwestern and
Southern states and in rural areas and small cities. Explaining these growing geographic disparities is a
necessary step toward identifying the etiologies of rising midlife mortality overall. The overarching objective of
this project is to assess how state policy contexts and county economic contexts collectively predict growing
geographic disparities in 1) all-cause midlife mortality, 2) major trend-driving causes of death for midlife mortality:
suicide, drug overdose, alcohol-induced causes, and cardiometabolic diseases, and 3) psychosocial and health
behavior risk factors for those causes of death The project answers key unresolved questions about the growing
geographic disparities in midlife mortality that have been major obstacles to understanding them. One question
regards the collective influence of state and local contexts. Studies tend to focus on state or local contexts,
providing an incomplete explanation. We advance this work by examining state and local contexts concomitantly,
which is critical because they may affect mortality via independent and synergistic processes. A second question
concerns the influence of states’ policy “contexts”. States have enacted highly correlated, or “bundled”, policies
which necessitates new approaches for understanding their influence on mortality. We advance this work by
using innovative methods to develop annual scores for interpretable policy bundles. A third question concerns
the degree to which state and local contexts collectively predict individual-level psychosocial wellbeing and
health behaviors—i.e., the proximate determinants of the four major causes of death behind rising midlife
mortality. Deindustrialization, declines in good jobs, and concomitant disruptions to families and communities in
some places may have harmed the psychosocial wellbeing of midlife adults, particularly those without a 4-year
college degree, leading to consumption of drugs, alcohol, and unhealthy food. We advance this work by
examining how state and local contexts collectively predict psychosocial and health behavior risk factors for the
four major causes of death. The project will accomplish its objective through three Specific Aims. Aim 1 identifies
how state policy and county economic contexts collectively predict county-level mortality (from all causes and
the four specific causes) from 1990-2025 for all midlife adults and by age, sex, race-ethnicity, education, and
metro status. Aim 2 identifies how state policy and county economic contexts collectively predict individual-level
psychosocial and health behavior risk factors from 2021-2025, and examines hypothesized pathways, among
all midlife adults and by age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, and metro status. Aim 3 merges the 100+ annual
state and county measures into multiple geocoded surveys available via the UM’s Virtual Data Enclave. We will
also disseminate the data, documentation, and code via ICPSR and offer workshops on these resources."

Latinx who do drink are at greater risk for transitioning to substance use disorders and experience more severe
negative consequences. Relative to other racial/ethnic groups, Latinx emerging adults who engage in
problematic drinking are (a) less likely to seek treatment, and (b) have less access to innovative and
accessible health promoting resources, exacerbating health inequities. Increasing evidence supports the utility
of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) for reducing problematic alcohol use and promoting a sustainable
healthy lifestyle. However, research on MBIs to address alcohol use problems is limited by (1) minimal
racial/ethnic minority representation and (2) low rates of program adherence and retention. The long-term goal
of this research is to decrease alcohol misuse among Latinx emerging adult drinkers through a culturally and
developmentally adapted mindfulness-based intervention program targeting self-regulatory processes. The
primary aims of the study are twofold. Primary Aim 1 - Use Community-Based Participatory Research
(CBPR) methods guided by the five stages of cultural adaptations of behavioral health interventions to ensure
a culturally and developmentally appropriate adaptation of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR-L) for
Latinx emerging adults (18-25 years-old) who report 2 or more binge drinking episodes in the prior 30 days.
These formative stages of the research will include an expert advisory panel review, key informant interviews
(n=15), focus groups (n=30) and a pilot trial (n=10; 8-weeks with weekly hour-long adapted MBSR sessions).
Formative data will be analyzed to obtain information on structure, duration, acceptability, and cultural
appropriateness and further refinement of intervention protocols. Primary Aim 2 – Conduct a Cultural
Adaptation Trial to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of the adapted MBSR-L intervention among a
community sample (n=120) of Latinx underage emerging adults who report 2 or more binge drinking episodes
in the prior 30 days. Participants will be randomly assigned to an MBSR-L condition (8 weekly 1-hour adapted
MBSR-L sessions) or an assessment-only control condition. Secondary Aim 2.1 - Examine initial evidence of
the efficacy of the MBSR-L intervention. We hypothesize that, relative to the participants in the control
condition, participants in the MBSR-L condition will report: (a) greater reductions in frequency of binge drinking
episodes and number of drinks per drinking occasion, and (b) greater impacts on putative mechanisms of
change (e.g., reduced stress, greater self-regulation, and enhanced well-being). The proposed study has
significant public health implications by contributing to translational efforts to reduce alcohol misuse
and disparities among Latinx emerging adults who would otherwise not seek treatment."
10913479,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In the mouse retina, about 40 types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) communicate visual information to the rest
of the brain. A great deal of processing takes place before RGCs send their output downstream. Some RGCs
respond selectively to a narrow range of shapes, contrasts, and directions of motion or prefer localized stimuli
that move differentially from their surroundings. These computations are supported by interactions between
more than a hundred interneurons whose interactions give rise to the receptive fields (RFs) that describe the
relationship between the stimulus to the response of the RGC.
However, despite significant recent advances in the field, we still do not know what visual features are detected
by the majority of RGC types. One obstacle to progress is current techniques to study RF composition, which
either require prolonged recording sessions, challenging experimental techniques, or fail to detect crucial RF
components. We are also limited in the conceptual understanding of how neural circuit organization translates
to function and what RF motifs give rise to specific visual computations.
In this proposal, we will take an innovative approach that combines machine learning techniques, biophysically
realistic modeling, electrophysiology, and glutamate / calcium imaging to develop a comprehensive description
of the visual abilities of multiple RGC types in complex visual scenes that is grounded in empirical data.
The proposed research will substantially advance our understanding of basic and advanced response
characteristics of visually active cells, opening new horizons in the examination of neuronal function in and
beyond the retina."

 Medical practice is continuously evolving, with substantial resources allocated to developing medical
innovations and enhancing clinical evidence on new and existing treatments. In most cases, new evidence
supporting approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) demonstrates efficacy of new treatments; after
approval, new evidence for existing treatments may show them to be ineffective or unsafe. Understanding
whether and how new clinical evidence is integrated into practice is critical from the perspectives of a)
improving patient safety and health outcomes; b) addressing racial and socioeconomic equity in access and
use; c) designing programs and policies to encourage use of high value, effective treatments and abandon less
effective and harmful treatments; d) containing health care costs by allocating limited health care budgets to
their most effective use.
 The COVID-19 pandemic provides a unique opportunity to study the diffusion of evidence into practice by
observing adoption and de-adoption behavior of physicians in response to rapidly changing information about
potential treatments and risks of continued use of common drugs in the context of COVID-19. This proposal
builds on our prior work on de-adoption of harmful or ineffective medical practices by introducing additional
factors that could be associated with the rates and timing of adoption and de-adoption of pharmaceutical
treatments. We will examine prescription fills and claims-based use of a targeted set of drugs related to
COVID-19 using data from Medicare claims for Fee-for-Service (FFS) enrollees. COVID-19 has particularly
affected older adults and the disabled and chronically ill, many of whom face increased risk of severe morbidity
and mortality from the disease, and potentially from lack of access to medical care during the pandemic. We
will investigate how prescribing of COVID-19-related drugs responds to state-level drug policies, FDA safety
communications, and COVID-19 pressures on the healthcare system. We will assess how patient
characteristics (e.g., race and ethnicity, age, and key comorbidities), as well as physician and medical practice
organization characteristics are associated with these prescribing patterns.
 Three in-depth COVID-19 case studies will assess uptake and de-adoption of treatments associated with
lower quality evidence and more rapid turnaround in a context where public attention is closely attuned to
every development and pre-print biomedical manuscripts are discussed at length in the popular press.
Exploring adoption and de-adoption of treatments in a context of high uncertainty and high burden and
prevalence of disease will provide important insights into the role of information quality in physician decision
making. In addition, these cases will allow us to explore the effectiveness of state-level regulation of
treatments. In particular, hydroxychloroquine was regulated in some states in response to fears that not
enough would be available for people using the drug to treat non-COVID-19 conditions."

The multidisciplinary UAB Immunology T32 Training Program, “Immunologic Diseases and Basic Immunology”,
is focused on training highly motivated predoctoral students and PhD and MD graduates in the fields of
translational and fundamental immunology. A major strength of the program is the broad expertise and
research interests of its faculty, encompassing stem cell and lymphocyte differentiation; cellular immunology;
molecular immunology; gene organization, structure and function of immunoglobulins, T cell receptors, Fc
receptors, complement, and lymphokines; secretory immunity; transgenic models of immune function;
immunogenetics; host responses to infectious diseases, mucosal immunology, transplantation immunology,
neuroimmunology, and bioinformatics. Seven predoctoral trainees are selected from the graduate students
enrolled in the Graduate Biomedical Sciences Program following successful completion of their first year of
graduate study. Their training will last up to five years. This population includes students in the Medical
Scientist Training Program (MD/PhD program), as well as the newly minted Advance Research training In
SciEnce for MDs program. Three postdoctoral trainees with a MD, PhD or equivalent terminal degree are
selected on the basis of prior academic and research performance, letters of recommendation, and personal
interviews. This population includes physicians pursuing fellowship training in Allergy/Immunology,
Dermatology and Rheumatology. Their training will last up to three years. Because a large number of the
faculty are involved in the care of patients with immunologic diseases in addition to their research programs,
the program provides an interface between basic and applied immunology. Opportunities directly related to
human diseases are available in autoimmune diseases, bioinformatics, vaccine development,
immunodeficiencies, neoplastic diseases, immune-complex diseases, host-defense defects, dental caries,

 Sterols lipids, including cholesterol, are important for mammalian cell physiology. These molecules
modulate the fluidity of biological membranes and are therefore implicated maintaining membrane integrity,
stress tolerance, fusion events, etc. Sterols are also involved in intra- and intercellular signaling and are trafficked
to sub-cellular membranes. Whereas decades of research have provided molecular insights into eukaryotic sterol
synthesis, transport, regulation, and function, similar understanding of sterols is lacking for bacteria and archaea.
While it is thought that archaea do not make or use sterols, some bacteria do make and transport sterols; many
others are known to engage with sterols produced by eukaryotes. These bacteria include the pathogenic
spirochetes (Borrelia burgdorferi, Treponema pallidum), Mycobacteria, Chlamydia, Rickettsia, and gut
microbiota. For pathogens, the acquisition of sterols from the host is critical as they colonize and construct their
cell envelopes. For gut microbes, interactions with cholesterol can alter the host lipid metabolism, thereby
contributing to cardiometabolic diseases and dyslipidemia. Despite the preponderance of research about
microbial interactions with these lipids, lacking are molecular insights into how the interactions occur and how
they are regulated. We will address this knowledge gap, which we posit will reveal novel targets for therapeutic
interventions in bacterial colonization and aberrant sterol lipid metabolism.
 Given that some bacteria produce sterols de novo, we reasoned that achieving an understanding of sterol
handling in bacteria that make them could reveal insights into their handling in bacteria that use them. We
therefore focused on Methylcoccus capsulatus, a bacterium reported to produce sterols nearly 40 years ago.
Recent studies reported a significant divergence in sterol biosynthesis in M. capsulatus. We have since added
to those reports one showing that sterol trafficking is also substantially different. We identified three proteins that
traffic sterols: BstA, BstB, and BstC. BstA is a member of the resistance nodulation division family of transporters
that work as transporters for a wide range of bacterial metabolites. BstB is a periplasmic binding protein with
homologs involved in phosphonate transport. Finally, BstC is an outer membrane associated lipoprotein
belonging to a family of transporters whose substrates are not known. The overall structures of the Bst proteins
are markedly different from eukaryotic sterol transporters. However, they all contain ligand sites that are similar
in the presentation of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues. We posit that a modified structural genomics
approach wherein the focus is on ligand sites instead of overall structure/sequence would enable the
identification of functionally homologous proteins in bacteria. This work will use bioinformatics, quantitative ligand
binding analyses, and structural approaches to identify and characterize sterol trafficking proteins in bacteria that
make sterols, pathogens that hijack sterols, and gut flora that modulate host sterol metabolism."
10911151,"Speech perception is modulated by experiences with native language phonotactic patterns. Sensory
processing of speech is fundamental to perception, language learning, and language comprehension however
much is unknown about how neural signals become language-specific within the cortical information stream.
Preliminary evidence suggests that language experience with phonotactic patterns modulates acoustic-level
sensory processing at early cortical stages (<150 ms) through feedback within the low frequency bands of the
electroencephalogram (EEG). However, there are conflicting reports on the timing of the modulatory effects,
and few, if any, cross-linguistic investigations of native and non-native phonotactic patterns that examine the
direction of information flow within cortical networks. For this project, we will analyze 96 EEG datasets,
previously obtained from 24 native Polish and 24 native English-speaking adults as they listened to same and
different spoken nonword pairs during two listening conditions, an Attend and Passive condition. Nonwords
within the pairs contained the onset sequences /pt/, /pət/, /st/, and /sət/ that occur in the Polish and English
languages, except for /pt/, which never occurs in English in the word onset position. Analysis of this dataset will
test the hypothesis that language-specific sensory processing occurs early within the cortical information
stream (<150 ms) through information flow directed to phonological processing regions in auditory cortex.
Multiple methods of analysis including AEPs, measures of time-frequency from brain source-level channels,
current source density, and measures of brain connectivity, including coherence and Granger causality-based
connectivity will be used to carry out the specific aims. Aim 1 will determine whether sensory processing of
spoken nonwords is language-specific within the context of selective attention at early cortical stages. Aim 2
will evaluate whether sensory processing of spoken nonwords is language-specific within the context of
repeated phonological sequences at early cortical stages. Aim 3 will determine the spatial distribution of
language-specific activity and the direction of information flow during sensory processing of native and non-
native phonotactic patterns and within the contexts of attention and repetition suppression. The outcomes will
clarify sensory processing mechanisms of speech perception."

The micturition reflex and normal sensation of bladder filling are mediated by non-nociceptive AG-fiber afferents
in the pelvic nerve. While pelvic C-fiber afferents do not normally respond to bladder distension, bladder
irritation/infection sensitizes these silent pelvic C-fibers to be responsive to bladder distension, causing urinary
urgency, frequency and inducing bladder pain. In addition to the pelvic nerve, the hypogastric nerve (HGN) also
innervates the bladder and hypogastric afferent fibers respond to bladder distention/irritation. Unfortunately, the
role of these afferents in the control of micturition was discounted because bilateral transection of HGNs has no
effect on normal physiological bladder voiding. Clinical observations have revealed, however, that HGN afferents
contribute to visceral pain and bladder pain in humans. We have recently discovered that the HGN also contains
“silent” fibers that are basally unresponsive to bladder distension under normal conditions but are sensitized to
respond to these pressures after chemical irritation of the bladder. This suggests that these fibers may play a
key role in pathological bladder disorders such as Overactive Bladder (OAB) or Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain
Syndrome (IC/BPS), both of which present clinically as urinary urgency, frequency, and, with IC/BPS, bladder
associated pain. At present, there is a gap in our understanding of the basic organization of the peripheral and
central neural pathways controlling the lower urinary tract, especially in relation to the HGN. Preliminary data
shows that electrical stimulation of HGN afferents can decrease bladder capacity in animals with chemically
irritated bladders (0.25% acetic acid) but not non-irritated bladders, suggesting HGN nociceptors interact, either
directly or indirectly, with the pelvic C-fiber pathways that drive bladder pathology. To further our understanding
of the nociceptive pathways regulating bladder pathology, we hypothesize that hypogastric nerve
nociceptors modulate bladder overactivity during bladder irritation through a convergence with pelvic
nerve nociceptive pathways in the spinal cord and/or the brain. To test this concept, we will anatomically
and functionally characterize the central projections of the nociceptive bladder afferent pathway in the HGN using
anesthetized cats, electrophysiological methods, c-fos tracing and fMRI imaging. Completion of the proposed
Research Plan will reveal the involvement of the HGN afferent pathway in the pathophysiological mechanisms
underlying bladder dysfunction and potential new diagnostic and treatment strategies."

As a trauma surgeon-scientist and early stage investigator in the 5th year of an NIGMS mentored career
development award for the translational study of post-injury platelet function, I have developed expertise,
infrastructure, and made significant contributions to demonstrating that early platelet dysfunction after injury is
common, driven by changing physiology, and associated with later development of organ failure. This is
important because injury remains a leading cause of death worldwide, but advances in initial care have shifted
the burden of injury-related morbidity and mortality from early after injury to later, leaving two important
challenges:1) identifying injured survivors at highest risk of developing initial and sustained organ failure
leading to long-term morbidity and late mortality, and 2) discovering novel targets for early therapies to prevent
development of organ failure after injury.
Platelets contribute to organ failure through pathobiology in thromboinflammation. In similar diseases, platelet
transcriptomics has improved mechanistic understandings and driven exploration of platelet-based
therapeutics. Platelet megakaryocyte derived ribonucleic acids (RNAs) are stable in health, but modified by
physiological signals in disease. Importantly, platelets are anucleate and lack RNA synthesis, thus providing
the cleanest transcriptomic view of RNA modification in human biology. As such, my proposal seeks to re-
imagine how we understand, measure, and intervene on early alterations in platelets after injury by focusing on
the platelet transcriptome to explore prediction and prevention of organ failure among patients who initially
survive their injuries, and to identify RNA modification targets that can be tested in model systems by
addressing these knowledge gaps: 1) Identify the early platelet transcriptional landscape of severe injury and
its relationship to development and resolution of organ failure in longitudinal patient studies; 2) Define the
effect of platelet RNA modifications on platelet function in samples from patients with severe injury and in ex
vivo modified healthy platelets; 3) Develop ex vivo and in vitro model systems to manipulate clinically relevant
platelet RNA modifications as ultimate conduits to in vivo models and clinical testing. I will use feasible (next
generation sequencing, ribosome footprint profiling), and novel (sub-population sequencing, ex vivo transgenic
platelet model systems) methods to identify novel molecular biomarkers and preventative targets of
development of organ failure after injury, and innovate our understanding of physiologically driven RNA
modification through the ideal anucleate biology of platelets under the optimal acute physiologic changes of
injury. This K to R award transition proposal is NIGMS mission-focused by using basic research to increase
understanding of biological processes and lay the foundation for advances in disease diagnosis, treatment,
and prevention within the area of ‘Injury’ (Pharmacological and Physiological Sciences Branch)."

Aspirin is currently recommended during pregnancy to help prevent preeclampsia, and also shows promise for
protecting against pregnancy loss. Preeclampsia is a dangerous complication of pregnancy that puts both the
pregnant person and their baby at risk of serious morbidity and death, and pregnancy loss is the most common
complication of pregnancy estimated to affect 20-30% of all conceptions. Current clinical guidelines from the
U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommend the use of daily “baby” aspirin (81 mg), begun at
12 weeks' gestation, to prevent preeclampsia. However, data suggest that even earlier initiation of aspirin and
at higher doses may result in greater protection. Furthermore, initiating aspirin immediately upon pregnancy
recognition may maximize effects on preeclampsia while also providing the added opportunity to prevent
pregnancy loss. Therefore, we propose to conduct a randomized trial to investigate whether daily “double low-
dose” aspirin therapy (162 mg per day) initiated at the time of first positive pregnancy test (up to 6 weeks'
gestation) may help prevent both outcomes. Clinical recruitment of participants through the follow-up of all
initial pregnancy tests throughout the Penn Medicine system will ensure feasibility for early detection of
pregnancy, enabling pregnancy loss monitoring and initiation of the trial intervention. The findings from this
study will provide essential, high-quality evidence in a diverse sample of U.S. pregnant people to inform
potential changes to clinical guidelines for aspirin use in pregnancy. We will (Aim 1) determine the effect of
aspirin treatment (dose 162 mg) initiated upon positive pregnancy test (up to 6 weeks' gestation) compared to
standard of care (dose 81 mg initiated at 12 weeks' gestation) on preeclampsia in a diverse population; (Aim 2)
determine the effect of aspirin treatment (dose 162 mg) initiated upon positive pregnancy test (up to 6 weeks'
gestation) compared to standard of care (dose 81 mg initiated at 12 weeks' gestation) on pregnancy loss in a
diverse population; and (Aim 3) identify phenotypes who may benefit most from “double low-dose” aspirin (162
mg) begun soon after conception, using machine learning, to inform more targeted therapy for optimal overall
pregnancy outcomes. As a safe, affordable intervention, these findings will have immediate translational value
to improve reproductive outcomes in pregnant patients, including minorities such as Black women vastly
underrepresented in current data."

Amyloid fibril formation is central to the disease etiology of a number of human diseases, including Alzheimer’s
disease, type 2 diabetes, and a variety of prion diseases. Although molecular structures for thousands of
amyloid fibrils have been resolved using techniques like X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR), the mechanism of amyloid fibril formation is largely unknown. The mechanism of primary nucleation,
whereby fibril formation begins in a solvent environment that previously did not contain any amyloid fibrils, a
crucial step in amyloid disease onset, is particularly mysterious. Dye-binding fluorescence microscopy
experiments have been used to observe the spontaneous formation fibril formation in microfluidic chambers
from individual primary nucleation sites. These experiments revealed two key mechanistic details: 1) fibril
formation propagated through solution as a traveling wave of constant velocity moving away from the primary
nucleation site, and 2) there exists a linear relationship between the lag time before fibril formation and the
inverse of volume. We hypothesize that the confinement of insulin to smaller volumes is an evolutionary
adaptation that renders amyloid fibril formation prohibitively slow, in turn, influencing the size of insulin
granules in pancreatic beta cells. We will develop novel top-down coarse-grained model that utilize a bridged
approach, whereby two representations of an ensemble of fibril-forming proteins (one purely topological
network representation and one granular representation in explicit space) exchange information as time
evolves. This approach will leverage the high computational efficiency of exponential-family random graph
models (purely topological), with improved spatial realism provided by a minimal explicit space model based on
a Lennard-Jones fluid. The models will first be fit using a threefold validation strategy whereby they will be
parameterized to simultaneously reproduce three known experimental observables: the fibril’s topological
structure (derived from structures reported in the protein data bank), fibril growth kinetics (compared to dye-
binding fluorescence experiments), and the spatial propagation patterns of fibril formation (compared to
aforementioned microfluidic experiments). Analysis of the validated models will then be used to propose
potential mechanisms for primary nucleation, the modulation of which is actively being explored for the
development of preventative treatments for amyloid diseases. The proposed work will require an innovation to
the network Hamiltonian methodology (first introduced by the PI and others), in that it will be the first to include
explicit spatial degrees of freedom. This development will facilitate the comparison of network Hamiltonian
models to experimental results and enhance the predictive power of the simulations, for both the present work
and future studies in molecular self-assembly."

The goal of the EDRN Southwest Clinical Validation Center for Head and Neck Cancer is to improve oropharyngeal cancer
screening through the rigorous validation of salivary biomarkers. The scientific approach of our Center is based on several
fundamental principles. First, that human papillomaviral (HPV) infection and persistence induces carcinogenesis in the
oropharynx over decades, generating well-documented circulating and salivary viral nucleic acid and serologic biomarkers.
These biomarkers have not yet been tested in rigorous, prospective studies with centralized CLIA/CAP biomarker validation.
Second, the low incidence requires that effective screening paradigms for oropharyngeal cancers (OPC) use novel systems
for large-scale prospective studies using self-collection sampling, digital enrollment, and distributive systems to enable
enrollment in underserved communities. Third, that the clinical management of positive biomarkers be rigorously addressed.
Our proposal builds on our extensive experiences with cancer biomarker development, verification, validation, innovative
clinical study management, and expertise in HPV oropharyngeal cancer screening. Our previous results on HPV serologic
biomarkers have been confirmed in blinded phase 2 multicenter validation studies. Our results have shown that multiplexed
panels of IgG antibodies for HPV16 are required for adequate predictive value. Our Meso Scale Diagnostics, LLC. (MSD®)
team has fielded over 3,000 instruments worldwide, and over 700 commercially available biomarker assay kits. Their
expertise at serologic assay development led to one of their V-PLEX® serology panels being selected by Operation Warp
Speed as the basis of its standard binding assays for immunogenicity assessments in all funded Phase III clinical trials of
COVID vaccines. We will use the MSD MULTI-ARRAY® platform to migrate the HPV serologic markers for target clinical
applications in saliva. This represents an ongoing collaboration with experts in large-scale self-collection salivary biomarker
screening at Arizona State University, experts on head and neck cancer screening at Baylor University Medical Center, and
AT Still University (ATSU) School of Dentistry and Oral Health. We will generate high-quality well-characterized samples to
validate circulating and salivary biomarkers to enhance oropharyngeal cancer screening. Adhering to the principles of
PRoBE design, we will perform Phase 2 validation of HPV serology and nucleic acid testing with cancer patient and control
sera and saliva, followed by developing and testing the methodology needed to conduct a prospective Phase 4 salivary
screening study. We will provide a resource for expertise and clinical repository for the rigorous validation of salivary and
circulating biomarkers for cancer screening."

 The rural Appalachian Kentucky region has the highest cancer incidence and mortality rates in the United
States, and it is also one of the most economically disadvantaged, medically underserved, and poorly educated

preparedness intervention strategies targeted to this population. Through a Continuing Umbrella of Research
Experiences (CURE) supplement in 2016, the research, clinical care, educational, and outreach strengths of the
University of Kentucky’s Markey Cancer Center were leveraged to create the Appalachian Career Training In
ONcology (ACTION) Program, which has been funded as a Youth Enjoy Science education intervention since
2018. In this renewal, each year the ACTION Program will immerse 20 underrepresented high school and 20
undergraduate students from Appalachian Kentucky in mentored cancer research, cancer care observation
experiences, cancer education and career development activities, as well as hands-on community outreach
activities. The goal of the program is to enhance the diversity of the biomedical workforce by preparing
underrepresented Appalachian Kentucky high school and undergraduate students for biomedical careers, while
also increasing the community’s understanding of cancer, thereby addressing the cancer and education
disparities in Appalachian Kentucky and beyond. Impacts of the program will include: 1) supporting students’
matriculation into post-secondary, professional, and/or graduate biomedical degree programs; 2) instilling in
students a lifelong commitment to research, education/outreach, and/or health care careers focused on the
cancer burden and unique challenges in Appalachian Kentucky and beyond; and 3) enhancing the Appalachian
Kentucky community’s understanding of cancer, cancer research, and clinical care, and linking these facets to
the benefits of science education. The overarching goal and the program impacts will be accomplished through
three Specific Aims: 1) to develop students’ cancer research knowledge and skills through cross-disciplinary
faculty- and peer-mentored research training experiences; 2) to enhance students’ career preparation by
providing cancer education and career development curriculum through faculty- and peer-led courses,
workshops, seminars, and career coaching and mentoring; and 3) to increase the understanding of the research
and clinical aspects of cancer and the importance of science education among students and teachers,
parents/caregivers and families of ACTION students, and general community members through impactful
outreach activities in students’ communities. New features of the program will include virtual research education
experiences that complement hands-on research and education activities, a multi-institutional virtual outreach
program, and a cancer curriculum outreach program for middle and high school students and teachers. With
significant momentum achieved since its creation, the ACTION Program will continue having a transformational
impact on Appalachian Kentucky students, their families, and their communities."
10900683,"Project Summary/Abstract: Project 2, Geometry of Neural Representations and Dynamics
In this project, we will measure and model the geometry of neural coding and dynamics during an
evidence-accumulation decision task. This work will advance the overall goal of this U19 program—elucidating
the circuit mechanisms that underlie working memory and decision-making and applying this information to
construct a multi-region, mechanistic circuit model. Neural population activity in the dorsal hippocampus of
mice is constrained to lie on a low-dimensional manifold during our task. Important behavioral variables like
position along the maze, and learned cognitive variables like evidence, are represented as gradients in
different directions along this latent space, giving rise to a geometric representation of knowledge. Observed
neural activity sequences correspond to trial-specific trajectories along the manifold.
 The first aim will characterize geometric representations in hippocampus and neocortex, to identify
general encoding principles of these representations and provide a richer dataset for comparison with our
mechanistic models. We will compare firing fields and manifold structure to predictions from several existing
statistical learning models to test the general idea that the manifolds capture task-specific statistical
regularities. We will also characterize geometric properties of neural coding and manifold structure across
these areas, starting with the prefrontal cortex, using simultaneous Neuropixels recordings from multiple
regions. We will identify what attributes, such as intrinsic dimensionality and variable encodings, are preserved
in the cortex compared to hippocampal representations.
 The second aim will evaluate the neural dynamics that govern state space flow along the manifold. So
far, we have focused on inferring the geometry of neural representations and have not directly examined
dynamics on the manifold. We developed a nonlinear method to simultaneously estimate manifold dimensions
and the dynamics on that manifold, based on neural spike data. We will extend this method for use with
calcium imaging data and then apply it to spiking and imaging data from other projects to infer manifold state
space flow. These data-driven inferences will be compared to the dynamics predicted by existing models.
 Finally, the third aim will causally probe manifold structure and the mechanisms of sequence generation
using optogenetic perturbation. With our new technology for simultaneous optogenetic perturbation and
imaging, we will measure changes in neural population activity during multi-neuron perturbations that will be
designed using sequence and manifold structure derived from population imaging data. Data, analyses, and
modeling from this project will provide key insights into the general properties of neural manifolds in a variety of
brain regions, along with the flow-field dynamics along manifolds that define neural trajectories on individual
trials. Taken together, these experiments and models will substantially advance three priority areas of the
BRAIN Initiative: the brain in action, demonstrating causality, and identifying fundamental principles."
10900685,"Summary/Abstract: Project 3, Internal Brain States
 Recent work from our collaboration has revealed that sensory decision-making in rodents relies on
time-varying internal states, with distinct decision-making strategies employed in different states. We have
developed a statistical model for identifying these states from decision-making behavior alone, and find that
mice switch among strategies on the timescale of tens to hundreds of task trials. This finding presents a major
challenge to traditional models of decision-making, which assume that trained animals rely on a single
evidence-accumulation strategy that is relatively fixed within a session. Furthermore, we found that inactivation
of the striatum affects the animal’s choices only in some states; in other states, decisions are not affected by
striatal inactivation, suggesting that mice rely on distinct neural circuits for making decisions in different states.
This project will follow up on this startling discovery in order to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying
internal states throughout the brain.
 Aim 1 will focus on characterizing the neural basis for the internal states governing sensory
decision-making and working memory. We will use causal perturbations and large-scale neural recordings to
characterize how population activity varies across states, and use closed-loop optogenetic inactivation
experiments to examine how different brain regions contribute to decision-making in different states.
 Aim 2 will look inside the brain to identify internal states from the dynamics of neural activity. We will
develop new models to characterize how internal states evolve on the timescale of single trials using spike
train data. We will then use these models to characterize state-dependent communication between brain
regions in large-scale multi-region electrophysiological recordings.
 Aim 3 will focus on determining how the cognitive decision-making states identified by our model relate
physiologically-defined internal states such as thirst, hunger, and arousal. This will allow us to connect our
findings about decision-making strategies to the extensive literature on physiological internal states. To assay
arousal, we will measure pupil diameter and use fiber photometry to measure activity of noradrenergic
neurons in the locus coeruleus and cholinergic neurons in basal forebrain. As a neural readout of hunger and
thirst, we will measure activity in relevant hypothalamic neuron populations. These measurements will be
compared to internal states derived from our models.
 We expect the experiments and modeling efforts in this project to substantially advance two priority
areas of the BRAIN Initiative: demonstrating causality and identifying fundamental principles."
10900688,"Project Summary/Abstract: Project 4, Multi-Region Interactions
 So far, our U19 program has largely focused on how individual brain regions support working memory
and decision-making. While this work has identiﬁed a large network of regions that contribute to
decision-making, we now need to understand how these regions interact with each other. What information is
sent between which regions, and when? How does such interaction depend on task demands? This project’s
goal is to address these gaps by combining cutting-edge recording methods, recordings during cell-type-
speciﬁc perturbations, new computational methods, and a panel of decision-making tasks.
 We propose to collect two datasets of multi-region, large-scale, cellular-resolution recordings (Aim 1).
In the ﬁrst, we will record simultaneously from a large network of regions, using next-generation Neuropixels
NXT technology. In the second, we will image simultaneously from three regions with our mesoscope while
obtaining cell-type-speciﬁc information through Core 4, Neuroanatomy. For both datasets, we will apply new
methods that we have developed to estimate time-dependent information ﬂow across regions.
 In addition to this broad, large-scale survey, we will perform two more targeted experiments. In the
basal ganglia, we will address the puzzle of how perturbation of neural activity that is not choice selective can
nevertheless lead to choice biases, by combining cell-type-specific perturbations with downstream recordings
(Aim 2). We will also address the broad and recently prominent question of the cerebellum’s role in cognition
(Van Overwalle 2020; Wagner 2020; Stoodley 2021). By manipulating cerebellar populations while recording in
thalamus and cortex, we will test the hypothesis that, by analogy to the cerebellum’s role in refining and
stabilizing motor trajectories, this region also serves to refine and stabilize neural trajectories in frontal
association areas (Aim 3).
 Taken together, we expect that these experimental and computational approaches will provide the
foundation for a multi-region description of how decisions are formed, which will provide important
constraints for our multi-region mechanistic model in Project 5. This work will substantially advance three
priority areas of the BRAIN Initiative: the brain in action, demonstrating causality, and identifying fundamental
principles."
10900690,"Project Summary/Abstract: Project 5, Mechanistic Multi-Region Brain Models
 Elucidating the specific computational roles of different brain areas and how they work together to solve
complex evidence-accumulation and decision-making problems is a key goal of our U19 program and of the
BRAIN initiative. This project will take advantage of the unique multi-region experimental datasets from
Projects 1-4 to construct a set of mechanistic models of how multiple brain regions work together to perform
our accumulation-of-evidence based decision-making task.
 Aim 1 focuses on the role of the basal ganglia, often associated with the gating or selection of actions,
within our cognitive decision-making task. Building on the experimental data in Project 4, Multi-Region
Interactions, we will construct models hypothesizing how the two core pathways traversing the basal ganglia,
the direct and indirect pathways, may serve to gate evidence or position information to accumulator circuits in
the neocortex. In turn, we will build models of how accumulated evidence from the neocortex is used to drive
the transition from evidence-seeking to choice-selective actions in the basal ganglia.
 Aim 2 focuses on the role of the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, and their interactions with sensory
and frontal regions of neocortex, in generating the joint cognitive map of animal position and accumulated
evidence observed in our neural recordings of Project 2, Geometry of Neural Dynamics and Representations.
The model will provide a powerful theory, grounded in biologically plausible mechanisms, for how cognitive
maps are formed and will form predictions for neuronal manifold structures and effects of causal manipulations
in our entorhinal, hippocampal, and neocortical recording experiments.
 Aim 3 focuses on the role of the cerebellum, and its interactions with neocortical
accumulation-of-evidence circuits, in decision-making. Drawing inspiration from classic motor cerebellar
experiments suggesting how the cerebellum may mediate the production of smooth, well-coordinated motor
actions, we propose a new theory of the cognitive cerebellum as stabilizing noisy neural trajectories to produce
smooth cognitive actions. This Aim will be informed by, and in turn form predictions for, the Cerebellar aim of
Project 4, Multi-Region Interactions.
 Aim 4 will combine the regional models of Aims 1 to 3 with a further model of multiple interacting
neocortical regions to produce a single, large scale model of accumulation-of-evidenced based
decision-making. The model will be informed by data from all projects and will enable us to dissect the roles of
individual regions and their interactions in the performance of the many variants of our decision-making task.
 Taken together, we expect that these modeling efforts, deeply integrated with experiments in the other
four Projects, will substantially advance three priority areas of the BRAIN Initiative: the brain in action,
demonstrating causality, and identifying fundamental principles."
10900693,"Project Summary/Abstract: Core 1, Administrative
The Administrative Core will facilitate team cohesion and provide support for all the research projects and
resource cores in this multi-component U19 program. In particular, the core’s administrator will support the
team director and the Internal Advisory Committee as they supervise budgets and scientific activities. The
first aim of this core will be to manage research teams to foster synergy across projects and laboratories.
That goal will not be very challenging because the investigators in this proposal have worked together as a
U19 team for four years and have a strong history of collaboration over the past eight years. Coordination of
the research projects and other resource cores is the highest priority of the Administrative Core, and the team
director takes it as part of his mission to make sure that all investigators and students of each project are well
informed of the activities in other projects and of relevant new findings in the field. An Annual Meeting will
include the project leaders, students, and postdocs, along with an External Advisory Board. This core’s
second aim is to organize the planning and evaluation of research projects, including fiscal oversight. By
supporting planning, coordination, and regulatory compliance, the Administrative Core will allow PIs,
postdocs, and students to focus on their research without spending excessive amounts of time puzzling out
paperwork. Overseeing the finances of a large collaboration involves a substantial management and
reporting effort, which the administrator will help to alleviate by producing monthly, quarterly, and annual
budget reports for the team director to review. Another task that involves significant administrative work is
personnel recruitment and management. The administrator will help to schedule interviews for job
candidates, meet reporting requirements, book travel, and acquire major supplies and equipment, as well as
strengthen ongoing outreach activities to ensure an even more diverse applicant pool. The third aim will be to
support outreach to other research groups and to the public, including disseminating the methods, tools, and
results of this research. The collaboration has its own website, which the administrator will update,
highlighting the team, projects, publications, and alumni. The administrator will also design and implement
outreach activities, such as public lectures and workshops, that translate how scientific findings on
decision-making and working memory relate to daily life. By managing these resources and activities, the
Administrative Core will help the team director to coordinate the five research projects and the four resource
cores, allowing project leaders and other research personnel to concentrate on their strengths in research.
This work will contribute substantially to enabling the U19 team to achieve its overall goal of determining the
neural basis of working memory and decision-making."
10900694,"Project Summary/Abstract: Core 2, Data Science
The Data Science Core will facilitate and standardize data collection and analysis for all research projects
within this U19 program. In particular, we will develop processes and systems for collecting, organizing, and
analyzing behavioral, imaging, electrophysiology, and neural manipulation data. To benefit the broader
neuroscience community, we will adopt shared data and metadata formats and make our pipelines publicly
available, with DataJoint as the common framework for scientific data pipelines and the Neurodata without
Borders format to share large raw data. This platform will facilitate collaborative analysis of datasets by multiple
researchers within the project, and make our analyses reproducible and extensible by others. We will make our
code and data public in easy-to-find, open-access repositories, such as the BRAIN Initiative’s Distributed
Archives for Neurophysiology Data Integration and Github. Our use of these common data standards will make
the data interoperable and reusable, thus ensuring that our data publications adhere to FAIR guidelines.
 The core’s first aim will be to provide standardized computational pipelines for neurophysiological and
behavioral data. We already have standardized data pipelines for collection of virtual-reality behavioral data
and preprocessing of mesoscope imaging and Neuropixels electrophysiology recordings. We now propose to
extend this effort to all data generated by the collaboration, via three new initiatives. First, we will construct a
shared platform, accessed by modular, user-friendly web apps, to support virtual-reality and
operant-conditioning tasks. Second, we will extend our preprocessing pipeline for electrophysiology and
calcium imaging data to support several state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms. Automation of
preprocessing, data transfer between systems, and standardization of manual curation steps will make
analyses faster and easier, enabling more effective and reproducible processing of neurophysiological data.
Third, we will develop infrastructure to support perturbations during behavior, including optogenetic,
pharmacological, and physical manipulations.
 The core’s second aim will be to document the system, train users, and disseminate our computational
tools and workflows. This effort will alleviate burdens on researchers, accelerate research by promoting
standard software tools, increase adoption of standardized pipelines, and facilitate reuse of our data by others.
To facilitate training and use of these pipelines, we will develop integrated web-based tools that allow
world-wide access and control of local data processing. The modular nature of these tools will make them
useful to and popular with the broader neuroscience community. We will provide continuous, in-person training
to all researchers and technicians, including yearly tutorials with external consultants. Together, these methods
for automating and standardizing data handling, when shared with the broader community, will improve the
reproducibility, reusability, and interoperability of data across the field of neuroscience."
10900697,"Project Summary/Abstract: Core 3, Behavior Automation
The main goal of this U19 project is to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying working memory and
decision-making. As a consequence, each research project in this application involves rodents trained on
cognitively demanding tasks that require the animals to accumulate evidence to make decisions. All these
animals are trained in the Behavior Automation Core’s central facility, which provides shared virtual-reality (VR)
and non-VR behavioral rigs, standardizing behavior across the research projects. The first aim of this core is to
provide this standardized behavioral training facility with cutting-edge efficiency and automation. As demand for
our services increases, we will continue to expand its capacity. We have developed a miniature VR rig that will
allow us to double the number of rigs in our space. As the training facility expands, the number of animals that
each technician handles will increase as well, requiring us to develop new automation tools to ensure the
health of the animals and the quality of the data. This core will develop and integrate new tools into the existing
high-throughput workflow to reduce human error and improve technician interventions. We will also improve
our systems to support and maintain experimental rigs; manage technician hiring, training, and scheduling to
meet demand; and oversee technicians’ workflow, animal management, and facility regulatory compliance.
 The core’s second aim is to design a modular behavioral rig that meets diverse experimental needs.
Rather than redesigning the rigs to accommodate new experiments, which would impose a substantial barrier
to innovation, we plan to develop a modular rig that will provide a shared framework for diverse experimental
needs. We will design and develop new modules, fitting them into the existing workflows or creating new
workflows to store and share the generated data across all the research projects and other resource cores.
 Finally, the third aim is to provide behavioral resources for the neuroscience community. To share our
methods with the broader scientific community, we are developing a website that contains comprehensive and
easy-to-navigate documentation. This website will provide resources such as a detailed explanation of how to
build experimental rigs, maintenance routines, a comprehensive description of facility workflow, how to set up
the behavioral database and integrate it with the rigs, and animal workflows. By providing this information, we
hope to facilitate wider standardization of these methods. This resource will enable researchers around the
world to introduce automated training for well-controlled, cognitively demanding tasks in their own laboratories.
In summary, our shared behavioral training facility will support the experimental components of all the research
projects within this U19 program. More generally, we expect that our pioneering methods for automating and
managing animal training, when shared with the broader community, will improve efficiency, rigor, and
reproducibility in behavioral research across the field of neuroscience."
10900699,"Project Summary/Abstract: Core 4, Neuroanatomy
The overall goal of this U19 collaboration is to elucidate how working memory and decision-making are
supported by interacting neurons and brain regions. To achieve this goal, our research projects will need
cutting-edge neuroanatomy tools, which the Neuroanatomy Core will provide. As it has done in the first U19
funding period, this core will continue to support protocols, software, and standards for light-sheet microscopy,
used with viral tracers to map long-range connectivity between brain regions. We will also add two
state-of-the-art imaging technologies: light-sheet microscopy of cleared whole mouse brains to enable
brainwide imaging of neural recording sites and immediate-early gene expression, and serial-section
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to provide rapid automated ultrastructural analysis.
 The first aim will be to support brainwide imaging of neural recording sites, activation patterns, and
connectivity. We will support the automated image processing and brain-registration pipeline that we developed
and extend it to new research aims. Our pipeline will identify recording sites registered to a standardized atlas,
and how brain regions are activated throughout learning. We will provide transcriptional profiling of our imaged
tissue for post-hoc identification of cell types in our imaging datasets.
 The second aim will be to optimize electron-microscopy sample preparation and serial sectioning.
Datasets from the TEM system will be processed by our petascale image-analysis pipeline to search for
sequential connectivity underlying sequential neural activity. In the long term, petascale connectomics may be
applied to other projects in the U19 to investigate circuit mechanisms of cognition in various brain areas. Our
TEM system has the highest raw throughput capacity of its kind in the world, but further work is needed to
realize its full potential. This core will optimize sample preparation and serial sectioning for TEM, and complete
software required to fully automate TEM imaging. We will optimize EM staining protocols for uniform, high
contrast in cubic millimeters of tissue, using our new X-ray-assisted technique. We will also optimize our
automated tape-collecting ultramicrotome system, to scale up serial sectioning from 4,000 ultrathin sections to
tens of thousands of sections. The third aim will be to automate high-throughput, parallel TEM imaging. When
complete, our high-throughput technology will enable imaging of cubic-millimeter datasets in a few weeks
instead of the current 6-12 months. New functionalities will extend the duty cycle from the current eight hours
with human monitoring to 24 hours automatically, enabling each TEM to produce over 20 TB of data in 24
hours. Software that can handle data throughput at this scale will be built to realize the full potential of our
imaging pipeline. More broadly, we expect that our pioneering methods for automating light-sheet and electron
microscopy, when shared with the broader community, will improve efficiency, rigor, and reproducibility in
anatomical research across the field of neuroscience and democratize access to petascale connectomics."
10911924,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are condensed extracellular matrix around a subset of neurons. PNNs can provide
physical protection and ion buffering for neurons and regulate their synaptic plasticity and intracellular signaling.
Recent evidence indicates that PNNs enmesh GABA neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARH)
to regulate energy and glucose homeostasis. However, little is known about the potential metabolic function of
PNNs in other brain regions that are also implicated in metabolic health.
 We observed abundant PNNs in the posterodorsal medial amygdala (MePD) and found that PNN-enmeshed
neurons in the MePD are mostly GABA neurons. Digestion of PNNs drastically reduces excitability and synaptic
activity of these GABAMePD neurons. Importantly, we showed that chronic disruption of MePD PNNs leads to
hyperphagia and modest weight/fat gain in chow-fed mice. On the other hand, chronic increases in MePD PNNs
result in lower body weight/fat in chow-fed mice. These results suggest that MePD PNNs and PNNs-enmeshed
GABAMePD neurons are required to prevent overeating and obesity. We will follow up these findings to establish
the function of MePD PNNs (Aim 1) and GABAMePD (Aim 2) neurons in energy and glucose homeostasis.
Meanwhile, we will delineate the mechanisms by which PNNs regulate excitability and synaptic activity of
GABAMePD neurons.
 17β-estradiol (E2) can act on estrogen receptor-α (ERα) to regulate energy and glucose balance in both
females and males. Previous reports showed that ERα in many brain regions mediates the metabolic effects of
E2 only in female mice, but not male mice. Our pilot observations indicate that E2 can increase PNNs in MePD
in both male and female mice. Importantly, loss of ERα in the medial amygdala (containing the MePD) causes
obesity not only in female mice, but also in male mice, suggesting the potential metabolic role of MePD in male
metabolic health. In Aim 3, we will follow up these findings to test whether E2 induces PNNs to facilitate GABA
neurons in the MePD to prevent obesity and metabolic dysregulation in both male and female mice.
 Together, we will reveal a new metabolic regulation mechanism: E2-ERα-PNNs-GABAMePD-energy/glucose
homeostasis. Our studies will advance our understanding about the estrogen biology in both female and male
metabolism and the metabolic role of PNNs in a new brain region MePD. Finally, we will identify a unique
anorexigenic GABA population, which is different from previous reported orexigenic GABA neural populations in
many other brain regions."
10918080,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Lysosomes play essential roles in cell physiology, not only controlling nutrient recycling and cellular growth, but
also mediating the proper handling of various cellular stress. Lysosomal dysfunction is associated with aging
and many diseases such as lysosomal storage disease, neurodegeneration, and cardiovascular diseases. A
hallmark of lysosomal-related diseases is lysosomal membrane permeabilization/damage (LMP) which if not
immediately resolved can cause detrimental problems including cell death. We now start to understand that LMP
triggers multiple cellular pathways to repair damaged lysosomes. However, none of the previously described
pathways appear to be essential for rapid lysosomal repair, suggesting additional repair mechanisms. As an
attempt to find such mechanism, we recently designed and executed an unbiased proteomic screen searching
for proteins specifically enriched on damaged lysosomes. This screen led to the discovery of the
phosphoinositide-initiated membrane tethering and lipid transport (PITT) pathway as an essential mechanism
for rapid lysosomal repair. We found that LMP stimulates robust production of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate
(PtdIns4P, PI4P) on damaged lysosomes by type II alpha phosphatidylinositol-4 kinase (PI4K2A). Lysosomal
PI4P drives the formation of extensive membrane contacts between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and
damaged lysosomes by recruiting multiple oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP)-related protein (ORP) family
members. The ORPs catalyze subsequent ER-to-lysosomal transport of cholesterol and phosphatidylserine
(PS) to mediate rapid membrane repair. While cholesterol by itself increases membrane stability, PS activates
ATG2-mediated lipid transport for direct lysosomal repair. The PITT pathway is activated in response to diverse
disease-related lysosomal-damaging conditions and is expected to have enormous impact on human
pathophysiology. Remarkably, the PITT pathway not only reveals lipid transfer at membrane contacts as a
essential mechanism for lysosomal repair, but it also establishes lipid remodeling as a new platform to
understand lysosomal quality control. Through three independent projects in the next five years, our lab will
continue studying LMP-triggered lysosomal lipid remodeling for better mechanistic understanding of lysosomal
quality control and potential therapeutic applications. First, we are purifying lysosomes during and after
lysosomal repair to characterize lipid changes by lipidomics, which we believe will identify new lipid messengers
important for lysosomal quality control. Second, the PITT-mediated lysosomal cholesterol accumulation provides
a great cellular model to study cholesterol transport, and we are particularly interested in the mechanism for
cholesterol egress from newly repaired lysosomes. Finally, we are also performing chemical screens using FDA-
approved chemical library to search for small molecules that activate or block the PITT pathway. The identified
small molecules have well established protein targets, which will help define the regulatory networks for the PITT
lysosomal quality control pathway as well as delineate new strategies to improve lysosomal quality."
10818381,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Olfactory hallucinations occur in many disorders, including Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, schizophrenia, and
migraines, but the neural mechanisms underlying these hallucinations are unknown. Mice have a powerful
olfactory system that is well-studied at the molecular, systems, and behavioral levels. Importantly,
hallucinogens such as LSD, psilocybin, and DOI primarily act on serotonin pathways, which feed heavily into
the mouse olfactory system. The proposed research will determine the behavioral changes in olfactory-driven
behaviors and identify the impact on neural activity in the olfactory bulb.
Mechanistic studies of hallucination in animal models are fundamentally limited, since other animals do not
verbalize what they perceive. However, in lieu of a verbal report, internal states can be inferred from an
animal’s externally observable behavior. Using machine-learning tools, our lab has shown that a mouse’s
behavioral states can be inferred from close analysis of sniffing and movement. In this project, we will
investigate the mouse hallucinogen response using high resolution behavioral analysis and neuronal ensemble
recordings in the olfactory bulb. We hypothesize that hallucinogens will impact olfactory perceptual
reports and strategic sniffing behavior. Further, we hypothesize that the neural activity in the olfactory
bulb will resemble odor-evoked activity in the absence of odor after hallucinogen administration.
To address our hypothesis about perceptual reports, in aim 1 we will train freely-moving mice on a two-
alternative choice task to locate the source of an odor while recording movement and sniffing. After the mice
are trained, we will administer DOI or saline. Our hypothesis predicts that DOI will induce false alarms,
decrease accuracy, and decrease confidence in the presence of an odor stimulus. To address our hypothesis
about neural activity, in aim 2 we will record movement, sniffing, and neural activity in the olfactory bulb during
spontaneous, uninstructed, freely-moving behavior. We will test the prediction that hallucinogen administration
alters the neural dynamics of the olfactory bulb to resemble odor-evoked activity in the absence of an odor
stimulus. Completion of this proposal will provide insight into the behavior and neural circuitry of olfaction and
help inform treatment and policy on the use of hallucinogens to treat various disorders."
10907526,"SUMMARY
Industrial hygienists are tasked with protecting worker health. However, there are many hazardous substances
which lack official guidelines related to their safe management. Thus, there is a need for professionals charged
with protecting worker health to be able to increase their knowledge regarding these emerging contaminants,
emerging technologies, and systems to protect worker health. This project was designed to address this need.
The Distance Education and Training on Emerging Contaminants and Technologies (DETECT) project will
implement online training modules and in-person research experiences to provide unique educational
opportunities for education on emerging contaminants and technologies for prospective graduate students,
graduate students, and industrial hygienists. The DETECT program will establish a consortium between
established programs in industrial hygiene at Purdue University, the University of Toledo, the Air Force Institute
of Technology, and the University of South Florida. The DETECT program will focus on identifying and
characterizing emerging contaminants, use of emerging technologies to assess and monitor hazardous
chemicals, and safety management systems or strategies to mitigate and prevent potential hazards. Emerging
contaminants to be discussed include, but are not limited to nanoparticles, bioaerosols, hazardous algal blooms,
and ototoxic compounds. There will be three main educational components of the DETECT program: online
educational modules, summer research sessions, and online laboratories. First, we will create a series of for-
credit and non-credit online lessons; these will be grouped together in three modules. The for-credit version of
this online educational content will be incorporated into existing industrial hygiene graduate programs at the
DETECT consortium institutions. The non-credit version will be available free of charge for anyone to access via
the Purdue Online website. Second, we will develop and run four in-person summer research sessions. Each
year, these will be hosted by a different DETECT consortium intuition and will feature a different topic.
Prospective graduate students and graduate students from the DETECT consortium institutions and beyond will
be encouraged to participate. These intensive sessions will include research training, laboratory tours, and the
opportunity for participants to complete, analyze, and present a short research project. Third, we will develop
five online laboratories and at least one virtual reality laboratory. The online laboratories will be accessible using
an internet browser, and will be incorporated into the online educational modules. The virtual reality laboratory
will be completed in-person by graduate students at the DETECT consortium institutions. Upon completion of
this project, we will have developed and implemented training in key emerging contaminants and technologies
to assess, mitigate, and prevent their impact via platforms that are accessible to a large, diverse population. This
will have a significant impact on industrial hygienists and other professionals’ ability to protect workers and the
public from health effects resulting from exposure to hazardous substances."
10916191,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Social determinants of health (SDoH) are associated with poor health outcomes and health disparities. The
National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine’s Future of Nursing Report encourages clinicians
to address SDoH, which are the environmental conditions in which people live, learn, work, play, and worship,
that can affect health, functioning, and quality-of-life. While there is a large corpus of knowledge associating
SDoH with childhood asthma, a gap exists on screening of SDoH in school-based health centers (SBHCs).
SBHCs care for children pre-kindergarten to 18 years of age, working collaboratively with the school nurse to
advance the health and well-being of all youth. Although SBHCs have access to individual-level health
information about the child, SBHC providers do not have easy access to SDoH information at the
neighborhood and community level. Screening pediatric families for SDoH in a systematic way can facilitate
connection to pertinent resources. However, there is a dearth of information regarding SDoH screening and the
role of SBHCs in pediatric SDoH interventions. This project focuses on the critical need to identify the
facilitators and barriers of SDoH information gathering behaviors in SBHCs. Through an exploratory sequential
design, the project will include the development of an informatics resource providing SDoH information to
SBHC providers. Asthma will serve as the first clinical condition for this novel work. The investigators will
address three specific aims: Aim 1. Describe the information gathering behaviors for SDoH and asthma
performed by school-based health providers (i.e., nurse practitioners, physicians, physician assistants) for
preventative asthma care, and what barriers exist for information gathering. Aim 2. Develop and evaluate an
informatics resource that provides actionable SDoH information related to the preventative management of
asthma. Aim 3: Evaluate the feasibility of an informatics resource comprising SDoH among school-based
health providers for use in the preventative management of asthma. The PI will receive research training
through the rich scientific environment of Vanderbilt University. Training goals will focus on acquiring
knowledge and skills in biomedical informatics, research methodology, qualitative focus groups, SDoH, and
responsible conduct of research. The highly experienced mentorship team will provide support to make
continued progress toward independence in a program of research focused on SDoH in school-based health
centers, of which this project is a key component. Upon successful completion of the proposed study,
contributions are expected to fill a critical knowledge gap with evidence that supports screening for SDoH by
school-based health providers. These contributions will be significant because they are expected to provide a
way to operationalize SDoH, to prevent asthma exacerbations, and address social needs to improve the lives
of school-age children. The proposed study supports the mission of NINR through inquiry that addresses both
the SDoH and Health Equity research lenses in the unique setting of school-based health centers."
10937068,"Project Summary: Two fundamental goals in genetic epidemiology are the identification of genetic variants
that cause disease (fine-mapping) and the development of polygenic risk scores (PRS) that predict individual-
level disease risk using genetic information. As genetic datasets expand, these goals become increasingly
realistic. However, most genetic datasets overrepresent European populations, limiting the generalizability of
scientific findings, the discovery of causal variants, and the accuracy of PRS in non-European populations. If
unaddressed, differences in PRS accuracy will widen ancestry-based health disparities. Most methods in
genetic epidemiology consider one ancestry and disease at a time. This research proposes methods for causal
variant identification and genetic risk prediction that share information across ancestries and diseases.
 The first aim is to develop a method for fine-mapping using data from multiple ancestry groups. Causal
variant identification provides insight into disease etiology and helps researchers identify drug targets. The sum
of single effects (SuSiE) model is a powerful approach for fine-mapping in a single population. Incorporating
data from multiple populations can greatly improve fine-mapping due to ancestry-based differences in patterns
of correlation between variants and the presence of variants with causal effects in some, but not all ancestries.
In this aim, MultiSuSiE, a multi-population fine-mapping method motivated by SuSiE will be developed and
applied. SuSiE provides substantial benefits in terms of speed, power, and interpretability compared to other
fine-mapping methods. MultiSuSiE will bring the state-of-the-art in fine-mapping to the multi-ancestry context.
 The second aim is to develop and apply ssCTPR, a summary statistic based PRS method that
leverages shared information across diseases. PRS show great promise for informing medical treatment
decisions and disease screening interventions. A recent method, cross-trait penalized regression (CTPR),
boosts prediction accuracy by leveraging shared genetic bases across diseases but requires difficult-to-obtain
individual-level data. In this aim, ssCTPR, a multi-trait summary statistic-based method motivated by CTPR will
be developed and applied. ssCTPR is innovative in its statistical approach: ssCTPR will jointly model variants
and diseases, use penalized regression, and share information across traits using a Laplacian quadratic
penalty that is effective in the multi-disease setting, but has not been investigated using summary statistics.
 The third aim is to develop a method that uses the methodological advances of aims 1 and 2 to improve
PRS prediction in non-European populations. PRS prediction accuracy in non-European populations is much
lower than in European populations. As PRS enter the clinic, populations with inequitable health outcomes will
fail to benefit from the latest in precision medicine innovation. In this aim, MultiPolyPred, a method that models
individual risk using multi-ancestry fine-mapping and a multi-disease PRS will be developed and applied. Our
method will be the only non-European PRS method to leverage multi-ancestry fine-mapping."
10925191,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a sleep-related breathing disorder associated with major co-morbidities and is
estimated to affect nearly one billion people worldwide. Moreover, there are differences in prevalence, diagnosis
rates, and co-morbid outcomes for OSA based on the demographics of a patient, such as age, race, and gender.
The diversity of the clinical manifestations, objective measurements, and outcomes – the phenotype – of OSA
underscores the opportunity for predictive models to improve care of patients with OSA. Predicting future (i.e. 5-
year post-diagnosis) risks of OSA co-morbid outcomes and predicting how different treatments for OSA affect
these risks can help clinicians and patients choose the best treatment strategies.
Current OSA outcomes research has key limitations. Prior studies have characterized groups of OSA patients
that exhibit similar characteristics, referred to as sub-phenotypes of OSA. However, these studies have been
limited by analyzing relatively few variables obtainable from questionnaires. To address this limitation, we will
use rich longitudinal electronic medical records (EMR) data to characterize OSA sub-phenotypes and to predict
OSA outcome risks for individual patients. To extract insights from EMR data, we will leverage modern
computational methods based in machine learning (ML). A second major limitation of existing OSA research is
worse predictive model performance for some groups. Model biases have real-world negative implications. The
ubiquitous STOP-BANG questionnaire used to screen patients for further OSA testing performs worse for women
and Asian individuals, leading to potential delayed, under-, or misdiagnosis of OSA in these groups. To address
this limitation, this proposed project will assess and mitigate biases present in our predictive models.
To better understand patient factors associated with OSA outcomes, this project has two aims. In Aim 1
clustering methods will be applied to identify groups of OSA patients who share similar sub-phenotypes
according to combinations of clinical features and objective measurements present in EMR data. Then, sub-
phenotypes will be compared by the rates at which they exhibit different OSA outcomes, providing intuition into
potential underlying pathophysiologic differences. In Aim 2, ML classifiers will be applied to build and validate
algorithmically fair predictive models for future OSA outcome risks as well as effects of OSA treatments. Patient-
specific factors that are consistently associated with differences in OSA outcome risks through Aims 1 and 2 will
provide both personalized insights into treatment options and stronger evidence of underlying pathophysiology
worthy of further investigation."
10817789,"PROJECT SUMMARY
It was long taken for granted that obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) is the primary driver of angina and
major adverse cardiac events. However, recent landmark studies have shown that up to 50% of the patients
referred for diagnostic testing have ischemia with no obstructive CAD (INOCA). A large proportion of INOCA
patients have coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD), which even in the absence of flow-limiting stenoses
can lead to myocardial ischemia and carries a high risk of adverse events. The reference standard for
assessment of CMD is the functional coronary reactivity (CR) test, which is invasive. Despite key studies showing
value of stratifying therapy based on CR testing, the practical utility of CR testing in the INOCA population is
limited by its invasive nature, which carries serious risks even at experienced centers. Hence, a noninvasive
approach that can detect and stage the severity of CMD would be invaluable for managing INOCA patients.
Driven by this unmet need, prior studies have employed imaging approaches to index myocardial perfusion
reserve (MPR) against CR; however, the association shown to date between MPR and CR impairment has been
weak, likely due to the suboptimal sensitivity of MPR to subendocardial myocardial blood flow (MBF) deficits
which is a hallmark of CMD. Studies using invasive microsphere-based methods have established a stress
subendocardial-to-subepicardial (endo-epi) MBF gradient of larger than 1.0 in healthy animals, and shown that
it decreases well below 1 under abnormally elevated microvascular resistance. However, noninvasive detection
of endo-epi MBF gradients using existing imaging strategies is challenging because of the need to resolve MBF
transmurally. We have developed new MRI strategies aimed at overcoming key barriers for accurate evaluation
of endo-epi MBF gradients and applied them in preliminary animal and patient studies. Based on our preliminary
data, we hypothesize that in the setting of CMD, impaired microvascular CR manifests as a stress-induced endo-
epi MBF gradient, and the magnitude of this gradient significantly correlates with CMD severity. To test this
hypothesis, we propose 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a free-breathing artifact-free MRI technique
optimized for high-resolution imaging of endo-epi MBF gradients, combined with a machine learning approach
for fully-automated objective quantification of MBF gradients. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that CMD
severity can be staged on the basis of MRI-derived stress MBF gradient in a pig model of CMD. In Aim 3, we will
test the hypothesis that CMD severity in INOCA patients is highly correlated with MRI-derived stress MBF
gradient. This project brings together multiple interdisciplinary investigators with a strong collective track record
in developing cardiac imaging strategies to advance a noninvasive approach for determining CMD severity based
on the MRI-derived stress MBF gradient. Hence the proposal is a major step towards improving the management
of INOCA patients and towards imaging-guided evaluation of novel therapies aimed at CMD."
10897906,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading infectious killer worldwide. Upon exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis
(Mtb), most people develop asymptomatic latent TB infection (LTBI phenotype). However, Dr. Anterasian's
collaborators identified about 7% of individuals who, despite household exposure to pulmonary TB, do not
convert their tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-γ release assay (IGRA), and thus can be classified as
clinically resistant to traditionally defined LTBI (“RSTR” phenotype). Uncovering mechanisms of natural
resistance to Mtb infection may provide unique insights that can inform the development of host-directed
therapeutics (HDTs). Dr. Anterasian has analyzed the first global proteomic dataset of Mtb-infected primary
human macrophages and discovered 46 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) that define the RSTR vs LTBI
macrophage proteomic response to Mtb. By integrating her data with those of her collaborators, Dr. Anterasian
has identified DAPs that may undergo Mtb-induced post-translational modifications (PTMs) and/or interact with
Mtb bacterial proteins. She has also used bioinformatic network analyses as well as genetic and transcriptomic
data from the same patient cohort to ultimately curate a list of 19 proteins for further mechanistic studies. In
particular, the Rab family of GTPases interact with Mtb bacterial proteins, undergo Mtb-induced ubiquitination,
and are key regulators of membrane trafficking and autophagy, which are pathways Mtb exploits during
infection. The objective of this proposal is to define macrophage pathways and proteins that characterize the
protective RSTR response. Dr. Anterasian hypothesizes that RSTR individuals promote macrophage Mtb
clearance through DAP-mediated pathways modulated by DAP-Mtb protein interactions and differential DAP
ubiquitination. In Aim 1, Dr. Anterasian will investigate Rab-dependent mechanisms of protection against Mtb
in macrophages and how Mtb proteins subvert Rab function. In Aim 2, Dr. Anterasian will identify candidate
proteins associated with control of Mtb infection, their PTMs, and ubiquitin-dependent mechanisms of
resistance. By combining proteomic, bioinformatic, and cellular immunology approaches, Dr. Anterasian is well
poised to identify key pathways in human macrophage resistance to Mtb that can be targeted with HDTs.
Dr. Anterasian is a Pediatric Infectious Disease Fellow in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Seattle
Children's Hospital and the University of Washington. She additionally proposes a comprehensive career
development program that includes: 1) mentored training in proteomics and cellular immunology; 2) formal
didactics in large data set analyses (i.e. proteomics, statistical genetics, systems biology); 3) mentorship in the
design of proteomic studies, human subjects research, and scientific writing; 4) structured opportunities to
present her work to local and international scientific audiences; and 5) Scientific Advisory Committee meetings
that ensure scientific and career development progress. By the conclusion of this award, Dr. Anterasian will
transition to an independently-funded expert in the Mtb host response who will direct her own laboratory."

A common and currently intractable feature of heart failure is the stiffening of cardiac tissue that impairs the
heart's ability to relax. The microtubule cytoskeleton contributes to the internal stiffness of heart muscle cells,
and under certain conditions can impede the ability of cardiomyocytes to both contract and relax. Over the first
five years of this R01, we found that cardiomyocyte stiffness is tightly regulated by post-translational
detyrosination of microtubules, and that detyrosinated microtubules are consistently elevated in human heart
failure, concomitant with increased myocardial stiffness. We also found that reducing detyrosinated
microtubules is sufficient to lower stiffness and improve contraction and relaxation in cardiomyocytes and
myocardial tissue from patients with diverse forms of heart failure. We further identified the enzyme
responsible for detyrosination in the heart, and showed that targeting this enzyme is sufficient to robustly
improve relaxation in failing human heart cells. As such, detyrosination forms a promising new therapeutic
target for the treatment of heart failure. The proposed research will test the hypothesis that genetic or small
molecule targeting of the “tyrosination cycle” can stably improve both systolic and diastolic function in different
small and large animal models of heart failure. Studies under three aims will address several components of
this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will explore whether a gene therapy approach overexpressing the tyrosinating
enzyme (TTL) is sufficient to improve systolic function in a genetic mouse model of heart failure, and to
improve diastolic function in surgical model of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Aim 2 experiments
will focus on a different therapeutic modality consisting of novel and highly potent small molecule inhibitors of
the detyrosinating enzyme (VASH). We will evaluate the pharmacokinetics of these novel inhibitors and test
their tolerability and efficacy for reducing detyrosination and improving cardiac function in both rodent and
human cells and tissues. In Aim 3, we will move our exploration to larger animal studies and test whether
targeting detyrosination is sufficient to improve myocyte and myocardial function in cats with hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy and with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Our cross-species, multi-scale and
multi-pronged approach will balance our goals of reductionist rigor and integrative relevance that ultimately
furthers clinical translation. Together, this work will determine if targeting detyrosinated microtubules can stably
improve cardiac function in heart failure, and identify therapeutic compounds that may be suitable for
progression into a clinical pipeline."

Brain tumors are the leading cause of cancer related death in children; among these, diffuse intrinsic pontine
glioma (DIPG) and other histone-3 K27M (H3K27M) mutated diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) are the most
aggressive and are universally fatal with current standard therapies. Despite several decades of investigational
trials testing dozens of therapeutic approaches, median overall survival for DIPG is 11 months. Chimeric antigen
receptor (CAR)-expressing T-cells have mediated impressive clinical activity in B-cell malignancies, and recent
preclinical and early clinical results suggest benefit in CNS malignancies. We discovered homogenous, high
overexpression of the GD2 ganglioside on H3K27M DMGs and demonstrated impressive antitumor effects in
xenograft models of H3K27M-mutant DIPG following treatment with GD2-CAR T cells (GD2-CART, Mount, Nat
Med 2018). Significant clinical experience with GD2 targeting CAR T cells, available mostly from studies in
neuroblastoma, demonstrate safety and some early signals of antitumor activity. Safe and effective translation
of these findings to children with DMGs would transform the landscape for this universally lethal pediatric brain
tumor. This bench-to-bedside-to-bench project will conduct three aims in parallel leveraging a recently launched
single institution Phase I trial of GD2.BB.z.iCasp9-CAR T cells administered intravenously following a
lymphodepleting preparative regimen in children and young adults with H3K27M DMGs. The first aim focuses
on safety, integrating insights gleaned in our preclinical models into trial design to diminish the risk of tumor
inflammation associated neurotoxicity (TIAN), to establish best practices and to develop improved grading and
treatment algorithms for this novel toxicity. The second aim focuses on efficacy, assessing clinical activity of
GD2-CART in DMG and identifying biomarkers and clinical features associated with response. We further
address the limitations of standard radiographic imaging in these infiltrative tumors using a novel machine
learning aided MRI radiomics approach to quantify textural changes within the tumor and assess whether such
changes correlate with clinical outcome, and we assess whether GD2-CART induced changes in CSF cell free
DNA can provide a rapid quantitative assessment of antitumor response. Our third aim is a discovery aim,
focused on improving understanding of the biology associated with myeloid cell activation following GD2-CART
therapy for DMGs, which we observe in preclinical models and we observed in the first patient treated. Here we
undertake comprehensive single cell profiling of CSF myeloid cells emerging post-GD2-CART in patients
enrolled on the study and in preclinical models, and bedside-to-bench translation using murine models to test
the hypotheses that GD2-CART induced CNS myeloid cell expansion/activation limit the efficacy of GD2-CART,
are modulated by corticosteroid therapy and that this obstacle can be overcome by engineering CD47
overexpression in the GD2-CART."

Prostate cancer is the most common non-skin malignancy in men and is projected to cause 34,500 deaths in
2022 in the United States alone. Sequencing studies of advanced lethal castrate resistant prostate cancer
(CRPC) have identified a high incidence (~13%) of pathogenic BRCA2 mutations. These findings have enabled
clinical trials and subsequent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase
(PARP) inhibitors (PARPis) olaparib and rucaparib in advanced CRPC patients harboring a pathogenic BRCA2
mutations. Despite initial responses, therapy resistance to PARPis is common. However, the molecular
adaptations that occur in BRCA2 mutant CRPC in response to PARPi are poorly understood, due to a lack of
biologically and clinically relevant models. Our proposed studies leveraging two new patient-derived model
systems of pathogenic BRCA2 mutant CRPC will elucidate the biological mechanisms implicated in PARPi
therapy response and help address a critical clinical unmet need to prevent or overcome resistance to PARPis.
In this proposal, we will use two new models of pathogenic BRCA2 mutations in CRPC, including the 40511
cell line and matched PARPi-sensitive and resistant LTL-610 PDXs. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and
Over-Representation Analysis (ORA) of RNA-sequencing data utilizing these novel models point to significant
upregulation in genes involved in Extracellular Matrix (ECM) modulation in response to both short and long term
PARPi therapy. In particular, the ECM associated gene SERPINE1, which encodes for the protein Plasminogen
Activator Inhibitor 1, (PAI-1) is the most significantly implicated gene after 72 hours of olaparib treatment via
GSEA leading edge analysis. Since PAI-1 canonically prevents ECM degradation, we then used Masson’s
Trichrome staining to evaluate the PARPi resistant LTL-610 PDX and found dramatically increased Type I
Collagen deposition compared to its PARPi sensitive parental line. Since stromal alterations are known to affect
cancer cell survival, we hypothesize that the induction of ECM genes like SERPINE1 by PARPis in BRCA2
mutant CRPC results in enhanced tumor stroma, and enables therapy resistance. Two specific aims are
proposed in this grant to study this hypothesis: in Aim 1, we will elucidate the role of SERPINE1 signaling in
ECM deposition in BRCA2 mutant CRPC in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo. In Aim 2, we will investigate the mechanism
of transcriptional activation of SERPINE1 in BRCA2 mutant CRPC in response to PARPi. The results from these
studies will enable systematic approaches to modulate ECM alterations in response to PARPi in BRCA2 mutant
CRPCs."
10928724,"Abstract
Opioid medications have been widely prescribed in efforts to control medical and surgical pain, but opioid use
disorder (OUD) has become a serious, prevalent, and costly public health problem. Identifying risk factors for
the development of OUD after prescribed opioid use could help reduce serious injury and mortality-related
outcomes, like overdose. Hippocampal (Hpc)-circuit based context processing is an important neuro-cognitive
process associated with OUD. Evidence for context processing deficits is seen in psychiatric, substance use,
and chronic pain populations. One major predictor of adult OUD that is also linked to context processing is
adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). ACEs predict high OUD rates and are associated with complex co-
morbidity (e.g., chronic pain, psychiatric conditions, other substance use disorders) that complicates treatment
for OUD. ACEs also compromise Hpc function through detrimental effects of stress hormones on Hpc neurons.
Thus, ACEs may lead to Hpc circuitry dysfunction and context processing deficits, providing a shared pathway
to chronic pain, prescribed opioid use, and OUD development. This Katz R01 will utilize the PI’s expertise in
neurocognitive mechanisms of trauma to provide the first direct examination of a mechanistic pathway of risk
for OUD that involves links between ACEs and context processing deficits. We will examine 75 adults with
OUD taking the prescription opioid agonist buprenorphine (BUP) and compare them to two control groups: 75
adults without OUD taking BUP and 75 adults without OUD and not taking BUP, in a cross-sectional study. We
will use a well-validated context processing paradigm to interrogate Hpc structure and function and behavioral
performance. Validated self-report and objective measures of opioid misuse, OUD, and ACEs will be used to
examine links between ACEs, context processing, and OUD. Our specific aims include: 1) identifying Hpc-
circuit based context processing deficits in OUD, independent of opioid agonist effects; 2) establishing
links between ACEs, context processing, and OUD severity; and 3) exploring how common symptom
domains are associated with ACEs, context processing, and OUD. The findings from this project will lead
to longitudinal work with the potential to trace a mechanistic pathway that helps explain co-morbidities between
chronic pain, stress-related disorders, and OUD development after prescribed opioid use. This may ultimately
open new doors to discovery of prevention and treatment paradigms that will identify those at risk when opioids
are prescribed (high ACEs, poor context processing), and ultimately shape neuroscience-informed ways to
remediate functional deficits even after they have developed."
10888234,"Only 19% of employed scientists and engineers are from racial and ethnic minorities, and even fewer (~8%) in
the field of communication sciences and disorders (CSD). Creating a more diverse biomedical research work-
force necessitates recruiting talented students from diverse populations early in their educational journey. The
overall goal of the proposed training program is to increase the ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic diversity of
individuals who will ultimately pursue careers in biomedical, clinical, and health-services research in the area of
CSD, and in the professorate who will train the next generation of clinicians and scientists. The objective of this
application is to start a program that will recruit a more diverse research workforce at the University of Maryland-
College Park (UMD). We will implement a year-long training program that provides under-represented under-
graduates at the transition point of identifying their career path with an enriched, long-term experience to conduct
research in our labs. This objective is supported by the highly diverse undergraduate population at UMD, and
the university’s strong commitment to increase diversity through numerous campus initiatives. The proposed
program will enable the department to address barriers experienced by under-represented minorities (time, re-
sources, and awareness), and dramatically increase the diversity of students participating in our exceptional
research programs that span the range of research foci in CSD. We will achieve the objective of this application
with the following three specific aims: (1) Increase undergraduate research participation in Hearing and Speech
Sciences (and related departments) to reflect the diversity of the UMD student body, (2) Increase trainees’ future
academic success and likelihood of pursuing research careers by providing mentorship and professional devel-
opment opportunities, improving the diversity of the pipe-line for CSD researchers, and (3) Disseminate the
programmatic R25 results so that other institutions can follow our model. The successful completion of our spe-
cific aims will ultimately increase the diversity of our field, locally and nationally, allowing us to develop a broader
understanding of communication impairments across diverse populations, and to be better prepared to provide
evidence-based clinical services to these populations. Our program will be innovative because it: (1) weaves
together multiple components of research training that remove barriers and allow for student success (hands-on
laboratory research experiences, professional development training, and individualized mentoring), (2) includes
multiple types of mentors (one or more research mentors, peer and near-peer mentors within the lab, and career
ambassadors, collaboration with the BIPOC-CSD network), (3) targets undergraduate students at a point of
transition in their academic career, (4) focuses specifically on the field of CSD, and (5) provides research oppor-
tunities in a highly active, productive, and funded department with an excellent record of producing PhDs who
successfully obtain jobs in research."
10885951,"Overconsumption of sugar is associated with obesity and related chronic disease, which in turn cost ~300,000
lives and ~$546 billion annually in the United States alone. Leading health agencies recommend reducing
intake of added sugars, but pleasure from sweetness may hinder the effort to achieve this goal. A person’s
preference for sweetness is determined by both genetic and environmental factors, and therefore,
understanding these factors is a key step towards devising personalized strategies to reduce sugar
consumption. While several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified to be associated
with sweet preference within individuals of European ancestry, whether result can be generalizable to other
populations warrants further investigation. Furthermore, individuals from the same ancestry group but exposed
to different environmental factors may also differ in sweet preferences. The first aim of this study (n = 428) will
determine the differences in sweet-related genes in two traditionally underrepresented ancestry groups in
genetic research, the non-Hispanic African and non-Hispanic Asian ancestry groups living in the U.S. We focus
on these groups because they have the highest and the lowest added sugars intake, respectively. We aim to
assess the differences in allele frequencies and effects of sweet-related genes on sweet preference in these
two groups. We hypothesize that the African group will have higher frequencies of sweet-related alleles and
stronger associations between the alleles and sweet preference compared to the Asian group. The second aim
will focus on understanding the effect of environment on sweet preference. The influence of environment on
sweet preference may be more apparent between individuals who were born in the U.S. (exposed to the food
environment in the U.S. since birth) and immigrants (exposed to different food environments). Immigrants may
retain traditional food habits and practices and therefore are less prone to the obesogenic food environment in
the U.S. We will compare the difference in sweet preference between individuals who are native-born vs.
immigrants within the same group of participants from Aim 1, adjusting for individual sweet intake. We expect
to see a lower sweet preference in immigrants compared to their U.S.-born counterparts of the same ancestry
group. The overall goal for this proposal is to understand the interactions between genetics and environmental
factors on sweet perception and human food preferences, thereby aligns with the NIDCD strategic goal to
understand how genes and environment affect food preferences. This study will be conducted at the City
University of New York – Brooklyn College, a racial/ethnically diverse university with 79% of the entering
undergraduate population eligible for federate or New York state financial aid. If awarded, the support I receive
from this project will afford me the opportunity to train students who are traditionally underrepresented in
biomedical research. As a new faculty, this opportunity will aid my transition from a postdoctoral fellow to
becoming an independent researcher and position me to becoming a leader in the sensory nutrition field."
10710377,"Background/Purpose: Physical rehabilitation of walking post-stroke is designed to improve individuals' mobility
in the presence of motor, sensory and balance impairments. Effective strategies to improve balance and
decrease fall risk continue to be a need in stroke rehabilitation. To address this, our laboratory has studied a
novel Backward Walking Training program (BWTraining) to improve both forward and backward walking speed
as well as balance in individuals with both acute and chronic stroke. Our prior published work has
demonstrated that this intervention is safe, feasible and effective, however, critical questions remain
unanswered regarding how best to deliver this intervention for optimal impact. The primary aim of this proposal
is to establish dosage effects of BWTraining for maximizing gains in forward walking speed, backward walking
speed, and dynamic balance. Additionally, we will determine baseline brain MRI predictors of response to
BWTraining intervention and explore changes in brain activity as a result of this behavioral intervention. We are
interested in understanding how individual differences in structural and functional brain measurements might
distinguish between responses to BWTraining. This information will promote prudent decision-making as to
which patients are good candidates for this novel intervention. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial
with three specific aims to test the 1) Dose effect of number of BWTraining sessions on walking speed and
balance, 2) the ability of resting state Functional Connectivity (rs-FC) between specified brain regions and
Blood Oxygen Level-Dependent (BOLD) activation of brain Regions Of Interest (ROIs) during task-based fMRI
to predict BWTraining outcomes and 3) changes in both rs-FC and BOLD activation during contralateral ankle
motion following BWTraining intervention compared to baseline.
Study Design: This is a randomized single-blind controlled trial.
Subjects: Forty-eight individuals, 2-4 months post-stroke, will meet the following study criteria: 1) ambulatory
with gait speed < 0.8 m/s; 2) community-dwelling; 3) Berg Balance Scale < 42; 4) absence of other
neurological conditions; 5) stable cardiac status; 6) absence of lower extremity orthopedic impairments or pain
that limits gait ability; 7) absence of metal and Magnetic Resonance sensitive implanted medical devices.
Methods: Following baseline Assessment A, participants will be randomized to an 18 or 27 session
BWTraining group. BWTraining intervention (3X/week for 6 or 9 weeks) consists of 20–30 minutes of step
training using a Body Weight Support and Treadmill system followed by 20 minutes of overground gait training.
Assessment B will occur after the final training session for each group. Assessment C will occur 6-weeks post-
intervention and Assessment D at six months post-intervention for both groups. Magnetic Resonance Imaging
of the brain consisting of rs-FC and BOLD blood flow in ROI's during an ankle motor task will be assessed at
Assessments A and B to address Specific Aim 2 and Specific Aim 3 respectively.
Outcome Measures: Primary outcome measure is forward gait speed. Secondary measures include backward
walking gait speed, dynamic balance measured by the Functional Gait Assessment and Center of Mass
Asymmetry, fall self-efficacy and spatial-temporal gait measures.
Data Analysis Plan: A sample size of 48 (24/group) provides 80% statistical power to detect a 0.11 m/s
difference in post-intervention gait speed between the 18- and 27-session groups at a 5% significance level
using a two-sample t-test. To assess training dose effect, a two-sample t-test will be performed on the primary
outcome, forward walking speed. The ability of rs-FC and BOLD activation of ROI's conducted pre-intervention
to predict intervention response will be assessed based on the correlation with gait speed change. Mean
connectivity strength for each network and mean signal intensity strength for each ROI will be compared pre-
to post-intervention."
10710378,"Hearing loss and tinnitus are the two most common service-related disabilities among
Veterans. These two conditions, together with the progressive effects associated with aging,
present an important challenge for effective Veteran care. Furthermore, treatment of tinnitus and
hearing loss has been shown to improve quality of life. Auditory rehabilitation for hearing loss
commonly includes hearing aids as a means to improve audibility and allow access to important
cues for accurate speech perception, which, in turn, promotes successful communication and
engagement in psychosocial aspects of life. Hearing aids have also been found to reduce the
bothersome ratings of those with tinnitus; in fact, some clinicians routinely fit hearing aids as a
primary means of tinnitus treatment, in some cases even when hearing thresholds are within the
normal range.
 In addition to the immediate audibility changes and treatment qualities related to
acoustic modification made by the hearing aid, amplification also has the potential to affect
higher level auditory processing abilities, such as speech perception in noise, cognition or other
abilities required for complex listening tasks the effects (e.g., effort). Long-term effects of
amplification, also known as acclimatization effects, are not well understood relative to more
immediate audibility-related effects. A better understanding of the long-term acclimatization
effects, together with more immediate audibility effects, will help audiologist to improve hearing
aid success and benefit among Veterans.
 An approach using psychophysical, physiological, cognitive, and questionnaire outcome
measures of both immediate audibility and long-term acclimatization effects that are associated
with hearing aid use may help to clarify the positive impacts of amplification as a rehabilitation
approach. The purpose of this study is to examine the way in which immediate audibility effects
and long-term auditory processing effects of amplification affect a range of outcome measures.
Improved measurement of the changes that occur with amplification will then help to understand
and improve rehabilitation success."
10915475,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is often accompanied by other autoimmune disorders, including autoimmune
neuropathies. Findings in both NOD mice and patients have revealed potential overlap between immune
responses targeting pancreatic b-cells and nerves. We hypothesized that lymphocyte populations involved in
T1D pathogenesis targeting proteins co-expressed in the nervous system may be the earliest responders
causing initial damage to peripheral nerves. These first responders provide the necessary trigger to expand
immune responses against myelin and other nervous system components traditionally studied in existing
mouse models of autoimmune neuritis. A vast majority of islet-infiltrating B-lymphocytes in NOD mice respond
to the nervous-system protein peripherin. Antibodies against phosphorylated peripherin have been identified in
T1D patients. We recently created a new mouse model (NOD-PerIg) in which B-lymphocytes transgenically
express the immunoglobulin molecule from the peripherin-reactive B-cell clone H280 isolated from islets. T1D
is accelerated in NOD-PerIg mice. T-cells from NOD-PerIg, but not NOD mice, transfer an autoimmune neuritis
similar to chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) to NOD.scid recipients. This new NOD-PerIg à
NOD.scid model of T1D-associated autoimmune neuritis provides an experimental system to directly dissect
the discreet stages of nerve cell infiltration and damage. We originally hypothesized that insulitis expanded T-
cells capable of causing neuritis. However, we have recently determined that T-cells derived from islets or
sciatic nerves in primary NOD.scid recipients are only capable of infiltrating the organ from which they were
derived. Therefore, experiments in Aim 1 will address the current unknowns regarding the discrete temporal
and spatial steps leading to cellular recruitment into peripheral nerves. We have also found that in addition to
the presence of IFNg and TNFa producing CD4+ T-cells, there is paradoxically an expansion of T-cells
negative for traditional Th1, Th2, and Th17 cytokines within sciatic nerves. An additional open question is
whether peripherin remains the antigen towards which T-cells are responding or whether there has been an
expansion of responses against other neuronal antigens. Therefore, studies in Aim 2 will dissect the
mechanisms by which T-cells destroy peripheral nerves and how an immune response against one shared b-
cell/neuronal antigen can spill over to a wider neuronal response. Finally, in large NOD colonies, spontaneous
clinical neuritis can be occasionally observed. We have found that at baseline, NOD mice (around the age of
T1D onset) already have sciatic nerve infiltrating T-cells. These T-cells are not observed in non-autoimmune
prone C57BL/6 mice. This indicates the likelihood that NOD harbors genetic loci contributing to spontaneous
nerve infiltration that can lead to spontaneous neuritis. Whether these loci are distinct or overlapping with loci
contributing to T1D is unknown. Therefore, studies in Aim 3 will map genes associated with spontaneous
nerve infiltration allowing future genetic screening of patients at risk for developing autoimmune neuropathy."

Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) and Alzheimer's disease related dementias
(ADRD) significantly contribute to the 55 million people world-wide who suffer with dementia. This number is
estimated to increase to over 139 million people by 2050 (WHO). A number of studies have shown that VCID and
conversion to ADRD are strongly correlated with vascular disease, inflammation and decreased cerebral brain
blood flow 1,2,3, 4,5,6, 7,8. The relationship between vascular disease, cognitive function and progression to
dementia and possible AD have been recently reviewed 9. These authors successfully make the case for a close
relationship between cardiovascular risk factors and risk for VCID and ADRD. Furthermore, conversion rates of
VCI to dementia has been reported to be within 40-46% within 5 years of diagnosis of VCI 10,11. There is an
urgent unmet medical need for therapeutics to prevent cognitive decline in individuals at risk for VCID.
The goal of this proposed late-stage NIA U01 ADDP program is to complete FDA-required long-term toxicology
and safety studies required to advance to a Phase 2 clinical trial of the anti-inflammatory peptide, PNA5, for
treatment of persons with MCI and are at risk for VCID/ADRD. The peptide PNA5 is a novel pleotropic anti-
inflammatory Angiotensin-(1-7)/MasR agonist that has outstanding brain penetration, enhanced bioavailability,
decreases brain and cerebrovascular inflammation, improves cerebral blood flow and restores cognitive function
in our preclinical VCID model 12,13,14,15. None of the other published studies with oral formulations of Ang-(1-7)
related peptides or small molecules 18,19,20 have exhibited the excellent brain penetration that we have observed
with our glycosylated peptides, which will be key for developing an effective CNS anti-inflammatory, cognitive
protective therapeutic. With support from the NIA, we are completing our early stage ADDP program, have
successfully completed our FDA pre-IND meeting, and will have our new FDA IND for PNA5 by Q3 2023. By the
time of this review, we will have completed our formal initial 28-day toxicology and safety work for PNA5 required
for Phase 1a first-in-human safety studies. In this application we are requesting support for 1) additional long-
term exposure safety analysis,2) expanded GMP manufacturing and final formulation and packaging for a Phase
2 trial, and 3) FDA regulatory documentation and design of the Phase 2 trial required to advance to Phase 2
clinical trials in persons with MCI at risk for VCID/ADRD.
Specific Aim I: Conduct six-month chronic toxicology studies in two species to determine the toxicokinetic and
safety profiles for subcutaneously administered PNA5.
Specific Aim II. Expanded GMP manufacturing and final fill and finish of PNA5 for Phase 2 trials in VCID.
Specific Aim III: Complete regulatory assessments and documentation for submission to FDA and to
generate Phase 2 clinical trial design and plan."
10886053,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignancy of the adult brain and is among the most
devastating cancers as it is invariably lethal. The perivascular niche and necrotic regions of GBM tumors
is enriched for stem-like tumor cells called GBM stem cells (GSCs) that are highly resistant to therapy.
Within GBM tumors there are also differentiated cells that are intrinsically resistant, or acquire resistance
to, therapy. Thus, there is a critical unmet need to identify and target the molecular pathways that
promote GBM cancer stemness, which will enhance GBM sensitivity to currently approved therapies. This
proposal is premised on several of our key findings: 1) the BRG1 catalytic subunit of the SWI/SNF
chromatin remodeling complex promotes the GBM GSC phenotype and resistance to DNA alkylating
agents such as temozolomide (TMZ) used to treat GBM patients; 2) PFI-3, a small molecule BRG1
bromodomain (BRD) inhibitor (BRI), improves GSC sensitivity to DNA alkylating agents by reducing GSC
stemness; 3) next generation BRIs were developed that overcome the resistance of TMZ-resistant GBM
cell lines, including a potent BRG1-specific BRI (IV-255); and 4) BRIs increase expression of a subclass
of interferon (IFN) response genes that are predicted to enhance the anti-tumoral host immune response.
Our central hypothesis is that targeting the BRD of BRG1 selectively disrupts GBM GSCs maintenance,
which enhances GBM sensitivity to approved therapies and increases GBM immunoreactivity. In Aim 1
we will restore BRG1 expression in BRG1-KD (knockdown) GSCs and in TMZ resistant GBM cells with
either wild-type BRG or mutant BRG1 BRD that prevents chromatin binding. We will examine the role of
the BRG1 BRD in maintaining the GBM malignant phenotype and therapeutic sensitivity in vitro and in
vivo. In Aim 2 we will refine the BRI structure and develop additional small molecule BRG1 BRIs. We will
define BRI activity on cancer stemness and therapeutic sensitivity on GBM in vitro and in vivo, and
assess selectivity for BRD binding, drug-like properties and optimize BBB penetrance. The anticancer
efficacy of BRIs on intracranial GBM tumors will be tested in both immunocompromised and
immunocompetent GBM mouse models to define their impact on tumor-associated immune cells. In Aim
3 we will define how BRD targeting of BRG1 reprograms transcription to promote GBM immunoreactivity
and inhibit tumorigenesis by performing global transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq), which will be coupled
with BRG1 and RNA polymerase II specific ChIP. These BRD-regulated genes will define the BRG1-
dependent transcriptome in GSCs, and it also will identify candidate molecular pathways that could be
pharmacologically targeted with BRG1 inhibition to get cancer cell synthetic lethality. Our overarching
goal is to target BRG1 therapeutically with BRIs combined with presently employed therapies as a novel
and urgently required therapeutic approach for this devastating form of brain cancer."
10890716,"Mosquito-borne viruses, primarily including families of Flaviviridae (dengue, Zika etc.) and Togaviridae
(Chikungunya etc.), infect roughly ~400 million people worldwide. By a blood meal, a naïve female mosquito
may acquire an infectious agent (e.g., virus) from an infected person, and pass it on to next person. Therefore,
the host-seeking and blood-feeding behavior of female mosquitoes is a key determinant of virus circulation in
nature. The mammalian body odors contain many volatile chemical compounds that influence mosquitoes’
behaviors. Some of these are well-characterized mosquito attractants. These cues vary from a person to another
person, and with the physiological conditions of the same person. However, it remains unknown if mosquito-
transmitted viruses can manipulate their host odors to influence mosquito behaviors. In a recent study, we found
that dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIKV) can manipulate their mammalian host skin microbiota to produce a potent
mosquito attractant, acetophenone. This was because viral infection significantly increased the abundance of
skin Bacillus bacteria, the major producer of acetophenone as a volatile metabolite. DENV/ZIKV downregulated
(~25-fold) the expression of a resistin-like bactericidal antimicrobial peptide (AMP), RELMα, in the mouse skin.
These results demonstrate that DENV/ZIKV can enhance their host attractiveness to mosquitoes, thus facilitate
their transmission. However, how these viruses inhibit RELMα expression is unknown. Constitutive RELMα
expression (not any other skin AMPs) requires dietary retinols (a.k.a vitamin A), suggesting that DENV/ZIKV
likely intervenes retinol signaling. Retinols are bound by retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4) and transported by a
cell surface receptor STRA6, converted into retinaldehydes by retinol dehydrogenase 1 (RDH1), then to retinoic
acids by retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 1A (RALDH1A). Retinoic acids bind retinoic acid receptors (RARs), which
enter the nucleus and activate gene transcription, including RELMα and RARs. Intriguingly, oral administration
of a retinoic acid, isotretinoin, restored normal RELMα expression and skin microbial homeostasis to
DENV/ZIKV-infected mice, suggesting that DENV/ZIKV target a step between retinol and retinoic acid. Indeed,
our new data showed that DENV/ZIKV replicated productively and suppressed RELMα and RAR expression
induced by retinol, but not by retinaldehyde or isotretinoin in mouse primary skin epidermal keratinocytes, the
primary epidermal cell type and producer of AMPs. Of note, the Chikungunya virus did not inhibit retinol signaling.
Therefore, we hypothesize that DENV/ZIKV interferes with a step between retinol and retinaldehyde of the retinol
pathway. To this end, we will pinpoint the step of the retinol pathway targeted by DENV/ZIKV, and identify the
viral protein (s) that suppress the retinol pathway. We will address how these flaviviruses suppress the retinol
pathway and RELMα expression in the skin. These results could be applicable to other mosquito-borne
flaviviruses and lay a foundation for in-depth mechanistic studies."

The highly innovative Rapid Autopsy Program (RAP) addresses a major limitation in pancreatic and prostate
cancer research: the lack of quality human specimens of cancer representing all stages of disease. This
program, led by Dr. Paul M. Grandgenett, which includes rapid collection of large quantities of all organs and
fluids within 5 hours of death, is a unique program in the world and is designed to maintain cellular and
molecular integrity of the tissue. The RAP is a core component of the University of Nebraska Medical Center
(UNMC) Pancreatic Cancer Research program and the GU Oncology Focus Group, that is tasked with the
collection, archiving and distribution of tissues and fluids from patients that have recently passed with pancreas
or prostate cancer. The Unit Director of the Pancreatic Cancer Research program at the Fred and Pamela
Buffett Cancer Center is Dr. Michael A. Hollingsworth, while the prostate group is led by Dr. Surinder Batra and
Dr. Shawna Boyle. Dr. Grandgenett, a Research Associate Professor under Dr. Hollingsworth's aegis, is the
director of the RAP and the applicant for this Research Specialist Award. The rapid autopsy program operates
within the Pancreatic Cancer Research Program at UNMC and is important to and currently funded in part by:
a pancreatic cancer SPORE p50 grant; ongoing and pending P01 and U01 grants and several R01 grants to
individual investigators. Dr. Grandgenett personally directs the collection of primary tumor, residual unaffected
tissues, distant metastases, all unaffected tissues, as well as fluids such as blood and ascites for all PDAC and
Prostate cancer patients. He has also established an extensive normal tissue acquisition program that is highly
utilized. Dr. Grandgenett determines in advance how specific samples will be prioritized based on the needs of
funded projects both at UNMC and at other institutions. Currently, Dr. Grandgenett provides fresh samples to
multiple laboratories, at UNMC and outside-UNMC, conducting research on blood-based biomarkers (proteins,
RNA, DNA), circulating tumor cells, patient-derived modeling including organoids and xenografts, and other
processes. The remaining samples are snap frozen, maintained in long-term storage and made available
through request and collaboration for local, national and international cancer studies. Key roles of Dr.
Grandgenett is to coordinate the training and participation of the thirty RAP volunteers and to work with
collaborators to determine the samples necessary for their research project, to modify our SOP as needed to
obtain those samples, confirm specimen quality and then to distribute those samples to investigators. It is
essential for the leadership of this resource to be a highly trained Research Specialist with extensive
experience through participation in the autopsies, a comprehensive knowledge of patient sample availability,
as well as the ability to interact on a scientific level with each investigator. Dr. Grandgenett has a major role in
all aspects of the collection, processing, annotation and distribution of these biospecimens and plays a vital
role in expanding collaborative projects with investigators at UNMC and on a national and international level."
10893998,"PROJECT SUMMARY
What we know: There are 1.1 million persons living with HIV (PLH) in the US: at least 40% smoke and most
want to quit. Almost none are currently accessing smoking cessation interventions designed to meet their specific
needs and concerns. PLH who smoke have high rates of nicotine dependence, depression, and loneliness. Lung
cancer due to tobacco use is a leading killer of people living with HIV (PLH), accounting for up to 61.5% of
mortality. PLH who smoke reduce their life expectancy by 12.3 years on average. The lack of access to proven,
effective, and HIV-tailored tobacco cessation services represents a health disparity of the first order. Eighty-one
percent of PLH use the Internet and most do so on their own technology–making group-based video-
conferencing–accessed through the Internet a promising avenue to deliver smoking cessation treatment.
Although cessation programs are widely offered to the general public, there are no evidence-based programs
available specifically for PLH and none found effective long-term for this population; no programs provide group-
based video-conferencing (VG for video-groups); and no PLH-specific programs provide smoking cessation
booster sessions. What we will do: In this rigorous trial, the efficacy of a PLH-specific cessation program (PSF-
VG), guided by the Social Cognitive Theory, will be compared to an attention matched control condition (AMC;
prevention with positives) in a randomized control trial. Participants will be N=482 PLH smokers recruited from
Florida who are motivated to quit within the next 30 days. All participants will be offered nicotine replacement
therapy and brief cessation counseling in addition to an 8-session intervention with booster sessions (PSF-VG
or AMC). The primary outcome will be biochemically confirmed 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 12 months
follow-up, although 30-day point prevalence abstinence and sustained abstinence (continuous abstinence post-
quit day after a 2-week grace period) will be assessed, as well. We will also determine the cost per additional
quit, an important cost-effectiveness measure for smoking cessation. We will examine model-driven hypotheses
about the mediators of treatment outcome (e.g., knowledge, motivation to quit, self-efficacy), and explore effects
on CD4 count and virologic suppression. Implications: 1) This trial will represent one of the most rigorous trials
of tobacco cessation among PLH to date, given the AMC and 360-day follow-up period. 2) Establishing the long-
term efficacy of a VG smoking cessation program for PLH, which reaches PLH “where they are,” will represent
an enormous advance in the fight against tobacco use in PLH and provide a clearer understanding of the role of
targeted, ehealth health interventions in comprehensive HIV care. 3) Determining the costs associated with this
program will be critical for making real world implementation decisions. 4) Establishing effect mediators will help
identify to what extent PSF-VG is working as intended and help build the mechanistic science of HIV smoking
cessation. 5) Examining changes in CD4 and viral load will add to our understanding about how smoking
cessation confers benefits for health in PLH. Thus, this study will likely have a high impact on the field."

The goal of this proposal is to obtain pre-clinical data to enable the translation of a novel nanotechnology-based
drug combination to treat triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC accounts for ∼10-20% of breast cancers
and is associated with relatively poor prognosis, earlier disease recurrence and higher number of visceral
metastases. Chemotherapy, in particular with anthracyclines and taxanes, remains the backbone medical
management for both early and metastatic TNBC but a significant proportion of patients with early-stage TNBC
unfortunately develop metastatic disease. Combination treatments using platinates and taxanes were shown to
increase pathologic complete response rates in TNBC and improve survival in neoadjuvant treatment settings.
We propose to use nanotechnology to improve the treatment of TNBC by co-delivering platinum and taxane
drugs in the same nanoparticle to attack cancer cells in a synergistic fashion and produce greater antitumor
effect. To address poor miscibility and drug loading of platinates and taxanes in many nanoparticles, we propose
to use a high capacity polymeric micelles (PMs) of poly(2-oxazolne) (POx) block copolymers to incorporate
drugs. In preliminary work we developed POXOL-CP PMs, a combination of PTX and hydrophobic cisplatin
prodrug co-loaded in POx block copolymer micelles that has shown pharmacological synergy of solubilized
drugs, better delivery of both drugs to tumors and improved efficacy in several animal models compared to the
small molecule agents or their combination administered separately. The goal of this proposal is to obtain
additional pre-GLP data for our new combination nanotherapeutic in rodent and non-human primate (NHP)
models, develop validated assays and procedures for POXOL-CP PMs, further demonstrate its safety and
efficacy and establish path for translation of POXOL-CP PMs to the clinic for TNBC patients. The project
addresses the following aims: 1) Manufacture reproducible, stable, and safe POXOL-CP PMs, validate its safety
and improved drug delivery to tumors in a mouse model of TNBC; 2) Demonstrate activity of POXOL-CP PMs
compared to standard of care in Orthotopic Syngeneic Transplant (OST) and Genetically Engineered Mouse
Models (GEMM) of TNBC that recapitulate the human disease. 3) Assess safety and PK profiles of POXOL-CP
PMs in rat and NHP models. We will follow Good Experimental Practice (GEP) in data keeping and recording
and develop Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) and follow guidance of a clinical and translational panel. If
successful the results of this project will allow forming data package to support the Good Laboratory Practice
(GLP) and Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) work and compete for NCI Experimental Therapeutics (NExT)
program, and/or other resources to advance development of POXOL-CP PMs on a path to the clinic to improve
treatment outcomes for patients with TNBC."

improve the life of Mississippi children by providing exceptional patient care, training the next generation of
healthcare providers, and engaging in innovative research to achieve the vision of UMMC to improve
Mississippian's health outcomes and eliminate health care disparities. Researchers in the newborn division are
contributing by performing innovative, definitive, rigorous, and reproducible translation, single and multi-site

The newborn center at the UMMC is exceptionally well positioned to be selected for the following reasons. 1)
We serve a very high-risk and underserved population, the majority with low socioeconomic status and public
insurance from urban and rural areas with high representation of racial/ethnic minorities facing health
disparities. 2) Mississippi has some of the highest rates of maternal hypertension, preeclampsia, obesity,
metabolic disorders, preterm birth, low birth weight, and congenitally linked behavioral disorders, such as
autism in the USA. 3) The Center for Maternal and Fetal Care at UMMC, the only quaternary center for
advanced fetal care in the state, manages around 3,000 deliveries each year, of which 75% are considered
high risk. 4) About 1000 NICU admissions per year, of which almost 160 are born less than 29 weeks of
gestation, and about 70% are inborn. 5) The Division of Newborn Medicine has a well-organized clinical
research infrastructure with a successful track record of participation in multi-center NIH, industry-sponsored,
and investigator-initiated clinical trials in newborns. 6) The Division has consistently been the highest study
subject recruiting site in many multi-center clinical trials. This success is attributable to the strong research
culture and a unique system of round-the-clock availability of dedicated research coordinators, including after-

Skeletal stem cells (SSCs) are necessary for the homeostasis and repair of bone and cartilage. In craniofacial
bones, periosteal skeletal stem/progenitor cells (P-SSCs) and suture mesenchymal cells play a critical role in
bone homeostasis and regeneration. However, due to the restricted distribution and lack of specific markers,
little is known about the function of craniofacial P-SSCs and about their specific regulatory mechanisms in
homeostasis and response to bone injury. Patients with Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) have dysregulation of
craniofacial and skeletal bone homeostasis. WNT1 mutations cause recessive OI and early onset
osteoporosis and our preliminary data support altered craniofacial stem cell function. Therefore, the main
objective of this research proposal is to define the in vivo characteristics and unique regulatory mechanisms of
craniofacial P-SSCs, and to test if Wnt1 and α-sclerostin antibody augmentation of Wnt signaling in general are
critical for these P-SSCs' response to bone injury. We hypothesize that craniofacial P-SSCs have unique
molecular characteristics compared to long bone P-SSCs and that the regulation of these P-SSCs by Wnt1 is
critical for craniofacial bone homeostasis, regeneration and repair. In combination with previously known SSC
markers, we have newly identified selective markers for P-SSCs that enables us to isolate highly purified
mouse P-SSCs and to analyze their gene expression profiles and to test their bone forming ability by
transplantation of these P-SSCs into calvarial defects. We thus propose to answer the below questions in
achieving the specific aims: Specific Aim 1: What are unique characteristics and function of craniofacial P-
SSCs compared to long-bone P-SSCs. Specific Aim 2: How does Wnt1 signaling regulate the maintenance
and function of craniofacial P-SSCs? Specific Aim 3: What are the functional consequences of loss or gain of
Wnt1, and α-sclerostin therapy on craniofacial bone regeneration? These studies will identify factors that
regulate the specification of SSC from different calvarial and long bone sources and the contribution of Wnt1
and effects of α-Sost treatment in regulating bone formation, and the proliferation, migration, and differentiation
of neural crest derived-sutural vs. periosteal SSCs in homeostasis and repair."
10884225,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by rapid growth, early dissemination, and exceptionally poor
prognosis. The Rudin laboratory has focused on the study of SCLC for over 2 decades using a fully integrated
platform of basic discovery and clinical translational research. Our laboratory has driven fundamental advances
in the understanding and characterization of SCLC. We have excelled in successfully translated many
discoveries made by our group into clinical testing, including many active trials currently being conducted by our
clinical team. Closing the circle, we are also deeply engaged in the molecular characterization of biospecimens
from patients receiving these novel therapies, to better inform new directions of laboratory research while
maintaining direct disease relevance. In this R35 we will focus primarily on three main areas of future focus for
our group. (1) Recent extensive single cell profiling data from our laboratory has defined the exceptional intra-
and inter-tumoral heterogeneity of primary human SCLC. We have identified a key subpopulation with stem-like
capacity, present in tumors of all SCLC subtypes, and also identified and characterized a novel tumor-infiltrating
macrophage subtype exclusively associated with SCLC. The stem-like cell population expands progressively in
nodal and distant metastases, and high fraction of this subpopulation confers a strikingly poor clinical prognosis.
Defining, characterizing, and targeting these novel cell types could have a transformative impact on patients with
SCLC. (2) We have a long-standing interest in lineage plasticity, including histologic transformation from lung
adenocarcinoma to SCLC, and tumor evolution between SCLC subtypes. We now have multiple relevant tools
in hand to dissect the biology of lineage plasticity in lung cancer, including patient-derived xenograft (PDX)
models of lung adenocarcinoma that under different conditions transition to different subtypes of SCLC. We will
deeply analyze the drivers of SCLC transformation as a mechanism of tumor escape and acquired resistance in
lung cancer. These data will inform approaches to prevent or restrict lineage plasticity as a driver of therapeutic
resistance. (3) We have developed new technology allowing controlled in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in
PDX. We will adapt this system to conduct focused SCLC genetic dependency screens in vivo using a guide
RNA library covering the druggable genome. Applied across all subtypes of SCLC, this approach will define
novel therapeutic targets for this recalcitrant malignancy."
10911854,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 The widespread nature of epigenetic abnormalities in human cancers has become increasingly appreciated
in the past decade, with clinical impacts in cancer detection, cancer classification, chemoresistance prediction,
and therapy. Large-scale cancer genomic screens have revealed a previously unrecognized prevalence of
somatic mutations among epigenetic regulators in human cancers, including chromatin remodelers, as well as
histone or DNA methylation readers, writers, and erasers. Epigenetic alterations can serve as driver events in
cancer by inactivating tumor-suppressor genes. The finding that these silencing events are mutually exclusive
with structural or mutational inactivation of the same gene reinforces the functional significance of epigenetic
silencing. The majority of cases of microsatellite instability in sporadic human tumors can be attributed to
epigenetic silencing of the MLH1 mismatch repair gene. Clearly, epigenetic mechanisms play a key role in
human cancer, and a comprehensive molecular characterization of cancer should include epigenomic profiling.
In 2015 we established an Integrative Cancer Epigenomic Data Analysis Center (ICE-DAC) to provide
specialized expertise in epigenomic data analysis as part of the Genome Data Analysis Network (GDAN). We
have made major contributions to the GDAN in the past five years, developing cutting-edge DNA methylation
bioinformatics tools, leading analysis teams in PanCanAtlas, ATAC-Seq, Pan-Gastrointestinal (Pan-GI)
Cancers and Tumor Molecular Pathology (TMP), and making major contributions to the Exceptional
Responders (ER) study, testicular germcell tumors (TGCT), data harmonization (QC), CCG Ancestry
Informative Markers (AIM), and many other projects. Here we propose to sustain this productive activity in a
continuation of the ICE-DAC, lending our deep expertise in epigenomic data analysis to collaborative,
integrative genomic and epigenomic analyses of clinical specimens within the NCI GDAN. In Specific Aim 1,
we will provide advanced specialized analysis of bulk and single-cell cancer epigenomic data generated by
programs within the NCI Center for Cancer Genomics. We have developed various tools for epigenetic
analysis and implemented an automated workflow to provide timely primary data analysis for AWGs. In
Specific Aim 2 we will implement innovative tools to extract additional information from specialized data types.
This Aim maximizes the utility of the data generated, and adds to the rigor of analysis by providing orthogonal
validation. These analyses will include prediction of common covariates (such as sex, age and race) for the
samples, analysis of tumor purity and composition, inferences of genetic information (including genetic
mutation, copy number and large structural variants), all from the DNA methylation assays. In Specific Aim 3
we will integrate epigenomic data with other genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and clinical data to derive
biologically and clinically relevant novel insights. Our deep expertise in specialized epigenomics will address a
core competency required in GDAN, and complement other genomic analyses of clinical trial samples."
10897123,"Project Summary/Abstract
Genome editing is an exciting avenue for treating common and rare genetic diseases, and the advent of
CRISPR/Cas technologies has accelerated the development of this therapeutic option. These therapies rely on
cellular DNA repair machinery to install their edits, so changes in the balance between DNA repair pathways
result in different editing patterns. This dependency on endogenous DNA repair has led to considerable variability
in editing efficiency between cell types or even among targets in the same cell. Thus, a long-term goal of my
laboratory is to investigate factors that modify the efficacy of genome editing and to develop strategies that
address these shortcomings. Histone modifications play a role in many cellular processes, including
transcriptional regulation and DNA repair. Recent evidence found that histone modifications correlate with biases
for specific DNA repair pathways. However, given their role in multiple processes, interpreting the effects of
individual histone modifications has been challenging. I will dissect these effects to define the role of histone
modifications in the repair of double-strand breaks by innovating a platform that recruits histone modifiers to
thousands of break sites in parallel. This work will determine whether histone modifications influence DNA repair
and uncover properties of the target site that predict these effects. For genome editing to reach its therapeutic
potential, precise control of DNA repair is required. I will identify peptides from the human proteome that alter
the repair of double-strand breaks. To do this, I will adapt a peptide screening platform I developed to investigate
DNA repair. The peptides will reveal critical protein-protein interactions and other methods for altering DNA
repair. The completion of these projects will significantly advance our understanding of mammalian DNA repair
and has the potential to improve genome editing therapies."

Chemical methodologies for the predictable transformation of hydrocarbons to functional synthetic intermediates
have revolutionized the preparation of small-molecule therapeutics. Nonetheless, the continued development of
new chemical tools that compliment current existing technologies and address gaps in synthetic strategy offer
the potential to further accelerate drug innovation and imaging techniques. The goal of this proposed research
program is to develop new areas of asymmetric catalysis by means of chiral ionic intermediates. More
specifically, the two research areas proposed here are centered on the study of catalysts that promote the
stereoselective trapping of cationic intermediates to address longstanding challenges in synthesis. The first
research area will focus on the development of novel strategies for catalytic enantioselective halogenation via
chiral Lewis base catalysis. This work draws upon our initial findings in this area regarding the Lewis base
activation of latent halide sources for the catalytic generation of chiral halogenating reagents. The second
research area details a conceptually novel approach for the generation of chiral molecules via hydride abstraction
processes. Specifically, we aim to exploit the reactivity and selectivity of superacid catalysts to enable the regio-
and stereoselective functionalization of saturated hydrocarbons. This strategy represents the starting point for a
broader research program aimed at developing a new mode of asymmetric Csp3–H functionalization. Taken
together, these research programs will expand the available chemical space and streamline chemical synthesis
for drug discovery and development."
10913520,"Research Abstract: The spike/fusion glycoproteins residing on the surface of human enveloped viruses are
targets of immune response and are the focus of researchers developing vaccines and antiviral treatments. The
conformational dynamics of spike proteins drive the entry of enveloped viruses into cells via viral membrane
fusion and facilitate antibody recognition. However, the lack of deep insights into dynamics has prevented a
complete elucidation of the molecular mechanism by which spike proteins promote virus entry. Many viruses,
such as coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and HIV-1, share a similar viral fusion
mechanism (type-I) mediated by their respective spike proteins. These spikes undergo dramatic structural
changes, and the energy released from conformational transitions overcomes the fusion kinetic barriers.
However, our understanding of the multi-step fusion process mainly relies on individual structural snapshots of
spike proteins at fusion endpoints. How these endpoints are correlated in a time-resolved manner and the order
and frequency of conformational events underlying virus entry remain largely elusive. The proposed research
extends our efforts to explore viral membrane fusion and is supported by our experience probing the
conformational dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and HIV-1 envelope (Env) glycoproteins. The overarching
goal of this project is to integrate our knowledge into a generic working model that will describe a time-resolved
stepwise framework of the type-I fusion mechanism, in which the conformational trajectories of fusion proteins
are explicitly defined in space and time. We pioneered the use of the single-molecule Förster resonance energy
transfer (smFRET) to study S and revealed multiple S conformations on the virus. We delineated sequential
transitions of S from closed to open conformations upon activation by cellular receptors. We provided the first
experimental evidence of decelerated transition dynamics from open states, suggesting increased stability of the
fusion-reactive open state to be part of the SARS-CoV-2 adaption strategies. Here, we will use an integrated
platform of smFRET and virus-to-cell fusion in combination with computational and structural tools to reveal the
conformational plasticity S adapts during virus evolution and to visualize the conformational trajectory S
undergoes during fusion. We will perform comparative studies on another respiratory virus - RSV fusion (F)
protein, with interest in other type-I spike proteins of newly emerging viruses. We will elucidate conformational
events and transition dynamics of F-mediated viral membrane fusion and evaluate whether conformation-
presentation of F-based vaccine candidates represents the predominant state exposed to the host. The studies
are expected to allow us to identify the common and divergent traits of the S- and F-mediated fusion processes
that will advance our knowledge and help us define the common theme of the type-I fusion mechanism. We
envision that this program of research using different advanced technologies will reveal unrecognized insights
into virus entry that lay the foundation for advances in anti-viral interventions, in line with the mission of NIGMS."

Sleep is a fundamental biological process that is essential for survival in animals. Humans normally spend ~ 30%
of our lifetime sleeping, but sleep disorders are prevalent in modern societies. Sleep abnormalities not only affect
daily performance but also lead to adverse effects on neuronal function and contribute to neurological and other
diseases. Thus, it is imperative to understand how and why we sleep. However, it remains largely unclear how
sleep is controlled at the molecular, cellular, and circuit levels, partially due to the complexity of sleep regulation.
A fundamental question about sleep is how the brain controls different sleep-associated behavioral changes to
induce a robust sleep state. Our long-term goal is to build a comprehensive understanding of basic genetic
pathways and neural mechanisms underlying sleep regulation. Sleep is an evolutionarily conserved process,
with shared features across different organisms that include behavioral quiescence, increased arousal threshold,
and rapid reversibility to wakefulness. In line with this, recent studies in simple model organisms, such as worms,
fruit flies, and zebrafish, have yielded valuable insights into sleep regulation. We propose to study a simple and
robust stress-induced sleep (SIS) state in C. elegans: cellular stress activates epidermal growth factor (EGF)
signaling primarily within a single neuron (ALA) to induce sleep. How does a single neuron control a
302-neuron brain to drive C. elegans into a sleep state? To address this question, we will exploit the
advantages of C. elegans, such as powerful genetics, short life cycle, optical transparency, and a compact
nervous system. Our central hypothesis is that activation of EGF signaling in the ALA neuron induces sleep
through the actions of distinct yet potentially overlapping molecular pathways and neural circuits that coordinate
various sleep behavioral phenotypes. To test this hypothesis, we propose two projects: 1) perform a set of
genetic screens and mutant analyses to identify new sleep regulatory genes and 2) perform brain-wide functional
circuit mapping to identify the neural basis for SIS at single-neuron resolution. We will systematically manipulate
and visualize the activity of individual neurons in the entire nervous system of C. elegans through a combination
of optogenetics, chemogenetics, in vivo calcium imaging, and a powerful GAL4-based bipartite expression
system (cGAL) we developed. The proposed research is significant because it will provide a mechanistic view
of how sleep operates at the molecular, cellular, and circuit levels. This study will also potentially transform
approaches of functional circuit analyses in C. elegans because the cGAL reagents produced in this study will
become a powerful resource for the entire research community and can be readily used to dissect underlying
neural circuits for other behaviors."

Adolescents and young adults (AYA) are disproportionately affected by HIV in the US. Despite adolescents
accounting for over 20% of new infections, this age group is the least likely to be tested for HIV, linked to care,
and achieve viral suppression when compared to their adult counterparts. Further, AYA also have low rates of
HIV awareness and initiation of HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP). Therefore, there is an urgent need to
expand HIV screening and prevention strategies to nontraditional healthcare settings such as emergency
departments (ED) to reach those adolescents who would otherwise not receive preventive healthcare. The goal
of this application is to leverage our recent insights obtained from a multi-center, ED-based, adolescent
gonorrhea and chlamydia screening study and apply them across a national pediatric ED research network by (1)
adapting, refining, and testing this process to increase universally offered, opt-out HIV screening among
adolescents in the pediatric ED and (2) link at-risk adolescents to PrEP services and preventive care. This will be
accomplished through a network of children’s hospital EDs with a track record of robust research collaboration
(Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network or PECARN). This research will contribute to the
evidence base for creating clinically effective and sustainable HIV screening programs that can be successfully
implemented into the clinical workflow of the ED. It will also improve identification and linkage to PrEP care for at
risk adolescents using mHealth strategies by first identifying AYA who are PrEP candidates based on their
responses to a computerized sexual health screen (cSHS) and subsequently (1) providing clinical decision
support to providers via the electronic health record and (2) direct text messaging from the cSHS to PrEP
candidates providing educational content and connecting youth to a PrEP navigator. This intervention will rely on
an innovative approach that electronically integrates patient-reported data to guide clinical decision support. This
work is significant because it has the potential to shift current ED clinical practice paradigms from only acute
health encounters to participation in the broader management of public health and prevention, and it will fill gaps
in the literature needed to provide evidence for the best method of HIV screening in a pediatric ED setting. Using
a previously developed tablet-based, broad scale GC/CT screening process, we will adapt, refine, and test this
process with the aim of increasing universally offered, opt-out HIV screening in the pediatric ED through
electronic integration of patient reported data for provision of clinical decision support for HIV screening and
identification of PrEP candidacy, and then use mHealth to link patients to PrEP services. This research is novel in
that it shifts the usual clinical practice paradigm of HIV screening and prevention in the pediatric ED from a
scattered approach to a consistent and sustainable approach that is critical to addressing the HIV epidemic
among adolescents."

Inter-organelle membrane contact sites (MCSs) are emerging as critical hubs that regulate metabolic pathways
which enables cellular adaptation to external perturbations and environmental stress. Because of their roles in
cellular metabolism, dysregulation of MCSs has been linked to numerous metabolic and neurodegenerative
disorders as well as aging. Numerous studies to date have linked MCSs to non-vesicular lipid transfer and
spatial organization of lipid metabolism. Using yeast as a model system, we found that contact sites between
the Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the lysosome recruit lipid enzymes to spatially organize lipid synthesis
and storage as a response to lipotoxic stress. Lipid biosynthesis is intimately linked to methionine metabolism.
Specifically, S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) which is a direct product of methionine, is an essential methyl donor
required for membrane lipid biosynthesis. However, how MCSs regulate the availability and utilization of non-
lipidic metabolites such as SAM is currently unknown. Surprisingly, we found that deletion of ER-lysosome
tethers in yeast significantly alters SAM levels and sensitizes yeast to methionine-deprivation. In addition to
providing methyl groups for phospholipid methylation, SAM is involved in other cellular functions such as
nutrient signaling, epigenetic regulation, and maintaining redox balance. Therefore, lowering SAM levels by
perturbing ER-lysosome contact sites will have direct consequences on these essential cellular pathways.
Based on these results, we propose that lipid synthesis at ER-lysosome contact sites regulates SAM
availability, which serves as an important driver for regulating downstream cellular pathways. The central goal
of this proposal is to test this hypothesis by 1) elucidating the mechanisms by which ER-lysosome tethers
regulate phospholipid synthesis; 2) determining the functional consequences for altered compartmentalization
of phospholipid methylation; 3) defining molecular and structural basis for lipid binding and transport by ER-
lysosome tethers; and 4) identifying conserved mechanisms for SAM regulation by ER-lysosome contact sites.
Collectively, the results of our studies will provide insight into the organizational aspects of SAM regulation,
how this alters the lipidome, and its relationship to aging and metabolic diseases."

liposomes composed of phospholipids and cholesterol, similar to those used in patients, doubled tumor size in
mice by suppressing the immune response against tumors. We recently identified macrophages as the cells that
are responsible for these detrimental effects. In this proposal, we seek to identify the precise molecular
mechanisms. Our preliminary data show that liposomal cholesterol is metabolized into oxysterols that are known
to alter the function of macrophages. Based on this, we theorize that liposomal oxysterols cause macrophages
to suppress antitumor immunity and enhance tumor growth. Notably, oxidized metabolites of beta-sitosterol (a
plant sterol) lack the protumoral inflammatory activity of oxysterols, suggesting that more efficacious liposomal
drug formulations can be developed using analogs of cholesterol. The objectives of this proposal are to
understand the metabolism of liposomal cholesterol and to develop cholesterol analogs without tumorigenic
effects for liposomal drug formulation. We will dissect the metabolism pathways by conducting time-dependent
studies in immune cells and in mouse models. To identify the metabolic and cell signaling pathways that are
involved, we will conduct mechanistic studies in wildtype and knockout mice, and donor human immune cells.
Finally, we will design and test the immunological and anticancer effects of cholesterol analogs in immune cells
and in mouse models of cancer. Our team has unique combined expertise necessary for successful completion
of this project. This proposal is expected to have a positive impact by addressing critical gaps in current
understanding of the role of the immune system in liposomal drug pharmacology and the role of oxidized sterols
in cancer. This is likely to lead to new therapeutic targets and drug formulation strategies with potential to
significantly advance both cancer drug delivery and immunotherapy."

The calcium (Ca2+) release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels mediate Ca2+ influx in response to Ca2+ store
depletion in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), generating Ca2+ signals critical for many cellular processes.
Activation of CRAC channels requires the interaction of Orai and STIM proteins, which are the plasma membrane
Ca2+ channel and the Ca2+ sensor in the ER membrane; however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains
incompletely understood. Mammals, including humans, have three Orai channels (Orai1, Orai2, and Orai3) and
two STIM proteins (STIM1 and STIM2), whereas Drosophila has only one set of Orai and STIM. Both loss- and
gain-of-function mutations that underlie human diseases have been identified in human Orai1 and STIM1. The
physiological roles of Orai2 and Orai3 are less well understood, but there is emerging evidence showing that
they could form heteromeric channels with Orai1, which might play roles distinct from channels formed by Orai1
and STIM1. The long-term goal of my research program is to study the molecular regulation of the CRAC channel
signaling pathway in order to understand the molecular mechanisms of the diverse functions the CRAC channels
play in different tissues and cells under physiological and pathological conditions. Initially, we are prioritizing
structure-function studies of the Drosophila Orai-STIM complex and human CRAC channels to launch my
research program. In this proposed research, we aim to address key knowledge gaps in (1) the biochemistry
and structural biology of the Orai-STIM interaction, (2) the structure and function of human CRAC channels, and
(3) regulation of CRAC channels by cellular factors and channel modulators. We will bring innovative approaches
and apply the Principal Investigator’s experience in structural biology and ion channel structure-function studies
to address these questions. Specifically, we will determine the atomic structure of the Drosophila Orai-STIM
complex as well as structures of human Orai channels and human Orai-STIM complexes. We will also develop
novel functional approaches and tools for structure-guided functional analysis of CRAC channels. In addition,
we propose to study the regulation of the channel structure and function by small molecule modulators including
lipids and pharmacological drugs. Finally, we will use functional, biochemical, and structural biology methods
(including both X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy) to characterize the protein-protein
interaction of Orai or STIM with a multitude of endogenous protein regulators. In the next five years, we aim to
gain a deeper mechanistic understanding of the regulation of the CRAC channel signaling pathway and construct
the foundation of knowledge and research tools to understand and study the broader signaling network in which
the CRAC channels reside."
10930044,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Postpartum depression (PPD) is the most common medical complication of childbirth that remains
underrecognized and undertreated. Children’s Hospitals are ideal sites for postpartum mental healthcare
because mothers in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) are at high risk and those seeking care in the
Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) often miss routine office visits with a pediatrician or obstetrician. The
first step to reducing the negative consequences associated with untreated PPD is timely screening and self-
awareness of depressive symptoms. However, screening NICU mothers and in the PED is uncommon,
expensive, personnel-heavy, and time-consuming. The second step is referral and treatment which is
multifaceted and requires parents to navigate different parts of the healthcare system, a vast endeavor for a
depressed individual. Redesign of healthcare systems to permit seamless screening, referral, and treatment of
mothers with PPD creating an efficient “one-stop-shop solution” is urgently needed. Our long-term goal is to
provide safe, comprehensive, point-of-care access to mental health services for parents of infants treated in
children’s hospitals. The overall objective is to create a Perinatal Mood and Anxiety Disorder (PMAD) Learning
Laboratory using a five-phase systems engineering approach that develops new solutions for clinical
recognition and therapy for PPD. Our specific aims are 1. To optimize screening, referral, and treatment for
postpartum depression in the NICU and PED using system dynamics group model building techniques. We will
analyze the current workflow, identify barriers, elicit system requirements from stakeholders, map the system,
and develop a system dynamics simulation model to test solutions in a virtual environment. 2. To design a
novel software dashboard for real-time tracking of eligible mothers with its accompanying parent-facing app
and develop a predictive model to identify at-risk mothers. We will then develop a measurement system to
monitor key performance indicators. 3. To implement new solutions, monitor, and evaluate the system for
unintended consequences before and after implementation. A difference in difference, and cost-benefit
analysis will be conducted to evaluate the changes. Our PMAD Learning Lab is innovative because it is a
significant departure from traditional techniques using novel approaches and new technology to assist in the
recognition and treatment of PPD on a large scale in real-world settings in the NICU and PED of a free-
standing children’s hospital. This is significant because if successful it will be generalizable to the treatment of
other mental health disorders that affect postpartum parents and will contribute to improvement in short- and
long-term health outcomes of parents and infants who are at a higher risk than the general maternal
population."
10893643,"Project Summary
Archaea in the human gut express methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) to catalyze the last step of
methanogenesis and the first step of the anaerobic oxidation of methane. These reactions occur at F430, a
nickel cofactor whose first coordination sphere — the ligands directly bound to it — includes the four nitrogen
atoms of a unique anionic macrocycle. This center reversibly cleaves the thioether methyl-coenzyme M (CoM–
SMe) to release methyl radical, which combines with thiol coenzyme B (HS–CoB) in the second coordination
sphere — the residues proximal to but not bonded to the active site — to liberate methane and the disulfide
CoM–S–S–CoB. The first and second coordination spheres of nickel in several MCR states are intractable,
which motivates us to synthesize tractable small molecules that recapitulate active-site features proposed for
these contentious states. Comparing data for models and MCR tells us how plausible these proposals are.
Our long-term goal is to synthesize high-fidelity models that help us understand how MCR makes and breaks
the C–H bonds in methane. Towards this goal, the objective of this project is to prepare, and spectroscopically
and chemically interrogate macrocyclic nickel complexes with very similar ligand environments to F430 in
different MCR states. The central hypothesis is that to mimic MCR spectroscopy a nickel complex needs a
high-fidelity first coordination sphere, while to mimic MCR function and cleave methane it further requires a
second-coordination-sphere radical. In preliminary work, we prepared and crystallized four-coordinate nickel
complexes of a readily tunable anionic macrocycle. Our density functional theory calculations predict that one
such complex should bind thiolate to mimic the first coordination sphere of F430 in the methane-cleaving step.
Further calculations predict that a related complex with a pendant thiyl radical near the thiolate is both plausible
and thermodynamically favored to cleave methane. The rationale is that tunable models will let us tease out
the motifs necessary for C–H activation. We will test our hypothesis by focusing on two specific aims. Aim 1:
Model the first coordination sphere of nickel in MCR to mimic spectroscopy and Aim 2: Model the second
coordination sphere of nickel in MCR to mimic function. Towards Aim 1 we will: (a) prepare and characterize
nickel complexes of anionic macrocycles, and (b) bind these complexes to water, thioether, thiolate, thiol,
methyl or hydride ligands. These ligands have been proposed to bind the MCR active site but evidence,
particularly for the last three ligands, is scarce, so our models will identify plausible first coordination spheres.
Towards Aim 2 we will: (a) further develop the nickel complexes to feature a thiolate and a proximal thiyl
radical, and (b) investigate the chemistry of this thiolate–thiyl species towards methane and other alkanes.
The macrocylic nickel complexes and their adducts will be the highest-fidelity synthetic models reported and
their activation of methane would be unprecedented for such nickel macrocycles. Overall, this work will
complement biochemical studies to fill in our mechanistic picture for MCR, a central metabolic enzyme."

Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) constitute the majority of RNAs present within the human cell, and are potent
regulators of cellular processes, including translation, splicing, and post-transcriptional messenger RNA (mRNA)
control. Like humans, viruses produce ncRNAs, whose functions are still largely unknown. Given that viruses
evolved to maximize the information contained within their small genomes, all viral ncRNAs are postulated to be
functional. Our lab studies the mechanisms by which small viral ncRNAs modulate host and viral
processes, the knowledge of which will contribute to the development of new approaches to treat human
disease. In the next five years, we will elucidate the roles of two distinct viral ncRNAs classes: small nuclear
RNAs (snRNAs) expressed by an oncogenic g-herpesvirus (Project 1), and a microRNA (miRNA) produced by
SARS-CoV-2, a virus that causes acute respiratory disease (Project 2).
 g-herpesviruses are DNA viruses, which during latency induce host cell transformation and oncogenesis.
The latent viral genes produce several proteins and multiple ncRNAs. During its latency, herpesvirus saimiri, a
classic g-herpesvirus, expresses seven snRNAs, known as HSURs. Unlike human snRNAs, HSURs were not
linked to mRNA splicing, but instead to regulating host RNA levels in the cytoplasm. Interestingly, our results
indicate that HSURs predominantly localize to the nucleus, where their roles remain unknown. Additionally, we
observe that HSURs selectively translocate host cytoplasmic RNA-binding proteins into the nucleus. In
Project 1, we will investigate the nuclear roles of viral snRNAs to explore unknown functions for host
RNA-binding proteins and to gain insights into g-herpesviral transformation.
 SARS-CoV-2, a large RNA virus, is the causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 and the source
of the current pandemic. We and others have recently discovered a miRNA expressed by SARS-CoV-2, named
CoV-miR-O7a, which downregulates host genes involved inter alia in interferon signaling. Our preliminary data
show that CoV-miR-O7a is abundantly present inside SARS-CoV-2 virions. We hypothesize that CoV-miR-O7a
(and perhaps other ncRNAs) are selectively incorporated into virions to allow for early manipulation of host gene
expression. In Project 2, we will investigate the mechanism and significance of viral miRNA incorporation
into nascent virions to understand as yet unknown aspects of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and to
describe the previously unexplored way in which viruses inhibit host antiviral responses.
 Our multidisciplinary approaches, combined with the flexibility of MIRA funding, will lead to the
establishment of a unique research program centered around understanding of small RNA biology in the context
of viral infection. In elucidating functions of small viral ncRNAs, this study will advance the fields of RNA biology
and virology. Such knowledge can lead to identification of novel targets for treatment of viral disease, including
virally-induced cancers."

Genome instability is generally deleterious to cell growth. Paradoxically, in cancer, it is associated with increased
drug resistance, metastasis and immune evasion; all of which contribute to poor patient prognosis. The broader
landscape of our research is to fully understand how the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway and mitotic
machinery work in concert to promote faithful genome stability. A major component of the DDR pathway is Ataxia
telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR) kinase. I previously discovered an unexpected, and novel DNA damage-
independent, role for ATR kinase after mitotic entry. This newly revealed role for ATR is essential for genome
stability. This unexpected role for ATR opened up many opportunities to understand cross-talk between the
pathways that regulate genomic stability and is foundational to my lab.
Our long-term goal is to make unique contributions by elucidating how the non-canonical roles of the proteins
that make up the DDR pathway ensure genome stability. Our five-year goal is to further our understanding of the
mechanisms by which ATR promotes genome stability outside of the DNA damage response pathway in both
mitosis (program 1) and interphase (program 2).
Our current understanding of the mitotic function of ATR is limited to our previous observations that ATR activates
promotes proper Aurora B activity. This leaves a large gap of knowledge as to how ATR promotes proper
chromosome segregation. We will explore the mitotic pathways that ATR regulates, focusing on putative direct
substrates that we have identified (program 1).
Additionally, our previous work uncovered two novel, DDR independent functions of ATR, which we aim to fully
explore in this proposal (program 2). (1) ATR directly phosphorylates lamin A/C in interphase. This has prompted
us to define the function of ATR on nuclear plasticity and nuclear envelope breakdown. (2) Basal ATR activity is
necessary for proper centromere identity throughout interphase. We will focus on how basal ATR activity
promotes proper centromere identity and function through its regulation of promyelocytic nuclear bodies.
We expect that these projects will yield critical information on the role of ATR in mitosis and how it and the DNA
damage response pathway promote faithful chromosome segregation independent of DNA damage and further
our understanding of the mechanism that promote genome stability."

Poor environmental conditions such as air pollution, and unsafe water and sanitation have been ranked among
the top risk factors for disability-adjusted years (DALYs) in children. The highest number of deaths per capita
attributable to environmental exposures have been observed in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) with the highest
disease burden noted among children. The overall goal of the proposed research is to harness data science
applications to establish the spatial variability in the impact of ambient PM2.5 exposure on children’s health in
SSA and further identify the explanatory and moderating factors. The overall goal of the project would be
achieved through the following specific aims: (1) Establish the spatial variability in the impact of ambient PM2.5
exposure on children’s health in SSA, and explore the effect modifying role of neighbourhood greenness and
nutrition, (2) Estimate ambient PM2.5 exposures at multi-temporal scales by integrating land use regression
(LUR) models, high-resolution ground monitoring data, and mobile monitoring data in Uganda and Ghana, and
(3) Identify area - (regional, district) and household-level factors that explain the spatial variability in ambient
PM2.5 – child health relationship and establish the temporal changes in these exposure risk profiles. The
proposed research seeks to create new knowledge and provide evidence on the potential of data science for
addressing children’s environmental health problems in SSA in alignment with the DSI-Africa program.
 For Aim 1, we will leverage data science tools to combine geospatial PM2.5 exposures estimated using
satellite remote sensing with data on child undernutrition, acute respiratory infections, and neonatal and infant
deaths assembled from several waves of Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster
Survey (MICS) data spanning several decades. We will use a spatial random coefficient model set in a Bayesian
framework to model the spatially varying relationship between ambient PM2.5 and the child health outcomes of
interest controlling for individual- and area-level confounders. For Aim 2, we would apply machine learning
techniques to develop a land use regression (LUR) model for Kampala and Accra leveraging mobile and fixed
monitoring data and compare the models between the two cities under the following data conditions; (1) using
only consistent data available in both cities and (2) using city-specific data to derive locally optimized models.
We will in addition evaluate transferability of the models from one city to another, and also, identify the most
important temporal and spatial predictors in both cities. For Aim 3, we will use Bayesian Profile Regression (BPR)
and leveraging the same datasets in Aim 1 to identify profile clusters that characterize high PM2.5 exposures
and determine which exposure profile clusters is associated with increase prevalence of adverse child health
outcomes. We would also explore the temporal changes in exposure profiles in the study countries.
 The findings of the proposed resaerch should help trigger investment in air pollution control as well as
policy action for addressing area and household poverty to help improve child health and survival in SSA."

The bacterial cell envelope is a complex and dynamic multilayered structure essential for cell growth and division.
The structural layer of the envelope, known as the cell wall or peptidoglycan (PG), determines cell shape and is
essential for survival because it protects bacteria from osmotic lysis. The action of PG synthases, which add new
material for the enlargement of the cell wall, and PG hydrolases, which create space for expansion of the PG
mesh-like structure, are both necessary for growth. Some of our most powerful and successful antibiotics target
PG synthases and derive their efficacy from not only inhibiting cell wall assembly, but also by causing cell lysis
through the active destruction of the cell wall by PG hydrolases. Because of their potential to cause cell lysis, it
has long been appreciated that bacteria must possess robust mechanisms to control when and where PG
hydrolases are activated. However, the molecular details underlying these regulatory processes are lacking.
Research in my laboratory focuses on uncovering and characterizing regulatory systems controlling PG
hydrolase activity during normal growth, and how antibiotics short-circuit this regulation to trigger cell lysis. Using
the human respiratory pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae as a model organism, we found that PG hydrolases
are controlled by two cell envelope polymers known as teichoic acids (TAs): membrane-linked lipoteichoic acids
(LTAs) and cell wall-anchored teichoic acids (WTAs). Characterization of novel enzymes involved in TA
synthesis and remodeling revealed that cell-wall targeting antibiotics hyperactivate PG hydrolases by disrupting
the normal mechanisms that balance the levels of WTAs and LTAs in the cell envelope. Current studies in my
laboratory indicate that the levels of TAs are controlled by a complex regulatory network involving post-
translational modifications and targeted proteolysis. We also discovered that the modulation of the TA levels in
the cell envelope has significant impacts on cell morphology, growth, and tolerance to antibiotics. However, many
aspects of this regulation and synthesis and remodeling pathways remain unknown. Therefore, the goals of this
proposal are to (i) identify signals and pathways that modulate LTA biogenesis and characterize how antibiotics
subvert them; (ii) determine the physiological roles and regulation of a widely-conserved protease and
characterize how antibiotics hyperactivate its activity to disrupt LTA biogenesis; (iii) characterize the regulation
of a novel WTA remodeling enzyme, and uncover how S. pneumoniae uses WTA levels to control lysis and
promote growth. The results generated by this research will provide fundamental insights into broadly relevant
principles for envelope assembly and maintenance in S. pneumoniae and related bacteria. S. pneumoniae has
become an alarming multidrug-resistant health threat. Therefore, novel antibiotics that target S. pneumoniae are
critically needed. The studies proposed here will reveal general mechanisms by which bacteria remodel their
envelopes to survive antibiotic exposure and uncover new targets for therapeutic intervention."

The Optical Instrumentation Core will develop, implement, support, integrate, and improve optical and
peripheral instrumentation, ensuring that our researchers have the best available technology. The overall aim
of this U19 collaboration is to elucidate how working memory and decision-making are supported by interacting
neurons and brain regions. To achieve this goal, our research projects require methods for large-scale
recording and perturbation of neural activity. These methods depend on optical instrumentation, such as
multi-photon microscopes, laser-based optogenetic perturbation systems, and widefield microscopy. Our
experiments also rely on equipment that generates and controls, in real time, the virtual-reality environment in
which the animals perform tasks. To take full advantage of the new technologies in the BRAIN Initiative, we will
innovate and upgrade instrumentation and methods as the cutting edge of the field moves forward.
 The core’s first aim will be to implement, support, and improve two-photon and three-photon
microscopes, which are used for calcium imaging and integrated with our mouse behavioral setups. We will
maintain four mid-range field of view, two-photon microscopes, along with our mesoscope, which can image
from two or more widely separated regions or layers at a high effective rate. This mesoscope is our core
instrument for studying neural interactions between non-adjacent regions. We will also implement a recently
developed technique that greatly increases the number of neurons simultaneously recorded. Finally, we will
maintain and upgrade our three-photon microscope, used to image below cortex and in deep areas, and also
to provide vasculature imaging for registering calcium imaging with electron microscopy.
 The second aim will be to support and improve widefield-imaging instrumentation. We will maintain a
custom widefield microscope based on a back-to-back objective system for use with our mouse virtual-reality
systems and integrate it into new behavioral systems as needed. This instrument is used to map boundaries of
visual areas and the flow of neural activity via calcium imaging at the mesoscopic scale.
 The third aim will be to implement, support, and improve our combined optogenetic and imaging
instrumentation. We built an instrument for simultaneous two-photon imaging and single-cell, two-photon
photostimulation. In addition, we are redesigning an instrument we developed that combines cellular-resolution
optogenetic perturbation of multiple cells simultaneously with large-scale calcium imaging of neural
populations, which will be used to study how an animal's behavior is affected by changes in the sequences of
neural activation during behavioral tasks. In summary, the Optical Instrumentation Core will provide seamless
support for microscopy and virtual-reality experiments within all the research projects. More broadly, we expect
that widespread availability of our pioneering and standardized methods for visualizing neural activity and for
rodent experiments in virtual reality will be highly valuable to the neuroscience community."

Oxytocin is a peptide hormone synthesized and released from the hypothalamus for reproduction, maternal care,
and social behavior, as well as various ‘non-social’ aspects of internal state and physiological processes.
Although sometimes referred to as a ‘trust’ hormone, a growing body of evidence across species and brain areas
indicates that oxytocin can increase social salience, i.e., amplifying or enabling selective attention towards
certain social stimuli, such as the sound of a crying infant or the presence of a threatening or high-status
individual. Oxytocin is believed to have therapeutic potential, and delivery of oxytocin into the central nervous
system promises to improve social deficits in various mental disorders, such as autism. Despite the enthusiasm
for oxytocin, contradictory results in the efficacy of oxytocin in improving human social behaviors have been
reported. Such inconsistency in literature is likely due to our poor understanding of complexity of oxytocin action,
which likely varies with behavioral state, experience and brain structures. We believe that a better understanding
of the endogenous action of oxytocin is the key to unleash the therapeutic potential of this highly evolutionary
conserved neuropeptide. Advancing our understanding requires cross-level and comparative inter-disciplinary
studies by an group of investigators with overlapping interests and the technical capability to analyze oxytocin
signaling across molecular, physiological, systems behavioral and levels. This includes multi-animal interactions,
as many mental disorders are impactful on social behavior, over the lifespan and throughout the brain.

social interactions within a specific context or behavioral environment. Our team will join forces to tackle the
oxytocin system from both the source (oxytocin neurons) and the receiving ends (oxytocin receptor-expressing

adult social hierarchy, extending to collective parenting to ensure the survival of offspring as one key advantage
of a stable social ecosystem. For Overall Aim 2, Project 3 dives into detailed cellular, synaptic and microcircuit
mechanisms that mediate the oxytocin actions. In Overall Aim 3, Project 4 combines knowledge and techniques
developed from Projects 1, 2, and 3 to develop methods for specific circuit perturbations to affect socio-spatial

and post-acute phases of stroke, many individuals suffer chronic deficits and have few options for
continued treatment. A number of low-cost, alternative treatments are now being tested for their
usefulness in treating neuropsychological deficits in chronic stroke patients. One of the best studied of
these treatments is Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), which involves an 8-week course led
by a trained instructor. MBSR teaches individuals strategies for coping with their injury, such as
meditation, breathing techniques, and yoga. A handful of preliminary studies have shown that MBSR is
effective in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression in stroke patients, as well as enhancing
performance on cognitive tasks. However, only a single randomized controlled trial of MBSR in stroke
has been published to date, and that study suffered from a number of weaknesses such as the lack of
an active control group. Moreover, no previous study has assessed the usefulness of MBSR for stroke
in a Veteran population. Therefore, the current study proposes to undertake a rigorous, randomized
controlled trial of MBSR in Veterans with a history of stroke, using an active control group, blinded
examiners, and a 6-month follow-up session to determine whether the benefits of MBSR are long-lasting.
For the study, 120 Veterans with a history of chronic stroke will be recruited: 60 participants will be
randomly assigned to the MBSR intervention, and 60 participants will be assigned to a Brain Health class
that is matched to the MBSR intervention with respect to the instructor, number of hours of instruction,
homework activities, and class size. A blinded examiner will complete a neuropsychological assessment
of patients’ emotional and cognitive status at three time points: 1) prior to the intervention, 2) following
the intervention, and 3) six months later. Evaluation of the MBSR intervention will test for improvements
in anxiety and depressive symptomatology following the intervention, relative to the Brain Health group,
as well as improvements on a cognitive test battery. It is predicted that improvements associated with
the MBSR intervention will still be present at the 6-month follow-up assessment as well. The final

ability to benefit from MBSR. Previous research has suggested that left prefrontal cortex plays a critical
role underlying the effects of MBSR. Thus, it is predicted that involvement of this brain region will
modulate the observed effects. Such information could be used to target those Veterans who can most

10705130,"Over 80,000 Veterans with Parkinson’s disease (PD) currently obtain their medical care within the VA
Healthcare System, and the number of Veterans with PD is expected to increase considerably in the near
future. Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) is severely compromised in those with PD and worsens as the
disease progresses. Non-motor symptoms, particularly impaired cognition and mood (anxiety and
depression), contribute to poor and worsening of HRQoL in PD. Therefore, interventions that target these
symptoms and improve HRQoL are critically needed.
 Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR) in a non-pharmacological intervention that has been
shown to improve HRQoL, mood, and cognition in older adults with and without neurological conditions.
Although preliminary evidence supports MBSR as a promising intervention for PD, a systematic,
comprehensive randomized controlled trial (RCT) of MBSR has yet to be conducted in this population.
Moreover, it is unknown if immediate preliminary benefits are maintained over time. As PD is a
neurodegenerative disorder, non-transient benefits are of paramount importance in the treatment of this
chronic, disabling disease. Results from our pilot trial (n = 20) demonstrated that PD participants who
completed an 8-week MBSR program (n = 8) evidenced an improvement in overall HRQoL (d’ = 1.1), cognition
(d’ = 1.6), and mood (anxiety; d’ = 1.1), compared to PD participants in an 8-week active control condition
(Psychoeducation/Supportive Care; n = 12); the latter of whom experienced a worsening of symptoms. These
findings provide compelling preliminary evidence of MBSR efficacy for PD, and strongly underscore the need
for adequate treatment of PD-related non-motor symptoms with empirically-validated interventions.
 The overall aim of this longitudinal RCT is to determine the efficacy of MBSR to improve HRQoL,
cognition, and mood, as well as to determine the longevity of the treatment response in individuals with PD.
We hypothesize that HRQoL, cognition (particularly executive function), and mood (particularly anxiety)
symptoms (will improve in PD participants following eight weeks of MBSR compared to PD participants
randomized to an eight-week active Psychoeducation control condition. We further hypothesize that benefits
of MBSR treatment will be evident at the 6- and 12-month assessments, such that those completing the MBSR
group will demonstrate better HRQoL, cognition, and mood relative to those PD patients who completed the
Psychoeducation/Supportive Care (PSC) group. Potential mediators/moderators of the treatment response
will be examined in exploratory hypotheses. Eighty-eight non-demented individuals with PD will be recruited
and enrolled in the proposed study. Over-recruitment by 10% will be instituted to account for subject attrition
or unusable data, and to ensure an adequately-powered sample size of 80 (40 per group). Participants will
be randomized into either eight of weeks of MBSR (n = 44) or eight weeks of PSC (n = 44). All participants
will be administered a battery of neuropsychological tests to measure HRQoL, cognition (e.g., executive
function, attention, memory), and mood (i.e., anxiety, depression, and apathy), as well as motor symptoms,
disease severity, and mindfulness engagement/practice. Tests will be administered at baseline, 8 weeks
(post-treatment), and 6- and 12-months (follow-up assessments) by an examiner blinded to group
assignment. Data will be primarily analyzed using linear and multivariable random effects modeling.
 Findings from this study will provide critical information regarding the efficacy of MBSR for HRQoL,
cognition, and mood in PD. Furthermore, results will provide essential data regarding the long-term benefits
of MBSR in PD, and elucidate potential mediators/moderators of treatment response. Ultimately, this study
will contribute to the VA mission by establishing an empirically-validated intervention for Veterans and civilians
with PD that can be easily and widely implemented and disseminated throughout the VA Healthcare System."
10874433,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Each year, 1 in 6 children are diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental disorder such as autism spectrum disorder,
intellectual disability, or epilepsy. Such disorders severely impact the emotional, social, physical, and economic
wellbeing of patients and their caregivers, and a poor understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of these
disorders has slowed the discovery of effective therapies. There is evidence, however, that neurodevelopmental
disorders as a class are associated with selective dysfunction of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons in the
cerebral cortex.
Dravet Syndrome, caused by pathogenic variants in the SCN1A gene encoding the Nav1.1 voltage-gated sodium
channel a subunit, is a canonical example of a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by interneuron dysfunction,
as interneurons in the neocortex preferentially rely on Nav1.1 for action potential generation and propagation.
Importantly, cerebral cortical interneurons are a functionally heterogenous population; therefore, understanding
the contribution of different classes of interneurons to microcircuit function in normal brain, and dysfunction in
the setting of pathology, is essential for further elucidating the mechanisms of neurodevelopmental disorders.
In this proposal, I will determine the function or dysfunction of the least studied major population of neocortical
interneurons, those expressing Neuron-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (Ndnf), within cerebral cortical microcircuits
in Dravet Syndrome. These cells are enriched in layer 1 of neocortex, where they are thought to play a role in
sensory processing and regulating inhibitory tone in the cortex. Using a clinically-relevant and well-characterized
mouse model of Dravet Syndrome, I will first establish the electrophysiologic, synaptic, and morphologic
properties of Ndnf-expressing interneurons in Scn1a+/- mice relative to wild-type mice in vitro (Aim 1). I will then
determine the behavior of these cells within cortical microcircuits in Scn1a+/- mice relative to wild-type in vivo
using multiphoton imaging and optogenetic approaches (Aim 2). This proposal will not only provide novel data
on an understudied interneuron subtype, both in health and disease, but also provide training in a suite of
advanced electrophysiologic and optical techniques that will serve to train the applicant towards a future career
as a physician-scientist studying circuit dysfunction in neurological disorders and development of new therapies
and cures."
10867325,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by progressive increase of pulmonary vascular
resistance and obliterative vascular remodeling that causes right heart failure and premature death.
Given the underlying molecular mechanisms of obliterative vascular remodeling remain enigmatic,
current therapies have not targeted the fundamental disease modifying mechanisms and hence only
resulted in a modest improvement in the morbidity and mortality. We have recently shown that Egln1Tie2Cre
mice exhibit unprecedented spontaneous severe PAH and obliterative pulmonary vascular remodeling
including neointima formation, and vascular occlusion as seen in patients with idiopathic PAH (IPAH) and
PHD2 expression is diminished in ECs of occlusive pulmonary vessels of IPAH patients. This renewal
proposal is based on our fundamental new observations that 1) genetic depletion of macrophages (Mφ)
with the MaFIA mice inhibited obliterative vascular remodeling and attenuated PAH in Egln1Tie2Cre/MaFIA
mice; 2) Single cell RNA sequencing analysis identified an emerging subpopulation of PAH-specific
progenitor Mφ in Egln1Tie2Cre lungs; 3) CD206+ Mφ accumulated in the vascular lesions of Egln1Tie2Cre
lungs expressed abundantly angiogenic factors inducing PASMC proliferation; 4) genetic disruption of
the GPCR-dependent p110γ isoform of PI3K in Egln1Tie2Cre mice inhibited the production of these factors
and obliterative vascular remodeling. Thus, we hypothesize that marked accumulation of CD206+ Mφ
derived from progenitor Mφ in pulmonary vascular lesions induces obliterative pulmonary vascular
remodeling and severe PAH through p110γPI3K-dependent induction of pro-PAH factors via EC-Mφ
interaction. Studies in Aim 1 will determine the fundamental role of CD206+ Mφ subpopulation in
promoting obliterative pulmonary vascular remodeling and severe PAH. We will employ single cell RNA
sequencing, lineage tracing and genetic depletion approaches to determine the causal role of CD206+
Mφ and pMφ in mediating obliterative pulmonary vascular remodeling. In Aim 2, we will delineate the
molecular basis of CD206+ Mφ in mediating obliterative pulmonary vascular remolding and explore the
translational potential of targeting these molecular mechanisms for treatment of PAH. The molecular
mechanisms identified in mouse models will be validated in SuHx PAH rats. The clinical relevance will
also be determined with PASMCs and lung tissues of IPAH patients. We expect that the proposed studies
have significant translational potential by delineating the molecular and cellular mechanisms of
obliterative vascular remodeling, identifying druggable targets, and exploring novel pharmacological
agents that can pharmacologically inhibit/reverse vascular remodeling for the prevention and treatment
of PAH in patients."
10893644,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The proposed multi-site clinical trial will fill a critical unmet need for therapeutic development in semantic
variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA), a syndrome that is over 85% predictive of frontotemporal lobar
degeneration with mislocalization of TDP-43 on autopsy (FTLD-TDP). We will thereby address the larger
critical unmet need for therapeutic development in the greater spectrum of TDP-43 pathology, which is present
in up to 20% of suspected Alzheimer's disease and over half of frontotemporal dementia. We hypothesize that
microglial myeloperoxidase (MPO), an enzyme responsible for generation of microglial oxidative species, is a
key therapeutic target in the pathogenesis of FTLD with TDP-4 mislocalization. We will therefore conduct a
phase 1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential cohort, dose-ranging, tolerability, and
preliminary pharmacodynamic study of two doses of Verdiperstat (BHV-3241), an orally administered MPO
inhibitor, in patients with svPPA. As the first multi-site clinical trial focused on svPPA, this project will establish
the crucial organizational infrastructure to conduct future multicenter trials in this cohort, while leveraging
existing clinical expertise and patient recruitment infrastructure from the large NIH-funded ARTFL-LEFFTDS
Longitudinal Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (ALLFTD) multisite clinical research consortium. In order to
establish the appropriateness of follow-up phase 2 trials, we will determine the safety and tolerability (Aim 1)
and the pharmacokinetics (in blood and CSF) (Aim 2) of 300mg (low dose) and 600mg (high dose) BHV-324,
orally administered twice daily (BID) for 24 weeks in patients with svPPA due to underlying FTLD-TDP. N=55
Participants will be randomized overall to placebo (N=15), low dose (N=10), and high dose (N=30) BHV-3241
respectively. Given the lack of established pharmacodynamic measures of drug efficacy in FTLD, we will also
explore the effects of BHV-3241 on peripheral MPO activity, fluid and imaging biomarkers of
neurodegeneration, unbiased CSF proteomics, and clinical status in FTLD-TDP (Aim 3). Our proposed
discovery and longitudinal characterization of candidate measures of svPPA biological and clinical severity will
provide essential information, informing the design of future efficacy trials exploring BHV-3241 and other
potential therapies in svPPA and the larger spectrum of FTLD-TDP."
10895543,"Priming of antitumor immunity relies on a specialized subset of conventional Dendritic Cells (cDC1s), CD103+
DCs, that have unique capabilities of trafficking tumor antigens to lymph nodes for cross-presentation. The critical
role of cDC1s in cancer immune surveillance make them highly coveted targets for immunotherapy; however,
their scarcity, the difficulty of specifically engaging DCs, and the suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME)
pose severe obstacles. We are investigating immunotherapy with attenuated, recombinant poliovirus (PV),
PVSRIPO, because of the naturally evolved tropism of PV for DCs. In humans or chimpanzees, oral PV infection
leads to remarkably effective targeting of CD11c+DCs in peripheral (gastrointestinal) and lymphoid tissues.
PVSRIPO, engineered with an IRES from human rhinovirus type 2, lacks cytopathogenicity in normal cells, eg.
DCs. Rather, DC infection yields ‘sustained’ type-I interferon (IFN) responses elicited by specific viral dsRNA
patterns that engage the PV pattern recognition receptor (PRR) MDA5. Mechanistic investigations of PVSRIPO
treatment in ex vivo human tumor slices revealed that: (i) the main outcome is sustained type-I IFN release from
myeloid cell subsets in the non-malignant TME; (ii) PVSRIPO’s unique innate imprint provides optimal DC
activation stimuli for CD4+T cell TH1-polarization and CD8+T cell priming; (iii) PVSRIPO’s ‘PRR-contextualized’
IFN response induces polyfunctional GzmB+, IFNg+, T-bet+ antitumor CD8+T cells that control tumor growth after
adoptive transfer. We reported very promising Ph1 clinical trial results with PVSRIPO in challenging
indications: recurrent glioblastoma and recurrent, nonresectable melanoma. Our premise is that PVSRIPO
therapy recruits cDC1s, leads to local infection of these cells, induces migration to lymph nodes/spleen,
and stimulates tumor antigen cross-presentation via the intrinsic innate inflammatory signature it elicits.
We propose mechanistic and translational studies to gain insight into targeting of DCs by PVSRIPO, the way
sublethal infection of distinct myeloid subsets activates tumor antigen cross-presentation, and rational means of
enhancing DC engagement by intranodal virus administration. We propose the following Specific Aims: (1)
Unravel mechanisms of cDC1 recruitment, activation, and lymph node migration upon PVSRIPO infection of the
TME. (2) Determine the mononuclear phagocyte compartment(s) that mediate PVSRIPO antitumor effects; test
the roles of T cell-intrinsic IFN signaling and chemotaxis. (3) Reinforce cDC1 engagement by perinodal delivery
or upon infection of the PVSRIPO-reactive glioma myeloid infiltrate.
Significance: these studies explore a unique opportunity for effectively engaging CD103+DCs in tumor antigen
cross-presentation and CD8+T cell priming, based on the natural tropism for DCs and unique innate inflammatory
imprint of PVSRIPO. The long-term objective of this research is to provide means for re-instating effective cancer
immune surveillance in patients by overcoming tumor-associated deficits in DC function and CD8+T cell priming."
10805456,"Project Summary - Abstract
 The cochlear synapses of auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) degenerate before the sensory cells in both noise-
induced and age-related hearing loss, leaving may inner hair cells (IHCs) partially disconnected from the brain.
Although this synaptopathy has minimal effects on threshold sensitivity, it compromises hearing performance
on complex auditory tasks and may be a major risk factor for tinnitus and hyperacusis. We have shown, in
mouse, that augmenting cochlear levels of neurotrophin-3 (NT3) by local delivery, or by transgenic or virally
driven overexpression, can rescue IHC synapses after noise and prevent their loss in the aging ear. We have
also shown that post-noise IHC synapse regeneration occurs spontaneously in guinea pig, but not the mouse.
Here, we combine the resources of the Liberman and Corfas laboratories to apply a range of ultrastructural,
neurophysiological and molecular techniques to further probe the mechanisms and dynamics of synaptopathy,
characterize its functional effects, validate the minimally invasive tests used to assess it in humans, probe the
role of NT3 signaling as the key determinant of synaptopathy, and further refine translational approaches to
reverse and/or prevent synaptopathy after noise or in aging.
 Specifically, in Aim 1, we use FIB-SEM and machine learning to automate serial-section ultrastructural
analysis of the post-exposure damage and recovery of the IHC afferent innervation in mature mice vs. guinea
pigs, to shed light on the reasons for the profound differences in regenerative capacity in the two species. In
Aim 2, we combine population studies of single ANFs with intracellular labeling in synaptopathic guinea pigs at
various stages of post-exposure recovery to a) characterize the extent to which the recovered synaptic counts
reflect recovered function and b) to understand the contributions of different fiber populations to the non-
invasive metrics of ANF function used in human studies of synaptopathy. In Aim 3, we test the hypothesized
pivotal role of NT3 in the development and rescue of age- and noise-induced synaptopathy by a) determining if
NT3 expression levels are upregulated by noise in guinea pigs but not in mice, and b) if drug-mediated
blockade of cochlear NT3 receptors prevents the spontaneous post-exposure recovery of synapses in guinea
pig. In Aim 4, we continue our refinement of gene-therapy approaches to the treatment of synaptopathy using
an IHC-specific promoter in an AAV viral capsid to drive prolonged NT3 overexpression a) after noise and b) in
an aging mouse model. Together these Aims will deepen our understanding of, and treatments for, this major
contributor to the impairments of sensorineural hearing loss."
10923821,"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a particularly lethal form of cancer that kills over 40,000 Americans
every year. PDAC is most often diagnosed when disease is advanced, with metastases that lead to death.
Patient outcomes are further negatively-impacted by a typical poor response to currently-available treatments.
It is thus critical to develop a stronger understanding of the processes which lead to PDAC development and
metastasis, as well as to determine novel, more-efficacious targets for therapies. Low-level, constitutive
endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-mitochondria transfer of calcium is required for optimal bioenergetics and
cancer-cell survival. We hypothesize that this pathway contributes to pancreatic cancer development,
metastasis, and tumor maintenance, and may therefore present a viable anticancer target. The ER-localized
IP3R calcium-release ion channel and the mitochondrial calcium-uniporter ion channel, MCU, mediate calcium
transfer between the two organelles at membrane-contact sites. However, it has been impossible to target this
pathway in vivo because of the lack of selective, cell-permeable pharmacological agents against these ion
channels. We therefore propose to examine the role of ER-to-mitochondria calcium transfer in PDAC
development, metastasis, and tumor maintenance through the use of novel animal and cell-culture models. We
will genetically delete MCU during early development in a murine genetic-model of PDAC, the KPCY mouse, to
observe the role of this protein in tumor development. In addition, we will use tumor cells as well as genetically-
modified cells using Cre/lox and CRISPR/Cas9 systems, as well as patient-derived cell lines and the
established human PDAC cell line, Panc-1. We will assay proliferation, cellular bioenergetics, oxygen
consumption rates, and mitochondrial calcium homeostasis, using biochemical, cell biological and biophysical
approaches, including electrophysiology, live-cell imaging and fluorimetry, to define the role of ER-to-
mitochondria calcium transfer in these processes. To determine the role of MCU in metastasis, we will quantify
metastasis in the KPCY model using the sensitive YFP-reporter gene, and we will use an in vivo tail-vein
metastasis model with genetically-modified Panc-1 cells expressing luciferase in NOD/SCID mice, as well as in
vitro transwell-invasion and gel-degradation assays, and biochemical and morphological assessment of
metastasis-associated markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. To observe the role of ER-to-
mitochondria calcium transfer in tumor maintenance and thus its therapeutic potential for more advanced
disease, we will use an inducible CRISPR/Cas9 cell-culture model of murine PDAC in vitro and an in vivo
inducible orthotopic model to observe the effects of acute MCU ablation in already-growing tumors and cells as
a method to simulate profound pharmacological inhibition. These studies will elucidate the role of ER-to-
mitochondria calcium transfer in PDAC development, metastasis, and maintenance, and they may inform
future development of novel therapeutic targets in PDAC, potentially saving lives."

 This application proposing the CHIcago Center for Accelerating nextGen Omics, deep phenotyping, and
data science in Heart Failure (CHICAGO-HF) is in response to the RFA “HeartShare: Next-Generation
Phenomics to Define Heart Failure Subtypes and Treatment Targets-Clinical Centers.” Heart failure with
preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is increasing in
prevalence. No effective disease-modifying therapies exist for patients with HFpEF, largely due to the
substantial heterogeneity among patients with HFpEF for whom the current “one-size-fits-all” treatment
paradigm is failing. A large-scale, multicenter observational study to conduct deep phenotyping in patients with
HFpEF is a critical next step to advance our understanding of HFpEF pathophysiology and shift our clinical and
research paradigm in HFpEF towards a precision medicine approach. We propose three central elements that
are critical to address to comprehensively phenotype patients across the spectrum of HFpEF. First, direct
phenotyping of the myocardium, using tools such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and endomyocardial
biopsy, is necessary to elucidate the intrinsic myocardial biology of HFpEF. Second, detailed phenotyping of
the complex interplay of extra-cardiac comorbidities is needed to better understand the systemic nature of
HFpEF. Third, a representative sample of HFpEF patients with diversity across sex, race/ethnicity, geography,
and socioeconomic status needs to be included in phenotyping efforts to prevent widening of well-documented
disparities in HFpEF. The proposed Clinical Center, CHICAGO-HF, led by Northwestern, is uniquely qualified
to participate in all aspects of the HeartShare Network and to substantially enhance the Network’s goals. In our
application, we demonstrate key prior experiences, which include: (1) development of the world’s first
dedicated clinical program in HFpEF; (2) recruitment of large numbers of patients with HFpEF into multicenter
observational studies and trials; and (3) participation as a Field Center for NHLBI-funded cohorts. Our well-
resourced multi-disciplinary investigative team has expertise in epidemiology, informatics, deep phenotyping,
and artificial intelligence. We will leverage our experiences with our robust electronic health record
infrastructure to efficiently collect, harmonize and share retrospective and prospective data on a large number
of diverse patients with HFpEF and age- and sex-matched controls (HF with reduced and mid-range EF and
healthy controls). We will prospectively recruit at least 250 patients within the study timeline with community
partners across Chicago (e.g. Federally Qualified Health Centers). In addition, our unique expertise in
innovative MRI techniques and data analytics can strengthen the Network and will enable testing of significant
and innovative hypotheses to define unique phenotypes, elucidate distinct endotypes that represent underlying
pathobiology, and identify novel targeted therapeutics for HFpEF. CHICAGO-HF is ideally suited to serve as a
Clinical Center and contribute to the Network’s long-term mission to equitably improve HFpEF outcomes."

Perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMAD), defined as depression and anxiety during pregnancy or up to 1
year postpartum, affect 10-20% of pregnant and postpartum women, with elevated burden in low- and middle-
income countries (LMICs, >20%) and among women living with HIV (WLWH, >25%). Meeting the need for PMAD
treatment among WLWH in LMICs requires integration of evidence-based interventions (EBIs) into routine
antenatal and prevention of mother to child HIV transmission (PMTCT) services.
In Kenya, such efforts have been prioritized in national mental health policy strategy, but their delivery has been
limited by lack of provider training and poor linkage across provider cadres (e.g., primary care and mental health
providers). There is a need for development and testing of tailored interventions that strengthen workforce
capacity and facilitate linkage across provider cadres, as well as implementation strategies to facilitate high-
quality intervention delivery.
We have identified three EBIs to promote perinatal mental health: (1) universal mental health screening, (2) the
Problem Management Plus (PM+) counseling intervention for women experiencing PMAD, and (3) telepsychiatry
for women with severe symptoms or no response to PM+. We propose to combine these interventions in a
stepped care model, named the Integrated Perinatal Mental Health program (IPMH), and develop
implementation strategies to support its integration into routine PMTCT care in Kenya. We will then
evaluate IPMH’s effectiveness and implementation outcomes in a Hybrid Type II cluster-randomized trial
in 20 healthcare facilities in Western Kenya, the region with the highest HIV prevalence in the country.
In Aim 1, we will use participatory design to optimize and adapt IPMH and develop implementation strategies.
In Aim 2, we will determine the effect of IPMH and its implementation strategies on mental health, HIV care, and
pregnancy outcomes among WLWH from pregnancy to 6 months postpartum. In Aim 3, we will determine effect
of IPMH and its implementation strategies on service delivery and implementation outcomes, and identify
multilevel drivers of successful implementation.
We hypothesize that provision of the IPMH stepped care intervention in routine PMTCT services, along with
tailored implementation strategies, will (1) lead to lower depression and anxiety symptoms, lower adverse
pregnancy outcomes, and better quality of life; and (2) increase penetration and equity of care provision to
WLWH experiencing PMAD.
IPMH has potential to address a critical gap in treatment of PMAD among WLWH in resource-limited settings.
Completion of these aims will generate rigorous data on both IPMH’s effectiveness and the
implementation strategies for high quality and sustainable delivery of a ready-to-scale intervention."
10907649,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Antibiotic use is common among women of reproductive potential, including lactating women. However, little is
known about the transmission and pharmacokinetics of specific antibiotics in human milk, nor the effects of
antibiotic treatment on milk composition and quality including nutritional components, oligosaccharide profile,
and the microbiome. Establishment of the infant gut microbiome is dependent on a dynamic maternal–infant
microbiota exchange during early life, which is largely facilitated via breastfeeding. It is thus critical to better
understand the impact of specific antibiotics on milk composition. Furthermore, it is essential to determine how
maternal antibiotic use may impact infant outcomes, including growth, development, and immune response.
 Building on the infrastructure of the University of California San Diego Human Milk Research Biorepository, a
highly qualified, multidisciplinary research team will prospectively enroll and interview 480 maternal/infant pairs
at baseline, collect milk, skin, and stool samples, and monitor ongoing breastfeeding practices and maternal use
of one of four commonly used antibiotics over time. From these, we will subsequently identify 40 maternal/infant
pairs with maternal uptake of target antibiotic treatment, 40 matched maternal/infant pairs without antibiotic
exposure, and 20 non-lactating maternal/infant pairs with maternal uptake of a target antibiotic treatment. From
these 100 pairs, we will collect additional home and maternal and infant biomarkers of exposure at 3 timepoints
corresponding to antibiotic initiation, mid-course, and end-course, collect interview and medical record data, and
obtain a questionnaire assessment of infant development at 12 months post-partum. Data will be used to
determine the amount and pharmacokinetics of target antibiotics in breast milk samples and to test the central
hypotheses that (1) milk composition, oligosaccharide, and microbiome profiles will differ between groups by
antibiotic treatment status; (2) microbiome and metabolomic measures will differ in treated and untreated
breastfeeding groups; and (3) antibiotics will be detectable in the stool, skin, and home environment swabs of
mothers who are treated with antibiotics but are not breastfeeding. We will also explore the impact on maternal
antibiotic use on infant growth and development.
 Findings of this study will fill a critical gap in knowledge regarding the presence of commonly used antibiotics
in breast milk and the effects of antibiotic treatment on both breast milk composition and quality as well as short-
and long-term infant outcomes, including growth, development, gut health, and immune response. This will
inform evidence-based development of specific guidance on antibiotic use during lactation and help support
advice provided by healthcare providers to breastfeeding women."
10925180,"PROJECT SUMMARY: TRAINING AND EDUCATION PROGRAM
 While minority faculty in the clinical and translational sector may provide an innovative perspective from
which we identify problems disproportionately plaguing populations of color, they often lack the research
capacity needed to both rigorously evaluate the causal predictors of these problems and identify mechanistic
modes of intervention for the elimination of health disparities. Moreover, minority investigators encounter major
barriers to successful competition for federal research funding, which include but are not limited to: inadequate
research training, a lack of opportunities for professional development, insufficient mentorship, and inadequate
support for research focused on minority populations (Shavers, 2005).
 Thus, in response to PAR-18-911, our goal is to partner with Hampton University (HU) faculty in order
to provide hybrid training and education to increase HU research capacity in the area of cancer genomics and
health disparities, while also providing a rigorous curriculum in introductory and advanced biostatistics and
data science, clinical genome science, epidemiology, community-engaged research, health disparities
research, and clinical research methods. The curriculum will be administered through online asynchronous and
synchronous lectures coupled with intensive on-site training sessions in Years 2 through 4 of the proposed
four-year partnership. Our objectives are to: 1) successfully implement the online cancer genomics research
training and education program; 2) design and successfully implement the on-site research training education
program; and 3) conduct a rigorous evaluation of the impact of the proposed training and education program
on building research capacity and increasing research engagement and productivity. Additionally, HU will be
providing extensive insight and guidance to help foster a culture of inclusion, diversity, and equity among
members of the ISMMS research workforce through a series of in-person and virtual lectures.
 In summary, we are confident that our proposed, comprehensive, online and on-site training and
education program will increase the competitive success of federal grant submissions by HU faculty for cancer
health disparities genomics research projects, while also providing them with an optimal skill-set that they can
disseminate to the larger HU community of faculty and students."

Animal Structure and Function Core
The Animal Structure and Function Core provides centralized space for state-of-the-art structural and
functional animal testing with a dedicated animal care technician to conduct the testing and to train
investigators and their staff on the use of the new equipment. The number of faculty in the Department of
Ophthalmology conducting animal structure and functional testing has grown rapidly in recent years. With
this critical mass of investigators, there are compelling financial and logistical reasons to minimize the
number of animals in scientific studies. The use of ocular imaging methods that enable longitudinal
observations in a living animal can greatly reduce the need to sacrifice animals at different time points in an
experiment. It also provides invaluable information that is used to evaluate the accuracy of animal models of
human eye diseases. In addition, the high cost of retinal imaging devices has made it prohibitively
expensive for individual scientist to purchase, therefore limiting the scope of their scientific
investigations. This core will provide a range of imaging and functioning testing services including the
Phoenix Micron III and Phoenix Micron IV Animal Imaging System with multifocal ERG and ERG setup, new
Celeris animal ERG system, Spectralis SDOCT system for spectral domain optical coherence tomography
studies and PacScan 300 A-scanner for measuring axial length, anterior chamber depth and lens thickness,
ultrasound imaging allowing our researchers to make most efficient use of their time and resources."
10872258,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) comprise a spectrum of devastating
and fatal neurodegenerative diseases. While over 20 genetic loci have been linked to ALS and FTD, about
90% of ALS cases are sporadic in nature. Recent studies have identified alterations in the nuclear pore
complex (NPC) and nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) as a prominent pathomechanism underlying familial
and sporadic ALS. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these pathologic disruptions remain largely
unknown. Our recent studies have established that there is a reproducible and robust reduction of eight
nucleoporins (Nups) from the NPC in C9orf72 iPSN and postmortem patient neuronal nuclei. Recent work
suggests that the ESCRT-III pathway plays a fundamental role in the surveillance and maintenance of properly
assembled and functioning NPCs in yeast. Critically, work in these non-CNS systems suggests that
recruitment of CHMP7 to the nuclear envelope initiates downstream events leading to degradation of Nups and
NPCs. Indeed, the reduction of Nups from the NPC in C9orf72 human neurons appears to be the result of
aberrant activation of CHMP7 and ESCRT-III mediated degradation pathways and not the result of Nup
mislocalization or alterations in Nup mRNA metabolism. However, little is actually known about how these
initial discoveries relate to the far more common sporadic ALS (sALS). Using super resolution structured
illumination microscopy (SIM) on a subset of sALS iPSC derived spinal neurons, we have generated
preliminary data that strongly suggests NPC and Nup defects are a prevalent pathology in sALS. Notably, in
about 50% of sALS iPSNs and postmortem motor cortex samples examined to date, we also observe robust
CHMP7 pathology, reminiscent of our studies in C9orf72 ALS/FTD. Collectively, these early studies have led
us to hypothesize that in human neurons, aberrant activation of the ESCRT-III pathway may be a substantial
contributor to disruptions in the NPC, NCT, and overall cellular survival thus highlighting the potential for
CHMP7 as a therapeutic target in ALS and related neurodegenerative diseases characterized by NPC injury.
Here, we will use iPSNs and postmortem human CNS tissue to comprehensively define the alterations to
individual Nups and NPCs in sALS pathogenesis (Aim 1). Furthermore, we will evaluate the contribution of
CHMP7 and aberrant ESCRT-III mediated degradation to NPC injury in sALS (Aim 2). Finally, we will define
the mechanism by which CHMP7 is pathologically “activated” to initiate NPC injury in sALS (Aim 3).
Collectively, these experiments will significantly advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying
NPC homeostasis in human neurons and sALS disease and provide novel insights into potential new
therapeutic targets. Moreover, the proposed studies will set the stage for future investigations into the role of
CHMP7 and Nup degradation in the pathogenesis of FTD and other related neurodegenerative diseases."

Policymakers are pursuing strategies to integrate coverage for dual-eligibles—individuals with Medicare and
Medicaid—to better coordinate care across these programs. Dual-Eligible Special Needs Plans (D-SNPs)—
Medicare Advantage plans that exclusively serve duals—have emerged as the largest category of plans
intended to serve as a platform for integration. However, D-SNPs vary in their level of integration with
Medicaid. While many D-SNPs meet only a minimum level of integration (primarily related to care
coordination), a growing number of plans have attained greater integration by covering Medicare and Medicaid
spending for the same patients. CMS continues to refine integration standards for D-SNPs and policymakers
have called for designing these standards to improve the quality, efficiency, and equity of care for duals—a
priority given this population’s medical and social vulnerability. Yet little evidence exists about the extent to
which differences among D-SNPs, including plan attributes and state policies affecting integration, are linked to
quality, care patterns that drive spending, or disparities. Further, there is no evidence about how policy levers
to expand enrollment in integrated D-SNPs affect care. One such lever is default enrollment—a mechanism
that allows certain Medicaid managed care plans to automatically enroll Medicaid beneficiaries into integrated
D-SNPs when they become dual eligibles (e.g., at age 65). Although only some D-SNPs are permitted to use
default enrollment, there is interest in expanding this mechanism. To inform policy, this project will provide new
evidence about variations in the performance of D-SNPs, including by factors affecting these plans’ level of
Medicaid integration (Aim 1); assess plan performance and disparities in vulnerable subgroups of duals,
including Black and Hispanic duals, duals with a disability, and those with behavioral health conditions (Aim 2);
and investigate the effects of using default enrollment to integrate coverage, leveraging variation between
plans permitted to use this mechanism and a quasi-experimental difference-in-differences design (Aim 3). To
measure key aspects of plan performance relevant to integration, we will use Medicaid T-MSIS data, Medicare
Advantage encounter data, and nursing facility assessment data linked at the beneficiary level (Aims 1-3) and
CAHPS patient experience surveys (Aims 1-2). Continuous updating of these data allows us to monitor
changes in performance as CMS phases in new D-SNP integration standards, enabling us to evaluate and
inform evolving policy. This project is directly related to AHRQ priorities and priority populations through its
focus on how the design of D-SNPs—an emerging managed care model for complex patients—affects quality,
efficiency, and equity of care. To maximize this project’s impact, we will work with a Policy Advisory Committee
of experts in integration policy from the government, research, and insurance sectors, building on the team’s
track record of translating health services research to inform policy."
10684781,"Vertebral fractures (VF) afflict more than 25% of people over age 50, and their burden is growing. Current
approaches for estimating VF risk, which rely heavily on measurement of the average bone mineral density
(BMD) in the vertebra, are known to be insufficient, but the search for better diagnostics is hindered by poor
understanding of the pathogenesis of VF. Increasing evidence suggests that the risk, mechanisms, and
outcomes of VF depend critically on the interaction of tissues near the interface between the vertebra and the
intervertebral disc. This endplate region is defined as the cartilage endplate (CEP), the bony endplate (BEP),
and the subchondral trabecular bone (STB). The disc mediates how the net force borne by a given vertebra is
distributed over the surface of the endplate (“endplate loading”), and the endplate region mediates how this
force distribution is transferred to the rest of the vertebra. The mechanical behaviors of the disc and endplate
region are therefore expected to affect when and how the vertebra fails. Indeed, we have found that VF in
elderly vertebrae commonly initiate within the endplate region, and that the way this region fails is influenced
by not only the microstructure of this region but also the extent of degeneration in the adjacent disc. Moreover,
recent data suggest that the mechanical behavior of the endplate region may change with aging and disc
degeneration in ways that are not well predicted by the average BMD of the vertebra. These collective findings
reveal a paradigm in which delineation of the biomechanical interactions between the endplate region and disc
holds an important key to identifying risk factors for VF and, consequently, to reducing the incidence and
burden of VF. As such, the overall goal of this project is to define how degeneration and aging of the disc
and endplate region influence the mechanisms of VF. Aim #1 will quantify the dependence of endplate loading
on disc degeneration and will use non-invasively obtained estimates of endplate loading to develop accurate,
patient-specific, finite element (FE) simulations of VF. This Aim will capitalize on recent advances in magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI)-based assessments of the disc to achieve a novel integration of the state-of-the-art
in clinically feasible FE models of the disc and vertebra. Aim #2 will address the current paucity of data on the
biomechanics of the endplate region. Using mechanical testing, µFE modeling and biochemical assays, we will
identify the extent to which properties such as the brittleness of the BEP, strength of the STB, and stiffness of
the CEP change with age and disc degeneration. Aim #3 will focus on the way in which the endplate region
fails during VF. Motivated by clinical and pre-clinical observations that disc health declines more rapidly
following VFs that involve fracture of the BEP, as opposed to those that involve failure of only the STB, we will
use both experiment and large-scale µFE models to identify characteristics of the disc and endplate region that
are associated with BEP fracture. Altogether, these three Aims constitute a mechanistic, innovative, and
interdisciplinary approach that will enable a step change in the understanding, prevention, and treatment of VF."
10874660,"Although enrollment in private Medicare plans has risen from 12.8% in 2004 to 37.5% in 2019, the health
consequences of large numbers of older Americans enrolling in these plans are not clear. This is of
particular concern for high-risk patients, people with selected chronic conditions that place them at
higher risk of adverse outcomes. Private Medicare plans are typically managed care plans that receive a
capitated payment for each plan enrollee and therefore face financial incentives to control costs.
Although high-risk patients could potentially benefit if some private Medicare plans are able to improve
health outcomes through care coordination or by steering patients to high-quality health care providers,
they could also be adversely impacted if some private Medicare plans achieve cost savings by reducing
provision of necessary or preventive care. This Career Development Award proposal, “Private Medicare
Plans and Health Outcomes for Older Adults,” focuses on leveraging new data—from private Medicare
encounter claims, a state all-payer claims database, and the private Medicare risk adjustment system—in
order to better understand how private Medicare plans impact health outcomes for older adults,
particularly among high-risk patients. This work will focus on evaluating the performance of specific
private Medicare plans—as opposed to evaluating private Medicare plans as a whole—something made
possible by the recent availability of comprehensive health care claims data from private Medicare plans.
Examining plan-specific effects will allow for a more complete understanding of whether there are
specialized private Medicare plans that can improve health outcomes for high-risk patients. The research
aims encompass three areas: 1) estimating plan-specific effects of private Medicare plans on quality of
care and patient outcomes, 2) evaluating the performance of private Medicare plans that specialize in
improving health outcomes for high-risk patients, and 3) using prediction methods to quantify the
potential for favorable selection by private Medicare plans. This work will make use of quasi-
experimental methods to estimate whether enrollment in specific private Medicare plans is associated
with better health outcomes; for example, by studying patients who transition from an employer-
sponsored plan to a private Medicare plan, or patients who switch from traditional Medicare to a private
Medicare plan. This award will also support additional training toward three career goals that support
the research aims: 1) developing expertise in measurement of health care quality and improvement of
patient outcomes, 2) acquiring knowledge of clinical management of high-risk patients, and 3) building
skills in statistical methods used for prediction and modeling health outcomes. These goals will be
achieved through coursework, mentorship, seminars, and research, among a highly productive group of
health economics and health policy scholars at a leading institution."

Alcohol use disorders, substance use disorders, and mental health comorbidities are a major threat to ending
the HIV epidemic. This is especially the case in Alabama and other priority states within the U.S. ‘Ending the HIV
Epidemic’ initiative. Addressing unhealthy alcohol use and mental health comorbidities in the Deep South is
made difficult by poverty and lack of public health services. Because of the similar challenges in low-resource
settings, interventions developed for low and middle-income countries (LMIC) hold promise for reducing
unhealthy alcohol use in people living with HIV (PLWH) in Alabama and improving psychosocial comorbidities
that disproportionately impact this population. Designed to address the limited mental health workforce in LMIC,
Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA) is a promising treatment for unhealthy alcohol use and mental
health comorbidities in Alabama. CETA is a multi-session cognitive behavioral therapy-based intervention that
employs transdiagnostic techniques to address comorbid alcohol use, other substance use, and mental health
symptoms through a single provider. CETA has been proven effective in at least 7 LMICs, with specific support
for reducing depressive symptoms and unhealthy alcohol misuse. The proposed study is a randomized trial,
Telemedicine for unhealthy Alcohol use in persons Living with HIV using CETA (TALC study), to achieve the
following aims: 1) Evaluate the effectiveness of T-CETA on unhealthy alcohol use among PLWH, 2) Evaluate
the effectiveness of T-CETA on HIV outcomes, 3) Evaluate the effectiveness of T-CETA on SUD and mental
health comorbidities, and 4) Evaluate implementation factors related to BI and T-CETA provision to people with
HIV unhealthy alcohol use in care at community clinics in Alabama including feasibility, acceptability, cost and
cost-effectiveness. PLWH (n = 308) from community-based HIV clinics in Alabama will be enrolled in the trial.
Patients will be eligible if they self-report unhealthy alcohol use on a validated tool (AUDIT), which is assessed
every 4-6 months as part of routine care. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to a brief alcohol intervention (BI)
versus BI plus T-CETA (n = 154 per arm). This is one of two program projects aiming to test the effectiveness of
CETA on unhealthy alcohol use, mental health comorbidities, and HIV outcomes among PLWH residing in
underserved areas. If the project aims are achieved, it will significantly advance our understanding of strategies
to reduce HIV disease progression and transmission in Alabama and advance the President’s Plan to End the
HIV Epidemic. Following achievement of these aims, we plan to conduct a multi-site implementation study to
address barriers identified in the implementation assessment (Aim 4) and translate study findings into routine
community care in other priority states for reducing HIV across the Southern U.S."
10908486,"Alcohol consumption is an important modifiable cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor among people living
with HIV infection (PLWH). Given that alcohol use is common among PLWH, and CVD is a leading non-AIDS
disease and cause of death among PLWH, addressing alcohol consumption in this population is critically
important. The Microbiome, mETabolites, and Alcohol in HIV to reduce CVD Program Project Grant (PPG) is a
multidisciplinary group of investigators with expertise in alcohol, HIV, gut microbiome, biomarker research,
nutrition, and randomized controlled trial (RCT) design. Our overarching hypothesis for this P01 application
is that among PLWH, a probiotic can mitigate alcohol associated dysbiosis and lower levels of microbial
translocation, inflammation, and improve metabolite profiles (Project 1); and that harmful levels of these
metabolites are associated with higher risk of CVD and death events (Project 2). To test this hypothesis, this
PPG will leverage the Veterans Aging Cohort Study, the Uganda Russia Boston Alcohol Network for Alcohol
Research Collaboration on HIV/AIDS, the Integrated Metagenomic and Metabolomic Core (IMMC) at the
University of Louisville Alcohol Research Center, and the Vanderbilt SCHolars in HIV and Heart, Lung, Blood,
and Sleep ReSearch NIH K12 junior faculty training program to accomplish these objectives: (1) To determine
if a probiotic tailored for alcohol associated gut dysbiosis mitigates this dysbiosis, microbial translocation,
inflammation, harmful metabolites, CVD and mortality risk (Project 1 RCT, Lead Freiberg); (2) To assess the
association between alcohol use, CVD and death via three metabolic pathways among PLWH (Project 2
Cohort, Lead So-Armah); (3) To provide metabolomic and biomarker laboratory resources (IMMC, Lead
Barve); (4) Administrative leadership and services to support the proposed research (Admin Core, Leads
Freiberg and Barve); and (5) Encourage and develop future trainees. The Administrative (Admin) Core will be
responsible for day-to-day management and functioning of the PPG. The Admin Core goal is to ensure that
the scientific and programmatic activities of the PPG are conducted per protocol in a timely fashion, within
budget, and with the highest quality. The Admin Core has these specific aims: (1) To provide administrative
oversight of the PPG, including assembling a steering committee, program advisory committee, and data
safety monitoring board, and developing the policies and procedures necessary to successfully organize and
complete our specific aims and training initiatives; (2) To provide services to PPG investigators and trainees
(e.g., study progress reports, compliance assurance, assistance with presentations and publications), and to
promote/disseminate the PPG'S work; (3) To provide resources (e.g., data and specimens), biostatistical
support, and mentorship to new investigators ; (4) To promote synergy within and across other funded PPGs;
(5) To monitor progress and compliance of the PPG's components, implement improvement mechanisms if
necessary, and assist investigators with challenges (e.g., recruitment)."
10908489,"The Integrated Metagenomics and Metabolomics Core (IMMC) will provide a platform that interconnects
Projects 1 and 2. Specifically, IMMC will provide high-quality, metagenomics and targeted metabolomics data,
to be integrated with the probiotics randomized clinical trial and clinical cohort outcomes for Projects 1 and 2,
respectively. The IMMC has already acquired relevant metagenomics and metabolomics data (see Preliminary
data sections E1.2 and F.1.A.2) that supports the experimental rationale and study design for Projects 1 and 2.
To ensure optimal scientific output from the study samples, the IMMC has implemented standardized
procedures for collection of samples from Projects 1 and 2 study sites, and established logistics to coordinate
shipment of samples for analysis, manage inventory, and enable tracking of chain of custody.
 For Project 1, IMMC - sub-core 1 will conduct state of the art metagenomics analysis of fecal samples
collected from study participants receiving probiotics supplementation, to profile the changes in the gut
microbial communities. The culture- independent molecular methods will consist of 16S rRNA gene and whole
genome shotgun (WGS) metagenomic sequencing that provide the most comprehensive microbiota profiling.
Rigorous sequence data analysis will utilize a set of advanced computational algorithms, according to taxon-
based or function-based data matrices. IMMC- sub-core 2 will conduct targeted metabolomics analysis of
plasma/serum (Projects 1 and 2) to monitor host and gut-microbiota metabolomes.
 The IMMC will collaborate with Projects to develop meaningful study designs, implement effective sample
collection and storage strategies, generate high-quality metagenomics and targeted metabolomics data,
computationally summarize these data and support interpretation of the results. It will implement high-quality
techniques, along with quality control standards, that produce meaningful results in a timely fashion. The IMMC
will also standardize data generation methods across studies to enable integration across Projects and
uncover robust discoveries.
 To accomplish these goals the IMMC has established the following aims:
1. Employ metagenomic approaches to generate and analytically summarize project microbiome data.
2. Perform targeted metabolomics analyses to profile plasma/serum metabolites.
3. Manage specimen and data biorepository and facilitate transfer between research Projects."

Private equity acquisitions have accelerated in primary care, comprising thousands of physicians covering
hundreds of thousands of lives across the U.S. Despite this growth, the effects of these acquisitions on clinical
and economic outcomes remains unknown. Limited evidence in other parts of the delivery system, including
nursing homes, hospitals, and procedural specialists, shows that PE acquisition is associated with higher
prices and spending, as well as potential negative effects on quality. How PE ownership of primary care
practices affects the health and health care of Medicare beneficiaries is a fundamental question, as Medicare
covers primary care for nearly 60 million beneficiaries with chronic diseases - an AHRQ priority population.
This proposal focuses on the specific mechanisms by which PE firms may affect provider behavior under
different financial incentives in Traditional Medicare (TM) and Medicare Advantage (MA), and estimates effects
on quality of care and patient outcomes. We propose to link primary care acquisition data to TM claims and MA
encounter data from 2016-2024; using a quasi-experimental event study framework, we compare changes
among beneficiaries in PE-acquired primary care practices with matched control beneficiaries of non-PE
acquired primary care practices. In TM, we hypothesize that PE increases the utilization of services, and
specifically low-value services like unnecessary or wasteful tests, imaging, or procedures. In MA, increased
utilization can be counterproductive under a capitated budget, and we thus hypothesize that PE maximizes
revenue through differentially more intensive coding of clinical diagnoses to garner higher risk-adjusted
payments from the federal government. Our aims are to: 1) examine changes in provider behavior associated
with PE acquisition of primary care practices, including utilization of low-value services and diagnostic coding
intensity; 2) estimate changes in quality of care and patient outcomes; and 3) understand treatment effect
heterogeneity, including by patient racial/ethnic and geographic composition, as well as by provider and
practice characteristics. We apply a number of innovations, including the development of a novel dataset of PE
acquisitions in primary care, which will be made publicly available for future use. In order to better approach
causal inference, we also apply statistical innovations, including identification strategies in difference-in-
differences analyses, risk set matching and cardinality matching to match a treated individual to comparable
controls, and application of minimum variance balance weights. Findings will provide novel, timely, and
comprehensive quantitative assessments of changes in key clinical and economic outcomes associated with a
growing trend of PE ownership in primary care, and will be highly policy relevant as federal and state
governments consider ways to preserve and support access to high-value primary care.

10894819,"The overarching goal of our lab is to decipher cellular heterogeneity, dynamics, and inheritability using high-
throughput and longitudinal single-cell analysis. Specifically, we will focus on chemotaxis toward CXCL12 as a
model. Cell migration is an essential process in embryogenesis, angiogenesis, wound healing, inflammation,
and cancer metastasis. Failure of cell migration can lead to defective inflammatory responses and poor repair of
injured tissues. At the same time, fast migration of cancer cells is associated metastasis. Although many
environmental cues, physiological processes, transcription factors, and organelle features have been discovered
to regulate cell migration, we have limited understanding about why individual cells respond differently. Given
the limitations of long-standing migration assays in tracking and selectively isolating individual cells, we
developed a high-throughput single-cell migration platform that coordinates robotic liquid handling and
autonomous image processing for rapidly quantifying motility of thousands of cells. Based on the observed
cellular heterogeneity in our preliminary studies, we hypothesize that distinct mechanisms are used to enhance
motility in different cells, including CXCL12 dependent signals as well as intrinsic motility drivers. We will isolate
and profile fast-moving cell populations with single-cell molecular and functional analysis to test this hypothesis.
We will inhibit individual and combination of multiple motility drivers to examine whether the movement of all
cells can be stopped. We will further examine whether elevated cellular motility can be maintained over time and
pinpoint key molecular features, focusing on copy number alterations and skewed expression of transcription
factors. Compared to cellular characteristics driven by transient randomness, inheritable and stable alterations
will be valuable biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Moreover, emerging evidence suggests the importance of
molecular dynamics in signal transduction to determine cellular responses. Based on the preliminary data, we
expect that sharp increase of the stimulus concentration rather than the duration of treatment is the key to induce
cell movement. With the cutting-edge single-cell tracking capability, we will collect time-varying and quantitative
information of thousands of cells, including cellular speed and persistence and fluorescent reporters of key
migratory regulators. The dynamic cell data will reveal unique temporal patterns in fast- and slow- moving cells,
which cannot be revealed with conventional one-time measurements. In addition to in vitro studies, we will track
cell movement in the mouse ear skin with multiphoton intravital microscopy. We expect that without treatment,
most cells move slowly yet a small number of cells move rapidly in vivo. Furthermore, the treatments that
suppress in vitro cell movement will function in the same way in vivo. The proposed multi-dimensional cell
migration studies will change how we understand cellular decision in migration and heterogeneity between cells.
While we focus on chemotaxis toward CXCL12, we envision the technology and paradigm we establish will be
widely applied to regulate heterogeneous cell populations in other contexts."
10897276,"ABSTRACT. Tobacco use is the world’s leading cause of preventable death, according to the World Health
Organization. Within the US, cigarette smoking cases approximately one in five deaths, accounting for more than
480K deaths each year. Tobacco users who strive to quit usually relapse. In 2018, approximately 55% of adults
in the US who smoked tobacco had made a quit attempt within the past year; only roughly 8% successfully quit
for 6-12 months. Because of this, novel approaches are necessary to improve nicotine cessation success rates.
Nicotine, a compound highly involved in nicotine use disorder (NUD), binds to neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine
receptors (nAChRs) to activate brain reward and positive reinforcement circuits. Further, nicotine use results in
cholinergic tone imbalance caused, in part, by dysregulation of the nAChR α4β2 subtype. The neuronal α4β2
subtype expresses in two isoforms with high and low sensitivity to nicotinic agonist (HS (α4β2)2β2 and LS
(α4β2)2α4, respectively). Nicotine upregulates functional α4β2 nAChRs and enriches plasma membrane
expression of the HS (α4β2)2β2 isoform. These changes result in hypersensitive brain reward
(mesocorticolimbic) circuits while enhancing dopamine levels that reinforce rewarding behavior, contributing to
NUD. Restoring the cholinergic tone to be less sensitive and comparable to pre-nicotine levels, is likely to be
critical in the development of an efficacious approach to treating NUD. Little is known regarding chaperone
protein regulation of α4β2 nAChR isoforms, a key proposal mission, and the ability of chaperone proteins to
counteract nicotine-driven α4β2 isoform imbalance. To begin to answer some of these questions, we propose to
define the basis of visinin-like protein-1 (VILIP-1) functional effects on receptor physiology, the interaction site,
and VILIP-1-driven changes in α4β2 nAChR plasma membrane expression. Our preliminary data consistently
show VILIP-1 attenuates α4β2 nAChR function and enhances plasma membrane expression. These underlying
findings led us to our hypothesis that leveraging the interactions between VILIP-1 and α4β2 nAChRs by a small
molecule may be a novel approach to treating NUD. Defining the VILIP-1/α4β2 nAChR interaction site, as
proposed here, will remove critical barriers that stymie scientific and clinical NUD work, in addition to other
conditions affected by α4β2 nAChR dysregulation. We will pursue the aims of this proposal by combining
electrophysiology studies of receptor function with live cell confocal microscopy. Funding of this application will
provide foundational support for PI Weltzin’s progress towards becoming an independent and established
researcher by demonstrating project fundability and feasibility, assay advancement, preliminary data generation,
and senior-author publications. Her mentorship team includes Drs. Miwa and Whiteaker, established nAChR
experts. In addition, the proposal will provide hands-on research support for underrepresented students in
biomedical science. Activities supported by this proposal will sustenance and enrich the research environment
at the University of Alaska Fairbanks."
10899577,"Project Summary/Abstract
Severe obesity in children is a highly prevalent, serious and chronic disease that directly leads to severe obesity
in adults and the subsequent enormous social and financial burden on society. Lifestyle therapy is the
cornerstone of pediatric obesity treatment, but this intervention when used alone is often insufficient for achieving
clinically significant and durable BMI reduction. Adjunct anti-obesity medications may improve outcomes of this
disease, but the pharmacological options used for obesity in children are extremely limited. Thus there is an
urgency to identify anti-obesity medications for use in the pediatric population, which are safe, effective, easily
administered and affordable. Psychostimulants, the second most commonly prescribed class of medications in
children, have a long-standing safety profile and because of their favorable effect on weight, may serve as a
useful adjunct to lifestyle therapy for the treatment of severe obesity in this population. Thus, the goal of this pilot
and feasibility clinical trial is to estimate the treatment effect of a common psychostimulant, lisdexamfetamine,
for the treatment of severe obesity in children. Specifically, 44 children ages 6 to <12 years with severe obesity
(BMI ≥120% of the 95th percentile) will be randomized, 1:1, to lisdexamfetamine plus lifestyle therapy or placebo
plus lifestyle therapy for 24 weeks of treatment. The primary outcome of the main aim will be change in BMI,
and secondary outcomes will include changes in body composition, cardiometabolic health, and quality of life.
The second aim will be to identify participant tolerability of the recommended starting dose of lisdexamfetamine
and the emergence of clinically significant increases in blood pressure and heart rate. Potential mechanisms by
which lisdexamfetamine reduces BMI will also be explored including changes in executive functioning, reward
processing, appetite, resting energy expenditure, and health behaviors (diet, eating behaviors, and physical
activity). The results of this pivotal pilot trial will directly inform the conduct of the larger, fully powered, definitive
study, which ultimately, by identifying a safe, effective and scalable treatment, will improve the outcomes of the
millions of children affected by this serious, chronic disease."

Over the past two decades significant effort has been directed to the identification of ligands that target
the regulation of epigenetic marks. These post-translational modifications (PTMs) control all aspects of
gene expression and are often deregulated in disease, providing attractive vectors for therapeutic
intervention. Currently, despite significant investment, marketed drugs in this area have generally
arisen from phenotypic screening as opposed to a priori design. One reason for this lack of success is
the high degree of complexity within epigenetic regulation, where a protein target may perform multiple
contradictory roles based upon cellular context. Additionally, the high homology between epigenetic
proteins and their isoforms makes the design of selective inhibitors incredibly challenging. It is therefore
critical that both the protein targets of a given ligand and the downstream epigenetic consequences are
well characterized before clinical evaluation. This presents a singular challenge as epigenetic states
(and therefore epigenetic consequences) differ dramatically between cell types and populations. In this
proposal, we will develop proximity proteomics methods to understand how small molecule ligands
remodel the chromatin microenvironment over time. We will achieve this through the targeted
deployment of iridium catalysts to chromatin via ultrafast split intein splicing. Upon visible light
irradiation, these catalysts activate biotin bearing diazirines within a short radius (through a process
called Dexter energy transfer) which subsequently release molecular nitrogen and a highly reactive
carbene. These carbenes insert into C-H and X-H bonds of biomolecules within ~10 nm, which can be
enriched for downstream ‘omics analysis. This method will be used to monitor the biomolecules that
associate to and dissociate from chromatin following ligand incubation. At short time points, this will
provide target identification as ligand bound proteins no longer interact with chromatin. Following longer
incubation, we will measure the functional effect of inhibition of epigenetic modulators as chromatin
PTMs reach a new steady state. We will apply this method to two important areas of chromatin
regulation that have been the target of intense drug development with limited success, lysine
demethylation and c-myc based transcription. We hope to use this method to shed light on these
important vectors for gene regulation, identifying new protein targets and off-targets of established
inhibitor classes. Broadly, this project will provide a valuable tool to study ligands acting at chromatin
that can be applied to many aspects of nuclear biology and drug development, paving the way for better
drug candidates, and ultimately improving human health."
10928716,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A molecular imaging revolution is underway in prostate cancer. To overcome longstanding limitations in
prostate cancer staging, several positron-emission tomography (PET) scans have recently been approved and
rapidly integrated into clinical care based on evidence of improved diagnostic accuracy. However, the
consequences of widespread PET imaging are unknown. This is because the approvals of these tests are
based on improved diagnostic accuracy, a surrogate endpoint, rather than direct evidence of patient benefit. By
finding small sites of cancer earlier, PET imaging could introduce a cascade of effects—both positive and
negative—that could vary from patient to patient. PET imaging could lead to improved survival and fewer
symptoms from metastatic cancer in a subset, but could also increase treatment toxicity, psychological
burdens, and costs in others. Currently, no information is available to help guide patients or stakeholders when
considering these tradeoffs. To reduce these uncertainties, our goal is to develop a decision model that
considers the effects of PET imaging across multiple dimensions. To inform this model, we will generate real-
world evidence from a diversity of sources. In aim one, we will conduct complementary analyses of large,
nationally representative databases to evaluate the effectiveness of PET imaging, focusing on the associations
between imaging initiation of systemic therapy, progression to hormone-refractory disease, and costs. In aim
two, we will measure the longitudinal impact of PET imaging on patient-reported outcome measures relating to
psychological effects (anxiety and uncertainty) and health-related quality of life. To gain a deeper perspective
about patient experiences with testing we will also conduct longitudinal qualitative interviews among a smaller
subset of patients and integrate the findings from quantitative and qualitative sources. In the third study aim we
will incorporate inputs from Aims 1 and 2 to construct individual-based state-transition microsimulation models
examining common scenarios for PET imaging use. The outputs from these models will include estimates of
effectiveness, as well as patient characteristics that may be associated with greater or lesser degrees of
benefit or harm. The results of this study will equip patients, providers, and other prostate cancer stakeholders
with practical, new information about the potential short and long-term effects of PET imaging. If successful,
this approach for evaluating effectiveness will be applicable to other similar molecular imaging modalities that
will soon enter clinical care on the basis of surrogate endpoints of improved diagnostic accuracy, but without
evidence of long-term clinical efficacy."

The objective of the proposed research is to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms underlying the exquisite
substrate binding and catalytic specificity of two phosphatidylinositol phosphate 5-kinases (PIP5K, PIKfyve).
The PIPK family of lipid kinases include PIP5K (type 1), PIP4K (type 2) and PIKfyve (type 3), and is primarily
responsible for converting phosphatidylinositol monophosphate lipids into PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,5)P2. Despite
sequence homology, these kinases are highly selective in substrate binding [PIP5K binds PI(4)P, PIP4K binds
PI(5)P, and PIKfyve binds PI(3)P] and in catalytic activity [PIP5K and PIKfyve phosphorylate the C5 hydroxyl of
the lipid's inositol head group, whereas PIP4K phosphorylates the C4 hydroxyl]. We and others have
previously identified two structural elements within the kinase domain, the specificity loop and a conserved
PIP-binding motif, that contribute to substrate selectivity, but how these two elements cooperate to confer
kinase specificity remains undefined at the structural level. In aim 1, we plan crosslinking strategies to stabilize
the specificity loop to facilitate co-crystallization with lipid substrates. We also plan to generate and crystallize a
minimalistic catalytic core domain of PIKfyve. In aim 2, we propose genetic and chemical biological
experiments to examine the role of PIKfyve in the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2. Several large-scale drug
repurposing programs have identified apilimod, a PIKfyve inhibitor, as a top lead in suppressing SARS-CoV-2
replication in cell culture (a phase II clinical trial of apilimod in treating COVID-19 is ongoing at the Yale Center
for Clinical Investigation). This discovery, together with earlier observations that apilimod also reduces infection
by Ebola and Marburg viruses, has generated great interest in pharmacologically targeting PIKfyve. Drawing
on structural and biochemical knowledge about the lipid kinase family, as well as chemical tools previously
developed to target PIP4K, we have discovered a new class of potent PIKfyve inhibitors and plan to use them
together with apilimod to interrogate how PIKfyve inhibition disrupts SARS-CoV-2 infection. All previously
known PIKfyve inhibitors are structurally related to apilimod, and their binding mode to the lipid kinase is
unknown. The new inhibitor class is significant because it not only adds confidence to the proposed
involvement of PIKfyve in SARS-CoV-2 infection, but also has a known binding mode to PIPK, which should
facilitate future optimization by medicinal chemistry."

The focus of the Zadrozny laboratory is the design of metal complexes for noninvasive sensing
of physiological chemistry. The broader goal of the effort is to make molecular probes that
overcome inherent challenges in electron paramagnetic resonance imaging (EPRI), the unpaired
electron analog to conventional 1H MRI. EPRI can sense local chemistry and could produce
comprehensive chemical and anatomical maps of the body if merged with 1H MRI. Modern EPRI
molecular imaging probes are organic radicals which require dangerous high-energy microwaves
for use in the large magnetic field of an MRI scanner. Hence, the two techniques remain
disconnected. For EPRI to enable imaging of physiological chemistry by integration with MRI, new
probes must be developed to avoid high frequency microwaves at high magnetic fields. The next
five years of the Zadrozny lab’s work involve exploring high-spin metal complexes as an
alternative platform to radicals for molecular probes in EPRI. A key inherent advantage of metal
ions is that the unique electronic feature of large zero-field splitting enables the possibility of safe,
low-frequency microwave use at high magnetic field. Hence, metal complexes with this feature
could provide a completely new set of EPRI molecular imaging probes with capabilities
unmatched by organic radicals. However, all of the basic EPR spectral properties of metal
complexes with low frequency microwaves are unmapped. The Zadrozny lab will amend this
knowledge gap. The work will use synthetic inorganic chemistry and spectroscopic analyses to
(1) understand how to target the frequency/field of the resonance to match the magnetic fields of
MRI scanners with low-frequency microwaves (2) understand how to control the linewidth of the
low-frequency EPR resonances to enhance resolution, and (3) how to merge radical/metal
chemistry in hybrid molecules to gain the advantages of both metals and radicals for a single
molecular probe system. Meeting these objectives will provide a new class of imaging probe
capable of mapping physiological chemistry in a conventional MRI scanner."
10891589,"ABSTRACT
I seek to characterize proteomic and fundamental molecular properties of bacteria and human cells under
oxidative stress as a means to understand mechanistic underpinnings of sensitivity phenotypes.
1) Oxidative stress broadly impacts protein function, but it is very challenging to experimentally determine
which protein malfunctions lead to cellular stress phenotypes. I propose a structural systems biology approach
to answering these questions for induced stress in E. coli and human cells. Genome-scale metabolic network
reconstruction will be integrated with solved and modeled protein structures to enable detailed models of
proteomic oxidative damage and its impact on cellular metabolism, permitting stress simulations and prediction
of metabolic bottlenecks. Predicted stress phenotypes will be validated by proteomics, metabolomics, and
targeted in vitro enzyme activity assays under oxidative stress. This approach will reveal protein targets to
inform future efforts in diagnosing and treating oxidative-stress-associated conditions including radiation
toxicity, metabolic dysfunction, and aging.
2) I will develop a theoretical model of molecular sensitivity to oxidative damage of generic proteins of interest
and serve for design and engineering more robust variants. Redox proteomics can identify oxidation sites at
residue resolution on specific proteins or proteome-wide. Analysis of this data in the context of 3D protein
structures will uncover molecular properties rendering some sites and proteins more vulnerable than others. I
will validate the model in the context of mammalian glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH),
which aggregates on the mitochondrial membrane causing dysfunction under oxidative stress. I will combine
the model for molecular vulnerability to oxidation with evolutionary sequence conservation analysis to design
oxidation-robust GAPDH variants. These designs will be experimentally characterized through recombinantly
expressed proteins and cell-based assays for enzyme activity, oxidation states, and phenotypic outcomes
under stress. Results will have implications for human diseases related to GAPDH dysfunction and will serve
as a foundation for rational design of stress-resistant proteins, a significant technological advance.
3) I will investigate the functionality of specialized intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) for cellular protection
against oxidative stress. Exploiting the model case of GAPDH oxidation again, here I will not alter GAPDH
itself but introduce synthetic IDPs engineered to target the mitochondrial outer membrane or GAPDH directly
through molecular interactions. Some IDPs are known to form protective barriers to reactive oxygen species
(ROS) or disaggregate proteins, and I will investigate whether these can serve to protect GAPDH under stress.
Designs will be tested on purified GAPDH in enzymatic activity assays and in cell-based assays for
mitochondrial dysfunction and protein oxidation. This work would further the fundamental understanding of
IDP function and lay groundwork for therapeutic development."

10890707,"Project Summary
To be a productive member of a collective, a cell must precisely and dynamically partition its own contents.
Therefore, pathways that generate asymmetry in the cell, commonly referred to as polarity, are essential for
development and homeostasis. How cells create de novo polarity and harness asymmetry to diversify cellular
populations during morphogenesis remain important and open areas of study. The molecular logic that generates
and sustains highly conserved polarity domains has been thoroughly studied in animals and yeast and has led
to the creation of synthetic circuits capable of generating polarity in vitro. However, there are still significant
challenges to interrogating these pathways in situ, where technical limitations make it difficult to track individual
cells over days in developing animals as they transit through multiple identities. To overcome this hurdle, the
proposed work will interrogate polarity pathways within developing plant tissues, where observation of subcellular
dynamics can be paired to long-term tracking of full developmental decisions at single-cell resolution. Plants
harness polarity for many of the same functions as animal cells, including regulation of asymmetric cell division
and organelle positioning. Importantly, our recent progress investigating the formation and functions for cell
polarity in developing Arabidopsis leaves highlights that these polarity circuits have both commonalities with and
differences from canonical polarity pathways in animals. Therefore, our investigations will advance
understanding of polarity mechanisms broadly and introduce an experimentally tractable and independently
evolved system to test the generality of polarity models.
Specifically, our aims are to 1) determine the molecular interactions that create polarity within leaf progenitors,
2) delineate the pathways that couple polarity to organelle topography for tissue formation, and 3) identify the
control points where extrinsic signals regulate polarity pathways. We have developed imaging platforms, new
genetic tools, and analysis pipelines that will allow us to make rapid progress on our aims. Taken together, we
expect that we will identify novel means of harnessing polarity in cells, with potential future applications as tools
to exert spatial control for bioengineering purposes and human health."
10908641,"Project Summary: The goal of the study is to contribute to efforts to improve health outcomes for adolescents
living with HIV (ALHIV) in sub-Saharan Africa, a population of high demographic, clinical and epidemiological
importance. We aim to advance this goal by creating and testing in Kisumu, Kenya, a smartphone game-based
intervention for ALHIV aged 15-18 (MyLife). It will focus on increasing adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART)
and addressing sexual and reproductive health needs. It will be informed by socio-behavioral, communication
and pedagogical theories, evidence-based practice, and unique research on young Africans’ narratives about HIV.
It will be designed to increase ALHIV knowledge, motivation, skills, and resources to facilitate: (1) increased
autonomy in treatment management and self-care; (2) mental health and strategies for addressing stigma; (3)
social support including via dialogue with caregivers and disclosure to others; and (4) sexual risk avoidance and
reduction. The increasing availability of smartphones in Africa provides unprecedented opportunities to deliver
culturally relevant narrative-based behavioral interventions for ALHIV that incorporate digital resources to
support adherence such as medication and refill trackers and reminders. Such interventions require little
personnel to implement, have high entertainment and motivation appeal, and incorporate automated data
collection to support theory-building. By allowing players to experience real agency in a virtual and safe
environment, well-designed games offer a level of experiential learning unparalleled by most other interventions.
 The proposed project has the following aims: (1) (R21) To design, develop, and conduct usability,
acceptability, and safety testing of a theory-based smartphone game for ALHIV ages 15-18 focused on increasing
and sustaining engagement in HIV care and sexual risk avoidance and reduction, with iterative input from the
target population; (2) (R33) Via a cluster-randomized controlled trial with a sample of 120 ALHIV ages 15-18 in
Kisumu to conduct comprehensive feasibility testing and determine whether the game influences behavioral
mediators of engagement in care and sexual risk avoidance and reduction (including knowledge, attitudes,
behavioral intentions, and self-efficacy); and (3) (R21/R33) To strengthen the capacity of the established
multidisciplinary team to conduct mHealth, specifically serious games for health, research in sSA. Our Secondary
Aims are: (1) To provide preliminary data on the game’s impact on viral load, engagement in care, and sexual
risk avoidance and reduction. (2) Through analysis of outcome data and game paradata, to identify the game
components and theoretical constructs that mediated intervention effects.
 The proposed intervention holds promise to be highly scalable, cost-effective, and culturally adaptable to
other settings. By advancing the evidence and theory base, addressing challenges to uptake through motivating
pedagogy, assessing safety for a vulnerable population, attending to potential future dissemination, and building
capacity for mHealth research in sub-Saharan Africa, the study shows promise to advance global mHealth."

The burden mental, neurological, and substance (MNS) disorders in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs)
is tremendous, but solutions for addressing the MNS burden remain limited in global adolescent mental health
research. The rapid growth and widespread use of technology has the potential to address MNS burden by
offering new solutions for transforming services; however, e-Health has not been systematically studied for
preventive mental health intervention in LMICs. This proposed two-phase R21/R33 study seeks to respond to
the growing burden of adolescent MNS disorders and urgent preventive service needs in LMIC by testing
usability, feasibility (R21 phase) and effectiveness (R33 phase) of a mHealth intervention, mHealth Toolkit for
Screening & Empowering Lives of Youth (mSELY), to promote adolescent mental health in Kenya. The
mSELY is a preventive intervention tool to be used by adolescents and/or their caregivers as a self-help
support modality. The mSELY-A is designed for adolescents and mSELY-P is designed for parents/caregivers.
The mSELY integrates 4 key mental health service functions: i) comprehensive screening for adolescent
social-emotional/mental health and relevant risks (in multiple RDoC domains); ii) a strength and weakness
profile for an adolescent’s behaviors; iii) tailored mental health literacy and promotion strategies, and iv)
tailored referral resources. To promote accessibility and to have broader reach, the mSELY will be embedded
in diverse community based organizations (CBOs) that already provide services to adolescents. In addition, a
youth empowerment approach of task-shifting will be applied to train a team of adolescent-peer-community-
health workers (A-CHWs) to support the mSELY implementation. This project is conceptualized within the
Social Action Theory, mHealth/Technology Acceptance Model, and Implementation Outcomes Framework.
The specific aims are: (1) to build research and service capacity for digital and public health approaches of
adolescent mental health promotion; (2) to employ a user-centered design to test and enhance usability of the
mSELY-A and P (in R21 Year 1) and to test feasibility and efficacy of mSELY-A alone, mSELY-P alone, and
combination of mSELY-A + P in youth-served CBOs; (3) to test the effectiveness of the optimized versions of
mSELY-A and P using a cluster-randomized control trial (cRCT); and 4) to disseminate and explore big data
analytic approaches using the Toolkit data to improve Digital-Toolkit decision support functions and accuracy
of mental health precision care."
10898752,"Project Summary / Abstract
Patients who suffer from debilitating neuromuscular disorders (e.g. amyotrophic lateral sclerosis – ALS, Locked-
in-Syndrome – LIS, and muscular dystrophies/myopathies) have difficulty or an inability to communicate through
speech leading to a detrimental loss in quality of life. Current technology using eye movements and
signals/spellers from electroencephalography (EEG) are slow and inconsistent. Neural prostheses offer an
opportunity to produce fast and accurate communication for patients suffering from neuromuscular disorders,
but success for regaining speech has been limited due to technological limitations: there is an inability to capture
the high dimensionality of the brain and an inability to record in naturalistic conditions using fully implanted,
wireless electrode arrays. To solve these challenges, we develop and optimize custom wireless micro-
electrocorticographic (µECoG) arrays with over 1,000 channels to decode speech directly from the human brain.
We will accomplish this by 1) Testing and optimizing the spatial resolution of µECoG to capture neural signals,
2) Fine-tune our machine learning algorithms to decode speech directly from the brain and 3) developing wireless
technology to enable neural prosthetic usage in naturalistic settings. High-density, high channel-count neural
interfaces will offer an unprecedented ability to decode speech from the human brain. This ability combined with
wireless technology, will allow for a new generation of speech neural prostheses."

West Baltimore is comprised of majority minority communities that are among the most economically and
academically disadvantaged in the US and are disproprotionately impacted by cancer. A healthcare and cancer
research workforce that understands the challenges facing West Baltimore residents and similar communities
across the US is essential to addressing cancer incidence and outcome disparities. To excite and sustain
underrepresented minorities (URM) scholars’ interest in cancer-related science subjects, healthcare research
and careers, early educational intervention that takes account of the social determinants of educational success
is critical. In this Catalyzing Cancer Research among Urban Underrepresented Minority Youths and Teachers
(CATALYST) program, we will implement an innovative and immersive program for Middle School scholars, their
families, teachers, and communities in West Baltimore.
The aims of the program are to: 1) Excite scholars, their families, and communities about cancer research using
cancer-focused research experiences and mentoring programs from an early stage in their education. 2) Develop
novel curricula and individually mentored, hands-on cancer research training and experiences for Baltimore Mid-
dle School teachers that are aligned with scholars’ curriculum and lead to improved science learning. 3) Develop
and implement novel scholars’ curricula integrated with research experiences to improve science learning in
Middle Schools. And 4) Expand the rich tapestry of outreach and community engagement activities to include
cancer-related research trainings in West Baltimore’s Middle Schools. Scholars and teachers’ projects will pro-
vide cancer-focused material for use in community outreach and engagement activities to be implemented by
the scholars and teachers in their schools and communities. The outcomes of scholars’ and teachers’ educa-
tional activities, curriculum development, and research projects will be published in peer-reviewed journals and
presented at local, regional, and national forums as well as during collaborative exchanges with peer NCI YES
programs across the US.
CATALYST is built on the highly successful University of Maryland Baltimore Continuing Umbrella of Research
Experiences (UMB CURE) Middle Schools Pilot Program – the first NCI CURE Middle School program – which
was implemented by the University of Maryland Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center (UMGCCC) in
West Baltimore for seven years. The UMB CURE pilot developed a robust cancer-focused program that lever-
aged strong UMB and UMGCCC resources in a holistic approach to scholars’ education, and community's needs,
and is the framework for the proposed CATALYST program. The impact of CATALYST on all program stake-
holders will be rigorously evaluated and outcomes will be longitudinally tracked. This data will inform best prac-
tices and identify areas for improvement which is fed back to develop a sustainable and scalable program that
produces the next generation of URM cancer researchers and caregivers and ultimately increase diversity in the
biomedical workforce."

Although cardiovascular disease (CVD) has traditionally been regarded as a higher risk condition in men, it is
also the leading cause of death in women. The impact of sex and gender on the pathophysiology of CVD has
emerged as an important clinical issue but its molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. The intersection
of sex, gender and CVD is underscored by recent observations that transgender individuals undergoing gender
affirming sex hormone therapy (GHT) are at increased CVD risk. Sex-differentiation of insulin resistance, a
major CVD risk factor, may underlie these observations since insulin resistance arises from adipose, a sexually
dimorphic tissue that is highly susceptible to sex hormones. Unfortunately, options to treat insulin resistance-
mediated CVD risk in a sex- and gender-relevant fashion are limited particularly in women. For example,
thiazolidinediones (TZDs), the only pharmacologic class that specifically targets insulin resistance in adipose,
increase the risk of osteoporotic fractures in post-menopausal women. A molecular understanding of the roles
of chromosomal sex, sex hormones and gender on the development of insulin resistance is needed to enhance
screening and develop new therapeutic options for CVD in women and transgender individuals.
One approach to identifying the molecular determinants of insulin resistance specifically operational in women
is to conduct genetic association studies (GWAS) of insulin resistance stratified by sex. However, isolating the
relative impacts of chromosomal sex, sex hormones, and gender and establishing a mechanistic relationship
between phenotype and identified genetic variants remains a major challenge.
Here, we propose to:
1) Utilize an integrative genomic approach by leveraging the natural “crossover” experiment between sex
chromosomes, hormones and gender that occurs in transwomen and men undergoing GHT; and
2) Directly test the impact of perturbing putatively causal genes on CVD risk in women by using high
throughput assays for insulin resistance to functionally characterize protein-coding genetic variants identified in
273,000 women.
This work will systematically identify sex- and gender-specific insulin resistance genes and for several top-
ranked genes, assess the clinical effect on CVD in women by relating genetic variants to function to
phenotype."

 The use of prescription stimulants in adults has increased dramatically, with a five-fold increase in use
of amphetamines between 2004 and 2019. Coinciding with increased prescribing of stimulants, there has been
an acceleration of fatal overdoses involving illicit psychostimulants. During the COVID-19 pandemic, stimulant-
related fatal overdoses reached the highest point on record, with 20,054 fatal overdoses involving cocaine and
23,352 involving methamphetamine in 2020 alone. While it is well-established that rising rates of prescription
opioid use was associated with an increase in heroin use in turn fueling increases in fatal overdoses, it is not
yet known if rising prescription stimulant use is associated with transition to illicit stimulants and overdoses
involving illicit stimulants. This is of critical importance given high rates of fentanyl contamination in the illicit
stimulant supply and counterfeit stimulant pills obtained from illegitimate online pharmacies.
 In addition to potential harmful effects, there are also some RCT’s suggesting prescription stimulants
may promote short-term abstinence in individuals with pre-existing substance use disorders. Whether these
benefits translate to reductions in overdose is unknown. The current application will fill a critical gap by using
real-world evidence to identify the consequences of prescription stimulant use on drug overdoses. Our
multidisciplinary research team will use robust real-world data sources linking prescription drug monitoring
program data, state-wide all-payer claims data, emergency medical service data, emergency department visit
and hospital discharge data, substance abuse treatment data and vital records (death certificate/toxicology) for
~ 10 million individuals from two states, Massachusetts and Oregon.
 In response to the NIDA program announcement RFA-DA-22-037 “Accelerating the Pace of Drug
Abuse Research Using Existing Data, we will address three aims: 1) We will use a priori definition of high
risk use, supported by preliminary data, to define the impact of high risk prescription stimulant use on the risk
of fatal and non-fatal overdoses involving stimulants and/or polysubstance use; 2) We will assess the potential
therapeutic role of prescription stimulants in preventing drug overdoses in individuals with stimulant and opioid
use disorders; and 3) We will use group-based trajectory modeling to identify longitudinal stimulant prescribing
patterns that may aid in predicting overdose. Aim 3 complements the other aims by capturing heterogeneity in
prescribing patterns that may be associated with protective or increased risk of overdose.
 Given prescription stimulants are one of the most widely prescribed classes of medications in the
United States, it is imperative to understand the risks/benefits of these medications with the overall goal of
reducing stimulant-related overdose."
10861007,"Neurocritical care (NCC) is the final frontier in pediatric critical care medicine (PCCM). The most common
cause of death in infants and children admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) is neurological system
failure and the prevalence of neuromorbidities causing cognitive impairment and reducing quality of life
remains unacceptably high. This T32 research training program “Pediatric Neurointensive Care and
Resuscitation Research,” established in 2000, represents a unique national program. It trains MDs, PhDs, and
MD/PhDs in basic, translational, or clinical research, from seven departments that treat infants and children
who require NCC across the continuum of care, from the field to the emergency department, the PICU, and to
rehabilitation and recovery. Our Specific Aim is to mentor clinicians, specifically fellows in PCCM, Child
Neurology, Neurosurgery, PM&R, Emergency Medicine, Newborn Medicine and Radiology along with
postdoctoral PhD scientists, in research training focused predominantly around two insults, traumatic brain
injury and cardiac arrest. Those two conditions are the leading contributors to pediatric NCC in the developed
world. We feature the unique and formidable resources of the Safar Center for Resuscitation Research and the
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh in the University of Pittsburgh School
of Medicine to create a highly collaborative, multi-disciplinary and multi-departmental culture for research
training. Our program has a carefully orchestrated research training infrastructure that has been further refined
to include three focus tracks (basic, translational, and clinical science), each with shared and unique
components. It features a choice of cutting-edge projects from 24 nationally recognized mentors, and offers
opportunities to obtain advanced degrees or take targeted courses to enhance career development. In this
outstanding environment trainees work to attain five goals 1) an education grounded in the sound principles of
contemporary neuroscience, 2) that they become academic clinician-scientists or scientists, 3) that they go on
to obtain independent funding, 4) that they ultimately become leaders in the field, and 5) that they are fully
equipped to rigorously and ethically study and successfully develop novel neuroprotective, resuscitative, and
regenerative therapies, and improve neuro-outcomes across all of pediatric NCC. Trainees are supported for
two or three years. Those targeted for faculty positions in Pittsburgh write K award applications. However,
given the National need for trained investigators in pediatric NCC research, our T32 is not designed simply to
create local talent. Our trainees have not only developed into independently funded investigators in Pittsburgh,
but have become National leaders in the field, independently funded investigators at other centers, site PIs for
NIH-funded trials, directors of NCC programs, and promoted and/or Endowed faculty. Our success is also
highlighted by our nine junior faculty “Future Mentors,” who are funded by R21 or K awards and serve as
outstanding exemplars of success in our field, to help guide our new trainees."
10894942,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Youth with HIV and adherence struggles stand to benefit from long-acting antiretrovirals (LAARV), soon to be
available in the U.S., more than other groups. Youth living with HIV between 13 and 29 years of age are less
engaged in all steps of the HIV care cascade, resulting in exaggerated HIV-related disparities in health and an
low rates of overall viral suppression in this group. Stigma, mental health issues, deficits in cognition and
executive functioning, and obstacles within multiple categories of social determinants of health can hamper
youths’ ability to sustain antiretroviral adherence and reap the benefits of this technology for themselves, their
families, and their social networks and communities. The primary goal of this project, nested within the funded
trial International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials Group (IMPAACT) 2022, is to develop an
independent scholarly research program addressing the optimization of the use of LAARV in youth, with the
ultimate goal of designing practical interventions to maximize their benefit. This four-year training and research
program will consist of: 1) employing novel methods to understand the role of biopsychosocial and cognitive
factors in the success of LAARV and potentially establish predictors of the efficacy of LAARV based on various
pre-use characteristics in youth; 2) developing and piloting novel bioassays to enable in-the-field collections of
Dried Blood Spot (DBS) or Dried Plasma Extractor (DPE) LAARV measurements for use in clinical trials or as
therapeutic drug monitoring among YLHIV receiving LAARV; and 3) Learning and leveraging population PK
modelling approaches to understand the sources of PK variability in YHIV on LAARV. The training will include
formal coursework, direct mentoring, and guided practice-based experience with new methodologies in
biostatistics, cognitive neuroscience, quantitative pharmacology and assay development, and advanced
population pharmacokinetics. By gaining training from her mentors and collaborators in all these methods, Dr.
Weld will establish herself as a clinician-researcher in long-acting infectious disease therapeutics equipped to
assess new delivery strategies and technologies as they emerge, and capable of transforming her field.
Results of the investigations conducted during the award period will establish a foundation for the subsequent
design of interventional studies to improve HIV-related outcomes in youth with less-frequent dosing strategies,
and submission of further funding proposals to support this line of inquiry."

Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) of pregnant women with ampicillin (AMP) to prevent neonatal group B
Streptococcus (GBS) disease has had a major impact to reduce infection-associated morbidity and mortality in
the immediate newborn period over recent decades. However, with this reduced incidence of early-onset GBS
disease, antibiotic exposure has the potential to cause significant collateral damage by perturbing the infant gut
microbiota and its developing immune system. Breast milk, conversely, supplies the infant with oligosaccharides
that possess unique immune-modulatory (and sometimes antimicrobial) properties beneficial for shaping the
development of a normal gut microbiome. Current pediatric guidelines that recommend the use of AMP for GBS
prophylaxis and the appropriate duration of breastfeeding are now receiving significant new attention because
of their clear impacts upon the health of the infant accrued through changes, deleterious or beneficial, on the
development of a healthy microbiome and infant immune system. Co-PIs Victor Nizet and George Liu of this
Basic Science Project entitled “The impact of Ampicillin and Breast Milk Oligosaccharides on the Infant
Microbiome and Immune Functions” are pediatric physician-scientists large and successful translational
research programs built around GBS and related bacterial pathogens, antibiotic therapeutics and host immune
responses. This current proposal will apply experimental mouse models in which the labs have long standing
expertise to provide key mechanistic insights in this highly novel area of maternal-infant clinical pharmacology.
Namely, we will be studying the novel aspects of toxicology or adverse impact of empiric prophylactic antibiotic
therapy given to (millions of) mothers during pregnancy, or alternatively, to the infant afterbirth for empiric
treatment of suspected sepsis. These antibiotic exposures reduce risk of infection, but simultaneously affect the
infant microbiome and metabolome in both the short and long term, likely impacting subsequent immune
responses of the infant to infections and vaccinations. Our overarching hypothesis is that AMP, given
prophylactically to the mother or empirically to the infant, has a measurable detrimental effect on infants’ gut
microbiome and developing immune system, and consequently adversely affect the infant’s subsequent
response to bacterial infections and vaccines and the clinical pharmacology of later antibiotic administration.
Conversely, we hypothesize that maternal milk oligosaccharides (MMO) provide a benefit to the infant by
improving the resilience of the gut microbiome, consequently mitigating the antibiotic adverse effects, and
improving subsequent response to GB S infections and pneumococcal and hepatitis B vaccine responses.
Successful completion of this Basic Science Project will help determine the benefits and adverse effects of
antibiotics and MMOs on the infant microbiome and immune system and further inform the appropriateness of
current GBS antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines and recommendations for the length of breastfeeding."

Proton therapy (PT) is a form of radiation therapy used to treat prostate cancer patients that can be an
alternative to surgery. While PT is thought to risk less toxicity than conventional radiation therapy, much about
PT is still not understood. To help serve their local area of tidewater Virginia, which has one of the highest
rates of prostate cancer in the world, especially in African-Americans, Hampton University (HU), a Historically
Black University, has opened the Hampton University Proton Therapy Institute. To help build the research
capacity at HU, leveraging their clinical expertise in proton therapy, the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount
Sinai (ISMMS) and HU propose this joint project aimed at developing a noninvasive biomarker for response to
PT. The team at ISMMS will bring their expertise in genomics and exosome profiling, a noninvasive way to
measure particles that are thought to shed from the tumor, to this project and in the process help build the
research capacity at HU. The research goal of this project is to determine changes in the exosomal RNA
(exoRNA) profile of exosomes taken from prostate cancer patients before and after radiotherapy with PT. All
aims of the study use patient samples collected at the HUPTI by the HU team. In aim 1, we will ask if an
exosomal signature of radical prostatectomy shows similar changes before and after PT. In aim 2, to
determine if there are specific changes in the mRNA profile in response to PT, we will globally profile RNA
isolated from exosomes before and after PT. In aim 3, to continue to build this project in preparation for a
future collaborative R01 submission, we will recruit additional patients from HUPTI to this study and obtain
blood specimens before, during, and after PT. At the end of the study time period, our scientific achievement
will have been to determine what changes in the RNA profile of exosomes can be observed in response to PT.
This will be important preliminary data demonstrating the utility of exosomes for noninvasive monitoring of PT.
More importantly, through this collaborative partnership between ISMMS and HU, we will have enhanced the
research infrastructure of HU in a way that will allow HU to pursue further research both jointly with ISMMS and
independently building on their clinical expertise in proton therapy."
10907657,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This data science project proposal seeks to utilize innovative methods in untargeted
metabolomics and microbiome analysis to study the effect of maternal antibiotic exposure in
breastfeeding infants. When breastfeeding mothers are taking antibiotics for common infections,
the infant's microbiome and their metabolism may be affected. This could have long-term
consequences on the infant's overall health because of the important role of the microbiome in
health and disease. It can be difficult to monitor drug effects in infants because of their low
blood volume and the invasiveness of blood draws. We have been able to non-invasively
monitor drugs in skin using skin swabs. We think this may be an important new way to monitor
drugs in infants. The three areas to be investigated in this project are:
Aim 1: Monitor infant antibiotic exposure levels through breast milk by monitoring the
skin metabolome using non-invasive swabs. We will test skin from breast milk fed infants
whose mothers were given antibiotics, breast milk fed infants whose mothers were not given
antibiotics, and infants who are not breast fed whose mothers were given antibiotics from
Project 1. Untargeted metabolomics and molecular networking will be used to detect antibiotics
and their metabolites in skin.
Aim 2: Determine the impact of antibiotic exposure through breast milk on the infant
microbiome, metabolome and metabolic transformation capacity.
Infant fecal samples obtained from Project 1 will be analyzed for changes in the microbiome due
to antibiotics from the mother. We will compare how the four different antibiotics given in the
clinical study affect the infant microbiome and metabolome.
Aim 3: Elucidate the gut metabolic transformations in infant mice from direct or indirect
(via maternal treatment or breastfeeding) exposure to ampicillin and investigate if host
cytochrome P450 (CYP) activities are altered. Mouse samples obtained from Project 2 will
be analyzed using new data science applications to determine the effect of ampicillin through
breast milk on the infant's metabolism throughout the intestine and the liver including the
cytochrome P450 drug metabolizing enzymes (Cyp). We will also have the targeted analysis of
ampicillin in breast milk from our Pharmacometrics and Analytical Chemistry Core and the
breast milk analysis from the Milk Analytics Core to complement our untargeted approaches.
We will also assess the effect of ampicillin on Cyp activity in the mouse intestine and liver."
10925190,"PROJECT SUMMARY: TRAINING AND EDUCATION PROGRAM
 While minority faculty in the clinical and translational sector may provide an innovative perspective from
which we identify problems disproportionately plaguing populations of color, they often lack the research
capacity needed to both rigorously evaluate the causal predictors of these problems and identify mechanistic
modes of intervention for the elimination of health disparities. Moreover, minority investigators encounter major
barriers to successful competition for federal research funding, which include but are not limited to: inadequate
research training, a lack of opportunities for professional development, insufficient mentorship, and inadequate
support for research focused on minority populations (Shavers, 2005).
 Thus, in response to PAR-18-911, our goal is to partner with Hampton University (HU) faculty in order
to provide hybrid training and education to increase HU research capacity in the area of cancer genomics and
health disparities, while also providing a rigorous curriculum in introductory and advanced biostatistics and
data science, clinical genome science, epidemiology, community-engaged research, health disparities
research, and clinical research methods. The curriculum will be administered through online asynchronous and
synchronous lectures coupled with intensive on-site training sessions in Years 2 through 4 of the proposed
four-year partnership. Our objectives are to: 1) successfully implement the online cancer genomics research
training and education program; 2) design and successfully implement the on-site research training education
program; and 3) conduct a rigorous evaluation of the impact of the proposed training and education program
on building research capacity and increasing research engagement and productivity. Additionally, HU will be
providing extensive insight and guidance to help foster a culture of inclusion, diversity, and equity among
members of the ISMMS research workforce through a series of in-person and virtual lectures.
 In summary, we are confident that our proposed, comprehensive, online and on-site training and
education program will increase the competitive success of federal grant submissions by HU faculty for cancer
health disparities genomics research projects, while also providing them with an optimal skill-set that they can
disseminate to the larger HU community of faculty and students."
10907659,"PROJECT SUMMARY for MPRINT CET ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
The primary goal of the UCSD MPRINT CET is to serve as a national resource for knowledge and expertise in
maternal and pediatric pharmacology. The Multi-PI leadership of the UCSD MPRINT CET, who will lead three

The University of California San Diego (UC San Diego) MPRINT Center of Excellence in Therapeutics (CET)
involves a human milk (HM)-centered approach to investigate the role of maternal and pediatric therapeutics at
intersections of the mother-milk-infant ‘triad’. Key among the overall goals of the MPRINT CET are to assess
how maternal antibiotics impact HM composition and how HM components alter safety and efficacy of these
important pediatric therapeutic agents. HM composition analysis, however, is not trivial. HM composition is highly
dynamic and changes throughout lactation, indeed even throughout the course of a single feeding. HM is a
complex matrix that includes cells and microbes as well as large molecule aggregates like the milk fat globule.
HM also contains a unique set of molecules, the human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), which represent the third
most abundant component of HM after lactose and lipids. Thus, the dynamic, complex, and unique nature of HM
requires specific collection protocols, assay development, and assay validation. With over 20 years of experience
in HM research, the Milk Analytics Core (MAC) will provide overall guidance and advice to MPRINT CET
investigators and staff. MAC will provide HM collection protocols and ready-to-ship sample collection kits to the
Clinical and Data Science Projects (Aim 1a) and receive HM samples for composition analysis (Aim 1b).
Depending on project needs, MAC offers macronutrient, oligosaccharide, and bioactive measurements as well
as milk microbiome analysis, the latter in collaboration with the UC San Diego Microbiome Core, which operates
independently of, but frequently in partnership with, our team. MAC will also provide mouse milk oligosaccharide
and microbiome analyses to the Research Project team (Aim 1c), applying our detailed prior knowledge of how
the St3gal4 mutation under study markedly depletes sialylated milk oligosaccharide content. Data generated
from our analyses will be returned to the respective project teams for integration. Separate HM aliquots from the
same samples will be passed directly on to the Pharmacometrics and Analytical Chemistry Core for antibiotic
drug quantification, and that data will likewise be directly returned to the respective project teams. In addition to
already established services, MAC will develop and validate new HM-specific assays by expanding the analyte
portfolio of the existing multiplex immunoassay platform (Aim 2a) and by engaging and activating other UC San
Diego researchers to apply and validate their unique technologies to HM research (Aim 2b). We envision MAC
to become a comprehensive milk analytics core with knowledge, skills, and technology, serving as a resource to
this and other MPRINT CETs and the biomedical research community at large. Together, we will be able to
generate a better understanding how antibiotic treatment during pregnancy and lactation impacts the mother-
milk-infant ‘triad’, inform and adjust precision in therapeutics, and ultimately improve maternal-child health."
10896418,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Background. Pathogenic bacteria must travel through the highly acidic environment of the stomach before
they can reach and infect the intestines. The stomach is therefore an important barricade which helps to kill
many bacteria before they can cause illness. In some of the most infectious bacteria, however, ATP-
independent chaperones HdeA and HdeB play major roles in aiding bacterial survival at low pH. Their job is to
protect other proteins from misfolding and aggregating as the cell transitions through the harsh environment of
the stomach and into the neutral environment of the intestines. HdeB is active at intermediate pH values, while
HdeA functions at the low pH typical of stomach acid. Although there are various models available to explain
the interplay between the two chaperones, it is still unclear which, if any, is correct.
Specific aims. The goal of the proposed work is to use NMR spectroscopy and other biophysical techniques
to pursue an in-depth investigation of the apparently synergistic mechanism by which the two chaperone
proteins operate and to probe the roles of specific residues that trigger or modify the activation of HdeA or
HdeB. Aim #1 is to examine the roles and interactions of HdeA and HdeB with chaperone clients as a function
of pH. Isotopic labeling and the unique properties of NMR spectroscopy will be employed to monitor each
protein individually within a mixture of HdeA, HdeB and a client protein, thereby providing different vantage
points to obtain unprecedented detail. Aim #2 is to probe sites of chaperone activation and stability in HdeA
and HdeB using targeted mutations. Here, a variety of techniques will be used to closely assess segments of
each protein that have been linked to essential roles in function and/or activation, including a key tryptophan in
the dimer interface of HdeB and the disulfide bond in HdeA, which helps to maintain the semi-folded structure
believed to be important to its chaperone function.
Health-related significance. Dysentery, caused by intestinal infection by pathogenic bacteria, kills at least
350,000 people per year worldwide. If we can elucidate the individual and collective roles of HdeA and HdeB in
the presence of client proteins, as well as the mechanistic importance of specific residues or regions, we can
better understand how these acid-stress chaperones help bacteria survive under extreme conditions. Improved
understanding can inform researchers designing vaccines or other therapeutics that can disable the activities
of HdeA and HdeB and thereby weaken the infectivity of these pathogenic bacteria."
10710390,"The focus of this study is to improve walking symmetry in order to optimize walking ability and reduce disability
for Veterans with non-traumatic lower limb amputation (LLA). Over 80% of current LLAs are non-traumatic,
resulting from complications of pathologies, such as diabetes mellitus and peripheral artery disease. Despite
current declines in total amputation rate among Veterans, the population with non-traumatic LLA is growing.
For example, from 2000 to 2004 the relative amputation rate decreased by 34%. However, due to an increase
in the number of Veterans with diabetes during the same period, the population of Veterans with diabetes and
initial LLA increased by 23%. Following LLA, excessive gait asymmetry is common. Asymmetric gait
characteristics are of critical importance as excessive asymmetry may increase the severity of disability
experienced by people with non-traumatic LLA and contribute to secondary pain conditions (low back pain and
osteoarthritis), poor gait efficiency, declines in physical performance, and compromised skin integrity of the
residual limb. Compared to individuals with traumatic LLA, the poor gait performance of those with non-
traumatic LLA is further compounded by older age, lower premorbid function, presence of comorbidities,
frequent wound development, and delayed healing in the residual limb. While improving gait symmetry is a
goal of conventional prosthetic rehabilitation, persistence of gait asymmetry for years after LLA highlights the
ineffectiveness of current rehabilitation practices in achieving this goal. As a means of improving gait
symmetry, this study aims to determine the efficacy of error-manipulation gait training using two approaches
(error-augmentation and error-correction) compared to current standard-of-care in a three-arm randomized
controlled trial. Error-manipulation gait training intervention will be delivered in eight training sessions (2x/week,
4 weeks) with 54 Veterans (18 per intervention group, 18 in control group) who have non-traumatic, unilateral,
transtibial LLA. It is unclear which, if either, form of error-manipulation gait training is efficacious for improving
persistent gait symmetry in Veterans with non-traumatic LLA. Error-augmentation gait training is a promising
and novel intervention that involves exaggerating an existing movement error to force the neuromuscular
system to correct the error. While this form of gait training improved gait symmetry in small studies of
individuals with chronic stroke or traumatic amputation, it has yet to be evaluated in older Veterans with non-
traumatic LLA. In contrast, error-correction training involves reducing movement errors by overcorrecting for
asymmetry. Both error-augmentation and error-correction gait training are based upon motor learning
principles of distributed practice, task specificity, and feedback. Each of these error-manipulation interventions
have potential advantages over traditional gait training following LLA which involves repeated bouts of walking
with minimal feedback on movement quality and is often unsupervised. Therefore, the primary aim of this study
is to determine the efficacy of error-manipulation gait training to improve gait symmetry. A secondary aim is to
evaluate signals of efficacy for improved secondary measures of physical function. Lastly, this study will
explore changes to residual limb skin health and prosthesis socket fit following error-manipulation gait training.
The unique use of motor learning principles in error-manipulation gait training to improve gait symmetry
addresses the problem of chronic gait asymmetry following non-traumatic LLA. The results of this study will
advance rehabilitation knowledge and provide necessary evidence for the clinical translation of gait training
protocols based in motor learning principles for the at-risk population of Veterans with non-traumatic LLA."

longevity of life for many American Indian and Alaska Native (Indigenous) communities. The proposed
Community-Driven Indigenous Research, Cultural Strengths & Leadership to Advance Equity in Substance Use
Outcomes (CIRCLE) Center of Excellence (P50) aims to address drug use related health problems in
collaboration with diverse Indigenous communities. Through research, training, and outreach, we will respond to
calls from Indigenous Peoples for enhanced focus on recovery and prevention, sources of strength, culture and
family-based approaches to wellness, and policy solutions. The P50 projects and cores will operate with
emphasis on four cross-cutting domains, all centered on a bedrock of promoting Indigenous Health Equity: 1)
Indigenous & Allied Leadership; 2) Community/Tribally Based Participatory Research (C/TBPR); 3) Addressing
Heterogeneity via Precision Public Health; and 4) Centering Strengths, including Assessing Indigenous Cultural
Frameworks of Health. Reflecting these thematic approaches, the Center's overarching aims include conducting
impact-focused, C/TBPR to identify heterogeneity in substance use risk and protective factors and intervention
effects. We will also foster the development of Indigenous scholars to expand Indigenous autonomy, capacity
and innovation in research, practice, and policy surrounding alcohol and drug use. We further aim to expand and
deepen our engagement with educational facilities, researchers, Tribal and Urban Native communities, policy
makers, and the public to serve as a national resource for more rapid uptake and sharing of novel methods,
measures, and programs in service to Indigenous health equity. To achieve these goals, the Center will house
the following: 1) Administrative Core to oversee governance, administrative structures, scientific priorities, and
training activities; 2) Research Core to provide methodological expertise to support the research of the Center;
3) Pilot Project Core to support innovation in Indigenous drug use research, and 4) Three Research Projects that
will conduct multidisciplinary and synergistic science focused on drug use prevention, intervention, and policy.
The proposed work aligns with NIDA's Racial Equity Initiative action steps, including increased CBPR and equity-
driven partnerships to combat drug use inequities."
10898737,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cannabis use among older adults is on an unprecedented rise, yet relatively little is known about its possible
harms and whether findings of sex differences in cannabis use that have been identified in adolescent and young
adults extend to this population. To date, preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that women are more
likely to use cannabis for stress reduction and have increased cannabis craving after stress compared to men.
Ovarian hormones have been identified as potential mechanisms of these stress-related disparities, but whether
hormonal changes in mid-to-late life influence cannabis use is unknown. Furthermore, while the effects of heavy
cannabis use on cognition have been extensively studied in emerging and young adults, it is unknown whether
cannabis affects age-related cognitive decline and risk for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD)
and if stress is implicated, given that stress response also confers risk for ADRD. Coupled with the possible
effects of age-related loss of ovarian hormones on ADRD risk, the extant literature has led us to propose the
overall hypothesis that older women may be at greater risk of the adverse effects of regular cannabis use than
men. We therefore propose a cross-sectional study of 200 regular cannabis-using men and women ages 50-80
from whom we will collect behavioral and biological markers of cognitive function and ADRD risk, reproductive
history, ovarian hormones, and measures of chronic and acute stress. Our goals are to examine cognitive
function in cannabis-using older men and women (Aim 1), evaluate the impact of stress on cannabis use and
cognitive functioning in older adults (Aim 2), and examine the impact of ovarian hormones on cognitive
functioning, stress, and cannabis craving. The results from this project will be critical to devising a comprehensive
theoretical model of how cannabis impacts cognitive aging that can be empirically tested in a subsequent
longitudinal study. Findings may directly inform sex-specific public health messaging regarding cannabis use as
well as identify potential clinical interventions for older adults."
10898738,"Legalization and shifting societal views have contributed to increases in the use of recreational and medicinal
cannabis products in the general population, especially among vulnerable populations. Despite this increase,
there are significant gaps in our understanding of how sex and age contribute to Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD)
and the cognitive impacts of chronic cannabis exposure. Our goal in this preclinical component is to enhance
and inform Clinical Projects 1-3 by investigating numerous biological endpoints after Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) vapor self-administration in rats. Our project will assess these outcomes using
translationally relevant behavioral and biological assessments in several vulnerable groups that correspond to
the Clinical Projects: emerging young adults (Project 1), aged adults (Project 3), and pregnant females (Project
2). Our central hypothesis is that both sex and age confer unique neurobiological vulnerabilities to volitional
THC/CBD administration, resulting in different behavioral and molecular outcomes. To test this, we will assess
sex and age differences in THC/CBD intake, reinstatement to THC/CBD-associated cues, stress reactivity,
cognitive function, and the molecular footprint of THC/CBD in the brain across the 3 Aims. In all 3 Aims, we will
employ an ecologically valid model of rodent cannabis vapor self-administration (SA) to assess volitional
THC/CBD intake. In Aim 1, we will assess volitional THC vapor SA in adolescent male and female rats. We
expect that female rats will take more THC/CBD and relapse to a greater extent than males. In behavioral
assessments, we predict that females will exhibit enhanced stress reactivity, while males will have deficits in
spatial memory. In Aim 2, we will conduct a longitudinal assessment of volitional THC vapor SA across the
lifespan in aged adult male and female rats. We expect females to recapitulate differences in THC/CBD intake
and relapse as predicted in Aim 1. We also hypothesize that lifetime THC/CBD will negatively impact stress
reactivity and spatial memory in aged adults, relative to those only exposed when aged. For both Aims 1 and 2,
we expect that the biological endpoints collected from the hippocampus (lipids, RNA, protein) will reveal sex-,
and age-, and exposure duration-specific changes in several targets related to endocannabinoid signaling and
synaptic plasticity. Finally, in Aim 3, we will evaluate the impacts of volitional THC/CBD SA across the female
reproductive cycle (pre-pregnancy, pregnancy, postpartum) on maternal behavior and relapse. We predict that
THC/CBD SA will negatively impact maternal behavior. Furthermore, we will assess how pregnancy, and its
associated changes in progesterone levels, will impact THC/CBD SA. We expect that females will reduce
THC/CBD SA during gestation, inversely correlating with changes in progesterone, with a rebound increase in
SA postpartum. We also hypothesize that THC/CBD SA will induce changes in the prefrontal cortex related to
endocannabinoid signaling and synaptic plasticity. This project will significantly enhance our knowledge about
how sex and age interact with THC/CBD to impact the brain and behavior across several vulnerable populations."

The urinary bladder is a common source of visceral pain, one of the most frequent reasons why patients seek medical attention. Despite the primordial role that afferent pathways have in normal bladder sensation and nociception, we have limited understanding of the molecular events contributing to these processes. This proposal aims to understand the mechanisms by which acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) regulate bladder afferent signaling. The proposal builds on the findings that the loss of ASIC3 in naïve mice reduces the intravesical pressure required to trigger micturition, while in the setting of chemically-induced cystitis it results in the hyperactivation of nociceptive pathways and chronic pain. These findings are puzzling, because ASICs are presumably responsible for the transduction of extracellular pH transients into electrical signals at the peripheral terminal of bladder afferents. Our working hypothesis is that ASICs control afferent outflow by triggering spike adaptation. We posit that Na+ influx through ASICs initiates a cascade of events that results in the activation of small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK) channels and adaptation. Experiments proposed in Aim 1 will define whether ASICs regulate afferent firing through a mechanism mediated by Ca2+. To test our model, we will use sensory neuron conditional Asic3 knockout mice, Ca2+ imaging, patch-clamp analysis, single-unit recordings, and a collection of pharmacological tools. In Aim 2, we will evaluate whether ASICs and SK channels work in concert to control bladder afferent discharge during sustained stimulation. To assess this, we will use physiological tools in combination with genetic and pharmacological manipulations. Upon completion of these studies, we will have gained a thorough understanding of mechanisms that mediate the adaptation of visceral afferents."
10899466,"Although the exact mechanisms by which anesthetics induce unconsciousness remain unknown, there is
evidence that some anesthetics activate neural circuits regulating sleep and inhibit neural systems promoting
waking. Despite general anesthesia and sleep both activating a subset of seemingly similar, if not identical,
neurons, there are clear differences between the two unconscious states, including the degree of arousal
threshold changes and the timescale of state transition. The neural mechanisms underlying these related, yet
distinct unconscious states are poorly understood.
The parafacial zone (PZ) has recently been identified as a non-rapid-eye-movement (non-REM) sleep-promoting
region; specifically, GABAergic neurons in the PZ (PZ-GABA) are active during non-REM sleep. My preliminary
data demonstrate that PZ-GABA are also active during isoflurane exposure, and ablation of PZ-GABA increases
resistance to isoflurane. The results also suggest that non-GABAergic neurons within the PZ are also involved
in isoflurane-induced hypnosis. The overarching question asks how the neural circuitry driving distinct states
of non-REM sleep and isoflurane anesthesia converge and diverge by first examining in PZ-GABA neurons, and
then expanding beyond the PZ to consider all cell types in the medulla. It is hypothesized that these distinct
endogenous and drug-induced unconscious states are generated by partially overlapping shared circuits but that
key state differences arise from distinctive cellular activation patterns.
The three key questions we will address during this proposal are: 1) Does acute reversible activation/inhibition
of the PZ sleep-promoting neurons alter anesthetic sensitivity? 2) What is the cellular makeup of the PZ, and
which cells are activated during each unconscious state? and 3) What are the overlapping and different elements
between the brainstem neural circuits engaged during isoflurane exposure and those engaged during non-REM
sleep? These questions will be addressed by anesthetic and sleep phenotyping assays, the single-cell level
transcriptomic analysis by single nucleus RNA sequencing followed by multiplex in situ hybridization, and side-
by-side comparison of ensembles of active neurons by Targeted Recombination in Active Population (TRAP).
The proposed projects will uncover the underlying mechanism of how the brainstem neural circuits, including
PZ, mediate these two different unconscious states. Understanding how the brain controls states of
unconsciousness is vital for clinical practice. It can lead to more effective and safer somnogens and new potential
sedative hypnotic anesthetics that may one day be used for sleep disorders such as insomnia and narcolepsy."
10849892,"Project Summary
The objective of our work is to decipher how stromal cells interact with immune cells to alter tissue biology to
support resistance to an intestinal infection. Our work will use mice infected with the intestinal helminth
parasite Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri (Hp), which is a recognized inducer of type 2 immunity. In this
system, mice are resistant to reinfection following curative treatment of primary infection, and resistance is Th2
cell-dependent. We recently reported that during Hp infection mesenteric adipose tissue (mAT) becomes
populated by long-lived Th2RM cells which make Amphiregulin and TGFβ1 in addition to the signature Th2
cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, and that deletion of the Amphiregulin receptor on stromal cells is associated with
increased susceptibility to Hp. Further, stromal cells within mAT, and especially a subset of stromal cells with
multipotent potential (multipotent progenitor cells, MPC) to differentiate into fibroblasts or adipocytes, become
activated and makes the alarmins IL-33 and TSLP that are able to promote Th2 RM cell activation. We have
localized both Th2RM cells and MPC to interstitial spaces in mAT. We propose that mAT interacts with the
intestine to participate in the protective response against Hp. This involves the production of alarmins to
support Th2RM cell activity, and to produce extracellular matrix (ECM), which we postulate is important for
trapping invading parasites in granulomas, and supporting soft tissue integrity and repair during infection.
Based on our published findings and new preliminary data, we hypothesize that Th2RM cells and stromal cells
work as a team to mutually facilitate each other’s activation and exert host protective effects during Hp
infection. On the basis of our recently published findings and new preliminary data on innate training in MPC,
and lipid metabolism and motility of Th2RM cells, we have developed two Specific Aims: 1, To understand the
role of MPC in shaping host resistance to Hp; and 2, To determine the function, antigen specificity, and cell-
intrinsic metabolic and migratory features of mAT-resident Th2 cells. To address these Aims we will use RNA
seq, ATACseq, flow cytometry, parasitological techniques, advanced imaging of cell movement ex-vivo,
measurements of tissue stiffness, ex-vivo studies of the functional properties of Th2RM cells and stromal cells,
and in vivo loss of function models to probe the roles of Amphiregulin, TGFβ, IL-33 and TSLP. Our work has
the potential to reveal novel features of stromal cell biology that are integral to underlying effector mechanisms
of resistance and immunity to intestinal pathogens, and to highlight potential points of intervention for
manipulating stromal cell biology as it relates to type 2 immunity in health and disease. Our findings may have
relevance to understanding human conditions such as atopy/allergy, impaired wound healing, fibrosis and
cancer, in which dysregulated stromal cell biology and ECM production are implicated."
10884278,"The COVID-19 pandemic has historic implications on the health and wellbeing of families and
children. Starting in March of 2020, efforts to limit the spread of the virus has created
unprecedented challenges and stress to family functioning, including economic declines and job
loss, health risks, school closures and disruption to family routines, and increased domestic
violence and harsh parenting. Despite evidence indicating that COVID-19 increases rates of
interparental hostility and parent-child difficulties, little is known about the lasting effect of
COVID-19 on families, particularly how it may modulate the degree and nature of the
interdependencies between family relationships or subsystems in ways that modify family
functioning. Grounded in the theoretically rich conceptualizations of family systems and spillover
processes, this time-sensitive application seeks to explore how the extra-familial perturbations
associated with COVID-19 modify associations between interparental hostility and discord and
harsh, punitive parenting. This application builds on an existing dataset (Phase 1, N = 235
families) that was collected over a three-year period immediately prior to the onset of the
pandemic, and we propose to collect three additional waves of data post-onset of COVID-19.
The strength of this application involves the utilization of a quasi-experiment design with the
establishment of pre-COVID-baseline for family functioning, and both phases (six waves in total)
will utilize multi-method, multi-informant, and multi-level longitudinal design to assess ecological
contexts, family dynamics, parent and child characteristics, and parenting behaviors. This study
will elucidate how COVID-19 impacts spillover processes and may have enduring effects on
family functioning and advance new process-oriented approaches to understanding how
COVID-19 modulated spillover processes through mediating mechanism of parental
neurobiological and cognitive self-regulation. Furthermore, the present application will identify
the preexisting individual or ecological factors as well as COVID-19 related changes in family
functioning as risk or protective factors in the spillover processes. The results of this application
will have significant implications for understanding the ramifications of COVID-19 on family
functioning and have high potential to generate knowledge on targets for evidence-based
prevention programs."

Predisposition to AD involves a complex, polygenic, and pleiotropic genetic architecture; furthermore, there are
no disease modifying treatments that slow the neurodegenerative process for AD. Traditional reductionist
paradigms overlook the inherent complexity of AD and have often led to treatments that are lack of clinical
benefits or fraught with adverse effects. Existing multi-omics data resources, including genetics, genomics,
transcriptomics, interactomics (protein-protein interactions and chromatin interactions), have not yet been fully
utilized and integrated to explore the pathobiology and drug discovery for AD. Understanding AD genetics
and genomics from the point-of-view of how cellular systems and molecular interactome perturbations underlie
the disease (termed disease module) is the essence of network medicine. Systematic identification and
characterization of novel underlying pathogenesis and disease module, will serve as a foundation for identifying
and validating novel risk genes and drug targets in AD. Given our preliminary results, we posit that a genome-
wide, multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) framework to identify new risk genes and networks from human
genome/exome sequencing and multi-omics findings enable a more complete mechanistic understanding of AD
pathogenesis and the rapid development of targeted therapeutic intervention for AD with great success. Aim 1
will determine whether rare coding and non-coding variants by whole-genome/exome sequencing (WGS/WES)
are enriched in protein-functional and gene-regulatory regions using sequence and structure-based deep
learning models. These analyses will assemble WGS/WES and clinical data from Alzheimer's Disease
Sequencing Project (ADSP), publicly available protein structure (i.e., protein-protein interfaces, protein-ligand
binding sites, post-translational modifications) and sequence (expression quantitative trait locus [eQTLs],
histone-QTLs, and transcription factor binding-QTLs) information from the PDB database, GTEx, NIH RoadMap,
FANTOM5, PsychENCODE, and NIH 4D Nucleome. Aim 2 will determine whether GWAS common variants
linked to AD pathobiology and endophenotypes are enriched in gene regulatory networks in a cell-type specific
manner using a Bayesian framework. We will validate risk gene and network findings using WGS/WES and
protein panel expression data from our existing cohorts: The Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health
Aging and Neurodegenerative Disease Biobank (CBH-Biobank) and the Cleveland Alzheimer's Disease
Research Center (CADRC). Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that risk genes and networks can be modulated via
in silico drug repurposing, population-based validation, and functional test, to identify candidate agents and drug
combinations that will modify AD. The successful completion of this project will offer capable and intelligent
computer-based toolboxes that enable searching, sharing, visualizing, querying, and analyzing genetics,
genomics, and multi-omics profiling data for genome-informed therapeutic discoveries for AD and other
neurodegenerative disease if broadly applied."

 The human hand plays a critical role in performing many daily activities including self-feeding, tool use, and
recreation. Therefore, loss of the hand due to traumatic injury or disease can significantly limit or interfere with
the ability of persons with limb loss to perform daily activities and work, thus greatly affecting overall quality of
life. Despite advances in prosthetic hand design and research, several barriers to widespread acceptance of
prosthetic hands by persons with upper limb loss remain, including limited ability to perform daily activities and
poor durability of the prosthetic hand. Therefore, today’s commercially-available myoelectric hand prostheses
fail to address the needs of persons with limb loss, i.e., regaining some degree of autonomy, functionality, and
re-entry into the work force. To address these gaps, in the past few years we have investigated the extent to
which an artificial anthropomorphic hand originally designed for robotic grasping and manipulation – the
SoftHand – could be used for prosthetic applications through a non-invasive myoelectric controller – the
SoftHand Pro (SHP). The novel design of the SHP is the only prosthetic hand in the world that combines the
concept of human hand synergies and soft robotics technologies. The results of preliminary functional
assessments and biomechanical analyses revealed that individuals with upper limb loss could perform a
variety of grasping and manipulation tasks with the SHP at levels similar or superior to those of their preferred
prosthetic device. Additionally, subject surveys reported positive feedback about the ease and comfort
associated with using the SHP. This feedback was also instrumental in making software and hardware
improvements to make the hand lighter and able to grasp and manipulate small objects. We propose to
determine the extent to which the SHP can address three critical needs of transradial amputees that are not
met by commercially-available hand prostheses: function, versatility, and robustness. We will attain this
objective by comparing its function, versatility, and robustness with a commercially-available multi-digit
prosthetic hand, the i-limb (Ossur). We will pursue three aims: (1) to determine the extent to which
performance of grasping and manipulation tasks using the SHP is superior to the i-limb, (2) to determine the
extent to which daily use of the SHP and i-limb over an extended period of time improves grasping and
manipulation performance, and (3) to obtain SHP usage patterns and subjects’ satisfaction ratings from using
the SHP and i-limb. We will test the hypotheses that (1) the SHP will outperform the i-limb, and (2) daily use of
both prosthetic hands over an 8-week period each will lead to significantly greater improvement in grasping
and manipulation performance with the SHP than the i-limb. We will obtain usage and survey data collected
through the SHP and i-limb firmware during daily use to complement data obtained in Aims 1 and 2 to explore
daily use. This proposed work is significant because it will shed insight on whether an innovative soft synergy-
based prosthetic design allows for function, versatility and robustness not available in commercial prostheses."
10922002,"Project Summary
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss in working adults, affecting more than 100 million
people worldwide. A breakthrough in DR therapy is the advent and approval of vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) inhibitors as the first pharmacological treatment but with limited efficacy. Additionally, anti-VEGF therapy
indiscriminately inhibits both diseased and healthy vessels as well as neuronal function and may indirectly reduce
the efficacy to improve visual acuity. An unmet clinical need is to develop drug therapies against VEGF-
independent angiogenic factors for alternative or combination therapy to improve efficacy with optimal safety.
We recently discovered a novel disease-restricted pro-angiogenic factor that selectively binds to and stimulates
angiogenesis and vascular leakage of diabetic but not healthy vessels, whereas VEGF indiscriminately induces
angiogenesis and leakage. We further revealed that the new pro-angiogenic factor selectively binds to the DR-
stressed deep retinal vascular plexus with compromised endothelial junctions, but not the relatively healthy
superficial and intermediate retinal plexuses in diabetic mice with intact endothelial junctions. Therefore,
inhibition of this disease-restricted angiogenic factor may selectively target DR-stressed deep retinal plexus,
while sparing the relatively healthy superficial and intermediate vascular plexuses within the same diabetic retina.
To exploit this unique disease-targeted DR therapy, we generated neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and a
related humanized antibody (hAb) against the new angiogenic factor and demonstrated their high efficacy to
alleviate DR leakage in diabetic mice. We confirmed that the hAb stringently targets diseased but not healthy
vessels. More importantly, combination therapy simultaneously targeting VEGF and the new angiogenic factor
with distinct receptor signaling pathways synergistically improved the efficacy to ameliorate DR leakage. The
objective of this project is to complete all required preclinical studies for Investigational New Drug (IND)
application. In Aim 1, we will analyze IND-enabling pharmacokinetic studies and develop formulation and
bioanalytic assays. In Aim 2, we will submit a Pre-IND application to the FDA and seek the agency’s guidance
on relevant requirements for a formal IND application. In Aim 3, we will complete IND-enabling toxicology studies.
Successful implementation of the proposed studies will advance this first-in-class disease-targeted anti-
angiogenic therapy to IND application and clinical trials."
10908491,"Among people living with HIV (PLWH), heavy drinking increases the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and
death. Data suggest that alcohol-associated gut dysbiosis partially drives this risk. Whether interventions
targeting alcohol-associated gut dysbiosis among PLWH improve dysbiosis, lower levels of microbial
translocation, inflammation, and harmful metabolites (e.g., trimethylamine N-oxide [TMAO)]) is unknown. Our
hypothesis for this P01 application is that among PLWH, a probiotic can mitigate or reduce alcohol associated
gut dysbiosis and lower levels of microbial translocation, inflammation, and improve metabolite profiles (Project
1); and that harmful levels of these metabolites will be associated with higher CVD and death risk (Project 2).
Our team, with expertise in alcohol, HIV, gut microbiome, and biomarker research has conducted two NIAAA
funded trials, a metabolite study, and a gut microbiome study among Russian PLWH who are heavy drinkers.
Data from these studies show that among PLWH: (1) heavy drinking is associated with incident CVD, death
and gut dysbiosis (characterized by a reduction in butyrate producing bacteria); and (2) this gut dysbiosis is
associated with inflammation, altered bile acids, and high TMAO levels. Given these data and reports from pilot
studies showing that probiotics are safe, may improve gut dysbiosis and reduce inflammation among PLWH,
we propose an RCT among 250 PLWH with heavy alcohol consumption who are on antiretroviral therapy and
have CD4+ counts≥350 cells/mm3 to compare the effects of a probiotic tailored to alcohol associated gut
dysbiosis vs. placebo to: (1) improve GI dysbiosis; (2) reduce plasma metabolite (e.g., TMAO) and biomarker
levels of microbial translocation and inflammation; and (3) lower CVD and mortality risk. All participants will
receive evidenced-based counseling for alcohol use. Our specific aims will compare the effects of a
tailored probiotic vs. placebo at 6 months on (Aim 1) dysbiosis (fecal Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F/B)
ratio, primary study outcome; fecal Lachnospiraceae-family of butyrate producers) and plasma metabolites
(plasma butyrate, deoxycholic acid:cholic acid ratio, and TMAO) (Aim 2) biomarkers of inflammation (plasma,
IL-6, D-dimer, sCD14), microbial translocation [Lipopolysaccharide binding protein], (Aim 3) cardiovascular risk
(Reynolds risk score), mortality risk (VACS index); (Aim 4 exploratory) alcohol consumption (% heavy drinking
days in past month) and HIV disease progression (CD4 cell count). We hypothesize that as compared with
placebo, the probiotic arm will have significantly: (1) higher F/B ratio and levels of fecal Lachnospiraceae,
plasma butyrate, deoxycholic acid: cholic acid ratio and lower levels of TMAO; (2) lower plasma biomarker
levels of microbial translocation and inflammation; (3) lower Reynolds risk score and VACS index; (4) lower %
heavy drinking days in the past month and higher CD4 cell counts. The findings from this RCT, Microbiome,
mETabolites, and Alcohol in HIV to reduce CVD (META HIV CVD RCT), will inform probiotics' role as standard
adjunctive therapy complementing alcohol interventions among PLWH who are heavy drinkers."
10863937,"The mission of this MSTP at Cornell’s College of Veterinary Medicine (CVM) is (i) to create a diverse
and inclusive veterinary clinician and scientist community to support and mentor Combined DVM-PhD
Degree (CD) trainees along the axes of their personal identity, clinical discipline, and research domain;
(ii) to provide integrated training in clinical veterinary medicine and biomedical research that prepares
trainees to perform at the highest standards as rigorous clinician-scientists; (iii) to develop biomedical
science leaders exhibiting creativity, curiosity, compassion, and service; and (iv) to develop skills for
success in a broad range of veterinary clinician-scientist research careers through experiential learning.
Towards this mission, we have established a flexible and vibrant CD training plan that strategically and
uniquely pairs Cornell’s Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) curriculum with the graduate (PhD)
program in Biomedical and Biological Sciences (BBS). The current Cornell CD program has a strong
track record of ongoing success since its creation in 2002. Approximately 71% of our 24 CD graduates
are in research careers (33% in academia, 17% in government, and 21% in industry). Incoming CD
students will choose their PhD mentor, after their laboratory rotations, from a pool of 40 trainers
(including 4 affiliate trainers) representing 8 research specialties with an average of $900,000 of
research grant funding. Cornell is committed to providing all CD students, including MSTP trainees, full
financial support (tuition, stipend, and health insurance) for all years during their CD programming. The
training of CD students at Cornell is flexible. It typically starts with 1.5 years in the DVM curriculum,
then switching to a 3- or 4-year long Ph.D., and finally returning to the remaining 2.5 years of DVM
training. Of the current cohort of 15 CD students, including 2 newly admitted trainees, 6 (40%) hold
prestigious predoctoral fellowships, including 5 NIH F30s. Key objectives for our MSTP are to: (1)
Recruit and retain students, and grow a diverse CD student cohort; (2) Develop biomedical science
leaders with skills in major competency domains required for clinician-scientists, namely disciplinary
knowledge combined with clinical, technical, operational, professional, and self-development skills; (3)
Optimize DVM and PhD training integration and the combined time-to-degree through the temporal
intermingling of DVM and PhD training, research during the DVM curriculum, and clinical training during
the PhD curriculum; and (4) Expand opportunities for career development, both in academia and
beyond academia, and enhance skills in communication, team-science, and entrepreneurship. Our
overarching objective is to develop a diverse pool of well-trained veterinary clinician-scientists who
have the disciplinary knowledge and skills that will uniquely prepare them for leadership roles in
biomedical research to advance human health at the individual and population levels."
10894113,"Impaired healing of surgical incisions is the second leading cause of chronic wound care in the post-acute
setting, about $7 billion annually, according to Medicare. Optimal healing requires coordination and signaling
between sensory neurons and the immune system. These neural immune interactions are the focus of this
proposal. While the role of peptidergic sensory afferents, which release proinflammatory neuropeptides (i.e.,
calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) and Substance P (Sub P)) in response to injury, have been well
studied, the function of nonpeptidergic afferents, those afferents that are neuropeptide-poor, in wound repair
have not been well defined. My initial studies suggest nonpeptidergic afferents have a suppressive action on
immune signaling. One goal of my research program is to further define the role of these neurons specifically in
the inflammatory response evoked by surgical incision and during wound repair. My preliminary studies and
published transcriptomic studies have identified myeloid differentiation 1 (MD-1, encoded by gene Ly86), a
molecule of the innate immune system, to be expressed predominantly in nonpeptidergic neurons expressing
the Mas-related G protein D (MrgprD) receptor. Our preliminary data using MrgprDcre Ly86-/- knockout
(MCKO) mice, suggest that MD-1, produced by nonpeptidergic sensory neurons, functions as a regulator
of neural-immune communication and has anti-inflammatory effects. Nonpeptidergic afferents, via MD-1,
may also promote normal healing. We propose to determine the role of MD-1 in these neurons with regard to
the cutaneous inflammatory response, wound healing and resolution of incisional pain. We will determine if
loss of neuronal MD-1 alters immune cell recruitment and activation during inflammatory and proliferative
healing phases. We will examine tissue architecture as a metric of healing and changes in pain behaviors in
relation to the inflammatory state. The finding that MD-1 expressed by neurons regulates the immune
response to injury is novel and offers a potential new target for optimizing wound repair.
Regional anesthesia is used to manage perioperative pain associated with surgery and has also been
demonstrated to be protective of immune cells by decreasing sympathetic tone and its adverse immune
effects. However, the role of peripheral nerve blocks (PNBs) in neural immune communication at the surgical
site have not been delineated. Another goal of my research program is to characterize the role of PNBs
in the immune response to surgical incision. These studies will use the plantar incision model and sciatic
nerve blocks in mice to define the effects of PNBs on the immune response to injury and on healing. We will
define how type and concentration of local anesthetic and duration of nerve block affects the immune
response. Finally, using the MCKO mice, we will determine the effect of PNBs on the role of neuronal MD-1
signaling in surgical incision inflammation and healing."
10892195,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Skeletal deterioration and related fracture risk is exacerbated in the elderly cancer survivors receiving
radiation treatment (RTx), affecting independent living, and reducing quality of life. Cellular senescence, one of
the major pathways induced following RTx-induced DNA damage, is characterized by a pro-inflammatory
senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP, consisting of chemokines, cytokines, growth factors, matrix
degrading enzyme, etc), and is mainly regulated by cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKi’s) p16Ink4a and
p21Cip1. Till recently, it was understood that p16Ink4a and p21Cip1 co-expressed in all senescent cells and regulated
their function interchangeably. This theory however did not match with the expression pattern of p16Ink4a and
p21Cip1 post-RTx or in aging. Using gene expression and RNA in situ hybridization studies, we have recently
shown that cells express p21 or p16Ink4a in unique populations of bone marrow cells, osteoblasts, and osteocytes
independent of the expression of either senescence marker. Only a small proportion of cells express both p16Ink4a
and p21Cip1. Furthermore, we have compelling preliminary data using mass cytometry of bone cells, which
allowed us to visualize these independent unique populations of p16Ink4a and p21Cip1 expressing cells without any
coexpression of SASP, suggesting a physiological function of these CDKis. Interestingly, in a parallel analysis
in radiated bones, we identified elevated levels of Cd11b+p21+ myeloid cell population, which was accompanied
by expression of several SASP factors, thus allowing us to characterize these p21+ cells as p21+ senescent
(p21+SEN) cells. In a recent seminal finding, using transgenic mice harboring transgenes that enable the selective
elimination of either p16Ink4a or p21Cip1 expressing cells, the elimination of p21+SEN cells in the p21-ATTAC
[apoptosis through targeted activation of caspase] mice, but not the elimination of p16+SEN cells in the p16-INK-
ATTAC mice, could mitigate most of the RTx-related adverse events in bone in young mice. Whether this
approach of clearance of p21+SEN cells will work to alleviate RTx-related bone deterioration in old mice, which
have a pre-existing high burden of senescent cells, remains to be seen. Based on our compelling preliminary
data, we will test our central hypothesis that: “Acute generation of p21+SEN cells mediate RTx-related skeletal
deterioration and BMSC dysfunction, but targeted early clearance of p21+SEN cells can alleviate RTx-related
chronic skeletal deterioration and promote fracture healing”. To test our central hypothesis, our aims are: (aim
1)To identify key mechanisms that are involved in RTx-related skeletal deterioration following early clearance of
p21+SEN cells in young and aged mice, (aim 2): To assess bone architectural changes following cell specific
clearance (using our novel Cre-LoxP mice, p21-LOX-ATTAC) of p21+Cd11b+SEN myeloid cells and (aim3): To
assess if prior clearance of senescent cells pharmacologically or by genetic clearance of p21+SEN cells will
promote fracture healing. The project will address questions related to basic biology of aging and role of p21 in
skeletal cells and lay the groundwork to support the idea that an early intervention could prove effective to counter
adverse changes from RTx, and to alleviate chronic skeletal deterioration and reduce the risk of potential
fractures."

10911884,"Morphogenesis requires careful regulation across multiple dimensions to ensure proper positioning and identity
of differentiating progenitor cells. Ultimately, differentiating cells must coordinate multiple physical parameters -
their environment, position, proliferation and shape - and use these cues to inform their final state and function.
One such cellular shape change broadly utilized to produce complex tissue architectures is apical constriction:
the shrinkage of the apical domain of cells to become wedge-shaped. Apical constriction cumulatively drives
tissue shape changes during various key developmental processes, including gastrulation and branching
morphogenesis. The majority of what we have learned about the physical and regulatory features of apical
constriction come from non-mammalian model organisms, primarily invertebrates. Whether mammalian tissues
use conserved or distinct apical constriction mechanisms and machinery has not been elucidated, nor is it clear
how this conserved biophysical phenomenon can be so flexibly utilized across multiple disparate developmental
transitions. Although apical constriction machinery generally converges on the same conserved proteins, their
spatiotemporal dynamics vary widely across contexts and species. We aim to identify the proteins that direct
mammalian apical constriction, define their spatiotemporal dynamics, and connect the induction of this pathway
to core genetic drivers. We will uncover the general principles that ensure robustness and mechanical integrity
by examining diverse developmental contexts where apical constriction is a fundamental morphogenic feature.
Over the next five years, we will address how cell shape changes initiate and control morphogenesis by
answering the following questions: 1) What force-generating mechanisms drive mammalian apical constriction?
2) What molecular mechanisms regulate cortical reorganization during apical constriction? 3) How do
developmental cell fate transitions license physical aspects of cell shape? To ensure our findings can be broadly
generalized, we will investigate multiple systems where apical constriction is essential, including primary
intestinal cell culture and the early mouse embryo. Specifically, we model apical constriction in intestinal crypt
formation, primitive streak formation and neural tube formation. These systems will allow us to investigate the
dynamics of mammalian apical constriction, localization of key machinery components, protein-protein
interactions, and the transcriptional networks that control the timing of their induction. These studies will produce
deep insight into the mechanisms driving one of the most widely used morphogenetic cell shape changes, identify
novel factors that direct the process, and connect the regulation of cell state to essential physical features.
Together, this knowledge will establish a fundamental understanding of how mammalian tissues coordinate
morphogenesis. The proposed project aligns with my research group's long-term vision to define cellular
mechanisms controlling tissue patterns to understand how architecture regulates cell fates and behaviors."

We will continue to develop WormBase, a broadly and often daily-used knowledgebase of information about the
C. elegans genome, genes, sequence features, gene function, gene interactions, and related information. C.
elegans is a premier research organism with about 1500 registered laboratories worldwide who use the short
generation time, complete genome, efficient genome editing, defined anatomy and neuroanatomy to study a
wide range of biomedical and fundamental topics. WormBase also curates, stores, and displays information
about nine other nematode genomes of biomedical importance. We will continue to develop necessary
ontologies and gene nomenclature to support systematic annotation of the genome and gene function and
expression. After 20 years of independent infrastructure development, we will now use the Alliance of Genome
Resources infrastructure for data ingest, storage, efficient curation, and presentation via download, API, and
web portal. We will complete the migration of the software infrastructure by the second year. This project will
focus on curation of genome scale datasets and individual experiments from the literature as well as storage and
display of C. elegans- or nematode-specific data. A major challenge is the increased published data and datasets
and decreased staff, which we will proactively address by streamlining and making our systems more automated
and high throughput. Our main strategies for scaling curation are by increased automation, namely machine
learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI); and by community input powered by ML/AI, also incentivized by
microPublication-based reviews of pathways and genes. As we are trying to scale, while maintaining our very
high-quality data collection (which is re-used by many other bioinformatic resources), professional biocurators
with a deep understanding of the biology and researchers needs will increasingly focus on data modeling, quality
control, development and training of automated systems, and supporting community curation. We will curate
information directly tied to nucleic acid sequence including the genome sequence; sequence features such as
gene structure models, regulatory regions, variants, sequence-based reagents, genome-scale experiments; and
gene expression including reporter gene assays and RNA-seq, sc-RNA-seq. We will curate information centered
on gene function including phenotype of variants and perturbations, disease models, genetic and physical
interactions, Gene Ontology (GO) annotations, and pathways using GO-Causal Activity Models. After we
transition computational infrastructure to the Alliance, we will continue to curate datasets unique to C. elegans
and add them to the Alliance infrastructure. We will support researchers by a 24/7 help desk, which provides
advice and often analysis; curation, storage, and display of worm-specific datasets; provision of customized
analysis tools; and a community forum. For new data, we will specify software requirements for development at
the Alliance."

 PLP-dependent enzymes are one of the most versatile biocatalysts and catalyze a diverse range of
chemical transformations. They are widespread in nature and play critical roles in metabolism and numerous
cellular processes. Studying PLP enzymes is hence important for us to understand biology and develop
therapeutics. Because of their exquisite and versatile catalytic activity, PLP-dependent enzymes are also
remarkable biocatalysts to build diverse structurally complex and bioactive natural products; and are
indispensable biocatalytic tools for asymmetric synthesis of noncanonical amino acids and chiral amine
pharmaceuticals. However, despite the vast number of PLP-dependent enzymes characterized to date, our
abilities to predict, manipulate, and harness their activities are still largely limited. This research program desires
to fill the knowledge gap by integrating discovery, mechanistic investigation, and biocatalytic application to
systematically and comprehensively study four types of carbon-carbon (C-C) bond forming and cleaving PLP
enzymes, including our recently discovered PLP-dependent Mannich cyclase. These enzymes represent the
frontier of PLP enzymology because of their unusual activity, complementary synthetic utility to existing
biocatalysts, and unexpected evolutionary relationship with well-characterized PLP enzyme family. All proposed
aims are supported by strong preliminary data gathered in our laboratory. Our overarching goal is to understand
the chemical and substrate specificity and leverage this understanding to uncover previously unknown functions
of PLP-dependent enzymes and explore their non-native catalytic utility. Ultimately, the proposed research will
expand our mechanistic understanding on PLP enzymology, shed new light on metabolism, and provide novel
biocatalytic tools for amino acid biosynthesis."
10894057,"Project Summary: Patients inflicted with a traumatic injury, autoimmune disease, viral infection, or prolonged
exposure to toxins often experience acute brain damage, resulting in functional and anatomical changes within
the brain. Scientists have uncovered two key mechanisms through which innate immune cells drive acute brain
damage: infiltration of activated neutrophils and monocytes into the brain parenchyma from systemic circulation,
and chronic activation of brain-resident microglia. However, there is a basic science ‘gap’ in our understanding
of these overlapping inflammatory processes, which complicates the development of targeted therapeutics. To
what extent are the brain resident microglia, as opposed to infiltrating blood-derived myeloid cells,
responsible for acute brain injury in inflammatory disease? To address this overarching question, we
invented two enabling drug delivery technologies. The first technology is a biocompatible and biodegradable
nanogel, comprised of covalently crosslinked acrylic monomers, which delivers active protein specifically to
macrophages. We will leverage this material to answer our first key question: To what extent is peripheral
activation responsible for immune cell infiltration of the central nervous system (CNS) parenchyma? We
hypothesize that monocyte and neutrophil activation within circulation will induce central infiltration in healthy
mice, while exacerbating infiltration in inflammatory disease. We will optimize immunomodulatory variations of
the nanogel to activate circulating innate immune cells toward inflammation (interferon gamma) versus tolerance
(interleukin 10). We will evaluate the extent to which circulating innate immune cell activation using targeted
nanogels influences the cells’ biodistribution within healthy mice and mouse models of inflammatory disease.
The second technology is an injectable hydrogel encapsulating cytokines and donor macrophages that is suitable
for intracerebral implantation. Through direct injection of immunomodulatory proteins and myeloid cells into the
parenchyma of healthy mice, we will evaluate the impact of infiltrating myeloid cell phenotype on brain-resident
microglia separate from any activation within or infiltration from the periphery. We will quantify the extent to which
classically versus alternatively polarized macrophages, implanted within the brain parenchyma, activate brain-
resident microglia toward inflammation and induce neurological deficit (i.e. functional, anatomical). As proof-of-
concept, we will evaluate local delivery of anti-inflammatory cytokines and macrophages as a prophylactic
treatment for inflammatory brain damage associated with an LPS challenge. The MIRA award will allow the PI
(Clegg) to commit greater time and resources to these unanswered questions, interdisciplinary collaborations,
training, and mentoring of a diverse scientific workforce. We anticipate that long-term investment in this line of
inquiry will result in fundamental insights on the mechanism of inflammation-induced brain injury as well as
translational technologies for specific disease indications."
10907551,"PROJECT SUMMARY
During human development, cells interact with one another to drive collective and oriented cell behaviors that
control organ formation and tissue patterning. This coordination between neighboring cells is governed by planar
cell polarity (PCP), a signaling pathway conserved from flies to humans. An excellent example and functional
read-out of PCP, or collective polarization, is the ordered alignment of body hairs across the mammalian skin
along the anterior-posterior body axis. Genetic disruption of PCP components leads to severe developmental
disorders including cardiomyopathies, ciliopathies, and neural tube defects such as spina bifida. We lack a
detailed understanding for how targeting of the PCP pathway leads to developmental disorders. Importantly,
PCP disruption in mice that results in developmental defects and embryonic lethality also results in a failure to
properly pattern the embryonic epidermis, thus making the moue skin a suitable model system to study the
conserved biology of PCP. A hallmark feature of PCP is the asymmetric localization of core PCP proteins at cell
borders within a junctional complex organized via intercellular interactions of cadherin family member Celsr1.
Our long-term goal is to understand how Celsr1 adhesive interactions organize asymmetric cell junctions to
coordinate tissue polarity and how this molecular assembly is perturbed in human disease. The need to
understand how Celsr1 adhesion coordinates PCP asymmetry is underscored by the recent identification of
novel, predicted pathogenic, Celsr1 mutations in patients with neural tube and congenital heart defects.
Previously, our work revealed a role for cadherin-mediated dimerization, or lateral clustering, in the organization
of asymmetric PCP complexes. We hypothesize that Celsr1 cis-dimerization regulates trafficking of PCP
complexes during PCP establishment and that disease-associated Celsr1 mutations differentially impair Celsr1
adhesion and dimerization interactions to disrupt PCP during development. Using the mammalian skin as a
conduit for PCP function, along with molecular biology, protein biochemistry, advanced imaging and in vivo
genetic approaches, our research program will uncover the pathomechanisms of human disease-associated
Celsr1 mutations and reveal how Clesr1 dimerization regulates PCP establishment and maintenance. These
studies will provide novel insight into the mechanisms that regulate PCP and those that are perturbed in human
developmental disorders."

This Bridges to the Biosciences Research Training Program represents a new pathway to a baccalaureate
degree in the biomedical sciences for transfer students from Front Range Community College (FRCC
Westminster, FRCC Boulder County) to the University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder). The training
mission is to smooth the pathway for underrepresented minority (URM) students to earn their associate
degree from FRCC, transfer to an R1 University (CU Boulder) and complete a baccalaureate degree with a
research emphasis in a life science discipline that prepares them for biomedical research and professions.
The Colorado Front Range, including Denver and Boulder, has a burgeoning biomedical and biotechnology
economy with prolonged and steep growth in STEM employment. Yet fewer than 25% of Colorado students
earn credentials that meet employer objectives. Colorado is the seventh largest Hispanic/Latinx-populated
state in the United States, and the Front Range communities are diversifying rapidly. The need for a prepared
STEM workforce is pressing, and Colorado has an under-tapped population of high-achieving community
college students with diverse backgrounds and great potential to contribute to this workforce demand.
FRCC and CU Boulder are ideal partners due to geographic proximity; high rate of transfer to CU Boulder
STEM majors from across the state; significant percentages of URM, first-generation, and Pell eligible FRCC
students; and high success rate of FRCC students achieving their associate degree. However, there is a
relatively low rate of URM/underserved FRCC students who transfer to CU Boulder. Our institutions have built
strong partnerships for the benefit of student educational advancement and career progression. Systemic
benefits include 1) articulation agreements that provide a clear framework for successful transfer and timely
progression to biomedical science baccalaureate degrees, and 2) guaranteed admission to CU Boulder for all
first-time students who earn an associate degree through the Colorado Community College System (CCCS)
Bridge to Bachelor’s Degree Program. Our objectives are to 1) engage and recruit FRCC students; 2) build
student belonging; 3) build students’ skills, science identity, and self-efficacy; and 4) expand career paths with
greater workforce skills and/or preparation for professional schools. The “human bridges” of our B2B Program
include faculty mentors, advisors, and peer/near-peer role models. This supportive community will engage
early with FRCC students to ensure appropriate course progression and guide a rewarding research focus,
thus nurturing, inspiring, and cultivating confidence in the trainees as they progress toward their baccalaureate
degree. The research of CU Boulder’s best and most engaged life science faculty preceptors is intentionally
broad to resonate with the diverse scientific interests and goals of the B2B trainees. Our overarching goal is to
cultivate Colorado students from URM/underserved backgrounds in the biomedical sciences so that they will
become drivers of scientific inquiries that lead to discoveries important to all communities."

The tumor microenvironment (TME) in essentially all epithelial cancers is associated with significant biochemical
and structural changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Many tumors including those of the breast, pancreas
and ovary are characterized by profound changes in the collagen architecture. ECM changes (~micron scale)
are below the resolution of conventional imaging modalities but analysis of this structure is critical for
understanding carcinogenesis and metastasis. We have used the collagen-specific modality of Second Harmonic
Generation (SHG) optical microscopy to discriminate cancer specimens from normal tissues based on changes
in supramolecular structure, fibril structure, and fiber morphology, where we have focused on high grade serous
ovarian cancer (HGSOC). However, SHG cannot identify the specific molecular alterations, which could provide
critical information on disease etiology, prognosis, and response to therapy. Now we will develop a novel method
that combines spatially registered SHG and surface enhanced mid-infrared spectral imaging (SE-MIRSI)
correlating morphometric and chemometric information to elucidate tumor-promoting ECM alterations. The latter
spatially probes specific molecular signatures from vibrational spectroscopy and provides increased sensitivity
using nanophotonic substrates, allowing rapid and large-area chemical imaging of whole tissue sections.
Specifically, SE-MIRSI can quantitatively identify specific changes in isoform distribution, posttranslational
modifications and altered crosslinking of the collagen fibers. Spatial registration of SHG and SE-MIRSI then will
provide a comprehensive, ultrasensitive, label free, non-destructive, high-resolution structural and biochemical
imaging platform to investigate the role of ECM alterations in promoting tumor carcinogenesis and metastasis.
Here, we will develop a multivariate data processing workflow that identifies the specific signatures of collagen
and other ECM components from the two modalities establishing the basis of an accurate classifier. We will
validate the multimodal characterizations on HSGOC tissue samples. At the end of this project, we will have
developed a multimodal imaging platform that will uniquely identify collagen and other ECM biochemical
alterations in the TME. We will establish performance measures based on imaging speed and throughput,
sensitivity and classification accuracy. These structural and biochemical analyses will provide new insight into
carcinogenesis and disease progression in several carcinomas. We propose these Aims:
Aim 1. Identify specific structural and biochemical signatures of in vitro ECM models through the combined use
of SHG and SE-MIRSI.
Aim 2. Validate spatially registered SHG/SE-MIRSI method on high grade serous ovarian cancer and identify
specific associated structural morphology and biochemical signatures."

postgraduate trainees, junior faculty, community physicians, and other healthcare providers. CRTEC activities
are organized into three Specific Aims that provide career enhancement opportunities across the biomedical
training pipeline and develop the next generation of cancer researchers. Aim 1 will coordinate MECC and
institutional programming to educate and inspire high school students, undergraduates, predoctoral and
postdoctoral trainees and junior faculty to pursue careers in cancer research. Key activities include implementing
and expanding MECC high school and undergraduate pipeline programs, which focus on historically
underrepresented populations, expanding MECC’s extramurally funded training grant portfolio and ensuring that
the training pipeline is diverse and inclusive. Aim 2 will support career and professional development activities
across the educational continuum. Key activities include enhancing the mentorship program for junior faculty
through an iterative process of review and refinement, providing mentor (faculty) and mentee (postdoctoral
fellows and graduate students) training, offering career exploration workshops with a focus on alternative careers
in cancer research, and providing training and opportunities for trainees in the communication of cancer research
innovations to audiences in the Bronx catchment area. Aim 3 will track and assess the impact of MECC’s cancer
training and education activities. Key activities will include providing travel awards for trainees to present at
cancer meetings or workshops for skills development, incorporating trainees into the annual MECC retreat and
maintaining a trainee database to follow career progression and outcomes.

This is a new U01 application to establish a Clinical Center (CC) for a prospective multiethnic HFpEF cohort
from California central valley for deep phenotyping analyses. The investigative team is diverse,
multidisciplinary, and complementary with investigators from School of Medicine, College of Engineering and
College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences. The investigative team is highly collaborative and has
strong track records of previous participation in large-scale research networks involving electronic data from
heterogeneous sources, including EHRs, mobile health technologies, and direct-to-participant mailings/web
portals. UC Davis Heart Failure Network has one of the most diverse patient population in the country, with a
large representation of Latino population from California Central Valley. Our network has an extensive
catchman area with a momentous growth in patient volume. The proposed deep phenotyping will take
advantage of the newly developed total-body PET scan at UC Davis to decipher the roles of organ-specific
variations in metabolic syndrome and inflammation in a diverse and heterogenous HFpEF population. One
unique feature of the proposed study is the use of functional connectomics analyses to directly exploit the
heterogeneity in the HFpEF population. Indeed, it is the heterogeneity that provides the necessary data
needed to derive the interconnections to test the critical network drivers, that will provide eventual insights into
potential molecular targets for therapy as well as the unbiased classifications of subtypes of HFpEF. Finally,
functional connectomics analyses enable modular “plugin” of new datasets (e.g., microbiomes), derived from
deep phenotyping analyses from other CCs in the HeartShare Network. Therefore, our proposed study
promises to contribute both technically and conceptually to the overall understanding of the molecular
mechanisms underlying the heterogenous disease in HFpEF."

The purpose of this program is to educate upper-division biomedical engineering undergraduate students in the
area of biomedical device design and development. The development pathway typically includes discovery and
ideation, invention and prototyping, pre-clinical and clinical testing, regulatory decision making, and
commercialization. We expect the training will lead to well-rounded biomedical engineers, who can recognize
specific needs in a biomedical problem, and develop a proper procedure to design and achieve a solution. The
specific aims of this proposed work are to enhance problem recognition by clinical observations and effective
peer and multi-disciplinary communications; to improve students’ ability to propose and validate solutions for
identified problems; and to integrate multidisciplinary training in research, development, prototyping, pre-clinical
testing, regulatory decisions, and social responsibility into one complete program. To accomplish the aims, we
provide a linked training experience to enhance student engagement and maintain project continuity. The training
includes six phases over the span of a year: (1) clinical workshopping in which the students interview clinicians,
discover problems, ideate on solutions, and define their year-long projects; (2) a numerical simulation course in
which simulation is integral to the design process; (3) summer clinical immersion in which the students attend
clinical conferences, view surgeries, and receive more in depth training on clinical aspects of biomedical
engineering; (4) capstone design course in which students work in larger multidisciplinary teams on detailed
design, prototyping, and testing; (5) regulatory affairs course including an FDA workshop and mock FDA
submission; and (6) commercialization training. A diverse group of ten students per year participates in the full
program including clinical immersion, but these students will work in larger multidisciplinary teams during the
class projects and capstone design course, thus broadening impact of the program. Besides technical skills, we
also consider development of leadership, teamwork and self-direction skills. By the end of the training, we expect
participants will be able to apply knowledge learned to a device development process in a self-directed manner.
We also expect that the training program will provide a broader impact to the department and institution, and
hopefully to future biomedical engineering undergraduate education."
10834071,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Difficulty initiating or executing appropriate movement is characteristic of neurological disorders including
Parkinson’s disease and ataxia, while the production of abnormally repetitive movements is seen in
neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders such as Tourette Syndrome, OCD and ASD This research is
aimed at understanding the neuronal mechanisms by which C. elegans nematodes initiate, execute and
stabilize appropriate motor actions, in order to make predictions about how dysregulation of motor action
patterns arise. Currently, our understanding of the mechanisms that generate appropriate motor outputs in
physiological states and abnormal outputs in pathological states is incomplete. With 302 neurons with known
connectivity and numerous genetic tools to target and manipulate individual neurons, the nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans offers an excellent system to study the neuronal mechanisms of motor output
generation. C. elegans locomotion is composed of a stable of sequence of motor actions/states: from forward
locomotion to reversal with or without a turn, then a resumption of forward locomotion. Past studies have
associated the C. elegans interneurons AIB, RIM, and AVA with reversals, however the exact neuronal
contributions required to initialize, execute and stabilize motor states remain elusive. Based on their
connectivity and previous experimental results, I hypothesize that AIB, RIM and AVA primarily initialize,
stabilize and execute reversals, respectively, and that these functions will be reflected in their response to
optogenetic perturbation, their required temporal windows to drive motor state changes and their response to
combinatorial perturbation. In Aim 1, I will express the excitatory optogenetic channel, Chrimson, or inhibitory
optogenetic channel, GtACR2, individually in single neurons to understand the state-dependent timing of single
neuron activation or deactivation that drives motor state changes. In Aim 2, I will use the bidirectional
optogenetic tool BIPOLEs (a Chrimson and a GtACR2 channel in tandem) to determine the precise temporal
windows of activity required for reversal-associated interneurons to produce expected motor output. In Aim 3, I
will combine optogenetic perturbation with chemogenetic silencing in order to understand the interactions
between neurons required to generate stable, flexible motor states. Dissecting motor output changes in C.
elegans may elucidate broader themes in motor pattern generation and its dysregulation. This research will
take place in a highly supportive, inter-disciplinary laboratory environment. It requires the use of novel genetic
tools for neural circuit perturbation and computational behavioral analysis, ideal for my training as a future
physician-scientist studying the genetic and circuit mechanisms of behavior in health and disease."
10833675,"ABSTRACT.
An organism’s perception of its surrounding environment depends on the sensory function. Neurosensory cells
from the inner ear are involved in key biological processes associated with hearing and balance. To be able to
achieve their function these cells depend on a complex array of membrane receptors, ion channels, and
signaling molecules that are concentrated at extremely sophisticated structures positioned at the apical (hair
cell bundle and kinocilium) and basal (ribbon synapses) poles. Disruption of this network due, for example, to
mutations, results in morphological and functional abnormalities and forms the bases of many human genetic
disorders. This proposal is focused on studying the role of the Pcdh15-Itga8 (Protocadherin-15-Integrin alpha8)
complex during hair cell (HC) development and function, and the downstream signaling pathways activated by
it. Our recently published work and preliminary data suggest that the absence of Pcdh15-Itga8 complex results
in HC bundle abnormalities, increase the number of outer hair cells, and alterations in the Rhoa-ERM(Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin)-Yap signaling cascade. Moreover, Itga8 hair cell-specific conditional knockout mice have
progressive hearing loss and sensibility to noise exposure. Based on this information, our central hypothesis is
that during inner ear development, environmental cues activate the Itga8-Pcdh15 complex resulting in the
modulation of cytoskeletal elements that will activate downstream signaling cascades. Lack of the complex
results in inner ear abnormalities that over time can cause progressive hearing loss. We will test this hypothesis
with two specific aims. In the first aim, we will identify the environmental cues that lead to Pcdh15-Itga8
activation and the formation of cytoskeletal structures. We will also identify and characterize the complex’s
molecular targets. In the second aim, we will investigate the contribution of supporting cells and spiral ganglion
neurons to the Pcdh15-Itga8 complex phenotype and the sensibility to noise. Collectively the studies proposed
here will clarify the functional role(s) for the Pcdh15-Itga8 complex during organ of Corti development,
introducing a direct functional link between Usher syndrome and an integrin-downstream signaling cascade."
10897736,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of ubiquitous man-made chemicals utilized for their
surfactant properties in industrial and consumer products (cookware, clothing, carpets) as well as in firefighting
foams. PFAS are highly resistant to degradation, leading to their bioaccumulation in the environment and in
humans. Because of this, PFAS are currently circulating in humans at blood concentrations that are
magnitudes higher than other legacy contaminants. Exposure to PFAS have been associated with increased
risk factors for cardiometabolic disease (i.e., increased circulating cholesterol), or major clinical outcomes
related to atherosclerosis that include stroke and heart attack. However, no studies have yet reported on
whether exposure to PFAS can induce the development of atherosclerosis. The overarching objective of this
proposal is to determine if PFAS exposure induces atherosclerosis and to characterize the underlying
mechanisms leading to PFAS-induced development of atherosclerosis risk factors. We have shown in our
preliminary studies that Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor deficient mice (Ldlr -/-) fed an atherogenic diet and
exposed to a simple mixture of 5 environmentally relevant PFAS (PFOS, PFOA, PFNA, PFHxS, and GenX) for
7 weeks resulted in increased circulating cholesterol and bile acids as well as decreased bile acid excretion.
We also observed that PFAS exposure results in induction of ileal bile acid transporters, especially the ileal
reuptake apical sodium dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT). Therefore, the central hypothesis of this
proposal is that PFAS exposure induces atherosclerosis through mechanisms related to ASBT-mediated bile
acid transport and excretion. To test this hypothesis, I will utilize Ldlr -/- mice, which is the gold standard for
mechanistically investigating atherosclerosis because this genetically modified model has cholesterol profiles
that closely mirror those seen in humans and is a model sensitive to dietary manipulation. Experiments
proposed in Aim 1 will investigate the development of atherosclerosis in hyperlipidemic mice by monitoring
lesion development in the aorta and aortic roots, quantifying lipid, sterol, and bile acid levels, and
transcriptomic profiling. Aim 2 will investigate mechanisms underlying the PFAS-mediated increases in
circulating cholesterol and atherosclerosis. Experiments proposed in Aim 2 will explore how ASBT inhibition
modulates circulating cholesterol and bile acids, as well as the development of atherosclerosis. Collectively,
these data will describe new mechanisms linking exposure to PFAS and increased risk of atherosclerosis. This
proposed work will have broad implications for the use of well-tolerated pharmaceuticals as effective
interventions against PFAS-mediated toxicity."

Kombucha is a popular fermented tea that contains probiotics. This beverage has seen a surge in popularity in
the United States since the turn of the century and is purported to have many health benefits. Some of these
health claims have been cursorily examined, however, none have been rigorously tested and the mechanistic
interactions between the microbial components of Kombucha and the host remains unexplored. I will elucidate
the host metabolic response to consumption of Kombucha-associated microbes (K. microbes), thereby informing
its use in complementary health approaches. The impact of individual probiotic microbes on human health is
difficult to deconvolute as humans consume a complex diet, have trillions of gut microbes (including many
unidentified species), and measuring host-microbe interactions is not feasible in human subjects. Therefore,
animal model systems are essential to investigate the effects of consuming probiotics, including those in
Kombucha, on host physiological processes. Caenorhabditis elegans is an excellent model system to explore
how K. microbes modulate the host pathways that govern lipid homeostasis, because their microbiomes are
easily manipulated through the food source provided and they are a well-established system to study metabolism
and the aging process in vivo. I have established a standardized method to maintain C. elegans on a diet
exclusively consisting of K. microbes that is consistent with the community found in the fermenting culture
(confirmed through 16S rRNA sequencing). In preliminary investigations, I observed that populations of C.
elegans exclusively consuming K. microbes, as compared to a control diet (E. coli, the standard laboratory food
source), have altered expression of core lipid metabolism genes (e.g., beta-oxidation, fatty acid desaturation),
decreased fat levels, and an increased median lifespan. Critically, the molecular mechanisms by which K.
microbes alter host physiology is completely unknown. Therefore, I plan to use molecular and genetic
approaches in C. elegans to systematically identify the molecular mechanisms that govern the host response to
K. microbe consumption and elucidate the components of Kombucha that are necessary and sufficient to confer
the observed metabolic and lifespan phenotypes. The proposed experiments will provide unprecedented insight
into the mechanism by which K. microbe consumption reconfigures host metabolism."

The Coronavirus disease 2019 virus (COVID-19) pandemic has made a devastating impact on global public
health and economy over the past three years. Despite the success in rapid progress of COVID-19 vaccine
development, increasing rates of variants of concern (VOCs) with enhanced viral transmission and disease
severity, and/or ability to escape vaccine-induced immunity have challenged the global vaccine efficiency
efforts. Continuous work toward optimizing existing vaccine platforms and development of more effective novel
vaccines is needed. Intranasal immunization can lead to the induction of antigen-specific immunity in both the
mucosal and systemic immune compartments, and thus is effective in control of SARS-CoV-2 infection and
disease. However, most SARS-CoV-2 vaccines granted for emergency use authorization or in clinical trials are
limited to parenteral delivery as soluble antigens do not breach the nasal epithelial barrier but are transported
by microfold cells. We recently reported that a modified porous silicon microparticle (mPSM) adjuvant to
SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) vaccine triggered potent and durable systemic humoral and type
1 helper T cell- mediated immune responses following parenteral vaccination. mPSM also facilitated mucosal
uptake of SARS-CoV-2 RBD antigens. Two doses of parenteral and intranasal combined vaccinations with
mPSM-RBD elicited more potent lung resident T and B cells and mucosal IgA responses than parenteral
vaccinations alone, which led to markedly diminished viral loads and inflammation in the lung following SARS-
CoV-2 Delta variant challenge. Our results suggest that mPSM is an effective adjuvant for SARS-CoV-2
subunit vaccine in both systemic and mucosal vaccinations. We also found that combinatorial mRNA-
S+Nucleocapsid (N) vaccination provided stronger protection against Delta and Omicron variants infection than
the clinically approved S-expressing mRNA vaccine alone. Thus, to further optimize the immunogenicity of
mPSM-adjuvanted subunit vaccine, we will modify the formulation of antigens. Here, we hypothesize that
parenteral and intranasal vaccination with mPSM-based subunit vaccine triggers durable systemic and
mucosal immune responses which provide cross protection against SARS-CoV-2 VOCs infection and
transmission. We will initially optimize the immunogenicity and test the safety of m-PSM subunit vaccines in
mice (Aim 1). Next, we will study the protective efficacy of parenteral and intranasal vaccination with m-PSM
subunit vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 VOCs infection in young and aged mice and identify the immune
correlates of host protection (Aim 2). Lastly, we will confirm the immunogenicity of m-PSM subunit vaccine in
hamsters and evaluate its efficacy on prevention of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs transmission and enhanced control of
infection (Aim 3). The result of this project will be an effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate that induces
balanced systemic and mucosal immunity, provides long-lived cross-reactive host protection against SARS-
CoV-2 VOCs, and prepares us for future coronavirus outbreaks."

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can lead to cognitive disabilities and epilepsy, but circuit mechanisms remain
unknown. I hypothesize that the death of inhibitory interneurons and subsequent reorganization of neural
circuitry in hippocampus leads to post-traumatic deficits in spatial coding and memory. To test this, I propose
studies to systematically and comprehensively map the progressive structural and functional breakdown of
hippocampal neurons in a widely used mouse model of TBI. In Aim 1, I will use advanced whole-brain circuit
mapping technologies to visualize the inputs and outputs of hippocampal CA1 neurons in control and brain
injured animals. In Aims 2 and 3, I will use calcium imaging with miniature microscopes to determine how
spatial coding in hippocampus is altered by TBI and after interneuron transplantation. My long term goal is to
build an independent academic career dedicated to developing novel circuit-based therapeutics for brain and
spinal cord injury. Achieving this goal will require extensive training in the principles of neurotrauma, physiology
and behavior. UCI is an outstanding institution for training in these areas, primarily due to the rich community
of prominent neuroscientists and clinicians performing neurotrauma research and the pioneering role of UCI in
the neurobiology of learning and memory, epilepsy and behavior. To help me achieve my goals, I have
assembled a world-class team of internationally recognized scientists who will provide me with hands-on
technical training, formal coursework and career guidance during the award and beyond."

In this application entitled `Emory Training Program in Translational Research to End the HIV Epidemic',
we propose a new T32 training program focused on translational HIV science located at the epicenter of the
US HIV epidemic in the Southern US at Emory University in Atlanta, GA. Our training program will provide 2
years of support to 5 post-doctoral fellows and a summer internship opportunity for 2 pre-doctoral under-
represented minority (URM) students to conduct cutting-edge HIV research through hands-on experience and
formal didactics and also educate trainees on the broader context of HIV research across the translational
continuum. Our training program will be fully integrated with and capitalize on the significant HIV research
portfolio of the Emory Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) and span the spectrum of ongoing HIV research
activities in 3 major areas of focus: 1. Laboratory-based basic science, vaccine, and cure research, 2.
Patient-centered clinical research, and 3. Public health and implementation science. Our training
program will encompass research activities in each of the NIH HIV/AIDS research priorities to reduce the
incidence of HIV, develop next generation HIV therapeutics, conduct research towards an HIV cure, and
address HIV associated co-morbidities, co-infections and complications; but, more importantly, our program
will also expose trainees to cross-cutting areas of HIV research and team science to accelerate the translation
of discovery into improved health outcomes. We have assembled a team of 35 diverse and experienced
mentors across the 3 HIV research focus areas and designed didactic opportunities for our mentees to
complement their research projects and expand their understanding of bench to bedside to community
translation of HIV research innovation. In addition, the geographic position of our training program located in
and surrounded by 4 of the counties named as focus areas for the Department of Health and Human Services
Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) initiative further demonstrates the urgency to develop and support the next
generation of HIV investigators specifically at our institution. Given the gravity of the HIV epidemic in the South
and globally and the new DHHS initiative that proposes to end the US HIV epidemic in the next 10 years,
fostering the next generation of translational HIV scientists across the HIV research continuum is of utmost
importance. Post-doctoral trainees will emerge from our T32 program ready for scientific independence and
with a deep understanding of how their research fits into the multidirectional and multidisciplinary framework of
HIV research with the long-term goal of ending the HIV epidemic."

Background and Rationale: Asthma has high prevalence and morbidity among minority adolescents. Yet,
few interventions are tested in adolescents, with only one being web-based. Given asthma's significant impact
on this group, and the important role technology plays in their lives, this oversight is a significant public health
concern. There is a dearth of cost-effectiveness analyses and implementation studies in asthma intervention
research. This study addresses these treatment and methodological gaps. We developed and established the
preliminary impact of the Controlling Asthma Program for Adolescents (CAMP Air), a seven-module
personalized, e-health intervention for adolescents with uncontrolled asthma. Objective: We aim to: (1)
systematically evaluate CAMP Air's efficacy in 370 urban adolescents with uncontrolled asthma; (2) assess its
cost-effectiveness; and (3) identify multi-level factors associated with successful implementation of CAMP Air
to inform its future scale-up. Hypotheses: Relative to controls, over 1-year CAMP Air participants will have
significantly better asthma control as indicated by (a) higher scores on the Asthma Control Test (ACT) and (b)
fewer asthma-related urgent care visits (primary outcomes). CAMP Air participants will also have significantly
better (a) asthma self-care skills, (b) controller medication use, (c) lung function (measured by spirometry),
and (d) quality of life; and significantly lower rates of (e) steroid bursts, (f) symptoms days, (g) nights woken,
(h) activity limitations, and (i) school absences. We hypothesize that compared to the control, CAMP Air will
have favorable value (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio<$100,000/ quality adjusted life years [QALYs]).
Methods: We will enroll 370 9th – 11th graders with uncontrolled asthma from up to 19 NYC high schools. We
will randomize participants to CAMP Air or an asthma education control intervention and follow them for 12
months post-treatment. Using a decision-analytic Markov model, we will estimate CAMP Air's incremental cost
per QALY gained and cost per symptom free days, from both the societal and payer perspectives. For the
process evaluation, which is built on the RE-AIM and Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research
(CFIR) models, we will collect qualitative and quantitative data from students, caregivers, and school
administrators. Together with stakeholders we will develop strategies for widespread implementation of CAMP
Air, informed by our clinical efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and implementation results. Significance: The study
has high public health significance because it (1) targets an understudied population impacted greatly by
asthma, (2) leverages technology in a health disparate population to promote self-care, (3) assesses CAMP
Air's economic value using QALYs and symptom-free days, and (4) bridges a gap between research and
practice by identifying implementation factors to inform strategies for widespread implementation of CAMP Air."

 Single cell gene expression atlases are now routinely generated for human tissues and entire model
organism embryos and have shed light on the diversity of cell types and regulation of gene expression. While
these wild-type single cell atlases can predict candidate regulatory genes across development for focused
studies, further work is needed to determine the regulatory mechanisms and functional importance of the
observed expression patterns at scale. A key problem is how to identify homologous cells between datasets in
which their expression may be altered, for example data from the same tissue across evolution, or from animals
that have experienced a genetic or pharmacological perturbation. This project will use the widely used model
organism Caenorhabditis elegans to develop and test methods to compare cells across such conditions. Our
focus is on two biological problems. In Aim 1, we will compare expression in single cells between C. elegans and
four other related nematode embryos. These nematode species have nearly identical embryonic lineages to C.
elegans despite substantial sequence divergence (>1 substitution per neutral site), making them an ideal test
case for alignment of single cell datasets across evolution. We will generate large single cell RNA-sequencing
datasets for embryos of each species (C. remanei, C. brenneri, C. briggsae and C. nigoni). We will compare both
automated homology transfer and de novo lineage inference methods to identify cell types in each species. We
will use quantitative imaging approaches (smFISH and live imaging of GFP knock ins) to validate the results of
the single cell experiments. The resulting data will allow us to classify genes and cell types by the conservation
of their gene expression, providing insight into the evolution of cell types. In Aim 2, we will test the role of
conserved regulators in the specification and diversification of the mesodermal “MS” lineage (which produces
pharynx, body wall muscle, and some specialized mesodermal cell types). We will measure gene expression by
scRNA-seq after conditional loss of these mesodermal regulators using an auxin degron approach. As in Aim 1,
we will test and validate automated alignment methods for these datasets to identify cells. The resulting data will
allow us to distinguish homeotic fate transformations from the formation of novel cell states, to distinguish likely
direct or context specific targets from indirect targets of each regulator, and to generate a genome-wide
mesodermal regulatory network of a developing animal embryo."

The Developmental Research Program (DRP) of the UPMC Hillman Cancer Center (HCC) Ovarian Cancer
SPORE seeks to fund and facilitate translationally-driven, innovative pilot projects in ovarian cancer. The
overarching goal is to decrease ovarian cancer morbidity and mortality through stimulating new research in the
areas of prevention and early detection; mechanisms of tumorigenesis and therapeutic resistance; predictive
and prognostic biomarkers; and novel targets and approaches to therapy. An additional goal of the DRP is to
establish support for underrepresented minorities in ovarian cancer research. To accomplish these goals, DRP
will build on the successful program and infrastructure developed via a previous joint P50 award that resulted
in an approximate 35-fold return on investment. The DRP will widely solicit proposals annually using local and
national networks. To increase recruitment of underrepresented minorities to our DRP program, DRP will
leverage University of Pittsburgh and HCC programs with Minority Serving Institutions to increase the
participation of under-represented scientists. Additionally, members of the Internal and External Advisory
Boards will be encouraged to identify investigators who could contribute to the diversity of the DRP. The most
meritorious proposals will be selected based on an NIH-style two-tiered review to ensure rigor and absence of
bias. The DRP Co-Directors, SPORE Executive Committee, Patient Advocates, and SPORE investigators will
participate in the first-tier scientific review, together with ad hoc revewers when necessary. The final selection
of awardees will be made following a second-tier programmatic review involving the SPORE Internal Advisory
Board. Each award will provide $50,000 in funds, with half of the monies coming from the DRP and the other
half from HCC, demonstrating substantial institutional commitment. DRP will fund three pilots per year,
reserving one for an underrepresented minority investigator. DRP awardees new to ovarian cancer will be
assigned an experienced mentor to provide guidance and integration into the SPORE. Awardees will be
provided full access to the HCC Ovarian Cancer SPORE Core resources, including tissue specimens and
bioinformatic/biostatistical support, not only to ensure project success but also to support subsequent funding
applications outside the SPORE mechanism. All DRP awardees will meet bi-annually with the DRP Co-
Directors, prepare progress reports annually, and make research presentations at SPORE meetings. Those
that demonstrate significant research progress will be eligible for competitive renewal for a second year.
Exceptional pilots with potential for significant translational impact can be elevated to full SPORE projects. The
DRP provides a vital mechanism for achieving the SPORE’s goal of developing a diverse pool of ovarian
cancer researchers committed to overcoming this deadly disease."
10925304,"PROJECT SUMMARY – CAREER ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM (CEP)
The mission of the Hillman Cancer Center (HCC) Ovarian Cancer (OvCa) SPORE Career Enhancement
Program (CEP) is to foster the development of independent translational ovarian cancer researchers who will
impact ovarian cancer care. This includes supporting not only outstanding early career scientists, but also
experienced investigators wishing to transition their careers into translational ovarian cancer research, or
clinical investigators well versed in the design and performance of clinical trials who wish to broaden their
translational research experience. The HCC OvCa SPORE is fully committed to diversity and has established
collaborations with external institutions to increase the participation of under-represented scientists in the CEP.
The CEP will provide funding, access to SPORE resources, and a supportive research environment. Proposals
will be solicited annually and use an NIH-style peer-review scoring system to prioritize projects for funding.
Projects will be funded for 2 years at $50,000 per year, with half the monies coming from CEP and the other
half from institutional funds. The second year of funding will be contingent on progress made during the first
year. The CEP Co-Directors, SPORE Executive Committee, and SPORE investigators will participate in the
review process, together with Patient Advocates and ad hoc expert revewers when necessary. The final
selection of awardees will be made following a second tier review involving the SPORE Internal Advisory
Board (IAB). CEP awardees will be matched with an appropriate SPORE mentor and provided full access to
the HCC OvCa SPORE Core resources, including tissue specimens and bioinformatics/biostatistical support.
The CEP will directly facilitate career development through: i) constructive proposal review and feedback; ii)
research training with a mentor chosen from among diverse faculty with broad expertise and experience in
academic career development; and iii) access to development programs, including monthly ovarian cancer
research group meetings, monthly SPORE meetings, the annual HCC and Magee Womens Research Institute
retreats, and the annual SPORE retreat. The CEP will track progress of awardees and ensure that they obtain
any needed services from SPORE Cores, and make certain that they are fully integrated into the SPORE
program. Awardees will meet regularly with mentors and will be encouraged to participate in courses in clinical
and translational research to further enhance their career development. Projects that show the greatest
likelihood of impact and translation to the clinic can evolve into future full SPORE projects. Awardees will also
be advised as appropriate in the preparation of grant applications for funding outside the SPORE mechanism
and given access to SPORE resources to aid in this endeavor. These procedures were developed via a
previous joint P50 award that resulted in a 12-fold return on investment for CEP projects. Ultimately, the CEP
provides a vital mechanism for achieving the SPORE’s goal of developing the next generation of ovarian
cancer researchers committed to overcoming this deadly disease."
10931466,"Project 3: Abstract
In this project, we will examine the transcription factors and expression pathways that drive tumor development
in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). We have published already that transcription is a key dependence for
TSC tumors, and that MITF is a driver transcription factor for angiomyolipoma (AMLK) development. In addition,
we have recently generated a new model of TSC renal AML by inducing renal differentiation in TSC2-/- human
induced pleuripotent stem cells (hIPSCs) to generate renal organoids. A major cell subset of TSC2-/- renal
organoids have an AML expression phenotype in contrast to control renal-differentiated hIPSCs. In separate
studies, we have used single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) to characterize the composition of AML at
high resolution, and have confirmed the importance of MITF-driven transcription in AML cells. In the current
proposal, we will examine the JUN-AXL pathway in TSC tumor development, which leads to a novel kinase
inhibitor sensitivity. Using a Drosophila model, we will dissect in further detail how mTORC1 regulates Mitf
activity, and then translate key findings to mammalian cells. Last, we will use the TSC2-/- hiPSC renal
organoid model to identify the transcriptional circuitry required for AML development, using scRNA-Seq,
scATAC-Seq, and scChIP-Seq for H3K27ac and MITF. We will also determine the entire panel of transcription
factors required for AML cell development using Perturb-Seq applied to the TSC2-/- hiPSC renal organoid
model. Expected health-related outcomes include identification of multiple potential therapeutic approaches
for both TSC patients and cancers with TSC2/TSC1 mutations."
10814357,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We propose a series of five annual International Zebrafish Conferences rotating between locations in
the US/Canada, Europe and Asia-Pacific that discuss progress made using zebrafish as a model
organism to study vertebrate development, homeostasis, and disease. These conferences, to be held in
the summers of 2023 – 2027, will be the 18th- 22nd meetings in a successful series initiated in 1994 and
partially supported by this grant since 2000. The goal of the meetings is to facilitate communication of
cutting-edge research studies on an array of topics to a wide and inclusive cross-section of the zebrafish
research community of over 1,500 laboratories. To ensure that the zebrafish researchers, US-based and from
different countries, can participate each year, we organized the 2022 conference in a hybrid format, which
combined in-person and virtual participation. Such hybrid format reduces the economic, geographic and the
Covid-19 pandemic-imposed barriers to participation; it is environmentally sustainable and based on the success
in 2022, we plan to extend it to future conferences.
The International Zebrafish Conference provides an opportunity for zebrafish researchers to share their
most recent discoveries and new technologies. A diverse group of speakers is selected from the submitted
abstracts by the organizers and session chairs, based on impact, demographics and novelty with a strong
emphasis on unpublished data. Thus, the Conferences have historically had a major “slingshot” effect on
the field, launching new eras of research and discovery. Continuing in the tradition of previous conferences,
we expect that the proposed conferences will succeed in creating opportunities for sharing results and
technologies, forging collaborations, coordinating community resources, and fostering the exposure and
success of junior investigators and trainees. Importantly, the International and European Zebrafish Societies
embrace the notion that highly talented scientists of diverse backgrounds provide a richness and breadth of
varied approaches, expertise and perspectives that not only advance knowledge, but also greatly enrich the
scientific discourse at a conference. We, therefore, assembled a thoughtful diversity plan that outlines strategies
to increase the number of researchers from traditionally underrepresented groups.
The Conference has historically drawn zebrafish researchers of both genders in approximately equal
proportions, at a wide range of career levels with strong representation of students, post-docs, and both
junior and senior faculty. This grant will support 40 conference grants (registration/housing/travel of in-person
and registration of virtual) US-based participants and will support a virtual technology for these hybrid
conferences. These 40 US-based recipients of financial support will be chosen based on the impact and
originality of their abstracts, as well as on the basis of gender, race, career stage and need."
10908497,"Unhealthy alcohol use is common in people living with HIV (PLWH) and is associated with cardiovascular
disease (CVD) and mortality risk. Prior work suggests that heavy drinking alters gastrointestinal microbial
composition (i.e., gut dysbiosis) and gut dysbiosis may contribute to CVD risk. Gut dysbiosis impacts the
production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs e.g., butyrate), bile acids (e.g., deoxycholic acid), and choline
metabolites (e.g., trimethylamine N-oxide, TMAO). Whether these microbiome-dependent metabolites are
associated with incident CVD and death and contribute to the excess risk of CVD among PLWH who are heavy
drinkers is unknown. Each of these three metabolic pathways (SCFA, bile acids, and choline), if associated
with CVD in PLWH, could serve as a potential therapeutic target to reduce CVD risk among PLWH who are
heavy drinkers. The central hypotheses in the Microbiome, Metabolites, and Alcohol in HIV to reduce CVD
(META HIV CVD) program project grant are that among PLWH, a probiotic can mitigate alcohol-associated
dysbiosis and reduce microbial translocation, inflammation and harmful microbiome-dependent metabolites
(Project 1); and that altered SCFA, bile acid and TMAO metabolism are associated with increased risk of CVD
and death (Project 2). Our preliminary data support the scientific premise that unhealthy alcohol use, gut
dysbiosis and resulting metabolite alterations contribute to gut permeability, immune dysfunction, CVD, and
death. META HIV CVD Cohort (Project 2), is a prospective, observational cohort study led by Dr. So-Armah
(Lead), Dr. Freiberg, and Dr. Barve. The study will use existing data and biospecimens from the Veterans
Aging Cohort Study (VACS). New data to be obtained include targeted metabolomics and updated adjudication
of major adverse cardiac events (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, coronary revascularization, heart
failure, peripheral artery disease). We will assess 3 microbiome-dependent metabolic pathways and determine
the association of metabolites from these pathways with alcohol, CVD, and death by HIV status. Aim 1
assesses SCFA metabolic pathways focusing primarily on butyrate, a metabolite necessary for intestinal cell
health. Aim 2 assesses choline metabolic pathways focusing primarily on trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a
metabolite associated with increased CVD risk. Aim 3 assesses bile acid metabolic pathways focusing on the
deoxycholic acid to cholic acid ratio, which may be associated with dyslipidemia. For each aim, we will identify
metabolites independently associated with alcohol use, CVD, and/or death and determine whether these
associations are unique to or accentuated among PLWH vs. people without HIV. Aim 4 will replicate the
associations of heavy drinking and these metabolites with baseline data from the META HIV CVD clinical trial
participants (Project 1). IMPACT: This study advances understanding of how alcohol-associated gut dysbiosis
and dependent metabolites contribute to CVD and death. If our hypotheses are confirmed, these results could
lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets for reducing CVD among PLWH who are heavy drinkers."

10846824,"The overarching goal of the Stakeholder Engagement Core (SEC) is to ensure that technology solutions and
artificial intelligence approaches proposed and developed by the PennAITech Collaboratory are maximally
adoptable by and accessible to their end users by soliciting ongoing stakeholder input and involving all key
parties throughout all phases of the development and testing processes. Stakeholders include, but are not
limited to, older adults with and without Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, family and other informal
caregivers, physicians, nurses and other clinicians involved in the care of older adults, administrators, policy
makers and technology partners. The aims of this core are to 1) establish, maintain and grow a technology
consortium (consisting of technology companies, startups, venture capital firms, and angel investors) that will
provide guidance and collaboration opportunities for pilot projects and a platform for potential dissemination
and commercialization of innovative tools; 2) engage older adults with and without Alzheimer’s disease and

10718125,"Mood, anxiety, and traumatic stress disorders are common psychiatric conditions - affecting over 40 million U.S.
adults - and are leading causes of disability worldwide. People with these conditions are commonly plagued by
difficulty controlling distressing personal thoughts and memories, collectively referred to as repetitive negative
thinking symptoms. Models suggest that repetitive negative thinking is driven by executive functioning deficits,
such that cognitive resources are insufficient to downregulate unwanted thoughts. Executive functioning deficits
could be a promising treatment target but are not typically addressed with existing interventions. The long-term
goal advanced by this proposal is to develop effective, mechanistic cognitive training programs that can improve
cognition and reduce symptoms associated with mood, anxiety, and traumatic stress disorders. The objectives
of this proposal are first to determine the optimal dose of a cognitive training program designed to improve
executive functioning in this population using behavioral and neural outcomes (R61). If the cognitive training
tested in the R61 successfully improves executive functioning (go/no-go decision), we will evaluate the
relationship between change in executive functioning and change in clinical symptoms (R33). Our central
hypothesis is that repeated training exercises will enhance executive functioning and will lead to a reduction of
repetitive negative thinking in mood, anxiety, and traumatic stress disorders. The hypothesis will be tested by
pursing two specific aims: Aim 1 is to identify the cognitive effects and optimal dose of cognitive training. Aim 2
is to evaluate the clinical effects of the optimized cognitive training program relative to a sham condition. We will
also conduct an exploratory aim to determine generalization of cognitive training to real-world cognitive
performance. The R61 phase will test Aim 1 by randomizing participants with depression, anxiety, and/or
traumatic stress disorders to one of two doses of cognitive training or a no-treatment control condition. We will
examine executive functioning change with cognitive task performance and functional neuroimaging
assessments. The R33 phase will randomize participants to the dose decided by the R61 or a sham condition.
The R33 intends to replicate the impact on executive functioning and assess the relationship between change
in executive functioning and clinical symptoms. We will explore how cognitive training helps people in their daily
lives by including assessments given with a smartphone mobile cognitive testing app. The research proposed is
innovative because it aims to address symptoms by intervening on a cognitive target thought to generate
symptoms across multiple disorders, thus explicitly testing the interactions of cognitive and emotional symptoms.
Outcomes derived from the proposed research will include a novel treatment program and information about its
utility for reducing clinical symptoms. Knowledge from this proposal will advance our treatment options by
targeting a specific cognitive system, providing a foundation for neuroscience-based therapeutic alternative for
symptoms that span mood, anxiety, and traumatic stress disorders."
10839852,"The Animal Core for Addiction Related Behaviors of the NIDA P30 Center at Temple University will
support collaborative NIH-funded research projects using in vivo rodent models in order to advance
scientific knowledge on drugs of abuse, addiction, pain and the intersection of drugs of abuse with
HIV/AIDS. One aim of the Core is to provide the scientific expertise, personnel, equipment and other
resources that are necessary to assess drug reinforcement, reward, reinstatement, and related
endpoints of cognition and emotional function in rats and mice as needed to rigorously evaluate
potential new therapeutic compounds and targets, as well as to elucidate neurobiological mechanisms
underlying addiction. Another aim of the Core is to provide mutant rodent models to P30 collaborating
investigators in order to enable study of specific molecules and pathways in vivo. Breeding animals in a
central facility reduces the expense and promotes access of these valuable models to multiple
researchers. Core personnel will work with investigators to design experiments including an emphasis
on appropriate controls, data analysis, and result interpretation. If requested by collaborators, the
Animal Core will provide training in behavioral methods, or Core staff will perform the tests
independently. The Core offers the following approaches: intravenous and oral drug and ethanol self-
administration, operant responding for food or sucrose, conditioned place preference and aversion,
intracranial self-stimulation, learning and memory assessments, anxiety- and depression-like behavioral
tests, use of stress models and other methods as needed. New innovative behavioral assessments and
animal models are proposed in this renewal application in order to enhance the impact of the research
supported by the Animal Core for Addiction Related Behaviors. These include the application of
behavioral economic methods and intermittent access paradigms to drug self-administration studies,
measurements of ultrasonic vocalization to assess positive and negative affect during behavioral
testing, breeding of transgenic Cre rats, and support of humanized mouse models of HIV-1 infection.
The Core serves as a national resource by providing the knowledge, skills and equipment necessary to
enhance research programs and to promote extension of NIH-funded projects to include behavioral
endpoints and animal models relevant to substance abuse research."
10840009,"Project Summary
Health self-management—gathering, organizing, and acting on health information from a rapidly growing array
of online sources of healthcare information—is cognitively challenging for many older adults, especially those
with cognitive impairments. The goal for this project is to support the cognitive components of older adults’
health-management activities through development of digital assistant technology tools tailored to three
exemplar healthcare management task activities: accessing support services, managing healthcare finances,
and using the health-management tools provided by Medicare.gov. This project will leverage the machine-
intelligence expertise of our collaborators and our experience in developing and evaluating technologies for
supporting the health and wellbeing needs of older adults to harness technology to provide cognitive support to
aging adults, including those with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and lower SES. The project has three aims:
1) identify barriers and facilitators to diverse older adults use of current tools for managing healthcare in the
three targeted task activities and provide requirements for technology tools to support these activities; 2)
develop highly usable and reliable intelligent digital assistants capable of adapting to a large array of
healthcare tasks in each of the three exemplar areas; and 3) evaluate the efficacy of the assistants compared
to a usual tool including a digital assistant control (e.g., Google Assistant). The project will be comprised of
three phases. Phase 1 will use a multimethod approach across our three study sites to assess the demands
and challenges facing diverse older adults in the performance of the three health-management activities.
Techniques include structured one-on-one interviews of subject matter experts, cognitive task analysis of
existing tools, and process tracing of older adults’ task performance. In Phase 2, we will use the knowledge
derived from Phase 1, together with an understanding of older adults’ cognitive capabilities and limitations, and
their needs and preferences, to conduct iterative design of the digital assistant tools and evaluate their
effectiveness and perceived usability using older adults with and without cognitive impairments and diverse in
technology skills. In Phase 3, we will do a comparative assessment of the digital assistant tools for the three
health-management activities (4 problems in each domain) by randomizing a cross-site sample of 240
participants, with and without MCI, varying in age, ethnicity/race, SES, and technology experience, to novel
tool and control conditions, assessing efficacy and usability of the novel tools. The project will yield important
information on how best to design technology aids to provide cognitive support for health decision making."
