The long-term goal of the proposed research is to identify the mechanisms by which bidirectional
communication between the nervous system and the intestine regulates organism-wide responses to
oxidative stress through regulated neuropeptide release. Oxidative stress plays a critical role in cognitive
dysfunction and neuronal death associated with neurodegenerative diseases, but little is known about the
physiological roles that reactive oxygen species play as signaling molecules in the brain. My laboratory
uses the model C. elegans to study new signaling pathways that modulate neurotransmitter release. We
have identified a role for hydrogen peroxide as a signaling molecule that positively regulates the secretion
of specific neuropeptide-like proteins from dense core vesicles through sulfenylation of dense core vesicle
(DCV) release factors. We found that the regulated release of these neuropeptides activates the
antioxidant transcription factor SKN-1/Nrf2 in the intestine. Here we seek to uncover the molecular
mechanisms by which hydrogen peroxide regulates DCV release, and how, in turn, neuropeptide signaling
activates the antioxidant response. This study will reveal novel mechanisms underlying ROS regulation of
DCV secretion and it will provide fundamental insights into how redox homeostasis is achieved through
gut-brain signaling, and may therefore have direct relevance for the development of strategies to treat
neurodegenerative diseases whose progression is associated with unregulated ROS signaling."

Neurodevelopmental processes are shaped by dynamic interactions between genes and environments.
Maladaptive experiences early in life can alter developmental trajectories, leading to harmful and enduring
developmental sequelae. Pre- and postnatal hazards include maternal substance exposure, toxicant exposures
in pregnancy and early life, maternal health conditions, parental psychopathology, maltreatment, structural
racism, and excessive stress. To elucidate how various environmental hazards impact child development, it is
imperative that a normative template of developmental trajectories over the first 10 years of life be established
based on a sufficiently large and demographically diverse sample of the US population. To accomplish this, the
Healthy Brain and Child Development National Consortium (HBCD-NC) has been formed to deploy a
harmonized, optimized, and innovative set of neuroimaging (MRI, EEG) measures complemented by an
extensive battery of behavioral, physiological, and psychological tools, and biospecimens to understand
neurodevelopmental trajectories in a sample of 7,500 mothers and infants enrolled at 24 sites across the United
States (US). The HBCD-NC will carry out a common research protocol under direction of the HBCD-NC
Administrative Core (HCAC) and will assemble and distribute a comprehensive and well-curated research
dataset to the scientific community at large under the direction of the HBCD-NC Data Coordinating Center
(HDCC). The overarching goal of the HBCD-NC is to create a comprehensive, harmonized, and high-
dimensional dataset that will characterize typical neurodevelopmental trajectories in US children and that will
assess how biological and environmental exposures affect those trajectories. A special emphasis will be placed
on understanding the impact of pre- and postnatal exposure to opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco and/or other
substances. To address these broad objectives, the sample of women enrolled will include: 1) a racially,
ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse cohort that is representative of the US population; 2) pregnant women
with use of targeted substances (opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco); and 3) demographically and behaviorally
similar women without substance use in pregnancy to enable valid causal inferences. In addition, the HBCD-NC
will identify key developmental windows during which both harmful and protective environments have the most
influence on later neurodevelopmental outcomes. The large, multi-modal, longitudinal, and generalizable dataset
that will be produced for the first time by this study will provide novel insights into child development using state-
of-the-art methods. The HBCD-NC study will inform public policy to improve the health and development of
children across the nation."
10879142,"Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic, progressive, auto-inflammatory liver disorder that often becomes
refractory to immunosuppressants-the sole therapeutic option for AIH patients. Hepatic inflammation, which sets
the stage for overt AIH, is considered the main driver of hepatic tissue damage and fibrosis. While reversible, in
the absence of treatment AIH progresses to cirrhosis and end stage liver disease, requiring liver transplantation
in around 10% of cases. Its exact trigger and the underlying mechanisms by which AIH develops are poorly
understood, although genetic and environmental factors play an important role. The local liver microbiome has
been identified as one critical environmental factor that modulates hepatic pathology. The expansion of
commensal bacteria such as Lactobacilli spp. within the liver is associated with an increased severity of
experimental liver pathology, and Lactobacilli spp. are enriched in livers of AIH patients. Our lab recently
published that Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) translocates to internal tissues and thereby drives systemic
inflammation in mice that lack the epigenetic regulator Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (Tet2) in hematopoietic
cells (Tet2VAV mice). We recently found that such mice have AIH and are a model system to study this disease,
supported by epidemiological evidence that TET2 deficient individuals display cardinal features of liver disease.
The pathogenetic mechanisms underlying AIH, and in particular how the liver microbiome may drive it, are
unclear. Interferon- γ (IFN-γ) producing TCR CD8 T cells (Tc1 cells) have been identified to play an essential
role in AIH. Missing is an understanding of the key signals from the liver microbiota and how they are linked to
the induction of such pathogenic cells. Intriguingly, L. reuteri efficiently catabolizes dietary tryptophan (Trp) to
the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonist indole-3-carbinol (I3C). In a lupus model, AhR ligands derived from
E. gallinarum promoted Th17-driven autoimmunity. Here, based on our new data and this context from the
literature, we propose a model and testable hypothesis explaining how L. reuteri promotes AIH. We will test our
central hypothesis that L. reuteri promotes hepatic Tc1 cell immunity by releasing I3C and/or by fueling L. reuteri-
specific Tc1 cells in two independent models of AIH (Tet2VAV mice and Concanavalin A-mediated hepatitis).
Furthermore, we posit that therapeutic approaches that suppress AhR signaling protect from L. reuteri-triggered
Tc1 cell mediated AIH-like pathology. We will investigate this hypothesis in three specific aims. In Aim 1 we will
determine whether L. reuteri derived I3C acts directly on CD8 T cells via AhR, which promotes Tc1 cell effector
function that drives AIH-like pathology. In Aim 2 we will define whether L. reuteri-specific CD8 T cells drive AIH-
like disease. In Aim 3 we will define therapeutic approaches targeting AhR signaling within CD8 T cells (dietary
Trp, AhR blockade) in protecting from AIH-like pathology. These aims will lead to a better understanding of the
pathophysiology of AIH and assess rationale therapeutic interventions for patients with AIH."
10873985,"There are significant advantages from translating genome sequences into proteins, where there is a large body
of accumulated knowledge regarding their relationships among sequence, structure and function. Advances in
genome sequencing are producing a deluge of data that can be used to train and test prediction methods to
identify the characteristics of various mutants by building atop the large functional protein data. Clinicians
need to know the functional behavior of mutants - whether they are neutral or deleterious - whether they affect
protein structure – whether they affect protein dynamics - whether they affect protein binding specificity.
Protein structures have local environments for each amino acid in the sequence, and usually amino acids at
each position are compatible with their local environment. This leads to strongly correlated amino acids as
manifested in the multiple sequence alignments. This project will combine protein sequence and structure data
together with amino acid properties and their correlations to characterize each site in the protein structure to
investigate the hypothesis that outliers in the distributions over the important amino acid properties for each
position will negatively impact functionality, i.e. they will be deleterious mutants. The project will drill down
deeply to learn what is the nature of the impaired mechanism. Two diverse approaches will be taken in the two
aims: Aim 1 will investigate the amino acid property distributions to identify the properties that best characterize
each position in the sequence and structure, and determine how the outliers negatively impact the functional
structures, dynamics and binding characteristics. Preliminary results show that the deleterious mutants usually
have a significantly broader range of single amino acid properties for the deleterious mutants. Data from these
analyses will be fed into Aim 2 where two type of machine learning approaches – Extreme Learning Machines
and Random Forests will be jointly applied. Preliminary results show that incorporating just one amino acid
property yields significant gains over existing methods. One of the major strengths of this project is that results
from the two Aims will be exchanged frequently to achieve improved predictions for both approaches. The
project builds on the long experience of the PIs in datamining from protein structures and sequences, as well
as previous machine learning applications. Important potential outcomes include a more reliable, more
informed understanding of how mutants affect function. In addition, the project aims to predict connections of
mutants to specific diseases. The results of the project will be important for drug development, because the
specific part of the protein where function is impaired will be identified, to allow drug developers to narrow their
focus onto more limited parts of a protein that is targeted for drug design. The predictors established by this
project will also have the potential to screen for large numbers of previously unknown mutations that could be
used to identify specific regions of a protein structure susceptible to further disease-related mutations."

Accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn) into Lewy Bodies and Lewy Neurites is a hallmark of the Lewy Body
Dementias (LBD), Dementia with Lewy Bodies and Parkinson’s Disease-Dementia. Additionally, some brain
regions in Alzheimer’s Disease have pathological α-syn. Therefore, α-syn is likely a major cause of cognitive
decline across several dementias. One possible mechanism underlying the core cognitive impairments centered
around impaired executive function in LBD may be loss or dysfunction of projection neurons from the basal
forebrain that produce acetylcholine (ACh). Across LBD, there is profound loss of cholinergic cells of the basal
forebrain, which project to the prelimbic medial prefrontal cortex (PL-mPFC), a known key brain nucleus for
executive function. Basal forebrain ACh acts through nicotinic and muscarinic ACh receptors (mAChR) to
modulate PL-mPFC glutamatergic projection neurons critical for normal executive function. Recent evidence has
further refined the mechanisms by which ACh regulates the PL-mPFC, and has suggested a key role for the M1
mAChR in regulating executive function. Despite this critical neuromodulatory role of ACh and M1 in the PL-mPFC
in executive function, there are few studies that examine this important relationship in the context of α-syn related
dementias. This has led to our overall hypothesis that cognitive decline in the context of α-syn linked
dementias results from disrupted ACh signaling in the mPFC. We have used the pre-formed fibril (PFF)
model of α-synucleinopathies to show that inputs into the PL-mPFC show enhanced ACh dependent long term
depression in PFF injected mice. Additionally, layer 5 pyramidal cells of the PL-mPFC show decreased excitability
in PFF injected mice compared to controls that may be attributable to ACh dependent changes in intrinsic
properties of these cells. This suggests that α-syn dysregulates multiples aspects of the PL-mPFC through
alterations in ACh release or signaling. To rigorously test this, we will perform a series of electrophysiology and
behavioral experiments to determine, define, and dissect how α-ayn dysregulates the PL-mPFC through loss of
ACh signaling or release. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that α-syn dysregulates PL-mPFC inputs through
altering ACh signaling. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that α-syn alters intrinsic properties and output of PL-
mPFC projection neurons through loss of ACh signaling. In aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that boosting
cholinergic signaling will rescue deficits in executive function. Completion of these aims will provide fundamental
understanding of how α-syn dysregulates ACh signaling to impair executive function in LBD."
10888200,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is one of the leading causes of chronic pain and disability worldwide, affecting over
30% of older adults, and represents a major global health and economic burden to individuals and society. The
rates of KOA have more than doubled in the past 70 years and continue to grow sharply, given increases in life
expectancy and population BMI. Surgery is often used to treat KOA, but is associated with a high rate of
persistent pain and is not a permanent solution. Numerous nonsurgical therapies have been advocated to treat
pain in patients with KOA. A growing literature documents enhanced central nervous system pain processing,
known as central sensitization (CS), which produces widespread sensitivity, among KOA patients. Sleep
disturbance is associated with CS but imparts a terrible burden on patients suffering from pain in its own right.
Both CS and sleep disturbance are hallmarks of various chronic pain conditions and important treatment
considerations, with both independently being associated with the initiation and maintenance of pain and
heightening pain severity
. The parent project, which provides the platform for the current proposal, will evaluate
behavioral, pharmacologic, and procedural interventions for KOA; a step-care model that allows for multiple
treatment comparisons and phenotyping to improve selection for each therapy, which is expected to refine
outcomes and reduce unnecessary interventions. The results of this study, which will follow pragmatic
principles in order to maximize the information provided to stakeholders, will address not only the effectiveness
of each tested intervention but also provide meaningful information regarding effectiveness across key
subgroups of patients. However, the parent project will not assess CS or sleep disturbance, due to the
additional expertise, expense, equipment and time required. A mechanistic evaluation of these factors is
required to substantiate their impact on treatment response. The current proposal seeks to substantiate
whether the conceptual understanding of these factors is legitimate. The project will also evaluate whether
advanced understanding of CS and sleep disturbance are important contributions on top of the more easily
quantified phenotypes collected in the parent project. The knowledge gained will inform patient phenotyping to
better match patients with effective interventions, ultimately reducing the substantial heterogeneity across
intervention outcomes and reliance on opioid therapies."

The COVID-19 pandemic and related public health policies (e.g., physical distancing, school closures, vaccine
distribution) are likely impacting the short- and long-term sexual health behaviors of adolescents in the United
States (US). Although essential to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 on population health, these necessary
public health measures may be substantially disrupting the provision of and access to sexual health services
(i.e., contraception, HIV/STI testing, pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP]). Further, emerging evidence
underscores the drastic impact of physical distancing measures on sexual behaviors, as well as mental health
and substance use. The nascent research in this area has been among adults. It is likely that these effects
may be even more pronounced among adolescents given their developmental stage.
Youth 13–17 years of age in the US are substantially burdened by sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and
unintended pregnancies. Preliminary data suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic and related policies may be
having both deleterious effects, including decreased access to STI testing, while also having potentially
positive impacts, such as reduced opportunities for condomless sex acts on adolescent sexual health. The
effects of COVID-19 and related policies on adolescent sexual health behaviors have yet to be systematically
investigated, however. Further, COVID-19 may be amplifying existing sexual health disparities experienced by
sexual and gender minority (SGM) and racial/ethnic minority youth. Given that COVID-19 is disproportionately
impacting marginalized communities, it is particularly critical to understand how the pandemic is influencing the
sexual health of youth facing health disparities.
To investigate how the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health policies are impacting the sexual health
behaviors of adolescents both in the short- and long-term, we propose to recruit via social media and survey
online a longitudinal cohort of 2000 13–17-year-olds from across the US. SGM and racial/ethnic minority youth
will be over-recruited. We will survey youth 12 times over the course of 3.5 years to: (1) Identify the immediate
impact of COVID-19 on their sexual health behaviors (HIV/STI acquisition; unintended pregnancy; number of
penile-vaginal and penile-anal sex acts, respectively; number of condom- and contraceptive-protected sex
acts; HIV/STI testing; and PrEP uptake); (2) Identify longitudinal trends in sexual health behaviors as the
COVID-19 pandemic and related public health policies change; and (3) Examine how trends vary by important
subgroups of youth (i.e., by sex assigned at birth, gender, sexual identity, and racial/ethnic identity).
The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed the lives of adolescents across the US in a very short
amount of time. Understanding how this change relates to their sexual health behaviors will be critical to
continuing to reduce health disparities among adolescents."
10911026,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive, fatal, and untreatable neurological disease characterized
by muscle weakness, atrophy and spasticity, typically leading to paralysis and death within 3-5 years after
symptom onset. Pathologically, ALS is primarily characterized by the degeneration and death of motor neurons
(MN) in the cerebral cortex and spinal cord. Damage to MN is associated with the onset of ALS however the
progressive loss of motor neurons is a non-cell autonomous process that requires damage of neighboring non-
neuronal cells. Indeed, the presence of reactive astrocytes and microglia in heavily-affected areas is a hallmark
of ALS. Deregulation of lipid metabolism and malfunction of the immune system have been implicated in the
pathogenesis of ALS. Sphingolipid metabolism was identified as the most dysregulated pathway, and ceramide
species, which promote apoptosis and inflammation, were found to accumulate in postmortem spinal cord
samples of ALS patients. Influx of T lymphocytes into the central nervous system occur early in the disease.
While some lymphocytes activate neuroinflammation others, regulatory T cells (Tregs), hold neuroinflammation
in check. Protective and harmful phenotypes of microglia and astrocytes appear to coexist in affected tissue.
The fact that immunosuppressant treatments have been disappointing in ALS may be because of the dual nature
of the immune system. Fingolimod is a structural analog of sphingosine that has been approved for the oral
treatment of multiple sclerosis. Unlike conventional immunosuppressive drugs, fingolimod does not inhibit
lymphocyte activation but reduces the migration of pathogenic lymphocytes into the central nervous system
(CNS) and increases the number of circulating Tregs. Fingolimod readily crosses the blood brain barrier and in
the CNS, promotes the neuroprotective phenotype in glial cells. In a recent preclinical study, fingolimod improved
the survival rate of SOD1-G93A mice, a mouse model of ALS, and the beneficial effect was associated with
modulation of microglial activation and innate immunity. We propose a study to test the hypothesize that altered
the S1P signaling drives the proinflammatory activation of astrocytes and microglia in ALS and that treatment
with S1P modulators will interfere with the proinflammatory process to slow down (or recover) the degeneration
of MN with the ultimate goal of paving the way to find new therapies to treat or cure the disease. In Aim 1 we will
use two different mouse models of ALS (SOD1-G93A and TDP43-Q331K) and human postmortem lumbar cord
samples from ALS patients to investigate the S1P system in the etiology ALS to establish the rational for using
modulators of the S1P signaling system for the treatment of ALS. In Aim 2 we will perform a dose-response
study (1, 0.3, 0.1, and 0.03 mg/kg/day) starting at a pre- or post-onset stage using fingolimod that acts on
S1P1,3,4,5 and AUY954, a second generation S1P modulators with specificity to S1P1. In Aim 3 we will
determine anatomical differences in the spinal cord of treated and untreated ALS mice using ex-vivo magnetic
resonance (MR) imaging, a technique with high potential to translate to humans. The study incorporates
principles of rational pharmacology and clinical evaluation combined with state-of-the-art neuropathological,
neurochemical, and MR spectroscopy and imaging techniques to define the therapeutic benefits of S1P
modulators and will provide valuable data towards understanding the pathological process of ALS and finding
new approaches to treat, diagnose, and monitor the disease."
10911025,"Excess aldosterone and cortisol production from the human adrenal cortex commonly contributes to
hypertension, heart failure, obesity, glucose intolerance, and low bone mass. Cytochromes P450 11B2 and
P450 11B1 catalyze the final steps in the biosynthesis of aldosterone and cortisol, respectively. The zone-
specific regulation of these enzymes maintains salt and water balance or carbohydrate metabolism and
response to physiologic stress. The enzymes share 95% sequence similarity, and both catalyze the 11β-
hydroxylation of 11-deoxycorticosterone and 11-deoxycortisol. In contrast, the 18-hydroxylase of P450 11B1 is
poor compared to P450 11B2, and only P450 11B2 has 18-oxidase activity, which converts 18-hydroxy-
corticosterone to aldosterone. P450 11B2 has high processivity, in that the intermediates predominantly do not
dissociate before additional turnovers to aldosterone, but the reasons for this processivity and whether this
property is required for aldosterone production are not known. A comparison of its microscopic steps with
those of P450 11B1 offers an opportunity to understand the unique biochemistry of aldosterone production.
 Our long-term goal is to elucidate the biochemical and physical properties that confers high 18-
hydroxylase and moderate 18-oxidase activities to P450 11B2 but not P450 11B1. Our central hypotheses
are that: (1) the positioning of nascent corticosterone generated from 11-deoxycorticosterone in the active site
and the conformation of P450 11B2 is different that the nature of the complex when corticosterone binds as
initial substrate; and (2) that the processivity of P450 11B2 reflects a combination of slow dissociation rates
and high coupling efficiency with the intermediates. Consequently, the objectives of this application are to
characterize the binding constants, binding and dissociation rates, pre-steady state (single turnover) kinetics,
and coupling efficiencies for P450 11B1 and P450 11B2 with several substrates and to deduce which
parameters correlate best with processivity. As tools for these studies, we will employ mutations that alter the
activities for P450 11B1 and P450 11B2 and alternate substrates that have specific chemical properties.
 In Aim 1, we will dissect the 18-hydroxylase activity of P450 11B1 and P450 11B2, wild-type and
mutations. In Aim 2, we will focus on the 18-oxidase activity with a parallel series of studies as in Aim 2. In Aim
3, we will focus on extrinsic factors, specifically the lipid composition of the membrane environment, in
regulating the processivity and latter two activities of P450 11B2. We will use nanodiscs to generate artificial
enzyme-membrane systems and confirm key results in transfected HEK-293 or V79 cells. The work will utilize
the specialized instrumentation that the Auchus and Waskell laboratories have employed to study cytochrome
P450 enzymes for many years and state-of-the art tandem mass spectrometry at the University of Michigan. In
this manner, we will systematically define the differences in the reaction mechanisms and properties for P450
11B1 and P450 11B2. These studies will inform strategies to screen for better drugs to safely inhibit key steps
of aldosterone and cortisol production for the treatment of human diseases."
10664899,"Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) studies report that
combat veterans are at increased risk for binge drinking and the development of alcohol use disorder (AUD).
38% of Army active duty members surveyed returning from OEF/OIF deployments between 2008 and 2011
reported binge drinking. Furthermore, veterans between the ages of 20 and 25 are 2.21 times more likely to
binge drink and 2.24 times more likely to have an AUD than their peers aged 46 years or older, outlining the
prevalence of alcohol abuse in the young veteran population. Importantly, more than 50% of males surveyed
reported hazardous binge drinking even prior to deployment. Despite repeated binge drinking being associated
with acute and long-term cognitive impairment and increased likelihood of developing AUD, the underlying
mechanisms are not well understood.
 Studies using a rat model of binge drinking called chronic intermittent ethanol exposure (CIE) demonstrate
long-term deficits in hippocampal neuronal structure, function, and behavior. We have shown that, coincident
with changes in CA1 hippocampal neuronal circuit function, binge ethanol (EtOH) exposure results in chronic
dysregulation of astrocyte-secreted signaling factors known to be involved in synaptic remodeling. Astrocytes
tightly regulate synaptic activity and ion homeostasis through their perisynaptic astrocyte processes (PAPs),
allowing for bi-directional communication through various contact-mediated and secreted signaling factors that
modulate synaptic transmission. In addition, the behavioral relevance of astrocyte/synaptic communication is
beginning to emerge through exciting new advances showing astrocytes to be involved in behavioral resiliency,
fear learning, and contributing to working memory deficits following drug exposure.
 Our current data demonstrate that EtOH-induced persistence of immature dendritic spines (i.e. sites of
excitatory synaptic input) is spatiotemporally linked with PAP-synaptic decoupling. We predict that disruption of
PAP proximity to synapses compromises the ability of astrocytes to regulate synaptic homeostasis. Therefore,
the overall objective of this application is to elucidate how EtOH-induced disruption of astrocyte function and
PAP-synaptic coupling contributes to long-term changes in synaptic networks. Achieving this objective will
allow us to reach our long-term goal, which is to identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms that may
inform novel treatments for the prevention and reversal of synaptic dysfunction and the emergence of AUD
after repeated binge EtOH exposure. Our central hypothesis is that repeated binge EtOH exposure triggers
aberrant astrocyte signaling and disruption of PAP-synaptic proximity that drive lasting deficits in synaptic
structure and homeostasis. The rationale behind this project is that understanding how disruption of astrocyte
function and PAP-synaptic communication occur will contribute key insight into the mechanisms underlying
synaptic dysfunction following binge EtOH exposure. The proposed research is significant since successful
completion will result in the identification of non-neuronal processes critical for the prevention and reversal of
neuronal circuit remodeling following binge ethanol exposure. An interdisciplinary team of investigators with

10880623,"Project Summary/Abstract
Neurocristopathies are a class of syndromes that are predominately characterized by malformations in the
craniofacial complex. These defects are caused by aberrant development of the neural crest, a stem cell
population unique to vertebrates. One distinctive feature of the neural crest is their ability to give rise to both
ectomesenchymal (bone/cartilage) and non-ectomesenchymal (melanocytes and peripheral neurons/glia)
derivatives. SoxE transcription factors play important roles in both the formation and the diversification of the
neural crest. All three SoxE factors (Sox8, Sox9, and Sox10) function redundantly to promote neural crest
formation. Interestingly, individual SoxE factors direct the differentiation of the neural crest into distinct lineages.
Sox9 promotes chondrogenesis while Sox10 supports both the melanocyte and peripheral neuron/glial fates. An
outstanding question is how these highly similar SoxE factors lead to neural crest specialization. This proposal
utilizes omics-based approaches, gain and loss of function experiments, and Sox9-Sox10 chimera constructs to
assess how and when SoxE-mediated neural crest specialization occurs. Furthermore, mutations in SOX9 and
SOX10 are causative for Campomelic dysplasia and Waardenburg syndrome, respectively. The syndromes
present with very different craniofacial phenotypes which are reflective of SOX9/SOX10 specific defects during
neural crest specialization. Work from this study will lead to the identification of novel SoxE transcriptional targets,
determine when SoxE factors begin to promote neural crest specialization, and determine how specific patient
variants for Campomelic dysplasia/Waardenburg syndrome cause disease phenotypes. Overall, this work is of
high clinical significance and will provide evolutionary insights into the molecular origins of neural crest
diversification. My primary goal for the mentored phase of this proposal is to identify when SoxE factors begin to
promote lineage specialization within the neural crest and determine the functional domains that contribute to
SoxE family subfunctionalization. I plan to use my remaining time as a postdoctoral fellow to master new
experimental techniques and develop robust computational analyses. I will capitalize on the rich academic
environment of Northwestern University, especially the expertise in NSF-Simons Center for Quantitative Biology.
My long-term career goal is to establish an independent research program that uses multiple model systems to
investigate the cellular and molecular origins of syndromes characterized by craniofacial phenotypes. I plan to
use Sox transcription factors (and associated syndromes) as a starting point in my career, but then extend my
research interests to other gene families through collaboration with clinicians. My measurable experience with
various model organisms will allow me to investigate biochemical, molecular, cellular, and morphological aspects
of developmental disorders by exploiting the benefits of each model system."
10825576,"Abstract
 Numerous recent studies have consistently shown that likely no two cells in the human body have the
same genomes, a phenomenon called somatic mosaicism. Mosaicism can be studied using various approaches,
but the study of mutations directly in the cell promises a comprehensive characterization of mosaicism in any
tissue. Analysis of single cell genome by cloning relies on natural DNA replication machinery in cells and, thus,
minimizes errors in DNA during cloning; however, cloning is limited by the ability of cells to proliferate. Analysis
by whole genome amplification (WGA) is hampered by introduced errors and non-uniformity of amplification.
Here we propose to address the limitations of single cell cloning and single cell WGA by developing a hybrid
approach that proceeds in two stages: 1) limited culturing of single cells to a micro-sized colony of 2-50 cells;
and 2) WGA of the micro-size colonies to yield enough DNA material for sequencing. An optimized hybrid
approach will enable rigorously and unbiasedly studying somatic mosaic at a single cell level throughout the
human body without WGA artifacts. Finally, to preserve tissue cell heterogeneity and enable biobanking of
tissues amenable to the developed hybrid approach, we will develop a storing protocol for tissues to preserve
proliferative potential of cells in the stored tissues. Success of the project would enable comprehensive and
accurate discovery of mutations in a single cell in a variety of tissues prioritized by SMaHT and beyond,
deepening our understanding of the mosaicism of humans.

Parental care is essential for offspring well-being and survival yet requires a significant invest from adults

different sex, physiological state, and genetic background. Previous studies examining sex- and state-
dependent influences on parental behavior have lacked the cell-type resolution critical to understanding how
specific circuit components are modulated. The long timescale (hours to days) of changes affecting parenting
behaviors suggests that neural circuits respond through dynamic gene expression changes. Through the use
of intersectional genetics and single cell analysis I have established exquisitely specific access to two key
neuronal hubs controlling parenting behavior. Preliminary results comparing Mothers, Fathers, and Virgin
animals suggest potential transcriptional, epigenetic, and biophysical differences that are dependent on the
animal’s sex and physiological state. During the K99 phase of the work proposed here I will rigorously assess
sex- and state-dependent transcriptional changes, as well as their biophysical and behavioral implications,
using the latest tools for cell-type specific recording and manipulation. I will uncover gene regulatory networks
that give rise to observed transcriptional changes and will develop new intersectional tools to modulate gene
expression in a cell-type specific manner. The successful completion of these Aims will reveal the molecular
mechanisms though which sex and state mediate transcriptional reprograming to affect the function of this
conserved behavioral circuit. Genetic variation also contributes to differences in the display of parental care.
Preliminary results utilizing genetically distinct mouse strains show dramatic differences in parenting behavior
and suggest a genetic contribution to behavioral variation. In the independent R00 phase of this proposal, I will
perform a forward-genetic screen utilizing a well-characterized panel of genetically diverse mice to find
genomic variants that contribute to parental behavior. The cell-type specific gene regulatory networks revealed
in the previous Aims will then be used to assess the causal role of individual variants, providing a level of
molecular explanation unobtainable with previous genetic mapping experiments. Furthermore, the successful
completion of this project will provide a platform for future experiments aimed at understanding how genetic
variants contribute to gene expression that ultimately affects animal behavior.
The training phase of the award will be conducted in the laboratory of Dr. Catherine Dulac at Harvard
University. In addition, I will be mentored by the outstanding team of scientists on my advisory committee that
will assist with specific training goals as well as career guidance. In my application I have outlined a
comprehensive plan for the acquisition of conceptual, technical, and professional skills that will enable my
transition to an independent research position."

 Craniofacial birth defects, e.g., cleft lip and cleft palate, are among the most common congenital
malformations in humans. Similarly, acquired diseases affecting the craniofacial region (e.g., head and neck
cancer) through treatment modalities (e.g., surgery and chemo- and radiation therapy) or accidents (e.g.,
traffic, firearms, fireworks) often cause significant functional, structural, and esthetic damage to the face,
mouth, and cranium. The treatment of these conditions often is complex and involves the coordinated work of
the multidisciplinary craniofacial teams at clinics and centers providing comprehensive care for patients.
Despite recent advances in treatment options, the lack of knowledge in molecular mechanisms controlling
craniofacial development and regeneration remains a major obstacle in development of more sophisticated
therapies or more effective prevention of these conditions.
 The goal of this NIDCR Dental Specialty and PhD Program is to help ensure that a diverse pool of well-
trained scientists is available to address the nation’s biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research needs. We
are confident that this goal is achievable through programs that incorporate effective recruitment, advanced
scientific and clinical training, superb mentors, and an outstanding training environment. We leverage our
existing and highly successful Oral Health Sciences PhD program and the well-established, accredited clinical
specialty programs at the School of Dentistry to provide a pipeline of experts with advanced scientific and
clinical training. Specifically, this 7-year program offers PhD training with required and elective courses,
research rotations, dissertation research and career and leadership development, coupled with clinical
specialty training that supports scholars’ scientific and career plans. We propose to support our existing two
scholars, who are currently pursuing the integrated dental specialty and PhD training, until they transition to
other funding mechanisms during the second year of their specialty training. At that point, we will admit two
new scholars, who will be selected based on strong academic records, research accomplishments, and
commitment to a research-intensive academic career with a focus on craniofacial diseases and disorders and
support them as outlined above. We will make a special effort to recruit scholars from diverse and
underrepresented backgrounds.
 The University of Michigan and the School of Dentistry have a long tradition in graduate education, which
is both “student-centered and faculty led”. Our holistic view in graduate training not only prepares scholars for
professional challenges of the academic dentistry, but also furnishes them with skills and experiences to
become critical independent thinkers and life-long learners. This allows them to develop as master clinicians
with recognized independent research careers. Our goal is to educate a diverse and uniquely qualified
workforce that will accelerate our possibilities to prevent and treat craniofacial diseases and disorders."

Intercellular communication between tumor cells and stromal cells of which major components are
fibroblasts play a significant role in tumor growth, cancer progression and metastasis. This proposal
aims to investigate the role of STAT2 signaling in the exchange of communication between colorectal
cancer (CRC) cells and stromal cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the tumor microenvironment.
Our preliminary show that a clinical correlation between high STAT2 expression and poor survival as
well as a positive correlation between STAT2 and markers of CAFs. Analysis of tumor biopsies of CRC
patients showed elevated STAT2 protein in the tumor and surrounding stroma. Studies in two animal
models of CRC reveal that STAT2 is tumorigenic. RNA-Seq analysis exposed a transcriptional signature
associated with tumor associated fibroblasts. Furthermore, we found that STAT2 facilitates the
proliferation and invasion of tumor cells. In parallel, we found that induction of EGF expression in normal
fibroblasts was poorly induced after incubation with conditioned medium from STAT2 deficient tumor
cells. Given these observations, we postulate that STAT2 mediates the crosstalk between the
tumor and CAFs leading to CRC disease progression. The objective is to: (1) Determine whether
intrinsic tumor STAT2 signaling leads to reprogramming of normal fibroblasts to CAFs to promote tumor
growth and (2) Determine whether STAT2 signaling in normal fibroblasts leads to their conversion to
CAFs to enhance tumor growth. Completion of this study will reveal the importance of STAT2 signaling
in the tumor microenvironment as the communication axis (unidirectional vs. bidirectional) between
tumor cells and CAFs to enhance tumor growth, migration, and invasion.
Significance: Treatment of advanced CRC by combining targeted therapies with chemotherapy has
produced modest success. Delineating the oncogenic role of STAT2 signaling in the tumor
microenvironment may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies. If results from our study
reveal that STAT2 plays a dynamic role in the establishment of cell-to-cell communication in the tumor
microenvironment, our findings will support a rationale to inhibit STAT2 signaling as a therapeutic
intervention for the treatment of metastatic CRC."

Dementia is a condition affecting thinking, judgment, memory and other cognitive domains to the degree
that interferes with performing everyday activities. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of
dementia. In 2021, an estimated 6.2 million adults in the US aged ≥65 have dementia, and the number is
projected to be nearly 14 million by 2060. Women a have significantly higher risk of AD than men. About
two thirds of patients with dementia are women. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), representing the early
stage of the disease, refers to a state in which the patient experiences a decline in short-term memory, or
other cognitive domain, but with no significant impairment in everyday functioning. Though dementia mostly
affects older adults, it is not a part of normal aging. Given that taking prevention at the early stage of MCI
delays the development of the disease. It is of tremendous important to detect MCI during the early pre-
symptomatic stage. Several studies observed that vascular, metabolic disorders, and inflammation are
associated with risk of MCI, AD and AD related dementia (AD/ADRD). However, research gaps remain: (1)
inconsistent findings were observed from the previous studies. (2) Large-scale population-based studies for
AD and dementia risk are limited. (3) Although it is known that the risk of MCI and dementia are associated
with changes in risk exposures, few studies tested the association between time-varying exposures and risk
of outcomes. In the application, we aim at filling these gaps by using a rigorous study design to test the
predictive values of vascular and metabolic disorders, inflammation, as well as genetic factors for the risk of
incident MCI and dementia, and then develop a novel cumulative (combined) prediction index. We have 2
specific aims. Aim 1: To examine the association of vascular, metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers
with risk of incident MCI and dementia in older women. Hypothesis: vascular, metabolic and
inflammatory biomarkers, with time-varying measures significantly predict the risk of incident MCI and
dementia in women aged 65-79, and these associations are modified by APOE gene (ε4 versus the other
alleles). Aim 2: To develop a machine learning (ML)-enabled algorithm to predict individuals who are
at high risk of incident MCI and dementia. Hypothesis: A novel and advanced risk prediction model (e.g.,
a multi-dimensional risk model using ML) that integrates predictive values of multiple risk factors and key
covariates, will enhance the degree of the prediction for the risk of incident MCI and dementia.
The proposed study addresses a significant public health challenge facing an aging population. The
proposed study is innovative, characterized by (1) focusing on sex-specific study in older women; (2)
addressing time-varying risk factors that may have significant predictive effects on the study outcomes. (3)
We will test whether there are potential modification effects of APOE on the association between the study
of exposures and outcomes. The scientifically promising aspects of the study are the fact that it is able to
test the natural development of MCI and dementia using data from an unique large-scale population-based
study, the Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study. Findings of the study will be disseminated through
scientific meetings and research articles published in high impact journals, and add new insights into the
prevention and control of MCI and dementia."

Crohn’s disease (CD) is a chronic immune-mediated gastrointestinal disease characterized by significant
clinical and molecular heterogeneity. The clinical heterogeneity is evidenced by the wide variation in disease
location, severity, and behavior. The molecular heterogeneity is evidenced by the numerous genetic risk loci
which have been identified to date. Fortunately, there are an increasing number of therapeutic options for the
treatment of CD including blockade of tumor necrosis factor  and blockade of IL-12/23 signaling.
Unfortunately, patients rapidly cycle through medications, often due to lack of response, further increasing
morbidity and healthcare costs. Therefore, there is an urgent need for data matching the mechanism of the
disease to the treatment target to guide treatment selection. Our long-term goal is to improve first-line therapy
selection in CD as more therapies become available at biosimilar prices. In this career development proposal, I
will focus on acquiring data which provides a deeper understanding of the clinical and molecular attributes
which associate with response to anti-IL-12/23 therapy to improve drug positioning and first-line therapy
selection for this class of therapy in CD. We have shown that CD patients with autoimmune skin disease
preferentially respond to anti-IL-12/23 therapy. We will utilize machine learning to identify additional clinical
patterns which associate with preferential response to therapy, then develop a decision tool to aid clinicians in
selection of patients for first-line anti-IL-12/23 therapy. Then, we will investigate genomic predictors of
response using both a targeted and genome wide approach. Finally, we will identify transcriptional modules
which associate with drug response which will yield insight into the tissue cell signatures which associate with
differential response. The scientific and training objectives outlined will provide me with the expertise needed to
pursue independent investigation in the field of precision medicine, with a specific emphasis on the utilization
of large scale clinical and genomic datasets to predict prognostic and therapeutic outcomes in CD."
10828001,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Reducing polypharmacy by discontinuing medications with reduced benefits and increased risks is a priority in
older adults (OAs) with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). Low-dose aspirin for primary or
secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) has been proposed as a target for
discontinuation, with limited real-world data suggesting high variation in prescribing and discontinuation.
Guidelines recommend against aspirin for primary prevention in OAs, while supporting its use for secondary
prevention; however, applicability to OAs with ADRD is questionable. Reduced life expectancy for OAs with
ADRD may translate into lower long-term ASCVD benefits, while increased potential for drug interactions may
increase short-term bleeding risk. On the other hand, higher ASCVD risk among OAs with ADRD may position
them for greater risk of ASCVD events previously observed in other populations in weeks after discontinuing
aspirin, and the anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic effects of aspirin could also protect against further
progression of cognitive or functional decline. The exclusion of OAs with ADRD from randomized trials of
aspirin and limited availability of observational data on aspirin use (a non-prescription drug) leaves patients,
providers, and caregivers with little evidence about benefits and harms to guide informed decisions about
aspirin discontinuation. Our long-term goal is to improve decision-making, care quality, and outcomes for OAs
with ADRD, through improved evidence and treatment guidelines about medications optimization as ADRD
progresses. The proposed retrospective cohort study will use records on daily aspirin use uniquely
available for a national cohort of Veterans Affairs (VA) nursing home (NH) residents with ADRD, linked to
Minimum Data Set (MDS) assessments, electronic health records, and VA and Medicare utilization data over
2016-2023. Specific aims are to (1) Identify clinical and socio-environmental factors predicting aspirin
discontinuation in OAs with ADRD after NH admission, stratified by ASCVD status; (2) Examine effects of
discontinuing aspirin on ASCVD events, major bleeding, emergency department/hospital admissions, and
mortality, stratified by ASCVD status; and (3) Examine effects of discontinuing aspirin on cognitive function,
functional dependence, and behavioral/psychological symptoms of dementia. To focus our aims on generating
robust, clinically- and policy-relevant evidence, we will use pharmacoepidemiologic methods to reduce
selection bias and confounding. Aim 2 is a prevalent new-user study applying covariate balancing methods and
competing risk models, with supplementary analyses to address time-varying aspirin exposure and
confounders. Aim 3 will assess time-varying exposures and confounding using inverse-probability-weighted
marginal structural models. This study will inform future practice guidelines to address if aspirin can be safely
discontinued in OAs with ADRD and empower patients, caregivers, and providers to make informed decisions."
10895290,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Over the last few decades, obesity-associated metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance, type-2
diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases, have become a major health burden, affecting up to a quarter of U.S.
adults. Chronic, low-grade inflammation of the visceral adipose tissue (VAT), which eventually leads to
systemic inflammation, is a major driver of obesity-induced metabolic abnormalities. However, the mechanisms
of the initiation and progression of obesity-induced inflammation are still poorly understood. A unique
population of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) with a distinct antigen receptor repertoire and transcriptional
profile accumulates in VAT of lean male mice and estrogen-deficient female mice, keeps the inflammation in
check, and promotes metabolic health. Obesity, however, leads to significant reduction of VAT Tregs and loss
of their distinct features, resulting in elevated inflammation and worsened metabolic outcomes. This obesity-
induced toxicity severely hinders the development of VAT-Treg-targeted strategies against metabolic
disorders. The overall goal of this proposed project is to use novel genetic and biochemical tools to uncover
the unique cytokine, metabolic, and sex-hormone-mediated mechanisms that control the homeostasis of VAT
Tregs at steady state, and to investigate how disruption of these pathways could contribute to obesity-induced
toxicity of VAT Tregs in both males and estrogen-deficient females. By tracing the dynamics and transcriptomic
changes of Tregs residing in the epidydimal VAT (eVAT) in a diet-induced obesity model, we identified that the
reduction of eVAT Tregs during long-term high-fat-diet (HFD) feeding is associated with induction of a type I
IFN signature and a concurrent loss of transcripts involved in the synthesis and uptake of cholesterol. Further
experiments showed that eVAT Tregs preferentially depend on cholesterol homeostasis, which is inhibited by
obesity-induced type I IFNs. In addition, we identified that VAT Tregs from female mice respond to obesity
differently from males in an estrogen-dependent manner. Building on these observations, we will elucidate the
mechanisms that control VAT Treg homeostasis and their response to obesity through three specific aims:
In Aim 1, we will elucidate the mechanisms by which elevated type I IFNs drive the decline of eVAT Tregs and
promote metabolic abnormalities during obesity.
In Aim 2, we will determine the specific role of cholesterol homeostasis in eVAT Tregs and how its perturbation
contributes to the dysregulation of eVAT Tregs during obesity.
In Aim 3, we will elucidate how VAT Tregs respond to obesity in females with disrupted estrogen signaling.
These efforts will support our long-term goal to better understand the mechanisms that drive immune
dysregulation in obesity-associated chronic diseases."

The prevalence of functional impairment – defined as having difficulty or needing help to perform one or more
activities of daily living (ADLs) – is increasing among middle-aged adults in the U.S. Of the 80 million
Americans ages 45-64, more than 16% report difficulty performing one or more ADLs, and this percentage has
grown 3 percentage points over the past 15 years. The reasons for worsening functional status in middle age
are not yet fully understood. However, it is part of a larger trend of worsening health in this age group. Since
1990, the prevalence of chronic conditions has increased in middle-aged people, including diabetes, obesity,
cardiovascular disease, and depression. The risk of premature mortality has also increased, particularly among
those with less than a high school education. These findings raise the concern that middle-aged Americans are
experiencing accelerated aging that is causing premature functional impairment. If this is the case, middle-
aged adults with functional impairment could experience persistent functional problems and associated poor
health outcomes, similar to older adults. However, studies showing the growing prevalence of functional
impairment in middle age have serial cross-sectional designs and do not evaluate trajectories of function or
long-term effects on health outcomes. What we need to know is whether functional trajectories are worsening
in middle age, what the risk factors are for adverse trajectories, and which trajectories predict poor health
outcomes later in life. A longitudinal study that observes people from middle age through older age is needed
to address these gaps. The aims of the proposed project are to: (1) examine the trajectories of functional
impairment among middle-aged adults in the U.S.; (2) identify risk and protective factors to explain differences
in functional trajectories; and (3) measure the impact of functional trajectories in middle age on later-life health
and economic outcomes. We will complete these aims using longitudinal nationally representative data from
the NIA-funded Health and Retirement Study linked to rich contextual measures of the physical and social
environment, objective physical performance measures and lab data, and administrative data. This study will
have two impacts: informing prevention of functional impairment in middle age by providing data to support
next-step development and testing of interventions to improve functional outcomes; and informing policy
planning to mitigate the projected burden of functional impairment and associated adverse outcomes."

We propose to renew our global cardiometabolic disease (GCMD) predoctoral training program. This cross-
disciplinary nutrition-focused program provides specialized training to develop a cadre of researchers who
can bridge basic, translational, and population science to reduce the growing burden and disparities in
GCMD. There is critical need to reduce this burden in low- and middle-income countries that are
disproportionately affected and where more specialized skills and global leadership are most needed. The
training program is administered in the Department of Nutrition in the Gillings School of Global Public Health
and in the UNC School of Medicine, a logical and well-placed home for a GCMD training grant. Nutrition
science integrates “omics” (e.g., genomics, proteomics, metabolomics), behavioral, and population
approaches and data to understand complex pathobiological processes and underlying causes of population
health differences in GCMD, thus providing a strong platform for training translational global researchers in
this field. Our program is co-directed by two senior faculty with strong mentoring records and extensive
global experience and leadership in GCMD research. The program is guided by an internal training
committee and an external advisory board. Our 22 UNC training faculty are scientists with substantial
research support, excellent publication records across a wide range of disciplines, and strong mentoring
experience. We request support for 5 predoctoral trainees per year. Trainees complete the PhD in nutrition
and GCMD program-specific requirements, including specialized courses in global health and
cardiovascular disease and options for in-depth training in (1) specialized methods important for GCMD, (2)
translational medicine, or (3) implementation science. All trainees participate in a seminar led by the program
directors, mentored research practicums, training in the responsible conduct of research, and mentoring for
professional development, including submitting an NIH-style predoctoral and/or F award or similar
application for extramural funding, and unique global internships with 15 global mentors who are exceptional
CMD researchers working at 13 top universities or research centers in 11 countries. Our training program
stands out because of its: (1) focus on nutrition, a major etiologic factor in the global disease burden; (2) life
course approach to addressing GCMD; (3) interdisciplinary focus on causes ranging from cellular and
molecular to whole organism and accounting for underlying social, economic, political, and environmental
determinants; (4) emphasis on integration and translation of basic knowledge and discoveries from nutrition
biochemistry, physiology, genetics, and epidemiology, to behavioral and environmental approaches and
policies; and (5) outstanding faculty mentors who serve as role models for excellence in GCMD research
and leaders working with countries to implement and evaluate large-scale regulatory efforts to prevent
cardiometabolic disease. The program is training future leaders in GCMD research."

This project continues the development of the UniProt Knowledgebase, which aims to provide the scientific
community with a comprehensive, high-quality, and freely accessible resource of protein sequences and
functional information. Proteins are an essential bridge between human genetics, the environment and
phenotype. While human genetics has increasing power to find correlations between genotype and phenotype,
knowledge of how proteins function, provided by UniProt, is essential for the mechanistic understanding critical
to develop health outcomes through improved and personalized diagnostics, prognostics, and treatments.
Biomedical research is being revolutionized by methods from the field of Artificial Intelligence, particularly
Machine Learning (ML) approaches such as Deep Learning (DL). These approaches now outstrip the ability of
humans in many fields and are state-of-the-art when sufficient data is available. UniProt provides gold standard
training data for hundreds of ML applications in biomedical research. The work in this proposal will enhance the
readiness of UniProt for use in ML and will integrate ML methods to enhance our efficiency.
UniProt curators extract and synthesize experimental knowledge of proteins from papers in human and machine-
readable forms using a range of standard ontologies. This proposal will further structure protein knowledge in
UniProt, developing complete, machine-readable catalogs of the functional impact of human variation and of
human protein networks and complexes, essential to understanding human disease. Efficiency of curation will
be improved using DL models, developed in collaboration with text mining experts, to automate the identification
of relevant papers and accelerate extraction of knowledge. This extracted knowledge will be validated by our
expert curators and also the wider research community who will be actively engaged to further scale curation.
ML approaches will also be used to infer annotations for proteins with no experimental characterization, using
community challenges to develop faster, more accurate, scalable approaches to annotate the deluge of
uncharacterized proteins.
UniProt is an exemplar FAIR resource and has served the scientific community with metronomic data releases
despite an exponential growth in data volumes. Streamlined production processes will scale efficiently and
sustainably with both the growing data volume and complexity. We will explore novel technologies to ensure the
continued timely release of data to the community according to the FAIR principles.
UniProt is an international hub of protein data that serves hundreds of thousands of users annually. We will
continue using user-centric approaches to develop the UniProt website in response to user needs and new data
types. We will engage with our stakeholders and collaborators by introducing an annual strategic partnership
meeting. We will engage our communities through webinars, social media, hackathons and attendance at
scientific meetings to broaden the efficient and impactful use of our data."

Enhancers play a vital role in initiating and maintaining expression of cell specific transcriptional programs. A
key feature in enhancer activation and gene regulation is changing the local chromatin state to facilitate binding
of transcriptional co-regulators to enhancers. Chromatin-modifying enzymes that are associated with enhancer
function are commonly mutated in human craniofacial disorders including histone methylases, demethylases,
acetylases, chromatin readers, and chromatin remodeling proteins. Many of these chromatin-modifying factors
biochemically associate and may co-regulate enhancer and transcriptional activation events within neural
crest, stem cells from which anterior facial bone and cartilage are derived. We have modeled several of these
human craniofacial disorders through tissue specific knockout of chromatin-modifying factors in mouse neural
crest cells. The experiments outlined in this proposal will characterize de novo enhancer activation by
chromatin profiling of primary cranial neural crest cells undergoing osteoblast differentiation. Neural crest cells
deficient in chromatin-modifying machinery will be analyzed molecularly for disruption of enhancer chromatin
states and to identify cooperative functions between these factors. This proposal will utilize a combination of
biochemical, genetic, and low cell number genomic approaches to elucidate the role of chromatin-based
enhancer activation in craniofacial disorder pathogenesis."

A critical gap in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Alzheimer’s disease related disorders (ADRD) clinical research
is the vast under-under-representation of Black/African American (AA) older adults. It is well-documented that
AD+ADRD is more prevalent in AA individuals relative to white individuals of European ancestry. Early
detection of AD+ADRD is critical for clinical trials aiming to develop optimal therapeutics. Without adequate
representation of AA in cognitive and biomarker studies examining the earliest changes in AD+ADRD, the
diagnostic, prognostic, and clinical utility of promising biomarkers and their effects on cognition cannot be
established. Therefore, there is a pressing need to include and deeply phenotype AAs using novel cognitive
and biomarker assessments that consider the multiple co-morbidities identified in this population.
Study location has been identified as one of the most prevalent enrollment barriers for AA older adults. This
current research proposal leverages our vast expertise in conducting home-based assessment to evaluate
clinical and neuropsychological status with equipment that we place within the home. Importantly, we will
provide door-to-door transportation for MRI and amyloid PET imaging studies that we have successfully
employed to recruit and retain culturally diverse older adults including AA, with and without cognitive
impairment into biomarker studies. This will facilitate a user-friendly and effective approach that supports the
engagement of AA older adults. Other important and innovative aspects of our proposed study include: a) the
use of our novel Cognitive Challenge Tests (CCTs) that employ sensitive and specific cognitive assessment
paradigms that have been associated to biomarkers of AD and neurodegeneration, and have been validated
for use in AA older adults with and without Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI); b) use of state-of-the-science
plasma-based markers of AD and neurodegeneration that leverage extremely sensitive SiMoA technology;
c) we will uniquely relate our novel CCTs at baseline and longitudinally to changes over time in serially
collected plasma biomarkers (e.g., p-tau181, p-tau217, NfL, GFAP), d) comparison of plasma markers of AD and
neurodegeneration with amyloid PET imaging and extra-cellular free water diffusion as well as
neurodegenerative changes on MRI; e) accounting for the comorbidity of common chronic conditions in
the AA population, we will obtain sensitive measures of cerebrovascular disease, inflammation, diabetes and
metabolic risk, as well as chronic kidney disease; f) structural and social determinants of health will also be
assessed. The deep phenotyping of 270 non-Hispanic AA older adults in the proposed research study
and our resource sharing plan will accelerate efforts to gain critically needed knowledge of AD+ADRD
in a seriously underrepresented AA group. The data obtained will promote the reproducibility of this work in
extant databases that include AA and can facilitate comparison of findings with non-AA samples. This
important cohort will continue to be followed throughout the funding period and beyond."

Executive functions are high-level supervisory cognitive skills vital for a child’s social and academic success.
Their core components include working memory, inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility. The development of
executive functions in children can be adversely affected by many early life risk factors, such as lead exposure
and low socioeconomic status. However, there are two difficulties to precisely measuring and modeling
executive functions, which hamper our understanding of how risk factors can predict shifts in executive
functioning: 1) It is common to use a single child performance task to tap into an executive function
component. While this can yield important information, it can also lead to bias, because executive functions
can be difficult to measure precisely, since they are interdependent and also rely on non-executive function
skills. 2) It can be challenging to model the longitudinal development of executive functions because the set of
tasks used to assess executive functions can change as a child grows. Some tasks may be specific to a
particular age range and not appropriate for other ages. To address the first difficulty, we will improve the
precision of measuring an executive function component by using well-established latent variable approaches
which integrate output from multiple tasks. Preliminary analyses demonstrate that this approach can yield
improved interpretability of a risk factor’s impact on an executive function component, compared to separate
analyses of each task. To address the second difficulty, we propose to use advanced psychometric and item
response theory methods to create a longitudinal scale of executive functioning with optimized precision and
construct validity that span all the ages of interest. This will allow us to identify how risk factors can predict
changes in executive function over time (e.g. developmental trajectory). This proposal leverages data from two
large, NIH-funded prospective birth cohorts with extensive longitudinal data and repeated assessments of
many executive function tasks, and detailed measures of risk factors (e.g. lead exposure, low socioeconomic
status). Open-source, user-friendly software for the developed approaches will be developed, including a web
application for non-statistical users. I (Dr. Shelley Liu) am a biostatistician and an Assistant Professor in
Population Health Science and Policy at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS). ISMMS
provides an excellent environment for this K25; all mentors and advisory committee members are based at
ISMMS. My training will involve 1) formal graduate level coursework on executive function development, child
neuropsychology, item response theory and psychometric scaling; 2) tutorials in neurodevelopment and
psychometrics with my mentoring team; and 3) clinical rotations to observe neurobehavioral assessments. This
training will complement my existing expertise in biostatistics. I aim to become an independent, R01-funded
researcher studying child neurodevelopment and associated risk factors."

Understanding the transcriptional programs governing cell identity and function is key to many outstanding
questions in biology and biomedicine. Most variants associated with common diseases and traits lie in non-
coding, regulatory regions of the genome, and to interpret their function, we need to identify the genes they affect
and how those are expressed in the different cells of a tissue within individuals, and quantify how their expression
varies across individuals. How these mechanisms are regulated during human development remains poorly
understood, and most studies to date have relied on human cell lines or model organisms as proxies. GTEx did
not profile tissues from postnatal stages of human development. Regulatory elements and gene networks are
highly cell type–specific, and may only be active during precise developmental stages, during which they may
also contribute to disease susceptibility. Thus, there is a critical need for measuring the transcriptional and
regulatory landscape of tissues and cell types during human development.
 We will serve as the LDACC for the creation of the developmental GTEx (dGTEx) resource. (1) We will
work with the BPC to establish a biobank of 30 tissues from each of 120 human postnatal postmortem donors,
consented for broad research use and data sharing. (2) We will select 4 tissues of importance for common
diseases, and in which there is tissue remodelling during development - brain, gut, lung and heart. We will profile
these tissues with multiple single cell assays including snRNA-seq, multiomic RNA/ATAC, and spatial
transcriptomics to create deep molecular maps for variant characterization. (3) We will perform baseline
molecular profiling of genome sequence and bulk transcriptome for all samples, and integrate the resource with
GTEx. We will use these collective data to identify e/sQTLs; create maps of element-gene relationships across
tissues; chart differentiation hierarchies within tissues and across age ranges; nominate cell types in which a set
of variants manifest; and map cellular and spatial relationships among cells, cellular programs, and tissue
features.
 This project brings together a team with expertise in human genetics, production science (GTEx,
ENCODE), computational biology, single cell technologies, and common disease genetics. We will create a data
and biospecimen resource for the scientific community that will underpin studies to understand cellular and tissue
changes during human development, genome regulation, and common disease variant interpretation."

The proposed research aims to reduce obesity-related health disparities by promoting healthy lifestyle behav-
iors among African Americans (AAs), given the high disease burdens associated with low physical activity, in-
sufficient sleep, and obesity. To this end, the candidate will seek to understand how social contextual factors
impact sleep by using qualitative interviews and an existing quantitative data sets (K99). Knowledge gained
from the K99 phase will inform the adaptation and testing of an existing sleep intervention (MDACC IRB Proto-

obese, sedentary, and short-sleeping AA adults; and (Aim 2) empirically testing the associations between so-
cial contextual factors, sleep, physical activity, and body weight using data from an ongoing studies of AAs
(Project FAITH; American Cancer Society, RSG-17-158-01; PI: Dr. McNeill, mentor). Lastly, during the R00
phase will compile the knowledge gained in the K99 phase to adapt a sleep intervention and test its feasibility,
satisfaction, and preliminary efficacy in improving sleep, increasing physical activity, and decreasing sedentary
behavior among overweight/obese, sedentary, and sleep-deprived AA adults (Aim 3). The candidate is
uniquely positioned to complete the proposed research based on his past clinical experience in treating insom-

approach to optimizing psychological and physical wellness to reduce obesity and cancer-related health dis-
parities – a research priority at the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities. Furthermore,
the proposed training plan will be critical in expediting the candidate’s transition to an independent investigator
with focused expertise in developing culturally informed interventions to reduce cancer health disparities
among AAs."

Neuropeptides have a critical role in modulating sleep and wakefulness and offer unique opportunities to treat
sleep disorders. Among them, Neuropeptide S shows outstanding features: i) Administration of NPS increases
wakefulness and reduces anxiety; ii) Neuropeptide S knockout mice show display increased NREM and anxiety;
iii) Mutations of the NPS receptor that give rise to overactive signaling result in short sleep in humans and mice;
iv) Expression of NPS is restricted to a few thousand neurons distributed across five main clusters in the
basomedial amygdala, dorsomedial thalamus, Kolliker-Fuse/parabrachial area, pericoerulear region and nucleus
incertus. These regions have been directly or indirectly associated with arousal and anxiety, but the detailed
mechanisms as to how the modulate sleep architecture are unknown. We have recently generated a new line
of mice expressing cre recombinase under the control of the endogenous NPS gene promoter (NPS-IRES-cre
mice). Here we propose to use these mice and a combination of circuit mapping tools to decipher the
mechanisms by which NPS modulates sleep/wake cycle. First, we will use viral-mediated tracing to determine if
the five clusters of NPS+ neurons are interconnected, and their anatomical relationship with known arousal
circuits. In a second aim, we will use fiber photometry to determine the activity profiles of the five clusters of
NPS cells across the sleep/wake cycle and in response to stress and positive emotional stimuli. We will also
determine which arousal circuits are activated by optogenetic stimulation of NPS, and which circuits activate
NPS neurons. We will also assess whether NPS stimulation affects locomotor activity, anxiety, core body
temperature and other physiological variables that may confound the arousal effect. In aim 3, we will test
whether individual clusters of NPS neurons are necessary for NPS’s effects on sleep by using opto and
chemogenetic inhibition. Finally, we will use a CRISPR-based approach to introduce NPS gene mutations in
individual NPS+ cell clusters and determine whether NPS release in these brain regions is essential to control
sleep/wake architecture and anxiety behaviors.
The results from these experiments will shed new light into the function of NPS and NPS+ neurons, as well as
the interconnection between them and arousal circuits. These data may lead to improved treatments of
neuropsychiatric disorders associated with imbalances in arousal systems."
11115539,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is one of the most common service-related mental health conditions
among all treatment-seeking Veterans, and the critical lack of advancement in pharmacological treatment of
this disorder has recently been termed an urgent crisis by leaders in the field. The absence of progress in
developing more effective treatments targeting PTSD stems from an inability to objectively characterize
behavioral dysfunction related to PTSD symptoms and link it directly to underlying neural process dysfunction
that can be targeted with medications. One of the most encouraging recent developments in the
psychopharmacology of PTSD was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) showing that the norepinephrine (NE)
and dopamine (DA) reuptake inhibitor methylphenidate (MPH) was associated with a remarkably robust
reduction in PTSD symptoms, but the effects of MPH on complex behaviors remains poorly understood, and
improved understanding of its mechanism in PTSD will be crucial for individualized patient selection and for
development of new interventions targeting similar mechanisms. This application seeks to integrate (a) a
computational psychiatry approach with (b) pharmacological intervention with MPH and (c) functional
neuroimaging to characterize a complex pharmacologic mechanism in PTSD and assist the development of
process- and neural circuit-specific interventions for Veterans with this disabling condition.
 A core feature across multiple PTSD symptom clusters is a failure to appropriately modulate the salience of
cues according to environmental context. MPH, via its NE and DA actions, is known to improve modulation of
salience according to context in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), suggesting a similar
mechanism may underlie its efficacy in PTSD. The failure of contextual salience regulation in PTSD spans
multiple symptom domains, indicating the value of a unifying computational psychopharmacology approach to
salience that can go beyond description of disparate symptoms and measure a core underlying process
dysfunction and its improvement with MPH. Accumulating evidence indicates that a computational surprise-
driven learning paradigm can quantitatively operationalize the deficit in salience modulation as a failure to
scale surprise according to environmental volatility (rate of change): (1) In healthy subjects, environmental
volatility scales surprise-driven learning via brain NE and DA; this process is impaired in anxious individuals.
(2) Our own preliminary data indicate that individuals with PTSD exhibit exaggerated surprise-driven learning in
a stable environment. (3) Our own preliminary data indicate that MPH enhances the influence of environmental
volatility on surprise-driven learning in healthy subjects. (4) Our own preliminary fMRI data in a sample of
combat Veterans indicates that PTSD symptoms are associated with exaggerated activation to surprise in a
salience-sensitive region in the posterior parietal cortex in a stable environment.
 The present application seeks to apply computational modeling and functional neuroimaging to examine
surprise-driven learning in a sample of Veterans with PTSD, administered a single dose of MPH and placebo
on separate testing sessions in randomized order, to characterize the mechanism of MPH in PTSD. This is an
application of computational psychopharmacology, which promises to help address the crisis in
psychopharmacology of PTSD in Veterans by specifying new mechanistic targets for intervention, aiding the
development of novel interventions and targeting of optimal treatments to individual Veterans. In conjunction
with the Research Plan, the Career Plan and Mentoring Plan will allow the applicant to achieve independence
as a VA clinician-scientist using computational psychopharmacology and functional neuroimaging to develop
novel, personalized interventions for Veterans with PTSD and related disorders. The applicant will ultimately
develop a Merit application using similar methods to predict treatment response in Veterans with PTSD to help
enable a personalized medicine approach to this severely burdensome disorder."

Human genomes harbor significant variation both between and within individuals. Numerous studies have
explored inherited variation across human populations and linked various germline polymorphisms to human
traits and disease susceptibility. Genomic sequences also vary within an individual, occurring after zygote
formation and leading to variation present in a frequency spectrum ranging from individual cells to entire tissues.
This somatic mosaicism of genome variation has been well established in cells of phenotypically normal
individuals and has been shown to also be associated with some disease phenotypes, particularly cancers.
However, these investigations have been mostly limited to higher frequency mosaicism (e.g. >5-10% variant
allele frequency) due to technical limitations in both molecular assays and computational methodology.
Compounding these technological challenges is that each human tissue exhibits apparently different rates of
somatic mosaicism. For example, it is currently estimated that each cell within the human brain contains
hundreds to a few thousand somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and that a smaller fraction of cells harbor
somatic copy number variations (CNVs), mobile element insertions (MEIs), and short tandem repeat expansions
(STRs). In contrast, somatic mutation rates have been reported to be significantly higher in the large and small
intestines and lower in gastric and prostatic glands. These rates have been ascertained through a variety of
approaches, including SNP microarrays, bulk and single cell whole genome sequencing, and direct amplification
and sequencing of candidate events, each with its own advantages and limitations. However, there has yet to
be a systematic investigation of human somatic mosaicism across the entire frequency spectrum within human
tissues. Our team has extensive collective experience developing tools for identifying somatic mosaicism in the
human brain, including recent surveys of SNV prevalence from whole genome and exome sequencing, CNVs
from single cell short-read and nanopore genome sequencing, and retrotransposons through targeted capture.
Here, we propose to improve, optimize, and extend our approaches to other human tissues as part of
the SMaHT initiative, which will provide an excellent platform for systematically identifying, cataloging,
and exploring human somatic mosaicism across tissues. We will achieve this through two phases: in the
UG3 phase of this project, we will (1) improve molecular assays for nanopore targeted bulk capture and single
cell sequencing and (2) improve computational approaches for detecting somatic mosaicism from single cell and
bulk tissue data, while in the UH3 phase we will (3) optimize, benchmark, and validate molecular assays for high-
throughput application across human tissues and (4) improve efficiency, runtime, and structured reporting of
somatic variants. Collectively, these efforts will enhance our ability to detect at scale previously overlooked
classes of somatic variation and extend the size range and frequency spectrum for which they may be
ascertained."

The ocular surface is constantly exposed to the environment and is inhabited by several microbes.
The most commonly used methods for ocular surface microbiome characterization consist of
traditional microbiological culturing and, more recently, next-generation sequencing. Culture-based
methods provide information on absolute abundances but are limited in identifying only fast-growing
microorganisms on culture media and a large number of nonculturable microbes. Recent 16S rRNA
marker gene sequencing studies provide the most extensive and diverse characterization of the
ocular microbiome. This data suggests the existence of the resident ocular microbiome; however,
little is known about the core microbiome constituents of the anterior segment in a healthy population.
Furthermore, the optimal method of sample collection that will yield the most representative results
remains unclear. This study aims to implement whole-metagenome sequencing (WMS) and
metatranscriptomics sequencing methods optimized for low-biomass samples to characterize the
ocular microbiome inhabiting the anterior segment of the eye and their interaction with the immune
system in healthy adults. In this project, we will establish a large human cohort (n=500) and will
prospectively collect serial samples from inferior and superior conjunctival fornix from healthy adults
for a period of 1 year. In addition to characterizing the core ocular microbiome in healthy adults, we
will examine seasonal changes in the diversity and enrichment of specific microbial taxon (bacteria,
fungi, and viruses); ocular microbiome differences between sexes and different age groups (young
adults, middle age, and older adults). The metatranscriptomics data will enable us to profile active
microbial pathways (bacteria, fungi, and virus) and host epithelial (conjunctival) immune response for
underpinning associations between the microbiome and ocular immune modulation. The outcomes of
this study will contribute towards understanding the core microbial constituents in the anterior
segment and their role in immune interactions to maintain homeostasis."

Oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC), the most common subtype of head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC), is a devastating disease, causing substantial morbidity and mortality. Consumption of
alcohol and tobacco products increases the risk of OCSCC. Prevalence of human papilloma virus (HPV) infection
outside of oropharyngeal cancer is low, and its significance remains debatable. Only a handful of targeted
therapies are available for patients with HPV-negative HNSCC (which include many oral cavity cancers), and
the 5-year overall survival remains ~50%. While strategies are being designed to improve risk assessment,
detection, and therapeutic intervention, these approaches are limited by our incomplete understanding of
HNSCC biology, particularly in its early development. Thus, it is crucial to identify novel targets of therapeutic
interest.
PDCD10 is a multifaceted protein shown to be overexpressed in several solid malignancies. It was reported that
PCDC10 regulates numerous oncogenic pathways and may contribute to tumorigenesis and chemoresistance
by promoting cell proliferation, anti-apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and inhibiting anti-tumor
immune responses. Recently it was suggested that PDCD10 is involved in regulating cancer stem cells (CSCs)
maintenance in breast and lung cancers. In line with these observations, our studies suggest that PDCD10 plays
an important role in promoting Wnt/β-catenin mediated stem cell maintenance in small intestines. Notably,
preliminary data outlined below provide strong evidence for an equivalent role of PDCD10 in HNSCC, and
suggest that upregulation of its expression is an important event in neoplastic progression, posing PDCD10 as
a valuable prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target.
While PDCD10 is being actively studied in several preclinical settings, there is limited data on its role in head
and neck tumorigenesis. In this proposal we will use in vivo and organoid based preclinical models, coupled with
comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of longitudinally collected primary human specimens, to evaluate the role
of PDCD10 in HNSCC evolution and driving aggressive tumor cells behavior. Our project pursues three
independent Aims. Specifically: Aim 1 will use mice model with inducible Pdcd10 knockout in tongue epithelia
to evaluate the ability of PDCD10 depletion to inhibit oral cancerogenesis in vivo; Aim 2 will use human OCSCC
organoid models to assess the ability of PDCD10 to promote CSCs survival and self-renewal; while Aim 3 will
use a unique already existing RNA-Seq dataset of longitudinally collected oral dysplastic lesions and OCSCC
samples to delineate key PDCD10 dependent signaling pathways that drive malignant transformation.
Given the devastating nature of HPV- HNSCC and dearth of effective treatment approaches, providing new
insights into the cancer driving molecular mechanisms regulated by PDCD10 and using this knowledge for
developing therapeutic approaches targeting its activity may ultimately improve patient prognosis."

Radiation-associated dysphagia (RAD) is a leading driver of QOL and a potentially life-threatening survivorship
issue, afflicting more than half of patients treated with curative radiotherapy (RT) for oropharyngeal cancers
(OPC). Aspirators are almost 5-times more likely to develop pneumonia than non-aspirators, and pneumonia
confers a 42% increased risk of mortality among cancer survivors. Radiation fibrosis has long been considered
the primary driver of RAD, but the investigators’ preliminary work points to late cranial neuropathy as a major
contributor to truly severe forms of delayed or late-RAD. Cranial neuropathy (denervation) is clinically detected
a median of 5 to 8 years after RT after a “quiet period” of functional recovery. There is currently no early indicator
for this injury. Delayed identification means that muscle atrophy and profound functional injury is typically present
at the time of diagnosis, limiting therapeutic potential. The long-term goal of this work is to reduce dysphagia
burden through mechanistically and technically nimble surveillance algorithms as a major step toward
personalized management. Our central hypothesis is that subclinical hypoglossal neuropathy is prevalent and
associates with severity of RAD early in HNC survivorship and novel non-invasive lingual high density surface
electromyography (HDSEMG) is feasible for quantitative functional surveillance. The objective of the proposed
study is to analyze gold-standard needle EMG and experimental HDSEMG of the tongue as an optional procedure
in an existing large-scale OPC cohort and two clinical trial datasets that capture robust longitudinal swallowing
outcomes data to: 1) estimate prevalence of hypoglossal neuropathy along continuum of survivorship (diagnosis,
early, and late) after oropharyngeal radiation (Aim 1); 2) correlate EMG-detected hypoglossal neuropathy and
swallowing function over time before and after oropharyngeal radiation (Aim 2); and 3) examine feasibility of
HDSEMG as a rapid, non-invasive quantitative screening method for hypoglossal neuropathy (Aim 3). Building
upon the highly curated functional data from the MD Anderson OPC Patient-Reported Outcomes/Function
(PROF) Core and investigators’ track record of non-invasive signal measurement in the tongue, we are uniquely
positioned to accomplish these complementary aims. This high risk/high reward work could lead to practice-
change. We expect the outcomes to provide proof of concept that subclinical hypoglossal neuropathy is a
mechanism underlying RAD that can be measured with a novel, non-invasive device. Thus, providing data to
support a novel and measurable target (subclinical hypoglossal neuropathy) underlying a hugely impactful and
potentially deadly common toxicity –RAD– in a fast growing, young OPC survivor population."

Despite the progress made in precision oncology, clinicians typically face a vast volume and variety of next-
generation sequencing and molecular data that is frequently intuitively processed to support high-stakes
decisions. Overall, currently available resources that assist with next-generation sequence data interpretation
are limited by manually performed, complex, time-consuming, and error-prone gene queries and ultimately
lack the necessary information for prioritizing emerging therapies in a scalable manner. Importantly, the
integration of genomic with clinical data has been severely hampered by the lack of advanced analytical tools
that match genomic targets with molecularly-driven therapies. These barriers, together with health disparities,
widen the gap between an exponentially increasing drug development field and the actual benefits for
patients with cancer.
The overarching goal of the proposed research is to link clinical with computational precision oncology and
enable clinical decision-making in genomically defined groups. We propose to develop a precision oncology
decision support framework for automated, scalable, and precise matching of actionable next-generation
sequencing findings with targeted therapies. We will then test its clinical utility and value in the several clinical
settings within the Johns Hopkins Molecular Tumor Board, in Johns Hopkins partnering community medical
centers as well within two ongoing clinical trials for women with breast cancer. To enhance the generalizability
of our analytical toolkit past our local academic environment, we have designed the platform's architecture
such that it allows for ingestion and harmonization of next-generation sequence data from multiple sources,
implements a common data model to map clinical elements to standardized terminologies and leverages
ensemble natural language processing to generate actionable mutation-targeted therapy pairs. These
attributes provide the foundation for the toolkit's potential widespread use and implementation in health care
settings outside our local academic environment.
While significant advances have been made in advanced diagnostics for tumor profiling, a solid backbone
that supports the practical implementation within and across health care systems is lacking. The underlying
premise of the proposed research is that it will ignite cross-institutional real-world genomic data analysis
initiatives and genotype-driven clinical trials that will be beneficial for health systems and patients. Notably,
our precision oncology decision support platform will enhance the implementation of precision oncology at
institutions that do not readily have access to in-house expertise in clinical genomics. We envision that this
streamlined automatic and scalable process will improve care, enhance patient outcomes and define national
standards in how treatments are selected and tailored to individual patients."
10782549,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Bacterial pneumonia causes severe local inflammation in the lungs that can result in serious complications if left
unchecked. While antibiotics are oftentimes an effective treatment, drug-resistant bacteria that do not respond
to the standard of care represent a major threat. Bacteria contain a number of pathogen-associated molecular
patterns that are highly efficient at activating the immune system, and the overproduction of proinflammatory
factors can have deleterious effects such as causing the air sacs within the lungs to become filled with fluid. To
address these negative effects, corticosteroids have been employed as an adjunct therapy in combination with
antibiotic treatment. There is clinical evidence that supplemental anti-inflammatories can reduce patient morbidity
and mortality, and the beneficial effects are the most pronounced in cases of severe disease. Despite their
advantages, steroids are broadly immunosuppressive and cannot be administered at high dosages or over
extended periods of time without side effects. In this proposal, our goal is to employ a genetic engineering
approach for creating a next-generation a cellular nanoparticle (CNP) platform that can specifically target sites
of inflammation. CNPs are an emerging class of nanocarrier that utilize the principles of biomimicry, and they
have demonstrated considerable promise for drug delivery applications. Their fabrication involves the coating of
synthetic nanoparticulate cores with naturally derived cellular membrane, which provides an inherently
multifunctional and multi-antigenic layer of camouflage. We will further advance the CNP concept by genetically
engineering the nanoparticles to express specific membrane-bound targeting proteins. Leveraging the fact that
activated endothelial cells at sites of inflammation upregulate their expression of cell adhesion molecules, CNPs
will be fabricated using cell membrane that has been engineered to express the cognate ligands. Each
inflammation-targeting CNP formulation will be loaded with corticosteroids, delivering the payloads precisely to
where they are most needed. By improving the therapeutic index of these drugs, we hope to prevent the harmful
effects associated with excessive inflammation while reducing any treatment-related side effects. If successful,
this approach could potentially be applied across a wide range of inflammation-driven pathologies."
10775833,"SUMMARY
The important role of adaptive immunity in cardiovascular disease (CVD) is established. However, much is still
unknown regarding how adaptive immunity can be manipulated to benefit CVD outcomes. Atherosclerosis, the
most common form of CVD, is characterized by accumulation of lipid and immune cells in the artery wall that
leads to plaque formation. Recent single cell RNAseq data in human atherosclerotic confirm that T cells make
up a large fraction of the cell population in lesions. T cells are important to the atherosclerotic process as
effector T cells (Th1 and Th17) seem to promote plaque growth and instability whereas regulatory T cells
(Tregs) are critical for inhibition of atherogenesis and induce regression of established plaques. In humans, Tregs
are associated with plaque stability and protection against cardiac events. These data are consistent with
mouse models that show Tregs numbers in plaques decrease as atherosclerosis progresses and remaining Tregs
Th1-like inflammatory phenotype. Why Tregs dedifferentiate or become dysfunctional in atherosclerosis is not
completely understood, but recent studies suggest that oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) may play a
functional role in this process. Preliminary studies from our laboratory examined whether oxidized phospholipid
(oxPAPC), associated with atherosclerosis and oxLDL, could affect Treg differentiation, stability, and function.
Our preliminary data show that, oxPAPC reduced Treg viability and increased expression of the Th1-associated
transcription factor T-bet and production of IFN- thus promoting the Th1-like Treg phenotype. This effect was
Treg-specific as cells skewed in Th1 or Th17 conditions were not affected by oxPAPC. These oxPAPC Tregs
were also less suppressive in vitro. The effect of oxPAPC on Tregs was partially dependent on CD36 and IFN-.
Interestingly, IFN- has been shown to destabilize Tregs in the tumor microenvironment and data in this proposal
show that neutralization of IFN- in Treg skewing cultures inhibits expression of T-bet in FoxP3+ cells. Therefore,
we hypothesize that oxidized phospholipids associated with atherosclerosis induce an effector-
phenotype in Tregs that is partially dependent on IFN-. To test this hypothesis we propose two specific
aims. The first will examine the role of CD36/TLR and IFN- signaling on the dysregulation of Tregs in the
presence of oxPLs and determine if these Tregs can protect from atherosclerosis in vivo. The second, will
examine whether CD36 or responses to IFN- are responsible for destabilization of the Treg compartment
during atherosclerosis in vivo. This work will uncover novel information on the role of oxidized phospholipid on
Treg dysfunction in atherosclerosis and will provide valuable insight for future clinical interventions."

 This application to RFA HL-23-001 proposes a California Clinical Center for participation in the Acute
Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), Pneumonia, and Sepsis (APS) Consortium study. Our Clinical Center
consists of 4 sites: University of California, San Francisco (UCSF; lead site); UCSF Fresno; Zuckerberg San
Francisco General Hospital; and Stanford University. Our Clinical Center will contribute to the design and
conduct of the APS Consortium’s prospective, longitudinal observational cohort study which will enroll 5000
adults with ARDS, pneumonia, and/or sepsis overall, with follow up of approximately half of survivors at 3, 6 and
12 months. We will enroll 1000 participants in this Consortium during the project period and work with our
colleagues on the APS Consortium Steering Committee to design and implement the project. Our 4 sites have
a strong track record of working well together to enroll a diverse population of critically ill patients with ARDS,
pneumonia, and sepsis in interventional trials and observational studies, including collection of extensive clinical
data and biospecimens and successful outpatient follow-up. Moreover, our group pioneered the identification of
molecular phenotypes in ARDS and the use of metagenomic sequencing in pneumonia and sepsis, as evidence
of our relevant content expertise. Thus, we are well-prepared to contribute to the APS Consortium as a Clinical
Center.
 This application proposes a Consortium-wide study (Aim 1) that seeks to determine whether previously
observed latent molecular phenotypes of ARDS are present in critically ill patients across syndromic diagnostic
criteria for ARDS, pneumonia and sepsis, and whether these molecular phenotypes have consistent prognostic
value across syndromic diagnostic criteria. This application also proposes a Clinical Center-specific study (Aim
2) that seeks to determine whether integration of metagenomic data capturing both host and microbe enhances
mechanistic understanding and prognostic utility of ARDS, pneumonia, and sepsis molecular phenotypes.
Completion of these aims will lay the groundwork for a new taxonomy of critical illness, moving critical care
towards a precision medicine paradigm in which we can better match novel therapies with distinct clinical and
biological phenotypes, with the ultimate goal of improving outcomes for our patients."

Coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) and its carrier protein von Willebrand factor (VWF) play an essential role in blood
coagulation. We have led genome-wide association studies that successfully identified loci contributing to plasma
FVIII and VWF levels. Many of the identified genetic determinants affect both FVIII and VWF, while some loci
affect only FVIII or only VWF. We performed Mendelian randomization (MR) and found associations of
genetically determined FVIII and VWF levels with several arterial and venous thrombotic diseases. Despite these
advances, knowledge gaps remain in understanding the genetics of FVIII and VWF levels, especially in
understudied populations such as Hispanics. More complex regulatory mechanisms such as epistasis and
epigenetics remain uncharacterized. Finally, because many of the identified loci are shared between FVIII and
VWF, it has been difficult to determine the extent to which they play an independent or coordinated role in the
pathology of thrombotic disease.
The overall goals of the renewal of R01 HL139553 are to generate new biological knowledge about the genetic
and epigenetic regulation of FVIII and VWF in multi-ancestry populations and gain a better understanding of how
these hemostatic factors play a role in the development of thrombotic diseases. In Aim 1, we will identify new
genomic loci and improve fine-mapping of existing loci by measuring FVIII and VWF in plasma from 14,000
Hispanics with whole genome sequence data from the Hispanic Community Health Study / Study of Latinos and
combining it with existing multi-ancestry data from CHARGE and TOPMed. We will also evaluate epistatic effects
with the ABO blood group. In Aim 2, we will perform an epigenome-wide association study to examine the
association of FVIII and VWF levels with blood methylation levels at CpG sites across the genome and identify
genetic variants associated with these CpG sites. We will characterize the function of known and newly identified
loci from Aims 1 and 2 using in vitro and in vivo models. In Aim 3, we will use the genetic variants regulating
FVIII and VWF identified in Aims 1 and 2 as genetic instruments in MR analyses to assess whether FVIII and/or
VWF levels are causally related to the risk of several arterial and venous thrombotic diseases. The expected
outcomes are to have identified and validated novel genetic and epigenetic determinants of FVIII and VWF
levels, and to have elucidated the independent or coordinated effects of FVIII and VWF in thrombotic diseases.
These results are anticipated to have an important positive impact because they will provide evidence of the
relative importance of coagulation (i.e., via FVIII) or platelets (i.e., via VWF) in different thrombotic diseases,
thereby informing the targeted use of existing and novel therapies."

Structural racism, the ways in which societies foster discrimination through mutually reinforcing inequitable
systems, has emerged as an important social risk factor and contributor to poor health outcomes for ethnic
minorities (Egede 2020, Bailey 2017, Paradies 2015). An important component of structural racism that has
been inadequately studied is historic redlining. Historic redlining refers to the previously legal practice
(initiated in 1934 by the Federal Housing Administration) of systematically denying credit access and insurance
for borrowers in neighborhoods that were economically disadvantaged and that were inhabited by primarily
racial minority groups (Richardson 2020, Rothstein 2017). While explicit redlining is now prohibited under the
Fair Housing Act of 1968, the residual effects of residential redlining ensures that the same areas with
exposure to historic structural racism are to this day disproportionately inhabited by residents that are unduly
subject to worse social risk factors (defined across: Housing Instability; Food Insecurity; Transport Needs;
Economic Needs; and Safety), lower human capital (defined as the totality of individuals’ knowledge and
skills), and lower health care resources (defined as the medical resource capabilities of areas which enable
them to handle broad and complex medical events/cases) (Brillioux 2017, Bailey 2021, Hidalgo 2021); and that
redlining may present an important link between historic structural racism and present day disparities in health
outcomes (defined across: mortality, health care cost, health care utilization) (Egede 2020).
 The goal of this project is to inform our understanding of the pathways between structural racism
(defined as historic redlining), social risk factors, human capital, health care resources and health outcomes;
and to evaluate policies that can help reduce the impact of structural racism on health disparities. The present
study will accomplish this objective by using recently developed causal and interpretable machine learning
methods, structural equation modelling, counterfactual analysis, along with stakeholder engagement, to
address four aims: 1) Examine the relationship between regional exposure to structural racism (defined as:
historic redlining) and present-day social risk factors, human capital, and health care resources. 2) Examine
the direct and indirect effects of regional exposure to structural racism on health outcomes via social risk,
human capital, and healthcare resources. 3) Assess policy levers of federal, state, and regional governments
that can be used to reduce area vulnerabilities to historic structural racism, and that can reduce present-day
health outcomes disparities. 4) Engage a diverse set of key stakeholders to identify and prioritize strategies for
mitigating social risk, building human capital, and improving health care resources and outcomes for regions
exposed to structural racism through historical redlining. The study is innovative in: (i) its examination of the
linkages between structural racism and health outcomes, (ii) in its measurement of health care resources, and
(iii) in its emphasis on identifying policy channels for reducing the perpetual impact of structural racism."

Acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) are a genetically heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic disorders
characterized by accumulation of immature non-lymphoid marrow progenitors. While there have been notable
therapeutic advances over the past 5 years, many AML subtypes continue to have case fatality rates of >50%.
Despite the introduction of a number of targeted therapies, conventional cytotoxic drugs – alone or in
combination with the targeted agents – remain the mainstay of AML therapy. Among the conventional cytotoxic
drugs used to treat AML, several act by increasing unique types of DNA lesions known as DNA-protein
crosslinks (DPCs). In particular, topoisomerase poisons increase the number of DPCs containing TOP2
(daunorubicin, mitoxantrone, etoposide) or TOP1 (topotecan) covalently bound to DNA. In addition, the
hypomethylating agents decitabine and azacitidine increase the number of DPCs containing DNA
methyltransferases covalently bound to DNA. The mechanisms involved in DPC repair are at present
incompletely understood. To facilitate the further development of topotecan and other TOP1 poisons, as well
contribute to the study of TOP1-containing DPCs, we have generated an antibody that specifically recognizes
TOP1-DNA covalent complexes (TOP1ccs). Using this antibody, we have shown that the nuclear
metalloproteinase SPARTAN and the serine protease FAM111A, acting upstream of the phosphodiesterase
TDP1, play important roles in the repair of TOP1ccs in some tissues. Importantly, loss of SPARTAN, FAM111A
or TDP1 leads to accumulation of TOP1ccs in the absence of drug treatment as well as enhanced sensitivity to
the prototypic TOP1 poison camptothecin. More recently, we have also observed that a variety of malignant
myeloid cells, including AML cell lines and primary AML specimens, contain readily detectable TOP1ccs in the
absence of drug treatment and are slow to repair TOP1ccs upon exposure to the TOP1 poison topotecan. In
contrast, the vast majority of tissues, including normal and malignant lymphoid cells as well as normal marrow,
contain very few TOP1ccs in the absence of drug treatment. These results lead to the hypothesis that many
myeloid neoplasms have previously unsuspected defects in TOP1cc repair that might affect their
therapeutic sensitivity. To test this hypothesis, we now propose to define the biochemical basis for the
constitutive increase in TOP1ccs in myeloid neoplasms (Aim 1), examine the impact of low TOP1cc repair on
leukemia cell sensitivity to agents that stabilize DPCs (Aim 2), and assess the relationship between TOP1cc
levels (constitutive and drug-induced) and clinical response of myeloid neoplasms to a topotecan-containing
regimen currently undergoing NCI-sponsored phase II clinical testing in high risk AML (Aim 3). Collectively,
these studies will provide important new insight into a previously unsuspected DPC repair defect in myeloid
malignancies and begin to determine whether this repair defect has therapeutic implications that can be used
to guide improvements in AML therapy."

These proteins function either as canonical E3 ubiquitin ligases, deubiquitinases or as ubiquitin ligases that defy the catalytic mechanism of canonical ubiquitination. To explore additional effectors involved in co-opting the host ubiquitin network, we have created mutants that lack a specific set or each of the known effectors involved in ubiquitin signaling. Using biotin ligase-mediated proximity labeling, we have identified additional Dot/Icm substrates capable of catalyzing ubiquitination. We have also obtained evidence for the existence of Legionella proteins that directly modify ubiquitin. The goal of this project is to determine the function of these proteins, their catalytic mechanism and their cooperation with host ubiquitination components by biochemical and structural analyses. We will also study the regulation of their activity by factors from the bacterium and determine how such activity contributes to the biogenesis of the phagosome supportive of intracellular bacterial replication. Finally, we will design experiments to address the issue of the potential functional redundancy among Dot/Icm effectors (with or without E3 ubiquitin ligase activity) in the recruitment of Sec22b to the bacterial phagosome. Results from these experiments will reveal not only novel mechanisms of host function exploitation by intracellular pathogens, but also insights into the regulation of host ubiquitination pathways, both of which have the potential to be capitalized to develop novel methods for diagnosis and treatment of diseases."
10845310,"This proposal explores the role of a pulmonary osteoclast-like cell (POLC) in silicosis. We first discovered POLCs
while studying pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis (PAM), a rare, autosomal recessive disorder caused by
mutations in the epithelial sodium phosphate co-transporter, Npt2b. Phosphate accumulates in the alveolar lining
fluid and complexes with calcium to form spherical hydroxyapatite microliths containing bone matrix proteins and
surfactant components. Contact of microliths with tissue resident alveolar macrophages (TR-AM) and recruited
monocytes (Mo-AM) induces osteoclastic transformation in the Npt2b-/- mouse, with expression of the full
repertoire of osteoclast signature gene and protein expression in multinucleated giant cells (MNGC) including
tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), cathepsin K (CTSK), calcitonin receptor (CALCR) and the proton
pump, ATP6V0D2. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of human PAM lung also confirmed a robust
osteoclast signature in AM, and IHC confirmed the presence of TRAP and CTSK positive MNGC. Like humans,
Npt2b-/- animals develop modest pulmonary fibrosis and a marked restrictive physiologic defect. We found that
microliths induce alveolar expression of the requisite osteoclastogenic cytokines for POLC differentiation (i.e. M-
CSF, RANKL) and expression of hydrochloric acid and CTSK that both dissolve stones and damage tissues. We
were surprised to find that the Npt2b-/- mice also develop pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, which has not been
reported in PAM, but is known to be associated with another particulate exposure syndrome, silicoproteinosis.
This led us to consider that osteoclastic transformation of TR-AM and Mo-AM is a stereotypic response to inhaled
particles, resulting in the concomitant loss of AM surfactant catabolic and host defense functions (in the form of
susceptibility to Tb). Indeed, snRNAseq, rtPCR measures of gene expression and IHC assessments revealed
that silica challenge is also associated with RANKL-dependent osteoclastic transformation of BAL and
parenchymal cells, and TRAP, CTSK and hydrochloric acid production, culminating in destructive remodeling
and pulmonary fibrosis, and associated with a decrease in proteins required for lipid metabolism. Anti- RANKL
treatment of mice attenuates the silicoproteinosis, POLC formation, fibrosis and the restrictive physiologic defect
that occurs in silica-challenged mice. The differential tissue responses to dissolvable vs. persistent particulates
forms the basis for our hypothesis that persistent acid and matrix degrading enzymes produced by POLC may
be primary drivers of particulate-induced fibrosis. To test this hypothesis in three aims, we will determine; 1) Cell
lineages and alveolar factors that give rise to POLC; 2) The role of osteoclastic functions and products in silica-
induced fibrosis; and 3) The role of POLC in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, in vivo. This proposal directly
addresses mechanisms relevant to the alarming rise in the prevalence of progressive massive fibrosis in black
lung claimants, and successful completion of the aims will provide preclinical evidence supporting anti-
osteoclastic strategies such as bisphosphonates and anti-RANKL in exposed subjects."
10812484,"ABSTRACT
While the ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria provides the energy for the synthesis of
proteins, nucleic acids and other macromolecules, this process generates as a by-product reactive oxygen
species that present a unique challenge for the circular mitochondrial genome. Notably, the accumulation of
oxidative DNA damage in mitochondrial DNA inhibits the transcription of key electron transport proteins encoded
by the mitochondrial genome disrupting electron transport leading to a further increase in reactive oxygen
species. In addition to the reactive oxygen species generated within mitochondria, some environmental DNA
damaging agents preferentially cause damage in the mitochondrial genome compared with the nuclear genome.
Interestingly, although the oxidized base 8-oxoguanine is repaired, oxidative DNA damage also induces
degradation of the mitochondrial genome. Since there are multiple copies of the mitochondrial genome per
organelle, it has been suggested that the removal of damaged genomes by degradation serves to prevent
mutations. For oxidative DNA damage, it is not known what lesion(s) triggers genome degradation and whether
this reduces mutations. In Specific Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that the MUTYH DNA glycosylase protects
the mitochondrial genome from mutation by stably binding to genomes with the 8-oxoG:adenine mispairs or the
8-oxoG:abasic site repair intermediate and targeting them for degradation using unique tools and reagents
developed by the PI and co-I. The proposed studies will elucidate the mechanisms that engage with oxidative
DNA damage in mitochondria to either repair the damage or target the damaged genome for degradation.
Specific Aim 2 builds upon a novel interaction identified between the mitochondrial DNA ligase, DNA ligase
IIIa (LigIIIa) , and NDUFAB1, an accessory subunit of complex I of the electron transport chain that provides
possible explanation as to why the LigIIIa inhibitor rapidly induces production of mitochondrial superoxide. We
will characterize the interaction between mitochondrial LigIIIa and complex I to determine whether LigIIIa has a
non-canonical role in complex I function, thereby linking mitochondrial DNA metabolism with oxidative
phosphorylation. Cancer and non-malignant cells respond very differently to the dysfunction caused by inhibition
of mitochondrial LigIIIa with cancer cells activating an inflammatory cell death pathway whereas non-malignant
cells activate mitophagy and pro-inflammatory cell stress pathways. In Specific Aim 3, we will delineate the
mechanisms and regulation of the cellular pathways that respond to mitochondrial dysfunction induced by
inhibition of mitochondrial LigIIIa in cancer and non-malignant cells. Alterations in mitochondrial function that are
usually associated with increased oxidative stress have been identified as the causative factor in certain human
metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases and implicated in inflammation, cancer and ageing. Thus, our
proposed studies will provide fundamental insights as to how mitochondria maintain their genome and suggest
how mitochondrial dysfunction can be mitigated or exploited to improve human health."
10806180,"Traumatic brain injury has many sequelae resulting from the initial injury that exacerbate neural
degeneration and functional deficits, which may emerge over long times following the initial
injury. While many studies have examined secondary neuronal loss in the penumbra of the
injury site that occurs due to the induction of inflammatory cytokines and an altered trophic
environment, the impact of these changes in the injured tissue on afferent axons that project to
the injury site from distal locations has not been investigated. In particular, basal forebrain
cholinergic neurons (BFCN) project throughout the cortex and hippocampus, and these neurons
are critical for numerous cognitive functions. These neurons express all the neurotrophin
receptors, the Trk family (TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC) which promote neuronal survival and axonal
growth, as well as p75NTR, which can promote neuronal death and axon degeneration.
Therefore, the consequence of altered levels of trophic factors in the target regions of these
neurons may critically impact the integrity of their axonal projections and ultimately have
negative consequences for the cognitive functions supported by these neurons. Using the fluid
percussion injury (FPI) model to induce moderate TBI in mice, we will investigate the immediate
and long-term consequences of cortical injury on the afferent basal forebrain neurons. Using
compartment culture strategies, we will investigate mechanisms of axonal signaling that mediate
retrograde degenerative responses. Understanding the full scope of damage that occurs as a
consequence of TBI is critical to developing therapeutic strategies to limit the negative
consequences of the injury."

There is a fundamental gap in understanding the extent to which the school environment contributes to
respiratory virus exposure, and less is known about potential environmental interventions to reduce exposure.
Our long-term goal is to create healthy indoor school environments for children. The overall objective of this
application is to identify modifiable factors of respiratory virus exposure in elementary schools in order to
reduce asthma morbidity. We will combine novel approaches to quantify and characterize the respiratory
virome in schools by leveraging the robust infrastructure of the School Inner-City Asthma Intervention Study
(SICAS-2, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02291302), a randomized controlled trial conducted by our group of a
placebo-controlled classroom high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) cleaner intervention. We will test our
central hypothesis that schools are a source of high respiratory virus exposure that affects asthma morbidity
through the following specific aims: (1) To compare respiratory virus exposure in schools as compared to
homes by using a hybrid capture panel to recover genomes of detected respiratory viruses; (2) To identify
factors predicting respiratory virus exposure in schools including the efficacy of portable HEPA cleaners in
reducing classroom respiratory virus exposure; (3) To determine the association between the classroom
respiratory virome and asthma symptoms in elementary school children. The approach is innovative, because
we are simultaneously interrogating all major human respiratory viruses in the school environment. The
proposed research is significant, because it will identify the magnitude of exposure to respiratory viruses in
schools and potential environmental factors that can serve as future targets of intervention. If the HEPA
intervention can reduce respiratory virus exposure, it is an immediately actionable and practical intervention to
create safer indoor environments for elementary school children. Results from this proposal may be
generalizable to other public indoor settings."
10873835,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pathological hypertrophy can progress to failing heart. During the transition, fatty acid utilization is decreased,
while utilization of other substrates, such as ketone body, is increased. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that
increased myocardial ketone body utilization is an adaptive response against cardiac pathology. Furthermore,
although ketoacidosis is life-threatening, short-term administration of exogenous ketone body enhances
myocardial oxygen consumption with increases in both ketone body oxidation and overall ATP production in
the heart. This intervention improves cardiac function and remodeling in humans and mice with heart failure
(HF). Although ketone body serves as not only a fuel source but a modulator of lysine acetylation, the effect of
ketone body-mediated acetylation against hypertrophy and HF remains poorly understood. Elucidating the
molecular mechanisms of ketone body action beyond fueling, which mediates anti-hypertrophic and pro-
energetic effects without provoking detrimental effects, is the most important issue in establishing ketone body
as a therapeutic option for HF. We recently found that lysine acetyltransferase 6A (KAT6A) is acetylated in the
heart by a low-carbohydrate (LC) diet-mediated increase in ketone body, which is negatively associated with
hypertrophy and HF after pressure overload. Thus, we here ask whether acetylation of KAT6A is critically
involved in ketone body action against cardiac pathology. Our study provided evidence that acetylation of
KAT6A inhibits phenylephrine-induced hypertrophy and improves energy homeostasis in cardiomyocytes in
vitro. However, it remains unknown how KAT6A acetylation regulates cardiac morphology and function. Based
on these exciting observations we propose a novel role of KAT6A acetylation in pathological hypertrophy and
its transition to HF. Together with the surprising findings from our studies using proteomics and genomics
analyses, we hypothesize that ketone body promotes acetylation of KAT6A, which stimulates the AMPK
signaling in the heart to suppress protein synthesis and maintain energy homeostasis, thereby inhibiting
pathological hypertrophy and a transition to HF. To address this hypothesis, we will conduct the following
experiments. In Aim 1, we will determine the significance of KAT6A acetylation in pressure overload-induced
hypertrophy and HF in vivo by using newly generated KAT6A acetylation-resistant knock-in mice and an AAV-
KAT6A acetylation-mimicking mutant. In Aim 2, we will demonstrate the critical involvement of AMPK in KAT6A
action by pharmacologically and genetically inhibiting AMPK. We will further elucidate the mechanism by which
AMPK is activated by KAT6A by using molecular signaling and biological assays. The long-term goal of this
project is to identify the therapeutic targets to specifically modulate the ketone body-KAT6A-AMPK pathway
relevant to the strategies for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiac hypertrophy and HF."
10851874,"Glaucoma is a very common age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized by the death of the retinal
ganglion cells. Despite its prevalence, there are no neuroprotective treatments for glaucoma. The only current
treatment is lowering intraocular pressure which unfortunately does not prevent or restore vision loss in many
patients. Due to extensive research in both glaucoma patients and animal models of glaucoma, much is known
about glaucomatous neurodegeneration, both at the physiological and molecular levels. However, despite this,
we still lack a molecular understanding of the early pathological events that injure RGCs as a result of ocular
hypertension. Microglia cells are a major component of the neuroinflammatory response in neurodegenerative
diseases and after injury to the central nervous system. In fact, microglia cell response is thought to play key
roles in many neurodegenerative diseases, including, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Huntingtin
disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Work in other systems has shown that microglia can act be both
protective and detrimental in the disease process, and possibly these two actions could take place sequentially
in the same disease. Recent studies using modern sequencing technology has shown that microglia exist in
different molecular states which correspond to their role in disease. A major, well-supported hypothesis in
glaucoma research is that microglial cells are critical for maintaining retinal ganglion cell viability after a
glaucomatous insult. However, the importance of microglia in an ocular hypertensive model of glaucoma has not
been critically tested. In this application we propose to test the hypothesis that different activated states of
microglia play distinct roles in glaucoma dependent upon stage of disease. Specifically, in two ocular
hypertensive glaucoma mouse models, we will: (1) Determine if the role of microglia activation varies with
disease stage, (2) define and test the importance of different molecular states, and (3) determine the role of
microglial derived neurotoxic cytokines. Overall, this proposal we will define novel mechanisms by which
microglia states modulate glaucoma onset and progression leading to novel candidates for therapeutic
evaluation."

Initiation of innate immune responses depends on cognate interaction between germline-encoded pattern
recognition receptors and their ligands (expressed by microbes). Following recognition, the receptors initiate
activation of downstream signal transduction pathways that often involve recruitment of downstream adapters
and kinases. The Toll-like receptor family of PRRs, which are the subject of current investigation, are expressed
both on the plasma membrane and in the endosomes. Several recent studies have demonstrated that
endocytosis of the plasma membrane TLRs (especially TLR4) plays a critical role in regulating both quality and
magnitude of inflammatory responses in a responding macrophage. Other studies have demonstrated that TLR
signaling enhances phagocytosis of microbial cargo but not of apoptotic cell cargo suggesting a degree of
specificity that is not understood. In addition, although endocytosis of TLR4 and the events following endocytosis
of TLR4 that influence signal transduction are very well studied, it is not entirely clear if and how endocytosis
influences signaling downstream of other plasma membrane and endosomal TLRs. In our studies, we find that
a protein called Vps33B regulates handling of the phagocytic and endocytic cargo following pattern recognition
receptor activation. More importantly, Vps33B directly influences the outcome of signaling downstream of TLRs
in mice and Toll- and IMD pathways in Drosophila. Mutations in the genes VPS33B and VPS16B are linked to a
rare human disease called ARC (Arthrogryposis-renal dysfunction-cholestasis) syndrome. Both of these ARC
genes encode paralogs of HOPS complex subunits suggesting a role in membrane fusions but how perturbation
of function of these proteins results in a diverse spectrum of disease symptoms in ARC patients is not entirely
clear. It has however been documented that ARC patients suffer from sepsis and recurrent bacterial infections
and we were therefore investigated the role of these proteins in influencing immune responses. We find that in
the absence of VPS33B, Drosophila respond vigorously to microbial insult. Exaggerated immune responses are
generated in response to live or dead bacteria and purified ligands of the Toll and IMD pathway results in death
of Vps33B mutant, but not wild-type flies. This function of Vps33B is conserved in vertebrates and we find that
mouse macrophages lacking Vps33B secrete very high quantities of inflammatory cytokines, when stimulated
by either plasma membrane or endosomal TLR ligands. We therefore hypothesize that activation of pattern
recognition receptors and specifically TLRs leads to formation of specialized endosomes that depend on Vps33B
for lysosomal fusion. Lack of Vps33B is likely to affect several aspects of innate and adaptive immunity and to
test this hypothesis, we propose to 1. Define the molecular events that regulate Vps33B function in endosomal
maturation, 2. Define the role of Vps33B-regulated TLR trafficking and signaling 3. Investigate the role of Vps33B
in regulating cargo handling by DCs and 4. Investigate the role of Vps33B in regulating antigen presentation and
adaptive immunity."

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic underlines both our susceptibility to and the toll of a global pathogen outbreak.
Phylogenetic analysis of viral genomes provides key insight into disease pathophysiology, spread and po-
tential control. However, if these methods are to be used in a viral control strategy they must reliably account for
uncertainty and be able to perform inference on 1,000s of genomes in actionable time. Scaling Bayesian phylogenet-
ics to meet this need is a grand challenge that is unlikely to be met by optimizing existing algorithms.
 We will meet this challenge with a radically new approach: Bayesian variational inference for phylogenet-
ics (VIP) using ﬂexible distributions on phylogenetic trees that are ﬁt using gradient-based methods analogous
to how one efﬁciently trains massive neural networks. By taking a variational approach we will also be able
to integrate phylogenetic analysis into very powerful open-source modeling frameworks such as TensorFlow
and PyTorch. This will open up new classes of models, such as neural network models, to integrate data such
as sampling location and migration patterns with phylogenetic inference. These ﬂexible models will inform
strategies for viral control.
 In Aim 1 we will develop the theory necessary for scalable and reliable VIP, including subtree marginal-
ization, local gradient updates needed for online algorithms, convergence diagnostics, and parameter support
estimates. We will implement these algorithms in our C++ foundation library for VIP. In Aim 2 we will
develop a ﬂexible TensorFlow-based modeling platform for phylogenetics, enabling a whole new realm of
phylogenetic models based on neural networks to learn phylodynamic heterogeneity with minimal program-
ming effort. We will provide efﬁcient gradients to this implementation via our C++ library. In Aim 3 we will
use the fact that VIP posteriors are durable and extensible descriptions of the full data posterior to enable
dynamic online computation of variational posteriors, including divide-and-conquer Bayesian phylogenetics.
This work will enable a cloud-based viral phylogenetics solution to rapidly update our current estimate of the
posterior distribution when new data arrive or the model is modiﬁed.

Students relate to science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) subjects when they are linked to real-
life experiences. School lunch can be that link. The National School Lunch Program (NSLP), initially conceived
as a poverty reduction program, has the potential to be so much more. Meals served through the NSLP make
up a large portion of the diets of ~30 million students. Research shows that school meals are the healthiest
meals of the day for many children in the United States. Yet, the NSLP and academics have never been
integrated. Creating Resources Uplifting Nutrition, Culture, and Health at Lunch (CRUNCH Lunch)
makes this connection by linking STEM with the real-world and relatable experience of school lunch. CRUNCH
Lunch will be evaluated in a diverse and urban elementary school-aged population (~15,840 students). The
long-term goal of the proposed study is to bring STEM to students in a relatable and culturally relevant way
to: increase early interest in STEM, improve food literacy, and increase school lunch consumption. It is known
that evidence-based nutrition education enables elementary school students to improve food literacy, which
leads to improved health outcomes. It is also known that science education that is relatable and culturally
relevant increases interest in STEM. Creating STEM interest among young children increases the likelihood of
students maintaining their interest as they get older, thus potentially increasing the pipeline of students
entering STEM careers. What is not known is whether providing professional development to elementary
school teachers to deliver connect STEM learning to required science units, and providing teachers access to
curricular resources to integrate school lunch with STEM will improve: students’ interest in STEM, food literacy,
and consumption of school lunch.
The specific aims are, Aim 1: Create CRUNCH Lunch Teacher Workshops. These professional
development workshops (delivered in person or via video conferencing) empower teachers to combine inquiry-
based STEM education with evidence-based nutrition education, to improve their attitudes and confidence in
STEM and in connecting education to school lunch. Aim 2: Create a CRUNCH Lunch Resource Hub (web-
based). This robust and comprehensive professional development Resource Hub provides teachers with
ongoing support to apply what they learned in the workshops (Aim 1) to increase students’ STEM and food-
related attitudes, STEM and food literacy, and students’ consumption of school lunch. The proposed project
is innovative because it will be the first to systematically link the NSLP to STEM academics. At the
completion of the proposed study, we will measure (i) whether students have increased interest in STEM,
improved food and STEM literacy, and increased consumption of school meals; and, (ii) whether teachers have
improved attitudes and confidence in connecting STEM to school lunch."

Over the past twenty years our knowledge of astrocytes has undergone a renaissance highlighted by the
identification of dynamic physiological activities, key roles in circuit function, and diverse molecular properties.
Central to the physiological activities of every cell are transcription factors (TFs), yet roles for TFs in mature
astrocyte function and associated circuits in the brain have remained relatively undefined. Our molecular
studies on astrocyte diversity highlighted the expression of developmental TFs in mature astrocytes, in the
adult brain. Among these TFs are members of the Nuclear Factor I (NFI)- and Sox- family, which play essential
roles in early astrocyte development and continue to be expressed in a vast majority of mature astrocytes
throughout the adult brain. Despite exhibiting universal expression in astrocytes across all regions, we found
that NFIA and Sox9 exhibit region specific roles in mature astrocytes, where hippocampal astrocytes require
NFIA to maintain their functional integrity, while olfactory bulb astrocytes require Sox9.
 Our finding that astrocytes exhibit region specific transcriptional dependencies, where at given TF is
absolutely essential for function in one region, but is dispensable in other regions, serves as the foundational
observation for this R35 application. We will use other NFI- and Sox- family TF members that are universally
expressed in astrocytes to map region-specific transcriptional dependencies across the developing, adult, and
aging brain. Our analysis will be comprehensive, spanning core astrocyte functions, interactions with neurons,
and circuit-level activities. We posit that these region-specific transcriptional dependencies for astrocyte
function will provide an entry point for understanding how astrocyte diversity is encoded. Therefore, we will use
a host of transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic approaches to uncover how these regional-specific TF
functions are conferred, while functionalizing roles for key downstream target genes. Finally, astrocyte
dysfunction is associated with a host of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s Disease. Here, we
will apply our findings and new mouse models to AD, seeking to uncover how these core features of astrocyte
TF function contribute to AD disease pathogenesis."

 This integrated research and training plan will prepare Dr. Thompson, a research assistant professor and
licensed clinical neuropsychologist, to become an independent PI. Dr. Thompson’s long-term goal is to become
an expert in the validation and application of novel AD screening methods within healthcare settings,
particularly those serving racial/ethnic groups with disparities in rates of AD vs. AD diagnosis. Her short-term
goals for this K23 are to: (1) gain expertise in primary care-based recruitment, implementation science,
pragmatic measurement, and statistical methods for the rigorous development and validation of novel cognitive
protocols, (2) to test the hypothesis that combined use of remote (self-administered), app-based testing and
table-based screening in primary care clinics will be feasible, acceptable, and associated with AD biomarkers.
 The early detection of cognitive impairment is one of the most important challenges in AD research. Cost-
efficient and effective screening strategies for primary care will greatly enhance early diagnosis and treatment.
Cognitive assessment is non-invasive, scalable, and covered by most insurance. Cognitive screening is a
required part of the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit typically done by PCPs. However, current cognitive
screening tools are insensitive to subtle cognitive changes and have poor specificity in underrepresented
populations. Digital cognitive tools overcome many limitations of current paper-and-pencil based approaches.
 In this project, Dr. Thompson will partner with local primary care practices to enroll a diverse sample (25%
identifying as a racial/ethnic minority, Spanish or English speaking) of 100 older adults without prior dementia
diagnosis. Participants will complete phone screening and consent and do 5 days of brief NIH MobileToolbox
(MTB) assessments on a smartphone within one month of their annual PCP follow-up visit. Participants without
a compatible device or home internet receive a study-provided device. At their PCP follow-up visit, participants
will complete brief tablet-based and traditional paper-and-pencil-based screening measures. We will obtain
feedback from participants and PCPs on the use of the novel digital screening tools. Participants will complete
a brief visit to the Butler Memory and Aging Program to do a blood draw for AD plasma biomarker analysis.
 Under the guidance of a strong mentorship team of NIH-funded researchers, Dr. Thompson will achieve
four specific training goals: 1. Acquire experience and specialized training in primary care outreach and
recruitment, with a focus on practices that serve underrepresented populations. 2. Extend her knowledge in
implementation science, pragmatic measurement, and clinical research trial design. 3. Build advanced
knowledge and skills in quantitative and qualitative data analysis, including biostatistics, psychometric
evaluation, longitudinal data analysis, and clinical outcomes assessment. 4. Apply/actualize her skills from
goals 1-3 to build expertise in the rigorous development and multimodal validation of novel cognitive measures,
and develop a scalable primary care-based cognitive screening protocol."
10930808,"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
 The ability of brown adipose tissue (BAT) to expend energy through a process called adaptive
thermogenesis makes it an attractive target for intervention in obesity; however, the observation that BAT mass
diminishes in human obesity raises concerns about its ability to clinically impact body weight when fully activated.
Energy-storing white adipose tissue (WAT) can also adopt a “brown-like” thermogenic phenotype; however, there
are potent molecular brakes on thermogenic gene program in white adipocytes that help maintain its energy-
storing phenotype. Since WAT is present in far greater mass than BAT, activation of the thermogenic gene
program in white adipocytes may be a more viable strategy for intervention in obesity; however, the mechanisms
controlling the establishment and maintenance of the energy-burning vs. energy-storing adipocyte lineages
remain undefined.
 ZFP423, a member of the C2H2 family of zinc finger proteins, is a physiologically regulated transcription
factor that functions to maintain the energy-storing white adipocyte phenotype by suppressing the thermogenic
gene program characteristic of brown/beige fat cells. ZFP423 physically interacts with the brown adipocyte
determination factor, EBF2, in white adipocytes to prevent EBF2-dependent chromatin remodeling and PPARg
occupancy at key thermogenic genes.
 The experiments that I propose to conduct as part of my PhD training in the Duke University Medical
Scientist Training Program will utilize advanced approaches in biochemistry, molecular biology, and mouse
genetics. This work, conducted under the mentorship of Dr. Rana Gupta at the Duke Molecular Physiology
Institute, is designed to 1) address the hypothesis that the ability of ZFP423 to directly recruit the NuRD complex
to EBF2 is essential for its ability to suppress thermogenesis in white adipocytes (Aim1), and 2) test the
hypothesis that genetic disruption of the ZFP423-EBF complex in mice is sufficient to permit thermogenic WAT
remodeling and prevent the development of obesity and metabolic dysfunction. The overall goal of my proposed
research is to further define the critical protein-protein interactions leading to the suppression of the thermogenic
gene program by ZFP423 in white adipocytes. Successful completion of this work will highlight the importance
of transcriptional “brakes” on thermogenic gene expression in adipocytes and may suggest a strategy to unlock
the thermogenic capacity of WAT to promote weight loss and/or improve nutrient homeostasis."
10914902,"Rates of heavy drinking and Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) are increasing in women at an alarming pace. Such
drastic increases in drinking will have a significant negative impact on women’s health. Unfortunately, until
recently heavy drinking has been considered a male-oriented problem, and consequently research on alcohol-
related harms in women has been minimal. One specific aspect of women’s health that may be negatively
affected by alcohol is sleep. Numerous studies in men show that although alcohol has an initial sedative effect,
it leads to frequent awakenings and impaired rapid eye movement sleep in the second half of the night.
Preliminary evidence suggests that women experience similar impairment, and that they may be even more
sensitive to alcohol-disrupted sleep than men. Further, in the general population, women are at greater risk for
insomnia and sleep disturbances than men, in part because women’s sleep is sensitive to fluctuations in
ovarian hormones. Hormonal influences on sleep are especially pronounced in older women of late
reproductive age. However, the influence of sex and sex hormones on alcohol-disrupted sleep across the
reproductive lifespan in women is unknown. Here, we will determine the influence of sex, menstrual cycle
phase, and sex hormones on alcohol-disrupted sleep in adults across the reproductive age range for women.
Healthy women and men (age 21-45) will complete two pairs of experimental sessions in which they receive a
dose of alcohol (target BrAC = 100mg%, intravenous) or placebo (saline) one hour prior to eight hours of
polysomnographically-monitored sleep in the lab. Women will complete one alcohol-placebo session pair
during the mid-follicular phase of the menstrual cycle and one pair during the late luteal phase. Men will
complete two session pairs at matched intervals. Participants will also complete two 5-day at-home monitoring
periods of naturalistic sleep and alcohol consumption patterns during the mid-follicular and late luteal phases.
Sleep and alcohol use will be assessed with actigraphy, daily sleep and wake diaries, and alcohol wrist
sensors. We hypothesize that women will show greater disruption of sleep following alcohol than men and that
alcohol-disrupted sleep, measured in lab with polysomnography and at-home with actigraphy, will be more
pronounced in the late luteal phase compared to the mid-follicular phase. We also expect that estradiol will be
negatively associated with alcohol-disrupted sleep, whereas progesterone will be positively associated with
alcohol-disrupted sleep. This study will provide essential information regarding alcohol effects on sleep across
the reproductive age span in women, and critically, how these effects are moderated by sex, menstrual cycle,
and fluctuations in sex hormones. Findings will directly inform future interventions aimed at reducing alcohol
consumption and the negative impacts of alcohol on sleep in women. Given the wide-ranging impact of sleep
on other areas of function, including cognition, stress, and well-being, such interventions will have a substantial
positive impact on women’s health."

interventions to improve function — the goal of Precision Gerontology.
RC1 activities will focus on building capacity through community-based participatory research (CBPR) involving
collaborative, equitable partnerships; encouraging involvement of community assets; connecting, supporting,
and serving communities; engaging all stakeholders; and effectively disseminating findings. RC1 will support
Pepper scholars, developmental projects, pilot and exploratory studies, and external projects consistent with the
OAIC mission. RC1 will enhance research participation opportunities for Black, Indigenous and People of Color
(BIPoC) populations, highlighting equity, inclusion, and diversity. We propose to formalize new and strengthen
existing partnerships in community and individual settings by conducting educational, action-oriented meaningful
practice and inviting participation in programs and studies.
Finally, we will make our recruitment services (including protocol development and regulatory guidance)
accessible to investigators who have not yet received funding and/or collaborate with organizations who may
have little or no experience but have interest in conducting aging research."
10900732,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – Data Resource Core (RC2)
The overall goal of RC2 is to enhance scientific productivity of investigators and projects
supported by the UConn OAIC, and to external project investigators, by providing ready access
to knowledge, expertise, and services related to study design, data capture, database
management, data analysis, and measurement approaches. RC2 will support research relevant
to Precision Gerontology in 4 functional domains, consistent with the theme of the UConn OAIC,
and to independence of older persons. RC2 will offer individualized services as well as
organized didactic and interactive learning opportunities, and in conjunction with other OAIC
components will manage and provide access to a cross-study database with standardized
measures for generation of new studies. RC2 will provide data-related support to 3 Pilot Studies
in Year 1 as well as 2 Developmental Projects, including an RC2 Developmental Project
featuring single cell RNAseq genomic profiling of PBMCs from metformin-flu vaccine biomarker
data (in Year 1), and analyses linking biomarker data with physical function and frailty measures
from one of the OAIC-supported pilot studies (PESC3; in Year 2)."
10900737,"PESC ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
The Pilot and Exploratory Studies Core (PESC) will promote the development of novel ideas and approaches to
improving and sustaining independent function in older persons through Precision Gerontology. Using a rigorous
application and selection process developed to maximize the pipeline of investigators pursuing Precision
Gerontology, the PESC will select up to 3 pilot and exploratory studies (PES) each year of the award. Selection
criteria specified in the Request for Applications (RFA) will include the potential to lead to larger high-impact
projects, involvement of Pepper Cores, and responsiveness to the UConn Pepper Center focus on Precision
Gerontology. PESC-funded projects can include a range of study designs from basic bench and human subject
research to population science. The PESC seeks to fund three(PES) in Year 1 that each emphasize enhanced
understanding of heterogeneity with aging and/or improved targeting in aging. PES1, Apathy: An Early
Manifestation of Frailty and Disability in Older Adults with Depression?, will test the hypotheses that there will be
differences in functional performance and blood-based biomarkers between older depressed adults with and
without apathy. The results of this study will enhance understanding the pathophysiology underlying apathy and
may help identify treatment targets in older depressed adults. PES2, Multicomponent web-based behavioral
intervention to improve physical function and other health outcomes among African American older adults in the
COVID-19 era, will develop, implement, and evaluate a multicomponent, culturally-tailored educational
intervention to reengage and promote physical activity, adequate nutrition, and optimal mental health for African
American older adults. PES3, The Heterogeneity of Vulnerabilities in Aging Cohort (HVAC): A new resource for
early biomarker discovery and validation, seeks to provide junior faculty with: (1) experience in preparing an IRB
protocol, recruiting human subjects, and assessing frailty; and (2) the opportunity to generate data that can be
used to develop a platform for biomarker discovery and for future NIH grant applications. These goals will be
accomplished using a cohort of well-defined geriatric clinical phenotypes that are associated with particular types
of vulnerability or frailty. Metrics of success for each PES will include generation of preliminary data to support
external NIH grant applications and dissemination of knowledge via presentations and manuscripts. Overall
success of the PESC Core will be assessed in terms of responsiveness to the RFA and number of peer-reviewed
manuscripts, submitted applications, and external funding generated from PESC-funded studies."
10900740,"PROJECT SUMMARY REC
The goal of the UConn OAIC Research Education Component (REC) is to create a new generation of
investigators in aging with exposure to multidisciplinary translational science and expertise in Precision
Gerontology, an area of special emphasis for this proposal. Our goals will be accomplished through 4 aims:
Aim 1: Identify and promote careers of individuals poised to conduct Precision Gerontology research by
providing direct OAIC and matching institutional support together with “in kind” services for 5 Pepper Scholars,
with additional efforts to attract junior investigators and support Emerging Scholars; Aim 2: Provide structured
career development for skills that address the broad range of Precision Gerontology research undertaken at
the OAIC (basic, clinical, health services, and epidemiology) through a broad array of didactic and experiential
offerings, emphasizing multidisciplinary approaches to translation between the bench, bedside and the
community; Aim 3: Provide Coordination and Management Services within the REC and across OAIC Cores
involving access to experienced mentors, feedback, career guidance, direct financial per commitments in
letters from UConn School of Medicine, UConn VP for Research and Jackson Lab plus opportunities to
collaborate with other cores and units within and outside the institution for OAIC-related themes.
 The REC will be led by Dr. David Steffens, MD, MHS, Professor and Chair of Psychiatry at UConn Health
who will be assisted by Dr. George Kuchel, MD (REC co-leader; OAIC PI). Both are accomplished mentors,
leaders and leaders in aging research. At the same time, they offer highly complementary backgrounds and
skillsets, thus facilitating the leadership and scientific direction of a REC with a deep commitment to
multidisciplinary team science and translation.
 For Year 1, we propose to recruit three highly promising junior faculty as Pepper Scholars. In the application
we describe the wide pool of talent from which we can recruit Pepper Scholars across UConn Health, UConn
Storrs and in the Schools of Nursing, Social Work and Pharmacy. We will aim to recruit a diverse group of
young researchers whose collective expertise and interests reflect the broad goals and ambitions of this
application. The REC will support a total three scholars per year in each of the five years of the project; should
a Scholar graduate from the REC, another will be recruited as a new replacement."
10894865,"Project Summary/Abstract
Despite the increasing burden of rheumatic diseases on the US population, there is a national shortage of
rheumatology investigators in major medical centers working to find the causes and cures of these debilitating
disorders. The Rheumatology Training Program at the University of Washington (UW) is designed to help
address this important shortfall and has a long-standing track record of success. The UW attracts highly
qualified trainees both from within the residency program and nationally that are motivated to help fill this
urgent need. The goal of our combined adult and pediatric training program that takes advantage of our unique
medical and scientific environment is to provide MD and PhD postdoctoral fellows high quality basic or clinical
science training in rheumatic disease and to equip them to become independent academic researchers. We
have maintained the 3 pathways -basic, clinical and translational to accommodate the needs, interests and
skills of both the applicant pool and mentors in the program. We have improved our training program during the
last funding period by: 1) fostering cross-talk between these pathways and between adult and pediatric
mentors and trainees; 2) recruiting new faculty to both adult and pediatric rheumatology divisions 3) optimizing
our pool of outstanding established mentors and recruiting new mentors and co-mentors to facilitate training; 4)
“promoting” our mentors-in-training to mentors in the program; and 5) increasing the number of ACGME
fellowship positions 6) instituting plans to further increase diversity of trainees.
 The proposed training requests 4 postdoctoral fellowship positions. Based on the need to attract
medical students to the exciting field of rheumatology and success in this current cycle, we also request
continuing 2 annual short-term summer electives for medical students. The fellowship program is open to MDs
who have completed a clinical year in Rheumatology and PhDs who have completed their accredited training.
MDs in the clinical research pathway enter the Masters or Certificate Program in epidemiology or public health
at the UW School of Public Health. Our typical trainee completes 2-3 years of basic / clinical science training
during which time all trainees are expected to publish their work and submit a fellowship(s) grant. A well-
designed core curriculum, formal mentoring program and individualized oversight assists trainees with career
and scientific guidance, and provides trainees with essential skills in grant writing and other assets required for
long-term success. Finally, a committee comprising UW internal and external experts assist the joint Program
Directors in programmatic governance, and to ensure the programmatic benchmarks and expectations are
achieved."
10875286,"The World Health Organization reports that nearly a half billion people suffer from a disabling hearing loss
worldwide. Hearing loss is typically measured in the standard audiometric frequency range, 250 to 8,000 Hz.
However, the young, healthy human frequency range of hearing extends to about 20,000 Hz. Extended high-
frequency hearing loss (>8,000 Hz) is rarely assessed in the clinic but is a widespread, natural, age-related
condition that begins as early as young adulthood. It is unknown to what extent extended high-frequency
hearing loss affects daily functioning. This proposal assesses the ecological value of extended high-frequency
hearing for speech perception and spatial awareness in realistic settings, which will include spatially separated
talkers having different head orientations in reverberant conditions. There are three specific aims. Aim 1 will
generate a high-fidelity multi-directional anechoic speech database with a representative cohort of adult native
speakers of American English. This database is designed to be used for speech perception experiments and
will be made publicly available. Speech spectral energy across the full range of human hearing will be
examined, as well as the nature of speech radiation toward different directions around the talkers. Aim 2 will
test the effect of simulated loss of extended high frequencies on speech perception and spatial awareness for
listeners with normal hearing out to 16 kHz. These experiments are based on our recent observation that
extended high frequencies in speech provide a benefit for speech-in-speech recognition. We will determine the
magnitude of this benefit in realistic settings and the factors responsible for it. Aim 3 will test the effect of
natural loss of extended high frequencies on speech perception and spatial awareness. Forms of natural loss
that will be studied include hearing loss at extended high frequencies and the wearing of face coverings
(masks) by talkers. The proposed studies will establish the ecological utility of extended high frequencies for
speech communication. Valuable insight will be gained as to how extended high-frequency hearing loss
impacts daily living for otherwise normal-hearing listeners. It is expected that results of the proposed studies
will aid in ongoing efforts to (1) improve clinical measures of hearing loss and (2) improve hearing-aid
processing techniques."

The goal of this project is to optimize the management of screen-detected pulmonary nodules thus maximizing
the benefits of lung cancer screening. Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in the US. To
curb the burden of this disease, multiple national organizations recommend lung cancer screening with low-
dose computed tomography (LDCT). However, up to one third of screening LDCTs identify pulmonary nodules
but only 1-3% of these are cancers. Screen-detected pulmonary nodules are then followed-up with additional
imaging tests and, in some cases, invasive and potentially harmful procedures. Follow-up and subsequent
work-up procedures account for a large portion of screening-associated unnecessary harms and costs. An
optimal nodule management algorithm should substantially reduce these harms and provide early cancer
detection benefits. However, the optimal management of pulmonary nodules detected during lung cancer
screening is currently unknown. There are differing major guidelines for LDCT screen-detected lung nodule
management. Most widely implemented guidelines focus on nodule characteristics to decide the need for and
type of follow-up. These guidelines fail to incorporate other key patient factors such as age, sex, smoking
history, and comorbidities. Furthermore, additional factors can heavily impact the diagnostic accuracy and
harms of nodule management strategies and ultimately, the benefits of lung cancer screening. These include:
1) risk of lung cancer based on participant and nodule characteristics; 2) cancer aggressiveness; 3) type,
sequence and timing of nodule follow-up; 4) follow-up and biopsy related complications; 5) competing risks of
death (non-lung cancer mortality); and 6) impact of evaluation on quality of life. Furthermore, differences in
smoking patterns, lung cancer risk, and comorbidities among diverse race and ethnic groups are not
incorporated in current nodule management guidelines. In this project, we will use simulation modeling to
efficiently determine optimal algorithms that consider all the issues listed above. We will build a simulation
model, the Multi-Racial and Ethnic Lung Cancer Model (MELCAM), based on a previous modeling framework
used by our team to extensively study various aspects of lung cancer control. The project Specific Aims are to:
1) Derive and validate MELCAM to simulate the management and subsequent outcomes of screening
participants from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds; 2) Use MELCAM to compare existing nodule
management protocols in terms of overall and quality-adjusted life-year gains and harms; 3) Use MELCAM to
generate nodule management algorithm(s) that consider the impact of both nodule and patient factors on
cancer risk, screening harms, and life expectancy to optimize the types and timing of follow-up procedures;
and 4) Determine the cost-effectiveness of existing and novel follow-up algorithms. Our study is innovative in
applying state-of-the-art modeling techniques and personalized approaches to the optimization of pulmonary
nodule management maximizing the benefits of lung cancer screening in diverse populations."
10934527,"Background: Unrelieved pain is highly prevalent and devastating for Veterans in VA’s 134 Community Living
Centers (CLCs). Imminent removal of pain as one of the CLC quality measures offers an opportunity, per VA’s
Office of Geriatrics and Extended Care (GEC), to develop new, risk-adjusted measures that more accurately
characterize CLC pain management. These measures can identify CLCs successful at pain management while
minimizing biased underestimates for CLCs with the sickest residents. Then, by diving deeply into structures
and processes of high performers, we can learn how to intervene. My background in gerontology, quantitative
methods, and implementation science partially prepares me for this work. But I need additional training in risk
adjustment, qualitative research, cutting-edge analytic methods, and intervention study designs for the study
and my health services research career to succeed.
Specific Aims: The proposed CDA simultaneously fills the considerable gaps in my background and provides
VA with rigorous, actionable research on which to ground future quality improvement efforts. A social-
ecological model frames the work. GEC commits to serving as an invested partner. I have 3 aims, which I will
achieve with my mentors and training.
1. Evaluate how risk adjustment changes judgements of CLC pain management performance.
2. Use mixed methods to perform in-depth studies of CLCs with high outlying performance.
3. Adapt an existing, evidence-based intervention comprising lessons learned from “positive deviants.”
Methods: Aim 1: Using VA administrative data of CLC residents, I will (1) calculate unadjusted pain measures,
(2) apply risk adjustment, (3) assess the measures’ reliability and validity, and (4) identify high and low outlying
performance on pain management. Aim 2: I will use quantitative (survey) and qualitative data from staff and
residents at 5 top-performing CLCs, contrasted with qualitative data from 5 low-performing CLCs, to develop
hypotheses of contextual factors and pain management practices unique to positive deviants. I will test causal
relationships using configurational comparative analytic methods. Aim 3: I will adapt an existing nursing home
pain management intervention for use in VA CLCs, using empirical evidence from Aim 2 about necessary
conditions for optimal pain management. A modified e-Delphi panel of CLC stakeholders and pain
management experts will provide feedback on the intervention package’s design. I will use a developmental
formative evaluation of qualitative data from staff at 1 low-performing CLC to assess the intervention’s
feasibility and acceptability, in preparation for rigorous testing in future work.
Expected Results and Next Steps: I will provide GEC with interim deliverables to enable assessment of CLC
pain management quality, guide CLC policy, and support clinical practice in CLCs struggling with pain
management. Knowledge from this CDA will lead me to develop studies to refine risk adjustment methods for
quality measurement in other critical areas and to rigorously evaluate, using a hybrid type II design, clinical
effectiveness and implementation of the intervention.
Significance & Relevance to Veterans’ Health: Coming at a critical juncture in my VA research career, this
timely study responds to the VA priority of Greater Choice for Veterans, ORD’s priority to increase substantial
real-world impact of VA research, and HSR&D’s Long-term Care and Opioid/Pain priority domains. Although
pain is highly prevalent and debilitating for the 42,000 vulnerable Veterans CLCs serve, almost nothing is
systematically known about CLCs’ pain management quality. And current pain measures are about to
disappear. This study seizes this opportunity, developing nuanced, VA-specific approaches that are custom-
made to reflect the accurate state of CLC pain management and help improve VA long-term care."
10884464,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Our planet is inhabited by trillions of bacteria that live inside and outside of humans. The “skin”, or
surface, of bacteria is called the cell envelope, and functions to separate us from them. Although some bacteria
are symbionts, infection by pathogenic bacteria is still a major cause of death worldwide. While Gram-negative
bacteria contain a protective outer membrane layer absent in most Gram-positives, almost all bacteria contain
polymers composed of unique patterns of glycans that extend from the cell surface. Bacterial surface sugar
polymers, or exo-polysaccharides, act as molecular barcodes that distinguish different strains of bacteria within
a single species. Many bacterial exo-polysaccharides contain rare sugars, which are monosaccharides that are
absent in other organisms, including humans. While exo-polysaccharides are necessary for host infection, we
still lack an understanding of how rare sugar-containing glycan polymers are assembled, recognized, and enable
survival in the host.
 My laboratory seeks to generate chemical and biochemical tools to study bacterial protein and glycan
pathways that enable survival in different environments. Our main areas of focus are: (1) development of small
molecule regulators of bacterial chaperone function; (2) manipulation of cell surface sugar patterns to selectively
label and disable bacteria. This proposal focuses on the latter program, in which we identify rare saccharide
subunits that are unique to Gram-negative cell surface polymers called O-antigens, and represent key epitopes
that mediate interactions with hosts and susceptibility to antibiotics. Over the next five years, we will address the
following questions: (1) Can we improve chemoenzymatic routes to rare sugar precursor substrates? (2) How
do glycosyltransferases recognize rare sugar substrates to build O-antigens? (3) Are O-antigen
glycosyltransferases regulated via protein-protein interactions? (4) What host protein structural motifs are
involved in bacterial rare sugar recognition? (5) Can we identify new host proteins involved in bacterial
recognition? To answer these questions, we will use a multidisciplinary approach, involving a combination of
organic chemistry, chemical biology, biochemistry, microbiology and sequencing-based analyses. This work will
significantly expand our understanding of cellular mechanisms underlying bacterial polysaccharide synthesis,
and will teach us how humans recognize foreign sugars.
Relevance to public health: In addition to providing fundamental insight into the production of bacterial factors
that are important for infection, the results of this proposal will inform novel strategies to disable hard-to-treat
Gram-negative infections by interference of essential host-pathogen interactions, as well as biomolecular
reagents to recognize bacterial oligosaccharide structures for new diagnostics."

Emerging evidence shows that changes in cellular metabolism can induce broad shifts in gene
expression, but the mechanisms underlying this connection are not fully understood. Previous
work has not examined the impact of temporal dynamics on metabolism-induced gene
expression. Recent work in systems biology has shown that oscillations in upstream inputs can
be filtered by gene expression machinery to modulate gene expression, through a process
termed dynamic filtering. Additionally, we have recently shown that cellular metabolic status
fluctuates rapidly in response to various forms of metabolic stress. These cycles drive
asynchronous oscillating activity of transcription factors including FOXO3, a key regulator of
stress genes that plays a role in aging, and TFEB, a central regulator of lysosome and
autophagy genes. We therefore hypothesize that oscillations in metabolic state drive gene
expression programs that are distinct from those under static unstressed conditions. We
propose that dynamics-sensitive gene expression programs can influence cell fate decisions
such as differentiation, cell growth, senescence, inflammation, and drug sensitivity. In this
project, we will investigate how metabolic oscillations control the expression of TFEB and
FOXO3 target genes. We will use live-cell reporters, inducible expression constructs, and other
methods to measure key kinetic parameters in the transcription and translation of target genes.
To identify broader gene expression programs modulated by metabolic dynamics, we will use
mathematical modeling in combination with transcriptome-level profiling. Functional assays will
be used to test how dynamically sensitive gene expression programs alter cell fates. We expect
our study to establish an important unexplored mechanism that explains how short-term
regulation of cellular metabolic status influences chronic diseases including cancer, diabetes,
and aging. Our results will address the outstanding question of how pharmacological metabolic
inhibitors such as metformin provide benefits in cancer and aging. The models generated will
establish a new approach to evaluate candidate pharmacological compounds."

 Injuries or diseases that kill retinal neurons or photoreceptors block vision at it source. The
inability to repair the retina is a hallmark of the human nervous system; neurons that die are not
replaced and functions that are lost are not recovered. This bleak outcome is a driving force for
research on neural stem cells and the field of regeneration biology. The objective of this project
is to undertake novel exploratory studies that will investigate new concepts and characterize
newly-identified cell types that are hypothesized to play key roles during the death and
regeneration of photoreceptors in the vertebrate retina. This work will extend projects in our lab
toward new directions.
 This program of research utilizes the zebrafish retina, the only vertebrate CNS tissue in which
endogenous cells can regenerate a single neuronal type, which integrates into existing synaptic
circuits, or regenerate all cell types that can completely restore the original tissue.
 Two Specific Aims are proposed, each designed to reveal important insights into the cellular
and molecular mechanisms that govern inflammation in subretinal space during photoreceptor
death and regeneration. Specific Aim 1 will explore the role the RPE plays in establishing the
inflammatory mileau within the sub-retinal space during the selective death of cone
photoreceptors. Specific Aim 2 will establish the transcriptomic signature of a newly-identified
population of subretinal microglia, which, like the RPE, have an exclusive relationship to
photoreceptors. Determining how the inflammatory response governs photoreceptor
regeneration will advance our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that govern retinal stem
and progenitor cells and may guide cell-based therapeis for treating retinal injuries and disease
in humans."

Modeling NDE1 function in dysregulated brain development using a microfluidic CNS model
Development of the vertebrate central nervous system (CNS) begins with the formation of neural tube (NT) and
its regional patterning to generate the forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain, and spinal cord. Regional patterning of
the brain is a tightly regulated developmental process, deviation from which can result in neurodevelopmental
brain diseases. Multiple causes are associated with neurodevelopmental brain diseases, including genetic,
environmental, infectious, and traumatic factors. Even though the precise etiology of neurodevelopmental
brain diseases remains largely unknown, the genetic components of neurodevelopmental brain diseases have
been increasingly deciphered with the advent of personalized medicine. However, detailed pathophysiological
mechanisms of neurodevelopmental brain diseases remain challenging to study, due to limited access to
human CNS tissues. Animal models have been instrumental in understanding human neurodevelopment and
associated disorders. However, they are limited in revealing some of the most fundamental aspects of
development, genetics, pathology, and disease mechanisms that are unique to humans. Stem cell-based in
vitro models of human neurodevelopment are emerging as promising experimental tools. However, the
controllability and reproducibility of these models remain suboptimal. Furthermore, none of the current
neurodevelopment models is capable of recapitulating regional patterning of the brain faithfully in a 3D tubular
geometry, a hallmark of neurodevelopment.
 The goal of this R21 project is to specifically address this significant technological need, by using
human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to develop a human brain development model that can faithfully
recapitulate regional brain patterning. Importantly, we propose to apply this model to study the function of
nuclear distribution element 1 (NDE1), a gene implicated in a wide range of neurodevelopmental conditions,
including microcephaly (a small brain), microlissencephaly (a small brain with a simplified gyral pattern), or
microhydranencephaly (a more severe presentation). In our preliminary study, we have successfully leveraged
the developmental potential and self-organizing property of hPSCs in conjunction with innovative microfluidics
to develop the first of its kind, synthetic, fully patterned human NT model. Our preliminary data from brain
organoids generated from NDE1-knockout (KO) hPSCs further show that NDE1-KO brain organoids exhibit
reduced growth and gyrification and furthermore show abnormal brain regionalization. Thus, our preliminary
data suggest a novel and previously unexplored mechanism involving dysregulated brain regionalization in
NDE1-mediated microcephaly. In this proposal, we propose to first extend the microfluidic patterned human
NT model to recapitulate brain regionalization (Aim 1). We will then utilize this controllable human brain
development model and a Nde1-KO mouse model to study the role of NDE1 mutations in dysregulated brain
regionalization (Aim 2)."

Hookworm infection remains one of the most important public health threats worldwide, with an estimated 450
million infected. Heavy hookworm infection is the leading cause of anemia in the tropics, resulting in debilitating
and sometimes fatal iron-deficiency anemia. Children, pregnant women, and the elderly are particularly
susceptible to morbidity from hookworm infection. Control strategies are restricted to periodic de-worming of
infected individuals with benzimidazole (BZ) and other anthelmintics. There is concern that resistance to
anthelmintics will develop with increased use in mass drug administration (MDA) programs used to control
hookworms, which require annual or biannual treatment. The rapidity with which anthelmintic resistance (AR)
developed in parasitic nematodes infecting livestock and companion animals suggest that increasing the
selective pressure on human parasitic nematodes by MDA will rapidly generate resistant worm populations as
well. Resistance is also a major concern for other drugs such as ivermectin (IVM) and pyrantel (PYR) which
are commonly used to treat lymphatic filariasis and soil transmitted nematodes including hookworms.
Molecular tests to monitor the emergence of resistance are necessary, but the genetic mutations that confer
resistance to PYR and IVM are unknown in hookworm. Molecular tests that detect emerging AR in hookworms
can help tailor drug treatments during MDA to be more effective and will be critical to avoid losing the most
effective anthelmintics for hookworm control. Previously, we identified a hookworm strain, named KGR, which
was resistant to the BZ anthelmintic thiabendazole (TBZ) as well as ivermectin (IVM). More recently we
isolated a second independent strain, named BCR, which is resistant to three drugs, TBZ, IVM, and pyrantel
(PYR). We have observed a unique phenotype in the BCR isolate that our preliminary data suggests is linked
to PYR resistance. Activation of infective BCR larvae (iL3) is depressed in response to host signals when
compared to susceptible iL3, and this effect is partially rescued at increased incubation temperature.
Furthermore, our evidence points to a defect in the membrane guanylyl cyclase (mGC) which is a key effector
of activation. We propose to determine the underlying molecular mechanism for this phenotype, and its role in
PYR resistance. In Aim 1, we will identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in functional domains of
mGCs that are unique to the BCR strain and use Caenorhabditis elegans as a surrogate to test the sufficiency
of the mutations in conferring resistance. We will do this by introducing the SNPs in orthologous C. elegans
genes by CRISPR/Cas9 and testing the edited nematodes for PYR resistance. In Aim 2 we will investigate the
heat sensitivity of the defective activation response in BCR larvae. We will determine the role of the heat shock
response and specifically the chaperone HSP90 in rescue of the activation defect in BCR larvae. This proposal
will provide long sought after insight into the mechanism of PYR resistance in hookworms."

 The adaptive immune system consists of highly diverse B- and T-cell receptors, which can recognize and
neutralize a multitude of diverse pathogens. Immune recognition relies on molecular interactions between
immune receptors and pathogens, which in turn is determined by the complementarity of their 3D structures and
amino acid compositions, i.e., their shapes. Immune shape space has been previously introduced as an
abstraction for such molecular recognition to explain how immune repertoires are organized to counter diverse
pathogens. However, the relationships between immune receptor sequence, shape, and specificity are very
difficult to quantify in practice. We propose to use recent advances in machine learning and the wealth of
molecular data to infer an effective shape space, grounded in biophysics of protein interactions. The key is to
find a representation of proteins in general, and of immune receptors, in particular, that reflects the relevant
biophysical properties that determine a protein receptor’s stability, function, and interaction with pathogens.
 Representation learning is a powerful technique in machine learning that uses large amounts of data to
infer a reduced representation. Since protein function is closely related to the 3D structure, we will develop novel
machine learning methods that use atomic coordinates of a protein structure as input and, through
transformations that respect the physical symmetries in the data, learn representations that reflect biophysical
properties of proteins and protein-protein interactions. We believe a key innovation in our approach is the
analysis of amino acid neighborhoods within 3D protein structures. The distribution of these neighborhoods will
reveal how they differ at the surface, in the bulk, and at functionally important regions such as catalytic sites.
The learned protein representation will enable us to characterize how specific compositions of amino acid
neighborhoods are the building blocks of protein structure and protein function. We will transfer the
representation of protein universe to immune receptors to learn the immune shape space. The leaned immune
shape space will enable us to address how affinity and specificity are encoded by immune receptors in different
cell types. We will study how the modular structure of immune receptors, with separate pathogen engaging and
framework regions, enables receptors to diversify and target a multitude of pathogens, without compromising
their stability. We will use the complementary aspect of shape recognition to predict the antigenic targets of the
immune receptors, and through collaborations, we will experimentally validate our predictions.
 Our approach opens a new path towards interpretable computational models of proteins and immune
receptors that describe how biological properties and biological function emerge from protein subunits.
Additionally, the inferred molecular representations can be used as a generative model, where desired
properties, such as antigenic targets, are specified and new proteins can be generated."

Viral transmission from an infected person or an animal to a new host can occur by direct or indirect routes.
During indirect transmission, contaminated surfaces can play an important role. Although there are a number of
methods for disease transmission in healthcare facilities, aerial transmission is often considered an important
route for many organisms. The aerial path followed by pathogens from the source to recipients or surfaces and
their viability upon impaction is affected by many factors, including room air exchange rates and air properties
that may further challenge aerosolized bioparticles, including viruses. As ventilation systems are practically
ubiquitous in the build environment, the effect of air properties on the infectivity and transport of aerosolized
viruses is an important topic for study to reduce the spread of infectious viral particles.
The proposed project is the first known comprehensive study on the impact of environmental conditions
including temperature, humidity, and air velocity on the droplet size, spread, and
deposition/resuspension of airborne viruses. The optimization of environmental conditions that lead to
improved ventilation designs or mitigation strategies could significantly reduce the entrainment and spread of
viable infectious viruses in the built environment. The PIs' have previously shown that a combined modeling and
sampling approach is successful to mitigate transport of airborne infectious microorganisms in a ventilated facility
The goal of this proposal is to understand the effect of environmental conditions on the transmission, deposition
and resuspension of aerosolized virus particles and provide realistic measures to reduce their spread in the
ventilation airflow in nosocomial and healthcare settings. The proposed goal will be achieved by combining
betacoronavirus aerosol collection with biolayer interferometry, molecular dynamics and computational airflow
modeling in model experiments and field testing. The research plan is based on three fundamental questions
about 1) the effect of environmental conditions and surface characteristics on the size distribution, deposition,
and resuspension of virus aerosols using biolayer interferometry, molecular dynamics modeling and
computational flow simulation to visualize the airflow patterns in a 3 scale model hospital room. Elucidating the
relationship between viable virus deposition and resuspension is the key for developing means to reduce
transmission of viruses through airborne exposure; 2) using bioaerosol collectors to determine the rate and
distance aerosolized viruses can spread in different environmental conditions analyzed by cell culture and
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR); and 3) how mitigation efforts based on optimized ventilation can
be applied to hospital settings. This innovative project will help develop and implement interdisciplinary
ventilation design guidelines to educate scientists and engineers about bioaerosol transport and environmental
effects on the spread of viruses in an effort to improve understanding of infectious disease considerations in
design, management, and monitoring of healthcare facilities and other built environment."

on this fact SGLT2 inhibitors promoting glucose excretion are widely used to treat type 2 diabetic patients. To
date, clinical studies suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors suppress the risk for hospitalization and mortality for heart
failure in type 2 diabetic patients. Further, in non-diabetic patients with CHF, SGLT2 inhibitor prevents worsening
heart failure and mortality. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to be involved in the beneficial effects of
SGLT2 inhibitors in CHF. Renal sympathetic nerve activation causes sodium and water retention in CHF. Renal
denervation (RDN) has been shown to reduce sodium retention in rats and dogs with CHF. Activation of the
splanchnic sympathetic nerve leads to volume redistribution such as to contribute to cardiopulmonary congestion
in CHF. Our recent evidence in rats with CHF shows that; 1) levels of SGLT2 expression are dramatically
increased in the proximal tubules of the kidney; 2) the activity of SGLT2 for sodium retention is enhanced; 3)
RDN decreases the levels of SGLT2 expression and SGLT2 activity; 4) norepinephrine upregulates SGLT2
expression and trafficking in the renal tubular cells; and 5) RDN attenuates renal levels of inflammatory cytokines
and renal immune cell activation. Based on these data, we will test the hypothesis that elevated sympathetic
activation in CHF enhances sodium reabsorption and fluid retention by modulation of SGLT2 expression,
trafficking and function. Further, enhanced SGLT2 expression potentiates a vicious positive feedback
between renal inflammation and increases in sympathetic activation (both renal and splanchnic nerves)
in CHF. In AIM 1 we will determine if enhanced expression/activation of renal SGLT2 contributes to the sodium
retention in rats with CHF. In AIM 2 we will determine if RDN or selective afferent renal denervation abrogates
the expression/activation of SGLT2, possibly via renal inflammation in rats with CHF. In Aim 3 we will determine
if SGLT2 inhibition reduces efferent/afferent renal and splanchnic sympathetic activation in rats with CHF. These
aims will be addressed in rats with CHF using complementary methodologies ranging from cellular to the whole
animal level, including physiological measurement of sodium balance, volume status, SGLT2 activity,
electrophysiological recording, SGLT2 trafficking using molecular biology techniques. The successful completion
of the proposed studies will provide significant new information and insight into the contribution of SGLT2
inhibition on renal nerve mediated regulation in altered sodium balance in CHF and the therapeutic benefits of
SGLT2 mediated changes in renal nerve mediated sodium and fluid retention, endemic to CHF."

Considerable evidence suggests a role for diverse antibody (Ab) activities, including Fc receptor (FcR)-
mediated functions in viral load reduction and in blocking HIV-1 acquisition. Although the role of FcR-effector
function in antiviral activity holds across multiple model systems and Abs, mechanistic insights are complicated
by species-specific solutions to balancing potent Ab effector activity with damaging inflammation, distinct
epitope-, effector-, and Ab-specific factors, as well as distinctions between the effector mechanisms available
in blood and tissue.
 Despite evolutionary proximity, significant differences between Rhesus macaque (RM) and human Ab
biology that manifest in different functional characteristics of the Ab isotypes and subclasses, FcRs expressed
on innate immune cells, and their biological interplay. This program will expand this map of how antiviral
activity against HIV-1 is accomplished by diverse effector mechanisms, involving engagement of different
soluble factors and effector cell populations, and distinctive immunoglobulin types in immune-complexes that
vary in their overall architecture and biological activity, in both humans and RM. There is a continuing need to
define this biology in humans and animal models in order to effectively translate insights gained from emerging
protective and therapeutic studies to the clinic, and fuel impactful Ab immunoprophylaxis, cure strategies, and
vaccine designs.

With our participation in this iteration of the Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN),
we contributed to a series of discoveries that enhanced our understanding of disease processes and resulted in
a multitude of potentially effective treatments for critically ill and injured children that require definitive evaluation
in clinical trials. There continues to be tremendous need for a collaborative research network in pediatric critical
care to facilitate the swift and effective translation of scientific and technologic discoveries into clinical advances.
Access to appropriate patients and expertise in the execution of clinical trials must be linked to scientists and
laboratories working within and across disciplines at the cutting edge of scientific advancement. At the University
of Colorado Denver (UCD) and Children’s Hospital Colorado (CHCO), we have a long history of successful
collaborative basic, translational, and clinical science programs focused on pediatric critical illness and injury.
We will provide several unique areas of strength to the CPCCRN, including: 1) a distinctive multidisciplinary team
of collaborative researchers with specific expertise in mechanistic investigations of cardiovascular and
pulmonary diseases, 2) a proven and successful track record as a clinical site in CPCCRN, 3) expertise with
pediatric clinical trials execution, including innovative programs to enhance positive research culture among
clinical staff and participation among patients and families, 4) a 7-state catchment area with high volumes of
critically ill and injured children, 5) an in-house rehabilitation program and extensive outpatient outreach program
capable of providing follow-up care to nearly all our critically ill patients, and 6) a dynamic partnership with the
Children’s Hospital Colorado Research Institute and Colorado Clinical Translational Science Institute to provide
extensive research resources. Our ancillary site, Arkansas Children’s Hospital (ACH) provides 1) experience
with pediatric clinical trials execution, including previous successful membership in CPCCRN 2) provision of care
to nearly all of the critically ill children from the State of Arkansas and a 4-state catchment area, 3) representation
of an Institutional Development Award (IDeA) state (historically received low levels of NIH support) and involving
their unique populations (rural, Marshallese, and medically underserved communities) in the NIH mission, and
4) a rich partnership with the ACH Research Institute and University of Arkansas Clinical Translational Science
Award to provide comprehensive research resources. Utilizing these assets, we will augment the contributions
of CPCCRN to the care of critically ill children through rigorous clinical trial execution, innovative translational
and clinical trial proposals, participation in CPCCRN leadership committees, and training the next generation of
pediatric critical care researchers. The proposed trial of “Personalized Immunomodulation in Sepsis induced
Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome” is an incredibly innovative approach that moves beyond a “one therapy
for all” paradigm to an individualized therapeutic approach that will dramatically improve outcomes for children
with sepsis. We are enthusiastic and committed to participate in this project with the new 24-site CPCCRN."
10894653,"ABSTRACT_Project 1
Major efforts to develop HIV vaccines and other immunoprevention approaches are based on the premise that
anti-Env antibody (Ab) responses will protect against HIV, SIV or SHIV in humans and nonhuman primates
(NHP) if present before exposure. Humoral responses comprise two Ab functions that must be considered for
HIV prevention: direct neutralizing activity, enabled by epitope-paratope interactions; and the recruitment of
antiviral effector cells (NK cells, monocytes, granulocytes), via Fc-Fc receptor interactions. Although
applications of neutralizing activity have been exhaustively studied, the utility of antibody Fc-mediated
functions in HIV prevention is only partially defined. Further, how these functions allow non-neutralizing
antibodies (nnAbs) to afford protective human immunity is an unresolved but significant question as many
nnAbs recognize invariant epitopes, can be raised by vaccination, and recruit Fc-mediated effector functions in
experimental settings. It is likely that past limitations in establishing clear links between protection and nnAb
FC-mediated functions may be explained by an incomplete understanding of target epitope sensitivity, optimal
applications of Abs and/or usage of animal models for efficacy testing. Accordingly, the goal of this project is to
fill these information gaps and determine whether and how Fc-mediated immune functions can be most
effectively employed for the rational design of HIV prevention methods. We will use recent advances in animal
models and Fc-FcR dependent immunity to build new approaches that can bridge epitope presentation
patterns, effector cell recruitment and target cell killing in situ, and protective efficacy in vivo. We will validate
two hypothetical scenarios for Fc-mediated immunity in preventing HIV infection suggested by our data. 1)
Non-neutralizing Abs will exhibit efficacy in a human immune background according to identifiable qualities of
epitope targeting, isotype and Fc-mediated effector mechanism. 2) Polyclonal mixtures of bnAbs and cross-
reactive nnAbs will afford more potent protection in a human immune background than either Ab type alone;
thus affording protective efficacy in vivo at what would otherwise be limiting titers. These will be tested using
novel in vitro systems and immunodeficient mice reconstituted to produce human backgrounds and effector
mechanisms, as well as comparative experiments in RM immune backgrounds. The Specific Aims are:
Aim 1. Identify windows of vulnerability to Fc-mediated activities in a primary infection system.
Aim 2. Demonstrate that nnAbs and their Fc-dependent functions, alone and/or with sub-efficacious
bnAb titers, protect against HIV infection in vivo."
10894660,"ABSTRACT_Project 2
A key goal for HIV-1 vaccine design is the induction of broadly neutralizing responses. Although this goal has
not been achieved, preclinical studies in non-human primates have identified several vaccine strategies that
achieved some level of protection without inducing broadly neutralizing antibodies. These findings and
emerging data from the field indicate that an achievable path forward is to leverage a polyclonal response
comprised of multiple antibody responses that work together to eliminate virus replication. A critical gap in
knowledge is the nature of vaccine-elicited polyclonal antibody responses that can achieve protection against
infection within mucosal tissues in the non-human primates in order to translate into protection in human
clinical trials. Moreover, there is a lack of information on how best to design polyclonal combinations of non-
neutralizing and neutralizing antibodies to recruit Fc-Receptor bearing cells at the mucosal compartment to
leverage different antibody combinations for improved protection. Our central hypothesis is that the
composition of polyclonal Ab responses significantly impacts recruitment of monocytes and NK cells and their
cooperation for Fc-mediated functions. To test our primary hypothesis, we will evaluate combinations of
monoclonal antibody and polyclonal vaccine-induced plasma antibodies for their ability to more efficiently kill
infected cells by examining antibody-dependent cellular mediated killing and/or phagocytosis of infected cells.
We will define the transcriptomic profile of Fc-receptor bearing cells recruited by effective polyclonal
preparations to understand the optimal FcR-bearing cells that should be recruited by effective vaccine-induced
antibodies. These signatures will enable to understand how species-specific FcR and cellular diversity impact
translation from rhesus macaques to humans. Lastly, we will determine differences in the interaction between
FcR-bearing cells recruited by optimal mAb combinations for their ability to eliminate infected cells and secrete
antiviral cytokines with limited pro-inflammatory profile. These questions will be addressed in the following
Aims:
Aim 1. Define contribution of IgG1, IgG3, and IgA for recognition of infected cells and virus particles.
Aim 2. Identify the functional properties of effector cell subsets recruited by IgG1, IgG3, and polyclonal
Ab combinations.
Aim 3. Determine whether monocytes and NK cells are serially recruited to eliminate infected cells."

This research focuses on filling gaps in knowledge about the precise molecular pathways that
underpin retinal inflammation and impact crosstalk from ischemic retinal diseases, including diabetic
retinopathy, vascular diseases, retinopathy of prematurity, and sickle cell retinopathy. Current
treatments are often inadequate to prevent vision loss, and adding selective targeting of additional
inflammatory mediators may offer new vision-saving therapies. We have identified that (1) the pro-
inflammatory cytokine macrophage migration inhibitor factor (MIF) is a druggable target for preventing
retinal gliosis and photoreceptor loss in retinal detachment. (2) MIF is up-regulated in the N-methyl-D-
aspartic acid (NMDA) damage model which simulates ischemia-mediated retinal excitotoxicity;
pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of MIF increases neuronal survival in this model. (3) Clinically we
identified a genetic association of MIF promoter polymorphisms with epiretinal membrane formation.
Müller glia/astrocytes (MG) are the predominant components of ERM suggesting that MIF could play
an important role in the pathological function of retinal glia. MIF inhibitors are in clinical evaluation for a
variety of systemic diseases. While inhibition of MIF’s pro-inflammatory effects may indeed underlie
the enhanced neuronal survival from MIF d-DT inhibitors, our recent findings strongly suggest that
alternative mechanisms also exist. MIF is highly expressed in the Müller glia/astrocytes and it has
been hypothesized to be a glial growth factor. Our preliminary data show that conditional inhibition of
MIF in the MG enhances the survival of retinal neurons during damage and affects the MG JAK/STAT
pathway. Herein, Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that MIF inhibition promotes neuronal survival
in retinal damage by activating the gp130/JAK/STAT signaling pathway of Müller glia/astrocytes. In
chick and murine NMDA models, we will use pharmacologic and genetic approaches to assess the
impact on MG signaling pathways and neuronal survival induced by MIF inhibition. Specific Aim 2 will
test the hypothesis that conditional deletion of Müller glia/astrocyte MIF up-regulates the
gp130/JAK/STAT pathway and enhances the survival of retinal neurons. In Specific Aim 3 we will
develop a single cell RNA-seq database of damaged and undamaged retina treated with MIF inhibitors
and/or MG-specific genetic deletion of MIF. We will comprehensively evaluate the transcriptional
changes at single-cell resolution in the glia and retinal neurons that result from inhibition of MIF. This
research will define the important functional relationships between MIF and signaling pathways on
specific cells during retinal damage. The fundamental knowledge gained from understanding the
transcriptome ‘switch’ will set the stage for future studies targeting key molecular pathways that are
druggable with minimal side effects, but able to prevent and recover visual loss from retinal damage."

10818461,"ABSTRACT: The integration of electrochemical biosensors with microelectronics offers a unique avenue for
miniaturized, low-cost systems that merge biomolecular sensing with digital computing, programming, and
communication. Here we propose to integrate electrochemical aptamer-based sensors (“aptasensors”) into a
microfluidic multi-well platform to enable multi-time-point, highly parallel readouts of cell death and cytokine
secretion from intact tumor biopsies during and after drug treatment. Our platform will allow for gathering the
large amounts of molecular data that are needed for machine learning approaches to drug testing.
Cancer drug testing – a central process in cancer drug development and personalized oncology – is often
inaccurate and inefficient because it typically relies on studies in cell cultures or animals that lack the human
tumor microenvironment (TME). Only <4% of cancer drugs out of the ~1,000 drugs in clinical trials each year
pass the safety and efficacy tests; more than half of the failures are due to lack of efficacy. Hence, on average,
bringing a drug to market takes >10 years and costs >$1 billion, often resulting in high prices for the drugs. In
the last decade, technologies such as patient-derived organoids and organs-on-chips have brought some hope.
However, these approaches have much lower throughput than traditional cell cultures and are generally unable
to fully recreate the TME of an intact tissue. These limitations are a fundamental hurdle for the personalization
of therapies which often need to be customized to the unique TME of the patient, and also for the development
of combination immunotherapies, which target the TME and are exponentially increasing in number. Thus, a
different paradigm for drug testing that preserves the human TME is critically needed to help transition oncology
into a stage of more affordable and rapidly evolving treatments.
The Folch and Gujral labs have developed an intact-tissue microfluidic drug testing platform based on regularly-
sized, cuboidal-shaped microdissected tissues (referred to as “cuboids”) that are mechanically cut with a tissue
chopper. In under an hour, more than 10,000 cuboids (~400 µm-wide) can be produced from ~1 cm3 of solid
tumor. The cuboids are never dissociated and retain much of the native TME (e.g. immune cells and
microvasculature). The platform is a user-friendly multi-well device that can microfluidically trap and selectively
treat a large array of cuboids. Here we propose to integrate electrochemical aptasensors into our cuboids
platform to enable the automated, multi-time-point monitoring of secreted compounds (cytokines or cell death
indicators) within the wells and the straightforward implementation of electrical readouts from large cuboid arrays.
As a proof of concept, we will use cuboids from mouse tumors and patient samples in a 96-well format. We will
use a mouse model and patient samples of colorectal cancer (CRC) liver metastases. Using machine learning
techniques, we will implement a proof-of-concept drug screen on mouse cuboids and a proof-of-concept
combination immunotherapy drug evaluation on patient cuboids."

10812429,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Population coding is a fundamental strategy that the nervous system employs to represent sensory stimulus
and generate perception. In neural networks that perform population coding (termed “population coding
networks (PCNs)”), input-elicited responses are quantitatively heterogeneous across neurons and the
response of a single neuron does not sufficiently define the stimulus; instead, the computed response of the
entire population of neurons underlies the perception of the stimulus. Despite the importance of PCNs, very
little is known about how they are assembled during development. The objective of the proposed research
is to identify the mechanisms that establish a PCN during development. In many PCNs, the constituent
neurons are not distinguishable from each other, except by their heterogeneous physiological properties.
While the apparent homogeneity of these PCNs ensures that constituent neurons contribute to the same
brain function, it also poses a challenge for studying the molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie
the assembly of PCNs. A recent study reported a neural network that encodes the intensity of noxious
inputs through population coding in Drosophila larvae, which offers an excellent system for studying PCN
assembly. Preliminary results suggest that Hox genes are involved in establishing this PCN. The central
hypothesis is that a post-mitotic Hox code specifies the synaptic inputs to different neurons along the A-P
axis, establishing a population-coding network that encodes stimulus intensity. This hypothesis will be
tested by identifying the cellular (Aim 1) and molecular (Aim 2) mechanisms that establish the heterogeneity
of the neurons in this PCN. The proposed research is innovative because it proposes novel cellular and
molecular mechanisms that generate quantitative heterogeneity in a neural network. Moreover, it will use a
newly developed technique that is ideally suited for studying neuronal population activity in the PCN. Novel
genetic tools have also been developed for accessing subpopulation of neurons in the PCN. This research
is significant because it will provide cellular, molecular, and conceptual insights into the establishment of
other PCNs in Drosophila and other species. Beyond the PCNs, it will inform how physiological
heterogeneity arises in a seemingly identical group of neurons. Furthermore, the successful completion of
the proposed study will also demonstrate a Hox-based matching system that establish neuronal
connections confined to specific rostrocaudal segments."

Volume electron microscopy is the only technique to-date that provides both sufficient resolution (<20 nm) and sufficient
field of view (>100 μm) for the dense reconstruction of neuronal wiring diagrams. Currently, there exist two systems that
have already delivered mm3-sized synaptic resolution electron microscopy stacks: Multi-beam scanning electron
microscopy(Eberle et al. 2015; Ren and Kruit 2016) (mSEM) and Gridtape-based automated transmission electron
microscopy(Yin et al. 2020; Maniates-Selvin et al. 2020) (Gridtape-TEM). In mSEM, the sample is scanned with up to 91
parallel beams and an image is formed by low energy secondary electrons that are generated during scanning.
Gridtape-TEM detects transmitted electrons with one or multiple fast cameras simultaneously. Both techniques currently
rely on collecting and imaging thousands of ultrathin serial sections (30 - 40 nm) that are being cut with a diamond knife
on an ultramicrotome. For mSEM, the sections are either collected using an automated tape collecting ultramicrotome or
directly onto silicon wafers. For Gridtape-TEM, the sections are collected onto an electron-transparent film in
millimeter-sized apertures on Gridtape. However, serial collection of ultrathin sections is delicate and inherently prone to
failures and artifacts such as section loss, folds and cracks or knife marks. More than 50% of the errors of today’s
state-of-the-art automated neuron segmentation algorithms can be attributed to missing information due to
serial-sectioning. As a consequence, more than 40 hours of manual segmentation proofreading by human experts are
currently required to accurately reconstruct a single cortical pyramidal cell. Some of the remaining automated
segmentation issues can certainly be addressed by improving the underlying algorithms. But in order to scale dense
automated neuronal circuit reconstructions to whole mouse brains with about 70 million neurons, it is necessary to
significantly reduce the experimental artifacts. The collection of semi-thin sections with a thickness around 100 - 500 nm
has been proposed as a much more robust alternative to ultrathin sectioning. In order to maintain or even increase the
resolution in Z, these semi-thin sections could be iteratively milled and scanned in the case of mSEM or a series of images
at different tilt angles could be acquired in the case of Gridtape-TEM. Here we propose to combine the commercially
available multi-beam scanning transmission electron microscope FASTEM from Delmic with iterative broad ion beam
milling of semi-thin sections (BIB-mSTEM). First, hundreds of semi-thin sections will be collected directly onto
scintillator plates using the commercially available MagC magnetic collection system. Subsequently, these sections will be
iteratively thinned and imaged by going back and forth between broad ion beam milling and imaging with FASTEM. For
each section, this will produce a series of iteratively milled TEM projection images that can be used to reconstruct a
high-resolution 3d stack of each section. BIB-mSTEM will be substantially more robust and reliable than mSEM and
Gridtape-TEM based workflows: In contrast to Gridtape-TEM, the sections are collected onto a solid substrate and not on
a fragile support film. In contrast to mSEM, BIB-mSTEM forms the image from high energy transmitted electrons that are
much less sensitive to local electromagnetic fields and milling-induced irregular surface topography than low energy
secondary electrons."
10909273,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an enormous public health problem that affects up to 20% of hospitalized patients,
is strongly associated with morbidity and mortality, and carries a high financial toll. Nowhere is this more
apparent than in the Southeastern US, which is disproportionately affected by kidney disease and its
complications. AKI is an important risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD), cardiovascular disease, poor
health-related quality of life (HRQoL), rehospitalizations, and death after hospital discharge. Improving the
quality of care following hospitalization has been recognized by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive
and Kidney Diseases and other stakeholders as a critical opportunity to reduce the risk for these long-term
complications. Despite this emphasis, care of AKI survivors is often poor and fragmented, and patients face
both systemic and individual-level barriers to optimal care. These include poor access to nephrology-specific
care elements such as monitoring of kidney function for recovery or recurrent AKI, risk factor identification and
modification for kidney disease progression, medication reconciliation and nephrotoxin avoidance, use of
kidney and cardioprotective medications, and appropriate patient and caregiver education. In addition, many
patients also experience poor quality of life and other barriers to care, including a heavy symptom burden and
fatigue, limited mobility, reduced access to transportation or ability to miss work that can further limit
engagement in care. This application will perform a randomized clinical trial designed to examine whether two
interventions delivered remotely via telehealth can overcome these barriers to reduce clinical complications
and improve health-related quality of life among patients discharged from the hospital with moderate to severe
AKI. Two interventions will be tested over a 90-day period following hospital discharge. The first intervention
is a ‘post-hospitalization AKI care bundle’ designed to optimize care that includes monitoring of kidney health,
medication safety review and reconciliation, patient and caregiver education, and identification of modifiable
risk factors for further loss of kidney function. The second intervention is cognitive-behavioral based physical
therapy (CBPT), a novel home-based intervention that couples self-directed exercise with cognitive-behavioral
strategies that can reduce patient’s perception of symptoms and improve engagement and functional status.
We will test the ability of these interventions to improve clinical outcomes after AKI such as
rehospitalizations/emergency room visits, recurrent AKI, death, and kidney function at 90 days. We will also
evaluate health-related quality of life and symptom burden. Patients will be followed for up to 12 months after
enrollment to examine the longer-term impact of these interventions. The study will be performed at Vanderbilt
University Medical Center (PI Siew) and University of Alabama Birmingham (MPI Gutierrez), two academic
medical centers in the Southeast with diverse patient populations and robust infrastructures to support the
proposed work and objectives of the Caring for Outpatients after Acute Kidney Injury (COPE-AKI) Consortium."

 This multi-PI basic science project aims to transform understanding of G-protein function in physiology
and disease, and provide broadly applicable routes for developing therapeutics to treat currently untreatable
diseases caused by mutant constitutively active G protein α-subunits. It does so by developing knowledge
required to design and synthesize, at scales required for preclinical and eventual clinical studies, a family of
bioavailable inhibitors, each of which selectively targets closely related groups of heterotrimeric G proteins.
The translational/clinical potential of this approach is based on recent studies indicating that a bioavailable
inhibitor that targets G protein α-subunits of the Gq/11 class is therapeutically effective in mouse models of
uveal melanoma, an untreatable disease that is driven by mutant constitutively active Gq/11. Similar
approaches could have broad impact, because many other untreatable diseases are driven by various types of
mutant constitutively active G protein α-subunits, including hormone-secreting pituitary tumors, mucosal
melanoma, choroidal hemangiomas, hepatic small-vessel neoplasms, ~10-15% of all cancers, Sturge-Weber
syndrome, autosomal dominant hypoparathyroidism, and certain forms of hyper- and hypocalcemia. Moreover,
this approach could be used to modulate G-protein activity in diseases where GPCR-targeted drugs are
ineffective due to receptor redundancy or to G proteins that cause dose-limiting side effects such as
respiratory suppression or drug tolerance.
 Bioavailable inhibitors that directly target specific subclasses of G proteins would be extremely valuable
for basic science. They would provide simple, fast, cheap and reliable chemical probes with which to identify
novel functions of G proteins in normal physiology and in animal models of disease, in contrast to conventional
knockout or knockdown strategies, which are slow and expensive, and can suffer from compensatory or off-
target effects.
 The foundation of this project is a pair of nearly identical, bioavailable, cyclic depsipeptide natural
products that potently and selectively inhibit the Gq/11 subfamily of G protein α-subunits. The Specific Aims of
this project will address four crucial challenges: 1) limited availability of these inhibitors; 2) lack of inhibitor
derivatives that could be targeted to disease tissues for chronic therapy; 3) limited understanding of the
inhibitory mechanism, which has precluded design of inhibitors that target other subtypes of G proteins; and 4)
absence of inhibitors that selectively target G protein subtypes other than Gq/11. These Aims will be pursued
by using innovative synthetic organic chemistry, computational-based docking and inhibitor design, single-
molecule FRET, NMR, and biochemical and cell-based assays of G protein function."
10893447,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Over the past few decades, viral hepatitis has become a leading cause of death globally, causing more deaths
each year than malaria, HIV/AIDS, or tuberculosis. When considering Hepatitis B (HBV), this large burden of
disease is largely driven by childhood infections, as 90% of infants infected with HBV will develop chronic
hepatitis with lifelong sequelae. Childhood HBV infection occurs through vertical transmission (from mothers to
children during childbirth) and through horizontal transmission (between members of the same household or
community). In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where HBV remains endemic, children are vaccinated against HBV
at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age. This schedule does not protect against vertical transmission, and an estimated
1% of newborns (367,250 infants) in SSA continue to be infected with HBV at birth each year. Administration of
the monovalent HBV vaccine at birth has been shown to have up to 95% protective efficacy against vertical
transmission in the WHO Western Pacific region. However, few studies have been conducted to
characterize the potential impact of providing a birth dose of HBV vaccine in sub-Saharan African
settings. Our partners for this project, the Ministry of Health in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
are particularly interested in understanding whether to adopt a national HBV birth dose intervention.
This translational study will provide estimates of the effectiveness and impact of a 4-dose HBV vaccine series
(including a birth dose) in the DRC. The proposed research will utilize previously collected data and dried blood
spots from two trials in Kinshasa Province, DRC: the Birth Dose Immunogenicity Study and the Continuous
Quality Improvement Study. Using advanced epidemiological methods and mathematical modeling, this
proposal aims to 1) compare the proportion of infants who achieve protective immunity to HBV at 12
months of age by vaccine dose series and mothers' HBV and HIV status and 2) model the impact of
adopting a national 4-dose HBV vaccine series, including the birth dose, on the incidence of HBV in
children under 5 in the DRC. The results will provide valuable estimates of the immunogenicity and potential
impact of an HBV birth dose that will inform vaccine policy in the DRC and greater sub-Saharan African region.
Through the completion of these research aims, the trainee will gain a unique set of skills in advanced
epidemiologic methods, mathematical modeling, and vaccine intervention research. Expert mentors in
vaccinology, immunology, modeling, and epidemiology will support the trainee's successful completion of the
proposed research, associated training plan, and MD/PhD degree at the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill. This F30 fellowship will aid the applicant's development as a future interdisciplinary physician-scientist
practicing at the intersection of infectious disease, infant health, and interventional epidemiology."
10888187,"Abstract
Substance use disorder (SUD) is a common and debilitating condition characterized by compulsive use of an
addictive substance, inability to control the use of this substance, and the emergence of withdrawal symptoms
in the absence of the substance. Despite great advances in our understanding of changes that occur in various
brain regions in the context of addiction/SUD, there is a limited understanding of the diversity of cell types and
gene expression profiles of cells within these human brain regions, and how exposures to addictive substances
such as opioids and cocaine influence the molecular properties and functions of these cells. Over 50% of HIV-
infected patients experience neurological disorders collectively termed HIV-Associated Neurocognitive
Disorders (HAND), which ranges from the asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment to severely disabling
dementia. The use of addictive substances by HIV-infected individuals has been linked to diminished immune
function, increased neuroinflammation and neuronal injury, and exacerbation of HAND. Here, we seek to
directly dissect the common and distinct molecular bases of SUD/HIV infection/HAND effects on distinct cell
types by systematic profiling, dissection, computational integration, and experimental validation of their
transcriptional, epigenomic, and genetic signatures across individuals, brain regions, and cell types. Aim 1: We
use genetic, epigenomic, and transcriptional profiles, generating a total of ~28 million genome-wide maps at
the single-cell (sc) level using 2,800 samples with 10,000 cells per sample; these span 7 brain regions
(prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area, dorsal striatum, insula, amygdala,
hippocampus), two assays (scRNA, scATAC), four phenotypic groups (SUD+/HIV+, SUD+/HIV-, SUD-/HIV+,
SUD-/HIV-), and a total of 200 subjects (50 in each phenotypic group). Aim 2: We integrate these datasets to
predict driver genes, regulatory regions, variants, and pathways, and the cell types and brain regions where
they act. Aim 3: We validate high-priority findings at the molecular level, and functionally validate the highest
priority targets’ ability to modulate addictive behaviors in mouse models of in vivo cocaine self-administration.
The resulting datasets will help guide the search for new therapeutics, by providing detailed therapeutic
targets, and the specific conditions where they are predicted to act."
10850836,"Common complications of portal hypertension include gastroesophageal varices, ascites, and portasystemic
encephalopathy. Patients with cirrhosis have a 5-10% yearly incidence of variceal formation, and a 4-15% yearly
incidence of bleeding. Each bleeding episode carries up to a 20% risk of death. Consequently, the development
of an accurate and noninvasive technique for measurement of portal venous pressure would represent a major
advance in the diagnosis and management of portal hypertension. Currently, clinicians evaluate portal
hypertension invasively through the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) determined by the gradient in
pressure readings between wedged and free hepatic vein catheter positions via a transjugular approach. Our
group developed the fundamental concept of contrast-enhanced subharmonic-aided pressure estimation
(SHAPE). We conducted a first-in-humans pilot study of this technique’s ability to estimate portal pressures in
45 adult patients with HVPG measurements supported by an NIDDK Challenge Grant (RC1 DK087365), which
showed significantly higher SHAPE gradients between the portal and hepatic veins in subjects with clinically
significant portal hypertension (CSPH; HVPG>10 mmHg) than in those with lower HVPGs (1.37±0.59 dB vs. -
1.68±0.27 dB, p<0.001). Recently, we expanded on the concept of using SHAPE for portal pressure estimation
in a larger multi-center trial (supported by this grant i.e., R01 DK098526). Results from 178 subjects across two
sites using modified GE Logic 9 systems were very encouraging with an accuracy for diagnosing CSPH of 95%
(with a 95% confidence interval (CI): 89%-99%, p<0.001) and achieving a sensitivity of 91% (95% CI: 88%-93%)
and a specificity of 82% (95% CI: 75%-85%). The development of SHAPE as an accurate noninvasive technique
for measurement of portal venous pressure represents a major advance in the diagnosis and management of
portal hypertension. This has encouraged us to bring together researchers and clinicians from Thomas Jefferson
University (TJU), the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP) and University of Bern (UB) with a premier
manufacturer of ultrasound scanners (GE) in order to expand on the clinical utility of SHAPE for the management
of portal hypertension. We will conduct large-scale clinical trials of SHAPE in patients with compensated cirrhosis
undergoing routine hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance (N=210) as well as in patients (N=276) treated for
portal hypertension (in particular with non-selective beta blockers) and (as a secondary aim) in patients (N=96)
that may need to undergo screening of varices using a state-of-the-art ultrasound scanner (Logiq E10, GE
Healthcare, Waukesha, WI). Finally, we will study 78 subjects with CSPH scheduled for transjugular
HVPG measurements using two different ultrasound contrast agents in the same subjects to determine
the reproducibility of SHAPE. Hence, this renewal study aims to further develop a novel, shareable and
innovative ultrasound based technology (i.e., SHAPE) for the noninvasive evaluation of portal hypertension and
to establish the clinical utility of SHAPE for the management of portal hypertension."

foundations (i.e., Parker B Francis, CFF, American Heart Association (AHA), Cincinnati Children’s Research
Foundation (CCRF), to name a few). In addition, we will also encourage established investigators who wish
to extend their research program into personalized CF medicine research. It is the intention of the PCFC to
encourage these investigators to develop an innovative research program that would blaze new trails in the

Dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of vision loss in the Western World with a
complex etiology. The fundamental abnormalities occurring in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, resulting in
their progressive dysfunction and subsequent atrophy in AMD, are still not known. However, candidate
pathogenic pathways linked to development of disease have emerged from the convergence of a sundry of
epidemiological, genetic, morphological, and biochemical studies, including inflammation, lipid dysregulation,
apoptosis, and RPE barrier dysfunction among others. Currently there are no drugs available to treat dry AMD.
However, targeting a potential master regulator of these pathways is one avenue to pursue.
Our overarching goal is to discover molecular mechanisms by which nuclear receptors modulate pathologies
characteristic of AMD. In this proposal we concentrate on investigating the biology and function of NURR1
(NR4A1, Nuclear Receptor Related-1 protein), an orphan nuclear receptor, in cells vulnerable in AMD. Studies
of the central nervous system as well as some systemic diseases have revealed NURR1 as a regulator of a
variety of biological processes including cellular proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, inflammation, lipid
homeostasis and metabolism, highlighting its importance in overall cell health. However, as a nuclear receptor,
its role has also been shown to vary and be ligand and cell/tissue specific. Given the overlap between process
regulated by NURR1 and those important in the development and progression of AMD, we propose to
systematically investigate NURR1’s role and potential for therapeutic targeting in ocular cells including RPE, as
this has yet to be discovered.
Herein we build on preliminary observations including (1) NURR1 expression in human RPE cells decreases
with age; (2) NURR1 accumulates extracellularly in drusen and basal deposits of human AMD donor tissue; (3)
NURR1 activation attenuates TNFa-induced RPE epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) transition in vitro; and (4)
oral administration of a NURR1 activating ligand ameliorates visual function deficits in a mouse model featuring
several dry AMD phenotypes. Our findings collectively support an age-related compromise in NURR1-
mechanisms in RPE cellular homeostasis. Based on our preliminary data we propose three specific aims to test
the hypothesis that NURR1 represents a therapeutic target for AMD by simultaneously regulating aberrant
RPE barrier function, cellular lipid metabolism, and inflammation, in cells vulnerable in AMD."

Sudden cardiac death is a leading cause of mortality in the United States and often results from cardiac
arrhythmias. Mutations in Na+ channels, particularly in their carboxy terminal domains (CTDs), dysregulate beat-
to-beat cycling of Na+ and Ca2+, and thereby, precipitate arrhythmias. Similarly, mutations in calmodulin (CaM),
which closely regulates these channels, are also linked to arrhythmias. However, the role of Na+ channels in
arrhythmogenesis remains unclear. NavCTD mutations, which alter the affinity of Nav CaM, impair fast
inactivation and induce proarrhythmic late Nav current (INa). This particularly is evident for Nav isoforms which
exhibits the lowest CaM affinity and correspondingly, the largest of late INa magnitude relative to peak INa. Our
recent studies indicate an important role for these Nav isoforms in late INa-mediated arrhythmias. However, the
arrhythmogenic impact of Nav dysregulation in calmodulin-driven arrhythmias remains unclear. Based on strong
preliminary data from our laboratory, we hypothesize that affinity of CaM for Nav will dictate the magnitude of
arrhythmogenic late INa. Diminished CaM binding to the NavCTD will increase late INa, while enhanced binding
will hasten channel inactivation, mitigating proarrhythmic late INa. Thus, we propose to: 1) Assess the extent and
mechanism of NaV dysregulation by CaM. 2) Elucidate the relative contribution of mutant CaM-mediated Nav
dysfunction to calmodulinopathy associated arrhythmias. 3) Examine the antiarrhythmic potential of enhancing
CaM-Nav interaction. Thus, by understanding calmodulinopathies, we aim to discover approaches to prevent
arrhythmias stemming from both aberrant CaM-NaV interaction and abnormal NaV function."

Angiogenesis is required for proper development of the embryonic circulatory system and is an important step
in the progression of many eye diseases, including retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Therefore, understanding
how the normal regulatory mechanisms in the retina keep angiogenesis in check has great clinical implications.
We recently showed global deletion of Bim, a proapoptotic member of Bcl-2 family of proteins, protects the
developing retinal vasculature from hyperoxia–mediated vessel obliteration and ischemia-mediated
neovascularization in the preclinical mouse model of ROP, the oxygen-induced ischemia retinopathy (OIR)
model. In addition, we showed that targeted deletion of Bim in retinal endothelial cells, pericytes or astrocytes
does not protect the developing retinal vasculature from exposure to hyperoxia–mediated vessel obliteration or
from ischemia-mediated neovascularization. These results strongly support an important role for Bim expression
in retinal inner neurons in proper regulation of developing retinal vasculature. Our hypothesis is that Bim
expression in retinal neurons plays a central role in deriving the sensitivity of developing retinal vasculature to
hyperoxia–mediated vessel obliteration and ischemia–mediated retinal neovascularization during ROP. In Aim
1, we will determine the contribution of Bim expression in the inner retinal neurons to hyperoxia-induced vascular
damage. In Aim 2, we will determine the contribution of VEGF expression in the inner retinal neurons to
hyperoxia-induced vascular damage. Understanding how Bim expression in retinal neurons regulates retinal
vascular development and enhanced sensitivity to hyperoxia will provide insight into Bim mechanisms of action
and aid in the development of alternative ways to modulate retinal angiogenesis."

 The overall goal is to design and select two classes of metalloenzymes, metalloprotein enzymes and metallo-
DNAzymes, and to explore their applications in biocatalysis, bioimaging, and genetic engineering.
 In the first project, we plan to achieve a holistic understanding of complex heteronuclear metalloenzymes
involved in multi-electron processes, specifically structural features in nitric oxide reductases (NOR), heme-
copper oxidases (HCO) and sulfite reductases (SiR) responsible for efficient and selective 2-, 4-, and 6 electron
catalytic reduction of NO, O2, and SO32-, respectively. Even though much progress has been made in studying
individual enzymes, a major gap in our knowledge is what structural features are responsible for the differences
in their functions. To fill this gap, we plan to use small and stable proteins as “scaffolds” to make “biosynthetic
models” of native enzymes with similarly high activity. By placing different heme–nonheme metal ions into the
same protein scaffold, we plan to a) understand how a heme-Cu center can exhibit either HCO or SiR activity;
b) elucidate structural features responsible for catalytic activity and substrate binding affinity in SiR; c) clarify the
roles of tyrosine in HCO and SiR activities; and d) investigate roles of heme cofactors in HCO, NOR, and SiR
activities. Accomplishing this goal will offer deeper insight into metalloprotein structure, function, and design, and
have a broad impact on biocatalysis, allowing design of biocatalysts for biochemical and biomedical applications.
 In the second project, we plan to select DNAzymes with high selectivity for different metal ions with oxidation
state specificity and explore applications of these DNAzymes as imaging agents for paramagnetic metal ions
(PMIs) such as Fe and its Fe2+/Fe3+ redox cycle in living organisms. While progress has been made in developing
sensors for metal ions, sensors that can selectively detect PMIs are limited; few, if any, can detect two oxidation
states of the same metal ions simultaneously. To overcome this barrier, we have obtained DNAzymes sensors
with high selectivity for either Fe2+ or Fe3+ using in vitro selection and demonstrated imaging of both Fe2+ and
Fe3+ simultaneously in living cells using catalytic beacons. We plan to develop methods for spatiotemporal control
of DNAzyme-based imaging and for intracellular generation of DNAzymes to explore their imaging applications.
Accomplishing this goal will offer deeper insight into the roles of PMIs and their redox cycles in processes such
as ferroptosis that has been associated with neurodegenerative diseases and bacterial infections.
 Finally, in a high-risk and high-return endeavor, we propose to expand DNAzyme’s applications as new
genetic engineering tools for cleaving double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and for genome editing, as alternatives to
protein restriction enzymes and CRISPR/Cas, respectively. To achieve the goal, we plan to develop novel
peptide nucleic acid-assisted DNAzymes for dsDNA cleavage and then establish an intracellular gene-editing
platform. Achieving this goal will allow smaller and more robust DNAzymes for highly customizable recombinant
DNA cloning and high-fidelity genome editing."

Cardiovascular complications of cancer therapy significantly contribute to the global burden of cardiovascular
diseases. Although remarkable progress has been made in understanding the genetic basis of doxorubicin-
induced cardiotoxicity (DIC), we cannot predict which patients will be affected by DIC or protect patients at risk
for suffering from DIC adequately. Here, we will use a novel multiplexing methodology of creating a ""cell village""
by pooling multiple patients' induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines in a dish to map the genetic basis of inter-
individual differences in response to doxorubicin. In Aim 1, we will co-culture 100 iPSC lines in 10 distinct ""cell
villages,"" where each ""cell village"" contains ten independent patient-specific iPSC lines. Next, we will differentiate
each ""cell village"" into iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs). Finally, we will perform a single-cell multi-
omics sequencing analysis of the ""cell villages"" to understand the impact of genetic variability on cardiomyocyte
gene regulation and functions at baseline. In Aim 2, we will employ a single-cell multi-omic approach to uncover
and validate the role of response eQTL in DIC prediction. We will treat iPSC-CMs in each ""cell village"" with
doxorubicin at various doses. Next, we will perform single-cell multi-omics profiling to model the contribution of
genetics to variability in responses to doxorubicin treatment. In Aim 3, we will employ 3D engineered heart tissues
(EHTs) and CRISPR/cas9 genome-editing to comprehensively study the functional role of two candidate
doxorubicin response genes. All in all, the proposed experiments will serve as a proof-of- principle in using the
""cell village"" model as a high throughput personalized drug screening platform."
10775828,"Abstract
 Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the most important human pathogens. There are approximately 300 million
chronic HBV carriers in the world, resulting in nearly 1 million deaths every year. Most chronic HBV carriers
acquired the virus from their infected mother early in life. HBV has a very narrow host range, which has greatly
hampered its research. By crossing female hemizygous HBV transgenic mice that carry the 1.3mer overlength
HBV genome to male naïve mice, we had developed a mouse model to study the mechanism of HBV persistence.
We found that the persistence of HBV in mice was dependent on the HBV e antigen (HBeAg) and Kupffer cells,
the resident macrophages of the liver. The requirement of HBeAg for HBV persistence is consistent with the
clinical observation that the HBV persistence in babies is dependent on the HBeAg-positivity of their mothers.
Our recent studies revealed an interesting interplay between HBeAg and hepatic macrophages. This interplay
can either promote the HBV persistence or HBV clearance. In this application, we will continue to study this
interplay between HBeAg and macrophages to understand the mechanism of HBV persistence. We had recently
discovered that HBeAg could reprogram the metabolism of macrophages to promote the oxidative
phosphorylation (OXPHOS). This metabolic reprogramming by HBeAg appears to be important for the
attenuation of pro-inflammatory activities of Kupffer cells. We will therefore continue to study how HBeAg
reprograms the metabolism of macrophages and study the implication of this reprogramming in the anti-HBV
response. Our preliminary results also indicated that the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) mediated the effects of HBeAg
on Kupffer cells. Thus, we will also investigate whether TLR4 serves as the receptor of HBeAg and its role in
HBV persistence. Finally, we will determine whether HBeAg by itself is sufficient to promote HBV persistence
and whether HBeAg can train Kupffer cells in utero to promote HBV persistence. Our proposed studies will
provide important information for us to understand the mechanism of HBV persistence and help to improve the
treatments for chronic HBV patients."

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults. AAA rupture
carries a ≥ 65% mortality rate. There are no direct pharmaceutical treatments for AAA, so the main
management options are screening, secondary risk factor intervention, and surgical repair for large AAAs,
which carries risk. Our previously funded AAA R01 “Identifying Epidemiological Risk Factors for Abdominal
Aortic Aneurysm” established one of the few large population-based prospective US cohorts to identify
etiologic risk factors for incident AAA. Among 15,792 ARIC participants followed for more than two decades,
we ascertained 665 AAAs, identified novel middle-age risk markers for AAA, and estimated the lifetime risk for
AAA from age 45 to be 5.6%. Building upon our original R01 and an ongoing proteomic project in ARIC, we
propose a 4-year study to identify proteomics risk markers and investigate novel mechanisms and etiological
pathways for AAA. Our specific aims are to: (1) Leverage a large panel of aptamer-based, plasma proteomics
data (n=4,931 human proteins) in the entire ARIC cohort from Visits 2 and 3, to conduct a prospective study of
proteomic risk markers for AAA (n=552 cases) over 24 years of follow-up, and to replicate significant proteins
identified in nested AAA case (n=518)-cohort (n=833) samples from the prospective, population-based HUNT3
and SCCS studies. We will use a combination of targeted and agnostic approaches. To ensure the accuracy
and generalizability of our findings, we will also identify commercial assays or develop targeted quantitative
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry assays for the top 5 novel, replicated, aptameric-based proteins and
then compare the targeted protein levels with the aptamer-based measurements in 200 ARIC plasma samples.
(2) Conduct genome-wide association study (GWAS) in ARIC for proteins identified and replicated in Aim 1,
and replicate any significant genetic associations in HUNT3 (n=4,230), MESA (n=5,351), and published protein
GWAS database. We will also conduct a Mendelian randomization study, incorporating data from the
international AAA GWAS Consortium (10,204 AAAs and 107,766 controls), to elucidate the causal relation
between significant protein biomarkers and AAA, followed by a network analysis to integrate the genomic and
proteomic findings.
This study will use unsurpassed proteomic resource in ARIC and other cohorts to identify new risk factors and
mediators of AAA, with potential implications for AAA prevention and treatment."

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common dose-limiting side effect of cancer
treatment drugs that often presents as debilitating pain in a stocking-and-glove distribution. One plausible
solution is spinal cord stimulation (SCS), a minimally invasive treatment used for refractory neuropathic pain
conditions, yet the utility in CIPN pain treatment is unclear. SCS was historically thought to mediate pain
inhibition via the gate-control theory, whereby electrical stimulation of the dorsal column activates Aβ afferents,
which then inhibit nociceptive afferents (Aδ and C fibers); however, novel waveforms act independent of Aβ
activation and a number of non-neuronal mechanisms have been proposed. Accordingly, the long-term goals
of this application are to delineate the neuroimmune mechanisms of SCS-induced CIPN pain inhibition. The
central hypothesis is that SCS can prevent CIPN pain and enhance chemo-efficacy. This hypothesis will be
tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine the electrical parameters of SCS for prevention of painful
CIPN and the underlying neuroimmune mechanisms in the rodent PNS. 2) Determine the vascular and
immune mechanisms of SCS-enhanced chemo-efficacy in the tumor microenvironment of human non-small
cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). 3) Elucidate CIPN-associated mechanisms of neuronal hyperexcitability and
neuropathic pain in human dorsal root ganglia (DRG). The proposed studies take advantage of state-of-the-art
neuroscience tools (calcium imaging, electrophysiology) coupled with cancer-biology and neuroimmunology to
delineate how SCS mediates CIPN pain inhibition and enhances paclitaxel efficacy. This work is significant
with direct translational relevance since rational SCS parameter selection for CIPN pain treatment and
improved chemo-efficacy will lead to improved patient outcomes. Dr. Eellan Sivanesan is a clinician-scientist
whose career goals are to become an independently funded cancer pain researcher and a leader in the field of
neuromodulation. Dr. Sivanesan will work closely with his mentorship team to develop expertise in cancer-
biology, neuroimmunology, and cancer pain. This training will be accomplished primarily through hands-on
experiments under supervision of his mentors, as well as structured didactic and non-didactic training,
individualized instruction through regular meetings with his mentors, and systematic evaluations. Dr.
Sivanesan will be conducting his research within Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine’s Department of
Anesthesiology, a thriving academic, clinical, and research environment with exceptional facilities for early
stage investigators."
10873237,"In response to PAR-20-056 from the NIDCR to develop and enhance the Dental, Oral and Craniofacial
Research Workforce, a T90/R90 Comprehensive Training Program in Oral Biology is proposed. The proposal
builds on 29 years of experience with highly productive T32 and T90/R90 Training Programs at the University
of Florida College of Dentistry (UFCD) and will provide extensive breadth and depth in training to basic and
clinician scientists in multiple areas that are designated as high priority by the NIDCR. The scientific areas
encompassed in this Comprehensive Training Program in Oral Biology include, but are not limited to, the
Human Microbiome, Oral Infectious Diseases, Mechanistic Connections between Oral and Systemic Health,
Virology, Salivary Gland Biology, Autoimmunity, Bone Biology, Head and Neck Cancers, Computational
Biology, Biomedical Engineering, and Stem Cell Biology. To accomplish our goals, a team of accomplished
basic and clinical researchers has been assembled to provide an extensive set of training experiences in the
biomedical sciences that are directly relevant to oral health and diseases. Well-established interdisciplinary
research training programs in the UFCD and the UF College of Medicine will be utilized, with particular
emphasis on the Interdisciplinary PhD Program in Biomedical Sciences and the UF Clinical and Translational
Science Institute (CTSI). Trainees will include i) 3 traditional PhD students conducting oral health-related
research, ii) 4 dual-degree candidates in our DMD-PhD program, iii) 2 post-doctoral scientists (T90; PhD,
DMD/DDS-PhD, DMD/DDS), and iv) 1 non-citizen, non-permanent resident DMD-PhD holders seeking
advanced post-doctoral training (R90) to prepare them for careers in academic dentistry. In most cases, PhD
and postdoctoral trainees will receive an initial commitment for appointments of three or two years,
respectively, whereas dual-degree students will be supported for the duration of their training. Additional formal
training in Clinical Investigation, Implementation Science or Biomedical Informatics will be available to
individuals supported by the program. The use of combinations of our extensive educational, scientific, and
clinical resources has allowed us to develop highly integrated yet sufficiently flexible training options to meet
the needs of a very diverse group of trainees. Collectively, these programs will produce highly skilled and
interactive scientists who can engage in team science to generate new knowledge and translate discoveries to
tangible advances in the detection, prevention, treatment and cures of diseases and abnormalities of the oral
and craniofacial complex."
10927324,"Therapeutically delaying the progressive decline in cognition in patients with Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) would transform AD into a manageable morbidity, a goal that has not been
achieved using drugs targeted to β-amyloid (Aβ) plaque deposition. Accumulating results
indicate that cognitive loss (linked to circuit / synaptic dysfunction) and β-amyloid (Aβ) plaque
deposition can occur independent of each other, with both driven by a cross-linked soluble
amyloid β-peptide oligomer - neuronal hyperactivity “AD cycle”. Remarkably, the prediction that
cognitive dysfunction can be restored without altering plaque deposition has been confirmed in
several AD models, for example, by drugs that prolong the opening time of the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) ryanodine receptor type 2 (RyR2) calcium channel and suppress neuronal
hyperactivity.
 Conventional biomarkers are unable to interrogate either part of the “AD cycle” in patients at
cellular resolution, an unmet goal for evaluating treatment efficacy at the prodromal stage. Here,
we propose a novel solution to this problem based on the retina, a readily accessible part of the
nervous system with damage similar to that found in the brain of patients with AD. The retina
develops soluble amyloid β-peptide oligomers and plaque deposition before their appearance in
the brain, as well as phosphorylated tau and neurofibrillary tangles. Before overt AD pathology
and cognitive decline are evident, patients report impaired contrast sensitivity (CS), a major risk
factor for falls as well as decreased survival. CS is driven by photoreceptors.
 Our first-in-kind preliminary results in an AD model when there is sparse plaque deposition in
the retina show early impairment of CS, and rod hyperactivity measured using three OCT
mitochondria-driven biomarkers developed in our laboratory. We have also discovered that CS
impairment and rod hyperactivity biomarkers in 5xFAD male C57BL6/J (B6J) mice occur faster
than in 5xFAD male C57BL/6Tac (B6NTac) mice. In WT male B6J mice, rods showed a lower
OCT energy signature than in age-matched WT male B6NTac mice, indicating strain differences
in baseline mitochondria activity.
 We propose to test two working hypotheses with three Specific Aims. First, that impaired CS,
a hyperactive rod energy signature, and/or synaptic dysfunction occur earlier B6J 5xFAD mice
than in B6NTac 5xFAD mice. Second that in 5xFAD mice, RyR2-targeted treatments that delay
cognitive declines mitigate changes in early CS and energy biomarkers, declines in rod synaptic
activity, and later spatial memory deficits but do not change the rate of plaque deposition."
10865032,"Project Summary/Abstract
 There is growing societal and scientific interest in using genomic sequencing (GS) as screening to identify
genetic predispositions for disease early in life to prevent or mitigate future illness. There is, however,
skepticism about the clinical utility of GS in infants and concerns that it could lead to psychosocial harm,
unjustified health expenditures, and unnecessary healthcare utilization, with associated iatrogenic morbidity.
 Over the past five years, within the NIH-funded NSIGHT Consortium, our team launched the “BabySeq
Project,” the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) of GS in newborns. We implemented a clinical workflow for
whole exome sequencing, created criteria for returnable gene/variant selection and interpretation, curated a list
of 1,514 disease-associated genes with favorable validity, age of onset and penetrance; and designed novel
reporting formats. We enrolled and randomized 325 families to a family history (FH) arm or a FH+GS arm,
completed sequencing in the FH+GS arm, disclosed results to families and placed reports in the infants’
medical record. Our results were striking. Medically, we identified and disclosed unanticipated monogenic
disease risks in 11% of infants randomized to GS, and through follow-up testing revealed previously
undiscovered signs of underlying disease and unexplored family history in over half of these. We found no
increased distress or disruption to the parent-child relationship in response to receiving GS results and no
significant increases in downstream healthcare costs. Healthcare providers (HCPs) were able to constructively
manage the information reported. The BabySeq Project created a template for studying the psychological
impact, medical utility, and cost effectiveness of GS in healthy newborns.
 However, our BabySeq population was not diverse and thus our findings not generalizable. In order to
disseminate this technology equitably, it will be crucial to understand its impact on ethnically and racially
diverse populations. The goal of this study is to build on what we learned in BabySeq to study GS as screening
in a population of underserved, primarily African American and Hispanic, infants. We will return pathogenic GS
and copy number variation results and study the impact on families and HCPs, as well as the medical and
economic impact. Through this research we will develop, implement, and evaluate a sustainable approach to
GS as screening that leverages underserved community engagement to minimize distrust and maximize
benefit. This novel study provides a unique opportunity to determine medical, behavioral and economic
outcomes in an under-represented population of infants at three diverse CTSA sites, modeling the vision of GS
as a part of healthcare implemented early in childhood. This project is significant because it proposes to
generate much-needed evidence of the value of GS infants, innovative in its design as the first RCT to explore
the impact of WGS in a diverse population of healthy infants, and feasible because this team of experts has
experience in enrolling participants and the infrastructure to rigorously collect and analyze outcomes."
10879081,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), an inherited retinal degeneration (IRD) disease, is characterized by primary rod
photoreceptor death followed by cone cell death; this results in irreversible vision loss. The rate of cell death in
RP is relatively slow, providing a protracted time window for therapeutic intervention. However,
pharmacological intervention capable of promoting photoreceptor survival remains an unmet need. While many
mouse RP models have been established, accelerating drug discovery by conducting large-scale drug screens
in mice is impractical. Zebrafish, however, are an established system for modeling human disease and testing
therapeutic compounds. In particular, our previous studies have shown zebrafish are especially valuable for
large-scale phenotypic drug screens. Thus, we generated genetic zebrafish RP models by knocking out RP
associated genes (e.g. rho, pde6a, and pde6b) with fluorescently labeled rod photoreceptors for easy
phenotype monitoring. We identified five models which exhibit various rates and severity of rod cell loss, a key
feature of RP. In addition, while the disease etiology is unclear, our preliminary data and recent studies
suggest that poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) signaling, a key regulator of the parthanatos cell death
pathway, plays a significant role. Therefore, we propose to utilize new zebrafish RP models to investigate
photoreceptor cell death mechanism(s), and perform an in vivo phenotypic drug re-purposing screen
to identify small molecules that preserve degenerating photoreceptors. In Aim 1, we will measure cellular
changes and rod photoreceptor degeneration in the new RP models. In addition, we will evaluate the effect of
suppressing poly-PARP signaling, a hall mark of PARP1 activation, to determine if photoreceptor degeneration
is ameliorated. This will be accomplished using PARP inhibitors and knocking out PARP1. We will assess how
the extent of rod degeneration affects visual function by conducting visual behavior assays with the new RP
models. In Aim 2, we will use a phenotypic drug screening platform we developed to identify compounds
promoting rod photoreceptors survival in our RP models. We previously screened ~3,000 drugs in over
350,000 zebrafish larvae with inducible rod degeneration and successfully identified retinal neuroprotectants
showing efficacy in both fish and mouse models. Here, we will screen ~200 hit drugs, mostly human-approved,
from that project. In Aim 3, we will validate the identified neuroprotectants in three RP genetic mouse models.
This cross-species drug discover approach will accelerate the translation of identified drug for clinical trial, an
approach which can applied to a number of degenerative disease models. Therefore, completion of this project
will provide insight into the molecular basis of RP pathogenesis and identify compounds for RP clinical trials."
10834250,"Our goal is to develop small-molecule drugs for treatment of skeletal muscle disorders related to
dysregulation of intracellular calcium, focusing on specific proteins in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR).
Each Aim starts with the design of fluorescent biosensors (specific SR proteins labeled with fluorescent donor
and acceptor), to be used in high-throughput screening (HTS) of small molecules. A key innovation is our recently
developed HTS approach based on fluorescence lifetime (FLT) detection of protein structural changes by
fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Our combination of FRET biosensor engineering with
unique FLT detection has produced an unprecedented combination of sensitivity, specificity, speed, and
precision in protein structure-based studies of mechanism for drug discovery. We previously validated this
approach through applications to cardiac muscle. We now focus on skeletal muscle, targeting the two key SR
proteins involved in Ca regulation, the Ca release channel (RyR1) and the calcium pump (SERCA1a).
Aim 1: Targeting RyR1 leak reduction. Our biosensor is based on FRET between two regulatory proteins
(FKBP12.0 and CaM) bound to RyR1. In pilot screens, we have shown that this FLT-based FRET assay can
detect small molecules that restore aberrant RyR1 function, in which the Ca channel leaks Ca from the SR into
the cytoplasm, inducing myopathies. We will carry out larger-scale screening, to identify new drug candidates,
then use cellular and in vivo muscle assays to test the reversal of undesirable calcium leak in fibers and mice.
Aim2: Targeting SERCA1a activation. We seek a complementary solution to combat Ca leak – enhancing
SERCA1a activity to pump Ca back into the SR lumen. This approach also targets factors (e.g., mutation or
oxidation) that impair SERCA1a activity. We will use two complementary approaches, building on our previous
studies with SERCA2a (cardiac), with fluorescent biosensors expressed in live cells. (A) We will use an
intramolecular FRET biosensor (donor and acceptor attached to different domains of SERCA1a), to screen a
small-molecule library to detect compounds that bind to SERCA, alter enzyme structure, and activate Ca
transport. (B) We will use an intermolecular biosensor, with donor on SERCA1a and acceptor on the SERCA1a
regulator sarcolipin (SLN), to detect compounds that activate the enzyme by uncoupling the inhibitory effects of
SLN. We will evaluate potency and efficacy of drug candidates, using assays on myofibers and muscles, both in
vitro and in vivo in mouse models including pre-clinical longitudinal drug testing.
 We have assembled a multi-PI team with complementary expertise and decades of successful collaboration,
led by David Thomas (SERCA1a, FLT-FRET), Razvan Cornea (RyR1, biosensor engineering), and Dawn Lowe
(skeletal muscle functional analysis). We will also be joined by collaborators with complementary expertise in
medicinal chemistry (Aldrich) and myofiber Ca assays (Launikonis), and two consultants with unique expertise
on animal models of disorders in muscle Ca regulation (Dirksen and Hamilton)."
10911816,"The overarching goal of this SEPA R25 project is to increase rural student interest in pursuing a career in
the health care professions, and in so doing help address the higher morbidity and mortality in rural
communities associated with the shortage of health care professionals. To accomplish this we will
develop and implement a transformative educational program for rural 9th-12th grade students, Building
Rural Aspirations In Neuroscience with Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (BRAIN-
STEM) that will use research-based strategies to address the key modifiable barriers that limit rural
student interest in and the ability to succeed in health care careers. Namely, BRAIN-STEM will (1)
Improve academic, research, and metacognitive skills important in succeeding in the STEM subjects
relevant to health care profession training, and thereby increase students’ perceived self-efficacy in
pursuing these careers, (2) provide role models and mentors for students, and (3) ignite high school
student interest in the health care professions. These aims will be accomplished through 5-day summer
camps and afterschool programs. The summer camp is designed to spark student interest in the health care
professions and introduce academic, research and metacognitive skills development. These topics will be
covered in more depth during the afterschool program. Both the summer camp and afterschool program
curricula will include a combination of established (e.g., inquiry-based learning) and innovative (e.g.,
metacognitive skill development) pedagogical techniques that will conform to the NGSS standards.
Importantly, the BRAIN-STEM curriculum will be developed in close collaboration with our teacher
partners. BRAIN-STEM participants will work extensively with Clarkson Faculty and near-peer students,
who will serve as mentors and role models. These mentors and role models along with our teacher
partners will be trained in professional development workshops that will enable them to guide students
through the research process; develop academic, research and metacognitive skills; teach the process of
evidence-based medicine; and provide encouragement to pursue healthcare-related careers. To ignite
student interest in the health care professions BRAIN-STEM will have students work on two brain-related
clinical problems that are personally relevant, important, and have local significance: addiction and
concussion. Finally, all curriculum and best practices will be broadly disseminated through a state-of the
art web application, open-source lesson plans, journal publications, conference presentations, and a broad
range of other delivery mechanisms (subsequent camps, academic year enrichment class, and integrated
into other outreach programs). BRAIN-STEM will accomplish all of this by leveraging Clarkson
University’s faculty expertise and strong partnerships with surrounding school districts and health care
professionals."
10897820,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The proposed Genetics Training Program (UGTP) at the University of Utah (UofU) will provide in-depth training
in Genetics for a diverse group of 12 predoctoral students, arming them with scientific and professional
knowledge and skills needed to conduct independent and rigorous research and become leaders within the
biomedical research workforce. The U of U has a well-established, successful graduate training effort in
genetics research, including a long-running Genetics T32 (45 years). The proposed new UGTP is an intensive
two-year program of training in quantitative analysis, rigorous and transparent experimental practices,
professional skills, the ethical practice of science, mentorship, and equity/inclusivity. These foundational
objectives support the development of future multi-dimensional leaders and mentors in genetics research.
The UGTP engages trainees at a formative stage of their career, in their 2nd and 3rd years of graduate school.
Benefits of the program extend both before and after the intensive two-year training period. Completion of a
pre-requisite first year graduate curriculum covering basic transmission genetics, ethical practices in research,
critical thinking, hypothesis development, and understanding of rigor and reproducibility is required for the
UGTP. Students who successfully pass a Capstone Exam administered at the end of Year 1, assessing trainee
potential for independent research and rigor in scientific analysis and experimental thinking, are eligible for the
UGTP. Each year about 12% of the approximately 50 TGE students are selected to become trainees.
Trainees convene year-round in a suite of enriching activities. The central feature of the Training Program is a
seminar course led by the PDs, limited to trainees, in which the students i) present research, critically evaluate
progress, and discuss scientific best practices; undertake continued training in ii) RCR and iii) rigor,
transparency, and reproducibility; participate in workshops on iv) professional development, v) mentoring; and
vi) recognizing and responding to biased behaviors. Trainees present their research progress annually before
the entire UofU Genetics community and select and host visiting genetics speakers throughout the year. Three
advanced courses in quantitative and genetics analyses provide a breadth of training in the field of Genetics.
The UGTP provides continuous mentorship in research and professional development: trainees develop IDPs
with the Program Directors, adopt an extra mentor from the UGTP Steering Committee who provides guidance
and communication with the UGTP, and participate in events aimed at career development and building an
inclusive community. Following two years of UGTP-supported research with one of 61 UGTP faculty, trainees
remain engaged through a novel initiative of near-peer mentorship, a program feature that supports the
scientific and cultural development and mentoring skills of our trainees. The UGTP engages the entire UofU
genetics community year-round through external speakers, Concepts in Genetics Seminars, and an Annual
Retreat featuring trainee talks, plenary speakers, and poster presentations from the UofU genetics community."
10886086,"Project Summary
 Multiple genetic risks cause alcohol, nicotine and cannabis substance use (SU) and substance use disorders
(SUDs). However, genetic studies alone cannot explain the cascade of molecular changes between SNPs and
SU and SUDs. Nor can current approaches correctly measure the causal impact of genetic differences on
parental and home environments linked to SU and SUDs. Molecular studies that link GWAS results to gene
expression data via eQTL findings have increased our understanding of the etiology of SU and SUDs. Yet, they
fail to capture complex gene interactions that are the hallmark of complex traits including SU and SUDs, or are
mostly underpowered (especially from brain tissues). Another limitation is that genetic and molecular studies
neglect environmental confounding. We know that parents create and influence children’s environments and that
certain parental and home environments are more associated with SU and SUDs. Not only do genetic risks vary
with environments, but environments themselves are also heritable, and are thus confounded by parental
genetics. We and others argue that unconfounding the impact of parent-to-offspring molecular genetics on SU
and SUDs from the parental and home environments is the central task of genetics. Here, we rely on recent
methodological advances to address these limitations. First, we have developed a novel and proven method of
measuring the impact of untransmitted parental genomes. This method identifies the indirect impact of
untransmitted parental genomes on complex behaviours. A significant impact of untransmitted genomes is
evidence of genetically nurtured environments that are unconfounded by the direct parent-to-offspring genetics.
Second, we can now perform gene expression (GE) imputation using existing GWAS. We can, therefore,
estimate heritable, genome-wide individual differences in imputed GE networks in very large samples. This
substantially increases our power to identify molecular pathways underlying SU and SUD aetiology. In summary,
we are proposing to i) use existing GWAS data from large population-based family samples, ii) apply our method
of assembling untransmitted parental genomes, iii) impute parentally transmitted and untransmitted GE, iv) apply
network analyses to identify transmitted and untransmitted GE networks that are associated with SU and SUDs,
and v) identify parental and home environments mediating these networks. This will enable us to identify the GE
networks involved in SU and SUDs while identifying risky and protective parental and home environments that
are genetically ‘nurtured’ within a unified theoretical framework."
10885124,"Project Summary/Abstract (Core A, Portnoy)
The purpose of Core A is to ensure scientific progress and promote synergy by providing effective scientific
and administrative leadership and financial oversight to the program. These objectives will be accomplished
by extensive review of scientific progress at monthly meetings attended by all projects and cores within the
program and affiliated lab groups from around the Bay Area; smaller meetings held by subgroups; and
shared interviews of potential postdoctoral fellows. Scientific direction and research results will be subject to
intensive, constructive criticism by investigators within the P01 and by regular evaluations from an external
scientific advisory board. We strongly believe that our extensive collaborative approach promoted by Core A
is unique. Indeed, this program represents the nucleating group for Bay Area investigators studying
intracellular pathogens and innate immunity. The Specific Aims are: 1) Conduct management of scientific
progress; 2) Establish and engage external advisory board to review scientific progress; and 3) Implement
financial management and administrative support. To facilitate interactions among investigators, two-hour
joint lab meetings will continue to be held monthly at UC Berkeley. These monthly meetings consist of
introductory discussions and two scientific presentations from two different labs. Given possible restrictions
related to the coronavirus, we will use teleconferencing options for meetings, if necessary.
The external scientific advisory board, chaired by Dr. Jeffrey F. Miller from UCLA, will provide rigorous and
consistent evaluation of the program’s scientific direction, research results, and progress. Core A will
facilitate the relationship between the external board and the investigators as well as among the Project
Leaders themselves, who will meet once per month for 2 hours in the Program Director’s office. The Portnoy,
Vance, Cox, and Stanley labs each have a weekly lab meeting to review ongoing research in their respective
labs. In addition to the monthly meetings of P01 personnel and other Bay Area labs, there are many other
opportunities for investigators and trainees to interact, exchange ideas, and speak, including a weekly
Division of Immunology & Pathogenesis “Research in Progress” meeting on Mondays at noon with 2
speakers from 2 different labs; a seminar series from the Infectious Diseases & Vaccinology Group on
Mondays at 10 am, most speakers being from local labs; and the Microbial Biology Seminar Series, held on
Wednesdays at noon, with speakers from the US and across the world. Finally, we have an annual
immunology retreat at Asilomar that is held jointly with UCSF. Core A serves as the administrative nucleus
for the P01 and has been a critical element to our success."

Despite recent emphasis on the microbiome, there are few skin microbiome studies in infants; even fewer have
been performed in preterm infants. Currently, there is a significant gap in our knowledge of the normal evolution
of the preterm infant skin microbiome from birth to an independent, site-specific cutaneous microbiome.
Preliminary studies show that preterm infants have limited microbial diversity and different predominant
cutaneous microbes compared to full-term infants. This lack of a robust, diverse skin microbiome may render
preterm infants susceptible to pathogenic skin bacteria that cause disease, particularly neonatal sepsis. The
research goals of this mentored career-development award are to: 1) characterize the establishment of the
neonatal skin microbiome in a cohort of preterm infants from birth to 4 weeks and compare to demographic and
clinical variables, 2) recruit a cohort of term infants to determine if the preterm infant skin microbiome is
significantly different than term infants, and 3) analyze cultured pathogens with the skin microbiome in late-onset
neonatal sepsis (LOS). Our methods represent a departure from the currently available studies, which provide
opportunistic sampling of the neonatal skin microbiome rather than sampling at defined timepoints. This study will
vertically-advance the field by sampling the preterm skin microbiome systematically after birth. The role of the
skin microbiome in neonatal sepsis has also not been described, and the design of this study will provide a better
understanding of changes in the skin microbiome before late onset sepsis. Together, these aims will provide
insight into the normal and abnormal development of the preterm infant skin microbiome. Future studies will then
leverage the neonatal skin microbiome via therapeutic and preventative strategies to lower the incidence of LOS.
This K23 is the next logical step in the training program started under my KL2 award, and the final step in my
transition to an independent physician scientist. This proposal describes mentored research and training activities
designed to launch a novel neonatal skin microbiome research program, the first in the field of pediatric
dermatology. Five training and career development goals, facilitated by my mentoring team, are required to
accomplish this. These include: extend my understanding of research design, deepen my knowledge of
microbiome and relevant laboratory science, gain working knowledge of statistics/bioinformatics (including
advanced metagenomic analyses), learn to lead an independent laboratory, and expand my professional network
within microbiome science. The University of Florida provides a rich environment with expertise in the neonatal
microbiome and metagenomics, ideal to extend my previous work as I develop a novel neonatal skin microbiome
research program. The resources at UF will be augmented by additional skin microbiome expertise and
laboratory resources from Dr. Pammi at Baylor College of Medicine and Diversigen Inc."

Though cardiovascular disease (CVD) management has advanced, CVD remains the leading cause of
premature death worldwide. As age remains the dominant factor in CVD risk and the population ages, the
poorly understood age-related factors promoting CVD risk require urgent investigation. This proposal uses
functional human genomic and multi-omics modifier analyses with the human specimen to investigate the
mechanistic links between clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) and CVD toward improving
clinical management. CHIP is common in elders (≥1 in 10 among >70 years), and recent data establish
coronary artery disease (CAD), a primary cause of CVD, as the primary cause of the increased mortality in
those with CHIP. With the discovery in N~37K and replication in N~5K, preliminary data show that SNPs on
chromosome 10q23.32 increase the CAD hazard among those with CHIP 10-fold but are not associated with
CAD among those without CHIP. Downstream analyses showed the potential role of CPEB3, which modulates
the IL-6 signaling pathway, in line with the previous studies showing the importance of the IL-6 pathway for
CAD development in CHIP carriers. However, the exact mechanisms are yet to be elucidated. Further genomic
and functional molecular analyses would identify novel CHIP-specific mechanisms in CAD pathogenesis and
lead to CAD prevention strategies among CHIP carriers with the most robust preclinical evidence in humans.
The aims of this proposal will: discover the further germline genetic predisposition that induces CHIP-related
CVD with an increased sample size (~575K: >10-fold from the preliminary study) to construct CHIP specific
polygenic interaction risk score (PIRS) for CAD, which stratifies the risk of CVD in CHIP carriers (Aim 1 and 3),
prioritize causal mechanisms for CHIP-related CAD with the integration of genomic data and multi-omics data
(Aim 2), and dissect the molecular mechanisms for CHIP-related CAD combining population genetics and
analyses of human specimens (Aim4). Successful completion of the aims will pave the way for cardiovascular
risk management of CHIP carriers by (i) improving risk stratification and (ii) improving our understanding of the
causal underpinnings of CAD and CHIP.
Through this award period, PI will receive invaluable guidance from mentors and advisory board members, the
world leaders in these fields, and also take rich didactic courses provided by the world-class environment of
Harvard, MIT, and Broad Institute to gain new knowledge and skills to be a competitive independent
investigator, which will be directly implemented to this study. The PI will gain extensive experience in
translational research of cardiovascular medicine under the mentorship of Dr. Natarajan, a world-class leader
in the genomics of cardiovascular medicine and a member of Harvard Medical School. Furthermore, this
research will provide vital career guidance on the PI’s path to becoming an independent investigator."

Gaining genetic access to specific cell types in rodents, non-human primates and other vertebrate species is
critical for enabling targeted circuit manipulations to understand normal brain function and brain. The use of
gene regulatory elements for targeted gene expression is transforming brain circuitry studies. In response to
RFA-MH-21-180, the Center for Neural Circuit Mapping (CNCM) team led by Dr. Xiangmin Xu at the Minority
Serving Institution (MSI)-designated institution, University of California, Irvine (UCI) will collaborate with Dr.
Gordon Fishell’s team at Harvard University and the Broad Institute to produce and distribute reagents developed
by their Armamentarium project, “Systematic identification of enhancers to target the breadth of excitatory and
inhibitory neuronal cell types in the cerebral cortex” (U01MH13070, pending award). Dr. Fishell’s team has
established a novel high-throughput enhancer screening platform using gene regulatory elements that enables
cell type-restricted gene expression in cortical GABAergic interneuron and pyramidal excitatory neuron subtypes
at an unprecedented resolution. This is achieved using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors for the effective
screening and validation of enhancers for specific neuron types in the mouse, non-human primate, and human
brain. The first goal of our proposed research is to establish close collaborations between the UCI and Harvard
University/Broad Institute teams to scale up and optimize the production of cell-type-specific enhancer-AAVs.
Using our growing Center platform, the UCI team will distribute these viral reagents to qualified investigators in
the neuroscience community for cell-type-specific access and manipulation. The second goal of our research is
to enhance the impact of this project by engaging scientists and students from diverse backgrounds and less
research-intensive institutions that serve minority communities. In Aim 1, the UCI team will form a partnership
with Dr. Fishell’s team to expand seed enhancer-AAV reagents characterized by Dr. Fishell’s team to make a
broad set of tools for cell-type-specific neural circuit studies across vertebrate species. We will leverage our
CNCM existing expertise in neurotropic virus production and distribution to make new helper AAVs based on Dr.
Fishell’s enhancers to improve the precision of genetically targeted specific circuit mapping in the CNS. In Aims
2 and 3, we will coordinate with Dr. Fishell’s pilot U01 project investigators to scale up our UCI CNCM viral
production pipeline and improve our distribution platform to support viral reagent production, validation, and
ample supplies for research community distribution. We will expand our recruitment of team members from
diverse backgrounds facilitated by partnering with Western University of Health Sciences and Morehouse School
of Medicine to include faculty, staff and students of underrepresented minorities for the proposed research. We
will fulfill the RFA requirement to generate and distribute authenticated viral reagents in a well-regulated manner
to be widely used in the research community. This U24 award will provide critical support for the BRAIN-Initiative
Armamentarium project."
10895502,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall objective of my research program is to define fluid as an integral component of the cellular
microenvironment and to better understand how movement of fluid in the microenvironment impacts cell and
tissue processes. My laboratory employs a multidisciplinary approach merging microfabrication techniques and
microfluidic devices, computational fluid dynamics, and cellular and molecular biology to define the mechanisms
by which cells sense and respond to fluid flow. We are specifically interested in how forces from moving fluids
impact cell adhesion and effector signaling, and to further our overall goals, we have identified three specific
interests: (1) resolving the forces that moving fluids impart on cells, (2) identifying the molecular machinery that
transduces these forces into biological responses, and (3) determining how molecular scale transduction is
coordinated into a tissue scale response. While my training focused on understanding fluid flow and transport in
cancer and the vasculature, my independent research laboratory seeks to focus on tissues and processes in
which the effects of fluid transport are not as well defined, with an emphasis on development and morphogenesis.
In line with these objectives, over the next five years, the specific goals of my research laboratory are to: (1)
engineer cell surface receptors to better understand how the highly conserved Notch family receptors sense fluid
flow, (2) map forces and cellular responses to flow through porous media by developing novel, integrated
microfluidic and computational approaches, (3) develop a new class of microfluidic devices to recapitulate the
native microenvironment using human-derived cells and matrix. The results of this research and the integration
of the enabling technologies will contribute to the overall objectives of my research program of defining the scope
and general principles of fluid forces in the cellular microenvironment, illuminating the mechanisms by which

HIV assaults deep tissues including the gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) tract within days after
transmission to a new person. It then quickly and irreversibly changes the local immune environment and
establishes a reservoir in resident cells. Our current understanding of the different mechanisms that allow HIV
persistence in GI, GU, and adipose tissues and of how the local immune environment impacts HIV reservoir
persistence and dynamics remains superficial, however. The rationale for this project is that understanding these
processes will be important for HIV cure efforts, which have until recently largely ignored non-blood reservoirs,
and to improve the health of persons with HIV (PWH) as they age.
In response to RFA DK-20-023, we built a team led by Drs. Smith and Rivera-Nieves (Co-PIs with complementary
expertise in virology, gastroenterology and mucosal immunology) with the objective to precisely define the
contributions of various viral and host mechanisms of HIV reservoir renewal and persistence across NIDDK
targeted tissues and blood, using the novel Last Gift rapid autopsy cohort.
Our overall hypothesis is that HIV reservoirs persist in NIDDK targeted tissues and are differentially renewed by
various cellular and viral mechanisms.
To address these open questions, our study will collect and analyze NIDDK targeted tissues throughout the
human GI and GU tracts and intra-abdominal and subcutaneous adipose tissue of altruistic PWH enrolled in the
Last Gift cohort, an ongoing rapid autopsy study. Immune cells collected from these individuals before death will
also be analyzed, in parallel, in order to facilitate comparison with prior work. Some participants (n=15) will
remain virally suppressed until the time of death, while others (n=5) will choose to stop their antiretroviral (ARV)
treatment before death.
The proposed research is innovative because we propose to map HIV burden and activity in tissues with different
immune and ARV environments (Aim 1), to determine the role of clonal expansion as a driver of HIV persistence
during treatment and viral rebound after treatment interruption (Aim 2) and to develop an integrative/innovative
phylogeographic Bayesian approach to jointly analyze virological and immunological data to unravel viral
dispersal and reseeding across the body in relation to local environments. By analyzing these connections, we
expect to reveal pathways and interactions that may differentially impact HIV associated inflammation.
We believe our proposed study to be significant because this is a unique opportunity to provide new insights into
the mechanisms of HIV persistence. Such findings would be important for the development of strategies aimed
to thwart local HIV-associated inflammation, which is associated with HIV pathogenesis in the gut, genital tract
and adipose tissues."

 Oxidative stress plays a crucial role in Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Importantly, oxidative stress is more prominent
in primary and secondary progressive MS (PP/SPMS) than in the relapsing remitting (RRMS) form, and
alternative treatment strategies targeting oxidative stress are being tested for PP/SPMS. Unfortunately, there
are presently limited in vivo methods for measuring oxidative stress. Hyperpolarized 13C Magnetic Resonance
Spectroscopic Imaging (HP 13C MRSI) is a safe method that detects metabolic reactions in vivo post injection of
HP probes. HP [1-13C]-dehydroxyascorbate (DHA) has shown potential for in vivo imaging of oxidative stress in
vivo, but causes transient respiratory arrest and pancreatic toxicity, limiting its translational potential. There is
thus a need for a new imaging strategy to assess oxidative stress in the brain in vivo.
 N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is the N-acetyl derivative of the naturally occurring amino acid, L-cysteine, and has
been used as an antioxidant in clinical practice for decades. In people living with MS, a recent study reported
that NAC significantly increased cerebral glucose metabolism and cognitive function, identifying NAC as a
potential therapy. Based on all these findings, we propose to:
 Aim 1: Optimize and validate HP [1,4-13C]NAC as a theranostic probe to non-invasively detect cerebral
redox status in MS mice at clinical field strength: The concentration of [1,4-13C]NAC and the MRSI acquisition
scheme will be optimized for detection of the metabolism of [1,4-13C]NAC in the brain of MS mice, to provide the
best data quality. Correlations between ex vivo oxidative stress markers and in vivo HP Ac/Cys-to-NAC will be
performed to biologically validate our imaging method. Completion of this aim will provide an optimized tool for
quantifying in vivo redox state in the MS mouse brain.
 Aim 2. Apply theranostic metabolic imaging of oxidative stress to monitor response to therapies: We
will apply a multimodal metabolic imaging approach combining both HP [1,4-13C]NAC and HP [1-13C]DHA
strategies, as well as complementary biological assays, to investigate the effects of a clinically-relevant therapy
dimethylfumarate (DMF), a novel potential therapeutic molecule affecting oxidative stress (Acivicin) as well as
the effect of NAC itself used as treatment, in a preclinical model of MS. Correlations between ex vivo oxidative
stress markers and in vivo HP ratios will be performed to biologically validate our imaging approaches, and
compare HP [1,4-13C]NAC and HP [1-13C]DHA strategies. Completion of this aim will validate a new metabolic
imaging tool for monitoring therapeutic response linked to changes in oxidative stress in MS in vivo.
 Overall Impact: The expected overall impact is that, through validation of a new theranostic MR imaging
approach allowing for assessment of oxidative stress, and upon clinical translation, results from this project will
likely improve the clinical management for MS patients – especially for the SPMS/PPMS population in high need
of improved care -, help refine therapy regimens and, ultimately lead to better outcome and patient quality of life."
10918034,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Diabetes is a common chronic condition among U.S. adults, affecting an estimated 34.1 million adults; it also
disproportionately affects those of lower socio-economic status. Diabetes management is complex, involving
lifestyle changes (i.e., physical activity and dietary changes), weight management, glucose level monitoring,
the use of oral medications or insulin, and regular medical care visits. Unfortunately, poor treatment adherence
increases the risk for diabetes related complications (e.g., chronic kidney disease, vision loss, heart disease,
and nerve damage) and mortality. The workplace is a critical context that can influence disease management,
and work can interfere with health management in workers with chronic conditions. Blue-collar and service
sector workers are likely at greater risk, given their relative lack of flexibility at work compared to white-collar
workers. Our long-term goal is to develop and assess an intervention to address work-related factors that lead
to low work ability, and poor self-management in blue-collar and service workers with diabetes, as such
interventions are currently lacking. In this current R03 study, we assess work-related predictors of diabetes
self-management and work ability in U.S. blue-collar and service sector workers with diabetes; results will
inform future interventions. This R03 study is a mixed methods study, in which we will first interview 25 blue-
collar and service workers with type 2 diabetes to get their perceptions of what they need at work to maintain
their work ability and manage their diabetes alongside work. This qualitative data will allow us to check some of
our propositions from theory, revise the model, and/or add variables that we did not initially propose. Then, we
will validate the resulting model using quantitative survey data from 270 workers with diabetes at two time
points, and finish with interviews with 5 workers with diabetes to check survey study results. The model will
include work-related predictors (organizational support, supervisor support, health-supportive supervisor
behaviors, job control, various forms of flexibility), individual predictors (habit strength, diabetes management
self-efficacy, and disease burden), and work ability and diabetes self-management (unintentional medication
non-adherence, glucose monitoring, physical activity, dietary management, and medical appointments) as
outcomes. Results will include identifying the most important predictors of self-management and work ability
through relative importance analysis. This work supports NIOSH’s Total Worker Health® (TWH) mission,
NIOSH’s strategic goal 7 and strategic goals of the Healthy Work Design and Well-Being cross-sector program
to promote safe and healthy work design and well-being in vulnerable workers. Scientific outputs will include
presentations and peer-reviewed journal articles that present study results. In terms of Research to Practice
(R2P), these data will provide necessary information prior to developing and evaluating an organizational
intervention to support workers with diabetes, which we plan to do in a future R01 proposal. Through these
outputs, this study will address a critical unmet need in the U.S. workforce."
10767364,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) processed from virus-produced double-stranded RNA
(dsRNA) mediate potent antiviral immunity, often termed as antiviral RNA interference (RNAi), in
fungi, plants and invertebrates. Antiviral RNAi is often initiated by dicer proteins which chop viral
dsRNAs into siRNAs. Argonaut (AGO) proteins recruit dicer-produced siRNAs and use them as
sequence guide to identify and destroy viral RNA transcripts with matching sequence. The destruction
of target viral transcripts is mediated by the slicer activity of AGO proteins. dsRNA binding proteins
(DRBPs) also contribute to antiviral RNAi by facilitating siRNA production or loading into AGO
proteins.
 Currently, whether RNAi mediates antiviral immunity in mammals under physiological
conditions is still under hot debate. Although the antiviral activity of mammalian RNAi is active in
non-differentiated stem cells and newborn mice it becomes undetectable in differentiated cells and
fully developed mice. The fact that both dicer and the AGO protein required for siRNA production
remain functionally active in differentiated cells suggest that there is a regulatory mechanism that
actively suppresses the antiviral activity of mammalian RNAi in differentiated cells. Currently, how
this regulatory mechanism works remains largely unknown. Since key mammalian RNAi genes, such
as those encoding dicer and Ago2, are required for the biogenesis or function of miRNAs, which
regulate essential cell differentiation and division, it is impossible to knock out these genes to study the
antiviral function of mammalian RNAi without causing cell growth arrest or lethality.
 By co-delivery of human dicer and Ago2, one of the human Ago proteins with slicer activity,
the PI’s lab successfully reconstituted human antiviral RNAi in C. elegans. Importantly, the antiviral
activity is further enhanced in the presence of a human TRBP transgene but appears to be suppressed
in the presence of a human PACT transgene. Both TRBP and PACT are dsRNA-binding proteins
sharing similar domain structure. Previous in vitro studies have demonstrated that whereas TRBP
facilitates the processing of dsRNA by dicer PACT seems to inhibit dicer processing of dsRNA. These
observations together with our finding suggest that TRBP and PACT conversely regulate the antiviral
activity of mammalian RNAi and PACT may dominate the regulation, leading to suppressed antiviral
activity under physiological conditions. Here we propose to study the negative regulation of human
antiviral RNAi by PACT in C. elegans. Findings from the proposed research may not only allow us to
gain insight into the mechanism by which mammalian antiviral RNAi is regulated in differentiated
cells but also facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies for viral infection prevention."
10895349,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most prevalent form of cancer in the US and the second leading cause of
cancer deaths. Studies over the last several decades have revealed that the gut microbiota influences CRC, and
recent work has implicated gut bacterial genotoxins as key effectors in cancer development and progression.
One of the bacterial genotoxins most strongly connected to cancer is colibactin, a metabolite produced by human
gut commensal bacteria, including certain E. coli strains, that possess a biosynthetic gene cluster termed the
pks island. The increased prevalence of pks+ E. coli in CRC patients and the ability of pks+ strains to potentiate
tumorigenesis in mouse models of CRC suggest colibactin may play a causal role in cancer progression.
However, achieving a mechanistic understanding of colibactin's genotoxicity and contribution to CRC has been
impeded by an inability to isolate and structurally characterize the active genotoxic metabolite(s). During the
previous funding period of this grant, we gained critical information about colibactin's structure and mode of
action by studying the enzymes involved in its biosynthesis. Most notably, we established that colibactin is a
DNA alkylating agent and proposed a potential structure for the active genotoxin. The overall objective of this
renewal application is to elucidate additional molecular mechanisms underlying colibactin's activity and role in
CRC carcinogenesis. Building off of the central hypothesis that the genotoxic activity of colibactin derives from
the formation of DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs), our three specific aims will: 1) characterize the specificity
and structure of colibactin-DNA ICLs; 2) develop small molecules that inhibit colibactin biosynthesis in microbial
communities; 3) elucidate the physiological location and timing of colibactin-mediated DNA damage in CRC
development. These advances will be enabled by our multidisciplinary approach, which merges knowledge and
techniques from chemical biology, structural biology, microbiology, toxicology, and cancer biology. Overall, this
effort will fill critical gaps in fundamental knowledge needed to elucidate the role of colibactin-producing gut
bacteria in CRC carcinogenesis and ultimately impact cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Additionally,
by successfully demonstrating that studying and manipulating individual disease-associated microbial pathways
can provide key mechanistic insights, this work will also support and validate future efforts to understand how
other gut microbial activities influence CRC initiation and development."
10891601,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This R01 application, led by an Early Stage Investigator, aims to test the effectiveness of a multilevel community-
based intervention to increase uptake and adherence to oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among adolescent
girls and young women (AGYW) in Kenya. AGYW in this setting live in a context of heightened gender inequality
and risk of intimate partner violence (IPV) and represent a large subpopulation who are uniquely vulnerable to HIV
infection. In addition to having higher HIV incidence, women experiencing IPV are less likely to initiate and persist
with PrEP, limiting the protective benefit of this efficacious biomedical prevention intervention. Barriers to PrEP
uptake and adherence occur at multiple levels of the socioecological model, including low individual self-efficacy,
partner opposition, and community stigma. Tu'Washindi na PrEP (We are Winners with PrEP) is a multi-level,
community-based intervention designed specifically to address these challenges among AGYW in Siaya County,
Kenya. Designed by our team using participatory methods engaging local AGYW (R34 MH114519), the intervention
includes three components delivered over 6 months: an eight-session, empowerment-based support club for AGYW,
community sensitization targeted toward male partners, and PrEP education events for couples. Activities are designed
to be integrated into youth-focused programming to ensure efficiency and sustainability. Results from a pilot cluster-
randomized controlled trial conducted with 100 AGYW at six sites indicate high feasibility and acceptability, and
preliminary effectiveness: intervention arm participants had 2-fold higher PrEP uptake and adherence (p<0.05), with
less frequent or severe IPV than control arm participants. The proposed study builds on these promising results and
aims to evaluate the intervention in a fully powered cluster-randomized controlled trial across 22 administrative wards
in Siaya County, Kenya, enrolling 72 AGYW per ward (total N=1,584). The primary objectives (Aim 1) will be to test
the effectiveness of the intervention on PrEP uptake and adherence immediately post-delivery (month 6 post-
enrollment) and 6 months later (month 12). As secondary objectives we will test the intervention effect on IPV and
relationship power (Aim 2). A rigorous process evaluation will explore mechanisms of change, contextual factors, and
implementation considerations to inform future refinement and scale-up, using programmatic data, participant
questionnaires, and qualitative interviews with participants and providers (Aim 3). The proposed study builds directly
on our R34 intervention development work to develop the evidence base for this youth-designed, multi-level HIV
prevention intervention. If effective, Tu'Washindi will be ideally positioned for sustainable integration into existing
youth-focused programming to expand and support PrEP use in this priority population."

Many monogenic diseases strike prior to or soon after birth and cause significant morbidity and mortality. In utero

cells, and immature immune system, to safely and efficiently institute the genome editing therapeutic prior to the
onset of pathology. To fully understand the potential of IUGE and in preparation for IND applications, rigorous
small and large animal studies are required to assess efficacy as well as fetal and maternal safety. The In

Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding
phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), resulting in the accumulation of phenylalanine (Phe) to neurotoxic levels.
Among the five most frequently occurring pathogenic PAH variants worldwide is the c.842C>T (P281L) mutation,
which is amenable to adenine base editing. The current treatment options have significant limitations—a strict
low-Phe diet to which many patients find it difficult to adhere, and a daily injectable enzyme therapy with a
substantial risk of anaphylaxis. Lead Project 1 will focus on a lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-based adenine base
editing treatment for PKU in patients with the P281L variant, with the aim to file an IND application by the end
of the five-year funding period and begin a phase 1/2 clinical trial soon afterwards."

T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematopoietic malignancy in children and young
adults that frequently becomes treatment-refractory and relapses. Although cure rates have improved with
intensified multi-agent chemotherapy, relapsed or treatment refractory disease remains very difficult to treat.
Therefore, there is a great medical need for identifying novel vulnerabilities and therapeutic approaches.
Targeting of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment has led to promising results in many solid tumors.
Yet, comprehensive studies of the T-ALL microenvironment, which are necessary to characterize
leukemia/immune cell interactions and identify therapeutic vulnerabilities, have not been performed. Using single
cell sequencing technologies of T-ALL blasts and their microenvironmental cells, we have generated preliminary
data suggesting a novel role of immune evasion in T-ALL with the potential to incorporate immunotherapy
approaches into current treatment regimens to overcome T-cell exhaustion. This proposal seeks to define novel
mechanisms of immune evasion in T-ALL and develop means for their therapeutic targeting. We will define
mechanisms of CD8+ T-cell dysfunction by combining RNA-Seq, immune repertoire and protein analysis in single
leukemia and microenvironmental cells in primary T-ALL patient samples and determine the necessary and
sufficient exhaustion receptor/ligands through functional perturbation in in vitro and in vivo models of T-ALL (aim
1); We will study epigenetic and transcriptional mechanisms that regulate immune evasion in T-ALL and develop
novel strategies to target T-cell dysfunction in pediatric leukemias by perturbing the epigenetic machinery (aim
2). Successful completion of this proposal is expected to uncover novel mechanisms of immune evasion in T-
ALL and will lead to development of innovative therapeutic strategies for targeting T-cell exhaustion in the
immune microenvironment in patients with high-risk T-ALL. The principles described in T-ALL will have a
significant impact on a wide variety of malignancies."
10873976,"ABSTRACT
 Genetic sex determination and sex chromosomes have evolved in both animals and plants. In mammals,
males are XY and females are XX. Degeneration of the Y chromosome and the difference in the number of X-
chromosome would lead to dose imbalance of X-linked gene products between male and female cells. To resolve
this problem, various dosage compensation mechanisms have evolved in heterogametic species. In mammals,
one of the two X chromosomes is transcriptionally silenced in females during X-inactivation. While X-inactivation
has been extensively studied as a paradigm for epigenetic regulation of sex chromosomes, it is largely controlled
by long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that remain elusive for their role in the evolution of dosage compensation
mechanisms. In general, human lncRNAs impact early development and affect human disease. However,
whether lncRNAs represent “byproducts” of transcription or essential biomolecules in gene regulation, e.g. X-
inactivation, has been under continuous debate. Experimental models for functional lncRNA and evolution of
RNA-mediated mechanisms are scarce.
 Our research focuses on a cluster of lncRNA genes functional for X-inactivation. This cluster of lncRNA
genes have evolved concomitantly on the X chromosome, from ancestral protein-coding genes through
pseudogenization and gain of RNA functions, coincidental with the evolution of X-inactivation along the
divergence of eutherian and marsupial mammals. Our recent data have demonstrated that, within this gene
cluster in the mouse genome, the lncRNA Jpx activates lncRNA Xist and functions as a molecular switch for
mouse X-inactivation. We have also reported, by comparing mouse and human homologs, functional
conservation of Jpx in X-inactivation despite overall sequence and RNA structural divergence. But questions
regarding 1) what sequence variations are determinant of lncRNA function for X-inactivation, 2) are there
regulatory features of lncRNA essential for X-inactivation, 3) what drives the function of Xic locus in X-
chromosome silencing, are unresolved. These are questions directly related to the evolution of dosage
compensation in mammals. In this project, we will (1) determine the regional sequence motifs of Jpx lncRNA that
are essential for its function in X-inactivation, (2) determine whether both trans and cis activities of Jpx lncRNA
are necessary for its function in X-inactivation, and (3) understand the function of Xic in chromosome silencing
and the requirement of its cis and trans activities by integrating the Xic sequence into an autosome. The proposed
research is anticipated to uncover insights into the molecular features of lncRNA for function in X-inactivation,
which will contribute to our understanding about not only lncRNA evolution, but also dosage compensation
evolution in mammals."
10875414,"Chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI, chemobrain), chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy
(CIPN) and gait changes are debilitating side-effects of cancer treatment with platinum agents (e.g., cisplatin),
taxanes, and vinca alkaloids. Cisplatin is widely used as a chemotherapeutic agent to treat ovarian malignancies.
Over 70% of women report experiencing CRCI, CIPN and/or falls during treatment or after completion, impairing
their quality of life. These neurotoxic impairments can also compromise treatment with cisplatin, influencing
 disease progression. Currently, there are no FDA-approved clinical interventions for the treatment of CRCI and
CIPN. Mechanistically, cisplatin-induced neuronal toxicity derives from nuclear and mitochondrial DNA damage,
and oxidative stress, which induce the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), p38MAPK
and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), leading to neuronal apoptosis. Our preliminary data show that in vitro
pharmacological inhibition with small molecule inhibitors, i.e., neflamapimod for p38MAPK and SP600125 for
JNK, prevents cisplatin-induced reduction in dendritic spine branching and density. Based on these data, we
hypothesize that inhibition of the p38MAPK/JNK pathways will prevent cisplatin-induced neuronal
apoptosis and damage, leading to attenuation of cognitive impairments, gait changes, and neuropathic
pain associated with CRCI and CIPN. In this project, we propose to determine if: (1) cisplatin-induced p38
MAPK/JNK signaling underlies structural and functional neuronal damage, using in vitro pharmacological
inhibition and siRNA silencing; (2) neflamapimod and SP600125 prevent cisplatin-induced neuropathy and gait
alterations in the ID8 syngeneic epithelial ovarian cancer in C57BL/6 mice and the transgenic breast cancer
model C3TAg in FVBN mice; and (3) cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity is attenuated by p38MAPK/JNK inhibition
without compromising its anti-cancer activity. Our Approach includes in vitro analysis of 2 separate neuronal cell
 lines, behavioral analysis using sensory testing for CIPN, testing of cognitive impairment, and novel
MouseWalker for gait changes in female mice using the two mouse cancer models. The proposed studies will
demonstrate the role of the p38MAPK and JNK in cisplatin induced CRCI/CIPN, and translational potential for
novel strategies to treat CRCI and CIPN. Due to health disparities, women suffer more disproportionately from
cancer and pain-related treatment than men. Therefore, testing our hypothesis in female mice is expected to
significantly advance the understanding and treatment of cisplatin-induced neurotoxic side effects and improve
the quality of life for women with cancer. Nevertheless, we expect that these findings may also apply to cisplatin-
 induced neurotoxicity in males and to other cancers than ovarian and breast cancers."

African-Americans/Blacks (AA/B) and Hispanics/Latinos (H/L) are vastly underrepresented in tobacco
regulatory sciences research. Yet as their smoking persists, these groups bear the most significant burden of
tobacco-related health diseases, including cancer. These disparities are due, in part, to the use of flavored
tobacco products, like little filtered cigars and cigarillos (LCCs), and the tobacco industry’s aggressive
promotion of LCCs to AA/B and H/L communities. An intended consequence of the anticipated flavor ban is the
smoking reduction of flavored LCCs. However, the tobacco industry’s repackaging of their flavored tobacco
products and their rhetoric about over-policing and discrimination against AA/B smokers threatens to disrupt
the health equity impacts of the impending flavor ban. Critical gaps in the scientific evidence exist about the
effects of exposure and receptivity to cigar product repackaging and socio-political rhetoric on AA/B and H/L
young adults’ (YA) smoking behavior. Our proposed project seeks to address gaps and provide evidence to the
FDA’s Impact, Marketing, and Behavioral domains by answering: “Do cigar product repackaging and rhetoric
about over-policing and illicit cigar trade influence AA/B and H/L YA’s flavor ban perceptions and predict future
LCC smoking behaviors among non-users and current users?"
10904940,"Risky sexual behaviors have high personal, social, and financial costs. Fathers’ talk with teens about sex can
protect teens from risky sexual behavior. However, the positive effects are limited, as few fathers talk with their
teens about sex and those who do talk report low frequency of talk. Impacts of parent programs to support teen
reproductive health are reduced by low participation and retention and lack of attention to father-specific
barriers and supports for talk with teens about sex. The proposed intervention will address limitations of
existing programs by using an online design with self-paced lessons and engaging both fathers and teens, and
add innovative elements identified in father-based needs assessments such as a father-facilitated peer-based
support group and identifying multiple approaches to talk with teens. Using Intervention Mapping, a systematic
protocol using theory, empirical evidence, and community input to develop health interventions, we will develop
an online intervention to support fathers’ health-promoting talk with their teens about sex and relationships,
using Social Cognitive Theory, and evaluate the intervention’s acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy.
The short-term goals of the intervention are to increase health-related knowledge, self-efficacy, and outcome
expectations as mechanisms to reduce teens’ sexual risk behavior. We plan to use a future R01 to conduct a
full-scale randomized control trial to assess the program’s efficacy to address long-term goals identified by NIH
of reducing teens’ STI transmission and increasing their contraceptive use. The aims of the current study are
1) To develop a 3-module prototype for a father-teen online program to support health-promoting family
communication about sex and relationships, and 2) To evaluate the program’s acceptability, feasibility, and
preliminary efficacy. To address Aim 1, we will develop program modules using online lessons and interactive
activities for fathers and teens to complete together, with ongoing stakeholder feedback from our Family
Advisory Board, which includes 10 fathers and ≈6 teens. Aim 2 will assess the program’s acceptability,
feasibility, and preliminary efficacy using a pilot study of 50 pairs of high school-aged teens and fathers.
Acceptability and feasibility assessment use data such as pilot enrollment, participant feedback, and survey
questionnaires. Given the limited project scope, preliminary efficacy will be explored by assessing initial
directionality for correlates of teens’ sexual behavior through pre- and post-intervention surveys, using
matched pair t-tests and t-tests to assess effects of teen gender on outcomes. This study is significant as it
translates research on father-teen talk about sex into a technology-based and potentially scalable intervention
designed to reduce teens’ sexual risk behavior. This study’s innovation lies in developing one of the first
interventions to address fathers as an under-utilized resource to support teens’ sexual health, using novel
approaches to maximize father-teen communication about sex. This study promotes public health by
developing an intervention with potential to reduce teens’ sexual risk behavior."
10825588,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Human papillomavirus positive (HPV+) oral cancer (OC), accounting for over 70% of oropharyngeal cancer
cases in North America and Europe, was found to be more aggressive with a higher tendency of metastasis
compared to HPV negative OC. It is believed that such aggressiveness is associated to the nature of its
oncogenic mechanisms triggered by HPV infection. HPV encodes two potent oncogenes E6 and E7 that
inactivate key tumor suppressors pRb and p53 and subsequently alter the expression spectrum of genes in oral
epithelial cells. To identify the molecular mechanisms of HPV oncogenesis, numerous studies have compared
the (epi)genomic profiles of HPV+ OC to normal oral epithelium, HPV negative OC, or other cancer types. These
studies have generated high-throughput sequencing datasets using different methods (transcriptomic, genomic
and epigenomic) and cellular conditions (normal, viral-infected and cancerous). However, these datasets were
not fully explored due to lack of comparable analysis platform to efficiently interrogate them, especially when
heterogeneity and batch effects are high across studies. We propose to leverage our data science experience
as well as close wet-lab collaborations to perform integrative analysis to identify HPV-specific biomarkers in
HPV+ OC. We propose to integrate (epi)genomic next generation sequencing datasets from 11 selected studies
(with addition if more availability in the future), involving 3 data types, 13 cell lines, 3 viral infection stages and 2
anatomically similar sites. At the core of the analysis is to remove potential batch effects and biases of the
integrated datasets and to set proper controls to nominate oncogenic biomarkers. To validate the findings, we
propose both dry and wet-lab experiments to evaluate candidate biomarkers. Insights from the proposed study
could advance our understanding of oral biology and potentially translate to novel therapeutics for HPV+ OC."

 Brain aging is characterized by reduced cognitive capacities, learning and memory. The exact mechanisms
of brain aging remain elusive. Because aging is the greatest risk factor for major debilitating neurodegenerative
disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), it is important to uncover mechanisms underlying brain aging in
order to develop effective therapies for age-related neurodegenerative diseases.
 AD is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and a leading cause of disability and death. However,
the precise mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis remains to be elucidated. Although many transgenic
mouse models have been generated for AD research and these models are important for our understanding of
the pathological basis of the disease, it is increasingly recognized that there are significant species differences
between mouse and human neural cells. Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish human disease modeling
platforms to complement studies in animal models for AD research.
 Direct reprogramming is a cellular reprogramming technology, which allows direct conversion of one type of
somatic cells, such as fibroblasts, into another type of somatic cells, such as neurons. It has been shown that
direct reprogramming enables generation of human neurons that possess key elements of cellular aging.
Therefore, directly reprogrammed cells could provide a human cellular platform for us to model brain aging and
age-related late-onset diseases, such as late-onset AD (LOAD).
 The objective of this proposal is to develop human age-relevant glial cellular models using direct
reprogramming technology, in order to recapitulate age-associated phenotypes in brain aging and
neurodegeneration and uncover novel underlying mechanisms. Increasing evidence suggests that astrocytes
play important roles in brain health and pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, we propose to
establish cellular models for brain aging and AD using astrocytes directly reprogrammed from fibroblasts of aged
subjects and LOAD patients and co-cultures of astrocytes with other brain cell types, including microglia,
oligodendrocytes, and neurons. We hypothesize that cellular aging regulates astrocyte function and cell-cell
interactions to modulate brain aging phenotypes and LOAD pathologies. Accordingly, we propose the following
Specific Aims:Aim 1: To generate age-associated astrocytes through direct reprogramming and evaluate how
cellular aging regulates astrocytic functions. Aim 2: To determine whether and how astrocytic cellular aging
modulates neuroinflammation and neuronal phenotypes. Aim 3: To determine whether and how astrocytic
cellular aging regulates OPC properties and myelination. The proposed studies will likely help to define roles of
glial cellular aging in brain functional deterioration during aging and uncover the underlying mechanisms, which
could lead to the development of novel strategies to maintain brain health and reduce risk for AD. The knowledge
gained from this study could help us to design novel therapeutic strategies for AD."

health, data scientists could play a transformative role in exploiting the big data revolution to address the multi-
pronged health challenges in sub-Saharan Africa. However, there is a severe lack of well-trained data scientists
and home-grown educational programs to enable context-specific training. We propose to advance public health
research in Eastern Africa by establishing new multi-tiered training programs in health data science, with initial
focus on Ethiopia and Kenya due to well-established partnerships and demonstrated needs. A partnership
between Columbia University (CU, USA), Addis Ababa University (AAU, Ethiopia) and University of Nairobi
(UofN, Kenya) will leverage world class strengths in data science at CU to enhance the overall capacity in
Ethiopia and Kenya by building upon the readiness and national prominence of AAU and UofN. Using in-person
and distance modes of training, we will (i) develop new context-specific MS programs in public health data
science, designed to be sustainable well beyond the funding period; (ii) undertake a faculty mentoring program
to build and strengthen capacity in health data science for promising Eastern African scientists; and (ii) conduct
a short-term training program structured around targeted short courses and workshops for a wide spectrum of
trainees. The faculty mentoring mechanism will initially start with partnerships between CU and East African
faculty, and will progress into groupings across the three institutions. The skills developed through this program
will in turn strengthen the overall training and research capacity in data science. To broaden the reach into the
scientific and policy community, the short-term training will engage trainees from partnering governmental and
non-governmental stakeholders and the private sector. The program will leverage several ongoing research
projects led by team members or affiliated partners on environmental health, exposure assessment, remote
satellite data, occupational exposures, climate change, infectious diseases, health surveillance, and health
system monitoring and evaluation, which will be used as immersion opportunities to enable hands-on experience
with new data science techniques for trainees. Evaluation and monitoring will track the success of the training
programs and of the trainees’ achievement of their development goals, successful completion of the research
training, scientific presentations and publications, and the sustainability and growth of the MS degree programs.
In Year 5, we will broaden the training program to the wider East Africa region through sharing of curricula and
inviting trainees for engagement. We will also explore the feasibility of incorporating the courses we have
developed into existing PhD curricula or creating new PhD programs in public health data science. Beyond the
educational programs and collaborations, our project is designed to cultivate long-term regional collaboration,
lifelong learning skills, and a supportive community of researchers committed to open science, algorithmic
fairness, and “data science for good,” ultimately leading to better public health practice."
10770567,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Among individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), some of the worst prognoses come from comorbidity
with accelerated brain growth, known as disproportionate megalencephaly (DM). ASD-DM is associated with
regressive autism, slower gains in IQ, greater difficulties with expressive language, and more severe cognitive
defects. Recent genome sequencing studies of probands with ASD have identified an excess of rare de novo
heterozygous mutations of genes expressed in early fetal development that impact cell cycle and proliferation.
Although recurrent variants have been identified in a handful of well-known ASD-DM genes, including CHD8
and PTEN, many genes impacted by de novo variants in patients with ASD-DM have never before been
reported, thus requiring sifting through hundreds to thousands of candidate genes with unknown significance.
To ultimately confirm disease genes, experimental validation is necessary. The proposed study hypothesizes
that knockout of ASD-DM candidate gene orthologs will result in alterations in the abundance of specific cell
types in the developing zebrafish brain, reminiscent of those observed in human patients as well as mouse and
cerebral organoid models. Due to their small size, robust reproduction, embryonic transparency, and rapid
development, zebrafish are well suited for functional studies of developmental genes. Although knockouts of
single genes in zebrafish have successfully pinpointed defects, no systematic study characterizing multiple
genes in parallel has been performed for ASD. One limitation is the lack of higher-throughput quantitative
assays to characterize neurodevelopment. Further, very few studies have assessed disease-causing missense
substitutions using fish. The primary goal of the proposed project is to functionally characterize ASD-DM
candidate genes and develop an in vivo strategy to rapidly assay identified patient mutations to measure their
impact on neurodevelopment. To achieve this goal, the project will focus on the following aims: (1)
functionally assay patient loss-of-function and missense variants of unknown significance in the
conserved human/fish ortholog of a single ASD-DM gene, CHD8; and (2) target multiple ASD-DM
candidate genes identified from disease sequencing studies using a higher-throughput gene editing
method to characterize their impacts on brain development in zebrafish. As mutants are identified, future
work includes developing small-molecule screens to rescue quantitative phenotypes of zebrafish carrying
mutations of candidate genes generated from our study. These avenues of research differentiate our use of
zebrafish from ongoing mouse studies. If successful, the developed approaches will significantly improve our
ability to pinpoint disease genes critical in improving diagnostic measures facilitating earlier interventions and
treatments as well as contributing to a better understanding of the etiology underlying megalencephaly in ASD."
10877850,"Project Summary and Abstract
 Despite the rapidly advancing landscape of modern biology, the majority of experiences that K-12
learners have with biology are still rooted in traditional procedural and prescriptive approaches. There is a
critical need to engage students in a more 21st century approach to biology – one that emphasizes
open-ended exploration and creativity as key elements of scientific practice. Over the last five years as part of
our previous SEPA award, we have developed an award-winning approach to informal biology education,
biotinkering, that authentically engages young people with science as a personally relevant and creative
process by supporting learner agency and choice. Our project, Adapting and Scaling the Biotinkering Approach
through a Community of Practice (CoP) Model, aims to empower other informal science institutions to
participate in and co-author the future of biotinkering with us. To be thoughtful about ensuring that our
burgeoning approach can meaningfully contribute to bringing more diverse perspectives into STEM fields, our
proposed CoP centers community and co-design. Community relationships at each participating site will be
integrated throughout the project to help build a foundation for biotinkering that is more inclusive and culturally
relevant, especially for marginalized communities.
 To reach our desired impact, we have the following 3 aims. First, we will establish a thriving Biotinkering
Community of Practice to support diverse practitioners in gaining confidence with doing biotinkering in their
own contexts. By using a CoP model to do institutional capacity building, we can create lasting impact on the
field by building a dispersed network of biotinkering hubs equipped to provide ongoing support and mentorship
to other practitioners. Second, all four founding members of our Biotinkering CoP will develop culturally
relevant biotinkering activities, co-designed with local communities, to generate a more diverse repertoire of
experiences for varied audiences and environments. This will result in hands-on biotinkering experiences being
implemented around the nation, reaching tens of thousands of young people and providing learners with
pathways to develop stronger STEM identities. And third, we will identify strategies and promising practices
that can be used by practitioners to adopt biotinkering as an inclusive approach that centers community voices.
Our new community and inclusion-focused resources, forged from diverse community perspectives and
co-design learnings, will better support the adaptation of biotinkering to diverse situations and contexts, making
it easier to further scale this work to additional informal learning sites and new communities.
 This approach can generate the types of informal learning experiences society needs to serve as
inspirational entry points for a more diverse next generation of biotech and biomedical innovators. Lessons
learned from the successes and challenges of this project can also offer valuable insights about using CoPs as
a model for self-sustaining scaling and knowledge transfer within the informal science learning field."

Malaria continues to severely impact public health in countries around the world. Some countries like Ecuador
made impressive progress in the first 10-15 years of this century. Nevertheless, recent years have seen
stagnation and malaria cases are increasing again. While most cases of Plasmodium falciparum in Northwest
Ecuador appear to originate in the Pacific coast of Colombia, asymptomatic reservoirs of this parasite are
common and may be important in maintaining transmission within Ecuador. One of the main problems for
malaria elimination is the presence of asymptomatic reservoirs. To better understand the malaria transmission
dynamics in this pre-eliminating region, we will characterize the genetics of the parasites circulating in
northwest Ecuador (symptomatic and asymptomatic), identify serological biosignatures of infection and define
the relationships between the clinical outcome of the infection, parasite genetics and serological markers.
Lastly, we will validate the role of acquired immunity in disease severity, clonal persistence, and outbreak
emergence through innovative in vitro assays. This project will inform local control decisions in Ecuador, and,
most importantly, provide a model for understanding disease persistence in other pre-elimination settings
around the world."
10808941,"Project Summary/Abstract
Healthy skeletal muscle slows cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s patients. The 3-fold increase in glucocorticoid
production that occurs in Alzheimer’s patients renders their skeletal muscle vulnerable to glucocorticoid-
induced myopathy, which is the most common, toxic, non-inflammatory muscle disease in those with elevated
glucocorticoids. While this myopathy would decrease muscle health and augment cognitive decline, there are
no ways to prevent glucocorticoid myopathy in this population. The inability to treat glucocorticoid myopathy in
Alzheimer’s patients limits a clinician’s ability to preserve cognitive function. Despite this issue, our new data
show that resistance exercise may be an immediate way for Alzheimer’s patients to blunt the signals that
initiate glucocorticoid myopathy. Specifically, our laboratory’s recent publication in healthy muscle shows that a
bout of resistance exercise reduces nuclear translocation of the glucocorticoid receptor, a critical step in the
process by which glucocorticoids initiate myopathy. The glucocorticoid receptor initiates the myopathy in large
part by changing the muscle transcriptome. Accordingly, our new preliminary data show that a bout of
resistance exercise will also reverse the glucocorticoid-mediated induction of some glucocorticoid target genes.
While promising as a therapy, Alzheimer’s disease induces a novel muscle pathology characterized by
accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques that compromises skeletal muscle function, which could render
resistance exercise less- or ineffective at mitigating the signals that initiate glucocorticoid myopathy. Therefore,
the objective of this proposal is to test whether Alzheimer’s skeletal muscle disease pathology affects the
ability of resistance exercise to mitigate the signals that initiate glucocorticoid myopathy. Aim 1 will define the
impact of Alzheimer’s muscle disease pathology on the ability of resistance exercise to reduce glucocorticoid
receptor activation in the skeletal muscle. Aim 2 will classify and characterize the glucocorticoid target genes
in healthy muscle and muscle with Alzheimer’s disease pathology based upon how their hormone-regulated
gene expression responds to a bout of resistance exercise. In all, this pilot study will define the extent to which
resistance exercise can blunt the signals that initiate glucocorticoid myopathy in the presence of Alzheimer’s
muscle pathology. These outcomes are significant because they will provide key information for clinicians to
effectively use resistance exercise as part of a comprehensive strategy to prevent glucocorticoid myopathy and
preserve cognitive function in the Alzheimer’s population."

The paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) regulates motivated behaviors including behaviors induced
by stress exposure. The PVT receives extensive projections from the locus coeruleus (LC), an important
component of the stress response system that mediates arousal and cognitive aspects of the stress response
and the primary source of norepinephrine (NE) in the brain. Thus, both the PVT and the LC play important
roles in arousal and attention during stress, thus contributing to positive and negative valence states, RDoC
constructs important in multiple psychopathologies. However, the role of LC projections to the PVT in
mediating responses to stress has received little to no attention. Our previous work on the PVT in rats
showed that the posterior division of the PVT (pPVT) preferentially regulates responses to repeated stress.
Further, preliminary data suggest that neuronal activity in the pPVT is higher in animals susceptible to
repeated social defeat compared to resilient and control animals. Susceptibility to defeat is associated with
greater stimulatory inputs to LC cells. These data suggest that activity of LC projections to pPVT are
enhanced in individuals susceptible to the effects of repeated social defeat. Based on preliminary and
published data, the central hypothesis of this exploratory/developmental proposal is that elevations in
activity of LC/NE projections to pPVT lead to susceptibility to social defeat. Both male and female mice
will be studied. Experiments will use the GRABNE sensor to assess NE release through fiber photometry in
the pPVT during repeated social defeat and will use chemogenetics to inhibit pPVT-projecting LC cells in
DBH-cre mice. We expect that NE release in the pPVT will be highest after defeat in mice that go on to be
socially avoidant/susceptible and that inhibition of pPVT-projecting LC-NE cells during social defeat will
reduce social avoidance thereby reducing susceptibility to defeat. We further expect greater NE release and
less of an impact of LC-pPVT inhibition in female compared to male mice. The completion of these studies
will provide the first information on how LC-NE inputs to the PVT regulate stress responses and the
first information on sex differences in functions of these inputs. Elucidating the impact of NE release in
the pPVT and of activity in pPVT-projecting LC cells will provide new mechanistic insights into individual
differences in the response to stress."

Anti-HIV antibodies can interact with a variety of Fc-receptors (FcRs) that are differentially expressed on host
effector cells and exert a broad range of functions including antibody-dependent cell phagocytosis (ADCP)
and antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxcity (ADCC). Passive as well as active vaccination in human
and non human primate (NHP) studies have indicated that ADCC as well as phagocytosis are consistent
correlates of protection. However, testing of the mechanistic relevance of IgG subclasses and allotypes on
antiviral activity remains extremely limited. FcR-bearing cells also have a broad distribution which can vary
widely by cell type, tissue, and species, and remain incompletely characterized in NHP, particularly in mucosal
sites of lentivirus transmission. Further, compartmental considerations on the relative contributions of ADCC
and ADCP to interruption of early HIV and SIV replication remain underexplored. Importantly, we have
demonstrated disparate expansion of transient and tissue-resident NK cells in both HIV and SIV infections, but
the relevance of these populations, as well as tissue-resident or trafficking subpopulations of other FcR-
bearing cells remains unclear. Defining the events that take place in these early mucosal foci will provide
critical insights into functional interactions that inhibit ongoing virus replication and spread in a highly dynamic
mucosal environment that includes a range of genetic variability of the IgG and FcR repertoires and the
significant heterogeneity of NHP FcR compared to humans. This Project will explore the specific hypothesis
that optimal antiviral antibody activity is impacted by the tissue distribution of effector cells and FcR expression,
which can be tuned to enhance vaccine responses and subsequent protection against SHIV challenge. The
specific aims for Project 3 are as follows:
Aim 1: Define the In vivo recognition of SIV/SHIV-infected cells by antibody and FcR-bearing cells in
the GI and FRT mucosae.
Aim 2. Define the antiviral properties of human immunoglobulin subclasses in vivo.
Aim 3. Define the relative contribution of FcR-bearing cells to protection against mucosal SHIV
challenge."

knowledge base of pediatric critical care medicine. The overall aim of this site proposal is for the University of
Minnesota Masonic Children's Hospital (UMMCH), under the leadership of Site Principal Investigator, Marie
Steiner, MD, MS, to join this expanded iteration of CPCCRN. UMMCH is a free-standing, quaternary care,
academic children's hospital located in Minneapolis, MN, serving children and families across a diverse range
of racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds. It has a 24-bed mixed medical/surgical and cardiac pediatric
intensive care unit and offers the full spectrum of pediatric and surgical subspecialty services. UMMCH has a
strong history of clinical research and innovation in conjunction with the resources of the University of
Minnesota, the state's land grant university. Pediatric critical care research includes numerous completed and
ongoing studies championed by multiple faculty, including the Co-Investigators for this grant. With increasing
support from internal and external grants and the development of the Pediatric Device Innovation Center, the
Division was third in the Department in launching new studies in 2019, behind Hematology/Oncology and
HSCT. Children's Minnesota (Children's) will serve as our Ancillary Site under the leadership of Alberto
Orioles, MD. Children's is a not-for-profit, freestanding children's hospital also located in Minneapolis, with a
long-standing history of participation in critical care research, including several CPCCRN studies. Together,
UMMCH and Children's will provide access to 55 pediatric ICU beds and over 3500 annual admissions, which
captures the majority of critically ill children throughout the Upper Midwest and will facilitate participation in
large clinical trials. The proposed “Personalized Immunomodulation in Sepsis-Induced Multiple Organ
Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS)” trial addresses the hypothesis that immunosuppressed children will benefit
from administration of granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor and that children with
hyperinflammation will benefit from targeted anti-inflammatory therapy. Benefit will be evaluated in terms of
recovery from MODS, as well as short- and long-term health-related quality of life measures. This partnership
has the knowledge and skills to successfully complete this trial, including sample collection and processing for
immunophenotyping and collection of short- and long-term outcomes. Drs. Steiner and Orioles have the full
support of their respective institutions to participate in CPCCRN and to prioritize patient recruitment and
accrual to its studies. The institutions are strongly committed to collaboration with CPCCRN sites and the Data
Coordinating Center to conduct the proposed and future research. Our clinical center and ancillary site will
provide local mentorship for our highly talented young faculty and will support their participation in the central
CPCCRN mentoring activities that are described in Section B.3 of the required CPCCRN Network

all Center components: Pilot/Exploratory Studies Core, Research Education Component, and three Resource
Cores: the Molecular Measures Core (MMC), the Health and Mobility Measures Core (HMC) and the Analysis
Core (AC). Operations of the Duke OAIC are directed by an effective central leadership and decision-making
body called the Internal Operating Committee (IOC), which consists of the Duke OAIC Director, Co-Director,
and the Core Leads. The LAC also provides administrative support for a Data Integration Working Group, a
forum providing collaborative research activities and accessible expertise. Another key function of the LAC is to
ensure the Duke OAIC is fully integrated at the institutional level by soliciting input from and promoting
interactions with members of other units of the Medical Center, the University, and the Durham VA. Finally, the
LAC ensures appropriate expertise is available to direct the selection of future projects, pilots, and junior
faculty awardees by engaging experts to serve in an Independent Review Panel and External Advisory Board.
The overall goal of the LAC is to provide the scientific leadership and administrative infrastructure for aging and
geriatrics research in the Center theme ‘to understand and optimize reserve and resilience’. The specific
aims of the LAC are: (1) To provide overall coordination, integration and administration of the Duke OAIC; (2)
To stimulate, monitor, sustain and evaluate the progress of the OAIC towards achieving its research and
education goals; (3) To assess scientific opportunities for innovative research in the theme with an emphasis
on translational and interdisciplinary research; (4) To utilize and develop resources effectively to meet the
goals of the Duke Pepper OAIC. Through these Aims, the LAC promotes the development of early-stage
investigators in aging and geriatrics research and ensures the coordination, integration, funding, and
translation of research within the Duke OAIC in support of our theme and our ultimate goal of improving the
independence of older adults."

Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN). The overall aim of this proposal is to advance the field
of pediatric critical care medicine through the collaborative development and execution of transformative
studies that benefit critically ill children. As one of the current CPCCRN sites, we (Hall – PI, Yates – Co-I,
Steel – RC) have consistently been leaders in subject enrollment and project development. Dr. Hall’s Immune
Surveillance Laboratory (ISL) at the Abigail Wexner Research Institute at Nationwide Children’s Hospital has
served a central role in the two interventional drug trials performed by the network this cycle. These trials
using the immunostimulant drug GM-CSF for the reversal of critical illness-induced immune suppression,
established the safety and feasibility of multi-center, real-time immune function monitoring and modulation in
our hands and, along with the current cycle’s PHENOMS sepsis phenotyping study, led us directly to the
proposed study, “Personalized Immunomodulation in Sepsis-induced MODS”. This study includes two distinct,
embedded, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials of immunomodulation that are tailored to
each subject’s prospectively-tested immune phenotype. The ISL will provide highly standardized immune
function and inflammation testing kits with which the network already has extensive experience. Subjects who
are found to have severe immune suppression without severe inflammation will be allocated to the “GM-CSF
for Reversal of Immunoparalysis in Sepsis-induced MODS (GRACE)-2” study where they will receive GM-CSF
or placebo. Subjects with moderate to severe systemic inflammation will be allocated to the “Targeted
Reversal of Inflammation in Pediatric Sepsis-induced MODS (TRIPS)” study in which subjects will be
adaptively randomized to receive the anti-inflammatory drugs anakinra, tocilizumab, or placebo. This highly
innovative approach is designed to ensure that the right subject receives the right immune care that matches
their immunologic derangement. Our primary outcome, the cumulative PELOD-2 score over 28 days, will
assess both ICU morbidity and mortality, and our secondary outcomes will assess long term morbidity and
health-related quality of life. This project is an ideal platform for ancillary studies and will represent a
transformative approach to sepsis care in children. Nationwide Children’s Hospital and Rainbow Babies and
Children’s Hospital (Shein – PI, Slain – Co-I) are certain to be strong contributors and collaborators in the next
cycle of CPCCRN and will help move our field forward through the generation of new, generalizable knowledge
that will inform the treatment of critically ill children."

The Molecular Measures Core (MMC) provides a centralized resource, analytical tools and expertise to
measure a broad array of molecular analytes in support of Duke OAIC projects in their work to understand and
optimize reserve and resilience. The MMC has served as an integral Resource Core in support of the Duke
OAIC since 2006. For this funding cycle, the MMC will focus on molecular analyses that provide mechanistic
insights into resiliencies at the cellular, tissue or organ levels that are expected to increase our understanding
of the means to optimize reserve and resilience at the whole person level. The MMC will provide molecular
analytic, mentoring and consultative support for a host of Research Education Component (REC) Scholar
Projects, Pilot/Exploratory Studies (PESs) and External Projects (EPs). These projects test hypotheses related
to aging across the lifespan, mechanisms underlying reserve and resilience in human, primates and in vitro,
and involve a range of patient and sample types. The MMC is capable of providing services to measure a
broad array of cellular, molecular, biochemical and metabolic factors. The most pertinent Core services in the
next funding cycle will include molecular measures of inflammation, targeted and untargeted metabolomics,
epigenetic measures of miRNAs related to longevity, molecular measures of biological age, and analyses of
extracellular vesicles. In addition, the MMC will conduct a Developmental Project (MMC-DP) to develop new
capabilities for profiling coronavirus serologies to evaluate prior SARS-CoV2 infection as a modifier of
cardiorespiratory and metabolic reserve in a substudy of the MoTrPAC cohort (Years 1-2). This MMC-DP
validated serological testing will be made available to the Duke OAIC researchers and projects in the latter
years of funding. The MMC will also use the senescent model system (developed in the current funding period)
to test interventions including mimics and inhibitors of ‘longevity miRNA’ and extracellular vesicles to promote
resilience (Years 1-5). In addition, the MMC will provide Pathways Analysis (using Ingenuity Systems) of
molecular data to identify potential biological networks involved in reserve and resilience. The exciting focus on
resilience in this cycle provides an opportunity to explore the latest theories on aging that are particularly
amenable and suited to evaluation by molecular approaches. The application of molecular and pathways
analyses to these projects are expected to provide objective insights into the mechanisms underlying reserve
and resilience in support of the mission of the Duke OAIC."

In this PL1 application, the UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh and our ancillary site Mercy Children’s
Hospital Kansas City are applying to be two of 24 patient enrolling centers in the new Eunice Kennedy Shriver
National Institutes of Child Health and Development Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network.
The first large randomized double blind placebo trial proposed by the steering committee to be undertaken is
the “Personalized Immunomodulation in Sepsis-induced Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome” trial in
children. Sepsis occurs when infection overwhelms a person. If the patient’s organs shutdown then the patient
develops Multiple Organ Dysfunction which can progress to Multiple Organ Failure and death. Sepsis kills one
in 5 people worldwide with children accounting for the majority of these deaths. Death from sepsis is related in
part to the patient not being able to fight infection as well as not being able to control inflammation. The
molecular biology revolution offers us yet unproven hope that we can temper this ancient foe using technology
that was not available in the past. After attaining parental consents we will draw blood from our children with
sepsis and send it to Nationwide Children’s Hospital where their immune monitoring laboratory will determine
whether our children are fighting infection and controlling inflammation well enough to survive, not fighting
infection well enough, or not controlling inflammation well enough. If a child is not fighting infection well
enough then we will be given masked syringes that will either be placebo (usual care), or recombinant
Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (immune enhancer) that our nurse will administer in a
blinded randomization schema for seven days. If a child is not able to control inflammation well enough then
we will be given masked syringes that will either be placebo (usual care), or recombinant Interleukin 1 receptor
antagonist protein (anti-inflammatory), or Interleukin 6 monoclonal antibody (anti-inflammatory) that our nurse
will administer in a blinded adaptive randomized fashion for seven days or one day, respectively. The Data
Coordinating Center and the Data Safety Monitoring Board will determine whether treatment reduces organ, as
well as when to stop enrollment for benefit, harm, or futility.
Our two centers are well positioned to aid the success of the new network as 1) we provide 4800 patients per
year for clinical studies making this planned trial and other future trials feasible; 2) we previously performed the
pivotal studies on pediatric sepsis induced multiple organ failure that have been used to design the proposed
trial thus assuring our expertise; and 3) we provide a group of young investigators who will become our field’s
next generation of independent investigators with mentorship attained through participation in the network."

resource for Center investigators seeking advice, mentoring, training, and equipment for valid, sensitive, and
reliable whole-person, non-molecular measures. A panel of 13 members, with complementary expertise in
measurement across multiple domains, comprises the Core. The HMC will provide highly integrated, customized
support to investigators supported by our Research Education Component (REC), Pilot/Exploratory Studies Core
(PESC), External Projects (EPs), and the larger Duke Community engaged by the Duke Older Americans
Independence Center. The Core will support investigators by meeting regularly, or as needed, throughout the
full spectrum of project development; from early phase planning, to final interpretation of findings, to subsequent
grant preparations to dissemination and/or implementation. These meetings will concurrently involve members
of the Molecular Measures and Analysis Cores to ensure maximal synergy. The HMC will address three Specific
Aims. Aim 1 - To provide centralized measurement expertise, available for consultation and mentoring to
advance our thematic investigations of physical reserve and resilience. Aim 2 - To develop measurement
protocols and train personnel in administration and data collection. Aim 3 - To identify gaps in reserve and
resiliency measures and develop and/or adapt innovative new measurement approaches for related outcomes.
Up to three REC Scholars and three PES awardees will be supported during the first year of funding. Members
of the HMC will also provide service to EPs, and propose an innovative Developmental Project to extend
measurement and predictive capacity of the electronic health record and other big administrative data sources.
Two successful past workshops are proposed again; one to provide training in physical performance and
functional testing, and one to provide training in ambulatory measurement and data collection, to augment the
measurement capabilities of our trainees. New measures will be added to the HMC website and the Duke Pepper
Center Study Dashboard will be developed and posted for users. The dashboard is an interactive data
visualization dashboard that gives OAIC investigators the opportunity to interact with aggregated biomarker and
physical performance data collected from OAIC-affiliated studies spanning three decades. The Dashboard will
provide OAIC investigators with preliminary data to use for grant applications as well as a large, well-curated
dataset for new analyses. The HMC will provide an invaluable service to the Center, which will lead to greater
understanding of reserve and resilience, and which in turn, will point to opportunities to improve the current and
future health and well-being of aging Americans across the lifespan."

Discovery of new therapeutic approaches to save the lives and improve the recovery of children with critical

CNH has been proud to be a part of the 3 previous CPCCRN cycles starting in 2004. As a clinical center with
over 4000 ICU admissions each year while serving a diverse community in the Washington/Maryland/Virginia
region, we stand uniquely poised to enroll subjects in innovative clinical studies. By including children from our
center, from our ancillary site (Children’s Hospital of Richmond [CHoR]) and the other 22 sites within this new
CPCCRN, sufficient numbers of children will be available for enrollment and ensure the generalizability of the
findings. We bring an experienced research team to this new project. Our PI team is experienced at research,
specialists in neurological and cardiac critical care and leaders at CNH. In these capacities, they will identify and
support young investigators to participate in CPCCRN activities while also ensuring the success of the project(s)
within CPCCRN. The PIs have been deeply involved with the preliminary studies that have led up to the
proposed studies of personalized medicine to treat children with multiple organ failure. We believe this novel
approach will finally advance the field past the hurdle of only being able to use “supportive” care for such patients
and lead to substantial improvements in overall function, quality of life and family functioning. Moreover, we
believe that new, funded projects can be brought into CPCCRN by investigators within our center to make further
advances in the field of pediatric critical care."
10890671,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Analysis Core (AC)
The Analysis Core supports the Duke OAIC effort to understand and optimize reserve and resilience by
providing data management and analytic support (Aim 1), providing methodological instruction (Aim 2), and
incorporating and developing innovative biostatistical analytic methodologies into the OAIC program (Aim 3).
The Analysis Core contains all the expertise needed to provide analytic support to junior and senior faculty
across the range of study designs and analytic issues, including biostatisticians with expertise in study design,
longitudinal analysis, psychometrics and estimation of latent variables; bioinformaticists with experience in
genetic and high dimensional data analysis; and day-to-day monitoring of studies and data management. Data
management will use secure web-based methods (REDCap) and methods for managing high dimensional
metabolomic, proteomic, and genetic data. Duke OAIC supported studies are constructed and managed so
that standardized analytic methods and common measures across studies can be employed. In addition to
provision of technical analytic and data management support, the Analysis Core will provide consultation and
training support to the faculty of the Duke OAIC (Aim 2). The Core will also pursue methodologic goals of
interest to biostatisticians advance statistical science and address analytic issues encountered in current
research (Aim 3). In particular, the study of resilience and reserve will require estimation of multi-parameter
models and latent classes. A Developmental Project is proposed to develop estimation models and assess
statistical performance (false detection rate, stability, power, bias, and validity) of these new classes of models.
Working closely with the Molecular Measures and Health and Mobility Measures Cores, the Analysis Core will
focus on methods for examining trajectories of change in the biological and clinical variables, develop
aggregation techniques for this high dimensional data, establish temporal ordering, assess mediation and
moderation pathways, and assess the statistical properties and constancy of the relationships across studies."

Loss of stability and falls is a major risk factor for injury and death in older adults. Previously overlooked,
lifetime noise exposure has been shown to cause damage to the vestibular periphery; although, animal models
and human studies that can provide a mechanistic basis connecting noise-induced vestibular dysfunction and
age-related fall risk are limited. The vestibular system plays a critical role in detection of head movements and
orientation with respect to gravity and is essential for normal vision and postural control. Due to their
anatomical proximity to the cochlea, the otolith organs are exposed to sound pressure and are at risk for noise
overstimulation, which may contribute to vestibular dysfunction. However, damage may not be limited to the
otolith organs. Recent studies have linked noise overstimulation to decreased vestibular nerve activity and loss
of a specialized class of irregularly firing vestibular afferents which exhibit enhanced sensitivity to acceleration.
It is likely that these afferents play an important role initiating postural compensation for abrupt changes in
head or body position due to their physiological characteristics and their projection to secondary vestibular
neurons that project to the spinal cord. Therefore, the effects of noise may accelerate disability associated with
natural aging. The goal of this proposal is to characterize vestibular loss associated with natural aging and how
it is compounded by cumulative noise exposures throughout one’s life. Thus, we will systematically investigate
the effects of noise exposure across the lifespan on otolith and canal structure and function (Aim 1),
specifically address the extent of irregular afferent damage and its functional consequences (Aim 2), and asses
changes in posture, mobility and balance with noise exposure (Aim 3). Changes in sensory cell synapses will
be correlated with vestibular reflex impairment and fall risk associated with postural instability and loss of
balance. To improve our understanding of how these changes occur over the lifetime, we will assess
anatomical and functional changes in early-, middle-, and late-adulthood. Further, functional experiments will
be done in parallel in rats and human participants for maximal translation of our results to the clinic.
Individually, both animal and rodent studies have proven invaluable to our understanding of the effects of noise
exposure on vestibular function. However, both have limitations that can be best addressed with a set of
complimentary studies in the two systems. This proposal describes a comprehensive, multidisciplinary
approach that strives to evaluate the underlying mechanisms in increased falls and fall risk due to a history of
noise exposure in older adults. The susceptibility of these individuals to potentially fatal falls underscores the
need for a systematic approach, that can eventually result in improved training and rehabilitation methods to be
used with this population."
10886148,"White and brown adipocytes not only play a central role in energy storage and combustion, but are also
dynamic secretory cells that produce signaling molecules that link levels of energy stores to other vital
physiological systems. Disruption of the signaling properties of adipocytes, as occurs in obesity, contributes to
insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and other metabolic disorders. Fat cells have been estimated to secrete
more than 1,000 polypeptides and microproteins and even large number of small molecule metabolites. The
great majority of the adipocyte secretome has not been defined or characterized and addressing this gap in
knowledge is the main goal of this collaborative, interdisciplinary team project. A major obstacle has been the
lack of suitable technologies to quantitatively identify circulating proteins and metabolites, determine their
cellular origin, and elucidate their function. Building on compelling preliminary data and key innovations from
members of this team, we will generate the first encyclopedia of the white and brown adipocyte secretome in
mouse models and humans. Specifically, we will (1) Generate an encyclopedia of the secretome of murine
adipocytes, (2) Characterize the adipocyte secretome in response to physiological stress and in pathological
states, (3) Characterize the adipose secretome in humans, and (4) Characterize the function of the adipocyte
secretome. These studies, which span from basic biology to human subject investigation will only be possible
by optimizing tools within diverse disciplines and at their intersection. This project has the potential to address
questions central to the mission of the NIDDK such as the molecular basis for the links between obesity and
type 2 diabetes and understanding whether the anti-diabetic benefits of brown fat are conveyed by secreted
mediators. Our studies have the potential to identify new secreted mediators with roles in obesity, type 2
diabetes and metabolic diseases, catalyze the development of new technologies, provide a crucial new
resource for researchers and clinicians, and lead to new biomarkers and therapies."

The sense of taste is associated with food appeal and feeding preferences in diverse animals. Taste
preferences have ties to human ingestive disorders that impact nutritional status and health. Yet the neural
basis by which taste sensations drive ingestive preference or avoidance remains only poorly understood.
A central question concerns how the brain represents information about taste hedonics. In rodents, neural
messages for taste arrive at the brain stem parabrachial nuclei. Parabrachial neurons are partly
multimodal. Recent data from our lab show gustatory sensations stimulate neurons in parabrachial regions
that integrate aversive sensory and nociceptive messages from afferents across the body. Our goal here is
to understand if taste messages are processed by broadly integrative neurons in the parabrachial complex
that communicate with the amygdala, and if traditionally defined taste neurons constitute a subpopulation
of these cells. These questions have key implications for understanding the functional organization of
gustatory circuits and the neural basis of hedonic value coding for taste and other senses. In Aim #1, we
will use in vivo neurophysiology and optogenetic circuit mapping in anesthetized mice to systematically
study the sensitivity of parabrachial neurons to gustatory stimulation of the oral cavity and nociceptive
stimulation of body extremities supplied by spinal afferents. Parabrachial neurons will be evaluated for
projections to the amygdala, which is associated with emotional affect. Central interactions between taste
and spinal somatosensory stimuli will also be studied. Moreover, we will address how inhibitory input from
the amygdala influences taste and somatosensory sensitivity in parabrachial taste-integrative cells. Finally,
studies in this Aim will use optical tagging of a genetic type of parabrachial neuron involved with aversive
and protective behaviors to determine if gustatory-integrative parabrachial neurons are these cells. Aim #2
will use reversible silencing of this genetic cell class during measurement of taste-guided behaviors to
determine the role of this parabrachial neuron type in innate gustatory preferences. Overall, these studies
aim to elucidate novel neural circuit and genetic features of gustatory-active parabrachial neurons that
pertain to their function and role in sensory valence processing. Resulting data will also bear on how taste
sensations may interact with and modulate pain-related signals in the CNS."

Despite therapeutic advances, ~20% of patients with hypertension have uncontrolled high blood pressure, a
condition that is associated with dysfunction in brain cardiovascular control centers. Therefore, there is a critical
need to understand the neural pathways involved in cardiovascular regulation and how their dysfunction
contributes to high blood pressure. This is particularly important for hypertension that is induced by chronic social
stress, a major problem in today’s world, which involves activation of neuroendocrine and autonomic
mechanisms. Our previous studies using novel genetic mouse models, viral-mediated gene transfer and
optogenetics have revealed angiotensin type-2 receptor (AT2R)-containing neural pathways within the nucleus
of the solitary tract (NTS) as important anti-hypertensive targets. Activation of AT2R-containing NTS neurons
[referred to as NTSAT2R neurons] elicits profound increases in blood pressure; in contrast the AT2R(s) themselves
serve a negative regulatory function, as their activation decreases blood pressure under both normal and
hypertensive conditions. Based on our findings, we have developed the hypothesis that NTSAT2R neurons are a
critical component of the neural pathways that mediate hypertension induced by chronic social stress.
Specifically, we predict that during chronic social stress their activity is driven by excitatory (glutamatergic) inputs
from the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), and that they in turn raise blood pressure via two
mechanisms: Activation of GABAergic NTSAT2R neurons, which are the largest population of AT2R containing
cells in the NTS, elicits baroreflex inhibition; Activation of Glutamatergic NTSAT2R neurons, which project to higher
order brain regions such as the PVN, increases sympathetic outflow and neuroendocrine secretion. We further
predict that selective activation of AT2R(s) present on NTS neurons will offset social stress-induced hypertension
by restoring baroreflex function and normalizing sympathetic outflow and neuroendocrine secretions. Our overall
hypothesis will be tested in three Aims that utilize a novel model of hypertension in mice (Chronic Social Defeat
Stress [CSDS]) along with genetic (e.g., optogenetic and chemogenetic) and pharmacological approaches. Aim
1: Dissecting a specific neural circuit that impinges on and regulates NTSAT2R neurons, will test the specific
hypothesis that PVN inputs to NTSAT2R neurons are necessary and sufficient to promote CSDS hypertension.
Aim 2: Investigating distinct mechanistic roles for GABAergic vs. glutamatergic NTSAT2R neurons in
regulation of blood pressure during hypertension, will test the specific hypothesis that GABAergic NTSAT2R
neurons inhibit the baroreflex, while glutamatergic PVN-projecting NTSAT2R neurons stimulate vasopressin
neurons and sympathetic outflow. Aim 3: Targeting NTSAT2R neurons to alleviate CSDS hypertension, will
test the specific hypotheses that NTSAT2R neurons are necessary for the development of CSDS hypertension,
and that these neurons or AT2R may be targeted to alleviate it. Collectively, these studies will provide mechanistic
insight that may direct development of novel therapeutics to treat hypertension induced by social stress."

The rise in human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has
resulted in a rapidly increasing number of younger and healthier patients being treated with locoregional radiation
therapy (RT). Although effective in curing the cancer, deleterious RT effects upon organs-at-risk (OARs) such
as the salivary glands, swallowing/masticatory muscles, and mandibular bone can result in lifelong
sequelae of RT normal tissue injury such as xerostomia, dysphagia, and osteoradionecrosis (ORN),
respectively. These long-term sequelae in a patient population with good clinical outcomes and extended life
expectancy are increasingly relevant as latent sources of morbidity and mortality in cancer survivorship. Despite
this urgency, a standardized staging and monitoring system to identify patients at risk for developing ORN and
other morbidities, and to assess the effectiveness of interventional therapies, is not currently available.
 At our institution, dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is being
integrated into a multimodality clinical algorithm aimed at improving diagnosis, staging, and surveillance of
disease and toxicity. DCE-MRI can detect altered bone vascularity associated with bone healing, necrosis, and
metastatic involvement, with excellent spatial resolution. Based on our previous NIH-funded research, we
hypothesize that an increase in DCE-MRI parameters (i.e., Ktrans/Ve) at any timepoint more than 3 months
after RT demonstrates increased risk of normal tissue treatment-related toxicity rates. Our objective is to
conduct a biomarker analytic and clinical validation study designed to confirm DCE-MRI parameters as
quantitative imaging biomarkers, with the formal deliverable of an application for FDA Biomarker Qualification at
study completion, via the following specific aims: 1) Prospective qualification and validation of DCE-MRI Ktrans/Ve
as an “FDA BEST-defined” quantitative imaging monitoring biomarker of ORN risk; 2) Investigation of DCE-MRI
candidate biomarkers for pre-qualification as quantitative imaging biomarkers of soft-tissue structures; 3)
Standardization of image acquisition and open source computational/analytic software for orodental DCE-MRI
as a potential component of FDA biomarker qualification.
 Successful completion of this proposal has the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis and management
of late RT-induced morbidities and offer clinicians a reliable and FDA Biomarker Qualification Program
validated biomarker to stratify patients at risk for OARs injury after RT, monitor bone and soft tissue injury and
subsequent oral morbidity, and manage post-RT care appropriately. This work is particularly relevant to NIDCR’s
mission of “advancing fundamental knowledge about dental, oral, and craniofacial health and disease and
translate these findings into prevention, early detection, and treatment strategies that improve overall health for
all individuals and communities across the lifespan”."
10893957,"Acute appendicitis is the most common abdominal surgical emergency in the world, with a lifetime risk of 8.6%
in males and 6.9% in females. In the U.S., acute appendicitis affects > 280,000 individuals and contributes to 1
million patient days of admission each year. Surgical site infection (SSI) rates following appendectomy for
uncomplicated, non-perforated appendicitis remain unacceptably high. A recent review reported pelvic abscess
rates of 9.4% following appendectomy. The highest risks for microbial contamination of the peritoneum occur
when the appendix is transected. Regardless of surgical technique, the retained appendiceal stump ALWAYS
exposes appendiceal mucosa and luminal bacteria to the normally sterile peritoneal cavity. It is thus critical that
optimal antibiotic tissue exposure occurs during this operative risk window.
Antibiotic intervention for acute appendicitis is complex. Therapeutic antibiotics are initiated empirically in the
emergency department, often hours before the appendectomy (usually a 4-18 hour wait). Thus, at the time of
surgery, there are already therapeutic antibiotics on board, and the role of prophylactic antibiotics is unclear.
To date, there has been no consensus on the blended use of therapeutic and prophylactic antibiotics for acute
surgeries, and in many cases, prophylaxis is not administered because therapeutic antibiotics have already
been administered. Unfortunately, in these instances antibiotic tissue levels are likely below the minimum
inhibitory concentration at the time of appendiceal transection due to the short half-life and lack of protocoled
dose timing relative to surgical incision. Consequently, the appendix, a known microbiome reservoir for the
colon, has its lumen open to the peritoneum during appendectomy, guaranteeing some level of tissue and
peritoneal microbial contamination during the surgery, increasing risk for SSI and abscess formation. A more
personalized method of dosing antibiotics in patients with acute appendicitis could reduce SSI risk, limit
unnecessary antibiotic use, reduce overdosing risks, and curb the development of antibiotic resistance.
We hypothesize that personalized antibiotic dosing based on time to surgical appendectomy can
optimize tissue antibiotic exposure at the surgical site, avoid use of unnecessary antibiotics (selective
antibiotic resistance pressure), and reduce toxicity. Our Specific Aims are therefore to 1) characterize the
plasma, tissue and surgical site tissue concentration of therapeutic antibiotics in patients undergoing
appendectomy; 2) design a precision dosing nomogram for therapeutic beta-lactam antibiotics using
quantitative tissue PK-PD modeling and simulation that factors antimicrobial susceptibility distributions, patient
demographics and morphotypes as well as timing to achieve optimal tissue exposure at appendectomy; and
3) pilot and evaluate the effectiveness of a precision blended antibiotic treatment and prophylaxis nomogram
for appendectomy in preparation for future large-scale dissemination by surgical quality collaboratives."
10919799,"Understanding the risks mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) poses for neurodegeneration is critically
important for Veterans. Single and repetitive mTBI is common in Veterans, with as many as 17%
reporting mTBI during deployment. TBI has been reported as one of the strongest environmental risk
factors associated with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and repetitive mTBI has been associated
with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). However, there is ongoing debate as to whether mTBI
outside of sports, which represents the vast majority of brain injuries, results in neurodegenerative
changes. Studies investigating the overlap of AD and CTE, two potentially co-occurring
neurodegenerative conditions, are few and more are needed. This proposal examines the contribution
of mTBI to neurodegeneration with the intent of detecting behavioral and biomarker evidence of
neurodegeneration due AD and CTE in Veterans. Our hypothesis is that, after correcting for age, it is
possible to separate the hallmarks of brain trauma related to TBI itself, from deficits related to
neurodegeneration. [We will examine recognition memory, separating recollection and familiarity as a
model of the cognitive changes underlying potential neurodegeneration in mTBI. As measures of
recognition memory, recollection and familiarity are ideal for use in the mTBI population—at risk for
neurodegeneration—as they have previously been used to detect neurodegeneration in AD. Our
hypothesis is that subjects with more mTBIs and more time since their mTBIs will be more likely to
develop neurodegeneration due to AD or CTE, leading to relative decreases in recollection and,
eventually, decreases in familiarity as well once the disease reaches the mild dementia stage. In
addition to these behavioral techniques, complimentary data regarding the underpinnings of these
cognitive processes provided by event-related potentials (ERPs), MRI, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
will allow further separation of possible AD and CTE. A total of 220 veterans will be recruited consisting
of 65 younger adult veterans with a history of mTBI, 65 older adult veterans with mTBI, 30 older
veterans with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) but lacking a history of mTBI to act as cognitive controls,
as well as 30 younger healthy control veterans without a history of mTBI and 30 older healthy control
veterans without a history of mTBI.] The primary aims will be explored within the mTBI cohort using
regression analyses for the relations between [total number of life time mTBIs], time since [first lifetime]
mTBI, and outcomes of interest including behavioral, ERP, MRI measures and CSF measures.
Multivariate linear mixed-effects models will be used to examine differences between mTBI subjects
and non-mTBI controls for all outcomes measures. The models will be adjusted for age, [education,
APOE status] and other potential confounding factors. The research and career development activities
proposed will prepare Dr. Turk for her long-term goal of a research career in neurodegeneration in
veterans following mTBI and will allow her to eventually study this well-characterized population of
veterans with mTBI longitudinally. She proposes focused coursework, study and mentoring from a
group of well-established investigators who are leaders in their fields, as well as practical research
experience completing the project proposed. The proposed training plan focuses on three objectives:
(1) training in experimental psychology and experimental design including counterbalancing and data
analytic techniques, (2) training in quantitative imaging techniques and data analytic techniques, and
(3) training in cerebrospinal fluid biomarker measurements in neurodegeneration. The knowledge,
techniques, and experience gained through this proposal will allow Dr. Turk to gain skills needed to
compete successfully for a Merit Review Award and become an independent investigator."
10893446,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Childhood behavior problems are a top mental and public health priority. Problem behavior such as
aggression, defiance, and noncompliance emerge as early as 2 years of age and can persist through
adolescence and adulthood leading to long term functional and psychological maladjustment. Children born
very premature (VPT; gestational age at birth < 32 weeks) are twice as likely to demonstrate behavioral
problems as their peers. Despite the risk and occurrence of behavior problems in the VPT population, early
intervention tends to focus on treatment of developmental delays with very few resources for parents to
manage behavior issues. Behavioral parent training (BPT) is an effective treatment for families of children with
problem behaviors. However, little is known about the use of BPT programs for former VPT infants with their
unique medical, developmental, and psychological risk profiles. In addition, system and individual barriers
effect parent access and engagement in BPT. In an effort to address tailored needs of these families and
service barriers, BPT delivery via digital applications and engagement strategies like telephone coaching calls
can provide accessible and tailored approaches to support parents of young children. Currently, there is no
effective, accessible BPT intervention for former VPT infants. The purpose of the study, “Parent training for
parents of toddlers born very premature: A factorial design to test web delivery and telephone coaching” is to
develop a new, accessible and effective form of BPT delivery to address the unmet and unique needs of
parents of VPT children.
 The BPT program proposed in this study is an adaptation of the evidence-based based Chicago Parent
Program (CPP) called the ezParent. The study design is a factorial design to test a hybrid approach of digital
ezParent and telephone coaching calls. Coaching calls are meant to reinforce parent learning and support
tailoring strategies to their child’s developmental level and needs. Parent and child (aged 20-30 months
corrected) dyads will be recruited from two Midwest NICU follow up clinics within Chicago, IL and Columbus,
OH. Parents (n=220) will be randomized to one of four conditions: (1) ezParent+coach, (2) ezParent, (3) Active
Control+coach, or (4) Active Control. We will test the independent and combined effects of ezParent and
coaching calls on parent and child outcomes. We will evaluate the differences in ezParent dose and
engagement with and without coaching calls. Parent and child data will be assessed at baseline, and 3-, 6- and
12-months post baseline.
 Providing low intensity, digitally delivered interventions has the potential for influencing engagement and
address challenges in service delivery for parents of VPT children at higher risk for behavioral problems and
with elevated behavior problems."

The overarching goal for The University of Kansas Cancer Center – Midwest Cancer Alliance Rural
NCORP (KUCC-MCA Rural NCORP) is to enhance capacity for increasing clinical trials accrual and
participation of rural populations in cancer control, prevention, treatment, and care delivery clinical trials, as
well as in other human research developed and conducted by NCORP Research Bases. While cancer affects
all population groups, certain subgroups, including those living in rural communities, are more at risk than
others.[1, 2] Contributing risk factors include older age, inadequate insurance coverage, lower socio-economic
status, minority race, and more isolated geography—all of which can be barriers to receiving specialty
healthcare. Inaccessibility of clinical trials due to geographical barriers clearly disadvantages rural patients and
is their most frequently cited reason for not enrolling in studies.[5] Patients living in suburban areas have the
highest accrual rates to clinical trials, while those by patients living in rural areas is quite low[6, 7]. The University
of Kansas Cancer Center (KUCC) is strongly positioned to enhance clinical trial accrual and participation of
rural populations through its leadership of the Midwest Cancer Alliance (MCA) and its cadre of accomplished
investigators with extensive experience working with rural communities and practices. As the outreach network
of the KUCC, the MCA has partnered with hospitals, cancer centers, and health care providers across the state
of Kansas for over a decade. The goal of these MCA partnerships has always been to extend the reach of
clinical research into under-represented communities, with a focus on rural and low-income communities. MCA
recently expanded to include our state-wide rural primary care practice based research network, Kansas
Patients and Providers Engaged in Prevention Research (KPPEPR), a network of over 75 primary care
providers from across Kansas with a longstanding history of supporting cancer prevention and control research
initiatives. KUCC-MCA Rural NCORP will leverage our over 45-year experience as a SWOG-member, 20-year
experience providing oncology care via telemedicine, 15-year history of successfully conducting research in
rural primary care settings, and 10-year experience opening and running clinical trials within rural health care
networks—all supported by KUCC expertise in partnering with rural oncology and primary care practices to
accomplish our goals. Specifically for the KUCC-MCA Rural NCORP, we will assess institutional, provider,
clinical trial, and patient barriers to trial accrual, and implement processes to: 1) Enhance the infrastructure of
local cancer centers and primary care offices to support clinical trials accrual in rural communities; 2) Expand
access to clinical trials across the MCA network by offering available NCORP clinical trials in local rural
communities; 3) Decrease barriers to clinical trial participation for rural and low-income patients across Kansas
and western Missouri by providing trial participation opportunities in their home communities; and 4) Leverage
KUCC/MCA expertise for addressing rural cancer disparities to clinical trial participation with NCORP grantees."

For the past decade, our laboratory has been studying the role of cellular kinases in intracellular trafficking of
RNA viruses and as targets for broad-spectrum antivirals. Furthermore, we have provided a proof of concept
for the potential feasibility of the host-targeted broad-spectrum antiviral approach by demonstrating that the
inhibition of two cellular kinases, AAK1 and GAK, by novel or the approved anticancer drugs, sunitinib and
erlotinib, protects mice from dengue and Ebola viruses with a high barrier to resistance. Since the therapeutic
index (TI) of this drug combination is narrower for SARS-CoV-2 infection, here, we focus on an independent
class of compounds, the isothiazolo[4,3-b]pyridine-based RMC-113 series, that emerged from our prior work,
but does not inhibit AAK1 or GAK. We showed that RMC-113 and 25 related analogs have potent broad-
spectrum antiviral activity with a high barrier to resistance. Excitingly, RMC-113 reduces SARS-CoV-2 titer to
undetectable levels at non-toxic concentrations and binds PIKFYVE, a cell kinase that regulates endosomal
trafficking. We hypothesize that RMC-113 analogs inhibit both multiple distinct steps in the SARS-CoV-2 life
cycle and the inflammatory response to this virus, in part by targeting PIKFYVE, thereby offering attractive and
safe candidate inhibitors to combat SARS-CoV-2, other pandemic coronaviruses and other emerging viruses.
In Aim 1, we will use a multi-dimensional medicinal chemistry approach to optimize the TI and PK profile of
lead RMC-113 analogs and define their in vitro therapeutic potential as broad anticoronavirus inhibitors. Aim 2
will determine the effect of prioritized analogs and apilimod, a repurposed drug candidate for COVID-19 that
inhibits PIKFYVE, on viral replication, cytokine response and tissue injury in organoids derived from excised
normal lung tissue supplemented with PBMCs from 20 human donors and in two rodent models. Aim 3 will
generate ADME-toxicity and safety pharmacology datasets to select pre-IND candidates. In Aim 4, we will
probe the mechanism of antiviral action of RMC-113. We will validate PIKFYVE as a candidate target and use
an unbiased CRISPRi screen to identify RMC-113’s target(s) and profile its chemical-genetic landscape. In
parallel, we will design a clickable RMC-113 probe to confirm the molecular target via activity-based protein
profiling and to monitor target engagement. Lastly, we will probe functional relevance and specific roles of
PIKFYVE and other candidates emerging via these approaches in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and validate them as
the molecular target(s) mediating the antiviral effect. The predicted immediate impact is that this project will
provide insight into the therapeutic potential and MOA of apilimod, a repurposed drug candidate (beyond the
reported effect on viral entry), and will establish a unique human lung organoid model for studying SARS-CoV-
2 pathogenesis and response to treatment under more natural conditions. In the longer term, successful
completion of our study will deliver a drug-like small molecule candidate designed to protect against resurge of
COVID-19 and to provide readiness for future outbreaks with coronaviruses and other emerging viruses."

Rapid developments in neuroscientific approaches, technologies, and analytics to understand the
pathophysiology and treatment of mental illnesses have resulted in major advances that serve as a strong
base toward the translation of cutting-edge research into personalized treatments for psychiatric conditions. In
order to best leverage these advances, it is imperative that the next generation of researchers in psychiatry
receive focused training that integrates translational research with clinical training. Psychiatric training
programs that provide this focus, in conjunction with dedicated research time, and leadership and related skill
development, are greatly needed. While there is concern in the field of a profound shortage of physician-
scientists being trained, there is also reason for optimism, in that the number of MD/PhD medical school
graduates applying for psychiatric residencies has increased. Our clinical and translational research training
program, Translational Research Activities In Neuropsychiatry (TRAIN) is designed to provide exceptional
training and mentoring to psychiatry residents with the express goal of generating clinical and translational
researchers in psychiatry who will go on to become independent physician-scientists. This program focuses on
the relationship between disruptions in underlying genetics and neurobiology and how they relate to adaptive
behavior, as in the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework, as well as the emergence of
biomarkers that can inform clinical care. The TRAIN program harnesses the expertise and processes our
faculty employ to bridge existing gaps in the field. This includes focused work and expertise in critical content
areas, populations, and settings, as well as the use of approaches that span all ranges of translational science
from the bench to the community. Our structured program provides an exceptional mentoring plan with
experiential opportunities to participating residents coupled with timely didactics. The TRAIN program is
specifically designed to train the next generation of researchers so that they can translate neuroscience and
genetics research into advancements of our understanding of a wide range of mental health problems and
treatments. TRAIN facilitates team science mentoring and training that is needed for translational research,
with an emphasis on productivity through the conduct of a mentored research project, as well as deliverables
such as networking and development of funding proposals to equip trainees for their next steps in training and
academic research. TRAIN also focuses on wellness and guarding against burnout to encourage early
adoption of self-care and enhance resilience."
10922852,"Persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) are understudied and underserved with respect to both dental and
mental health services, compared to the general population. Psychiatric and dental comorbidities in PLWHA
result in diagnostic complexities, treatment gaps, increased health care costs and poorer outcomes. Early
diagnosis and treatment access are imperative. There are no US studies of co-occurring oral diseases and
mental illnesses in PLWHA. Assessment of treatment needs, self-management, and case management can
inform improved referral and treatment outcomes. Studies have identified barriers to dental care in PLWHA,
including ability to pay, dental anxiety, transportation, etc. Patients, HIV program directors, case managers and
administrators are key stakeholders in understanding PLWHA use of dental and mental health services. Their
referral success has not been assessed through traditional HIV surveillance. Factors for successful referral of
PLWHA to mental health and dental services are understudied. Examining linkage factors as perceived by
PLWHA, program directors and other staff, including the role of motivational Self-Determination Theory-based
(SDT) mechanisms is needed. The proposed study will examine factors related to referrals of PLWHA to dental
and mental health services and to describe the prevalence of comorbidities in 105 PLWHA, their self-
management, and their perception of case management. All patients (with or without co-morbidities) will be
assessed. The primary study outcome is keeping dental and/or mental health referral appointments.
AIM 1: To examine referral linkage factors (social, biological, or behavioral) in those screened for 1) oral
diseases only, 2) mental illness only, 3) both oral diseases and mental illness, or 4) neither (comparison
group). Other assessments include 8 key informant interviews (KIIs), 2 focus groups (FGs) with 8-12
participants each and validated surveys.
AIM 2: 2a) To describe the prevalence of comorbidities in a sample of PLWHA, the use of self-management
strategies and their referral need based on screening and clinical data (periodontal inflammation via salivary
biomarker IL-6 at baseline); 2b) To assess feasibility and obtain pilot data to inform a future motivation-based
intervention targeting oral and mental health behavior in PLWHA.
AIM 3: To examine health status at six months via patient screenings, clinical examination with salivary
biomarkers, and a survey.
Hypothesis: PLWHA screening positive for dental/mental comorbidities will keep fewer referral appointments
than those not screening positive. This could be associated with SDT motivational indices for referral and to
linkage factors. This innovative mixed-methods study will inform a needed evidence-base for patients, dental
and mental health professionals and other stakeholders, as well as future studies (e.g., a randomized clinical
trial) and potential interventions such as Motivational Interviewing strategies to maximize successful referrals."
10898708,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Bacterial eye infections cause a significant number of cases of blindness worldwide. Staphylococcus
aureus causes a majority of these infections of the cornea (keratitis) and interior of the eye (endophthal-
mitis). S. aureus produces several adhesins on its surface which aid in tissue attachment, surface components
which trigger innate immune pathways and inflammation, and toxins which disrupt barriers and kill immune
cells. The coordinated synthesis of these virulence factors aids the organism in host survival, and the host is
usually negatively affected. In the eye, this can manifest as a painfully damaged cornea or irreversibly
damaged retina, resulting in significant vision loss. To make matters worse, S. aureus is considered a Serious
Threat on the CDC’s list of Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the US. MRSA and multidrug resistance are now
common in ocular isolates, elevating the risk of ocular infections that are difficult to treat.
 We and others have investigated the pathogenic mechanisms underlying ocular bacterial infections. For
S. aureus, animal infection models and ocular cell lines have been used to investigate the areas noted above.
We have a very good idea of which toxins damage the cornea and retina and which innate pathways are
involved in corneal and intraocular inflammation. This proposal is focused on the factors involved in the
earliest events in S. aureus ocular infections, events that, to date, have drawn minimal attention.
 This new R01 proposal is based on the global hypothesis that coordinated regulation of S. aureus
adhesins and toxins facilitate adherence to tissue, barrier breach, and escape from the acute immune
response. The scientific premise is based on preliminary and published data demonstrating that: 1) adhesins
on the S. aureus surface, when absent, reduce adhesion to corneal cells, 2) leukotoxins, when absent, reduce
virulence in keratitis and endophthalmitis, and 3) S. aureus breach of the blood-retina barrier appears to be
adhesin- and toxin-mediated. These areas are investigated in three separate but related aims focused on early
events in S. aureus keratitis and endophthalmitis. We will use well-characterized S. aureus virulence factor-
defective mutants and feasible in vitro and in vivo infection models in rigorous and straightforward experiments
designed to define the S. aureus factors important in these events.
 For patients with eye infections, ineffective treatment often equates with vision loss. Our approaches to
addressing these gaps in our field are innovative, translationally relevant, and will move the ocular infectious
disease field forward by identifying the S. aureus factors responsible for adhesion to tissue and circumvention
of the acute response, possibly uncovering targets that lead to more rational use or development of
therapeutics for prevention and treatment of infection. These studies are a logical extension of our ocular
infection research program, and we are well positioned to contribute new and important information that will
improve options for preventing infection and preserving vision."

Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) are uniquely positioned to prepare the next generation of
cutting-edge researchers from underrepresented minority groups, but faculty at MSIs still face
several barriers in securing NIH grant funding for their research. Programs such as the Research
Centers at Minority Institutions (RCMI) are aimed at enhancing infrastructure at MSIs to build
and sustain robust research programs, yet persistent barriers to obtaining NIH grants at MSIs
remain. Addressing such barriers (e.g., insufficient number of mentors, limited opportunities for
collaboration, under-utilization of career development awards) is imperative if we are to build a
more diverse biomedical research workforce. To tackle some of these barriers, we formed a
partnership with 9 MSIs and created a program called Leading Emerging And Diverse Scholars
to success (LEADS). The purpose of LEADS was to help launch the research careers of
postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty (hereafter Scholars) with a one-year fellowship where
Scholars received professional skills training such as grant development, team science, and
developing research careers with the ultimate goal of Scholars submitting successful grants.
Over the next five years, we will offer a two-year fellowship to Scholars, focusing on innovative
new components based on feedback from the Scholars and the literature. These include
personalizing the learning and making it experiential, enhancing mentoring, leveraging the
benefits of team science to form research teams, and using the LEADS alumni network to serve
as leaders and near-peer mentors to help Scholars succeed. We believe these elements will
increase the productivity of the Scholars by addressing their unique individual needs and
providing opportunities for success. In addition, we plan to focus on building sustainability at
the MSIs so that the best practices of LEADS can be institutionalized at the partnering sites and
offered across the RCMI network."

Evidence in adults and youth suggests that sleep disturbances precede and predict the onset of depression and
may serve as an important marker of depression. Various types of sleep disturbances, including disruptions of
sleep continuity and abnormal sleep architecture, have been identified as markers of depression in adults, but
have been virtually unexplored as markers of early childhood depression. Early childhood depression symptoms
have become widely recognized as a significant public health concern as they are associated with functional
impairments and heightened risk for depression across the lifespan. However, these symptoms often go
unreported and underdiagnosed because they are difficult for caregivers and clinicians to identify. Research is
needed to identify markers of early childhood depression as early as age 3 years or before, to improve our
capacity for the earliest possible identification of young children struggling with, and at risk for, depression. This
K23 proposal will examine sleep disturbances as a plausible marker of early childhood depressive symptoms in
a prospectively examined sample of young children, oversampled for familial risk for depression. This proposal
leverages an exceptional opportunity to add measures to a NIMH-funded study following a large, high-risk cohort
of mother-infant dyads annually from birth through age 3. This K23 proposal will add comprehensive measures
of sleep (i.e., sleep diaries, actigraphy, and polysomnography) at age 3 years to examine a) which specific
features of objectively measured sleep (during both day and night) at age 3 best correlate with early childhood
depression symptoms, b) whether misalignments in circadian rhythm – “chronodisruptions” – are associated with
early childhood depression symptoms, and c) whether sleep disturbances in infancy and toddlerhood precede
the onset of depression symptoms at age 3. This project has the potential to greatly inform our understanding of
both the sequalae of sleep disturbances in early childhood, as well as identify a plausible marker of early
childhood depression. Completion of the proposed project will provide the applicant with needed training and
expertise in 1) the collection and analysis of PSG data in early childhood, 2) the developmental psychopathology
of early childhood depression, 3) the quantification of chronodisruption in early childhood, and 4) advanced
statistical analysis techniques. A rich training environment and a multidisciplinary team of mentors in each of
these areas is detailed. The described research and training activities will enable the candidate to become an
independent scientist investigating the role of sleep disturbances in the development of psychopathology across
early childhood."

 Progressive retinopathy with vision loss is a unique complication of Long-chain 3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA
Dehydrogenase Deficiency (LCHADD) and mitochondrial Trifunctional Protein Deficiency (TFPD), rare genetic
fatty acid oxidation (FAO) disorders. Gradual macular pigment clumping, followed by progressive deterioration
of the retina occurs in almost all LCHADD patients beginning in childhood and progressing over time. This
manifests initially as decreased night vision, progresses to loss of color vision, and ultimately to decreased
central vision. While early diagnosis through newborn screening and sustained dietary therapy can slow
progression, no successful treatment directed at retinopathy currently exists, and children with LCHADD/TFPD
continue to suffer progressive blindness. Novel treatments for LCHADD-associated retinopathy are needed but
appropriate experimental models have been lacking. We recently created 2 models of LCHADD-retinopathy; a
murine knockin of c.1528G>C, the common mutation in the HADHA gene that causes LCHADD, and cultured
RPE-like cells differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) derived from patients' fibroblasts.
 The pathophysiology of LCHADD-associated retinopathy is not completely understood but begins with
loss of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Two potential molecular mechanisms include; energy deficit due to
decreased FAO to support normal RPE functions, or selective toxicity of accumulating partially oxidized fatty
acid metabolites. Children with lower blood concentrations of LCHADD-specific 3-hydroxy-acylcarnitines have
preserved retinal function implying that retinal damage may be mediated through accumulation of toxic fatty
acid intermediates. If so, then gene therapy directed toward a peripheral organ such as muscle or liver could
lower circulating toxic metabolites, prevent retinal degeneration, and address other LCHADD-associated
complications. Alternatively, retinal preservation may require the restoration of LCHAD activity directly in RPE,
and circulating acylcarnitines are simply a marker of partial FAO in the retina. We will use our 2 models of
LCHADD-retinopathy to test which approach will prevent RPE dysfunction and retinal degeneration.
 LCHADD-RPE exhibit decreased ability to oxidize palmitate, accumulated acylcarnitines and neutral
lipids, and increased susceptibility to H2O2 oxidative stress in comparison to wild type (WT) RPE. We propose
a series of experiments to test LCHADD-associated RPE alterations such as lipid processing and sensitivity to
H2O2 treatment under different FAO conditions compared to WT RPE. Additionally, the LCHADD-mouse has
decreased visual performance and electroretinogram (ERG) responses compared to WT mice. Our goal is to
characterize the visual acuity, retinal structure and function of LCHADD mice and to test the effects of hepatic
versus retinal directed gene therapy approaches. The outcome of these experiments will expand our
understanding of LCHAD-specific pathology and provide the basis for a translational effort to treat LCHADD
retinopathy, potentially with retinal gene therapy, a new treatment modality of which OHSU is a national leader."

10887507,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The elaboration of neural circuits involves a complex series of events, including neuronal differentiation,
settling of neurons in appropriate locations, neural process outgrowth and pathfinding, target selection,
synaptogenesis and synapse refinement. Development of direction-selective (DS) circuits in the mammalian
visual system relies on precise execution of each of these steps, however we are only beginning to understand
how these connections are established. The central goal of this proposal is to understand the molecular
mechanisms that allow components of DS circuits to mediate appropriate visual system responses to
image motion. DS responses depend critically on distinct classes of bipolar cells, starburst amacrine cells
(SACs), and direction-selective retinal ganglion cells (DSGCs). The development of these neurons, including
their differentiation and the regulation of their morphology and synaptic contacts, is integral to the generation of
functional DS circuitry. Here, we propose leveraging our recent gene profiling and additional Preliminary
Findings to address key unresolved questions in DS circuit wiring. Subtypes of DSGCs are tuned to motion in
distinct preferred directions, and this is due to differences in asymmetric wiring of SACs onto the dendrites of
these different DSGC subtypes; however, the underlying basis of this asymmetric SAC-DSGC wiring is
unknown. We have identified genes that are differentially expressed in subtypes of DSGCs that are
components of the Accessory Optic System (AOS): On-DSGCs (oDSGCs) that differ only in their preferred
directional preference–in this case for dorsal vs. ventral object motion. Analysis of these differentially
expressed (DE) genes has the potential to reveal underlying molecular mechanisms governing the
development of these oDSGCs and the synaptic wiring that determines their directional tuning, since the
central difference between dorsal-oDSGCs and ventral-oDSGCs is the polarity of their preferred directional
tuning. This proposal is focused on testing the hypothesis that differential gene expression in oDSGCs
of the accessory optic system (AOS) tuned to detect either upward or downward motion instructs the
development of functional DS circuits."

scientific cores, the enrichment program and work with the Operational Committee to maintain budgetary
oversight and programmatic goals. The communications between the Executive Advisory Committee will also
be a specific responsibility of the Administrative Core. All of this activity can be provided to the External Expert
Panel (EEP) on request. The Administrative Core is to provide guidance and oversight for maintaining
appropriate billing structures within each of the scientific cores and to ensure that funds are spent according to
University and NIH programmatic guidelines. While not a required component of the CIHD, we feel that our
Pilot and Feasibility Program (P&F) has been successful in drawing new people to the field and we propose to
continue the P&F on a limited scale. The Enrichment Program is also administratively managed to support
financial aspects important to ensure that P&F awardees present their findings in concert with other events

The mission of the Center for Chronic Disease Reduction and Equity Promotion Across Minnesota
(C2DREAM) is to support and translate innovative, transdisciplinary research that intervenes on and addresses
racism at multiple levels as a fundamental cause of disparities. Specifically, C2DREAM targets disparities in
cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension, and obesity, hereafter referred to as CVD and RCC (related
chronic conditions), among Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) across a diverse rural-urban
Minnesota region. The C2DREAM Administrative (AD) Core will provide strong, equity-guided governance,
administrative, and communications infrastructure; coordinated data collection of innovative measures of
racism at multiple levels and shared implementation processes; innovative research assessing the
multifactorial relationship between structural and interpersonal, intervention efficacy, and chronic disease-
related behavior change; innovative programming that connects trainees, researchers, community
stakeholders, and policy makers in knowledge sharing and application for change; and equity-oriented rigorous
evaluation to assure center impact. The AD Core’s success will be reflected in the Center’s launch and
sustenance, and seamless integration of all Core activities and research projects. We build on extensive
institutional infrastructure, professional and community relationships, compelling health equity research, and
vibrant intellectual and translational activities across the region. The AD Core embraces a shared leadership
model—reflected throughout the Center—underscoring our belief that health equity will be achieved in
Minnesota only through collective action drawn from strong inter-institutional regional collaboration and multiple
sources of knowledge. Buttressed by strong institutional foundations and enhanced regional networks, the AD
Core will foster C2DREAM’s regional impact in several important ways: (a) Provide the infrastructure,
governance, and leadership to ensure that all C2DREAM components operate efficiently across the region. (b)
Leverage innovative means to assess racism at multiple levels. (c) Augment activities offered by other Cores
to creatively support the productivity of early-stage researchers. (d) Apply robust equity-grounded multimodal
evaluation methods to inform flexible adaptation of our approaches and ensure we achieve the Center’s goals,
and promote exportation of lessons on the most effective elements for use by other P50 centers."
10906141,"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY – Investigator Development Core
There is a critical need to support early-stage investigators (ESIs) researching solutions to well-documented
disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and related chronic conditions (RCC) that disproportionately
burden communities identified as Black, Indigenous and people of color (BIPOC). This work requires direct
participation from the groups most affected, who are traditionally underrepresented in science and medicine
(URSM); unfortunately, URSM investigators often lack institutional resources and structural supports that are
critical for success. To address these needs, the Investigator Development (ID) Core of the proposed P50
Center for Chronic Disease Reduction and Equity promotion Across Minnesota (C2DREAM) has two primary
goals: (1) Administer a pilot grant program that supports and empowers awardees to conduct high-impact
research on CVD and RCC among BIPOC communities across Minnesota. (2) Prepare the next generation of
investigators to conduct multi-level, multi-disciplinary interventional research to address racism and other
social and structural determinants of CVD and RCC disparities. Both goals are undergirded by a focus on
increasing the diversity of the scientific workforce. We have 3 Specific Aims. Aim 1: Facilitate the development
and successful conduct of innovative pilot projects (minimum of 30 projects over 5 years) led by a diverse
group of ESIs aimed at addressing CVD and RCC disparities in Minnesota’s BIPOC communities. Projects will
target one or more of C2DREAM’s priority health disparities populations in Minnesota and CVD or RCC
disparities, be aligned with the C2DREAM conceptual framework, use a multi-level, multi-domain approach
consistent with the NIMHD framework, and include a mentoring plan for the ESI and a plan for community
engagement. Aim 2: Design and launch a robust series of workshops, seminars, networking opportunities and
research resources, called Support and TrAining for Research Success (STARS), to promote preparation,
productivity, and advancement of ESIs. Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness of the ID Core on success of pilot
projects and career development of ESIs. We propose innovative, multifaceted approaches to accomplish our
Aims. The pilot grant program includes a training option (Pilot Incubator Intensive series) to improve unfunded
applications and keep promising investigators in the pipeline. We have engaged >130 faculty from across our
partnering institutions to serve as faculty affiliates for the Center who are committed to serving as mentors and
pilot application reviewers. We will conduct participatory workshops and intensive one-on-one coaching with
ESIs as they develop peer-reviewed manuscripts and future grant proposals, provide networking opportunities
and a suite of resources to support ESIs. The ID Core will have impact by creating a rigorous infrastructure
designed to promote success of ESIs (including postdoctoral fellows, ESIs and community researchers from
other C2DREAM-aligned programs across the region) and improve recruitment and retention of URSM
investigators in the scientific workforce addressing chronic disease disparities."
10906143,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – Community Engagement Core
Community engagement is essential for developing, conducting and disseminating research on the prevention,
treatment and management of chronic condition disparities in BIPOC communities. Despite the 130 billion
dollars invested annually in health research in the U.S., health disparities for racial/ethnic minorities are real,
persistent, and significant in Minnesota and nationally. A portion of this discrepancy may be because of limited
community engagement in designing and conducting research, and limited dissemination of research results to
community, practice, and policy settings. The Center for Chronic Disease Reduction and Equity Promotion
Across Minnesota (C2DREAM) seeks to reduce disparities in cardiovascular disease and the related chronic
conditions of hypertension and obesity experienced by Black, Indigenous and people of color (BIPOC)
communities in Minnesota. C2DREAM will focus on the pressing need to identify ways that racism and
discrimination at interpersonal, structural, and intervention implementation levels function as a driver of
disparities in chronic disease risk and outcomes across BIPOC communities in Minnesota. To support the
success of the goals of C2DREAM a proactive community-engagement infrastructure is needed, co-led by a
coalition of expert regional stakeholders, to develop critical and anti-racist community engagement processes
and disseminate relevant and actionable information and findings to stakeholders across the region.
 The Community Engagement (CE) Core’s overarching goal is to support the activities of C2DREAM by
building the strong foundation of critical and anti-racist community engagement practices needed to
meaningfully address the drivers of disparities in chronic disease risk and outcomes across BIPOC
communities in Minnesota. The CE Core will support the activities of C2DREAM by building a regional
community and academic Coalition to offer guidance and input on engagement and dissemination (Aim 1). We
will then build a strong foundation of critical and anti-racist community engagement practices academic and
community stakeholders (Aim 2). We will guide community engaged informed dissemination throughout
C2DREAM (Aim 3) and finally, using RE-AIM we will evaluate CE Core activities. (Aim 4). Our engagement
and dissemination processes are based on evidence of best practices in knowledge transfer and
communication: that evidence is most likely to be used by the end-users when they are engaged early in the
process, when the evidence is communicated by a credible messenger, and when the evidence is presented in
formats that enhance the likelihood of impact. The CE Core will generate sustained impact by creating an
innovative infrastructure for community engagement and dissemination on research on the prevention,
treatment and management of cardiovascular disease and the related chronic conditions of hypertension and
obesity, particularly in relation to health disparities impacting BIPOC communities."
10883705,"Following productive, lytic infection in mucosal epithelial cells located at the portal of entry in the body, herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) establishes a lifelong, silent infection in sensory neurons. The virus is occasionally reactivated due to weakened immune response or stress causing diseases that range in severity from benign cold sores to encephalitis. HSV-1 contributes to exacerbation of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and facilitates infection by other pathogens such as HIV-1. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released by all types of cells, as they constitute a major mechanism of intercellular communication, and they can influence recipient cell functions. During HSV-1 infection two populations of EVs are readily detectable. The first population is produced through a tetraspanins biogenesis pathway. These are the most abundant EVs released from HSV-1 infected cells, which are enriched in CD63 tetraspanin and carry host factors such as the STimulator of INterferon Genes (STING), a sensor of DNA in the cytosol. These CD63+ EVs can activate innate immune responses in uninfected recipient cells and suppress a subsequent HSV-1 infection. The second population of EVs is produced through the endosomal sorting complex required for the transport (ESCRT) pathway, thus we named them ESCRT+ EVs. These EVs carry ESCRT components along with selected viral tegument and envelope protein and they appear to have a proviral role. In addition to these two population of EVs, earlier studies have reported the production of capsidless particles during HSV-1 infection composed of tegument and envelope proteins but lacking viral genome. These particles are lighter than HSV-1 virions and are known as L-particles. L-particles resemble the ESCRT+ EVs in that they carry viral proteins and have a proviral effect but are denser than ESCRT+ EVs and enriched in viral proteins. We hypothesize that distinct populations of EVs are released during HSV- 1 infection with different effects on the infection. To test our hypothesis, we have formulated three Aims. In Aim 1, we propose to compare the cargo of ESCRT+ EVs and CD63+ EVs with L-particles produced during HSV-1 infection using a mass spectrometry approach. The results of this analysis will generate important information about messages communicated by infected cells. In Aim 2, we propose to determine EV biogenesis pathways involved in the production of ESCRT+ EVs, CD63+ EVs and L-particles during HSV-1 infection. For this, we will use a gene silencing approach to compromise selected EV biogenesis pathways or we will use mutant viruses to determine the impact of selected viral genes on EV biogenesis. In Aim 3, we propose to determine the type of responses that CD63+ EVs, ESCRT+ EVs and L-particles trigger in recipient cells and determine the consequences to the infection. These studies will provide important information on the biogenesis, cargo, and functions of EVs released by HSV-1 infected cells, which are essential to determine their impact on HSV-1 pathogenesis."
10811697,"A promising approach to treat pain is to inhibit peripheral pain-sensing neurons (nociceptors) that are activated
in response to noxious (pain-causing) stimuli. For example, local anesthetics are extremely efficacious at
blocking pain elicited by a variety of pain conditions that arise in the periphery. Unfortunately, local anesthetics
inhibit all sensory, as well as motor, neurons. Our long-term goal is to identify new compounds that specifically
inhibit nociceptors but spare other sensory and motor neurons. Such compounds, especially those that are
peripherally restricted (do not enter the CNS), would be effective and safer analgesics. The immediate goal of
this project, in response to the “Assay Development and Neurotherapeutic Agent Identiﬁcation” R61/R33
FOA, is to develop an in vitro assay to screen natural product libraries for novel and selective nociceptor
inhibitory compounds with much higher throughput than is currently available. We will engineer calcitonin
gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor expressing “sniffer cells” able to detect nociceptor activity. Using co-
cultures of nociceptors (derived from adult rat sensory ganglia from an inflammatory pain model) and CGRP
sniffer cells, we will screen natural product libraries for compounds that inhibit stimulated nociceptor activity. The
use of nociceptors themselves, that are the direct target for newly identified compounds, provides a strong
biological rationale with high likelihood that compounds identified will be efficacious analgesic agents in vivo.
Further, due to high congruence between mammalian nociceptors, the assay will have high translational validity
for efficacy at human nociceptors. The Aims for this application are: Aim 1(R61), engineer sniffer cells that
are highly sensitive to the neuropeptide, CGRP; Aim 2 (R61), develop, validate and optimize a co-culture assay
(CGRP sniffer cells with sensory neurons derived from rats treated with CFA) to assess known compounds that
inhibit nociceptor activity stimulated by a physiological inflammatory soup; and Aim 3 (R33), screen a pre-
fractionated natural product library from the Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) of the NCI to identify
novel compounds that inhibit nociceptor activity. Pre-fractions from the DTP natural products extract library,
which currently consists of over 326,000 fractions, will be tested for selective inhibition of activated nociceptors
using the assay developed in the R61 phase. Positive hits will be those that reduce nociceptor activity by ≥ 25%
without altering fluorescence in sniffer cells (±CGRP) alone. Positive hits will be further refined for nociceptor
selectivity by performing a counter screen for fractions that also inhibit the activity of SH-SY5Y neurons. Bioactive
compounds will be identified from hit fractions through a process of bioassay-guided fractionation in collaboration
with the DTP. These pure compounds will then be assessed for their potency, efficacy and nociceptor specificity
in our assay. We expect to screen ~100,000 fractions (limited only by the budgetary restrictions of the grant) to
identify 5-10 novel compounds with diverse chemical structures that will enter the NIH Blueprint
Neurotherapeutics Network (PAR-20-122) for further development leading to phase 1 clinical testing."
10870165,"Project Summary
Extensive studies have been conducted to define the development, conversion, stability, and regulatory
mechanisms of CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) in homeostasis and a variety of disease models. It is
well-known that Tregs are recruited, converted, and expanded in the tumor microenvironment and act as one
of the major immunosuppressive mechanisms dampening spontaneous tumor-associated antigen (TAA)-
specific T cell immunity and immunotherapy and active vaccination induced anti-tumor immunity. However, how
Tregs behave in the metabolically abnormal tumor microenvironment remains unknown.
The Warburg effect is an important metabolic feature in many types of cancer. Given that nutrients including
glucose are poorly replenished in the tumor, it is assumed that T cell glycolytic metabolism has been altered
due to the Warburg effect in the tumor microenvironment. In support of this, poor glycolysis can alter effector
memory T cell function in the tumor microenvironment. In addition, the oxygen-sensing prolyl-hydroxylase
proteins, necrotic cells released potassium ions, and abnormal zinc metabolism can impair effector T cell
function in the tumor microenvironment. These studies underscore the significance of metabolic regulation of
memory T cells in the tumor.
Tregs exhibit a memory and effector phenotype in the human tumor microenvironment. It is unknown whether
Tregs are subject to glycolytic regulation in the tumor. Furthermore, oxidative stress is an additional metabolic
feature in the tumor microenvironment. Myeloid dendritic cells (DCs) are phenotypically and functionally altered
by oxidative stress in the tumor microenvironment. However, it is unknown whether oxidative stress alters Treg
phenotype and function in the tumor and affects cancer immunotherapy. To address these questions, we have
examined the phenotypic and functional nature of Tregs in human ovarian cancer and several types of mouse
cancer. We have found that Tregs are highly apoptotic in the tumor microenvironment. Interestingly, apoptotic
Tregs are superior suppressors via a distinct mechanism. Furthermore, oxidative stress, rather than glycolysis,
is a metabolic mechanism controlling tumor Treg functional behavior and tempering therapeutic efficacy of
immune checkpoint therapy. This project is to conduct comprehensive molecular, functional, translational, and
clinical research on the nature of Tregs and their metabolic pathway in the cancer microenvironment. We will

Gender diverse youth (GDY) are those with incongruence between their gender identity and sex assigned at
birth. This population faces significant mental health inequities compared to cisgender (not gender diverse)
youth, including increased rates of depression and suicidal ideation. Research suggests that parent affirmation,
or parents supporting their child’s gender identity, can reduce these health inequities, but there are no evidence-
based strategies to help parents affirm their GDY. Being affirming can be challenging for parents, and current
literature indicates that both external experiences, like connectedness and discrimination, and internal
experiences, like fear and stigma, may shape these challenges. Further, there are limitations to existing support
systems for parents including geographical considerations, as most groups or opportunities to meet are in urban
centers, and social pressure, as many parents feel overwhelmed in large group settings. Online support
programs have the potential to overcome these barriers and allow for 1:1 parent peer mentoring, which has
shown success in other pediatric patient populations as well as potential for GDY and their families. However,
there is a need for increased stakeholder-engaged research to understand parent factors associated with being
affirming. Such data are needed to develop acceptable and feasible online support programs that are effective
at aiding parents to affirm GDY. The central hypothesis of this research is that an online 1:1 parent peer support
program will lead to increased parent affirmation and improved health outcomes for GDY. This K23 project will:
1) survey a geographically and racially diverse cross-section of parents of GDY in the United States to better
understand factors associated with being affirming, 2) design a stakeholder-informed online support intervention
featuring 1:1 parent peer mentoring for parents of GDY, and 3) pilot test the online support intervention for
feasibility and acceptability. Conduct of these aims, in addition to a career development plan inclusive of
coursework, workshops, and leadership development, will allow for the applicant’s academic growth in nationally
representative surveys, stakeholder-engaged intervention development, clinical trials, and research program
leadership, and will further advance the applicant’s transition to independence. These aims also will provide the
necessary data to conduct a future R01 randomized control trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the stakeholder-
designed online 1:1 parent peer mentoring intervention to improve parent affirmation of GDY, ultimately helping
to improve health equity for this vulnerable population."
10897035,"Hypertension (HTN) is a highly prevalent, chronic condition which disproportionately affects socioeconomically
disadvantaged individuals and their communities. Individual- and neighborhood-level social risk factors
influence the self-management and access to care essential for HTN control. Mobile health (mHealth)
strategies may contribute to behavioral changes but are largely understudied in disadvantaged communities.
Further, the engagement of the residents of such communities is critical for the successful development and
implementation of contemporary mHealth interventions. This Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career
Development (K23) Award will investigate and develop a participant-informed, mHealth behavioral approach
to individuals living in disadvantaged communities at high risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Specific
aims: (1) Use qualitative assessments to determine how neighborhood deprivation affects HTN control; (2)
Adapt a mHealth intervention to incorporate lifestyle modifications and self-management for individuals living
in adverse community settings using a validated, human-centered design (HCD) approach to adapt the
intervention until we reach participant consensus; (3) Assess the adapted mHealth intervention for feasibility,
as defined by acceptance, usability, and practicality in a randomized-controlled pilot study. The investigations
build on and leverage the core infrastructure of an active, funded health services research program; the
resources of a large, regional health care system; and expert mentorship in qualitative methods, community
engagement, systems science, and clinical trials. Training goals: (1) Integrate the candidate’s prior training
with new methodological tools to examine neighborhood-level social determinants of cardiovascular health; (2)
Cultivate skills in community-informed cohort development; (3) Develop the methodological skills to conduct
rigorous research in chronic disease behavior change; (4) Enhance grant writing, presentation, team science,
and leadership skills to support the candidate’s transition to an independent investigator. As such, the career
development agenda will include synergistic efforts between the candidate’s strengths and future goals. The
proposal advances key objectives of the NHLBI Strategic Vision to address health equity in disadvantaged
communities and the career development of an underrepresented physician-scientist. Expected results: The
project will: (1) Develop and test an innovative, practical, and scalable mHealth intervention program grounded
in behavioral theory and tailored for underserved communities; (2) Develop and refine a model to improve
engagement and satisfaction for mHealth intervention programs using an iterative process; and (3) Collect
preliminary data to inform the design of an R01 application to expand a behavioral intervention tailored for
individuals residing in disadvantaged communities. The research and career development activities outlined in
this proposal will enable the candidate to launch and conduct an independent research career as a future
expert in community-engaged, clinically meaningful interventions to promote cardiovascular health."
10815771,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The non-fluent/agrammatic variant of primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA) is a neurodegenerative disorder
defined by the presence of agrammatic aphasia and/or apraxia of speech that commonly results from a 4-
repeat tauopathy. During the previous 2 cycles of the R01 we used neuroimaging to characterize the patterns
of neurodegeneration and structural and functional breakdowns in connectivity associated with nfvPPA.
However, little is known about how these brain changes are related to, or driven by, underlying biological
processes. Two important biological mechanisms relevant to nfvPPA are deposition of the protein tau and
neuroinflammation. In the 2nd cycle of the R01 we assessed tau deposition in vivo using PET. In the 3rd cycle
we will focus on assessing the role of neuroinflammation and other biological processes. The first aim
of the grant is to characterize the patterns of neuroinflammation in the brain using PET imaging with the 3rd
generation ligand 11C-ER176 and determine whether neuroinflammation changes over time and is associated
with clinical disease severity. The second aim is to determine whether biomarkers of pathological processes
measured from blood plasma, including neurofilament light chain, plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein, tau, and
inflammation biomarkers, are abnormal in nfvPPA. We will also assess whether these biomarkers change over
time and are associated with clinical disease severity. These first two aims will determine whether
neuroinflammation PET and blood plasma biomarkers are useful disease biomarkers in nfvPPA, and we will
determine whether these measures could be useful prognostic markers of future clinical decline. Our third
objective is to build upon knowledge gained from the first 2 cycles and determine how structural and functional
abnormalities in the brain, measured using structural MRI, diffusion tractography and resting state fMRI, are
related to neuroinflammation PET and blood plasma biomarkers. This aim will help model the degree to which
these biological processes relate to other more established breakdowns in brain structure and function. To
accomplish these aims we will recruit 50 patients with nfvPPA, and each participant will undergo three serial
assessments one year apart. At each assessment, patients will have a neurological and speech-language
assessment, 11C-ER176 neuroinflammation PET and a 3T magnetic resonance imaging scan that will include
resting-state functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging sequences. A blood sample will be collected from all
patients at both visits. Blood samples were also collected in the 2nd cycle of the R01 and hence blood plasma
biomarkers will be measured in 100 nfvPPA patients. We will also recruit 50 cognitively normal healthy controls
who will undergo identical neuroimaging and provide a blood sample. This renewal is highly significant as
results gained will be critical to understand the biology of nfvPPA and mechanisms of disease spread.
Furthermore, this work may also help provide potential mechanistic treatment targets for nfvPPA and establish
disease biomarkers for prognosis and for future research studies and clinical trials in patients with nfvPPA."

The staggering prevalence of obesity presents major public health and economic consequences. Effective anti-
obesity drugs are desperately needed to combat the obesity epidemic, as behavioral strategies offer limited
success. Analogs of the endogenous satiety signal glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) suppress food intake and
body weight and are FDA-approved for obesity treatment. However, GLP-1 analogs (e.g. semaglutide) are
burdened by side effects, namely nausea and emesis. Therefore, increasing the therapeutic potential of GLP-1
receptor (GLP-1R) agonists requires characterization of the central mechanisms that mediate both the food
intake-suppressive and nausea/emesis effects of GLP-1. Preliminary data in the rat indicate that GLP-1Rs in
the locus coeruleus (LC), a source of norepinephrine (NE) output in the brain, are pharmacologically and
physiologically relevant for the food intake and illness-like effects of GLP-1. However, the circuit by which
endogenous GLP-1 signaling in the LC contributes to food intake suppression and nausea/emesis remains
unclear. Additionally, the functional relevance of LC GLP-1Rs to the food intake suppressive and
nausea/emesis effects of the semaglutide is not known.
The main goal of the proposed 5- year research career development plan is to facilitate the applicant’s
transition to a tenure-track Assistant Professor with independent R01 funding. To this end, the proposed
research will train the applicant in a variety of approaches to identify the behavioral, cellular, and circuit-level
mechanisms behind LC GLP-1R induced anorexia and illness-like behaviors. Aim I will utilize pharmacological,
chemogenetic and RNAi-mediated GLP-1R knockdown strategies in the rat and musk shrew, a preclinical
model that has an emetic profile similar to humans, to reveal a circuit by which endogenous GLP-1 signaling in
the LC contributes to food intake suppression, nausea and emesis. Aim II will take a translational approach by
determining the real-time calcium signaling dynamics of LC NE neurons to semaglutide as well as the
pharmacological relevance of LC GLP-1Rs to the food intake suppression, nausea/emesis and calcium signaling
evoked by systemic semaglutide. Aim II will use also cutting-edge single nucleus RNA sequencing and
bioinformatic analysis to probe semaglutide-induced changes in the LC NE neuron transcriptome to reveal the
fingerprint of LC neurons and regulation of LC NE neuron genes by semaglutide. Results from these
experiments will inform the development of more efficacious and tolerated obesity treatments and will provide
the applicant with a unique set of skills and pilot data to encourage her transition to research independence."
10818618,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a progressive disease leading to right heart failure and an unacceptably high
mortality rate. Despite major milestones in our understanding of predisposing factors to PH, to date, we still have
limited mechanistic insight into its development and progression. Thus, despite advances in current therapies,
there is no available cure and treatment has limited improvement in outcome. Therefore, development of drug
treatments with alternate targets may benefit patients. To this end, our published and preliminary studies demon-
strate increased activated microglia, specifically TREM2-expressing disease-associated microglia, contribute to
neuroinflammation in autonomic brain regions, particularly the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothala-
mus. These data informed our central hypothesis that activation of resident microglia, especially TREM2+
microglia subtype and infiltrated myeloid precursors, promotes aberrant preautonomic neuronal signal-
ing in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus leading to sustained sympathetic activation,
which is critical to PH. We plan to test this hypothesis via the following three aims: Aim 1 will evaluate the
microglia-dependent mechanisms that contribute to increased preautonomic neuron activity within the PVN; Aim
2 will evaluate the mechanism by which TREM2 contributes to PH pathophysiology, exploring the working hy-
pothesis that TREM2 expression within microglia is necessary and sufficient for augmented sympathetic activity
and thus, a potential therapeutic targeted. Finally, Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that chronic microglia activation
leads to dysautonomia and enhanced systemic inflammation, with consequently increase in circulating myeloid
cells infiltration to autonomic brain regions such as PVN, contributing to neuroinflammation in a feedforward loop,
worsening PH outcomes. Experiments will combine 2-photon microscopy in brain slices, flow cytometry, sympa-
thetic ablation, and several cutting-edge genetic models. Ultimately, we expect results of these studies to con-
tribute to better understanding of the mechanism whereby microglia and infiltrated myeloid precursors contribute
to the pathophysiology of PH. Collectively, the proposed studies will lead to novel information regarding the
brain’s pathogenic contribution to pulmonary hypertension, which may represent an entirely novel target for PH
therapeutics. In addition, strong mentorship by Drs. Andrew Bryant and Eric Krause, as well as a Mentoring
Committee comprised of established professors, who are experts in the proposed techniques and have extensive
mentoring experience; will provide conceptual and methodological training, to achieve the research goals and
prepare me to establish an independent research program."

Chronic cardiometabolic and renal disorders are rapidly growing public health problems in low- and middle-
income countries (LMICs) such as Ethiopia. Responses to chronic conditions in LMICs are limited by a lack of
adequate research capacity and translation of established evidence into practice and policy. Although a great
deal of attention has been given to implementation science, there remains very few funded initiatives to
strengthen the capacity of team science as it relates to implementation and research, and none have examined
chronic conditions. In addition, there are very few mid-to-senior level career mentors in LMICs who can support
individuals and teams to work effectively towards practice and policy changes. We propose to address these
limitations through sustainable multidisciplinary research using implementation and team science in Ethiopia.
Teams from Emory University, Addis Ababa University (AAU) and Bahir Dar University co-designed the
Training on ImplemenTAtioN and team Science for NCD Control (TITANS) program in Ethiopia. This program
will provide a unique opportunity to strengthen capacity within and between higher education institutions in an
urban setting (Addis Ababa University) and a rural setting (Bahir Dar University) in Ethiopia. Within each
institution in Ethiopia, we will bring together a team of researchers from nursing, medicine, and public health
backgrounds to address pressing NCD prevention and control implementation issues across the lifespan using
a team science approach. We will recruit 24 trainees (two per discipline per year, 24 total for four years). The
postdoctoral trainees will spend 4-months on the Emory campus taking selected courses and will develop an
interdisciplinary team science project to be implemented over the following 8-months in Ethiopia with guidance
from in-country and Emory mentors. We will leverage graduates from our other successful D43 training
programs in Ethiopia to provide sustainable in-country mentorship. To strengthen our partner LMIC institutions
from within, we will deliver our successful annual short course on implementation science and team science
that can cultivate organizational management skills. TITANS will better ensure high in-country retention of
trainees by providing stipends, local mentorship, embedding trainee projects in existing platforms, and
motivating a culture of scholarly productivity. This program aspires to facilitate locally driven research that will
shape chronic disease initiatives and policies in Ethiopia."

Our relationship with the physical world is rich, complex, and essential for life. How does the
nervous system encode component dimensions of touch –pressure, texture, vibratory frequency,
adhesiveness, wetness, compliance– and superimpose these with respect to location, direction,
and speed of movement of a tactile stimulus. To understand the neural encoding of touch, we seek
to define the properties and functions of mechanosensory neurons whose mechanosensitive
endings are embedded within the skin as well as the functional organization of the subcortical
touch circuitry. We also investigate development of touch neurons and the subcortical touch
circuitry, embracing the premise that if we know how it’s built, we can better understand how it
works. To achieve our goals, we have generated an array of mouse genetic tools for interrogating
the physiologically distinct classes of Low-Threshold Mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) and High-
Threshold Mechanoreceptors (HTMRs), which collectively mediate our sense of touch. These
genetic tools are the lab’s engine of discovery that enable advanced physiological, anatomical,
molecular, developmental, and behavioral analyses of the mechanosensory system. The goals
of my laboratory during the next eight years, and thus this P35 proposal, are: 1) to elucidate the
properties and functions of LTMR and HTMR subtypes; 2) to define the organizational logic of the
direct and indirect dorsal column pathways; 3) to establish how mechanotransduction contributes
to somatosensory system development; 4) to determine the basis of aberrant touch reactivity in
nervous system disorders; and 5) to train somatosensory researchers and future mentors, with
emphasis on rigor, creativity, collaboration, diversity, and inclusion. Achieving the goals of this R35
will reveal mechanisms of somatosensory neuron development and function, and the central
representation of touch, under normal and disease conditions, and help to prepare the
neuroscientists of the future."

This is an application for a K08 Career Development Award for Jonathan Trujillo, MD PhD, who is a clinical
instructor in the Section of Hematology/Oncology at the University of Chicago. He is building a career as a
physician-scientist focused on identifying immunotherapy resistance mechanisms to improve outcomes for
patients with cancer. His proposed project will determine the role of tumor cell-intrinsic hypoxia-inducible factor
(HIF)-1α and HIF-2α activation in mediating tumor immune evasion and immunotherapy resistance. Cancer
remains the second leading cause of mortality in the United States in spite of intensive treatments. Immune
checkpoint inhibitors have shown impressive and durable clinical responses in some patients, yet the majority of
patients fail to respond to these immunotherapies. Emerging data indicate that increased hypoxia-induced
signaling, which is mediated by the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α and HIF-2α pathways, within the tumor
microenvironment is associated with reduced T cell-based inflammation and resistance to anti-PD-1 blockade.
The impact of tumor cell-intrinsic HIF-1α and HIF-2α activation on the anti-tumor T cell response has yet to be
determined. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that cancer cell-intrinsic HIF-1α or HIF-2α activation
leads to defective T cell priming and ineffective T cell infiltration, thereby promoting tumor immune evasion and
immunotherapy resistance. Novel genetically engineered mouse models of melanoma with conditional
expression of a stabilized variant of HIF-1α or HIF-2α have been generated to determine whether cancer cell-
intrinsic HIF-1α or HIF-2α activation limits the degree of T cell accumulation within tumor tissue and reduces
tumor sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors. The proposed studies will determine whether HIF-1α or HIF-
2α functions by impairing T cell priming and/or by limiting effector T cell infiltration and function in the tumor
microenvironment. Mechanistic studies will be performed to determine whether HIF-1α or HIF-2α pathway
activation results in failure to accumulate and activate dendritic cells required to generate T cell responses,
failure to upregulate chemokines needed for DC or T cell recruitment, aberrant tumor vasculature which can limit
T cell infiltration, or induction of immunosuppressive factors that can impair T cell responses. These data may
provide rationale for the combination of novel HIF inhibitors and immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Dr. Trujillo
has devised a career development plan to accomplish the following goals during this award: 1) develop expertise
in immunologic and genomics techniques and mouse models of anti-tumor immunity; 2) become proficient in
bioinformatics; 3) to expand knowledge in renal cell carcinoma with a focus on immunotherapeutics and novel
HIF inhibitors. He has developed a strong mentoring committee led by his primary mentor Dr. Thomas Gajewski,
an internationally renowned expert in cancer immunology. Thus, upon completion of this proposal, Dr. Trujillo
will emerge as an independent physician-scientist focused on cancer immunology and clinical immunotherapy."
10792473,"Project Summary

The process of selecting an action, evaluating, and storing the outcome to inform future responses requires the basal ganglia (BG) and extended circuits such as the lateral habenula (LHb). Indeed, perturbed LHb activity is observed in multiple human neurological disorders where action selection is impaired. This includes major depressive disorders where disrupted activity patterns in the LHb are causally related to depression-like phenotypes. Despite its critical function in action selection/outcome evaluation, the contributions of specific neuron types within the LHb to these processes in both health and disease remain incompletely understood. Previously, we defined genetically distinct neuronal subtypes within the LHb using whole transcriptome single-cell sequencing. Further, we developed a variation of a 2-armed bandit behavioral task (2ABT) that allows for manipulation and observation of LHb circuit dynamics in vivo. Utilizing these tools, we aim to study LHb activity and contribution to a behavior that requires updating action selection in uncertain contexts based on previous reward history. It is our overarching hypothesis that distinct, genetically defined LHb neuronal subtypes encode the action, the outcome, or both to differentially control action selection behavior. Stress leads to increased errors in decision making in uncertain contexts and stress or depressed patients show decreased learning rates following negative outcomes. Stressed and anxious individuals also show aversion to uncertainty, selecting more certain but less profitable outcomes rather than uncertain outcomes with higher overall profitability. Stress is a major risk factor for depressive disorder development and is known to disrupt LHb activity patterns. Increased norepinephrine (NE) signaling in the brain is a hallmark of stress response, activating in parallel with the HPA-axis contributing to both central and peripheral effects of psychosocial stress. NE stress response is known to differ between males and females. In the LHb, NE is known to contribute to states of both arousal and anxiety. Additionally, we have found differential expression of adrenergic receptors (ARs) in LHb neuronal subtypes. Consequently, we surmise LHb serves as a hub for the interaction of stress, anxiety and depressive disorders during decision making. We further hypothesize that perturbed activity in LHb neuronal subtypes underlie stress induced alterations in action selection. We will examine these hypotheses in 3 aims. In Aim 1A we will determine which genetically defined subfields encode the action, the outcome, or both during a 2ABT. In this way we will define LHb contributions to action selection. In Aim 1B we will utilize the unpredictable chronic mild stress induced anhedonia and the 2ABT to examine how chronic stress affects LHb and NE signaling during action selection. Finally in Aim 2 we will examine specific ARs in the LHb during the 2ABT. During 2ABT tasks, we predict learning of negative outcomes will be encoded by NE signaling in the LHb. Together, these aims will elucidate the mechanism by which the LHb modulates action evaluation in health and under chronic stress in male and females."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related, progressive neurogenerative disease that leads to loss of brain cells
and their connections. The existing literature provides a broad view of AD/ADRD-related molecular changes
from heterogeneous cell populations. However, cell-specific and brain-region specific AD/ADRD-related loss of
cells and connectivity is not yet resolved, particularly at a mechanistic level. In response to RFA-AG-23-028, we
have assembled a strong multi-investigator team across multiple institutions with complementary expertise in
single-cell transcriptomics and epigenomics analysis, neural circuit mapping, and next-generation AD mouse
model development. We will use multiple complementary lines of tau mouse models, in conjunction with APOE
genetic modulation or pathogenic triggers in targeted brain regions. 1) We will use the Tau P301S transgenic
mice on either a human APOE4 knock-in background (TE4) or a mouse Apoe knock-out background (TEKO).
TE4 knock-in markedly exacerbates tau-mediated neurodegeneration, while TEKO mice show largely attenuated
neuronal loss and brain atrophy compared to P301S mice. 2) We will additionally use recently developed novel
humanized Tau mouse models that replace the endogenous mouse MAPT gene with either a normal or
pathogenic variant of the entire human MAPT gene (MAPT gene replacement, MAPT-GR), which express all
isoforms of human tau at physiologic levels and ratios. We hypothesize that vulnerable cell types in early AD-
impact brain regions (locus coeruleus, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampal CA1 and subiculum) show early
maladaptive gene expression profiles and epigenomic signatures that define their molecular vulnerability during
AD/ADRD pathogenesis. To test our hypothesis, in Aim 1 we will apply single-cell epigenomics and
transcriptomics technologies to early AD-impacted brain regions in age-matched control and AD mice, creating
cell-type-resolved multi-omic maps of gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Tauopathy progression
unfolds in an age-dependent manner, thus we will compare control and pathological tau model mice at two
different ages each for different mouse lines (4 months, 10 months for TE and TEKO; 6 months, 12 months for
MAPT-GR lines) based upon their behavioral and neuropathological characterization. In Aim 2, we will use the
multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) technology to generate single-cell
resolution spatial transcriptomic maps for the early AD-impacted brain regions. MERFISH will extend single-cell
omics and spatial genomics to map neural circuits and pathologies at high spatial resolution. In Aim 3, we will
use perform computational analysis to integrate single-cell multi-omics data, image-based anatomical and
molecular gene expression maps from Aims 1-2, acquired from different mouse models at different ages, to fully
characterize the neuronal circuits and AD-vulnerability at cellular level. The proposed research is well aligned
to the RFA goals and is expected to provide new biological insights into AD/ADRD pathogenesis at
unprecedented cellular and spatial resolution."

Hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1) is an autosomal recessive metabolic liver disease that can cause death in
the first months of life and incurs an increased risk of hepatocellular cancer. The current treatment option—strict

eventual IND application if the postnatal clinical trial proves successful."
10833667,"Project summary: Myalgic encephalomyelitis and chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a multisystem
chronic illness characterized by extreme fatigue, muscle weakness, muscle pain, dizziness, a cognitive deficit of
attention, and depression. Despite intense investigation, the molecular mechanism of this disease is still
unknown. Our recent finding suggests that the functional inactivation of ATG13, an essential protein of cellular
autophagy, contributes to the pathogenesis of ME/CFS. To further characterize the role of ATG13 in the
pathogenesis of ME/CFS, a reliable disease model is required that exhibits some of the cardinal disease
symptoms such as post-exertional malaise (PEM) and orthostatic intolerance (OI). PEM is characterized by
severe muscle fatigue and pains immediately after exercise, whereas OI is characterized by the sudden drop in
blood pressure in an upright condition. Our preliminary results suggest that MHY1485, an agonist of mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR), inactivates ATG13-dependent autophagy and induces severe fatigue and PEM in
3-4 weeks old female mice. Therefore, to establish the direct role of Atg13 in ME/CFS pathogenesis, our overall
hypothesis is that atg13 depletion will display a spontaneous PEM pathology. In aim1, we will generate a
mouse strain with muscle-specific knock-out of the atg13 gene (atg13∆muscle). A 20-minute acute treadmill running
protocol and 2-days CPET tests would be adopted in these mice followed by simultaneous measurement of M-
wave amplitude through EMG recording, decreased mobility recorded by Stoelting ANY-maze tracking software,
muscle pain, stress, and neurocognitive impairment of attention (Aim 1.1). Molecular analysis of mitochondrial
impairment in energy metabolism, calcium homeostasis, apoptosis, and anaerobic glycolysis would be evaluated
in these mice (Aim 1.2). Under aim2, we would see if neural mutation of atg13 in myelinating cells of the brain
(atg13∆brain) or ablation of atg13 in sensory neurons (atg13∆PNS) contributes to the pathogenesis of ME/CFS such
as autonomic dysfunction, the cognitive deficit of attention, anxiety, and pain. Briefly, atg13∆brain and atg13∆PNS
mice would be generated and then analyzed for chronic fatigue, followed by a 2-Days CPET test. After another
3-4 weeks, muscle fatigue, pain, stress, and neurocognitive impairment (aim 2.1) would be evaluated. Since
chronic inflammation is one of the cardinal symptoms of ME/CFS, we would assess peripheral inflammation of
CD4 Th1 cell activation in the spleen- and lymph node-derived mononuclear cells (Aim 2.2). Central inflammation
will be assessed by monitoring the activation of NF-κB, iNOS, and RANTES production in the brain and spinal
cord (Aim 2.2). If successful, our current proposal identifies the first mouse model to study ME/CFS and ME/CFS-
associated PEM."

Tuberculous lymphadenitis (TBL) is the most frequent form of extrapulmonary of TB affecting approximately
2000 individuals in Tunisia annually, such that the disease is a clinical burden on the Tunisian health care
system. Since the occurrence of concomitant pulmonary TB in TBL patients is infrequent, and bacilli are rarely
detected by microscopy, TBL represents a form of TB in which the infection is controlled and not yet
disseminated, except in immunocompromised individuals. TBL in Tunisia is generally caused by
Mycobacterium bovis or M. tuberculosis, yet cannot be distinguished clinically, radiographically, or
pathologically. The histologic hallmark of TB is the granuloma, an organized collection of macrophages,
lymphocytes, and other cell types that function to contain and kill invading pathogens. Here, we will test the
hypothesis that elucidation of the cellular and molecular architecture of TBL granulomas will lead to the
identification of disease biomarkers and insight into the mechanisms by which T cell responses regulates
antimicrobial responses in granulomas. We propose to study the cellular and molecular architecture of
granulomas in TBL by integrating single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) with spatial-seq of lymph node
specimens that are obtained as part of routine clinical care. This project brings together scientists from the
Benabdessalem lab at the Institut Pasteur de Tunis (IPT) with scientists from UCLA, who have already
collaborated to generate preliminary data measuring the spatial distribution of cell types and genes in
pulmonary TB and TBL granulomas. In Aim 1, we will determine the cellular and molecular architecture of TBL
granulomas, identifying biomarkers related to antimicrobial responses that correlate with the causative agent,
M. bovis vs. M. tuberculosis, as well as comparing the response in TBL to pulmonary TB. In Aim 2, we will
determine the contribution of T cells to control the infection in TBL granulomas through antimicrobial
responses, including relevant correlates to specific mycobacterial antigens in peripheral blood. Together, these
studies will provide new insight into the mechanisms by which the intersection of T cell responses and
granuloma organization impacts host control of M. bovis vs. M. tuberculosis infection. As such, our studies of
the specific immune biosignatures in TBL will expand our understanding of its immunopathogenesis, leading to
improved care for patients with TBL. An important part of this application is to ensure transfer of technology

 Leishmania parasites cause a suite of devastating Neglected Tropical Diseases that afflict as many as
one million people per year. At least 20,000 are killed each year by the deadly visceral form of the disease,
which is caused by L. donovani. Genetic tools for understanding important questions in Leishmania biology are
currently quite limited. Most Leishmania species lack the capacity for RNA interference (RNAi), which
precludes the implementation of genome-scale RNAi library screens like those that have revolutionized
molecular genetics in the related kinetoplastid T. brucei. As is the case for knocking down protein expression
via RNAi, expressing proteins at higher levels than normal (i.e., overexpression) can confer resistance to drugs
or otherwise enhance survival (Gain-of-Fitness = GnFt), or cause deleterious effects on cell fitness (Loss-of-
Fitness = LsFt) that can reveal important pathways and protein functions. Genome-scale overexpression
libraries have proven valuable for a wide range of genetic screens in multiple species, including T. brucei. The
goal of this proposal is to generate and validate a novel, genome-scale, inducible overexpression library in
Leishmania that will serve as a versatile and broadly applicable new genetic tool for the field.
 We propose to generate a library encoding the majority of L. donovani proteins (~7500 Open Reading
Frames, or LdORFs). PCR amplified LdORFs will be directionally cloned into Gateway Entry vectors to
facilitate transfer of the library to any Gateway compatible vector (Aim 1), resulting in a LdORFeome plasmid
library. The LdORFeome will be transferred into novel inducible Leishmania expression vectors developed in
our lab (Aim 1). The resulting library will be stably transfected into Leishmania to generate an inducible
Leishmania donovani ORFeome overexpression library (the LdOX library). Because the overall goal is to
make the LdOX library available as a resource for the community, we will validate the library by performing
proof-of-principle overexpression screens to identify drug resistance genes (GnFt) and pathways required for
normal growth (LsFt) (Aim2).
 The LdOX library will provide an innovative and much-needed new tool for high throughput genetic
screens in Leishmania. We anticipate that screens with the LdOX library will have a sustained impact on the
field by revealing mechanisms of drug action and resistance, and uncovering proteins and pathways required
for surviving any growth condition or lifecycle stage."
10798292,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) have devastating consequences for the quality of life of affected individuals.
Mild TBI (mTBI) is extremely common affecting approximately 42 million individuals worldwide (NINDS.gov;
2015). Key symptoms include excessive daytime sleepiness, poor memory and attention and psychiatric
symptoms including anxiety [1, 2]. Recovery from mTBI can be uneven with some individuals developing
long-term symptoms [3]. One factor that could underlie variations between individuals in mTBI severity of
symptoms is stress exposure. Stress exposure is common in environments that lead to TBI [4], stress can
exacerbate mTBI outcomes and result in protracted mTBI outcomes While psychological stress resulting
from mTBI can exacerbate symptoms and lead to psychiatric problems [7], the role of prior stress in
increasing vulnerability to subsequent mTBI is less clear [5]. These results suggest that mitigating the impact
of stress could improve clinical outcomes after mTBI. The objective of this proposal is to determine whether
the neuropeptides orexins are neural substrates through which stress exerts its effects. Orexins have
primarily been studied for their role in regulating behavioral outcomes after injury. However, whether orexins
act during prior stress exposure to regulate outcomes of subsequent mTBI is poorly studied. Based on our
preliminary data, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that orexin neuron activity underlies the
effects of chronic stress on mild lateral fluid percussion injury (LFPI)-induced anxiety-related
behaviors and these actions of orexins are sex-dependent. Two Aims are designed to test this
hypothesis. Experiments in Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that mice susceptible to CSDS will
exhibit sex-specific alterations in glutamatergic regulation of orexin neurons after LFPI. Experiments
in Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that reducing orexin activity during stress will promote
resilience and reduce the effects of LFPI on anxiety outcomes. The proposed experiments will provide
important new information on orexin cell activity as a mechanism to reduce the impact of stress on mTBI-
induced anxiety. The experiments bring together the expertise of the PIs in stress neurobiology and mTBI.
The tools and paradigms proposed for use are well-validated in our labs."

Pediatric Critical Care Medicine incorporates a multidisciplinary approach to address the medical needs of the
most fragile population of critically ill and injured children. While current mortality rates at most academic, tertiary
care children’s hospitals are below 5%, certain disease processes, notably sepsis and acute respiratory distress
syndrome which are often accompanied with the presence of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS),
remain associated with significantly higher mortality rates and utilize substantial health care resources. Despite
this, the occurrences of these most challenging diseases do not occur sufficiently often at any one center to
enable an effective, single-site study that will advance both our understanding and management of these
diseases. Mindful of this reality, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human
Development (NICHD) demonstrated great insight and vision in funding an infrastructure to create a multi-center
research network, the Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN). Our Pediatric Critical
Care program at the University of Michigan, and the division Critical Care Medicine at the Children’s Hospital of
Wisconsin and the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) who will participate as our ancillary site, have the
infrastructure to allow us to actively participate in a number of multi-site studies. In addition to possessing this
infrastructure, we also believe both sites have a team of investigators who can make important scientific and
leadership contributions to the field. As a result, we are applying to participate within CPCCRN as a Clinical Site
to assist in executing a large clinical trial investigating the efficacy of GM-CSF in critically ill children with sepsis
entitled, Personalized Immunomodulation in Sepsis-induced MODS. We have the infrastructure and intellectual
capacity to contribute in a meaningful way to the on-going growth and success of this research network that is
committed to improving both the short- and long-term outcomes of critically ill and injured children. The goals of
this proposal are for the Division of Pediatric Critical Care Medicine at the University of Michigan and our partner
ancillary site, the Division of Pediatric Critical Care Medicine at the Medical College of Wisconsin to collaborate
fully with the Executive Committee, the Data Coordinating Center and the other CPCCRN sites. In combination
with our partner ancillary site, our site will provide access to over 100 PICU beds with over 4500 annual
admissions, enabling us to participate fully in the “Personalized Immunomodulation in Sepsis-induced MODS”
trial described in the overall component of this application. Our site proposal has three specific aims to achieve
these goals: 1) to actively collaborate in implementation of the Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research
Network clinical trial, 2) to provide opportunities for young investigators at the University of Michigan, as well as
the Medical College of Wisconsin, to participate in CPCCRN meetings, committees, or trial implementation with
the goal of developing these promising and talented individuals into fundable clinician scientists, 3) to implement
the Personalized Immunomodulation in Sepsis-induced MODS trial."
10890675,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PILOT AND EXPLORATORY STUDIES CORE (PESC)
The overall objective of the PESC is to conduct pilot studies that inform the selection, design, and conduct of
subsequent larger, hypothesis-testing research in the Duke OAIC theme ‘to understand and optimize reserve
and resilience’. The PESC supports studies of physiological reserve at cell, tissue, organ, and individual levels
because each are key contributors to understanding and bolstering resilience at the whole person level. While
this Core supports the crucial, resilience-related pilot work that is needed prior to the stage of intervention (e.g.,
development of measures or model systems), the PESC mentoring approach and OAIC environment trains
awardees to envision and strategize how their line of research will translate into improved human outcomes.
The Specific Aims of the PESC are (1) to advance top quality science related to late-life reserve and
resilience; (2) to attract and nurture a diverse cadre of outstanding investigators equipped to pursue promising
new directions in aging research related to our theme; (3) to build and sustain relationships with critical
stakeholders to maximize the impact and translation of the work conducted through the PESC. To accomplish
these Aims, the PESC partners extensively with other OAIC Cores to extend mentorship and training for
awardees (Research Education Component [REC]), to coordinate a broad solicitation and selection process to
attract and cultivate highly meritorious applications from a wide range of investigators (Leadership and
Administrative Core [LAC]), and to support individual project needs (Molecular Measures Core [MMC], Health
and Mobility Measures Core [HMC], and Analysis Core [AC]). The PESC also leverages institutional
resources including the Duke Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI), the Duke Aging Center, the
Duke Roybal Center, and the Duke REACH Equity Center. Further, the PESC engages stakeholders outside
of Duke University, including community representatives and external reviewers who contribute to project
selection as well as aging research networks that further awardees’ opportunities for career development and
scientific impact and translation. The PESC will support at least three projects each year, leveraging
institutional funding to support additional high caliber pilot projects or smaller-scale “seed” awards. Metrics of
success include attainment of individual project milestones; dissemination of results (presentations,
publications); diversity of the cadre of funded investigators; and use of pilot data to obtain funding for larger,
hypothesis-testing studies."
10894011,"7. Project Summary: LAC
The Leadership and Administrative Core (LAC) will ensure the UM-OAIC provides support for training the next
generation of scientists pursuing research careers in aging, and the conducting of novel research directed by
the UM-OAIC goals of: 1) advancing an understanding of the mechanisms by which exercise, activity-based,
and multi-modal rehabilitation interventions directed at specific functional impairments affect multiple body
systems underlying functional performance and enable functional recovery; 2) developing and testing
interventions to restore function and minimize disability following acute disabling events and gradual declines
related to serious chronic diseases; and 3) preparing junior investigators and more established investigators
new to the field of aging to advance research that promotes health and independence in older adults with
disabling conditions.
 The LAC combines the skills of three leaders (MPIs): 1) Jay Magaziner, PhD, MSHyg, an
epidemiologist and gerontologist, who directs the campus-wide UM Center for Research on Aging
(administrative/contact MPI): 2) Leslie Katzel, MD, PhD, a geriatrician scientist and director of the Baltimore
VAMC GRECC (MPI for medical direction); and 3) Alice Ryan, PhD, an exercise physiologist who works
between laboratory and clinical research (MPI for mechanistic research). These leaders will guide
multidisciplinary investigators in an integrated program that builds on the sciences and therapeutic applications
of exercise, physical activity, and rehabilitation.
 The LAC receives advice on operations, resource allocation, progress, and strategies for expanding
aging research at University of Maryland Baltimore (UMB) from an External Advisory Board of national leaders
in aging research; an Internal Advisory Board of research and administrative leaders at UMB not part of the
UM-OAIC; and a Community Advisory Board of community members interested in the well-being of older
persons. A Research and Education Advisory Panel advises LAC, Pilot and Exploratory Studies Core (PESC),
and Research Education Core (REC) leaders on UM-OAIC’s research training activities, and reviews pilot and
development projects and faculty scholars. Internal and External DSMBs review data quality, patient safety,
and ethical conduct of research.
 The LAC receives outstanding intellectual and financial support from UMB to achieve UM-OAIC
research and research training goals. The LAC fosters ongoing discussion among core leaders and faculty
scholars to ensure research and training are done in a cohesive, coordinated and integrated manner. The LAC
also engages scientists from across UMB so that research and research training can take full advantage of the
breadth and depth of experience and resources available. The LAC aims include: enriching the cadre of
translational scientists pursuing aging research; advancing the careers of junior faculty to become independent
investigators; developing resources to support goals; ensuring independent review of pilot, development
project and faculty scholar applications; and managing the UM-OAIC budget and distribution of funds."
10890677,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Research Education Component (REC)
The overall objective of the REC is to address unmet research training needs and build professional
resilience within the growing community of aging researchers in order to accelerate the discovery and
implementation of interventions enhancing physical resilience in older adults. Leveraging new programs and
collaborations at Duke, REC will intentionally expand the community of translational aging researchers to
include biobehavioral researchers, health disparities researchers, and health services researchers. To build
professional resilience within this community, REC will coordinate an aging research curriculum combined
with multiple opportunities for feedback, networking, and peer support. The curriculum is designed to
enhance competencies in developing complex interventions, recruiting and retaining diverse populations, and
reducing health disparities. (Aim 1). Further, the REC will train and support mentors within the community of
aging researchers to enhance the quality of translational research mentoring across disciplines. To
accomplish this, the REC will adapt an evidence-based mentor training workshop to address specific issues in
aging research. (Aim 2). Finally, the REC will provide mentored research experiences to prepare a diverse
group of aging researchers focusing on physical resilience through Career Development Awards and Pepper
Seed Awards. (Aim 3). All REC programs are based in Social Constructivist adult education theory, with
learners actively engaged in solving complex problems with others across disciplines. Evaluation approaches
assess the level of learner engagement and direct impact of the learning on their research. Recognizing the
critical need to develop and support researchers from underrepresented groups, REC will partner with the
Duke Center for Research to Address Healthcare Equity (REACH EQUITY), the Duke CTSI KL2 program, and
a nearby Historically Black College/University, North Carolina Central University. The ability to leverage
institutional resources will markedly enhance the impact of the REC program. Support by Duke’s leaders is
demonstrated by the commitment for matching funds for REC scholars by the School of Medicine Dean and
Department Chairs, and the funding of the REC-initiated Colloquia by the School of Medicine Dean."
10894018,"7. Project Summary: RC-1
 The UM-OAIC Biostatistics and Informatics Core (RC-1) plays a key role in providing study design and
biostatistics support for the UM-OAIC, and for the coordination and integration of other UM-OAIC Cores in the
conduct of aging research congruent with the mission of the UM-OAIC. RC-1 serves three critical functions to
support research and research training across the UM-OAIC. 1) It serves as the information hub for the UM-
OAIC, providing the ability to track study progress, record and report adverse events, monitor core requests
and core use, and provide regular reports for project leaders. 2) It provides biostatistical and informatics
support for REC Scholars, pilot study awardees and other projects. 3) It contributes to the educational mission
of the UM-OAIC through the REC and other research training initiatives at the university.
 RC-1 is led by John D. Sorkin, MD, PhD, an epidemiologist, biostatistician, and informatics expert, who
has led this Core for the last 20 years; Co-Leader Laurence Magder, PhD, a biostatistician with 35 years of
experience teaching and providing biostatistical support to biomedical research projects; and Co-Leader
Michael Terrin, MD, CM, MPH, an pulmonologist and epidemiologist with >40 years of experience in the design
and conduct of clinical trials. Co-investigators include Michelle Shardell, PhD, and Denise Orwig, PhD. The
expertise of leaders and Co-Investigators is supplemented by other contributors who bring a wide range of
significant expertise to strengthen the research of Scholars, pilot study awardees and UM-OAIC investigators.
 RC-1 biostatistical support includes study design, power calculations, protocol development,
randomization of participants, statistical analysis, interim analysis, providing reports of progress to
investigators, and assistance in the preparation of manuscripts and presentations. Bioinformatics support
includes data repositories, data coordination, designing web-based data capture systems, and data
management. Bioinformatics support for the UM-OAIC infrastructure facilitates the coordination of the flow of
data from multiple investigators and laboratories that contribute to maintenance of a recruitment registry, core
request system, internal tracking database, and adverse event database for reporting to the DSMB, NIA and
regulatory authorities. RC-1 also provides support for participant recruitment and retention.
 RC-1 provides mentoring and training in biostatistics to REC Scholars, affiliated faculty, and
researchers. RC-1 provides support and mentoring through Research Design Studios, Project Initiation
Support Groups and Research Working Groups. Educational and consultative services are also provided to
UM-OAIC junior and senior investigators for the design and implementation of their research. RC-1 will
promote transparency, rigor, reproducibility in research by providing mentoring and education in conjunction
with the REC and PESC. RC-1 also will develop new and innovative statistical methodology to assist UM-
OAIC scientists in the performance of their research."
10894021,"Project Summary: RC-2
 Age-related functional decline is accelerated by acute events by disabling conditions (e.g., stroke, hip
fracture, arthritis, peripheral arterial disease) and chronic disease (e.g., cardiovascular disease, diabetes).
These conditions predispose a multi-system decline that severely reduces functional independence and quality
of life. The overarching goal of the UM-OAIC is to accelerate the development of meaningful interventions to
improve disability related functional declines in older individuals. Evidence from studies by UM-OAIC
investigators and others has linked the benefits of exercise to a reduction in the inflammation and endocrine-
metabolic dysfunction that accompany disabling conditions in the older adults. These works inform our
overarching hypothesis that exercise, activity-based, and multi-modal rehabilitation can improve multiple
physiological systems in older mobility-limited individuals which in turn can improve functional performance,
reduce cardiometabolic disease risk, and prevent functional decline. In this renewal, the RC-2 expands its
clinical outcome measures and extends its support to parallel outcome measures in pre-clinical rodent models.
RC-2 will be led by a multi-disciplinary team made up of Drs. Ryan, Katzel and Ward. Specific Aim 1 is to
advance research focused on the mechanisms of functional decline in older persons with disability and the
mitigation of decline with exercise or activity-based or multi-modal rehabilitation strategies. Specific Aim 2 is to
provide mentoring and training to REC Scholars, affiliated faculty, and UM-OAIC researchers in the
performance of aging research relevant to exercise and rehabilitation-based restoration of function and the
prevention of functional declines in older people with chronic disabling diseases. Through RC-2’s support of
REC Scholars, pilot projects, development projects, and external projects, we will advance the UM-OAIC
mission to reduce disability and restore function in older individuals with disabling conditions and translate our
discoveries toward impactful evidence-based interventions."
10894024,"7. Project Summary: RC-3
Physical impairments, sedentary lifestyle, and chronic conditions such as stroke, hip fracture, arthritis,
Parkinson’s disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus and its vascular sequelae, result in multi-system declines
that precipitate the loss of functional independence and the onset of disability among older adults. RC-3 aims
to improve our ability to prevent and reverse these declines. The central hypothesis of Rehabilitation Science
and Technologies Resource Core 3 (RC-3) is that neuromotor learning-based therapeutics including
rehabilitation robotics will improve sensorimotor recovery and enhance function by mechanisms of activity
dependent plasticity in older Americans with functional limitations and disability. Aims: 1) To develop and
support mechanistic investigations of physical activity and exercise-mediated central and peripheral
neuromuscular adaptations that underlie the neuroplastic mediated improvements in functional performance
produced by rehabilitative interventions and enabling technologies.; 2) To mentor and support REC Scholars
and UM-OAIC investigators in the design, development and implementation of motor learning-based
rehabilitation studies and enabling technologies and the underlying neuromuscular mechanisms to improve
functional outcomes in older persons with functional limitations; and 3) To facilitate translation of UM-OAIC
discoveries across the mechanistic, rehabilitation engineering, applied clinical testing, and technology transfer
phases in order to catalyze transition of discoveries into evidence-based services, products, and tools for
precision rehabilitation. We continue this core’s heritage of investigating models of motor learning and
mechanisms of activity dependent plasticity to enable functional recovery in aging, chronic disease, and
disability. This approach relies on the synergy between RC-3 developing the neuroscience-based motor
learning elements of interventions with RC-2 co-designing the exercise, and joint planning on multi-system
mechanistic studies that converge upon the central and peripheral neuromuscular systems and cardiovascular-
metabolic adaptations that underlie the benefits. We expand beyond but still include prior strengths in
rehabilitation medicine, physical therapy, and balance research by building new bioengineering capacity and
expanding rehabilitative technologies to facilitate innovation at the intersection of these disciplines. Our
approach now leverages multi-level functional and sensorimotor performance assessments, rehabilitation
robotics, and engineering models that rely on joint analysis with RC-1 to advance precision rehabilitation and
produce new technologies that enhance recovery. Technology transfer processes and academic-private
partnerships are introduced to accelerate translation. RC-3 will advance the UM-OAIC mission to reduce
disability and restore function in older individuals and accelerate the translation of science-driven rehabilitation
therapeutics and technology discoveries into evidence-based practice and incorporation into standard
rehabilitative care."

these pathway intermediates or enzyme activities in cells, tissue, whole blood, urine and feces is available to
laboratories nationally. This core is central for many labs that measure these enzyme activities, compounds &
metals in a diverse range of experimental systems. The need for this core is borne out by the fact that it has
served more than 34 different laboratories from 20 research institutions in the past four years via its recharge
system. This core has assayed more than 4000 samples during this time. CIHD investigators are provided
priority access to these services. Core staff members are also available to host training sessions to assist
researchers at all levels in experimental design to leverage the most from Core established methods. We
share our protocols on the CIHD website providing consistency, validation and quality control within our field of

10878959,"CLCs (the “Chloride Channel” family) are anion-selective transporters and channels ubiquitous in
all organisms. Among them, CLC-Ka and CLC-Kb are essential for Cl– and water handling in the
kidney. CLC-Ka is localized to the thin ascending limb, where it helps to establish the steep solute
gradient in the inner medullary interstitium that drives renal water reabsorption. As such, CLC-Ka
is a potential drug target for treating pathologic water retention (hyponatremia) that frequently
complicates the management of patients with hypertension, heart failure, or cirrhosis. A specific
CLC-Ka inhibitor would be invaluable for validating CLC-Ka as a drug target for manipulating renal
water excretion. In this project, we leverage recent breakthroughs to develop selective CLC-Ka
inhibitors. The first breakthrough is our discovery of BIM1, a substituted benzimidazole that
displays >20-fold selectivity for CLC-Ka over its closest homolog CLC-Kb. The synthetic
accessibility of BIM derivatives makes them well suited for further development. The second
breakthrough is the revolution in cryo-electron microscopy, which enables high-resolution
structure determination of challenging targets, including ion channels. A molecular structure of
the BIM/CLC-K complex will identify which regions of the BIM molecule must be retained for
potency/selectivity and which may be modified to improve pharmacokinetic properties. Guided by
this information, we will use a medicinal chemistry approach to develop BIM derivatives with
optimized potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic properties. Optimized BIM derivatives will be
tested for in vivo efficacy."

program of patient-oriented research focused on later-life pain and symptom management. Specific aims I
intend to accomplish over the next funding period include: 1) Developing, testing, and disseminating non-
pharmacologic intervention strategies to improve pain and pain-related outcomes among older adults with a
focus on the use of new technologies when appropriate; 2) Expanding an already existing robust pipeline of
trainees committed to careers in patient-oriented research; 3) Expanding my research focuses to gain further
expertise in and ability to conduct patient-oriented research on: a) cognitively impaired older adult populations
with pain; b) the role of family caregivers in improving pain care outcomes; c) non-pharmacologic approaches
to pain other than behavioral interventions (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy) such as non-invasive neuro-
stimulation techniques (e.g., transcranial direct current stimulation); and d) the development and evaluation of
new pain assessment tools; and finally 4) Obtaining new funding to support research that capitalizes on
recently completed and ongoing research, thereby expanding opportunities to attract and train new mentees
throughout the award period. My mentorship program consists of structured educational and career
development activities A supervised research program tailored to the trainees’ experience, interests, and
needs constitutes the core mentorship activity. This training is supplemented by access to a rich array of
educational and other career building resources and the development of an individualized career development
plan along with regularly scheduled evaluations that help to ensure timely trainee progress and achievement of
mutually agreed upon goals. The Cornell environment offers extensive resources to support the candidate’s
research and mentoring programs and provides a rich array of trainee pipelines. Cornell’s NIA-funded Edward
R. Roybal Center (which I direct) and a postdoctoral training program in behavioral geriatrics research (which I
co-direct) constitute major leveraged resources. Evidence of mentorship success since receipt of K24 funding
in 2016 includes recruiting, training and fostering the career development of 25 trainees, including 5 minority
trainees and 18 women. Evidence of research productivity includes publishing 70 peer-reviewed articles over
this period of time, many in high impact journals, as well as successfully launching the T32 training program
and obtaining competitive renewal funding for Cornell’s Roybal Center (P30 grant). The focus of my ongoing
projects, my proposed career development activities described above, and my continued mentorship of junior
and early mid-career investigators, will help to move the field of later-life research forward, leading to improved
health and well-being of adults adversely affected by later-life pain."
10894120,"Project Summary
 Despite treatment advances over the past several decades, cancer-specific survival for oral cancers
remains bleak, mostly due to the majority of cases being diagnosed at late stages. Early-stage detection of
cancers (most often oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC)) would enable less disfiguring, less costly therapy
with curative intent. However, limitations of traditional visual-tactile examination for oral cancerous and pre-
cancerous lesions have hindered cancer detection and support for screening. Visual inspection for separation
of benign from precancerous or cancerous lesions is inaccurate, and therefore standard practice entails
referral and scalpel biopsy of most potentially malignant oral lesions. Furthermore, approximately 20% of
potentially malignant oral lesions contain some degree of epithelial dysplasia or carcinoma, and therefore early
identification could allow curative treatment as the majority of OSCC typically starts as dysplasia, and the
degree of dysplasia is correlated with the rate of malignant transformation. Detractors of oral screening cite the
high prevalence of benign oral lesions and mild dysplasia as circumstances placing patients at risk of harms
from over-testing and over-treatment. Thus, screening efforts could be transformed by adjunctive diagnostic
tests that offer highly accurate cytopathologic information at the point of care, such as the NIDCR-supported
Point-of-Care Oral Cytopathology Tool. Computer vision-assisted precision imaging tests have recently shown
strong diagnostic performance for oral lesion characterization, but their potential pitfalls and promises must be
thoroughly investigated before clinical application. Similarly, machine learning could bolster optical tests for
visualizing potentially malignant lesions. If successful, these artificial intelligence devices could aid decision-
making, preventing unnecessary scalpel biopsies for low-risk lesions and enabling risk-stratified surveillance or
treatment. Our team of experts in computer disease simulation modeling, machine learning, oral medicine, and
economic evaluation will transform a disease simulation model to provide analysis at the point of care, and
evaluate the different potential uses of precision imaging diagnostics for translation to clinical care. We will
expand our existing disease model of potentially malignant oral lesions to represent lesion characteristics and
clinical risk categories (e.g. based on tobacco and alcohol use) through incorporation of large longitudinal
datasets (Aim 1), in order to evaluate whether artificial intelligence-assisted cytologic testing can improve the
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of screening for low, moderate, or high risk categories (Aim 2). Finally, we
will evaluate whether adjuncts for lesion visualization render favorable effectiveness and cost effectiveness of
screening across risk categories, with or without artificial intelligence support, and develop a user interface for
the model (Aim 3). This work will produce an analytic engine to guide clinical translation of artificial intelligence-
aided diagnostics for oral lesion detection and characterization, to overcome insufficient screening reliability."

collaboration. The Program will create new opportunities for UCSF CTSI Scholars and Faculty to interact with
local and regional CTSA partners through activities coordinated through the West Coast Education Consortium."
10889216,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Induction of immune tolerance is the ultimate goal in the field of organ transplantation. Achieving a state of
tolerance would lead to indefinite graft survival without chronic immunosuppression and its associated
morbidity/mortality and is expected to prevent/reduce of chronic rejection. Tolerance of kidney allografts has
been achieved in non-human primates (NHPs) and in humans by using a combination of nonmyeloablative
conditioning and donor bone marrow transplantation that results in transient mixed hematopoietic chimerism.
However, identical mixed chimerism protocols have failed to induce tolerance in NHP heart allograft recipients.
This reflects the fact that there are organ-specific differences in tolerance induction with kidney (and liver)
allografts being “tolerance-prone” and heart (and lung) grafts being “tolerance-resistant.” Despite the immune
barriers posed by heart allografts, our laboratory has recently developed a novel protocol that has, for the first
time, achieved long-term, stable tolerance of fully MHC mismatched heart allografts in cynomolgus monkeys.
This remarkable result was attained in heart recipients by combining a transient mixed chimerism protocol with
donor kidney cotransplantation which enhanced the contributions of host regulatory T cells (Tregs). Based on
our preliminary data, we hypothesize that promoting the contributions of regulatory T cells and/or
macrophages in recipients undergoing a transient mixed chimerism regimen will induce long-term and
stable tolerance of heart allografts transplanted alone. We will test this hypothesis by 1) augmenting early
host regulatory mechanisms using ex vivo expanded donor-specific MHC-reactive CAR Tregs in lieu of donor
kidneys, 2) enhancing the function and stability of conventional host Tregs and infused CAR Tregs by targeting
the DEPTOR and IL-2 pathways, and 3) using next-generation mTORi-specific nanotherapy to mitigate early
innate inflammation and promote regulatory macrophages. These studies will be complemented by Project 2,
which will test the corollary hypothesis that the development of conditioning regimens capable of inducing
durable mixed chimerism will induce robust tolerance in heart recipients, and Project 3, that will investigate a
novel costimulation blockade strategy to promote Tregs while constraining memory T cells after mixed chimerism
conditioning. By elucidating and differentiating cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying effective versus
ineffective protocols, Core A will inform and refine the treatment strategies proposed in each Project. We
anticipate that together, these highly interactive projects will generate one or more safe and effective mixed
chimerism tolerance protocols that will be ready for clinical trial in heart allograft recipients by the end of the
funding period."
10889219,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Heart transplantation represents the best therapeutic option for patients with end-stage cardiac disease.
However, while one-year success rates are reasonable, heart transplant recipients encounter high rates of
morbidity and mortality, both from allograft rejection and from immunosuppression-associated toxicities. Given
these issues, the ultimate goal is immune tolerance induction, which promises life-long graft acceptance without
chronic immunosuppression. While tolerance to kidneys has been achieved in non-human primates (NHPs) and
in humans with transient mixed chimerism, the same protocols have failed to induce tolerance to heart (and lung)
allografts. Importantly, although lung allografts will not be studied in this Project, our recent findings in lung
recipients provide proof of principle that durable mixed chimerism can be achieved in NHP thoracic allograft
recipients which results in long term tolerance. This represents a major advance. However, this first success
employed agents that are not currently clinically available, and conferred ongoing risks of graft-versus-host
disease (GVHD) and of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder. These data, along with murine studies,
suggest that durable mixed chimerism represents a robust platform for thoracic organ tolerance induction, but
that improved strategies are needed, with a focus on preventing GVHD, preserving protective immunity, and
rapid clinical translation. In this Project, we will address three major hurdles in translating durable chimerism-
based strategies for heart transplant tolerance to the clinic: (A) Controlling graft versus host disease (GVHD)
during chimerism-induction; (B) Developing novel methods of recipient conditioning that are non-genotoxic; and
(C) Inducing chimerism using the safest and most efficiently engrafting subset of hematopoietic stem cells. We
will do so by completing the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: To induce durable mixed chimerism, optimize
Treg homeostasis and preserve protective immunity with OX40L blockade and mTOR inhibition. Specific Aim
2: To develop toxicity-free induction by using antibody-drug conjugate (ADC)-based non-genotoxic conditioning
to induce durable mixed-chimerism and transplant tolerance. Specific Aim 3: To induce durable chimerism with
a highly purified subset of stem cells capable of rapid multilineage engraftment. If successful, this project will
optimize durable chimerism induction strategies for heart allograft tolerance, amenable to immediate clinical
translation."

Ebolaviruses (EBOV) are among the deadliest pathogens known to man, with a case fatality rate of 25–90%
depending on the outbreak. For the first time, monoclonal antibodies Zmapp, Mab114, REGN-EB3 and
Remdesivir (inhibitor of viral RNA synthesis) were used, improving survival rates in Ebola treatment units
(ETU) during the ongoing outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Congo-Kinshasa. Despite treatments, 34%
of EVD survivors experienced eye complications. In addition, they had lower [mean (SD)] minimental test
examination (MMSE) scores i.e. [25 (5.5)] relative to controls [29.9 (0.6)] (p < 0.01); and women perform poorly
[24.8 (5.90] relative to men [28.4 (3.2)](p < 0.01). The odds of depression were higher in EVD survivors [OR:
14.9 (95%CI: 4.4 – 50.1)], mostly in women [OR: 4.4. (95%CI: 2.1 – 9.6)] and, intriguingly, MMSE deficit in
women was associated with higher initial EBOV viral load [OR: 0.84 (95%CI: 0.73 – 0.98, p = 0.03, for one-unit
increase in ctXptNP; lower ctXpt = higher viral load] after adjustment for age and depression status. EBOV
persisted in breastmilk, wet preps, and semen for several months after acute EVD. We propose to test the
hypothesis that occurrence of neuroophthalmologic sequalae is dictated by initial and/or persistence of EBOV
viral load with discernable IgG responses, and/or a persistent inflammatory state driven by elevated cytokines
and immune cell activation; by addressing the following specific aims: Aim 1. To contrast neuro-
ophthalmologic deficits (spectrum & extent) found in confirmed EVD survivors to relevant profiles seen in their
IgG+ but EVD-free close contacts, and IgG- controls (N = 90 per group). In Aim 1A, study participants will
have longitudinal (0, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 month-time-points) assessments of neurocognition using the
computerized Test of Variables of Attention (auditory and visual), the Test of Attentional Performance, and
CogState for nonverbal cognitive skills. In Aim 1B, they will undergo psychophysical tests for visual acuity,
contrast sensitivity, color vision, and visual field; as well as spectral domain-optical coherence tomography to
elucidate structural biomarkers of disease within visual pathways. Aim
differences
levels
overabundance
2 will determine whether group-
on neuroophthalmologic outcomes found in Aim 1 are mediated by EBOV viral load or persistence,
of anti-EBOV IgG, alterations in levels or activation status of circulating immune cells, and/or
of proinflammatory cytokines. Aim 3 will enhance capacity in neurocognitive assessments,
ophthalmologic evaluations and EVD immunoprofiling and molecular biology (RT-PCR). Gaps of knowledge to
be filled include lack of understanding of (1) EBOV persistence, (2) long-lasting immune dysregulation, (3) IgG
positivity with no overt EVD symptoms, all in contexts of post-EVD treatment. The overall goal of the proposed
work aligns with the global health mission of the NIH while integrating the institute-specific missions of FIC,
NEI, NIAID, NINDS, and the Office of Disease Prevention."

This proposal for the competing continuation of the University of Pittsburgh Training Program in
the epidemiology of aging, funded by the NIA since 1989, is focused on the “Epidemiology of
Musculoskeletal Decline and Disability in Aging.” The training program will include 3 pre-
doctoral and 2 post-doctoral positions in epidemiology. Our rich multidisciplinary training
environment is customized to the background of each trainee to address novel approaches in
aging research with an emphasis on cutting-edge biological and physiological methods for
epidemiology, a core discipline for research and practice in public health. Our professional
career development for strong communication and analytic methods, has resulted in trainees
that are actively recruited to postdoctoral and faculty positions within other universities, the
government, and health care. We will continue to train the next generation of research
professionals in aging epidemiology through mentored, hands-on, diverse research experiences
with well-funded leaders in the field, and formal courses. The new focus of our Aims includes: 1)
To apply the biology of aging and longevity to study usual and accelerated age-related
physiologic change with focus in Muscle, Body Composition, Mobility, and Disability;
Osteoporosis and Osteoarthritis; and Falls and Fall Injuries, for the epidemiology of age-related
functional decline; 2) To advance epidemiologic and quantitative statistical methods in aging
studies with a foundation in traditional skills and emphasis on state-of-art techniques; and 3) To
use a multidisciplinary and collaborative approach to epidemiology for specialty areas of Biology
of Aging and Longevity, Health Services, and Diversity, Health Equity and Social Determinants,
in defining targets for active life expectancy and prevention of disability from mid- to late life. To
develop trainee skills to lead investigator-initiated studies, we will create a Recruitment and
Measurement Core. We have several new cohort studies in the field including the Study of
Muscle, Mobility and Aging (SOMMA), a prospective, longitudinal cohort of older men and
women to obtain muscle tissue samples, biomarkers and advanced imaging of muscle related to
risk of mobility disability and another study to relate to these muscle phenotypes with bone
parameters from high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography. We are a field
site for TAME, a new randomized trial of metformin for reducing age-related multi-morbidity and
functional decline. Our training program is uniquely poised to use our existing and new research
in clinical trials and longitudinal cohort studies of aging to elucidate pathways of musculoskeletal
health and physical function, with the goal of preventing disability in the aging population."

The Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center’s Minority/Underserved National Community Oncology
Research Program at Columbia University Irving Medical Center (HICCC/CUIMC/MU-NCORP) has established
a robust infrastructure that facilitates the identification, activation and participation in NCORP Research Base
clinical trials. The overall goal of the HICCC/CUIMC/MU-NCORP is to provide the best in cancer care to the
minority/undeserved population that surrounds our cancer center. The specific aims of our program are to 1)
Provide and enhance access for our community of patients and healthcare providers to a portfolio of NCI Clinical
Trials Network (NCTN/NCORP) trials, specifically in the four components of cancer control, cancer prevention
and screening, cancer care delivery (CCD) research and cancer treatment (Phase I, II, III) as well as tissue
acquisition; 2) Enhance the accrual of minority and underserved patients onto these trials by promoting the
accessibility and availability of the trial portfolio and identifying and reducing accrual barriers to meet the needs
of our community, 3) Lead, participate, and promote NCORP/NCTN research base studies across the cancer
care continuum with a particular focus on studies that reduce healthcare disparities, and 4) Collaborate and
contribute to the NCI NCORP-wide activities. Over the past four years, this strong infrastructure has led to many
accomplishments. Our MU-NCORP portfolio consists of over 150 trials, and we have enrolled over 500 patients
to Cancer Control and Prevention, Cancer Care Delivery and Therapeutic Trials. We have consistently exceeded
the minimum 30% accrual target for minority and underserved patient populations. In addition, we have taken
leadership roles within the research bases and lead many trials. By facilitating the enrollment and participation of
minority and underserved cancer patients into high impactful clinical trials, we will achieve our ultimate goal of
improving survival and quality of life of all individuals regardless of age, race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation
or socioeconomic status."

In response to PA-20-144 calling for innovations in HIV prevention, testing, adherence and retention to optimize HIV prevention and care continuum outcomes, we examine the impact and cost-effectiveness of an innovative multilevel intervention combining Multiple Family Groups (MFGs) for HIV stigma reduction (MFG-HIVSR) with a family economic empowerment (FEE) intervention versus a group-based HIV stigma reduction for Educators (GED-HIVSR) combined with MFG-HIVSR plus FEE (hereafter M-Suubi) on HIV treatment adherence and engagement in care among school-going adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV) in Uganda. HIV stigma remains a formidable barrier to HIV treatment adherence among adolescents in Uganda, contributing to low rates of medication adherence and viral suppression (less than 50%) and high attrition from HIV treatment services. ALHIV experience HIV stigma (internalized, anticipated and enacted) in various settings, including families and schools, the most important developmental contexts that should otherwise be supportive of their development and wellbeing. One of the unique features about education in Uganda and other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa is the high proportion (over 60%) of school-going adolescents enrolled in boarding secondary schools – which represent a form of parental opt-in institutionalized care. ALHIV in schools are more disadvantaged and have lower levels of HIV treatment adherence due to high levels of HIV stigma within schools, rigid school structures and routines, lack of adherence support and food insecurity. Within families, HIV stigma is perpetuated in various forms including discrimination and violence, often due to unfounded fears of infection—hence undermining the quality of family relations and supports for ALHIV. Building on our research and current evidence on HIV stigma reduction, we propose a multi-level three-arm cluster randomized study (M-Suubi) with the following specific aims: Aim 1: Examine the impact of M-Suubi on HIV viral suppression (primary outcome); and adherence to HIV treatment (keeping appointments, pharmacy refills, pill counts), and retention in care (secondary outcome); Aim 2: Examine the effect of M-Suubi on HIV stigma (internalized, anticipated and enacted), with secondary analyses to explore hypothesized mechanisms of change (e.g. depression) and intervention mediation; Aim 3: Assess the cost and cost-effectiveness of each intervention condition; and Aim 4: Qualitatively examine: a) participants’ experiences with HIV stigma, HIV treatment adherence, and the intervention; and 2) educators’ attitudes towards ALHIV, experiences with GED-HIVSR, and program/policy implementation post-training. The study will enroll 840 ALHIV recruited from 42 schools located within the greater Masaka region, heavily affected by HIV (prevalence 12% vs 7.3% national average). M-Suubi will be provided for 20 months, with assessments at baseline, 12, 24 and 36 months. Findings may inform combination intervention efforts to optimize HIV treatment outcomes and engagements in care among ALHIV."

Across many measures, immigrant populations arrive to the US healthier than the general population, but the
longer they reside in the US, the more their cardiovascular risk rises, mediated in part by systemic factors that
promote the adoption of unhealthy behaviors. Given the complex sociocultural forces that influence these
behaviors, a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach is needed to address them. Rochester
Healthy Community Partnership (RHCP) is a CBPR partnership experienced at collectively deploying
interventions with immigrant groups. RHCP tested an intervention of 12 face-to-face modules to promote healthy
behaviors within immigrant populations. At 12 months, there were significant improvements in the primary
outcome of dietary quality compared with controls, suggesting this program could meet the unique needs of
immigrant communities. However, the intervention intensity limits its dissemination potential, and the intervention
did not explicitly address healthful weight loss, nor target overweight or obese participants. Subsequently, a
social network (SN) analysis of 1,301 Hispanic and Somali adults found that obesity and behaviors clustered by
ascertainable SNs. RHCP partners then re-designed existing intervention materials for overweight and obese
adults from immigrant communities to be delivered by peer interventionists within their social networks. The
resultant social network intervention was pilot tested with 4 groups (2 Somali, 2 Hispanic; total N=39); participants
demonstrated significant reduction in weight, blood pressure, and cholesterol as well as improvements in their
dietary quality and physical activity at 3 months (100% retention rate). Building on this, our overall objective is to
foster sustainable health promotion for Southeast Minnesota immigrant communities. The aims of this program
are to 1) assess the efficacy of a social network-informed CBPR-derived health promotion intervention on obesity
and other measures of cardiovascular risk in two immigrant communities; and, 2) assess the impact on
sustainability and uptake outcomes of embedding the intervention within a regional health promotion resource
hub. Using a stepped wedge cluster randomized design, 46 social network sub-groups of adults (23 Hispanic, 23
Somali) with approximately 322 participants (7 per group) will be randomly assigned to receive the intervention
either immediately or after a delay of one year. The intervention will consist of 12 community-based mentoring
and education sessions, followed by 12 maintenance sessions delivered by trained Somali and Hispanic
interventionists to members of their groups in a face-to-face or virtual format. Outcomes measured through 24
months, will be derived from the American Heart Association’s “Life’s Simple 7”: BMI and waist circumference,
blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, physical activity level, and dietary quality. This program
will mobilize the power of SNs for scalable and sustainable solutions to obesity-related behaviors among difficult
to reach populations. CBPR enhances the relevance of this program by targeting sociocultural determinants of
these behaviors."

Tobacco use is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease and related chronic conditions (e.g., hypertension;
CVD & RCC). According to the 2014 Surgeon General’s Report on smoking and health, cigarette smoking
causes about 1 in 4 deaths from CVD. BIPOC communities experience higher prevalence of CVD & RCC
compared to White communities due, in part, to disparities in tobacco exposure. Smoking can be effectively
treated with guideline-recommended cessation counseling and medication, but such treatments are rarely used
and are particularly unlikely to be offered to or used by BIPOC patients. Project 2 of C2DREAM tests the effect
of adding an intervention to promote health equity among BIPOC patients: Longitudinal Proactive Outreach
(LPO; 4 culturally tailored outreach call cycles over one year by a counselor trained in motivational interviewing
to help connect patients to cessation counseling and medication) to the current standard of care, Ask-Advise-
Connect (AAC; primary care providers asking all patients if they smoke, advising smokers to quit, and
connecting smokers to the state quit line through an electronic referral). The proposed Project has 3 aims: A1:
Conduct a randomized controlled trial to examine the direct effect of AAC+LPO (a multilevel health system
intervention) vs. AAC on population-level smoking abstinence at 18 months and treatment utilization among
2000 BIPOC adults. A2: Examine the moderating effects of structural racism and daily interpersonal
discrimination on intervention effectiveness. A3: Use a mixed methods approach to evaluate implementation
outcomes of appropriateness, acceptability, and feasibility of AAC and LPO for BIPOC patients. To test these
aims, we will conduct a hybrid type 1 implementation-effectiveness trial where 2000 BIPOC patients who
smoke across two urban and rural healthcare systems in Minnesota will be randomly assigned to BIPOC
tailored LPO + AAC or AAC alone. Participants will be surveyed at 6, 12, and 18 months post-enrollment to
assess outcomes. The primary outcome is biochemically confirmed tobacco abstinence at 18 months.
Potential treatment mechanisms include increased treatment utilization, perceived behavioral control and
intention to quit. Potential moderators include structural racism in communities and personal experiences of
racism. LPO promotes health equity by addressing barriers caused by structural racism, including access to
care, care fragmentation, and provider racism, by systematically reaching out to all BIPOC patients who
smoke. LPO improves health equity by ensuring that those most at risk for CVD & RCC are offered preventive
care. LPO integrates individual-level treatment with public health approaches to increase treatment
engagement. Further, LPO will be culturally tailored in collaboration with BIPOC communities in Minnesota to
effectively reach and engage the target population."

Urban Native American communities experience significant and persistent disparities in cardiovascular
diseases, obesity and diabetes, and their preventable behavioral precursors, diet and physical activity. This
study implements two multi-level evidence-based interventions (EBIs) Minnesota NET-Works and Stanford
GOALS in partnership with six American Indian after school programs and community-serving organizations in
the Minneapolis, St Paul and Duluth Minnesota. Adoption and maintenance of these programs can be
enhanced and effectiveness strengthened through a structured, evidence-based participatory approach that
tailors the interventions to meet the cultural, organizational contextual, and broader socioeconomic context and
incorporates local innovations. This proposal is poised to achieve these goals through a community-based
participatory research (CBPR).Coalition including the healthcare provider Minneapolis Native American
Community Clinic (NACC, primary care system), Minneapolis and St Paul and Duluth Minnesota School
Districts' Indian Education after school programs (school system), the social service provider Division of Indian
Work's Family Spirit Home Visitation program (social service provider system), departments of public health
and University of Minnesota researchers. The Coalition will use the evidence-based 10-step Getting to
Outcomes (GTO) tailoring and implementation approach to enhance implementation fidelity, reach and
acceptance, and sustainability among the after school programs and community-serving organizations. Native
American organization leadership and program delivery staff will receive mentoring and training in the tailored
EBI curricula and in effective implementation strategies. Implementation strategy effectiveness will be
assessed using a stepped wedge study design. The study uses the Social Ecological Model as its multilevel
intervention framework, and RE-AIM as its implementation process evaluation measurement framework.
Implementation outcomes include organizational leadership support, staff implementation capacity, and
intervention fidelity (program reach, intervention content, delivery, receipt and dose). An important innovative
aspect of the proposed research is its use of evidence-based implementation strategies to strengthen the
capacity of the programs and staff to implement the interventions with broad reach, high participation, and
strong fidelity by aligning with local culture and context. The proposed project will use proven effective
implementation strategies to build program organizational leadership and program delivery staff
implementation capacity to successfully engage urban Native American families in strengths-based, culturally-
grounded programs to promote youth physical activity and healthy eating. Sustained program engagement
among urban Native American families will promote healthy eating and physical activity behaviors that will
reduce future cardiovascular disease risk in this highly burdened community."

The mission of the Deep South Center to Reduce Disparities in Chronic Diseases is to promote health equity
and reduce the burden of cardiometabolic diseases across the “Deep South” region of the United States that
includes Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. A key component of fulfilling this mission is growing and
diversifying the workforce with the expertise necessary to conduct research related to dissemination and
implementation, comparative effectiveness, and translation of evidence-based interventions for real-world
settings. The primary objective of the Investigator Development Core is to prepare and mentor investigators to
develop innovative research that applies a precision public health approach—best viewed as “providing the
right intervention to the right population at the right time”—by paying careful attention to contextual factors at
multiple levels (individual, interpersonal, organizational community, societal). To this end, we have assembled
a trans-disciplinary team of investigators with expertise in translational research from across four academic
partners institutions (the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Pennington Biomedical Research Center, the
University of Mississippi Medical Center and Tuskegee University) as well as community stakeholders
committed to addressing disparities in cardiometabolic diseases in the region. The Directors of the Investigator
Development Core, together with the Center’s co-Directors and other Core Faculty, have created a robust plan
for providing early-stage investigators unique training in translational research methods and access to core
resources dedicated to topics essential for this work. The Investigator Development Core will establish a
competitive pilot studies program that will fund a minimum of six high quality research projects annually, and
will provide grant trainees a mentoring team that will offer strategies and assistance to advance the pilot
studies to competitive grant applications. The Investigator Development Core will also provide access to sub-
units that will provide pilot awardees, as well as the three Center projects, expertise in translational design and
methodology, community participatory research, implementation and dissemination science, cost effectiveness
and assessment of social determinants of health. Ultimately, these activities will yield 30 to 40 early-career
investigators, allow for collaborative and focused cardiometabolic research across Academic/Research
Institutions within the Deep South, and ensure engagement of local/regional community settings. Key
outcomes for this core include publications and extramural grants resulting from the pilot awards, career
trajectories of awardees, and numbers and diversity of applicants."

The mission of the Deep South Center to Reduce Disparities in Chronic Diseases is to promote health equity
and reduce the burden of cardiometabolic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and hypertension, across the
Deep South. The Center will focus on the prevention, treatment and management of cardiometabolic diseases
among Black Americans and low-income populations who suffer disproportionately from these conditions in
this region. The Center is unified thematically through the application of the precision public health approach
across the care continuum to achieve health equity. Precision public health, best viewed as “providing the right
intervention to the right population at the right time”, acknowledges the importance of context, culture,
individual beliefs and preferences to achieve and maintain health equity. This approach also highlights the
need for equitable inclusion of non-academic partners to help translate contextually-relevant research into
community and systems-level interventions. As such, the Community Engagement Core (CEC) of the Center
serves as the central organizing unit for cultivating authentic, productive, and sustaining academic-community
partnerships to promote health equity in the Deep South region. The CEC includes expertise in health
disparities, community-engaged research, place-based research, health promotion, health policy, bioethics,
communications, and research dissemination. The CEC will be led by Dr. Monica Baskin (University of
Alabama at Birmingham) who will be responsible for overall programmatic direction and operations of the CEC.
She will be supported by co-lead, Dr. Caroline Compretta (University of Mississippi Medical Center) as well as
additional faculty responsible for various CEC activities, including Dr. Stephanie Broyles (Pennington
Biomedical Research Center) and Drs. Vivian Carter and Stephen Sodeke (Tuskegee University). Core
leadership will work closely with, and rely on input from, a community coalition comprised of various
nonacademic partner organizations as well as a separate community advisory board including community
members representative of targeted populations for Center research. The CEC will provide integral support for
the Center’s mission to improve health equity and reduce cardiometabolic disease disparities in the Deep
South by: 1) expanding and maintaining bi-directional academic-community regional partnerships; 2) preparing
a transdisciplinary biomedical research workforce for the conduct of community-engaged research; 3)
facilitating novel lines of translational research derived from bi-directional communication between
investigators and community members; and 4) equipping community members with culturally-relevant health
promotion materials, actionable strategies and new resources to improve health and reduce disease burden in
the region."
10884917,"1 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 2 Nearly 3 out of 4 adults in the United States (US) live with overweight or obesity (body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 25
 3 kg/m2), with the highest rates among Blacks, rural residents, and lower socioeconomic groups. Obesity is
 4 associated with cardiometabolic diseases like diabetes, heart disease and stroke, well as multiple cancers. Over
 5 the past decade, trends in obesity have been generally stable for men, but increased significantly among women.
 6 This is particularly true among Black women who have an obesity prevalence of 56.9% compared to 39.8% in
 7 White women. Black women living in rural settings have higher rates of obesity compared to their same race/sex
 8 peers in urban settings. Evidence-based interventions (EBIs) that promote weight loss, healthier diet and
 9 physical activity are effective at slowing the conversion of pre-diabetes mellitus (pre-DM) and hypertension (HTN)
10 to diabetes and heart failure, respectively. However, these interventions are often underutilized by populations
11 at highest risk, including Black women living in the rural Deep South. The mission of the Deep South Center to
12 Reduce Disparities in Chronic Diseases is to promote health equity and reduce the burden of cardiometabolic
13 diseases across the Deep South. Consistent with the Center’s theme (applying a precision public health
14 approach across the care continuum to achieve health equity), this study leverages two EBIs led by our team
15 that have been previously culturally-adapted for the target population and achieved clinically-relevant weight loss
16 and other clinical outcomes (group-based weight loss intervention) along with improvements in diet and physical
17 activity (individual gardening intervention). Combining these EBIs addresses multiple domains (behavioral,
18 personal environment, sociocultural) and levels (individual, interpersonal, community) of influence on risk factors
19 for obesity and other cardiometabolic diseases prevalent in the Deep South. These interventions, delivered by
20 local lay staff and non-academic partners, have a high potential for sustainability; however, there is a need to
21 further evaluate the external validity and implementation-related barriers and facilitators to maximize reach,
22 adoption and implementation. We will employ a pragmatic, multilevel, cluster-randomized, type 1 hybrid
23 effectiveness-implementation trial. A total of 264 Black women (age >30 years) with overweight or obesity and
24 Pre-DM or HTN from 12 rural counties (6 Alabama, 6 Mississippi) will receive either the combined group weight
25 loss intervention (Journey to Better Health; JTBH) plus individual gardening intervention (Harvest for Health;
26 H4H) or the JTBH alone. The specific aims are to compare interventions on: (1) primary outcomes related to
27 implementation effectiveness (reach, adoption, maintenance of health behaviors), (2) secondary outcomes on
28 clinical effectiveness, and (3) cost effectiveness. Findings will inform discussions with coalition partners to
29 achieve our long-term goal of widely disseminating and sustaining multi-level interventions to reduce the multiple
30 chronic disease burden and health disparities in the Deep South."

Type 2 diabetes is a major health concern in the United States, and underserved and minority populations
share a disproportionate amount of the burden. Further, the Deep South has higher rates of obesity, diabetes,
and other chronic conditions than other regions. Modest weight loss can significantly improve cardiometabolic
risk and several health outcomes in patients with diabetes. This study will examine the effectiveness of
integrating primary care with a health coach who remotely delivers care, facilitated by the patient portal of an
electronic medical record (EMR), in Black patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes. We will also assess the
contextual factors of the intervention settings that may influence utilization and dissemination of the weight loss
intervention. The study group will include Black primary care patients aged 18-70 years with obesity and type 2
diabetes. We will randomly assign 352 individuals equally to an EMR-facilitated behavioral weight loss
intervention and a usual care group for 24 months. Patients in the weight loss group will receive a
comprehensive, high-intensity behavioral weight loss program delivered by a health coach using interactive
electronic health (eHealth) technology including video conferencing, with a strong emphasis on bi-directional
communication. Through an EMR patient portal, patients will have access to program materials and
personalized weight loss graphs to track their progress. Patients in the usual care group will continue to
receive routine medical care by their primary care practitioner. We hypothesize that patients in the weight loss
group will have greater and clinically significant percent reductions in body weight compared to patients in the
usual care group. We further hypothesize that patients in the weight loss group will have greater improvements
in secondary outcomes, including fasting plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1c, cardiovascular disease risk factors,
and patient-reported outcomes such as medication use, sleep quality, mobility, dietary intake, physical activity,
and quality of life. Finally, we will study the implementation of the intervention using focus groups, semi-
structured interviews, and cost-effectiveness analysis in order to better understand external validity and
implementation outcomes. The proposed study will significantly advance the translation of evidence-based
weight loss strategies into primary care that are widely applicable to the growing diabetes population in the
United States, particularly in the Deep South."

Deep South states, including Alabama (AL) and Mississippi (MS), have the highest rates of type 2 diabetes
mellitus (T2DM) and some of the worst outcomes due to T2DM-related cardiovascular disease (CVD) and
chronic kidney disease (CKD). T2DM and related cardiorenal diseases disproportionately burden Black
Americans. Over half of the racial health disparities related to T2DM can be attributed to social determinants of
health (SDoH), including reduced healthcare access, poverty, transportation barriers, and food insecurity.
There is a need for effective and sustainable intervention packages that address T2DM-related outcomes and
improve health equity. The overall goal of the Food Delivery, Remote Monitoring, and Coaching-Enhanced
EDucation for Optimized Diabetes Management (FREEDOM) study (Project 3) is to develop an optimized,
multilevel, and scalable intervention to improve T2DM control in low-income Black adults with T2DM and
cardiorenal complications in the Deep South by targeting relevant SDoH. The FREEDOM study will enroll 304
Black adults with suboptimal SDoH through three health systems in AL and MS. A randomized factorial
optimization design using a multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) will evaluate three intervention
components: 1) digital health coaching, 2) food box delivery, and 3) remote patient monitoring (RPM). Thus,
this project will evaluate multilevel interventions that address changes at the individual (patient), interpersonal
(patient-care team communication), organizational (healthcare system–delivered RPM), and community (food
box delivery) levels to improve T2DM management among socially vulnerable Black adults with cardiorenal
comorbidities (CVD or CKD). Aim 1 will identify the combination(s) of the three intervention components that
reduce HbA1c (primary outcome) at 12 months. Aim 2 includes within-trial cost-utility analyses of intervention
components. Aim 3 will identify contextual factors that impact implementation of these different interventions
using a Consolidated Framework for Implementation (CFIR) approach, and the implementation outcomes will
be assessed via the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework.
This study will leverage multi-healthcare system and healthcare system–industry partnerships to develop
optimized, sustainable intervention strategies to improve T2DM outcomes in socially vulnerable Black adults
living in the Deep South."

Maternal and Pediatric Precision in Therapeutics Data, Model, Knowledge, and Research Coordination Center
(IU-OSU MPRINT DMKRCC) will provide expertise in pharmacometrics and clinical trial design relating to
maternal and pediatric therapeutics. The PCTD will also integrate data from the Knowledgebase and Portal Core,
Real World Evidence Core, and other collaborators to support development of pharmacometric models in
pregnant and lactating women and children to provide mechanistic insight into changes in drug disposition and
response across the lifespan and sources of inter- and intra-individual variability. The Aims of the PCTD will 1)
bring together pharmacometricians and clinical pharmacologists with expertise in obstetrics and pediatrics to
contribute to guidelines for data quality, utilize cutting-edge pharmacometric and data science methods (in
conjunction with Knowledgebase Core), and assist in developing and analyzing data from obstetric-pediatric
clinical pharmacology research; 2) Facilitate utilization of data and identification of gaps in knowledge from in
vitro, preclinical, and clinical studies by incorporating this information into integrative physiologically based
pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PBPK-PD) models that encompass dynamic changes in maternal
physiology across gestation and postpartum, including lactation models, link to neonates, and describe
maturation throughout childhood. PBPK-PD models will incorporate critical sources of inter- and intra-individual
variability, including but not limited to pharmacogenomics, obesity, concomitant disease, and disability, to provide
a platform to inform precision therapy in maternal and child health; and 3) Serve as a national and international
resource by enhancing model informed drug development, clinical study design and personalized
pharmacotherapy at various stages of pregnancy and pediatric development through implementation of novel
pharmacometric modeling approaches. The PCTD will work with the MPRINT Hub Steering Committee to set
research priorities and milestones and with the Outreach, Dissemination and Training Core to disseminate
results and provide education on pharmacometric approaches applied to maternal and pediatric therapeutic
research."
10892092,"The Outreach, Dissemination and Training Core (Outreach Core) of the Indiana University-Ohio State

10892100,"Real-World Evidence Core (RWE) - Summary
The Maternal and Pediatric Precision in Therapeutics (MPRINT) Hub will serve as a national resource for
multidisciplinary expertise and knowledge in maternal and pediatric therapeutics. Women and children were
historically excluded from and continue to be under-represented in clinical research studies, leading to a
scarcity of knowledge relating to pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of therapeutic agents in these
populations. The IU-OSU MPRINT will identify data relevant to understanding maternal and pediatric
physiology, pharmacology, and clinical outcomes from literature, public resources, and MPRINT collaborators,
integrate data into pharmacometrics models to enhance knowledge and understanding of drug disposition and
response and support drug development and therapeutics in maternal and pediatric populations.
To accomplish this, the Real-World Evidence (RWE) Core brings together experts and resources from the
Regenstrief Institute (Regenstrief), Indiana University, the Indiana Health Information Exchange (IHIE), and
Information Technology groups across our partner healthcare systems in collaboration with Nationwide
Children’s Hospital and Ohio State University. By leveraging and building upon our team’s expertise and
robust data resources, we will support MPRINT investigators to characterize, study and address research
questions on maternal and pediatric physiology, pharmacology, and clinical outcomes, including social and
disparities issues, with the ultimate goal of enhancing drug safety and efficacy in maternal and pediatric
patients by understanding inter-and intra-individual sources of variability. This environment is essential to
supporting T2 (to patients), T3 (to practice), and T4 (to population) translational research in maternal-pediatric
precision therapeutics, particularly in emerging and multidisciplinary scientific areas.
The Specific Aims of the Core are: 1) Create a collaborative consortium of RWE for the Maternal and Pediatric
Precision in Therapeutics (MPRINT) Hub by providing an effective governance structure and shared
infrastructure; 2) Integrate and facilitate secure and efficient access to diverse, high-quality RWE datasets and
informatics solutions to support and accelerate clinical and translational science in pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics of therapeutic agents in these populations; and 3) Advance informatics innovation,
knowledge, and best practices to accelerate T2 to T4 maternal-pediatric precision in therapeutics.
The Core will bring innovations in many areas in data management and data analytics, technology, clinical and
translational informatics. Led by Drs. Mendonça and Lin, the RWE, will support the MPRINT Center cores, and
all Center members will be eligible to leverage the data and analytic support afforded by the Core."
10920428,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 Nigeria has among the highest burdens of maternal morbidity and mortality, including an estimated 528
(95% uncertainty intervals: 351, 815) maternal deaths per 100,000 lives birth in 2019 (global average: 152 per
100,000). This rate far exceeds the UN Sustainable Development Target 3.1: <70 maternal deaths per 100,000
live births by 2030. Nigeria also has a large and rising burden of noncommunicable diseases, including
overweight/obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular diseases. Unhealthy changes in
dietary patterns and physical activity contribute to these adverse trends, especially during critical life stages,
such as the peripartum period, infancy, and childhood. Improving maternal health behaviors and subsequent
maternal cardiovascular health is a central strategy toward improving family cardiovascular health to blunt and
eventually reverse the rising burden of noncommunicable diseases in Nigeria. Nigeria's National Multisectoral
Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases and National Task Shifting and
Sharing Policy are new and relevant policy frameworks that will be leveraged to improve intergenerational
cardiovascular health among Nigerians in this proposal. The objective of this study is to test effectiveness and
implementation of an adapted HEALTH (Healthy Eating Active Living Taught at Home) intervention on
intergenerational cardiovascular health among 1,000 pregnant women with obesity recruited during the
antenatal period through a type 2 hybrid cluster randomized (1:1) trial implemented in 40 Nigerian primary
healthcare centers. Using the Framework for Reporting Adaptations and Modifications-Expanded, the HEALTH
intervention and its implementation will be adapted from the evidence-based, Parents as Teachers home
visiting model from the US that has been used and validated by Washington University researchers, including
in the NIH-funded ENRICH consortium. We will use a train-the-trainer model including certified trainers to step
down training to community health extension workers and community nurse health educators. The primary
effectiveness outcome will be change in maternal body weight from baseline to 18-month follow-up with >85%
power to detect a between-group of difference of 2.5 kg. Secondary effectiveness outcomes include changes
in maternal cardiovascular health. Exploratory outcomes include changes in infant and child growth. Safety
data will be collected. RE-AIM will guide quantitative and qualitative implementation outcome assessment, and
reach will be the primary implementation outcome with a >50% target of recruiting women with primary school
education or less. Our team of US and Nigerian investigators at Washington University, University of Abuja,
and New York University have collaborated for >5 years with support from 5 active NIH grants. We have strong
support from key Nigerian stakeholders, including at local, state, and national levels. Thus, our proposal is
highly feasible, efficient, likely to succeed, responsive to this funding opportunity, aligned with NIH and GACD
priorities, and will be mutually beneficial to our team members through embedded capacity building."
10853091,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a highly successful human pathogens that infects much of the world’s
population for life. While often asymptomatic, HCMV infections can cause severe disseminated disease in
immunocompromised patients, e.g., transplant recipients, and developmental abnormalities in neonates.
Hence, there is an urgent need for prophylactics to prevent viral transmission, especially from mother to fetus.
HCMV glycoprotein B (gB) is both a key viral penetration protein and a dominant antigen for host defense.
Unsurprisingly, gB is a component of all current HCMV vaccine candidates. However, vaccine efforts are
stymied, at least in part, by an incomplete understanding of gB-specific immune responses. Moreover, the
mechanistic contributions of gB to membrane fusion require further clarification. These gaps in our knowledge
of both gB function and antigenicity largely stem from the reliance of research on the inactive, postfusion form
of gB that cannot adequately recapitulate the active, prefusion form. We have successfully engineered
soluble HCMV gB ectodomain in a prefusion form. Here, we propose to characterize its structure,
antigenicity, and the mechanisms that control its activity. In Aim 1, we will determine the high-resolution
structures of the prefusion HCMV gB and its complexes with known neutralizing antibodies. We will also
stabilize prefusion gB for downstream applications (biochemical research and immunogen development). In
Aim 2, we will isolate and characterize prefusion-gB-specific neutralizing antibodies from HCMV-seropositive
donors. In Aim 3, we will investigate the regulatory mechanism that may restrain gB in its prefusion form. The
proposal is innovative because, to our knowledge, this is the first time the soluble prefusion form of HCMV gB
was successfully engineered. The proposal is significant because it will yield new mechanistic knowledge and
provide new reagents that could aid in the development of optimal vaccines and passive immunization
strategies against HCMV."
10891429,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A subset of emerging, but poorly characterized tickborne diseases in the U.S. are caused by Spotted Fever
Group (SFG) Rickettsia. These obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens cause mild-to-life-threatening vascular
diseases in humans and have a limited set of diagnostics and therapeutic interventions. To promote widespread
disease, SFG Rickettsia species have evolved dynamic strategies to invade host cells, escape into the cytosol,
and spread from cell to cell. We hypothesize that SFG Rickettsia coordinate their complex life cycle by delivering
an arsenal of secreted bacterial proteins (i.e., effectors) that reprogram host cell processes. Unfortunately, the
identity and host targets of these secreted effectors have remained largely unknown. Furthermore, direct analysis
of the secretion systems and putative effectors have been hampered due to challenges in growing and
genetically manipulating these pathogens in the lab. To overcome this barrier, we recently adapted forward
genetics and plasmid-based complementation to the model SFG member Rickettsia parkeri, allowing for
powerful functional-genetic studies of SFG Rickettsia pathogenesis. Using these tools, we discovered that the
secreted effector Sca4 promotes a late stage of cell-to-cell spread by manipulating host cell-cell adhesion.
Additionally, transposon mutagenesis of a secreted effector of unknown function (RARP-1) and a component of
the anomalous Rickettsia Type 4 secretion system (VirB6e) impairs distinct stages of R. parkeri infection. This
proposal will leverage these key advances to examine how a secretion system and secreted effectors promote
different steps of the R. parkeri infectious life cycle. Here, we combine our functional-genetic strategies and
expertise in host cell biology, with modern biochemical techniques to reveal critical, mechanistic insights into
SFG Rickettsia pathogenesis. In Aim 1, we will examine the function and secretome of the T4SS component
VirB6e. In Aim 2, we will determine how the secreted effector RARP-1 promotes R. parkeri infection. In Aim 3,
we will elucidate how Sca4 specifically targets host cell-cell adhesion complexes during R. parkeri cell-to-cell
spread. Collectively, the proposed research will dramatically improve our fundamental understanding of
Rickettsia biology and Rickettsia-host interactions and reveal therapeutic targets to prevent or treat tickborne
diseases."
10866351,"Project Summary
Mounting evidence from our laboratory and others suggests that a lysosomal degradation pathway, called
autophagy, plays a central role in orchestrating inflammation and cancer biology. Recently, our laboratory
generated UVRAG (UV irradiation resistance associated gene) mutant mice that show normal levels of basal
autophagy but are deficient in stimulus-induced autophagy. With this mouse model, we demonstrate that
autophagy dysregulation could exacerbate inflammation and promote spontaneous cancers. However, major
gaps still exist in our understanding of intricate relationship between autophagy, inflammation and cancer,
including 1) what are the mechanisms by which inadequate autophagy perpetuates inflammasome response
and drives inflammation-associated pathologies? and 2) how does basal autophagy suppression affect tissue
homeostasis and promote cancer susceptibility? This project will fill these gaps by focusing on two Specific
Aims, including 1) investigating molecular mechanism of autophagy dysfunction on inflammatory signaling and
inflammation-associated pathologies; and 2) identifying molecular mechanism of autophagy inhibition in Wnt/b-
catenin signaling activation and spontaneous tumorigenesis. These aims will be addressed using
multidisciplinary innovative approaches that integrate state-of-the-art genetic, biochemistry, single cell analysis,
and physiological assays in cells, 3D organoid culture, and mice with targeted mutations in genes related to
UVRAG function and autophagy deregulation. Together, we anticipate that these studies will elucidate the
mechanisms underlying the intricate dialog between imbalance of autophagy, uncontrolled inflammation, and
spontaneous tumorigenesis, thereby providing important new insights into the functional repertoire of
autophagy and facilitating the development of much-needed new strategies for the treatment of inflammatory
pathologies and cancer, particularly those associated with autophagy defects."
10893544,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Although past advances in the field of Anesthesiology have made perioperative medicine remarkably safe for
patients by comparison to historical standards, a myriad of important research questions that hold the keys to
further progress in the allied fields of Anesthesia, Critical Care, and Pain Medicine remain unanswered. These
questions exist in, but are not limited to, the following domains: (1) The mechanisms of action of anesthetic
and sedative medications; (2) The systems biology of the perioperative state; (3) The mechanism and
prevention of postoperative delirium and cognitive dysfunction; (4) Potential toxicity of anesthetic agents in the
developing brain; (5) Maximization of safety related to human factors and communication throughout the
perioperative period; (6) Development and testing of care pathways to improve long-term outcomes after
surgery; (7) Sepsis and other causes of organ failure in intensive care; (8) Mechanisms and treatment of acute
and chronic pain; and (9) Appropriate use of opioids and addiction prevention in the perioperative setting. To
address these and other key questions that have the potential to improve public health, it is critically important
to develop a core of well-trained and highly motivated physician-scientists within the Anesthesiology specialty
who are dedicated to research and academics. The Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine
(ACCM) at the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) is submitting this renewal application for continued support of
Postdoctoral Research Training in Anesthesiology (PRTA). In addition to providing an avenue for the support
of Trainees, this program will continue to refine the approach whereby ACCM recruits talented and diverse
young scientists engaged in Anesthesiology research and trains them via rigorous career development plans
under the guidance of expert Faculty Mentors. Our principal aim is to develop the next generation of physician-
scientists by endowing them with the tools and techniques best suited to their research while fostering
innovation and the highest standards of scientific rigor. This aim is accomplished through a strong
departmental research infrastructure that operates in conjunction with the incredible breadth and depth of the
broader JHU scientific enterprise. Appointments are for two years, and key activities are mentored research
and the potential for further education in the form of a relevant master's degree. As demonstrated in this
application, ACCM has a long and productive history of clinical, translational, and basic research training in
Anesthesiology, which the PRTA will continue to build upon and improve. Our previous success is highlighted
by the career progression and scientific accomplishments of past Trainees, and our ongoing capacity to fulfill
the mission of this Program is apparent in our outstanding pool of current and potential Trainees. We request
continued funding for six Trainees per year for the so that we can continue to develop physician-scientists who
will contribute to a secure scientific future in the field of Anesthesiology."
10932111,"Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is the leading cause of nonrelapse mortality
following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT). Once the diagnosis is made, a
fundamental practice gap remains the determination of whether disease is stable or progressing.
Clinical trials of promising new potential treatments are limited by the lack of reproducible and sensitive
measures of cGVHD severity.
 Skin is central to cGVHD evaluation because it is the most commonly involved organ. Features
are divided into erythema (visualized changes) and sclerosis (palpated mechanical changes). This
project will implement an objective, longitudinal monitoring approach to cGVHD by combining 3D digital
photography, machine learning, and biomechanical assessment with the Myoton device. These
technologies look at and feel skin analogously to a clinical exam, but in a precise and quantitative
fashion. The hypothesis of the proposed research is that this integrated technological approach will
reliably detect clinically important changes in disease severity. This will provide the opportunity to
overcome the shortcomings in existing methods, enabling quantitative assessments to validate and
guide therapy.
 Aim 1 will test the reliability and reproducibility to quantify erythema body surface area with 3D
photography and deep learning. A large patient image data set will be created to optimize and test the
reliability of a deep learning convolutional neural network to independently identify, demarcate and
grade regions of erythema. Aim 2 will test the reproducibility of biomechanical assessment of skin
sclerosis with the Myoton, a handheld commercial device that is widely used to noninvasively measure
biomechanical and viscoelastic properties of muscle. Aim 3 will evaluate the ability of the integrated
quantitative approach to measure clinically meaningful changes in cGVHD severity in a year of follow-
up of a prospective cohort of cGVHD patients.
 The proposed neural-network assessment of erythema and skin biomechanical assessment
with Myoton are each significant innovations, which can later be applied to a broad range of other
progressive cutaneous diseases. The proposed work is significant because it addresses the inability to
accurately measure cGVHD severity and treatment response, which is currently the fundamental barrier
to permanent successful treatment by HCT of hematologic malignancies and other diseases."
10888323,"While dietary sugars can alter the bacteriophage community in the gut ecosystem, the underlying mechanisms
driving these changes remain elusive. Until we have filled these voids in our knowledge base, we will not be in
a position to comprehend the interplay between dietary sugars, and probiotics and their viruses; this hampers
the development of rational approaches to use diet to promote the efficacy of (engineered) probiotics. The long-
term goals are (i) to unravel the mechanisms that drive the interplay between diet, and probiotic bacteria and
their viruses, and (ii) to develop microbial therapeutics. The objectives of this research program are (1) to eluci-
date the mechanisms by which sucrose promotes phage production in the probiotic gut symbiont Lactobacillus
reuteri, and (2) to exploit diet-induced phage production to promote colonization and the release of therapeutics.
The overarching hypothesis is that sucrose increases phage production, which consequently promotes coloni-
zation and the release of recombinant proteins from engineered probiotics. The rationale of the work proposed
is that its successful completion is expected to result in a paradigm shift of our understanding how diet impacts
phage production, which will open up new and exciting avenues to modulate the gut microbiota composition,
promote probiotic growth, and to tailor therapeutic delivery. The overarching hypothesis will be tested by pursuing
three specific aims: (1) To characterize the sucrose metabolism pathway in relation to phage production; (2) To
determine the role of phage on L. reuteri gut fitness in response to a diet enriched in sucrose; and (3) To use
dietary sugar to control phage-mediated lysis and therapeutic delivery. In the first aim, targeted mutagenesis is
used to dissect the sucrose metabolism pathway and their products to determine the triggers of sucrose-driven
phage production in L. reuteri. Under the second aim, bacterial competition assays in gnotobiotic mice will de-
termine the ecological ramifications of sucrose-driven phage production; isogenic mutants with reduced ability
to metabolize sucrose, and to produce phage, are expected to reveal causation. Under the third aim, L. reuteri
will be engineered to lyse—and release recombinant interleukin-22—in response to metabolism of a specific
sugar. In an animal model of fatty liver disease therapeutic efficacy in response to diet will be investigated. This
research is innovative because an important mutualistic gut symbiont is used to unravel the mechanisms by
which sucrose boosts phage production in the gut ecosystem, which can be applied towards the development of
next-generation probiotics. The research is significant because understanding how a dietary sugar boosts phage
production in the gut ecosystem, and what the ecological ramifications are, opens up previously unexplored
opportunities to alter the composition of the gut microbiota, which may include enrichment and/or engraftment of
probiotic bacteria. Also, after we have demonstrated that a dietary sugar promotes the release of a recombinant
therapeutic protein, a foundation is created for a realistic prospective to regulate therapeutic release in the gut
using dietary or environmental triggers that activate phage-mediated lysis."
10876273,"This project will evaluate longitudinally collected physiological metrics, with a focus on autonomic nervous
system function (heart rate variability [HRV]), using wearable devices. It will investigate the ability of these
physiological metrics to identify and predict symptomatic ulcerative colitis (UC) flares. It will explore the
modifiability of these metrics through a HRV directed biofeedback intervention and its impact on UC symptoms.
Candidate: The primary objective of this application is to support the development of Dr. Robert Hirten into an
independent patient-oriented researcher in the field of digital health and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
research. Dr. Hirten’s career goal is to be an independent researcher and leader in leveraging the dense
physiological data acquired through novel wearable technologies in IBD research. Dr. Hirten’s proposed training
activities are in five areas: (1) Advanced statistical methodology, (2) Digital health, (3) Clinical trial design, (4)
Behavioral intervention science, (5) Career development. To achieve these goals Dr. Hirten has assembled a
mentorship team led by Dr. Bruce Sands, Chief of Gastroenterology at The Mount Sinai Hospital who has
expertise in longitudinal and clinical trial research in IBD. Environment: The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount
Sinai has a strong tradition of research and is a top 20 medical school in NIH funding. The Mount Sinai Division
of Gastroenterology is a top 10 division in the country by US News and World Report and is a leader in IBD
research and clinical care. The Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai is an international
institute with expertise in data science, biomedical and digital engineering. Research: UC is a chronic
inflammatory disease affecting the colon with symptomatic flares characterized by diarrhea, blood per rectum
and abdominal pain. Flares are frequent, occurring in at least 30% of patients per year, and are associated with
morbidity and impaired quality of life. Current methods to identify and predict flare are suboptimal and limited. If
flares can be identified earlier and predicted strategies for mitigation or prevent could be instituted. Advances in
digital and wearable technology allow for collection of continuous, non-invasive physiological parameters
potentially linked with disease activity. Therefore, our specific aims are to (1) To determine the association of
physiological metrics, including HRV, with symptomatic flare in UC, (2) To assess the predictive ability of
physiological metrics, with a focus on HRV, for the development of symptomatic flare in UC, (3) Determine the
feasibility, acceptability, and effect size of a HRV biofeedback intervention in subjects with symptomatic UC. To
accomplish this we will perform a longitudinal cohort study enrolling 160 subjects with UC in remission and follow
them for 12 months or until flare, collecting physiological indices from a wearable device (Apple Watch) and
survey metrics from a smart phone application. In addition, we will perform a HRV directed biofeedback
intervention in 23 subjects with UC and symptomatic flare. The general approach and skills acquired during this
award can be applied to future R01 grants aimed at building upon the findings from this work."

SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and changes in public health funding priorities. Our central hypothesis is that
retention in the HIV care cascade and treatment outcomes are influenced by patient-level demographic,
clinical, developmental, and behavioral factors, as well as, factors within the ambient health care and broader
contextual environment. We will leverage our strengths, including robust working relationships with HIV
treatment programs, a substantial harmonized regional database, plus broad experience in sampling-based
methodologies and novel analytical approaches. Over the course of this research we will: SA-1: Describe
movement through the HIV care cascade with a focus on identifying broader and health care environment
contextual factors that influence optimal retention in care and viral suppression, in the face of global disruption
due to the COVID-19 pandemic and changes in donor funding priorities. The Post COVID-19 Double-Sampling
Cohort (Post COVID) will address the impact of broader contextual factors (COVID-19) while the Telehealth
and Structural Adaptations project will address the impact of health care structure. SA-2: Examine the impact
of developmental stage and behavioral factors on retention in the cascade and subsequent outcomes. The
multiregional Adolescent and Young Adult Network of IeDEA (AYANI) and regional Measuring Adverse
Pregnancy and Newborn Congenital Outcomes (MANGO) cohorts will assess the impact of developmental
stage on the cascade, while the Syndemics cohort will address the impact of mental health on the cascade.SA-
3: Examine the immediate and long-term outcomes of people diagnosed with Tuberculosis (TB) with a

10818530,"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Survivors of adolescent and young adult cancers (AYAs) are a vulnerable and underserved subgroup of survivors
at increased risk for long-term health effects, including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, additional
cancers, and frailty. Furthermore, over half of AYAs already have overweight or obesity and obesogenic lifestyle
behaviors are common among AYAs, which exacerbates their cardiometabolic risk. Given that obesity is
associated with poorer outcomes in cancer survivors, there is a critical need for weight management
interventions—yet, no weight loss interventions have been developed to meet the unique needs of AYAs. Extant
research, including our own preliminary data, indicate that AYAs prefer tailored interventions (both with respect
to developmental stage and cancer context) that are delivered remotely via website or app. Thus, we propose to
develop a 6-month mHealth weight management intervention designed specifically for AYA cancer survivors and
test its efficacy in a randomized controlled trial. The intervention will be rooted in self-determination theory in
order to bolster intrinsic motivation for health behavior change by enhancing perceived competence, relatedness,
and autonomy. It will include evidence-based behavioral weight loss strategies adapted for AYA survivors (e.g.,
simplified dietary self-monitoring, adaptive goal-setting, tailored feedback on progress) as well as personalized
dietary and physical activity goals. The intervention will be paired with digital monitoring tools (wireless scale and
activity tracker), as well as access to a closed Facebook group to foster peer support. AYA survivors nationwide
(N=240, diagnosed between ages 15-39 [current age 18-39], posttreatment, body mass index [BMI] 25-50kg/m2)
will be randomized to one of two arms: 1) mHealth intervention as described above, or 2) self-guided (digital
tools + health education + Facebook). Randomization will be stratified by BMI, sex, and race/ethnicity.
Assessments will occur at 0, 3, 6, and 12 months. Percent weight change at 6 months (primary outcome) will be
assessed using a remote collection protocol via video weigh-in and wireless scale to facilitate enhanced reach
across the US. Secondary outcomes in the full sample include frailty (frailty index), objectively measured physical
activity (ActiGraph GT9X Link), dietary intake (ASA24), and quality of life (SF-36), as well as questionnaires
assessing hypothesized psychosocial mediators targeted by the intervention. A subsample of participants (n=80)
will complete in-person visits at each clinical site at 0, 6, and 12 months to assess changes in body composition,
waist circumference, frailty, and biomarkers of aging and cardiometabolic disease. We hypothesize that
compared to the self-guided arm, AYAs in the intervention arm will manifest greater percent weight loss at 6
months and better maintenance of weight loss from 6 to 12 months. We also will examine the psychological and
behavioral mechanisms of action to inform future optimization efforts, and explore demographic and clinical-
related moderators of intervention response. Our findings will accelerate the development of effective remotely-
delivered mHealth weight loss interventions to improve outcomes and reduce the burden of morbidity in AYAs."

The use of benzodiazepines, an addictive yet commonly prescribed class of drugs in the US, is independently
linked to serious health outcomes, including falls and fractures. Benzodiazepines are also frequently involved
in opioid-related overdoses, underscoring their relevance in the ongoing US opioid epidemic. Benzodiazepine
coverage restrictions and other regulatory actions have been implemented in the past to reduce
benzodiazepine use and related harms, though the intended and unintended impact of these actions remains
unclear. One such restriction with national implications was the exclusion of benzodiazepines coverage for
Medicare enrollees during the implementation of Medicare Part D in 2006. At the same time, the Tennessee
Medicaid (TennCare) program instituted a restriction on benzodiazepine coverage for all enrollees. TennCare
was the only State Medicaid program in the country to do so. Thus, TennCare enrollees (including dual-
eligibles) did not have benzodiazepine coverage from either Medicaid or Medicare from 2006 through 2013,
when the restriction was partially removed, and then completely removed in 2014. This intermittent restriction
and subsequent reintroduction of benzodiazepine coverage is unique to TennCare enrollees and provides the
setting for a natural experiment to determine the impact of benzodiazepine restrictions on benzodiazepine-
related harms and the use of other psychotropic medications. The proposed work will use retrospective
longitudinal TennCare data linked to Medicare Part D, Vital Records, and State hospitalization data to examine
three specific aims: Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that benzodiazepine restrictions in 2006 led to a lower rate
of falls, fractures and opioid-related overdoses among TennCare patients with indications for benzodiazepines
use compared to patients without indications for benzodiazepines. Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that the
implementation and subsequent removal of benzodiazepine restrictions in 2006 and 2014 led to compensatory
changes in the rates of filled prescriptions for other similarly indicated psychotropic medications among
TennCare patients with indications for benzodiazepine use. Aim 3: To test the hypothesis that the removal of
benzodiazepine restrictions in 2014 led to a higher rate of falls, fractures and opioid-related overdoses among
patients with indications for benzodiazepine use compared to patients without indications for benzodiazepine
use. To inform the proposed work and the development of an independent research program focused on drug
safety research, the candidate has identified mentors with relevant expertise to oversee additional training
opportunities in (1) the application of advanced difference-in-difference designs for the evaluation of state
policy changes, (2) the clinical needs and barriers to care among patients that use benzodiazepines and other
psychotropic drugs, and (3) the large-scale linkage of claims data with other clinical and administrative data
sources. Findings from this study will inform future strategies to reduce benzodiazepine- and opioid-
related harms, including benzodiazepine and opioid-related overdoses and death."

This is a renewal application to extend post-intervention observational follow-up for 5 yrs in the VITamin D and
OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL), a randomized, placebo-controlled factorial trial of daily vitamin D3 (2000 IU) and
marine omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 FAs; 1-g Omacor® fish-oil capsule, with eicosapentaenoic acid [460 mg] +
docosahexaenoic acid [380 mg]) in the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD) among
25,871 US men aged ≥50 and women aged ≥55 yrs, including 5,106 African Americans. Median treatment was
5.3 yrs. Funding for the ongoing 2-yr post-intervention follow-up (plus data closeout/analysis) ends on May 31,
2020. A 5-yr extension will yield a median post-intervention follow-up of 7 yrs and median cumulative
(intervention + post-intervention) follow-up of 12 yrs. During the trial, although vitamin D did not significantly
reduce total invasive cancer incidence in the overall cohort, there was a promising signal for a reduction in total
cancer mortality, and subgroup analyses indicated cancer protection in African Americans and those with
normal body mass index. Although n-3 FAs did not reduce major CVD events in the total cohort, there were
significant reductions in myocardial infarction (MI) and other coronary endpoints; subgroup analyses showed
reductions in major CVD events in those with low baseline fish intake and in MI in African Americans. Longer
follow-up to account for latency effects and additional research to learn which individuals may be most likely to
derive a net supplementation benefit is warranted. Annual surveys will update risk factors and endpoint
occurrence. Reported endpoints will be confirmed by medical record review and augmented with Medicare
linkage surveillance for maximal and unbiased endpoint capture. Deaths will be ascertained via the National
Death Index-Plus. Archived baseline blood/DNA samples will allow examination of whether effects of the trial
agents on cancer and CVD vary by (a) genetic factors (targeted variants in genes related to vitamin D
metabolism, absorption, or receptor function or n-3 FA synthesis and activation; gene-based ancestry; genetic
risk scores); (b) vitamin K and magnesium status; and (c) novel vitamin D and n-3 FA biomarkers. Moreover,
continued infrastructure funding will enhance the value of ongoing ancillary studies evaluating the trial agents’
role in prevention of other diseases (23 funded studies to date, including diabetes, cognitive decline, bone
disorders, and autoimmune conditions) and allow for future ones, including an examination of intervention
effects on tumor molecular markers, DNA methylation, and gene expression. Building upon VITAL’s
strengths—including a large, well-characterized, racially diverse cohort with high compliance throughout the
trial; archived blood samples; dietary and lifestyle assessments; and rigorously adjudicated endpoints—our
proposal offers an exceptionally innovative and cost-efficient (<$100/participant/yr in direct costs) opportunity
to advance knowledge about the role of vitamin D and n-3 FAs in human health and disease. This is a high-
impact study due to the potential for major clinical and public health implications of the findings."

Modern X-ray–based radiation therapy, delivered at conventional dose rates (~0.1 Gy/s, 2-Gy fractions, once
daily) (C-XRT) has led to improved outcomes for patients with head & neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC) and prostate cancer (PC). However, acute and long-term treatment-related side effects in both
cancers have prompted the search for more biologically sound novel therapeutic strategies. Conventional dose
rate proton radiotherapy (C-PT) may provide better tumor control with less treatment-related toxicity than C-
XRT in both HNSCC and PC because of its biological enhancement effects and unique physical properties, but
use of PT has been limited by its high cost. Here we aim to test the effects of a novel form of RT delivery, in
which electrons, X-rays, or protons are delivered at ultra-high dose rates (≥40 Gy/s). This so-called “FLASH”
RT can deliver curative doses to tumors within milliseconds, while simultaneously minimizing damage to
surrounding tissues. The apparent protective effect of FLASH on normal tissues may further allow the use of
very large fractions, which would both shorten overall treatment time and reduce costs, especially for PT.
However, among the many unknowns at this time include (i) how FLASH-PT affects HNSCC and PC tumors
and surrounding normal tissues, and (ii) whether FLASH-PT can reduce treatment toxicity while preserving
treatment outcomes. We propose to address these important unknowns by testing the effects of FLASH-PT
and C-PT in a unique model system, established by us, on tumor response and normal tissue damage in vivo.
Our long-term objective is to establish a foundation for the clinical use of FLASH radiation to improve
outcomes for patients with HNSCC or PC. In our preliminary work, we have generated a FLASH-PT
experimental platform and homogenous dose distributions for FLASH-PT and C-PT for both in vitro and in vivo
experiments. Our novel in vitro findings are that: (i) FLASH-PT kills more HN5 HNSCC cells than C-PT; and (ii)
FLASH-PT preserves or enhances viability of Hs680.Tg normal tongue cells versus C-PT. Our immediate
goals for this R21 are reflected in our specific aims: (1) Determine the functional and mechanistic effects of
FLASH-PT vs C-PT in vivo in high-α/β tumor models (HNSCC); and (2) Determine the functional and
mechanistic effects of FLASH-PT vs C-PT in vivo in low-α/β tumor models (PC). We expect that this high-
risk/high-reward project will provide preclinical evidence regarding the in vivo effects of FLASH-PT vs C-PT
(delivered in a variety of fraction numbers and sizes) on HNSCC and PC tumors and surrounding normal
tissues. This knowledge will serve as the basis for choosing FLASH-PT or C-PT for individual patients, with the
ultimate goals of improving treatment efficacy, minimizing treatment-related toxicity, and reducing treatment
costs."

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most devastating form of brain cancer. In the next year, approximately 22,000 
Americans will develop GBM and nearly the same number will die from it. While GBM occurs in both males and 
females, we can reliably predict that of the 22,000 new cases, 8,500 will be in females while the remaining 13,500 
cases will be in males. Moreover, while the median survival for female GBM patients next year is expected to be 
approximately 22 months, for males it will be closer to 16 months. The molecular bases for these consistent and 
significant sex differences in incidence and survival are unexplained. In the absence of an explanation, it is 
impossible to fully know what the implications are for modeling GBM in the laboratory and for treating GBM in 
the clinic. Defining the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that underlie sex differences in GBM 
incidence and survival is the focus of this project. We recently published an analysis of GBM patient imaging, 
transcriptomes, and survival in which we determined that female GBM patients exhibit greater response to the 
current standard treatments and that their survival is highly correlated with expression of components of the 
integrin signaling pathway. In contrast, male GBM patients exhibit less robust response to current treatment and 
their survival appears to be more potently determined by expression levels of the cell cycle regulatory machinery. 
These data not only provide new insights into sex differences in GBM biology, they suggest that sex-specific 
targeting of pathways that support survival in females and males could lead to improved outcomes for all patients. 
Sex differences in health and disease accrue throughout life as a consequence of sexual differentiation. Sexual 
differentiation, which begins at the time of fertilization, involves genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, as well as 
the acute actions of circulating sex hormones. We have developed murine models for studying sex differences 
in GBM. Here, we will use our innovative Cas-9 adaptation of the established four-core genotypes model for 
measuring the distinct contributions of sex chromosome complement and gonadal secretions to sex differences 
in GBM biology. Coupled with in utero electroporation of gRNAs and other genetic constructs, we will be uniquely 
positioned to assess how sex-specific changes in chromatin structure and expression of specific genes mediate 
the sex differences in GBM. We have two aims to address the hypothesis that sex differences in GBM incidence 
and outcome are determined at early stages of in utero sexual differentiation (Aim 1) and involve sex-specific 
patterning in gene expression and activity in integrin and cell cycle regulatory pathways (Aim 2). At all stages of 
this work we will incorporate specific questions about sexual differentiation and iron metabolism (Project 2) and 
microglia function (Project 3). Together these studies will provide critical information in our effort to understand 
the molecular basis for sex differences in GBM and a path for the implementation of sex-specific treatment for 
GBM and other cancers that exhibit sex differences in incidence and outcome."
10814375,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Animals live in dynamic, ever-changing environments. As such, survival requires them to explore their
environment and process the barrage of sensory signals to form predictions about what to expect and how to
respond to incoming sensory information. The requisite neural processing for naturalistic behaviors is highly
complex, requiring the coordination of multiple brain functions including multisensory processing, sensorimotor
integration, cognitive functions, and motor planning and execution. Thus, to understand the neural basis for
naturalistic behaviors, it is essential to simultaneously study the behavioral and neural activity of animal models
under relatively unrestrained conditions. A paragon example of such work is the neuronal basis of navigation in
rodents and bats. However, the cognitive capacities, dexterous hands, and front-facing visual systems of human
and non-human primates (NHPs) make them uniquely capable of predicting and influencing their environments.
For this reason, NHPs are an ideal animal model for investigating human-relevant brain functions during complex,
naturalistic behaviors. Thus, the goal of the current proposal is to develop and vet a novel research platform for
conducting naturalistic studies with NHPs using navigation as the model system. To date, significant technical
barriers have precluded the development of a robust freely moving monkey (FMM) framework. Here, we propose
to implement fully wireless behavioral and multichannel neuronal data acquisition with female and male rhesus
monkeys (Maccaca mulatta) during the free exploration of an open-field FMM arena. We will use 3D motion
capture technology to record head, body, and upper limb movements. A novel facemask that is custom-designed
and individualized for each animal will be used to perform binocular eye tracking. In addition, a novel microdrive
system that is magnetic resonance imaging compatible will be used to safely and simultaneously introduce
electrodes into multiple deep brain regions of the limbic system, as well as precisely verify the recording locations
without histology. The microdrive system and a mobile neurologger will be contained within the cranial implant,
enabling tether-less recordings while the animal is within the FMM arena as well as the home enclosure. To vet
the FMM framework, we propose to use a free foraging paradigm. We will specifically test if well-established
navigational properties found in rodents and bats are conserved in NHPs. Importantly, we will explore whether
the neural circuitry is also elaborated in the primate brain to leverage the binocular, front-facing visual system.
In particular, we will study the gaze-related properties of neurons during naturalistic behavior. We highly
anticipate that behavioral and neuronal data acquired through this novel research platform will be unprecedented,
enabling a more complete understanding of naturalistic primate brain functions including spatial navigation,
visual and vestibular sensory processing, and motor control. Critically, this proposal sets the stage for the FMM
framework to become an unparalleled research platform for investigating primate brain function in normal and
diseased states with high human translational value."

across the relevant communities within Yale (Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Biomedical Engineering,
Psychology) to prepare them to successfully pursue careers in research focused on improving human health,
reducing health disparities, and improving health systems. In recognition of the critical need to foster the
development of young investigators at multiple points during training, we established four training opportunities
within our program that span pre- and post-doctoral training. Each of these programs builds on a remarkable
track record of accomplishment, but each is also newly adapted to respond to the current educational context
and the emerging research opportunities. In so doing, our training programs embrace education in team
learning, data science and organizational practice so as to prepare the next generation of translational
researchers to emerge as leaders. These 4 programs, presented as specific aims include:
1) The National Clinician Scholars Program (NCSP) that provides two years of outstanding training for
post-doctoral fellows in either nursing or medicine who are focused on careers in T3-T4 translational
research to improve health and healthcare policy for communities and populations;
2) The Investigative Medicine PhD Program (IMP) that provides 3-5 years of rigorous PhD training for
physicians who have completed their clinical training and haven chosen to pursue careers in
translational (T1-T4) research; and
3) The Multidisciplinary Pre-Doctoral Training Program in Translational Research (MPreDTP) that
provides pre-doctoral trainees in the Schools of Medicine, Nursing, Public Health and Biomedical
engineering with one or two full year devoted to training across the full span (T1-T4) of clinical and
translational research.
4) The Multidisciplinary Post-Doctoral Training Program in Translational Research (MPostDTP) that
provides post-doctoral PhD trainees in the Schools of Medicine, Nursing, Public Health and Biomedical
engineering with one or two full years devoted to training across the full span (T1-T4) of clinical and
translational research.
The objectives of this TL1 application are to: 1) identify and support a representative and diverse group of
outstanding trainees for entry into the appropriate one of these four programs; 2) provide them with a strong
multidisciplinary education anchored in courses offered through degree-granting programs; 3) provide a
mentored translational research experience in a biological, social behavioral, community-engaged and/or
public health domain; 3) provide training and hands-on experience in multidisciplinary team science; 4) provide
ongoing mentoring in how to conduct meaningful translational research and in support of their career
development; 5) provide instruction to increase their abilities to translate research into real-world contexts to
impact policies and practices for interventions and preventive practices that affect health; and 6) to objectively
evaluate the umbrella TL1, its four training programs, and achievement of short- and long-term goals by the
individual trainees in order to modify the TL1 activities accordingly. Team-based approaches to research are
specifically emphasized by providing year-long didactic training in team science and team building, coupled
with inter-program experiential team research performed jointly by the TL1 and KL2 trainees."

Education for science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields is critical to prepare
students for careers within the biomedical sciences. Research indicates that traditional science
teaching focused on rote memorization decontextualizes learning and diminishes students’
willingness to engage in science education. Well-designed educational media can support
strong science-focused teacher pedagogy and foster student interest in science topics and
STEM careers. Educational media assets such as digital videos and graphic novels assets
provide grounding contexts that support varied learning assessments, STEM interest, and
intention to pursue related careers. Such educational media resources support long term
students team-based collaboration, growth in assessed learning outcomes, and provide
exposure to possible STEM career choices. The proposed educational media can be quickly
developed and widely distributed through common, existing digital platforms, making it a
promising approach for broad dissemination. Comprehensive evaluation is needed to determine
whether the proposed graphic novel or documentary video media are more effective than
traditional lecture and readings-based science instruction. The overall hypothesis of this SEPA
is that well-designed educational media treatments can be more effective than traditional STEM
subject instruction to grow interest in related fields, increased knowledge retention, and
improved student STEM career intention. Three aims will be used to test the hypothesis: Aim 1:
Create science-based graphic novel and documentary videos with supporting lesson plans, as
well as isometric traditionally delivered, face-to-face lessons that will be used to
comprehensively and longitudinally test the project hypotheses with 7th and 9th grade students.
Aim 2: Conduct evaluations of the graphic novel and documentary video educational media
treatments with diverse populations of students to determine their effectiveness in delivering
STEM educational materials, explore whether the digital curricula and media improve student
interest in STEM topics, and whether exposure to the digital materials improves student
intentions to pursue STEM careers. Aim 3: Provide teacher professional development to train
teachers to effectively deliver the digitally delivered educational media."

 Research and treatment approaches in pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) have focused primarily on the
deposition and clearance of beta-amyloid which leads to the formation of cortical plaques and neurofibrillary
tangles, a hallmark of AD pathology. However, the role that vascular factors may have in the development of
these pathologies is not clear. Epidemiological studies have suggested that risk factors such as high cholesterol,
hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and inflammation are associated with an increased risk of developing AD. Several
studies have demonstrated that certain cardiovascular genetic markers are associated with clinical AD and its
pathological hallmarks. Specific polymorphisms of the CRP gene (rs3091244, and rs3093075) are associated
with greater plaque load while the rs1205 and rs2794521 polymorphisms appears to protect against amyloid
deposition. The methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene has been implicated as a susceptibility
marker for AD and is also recognized as an important factor in cardiovascular disease due to its role in regulating
homocysteine. The MTHFR C677T (rs1801133) polymorphism is a marker of interest in both the AD and
cardiovascular contexts and it is noted that this polymorphism interacts with APOE carrier status on
cardiovascular outcomes. There is also evidence that the rs1801131 polymorphism influences the risk of AD and
has shown to moderate the effect of APOE on AD risk. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has also been
implicated in AD as the C2578A allele (rs699947) has been associated with an increased risk for AD in which a
significant VEGF by APOE interaction may play a role. The G1154A (rs1570360) polymorphism of VEGF has
shown to have a protective effect for AD. The kinesin family member 6 (KIF6) gene's 719Arg polymorphism
(rs20455) has been strongly implicated in the risk for cardiovascular events, but its possible role in AD has not
been fully investigated. The rs3025039 polymorphism has also shown consistent associations with
cardiovascular disease however its link with AD risk or pathology is unknown. The aim of this study will be to
examine the effects of these cardiovascular gene markers on imaging-based measures of amyloid in cognitively
unimpaired older adults. This study will also explore whether the interactions between APOE e4 carrier status
and these alleles are associated with in vivo plaque and tangle load."

In the proposed work, I will be investigating how neural stem cells establish ‘proliferative asymmetries’, which
are responsible for precisely controlling the development and repair of the central nervous system. During
development and tissue repair, stem cells are triggered to proliferate. While proliferation is necessary, it must be
precise to prevent overgrowth that can lead to tumorigenesis. As neural stem cells proliferate, they commonly
divide asymmetrically. The ability to undergo asymmetric cell division is a highly conserved feature of neural
stem cells across all animals. Asymmetric cell division produces one daughter cell that retains the neural stem
cell identity, and one daughter cell which takes on a neuron-producing progenitor cell identity. A key difference
between these two daughter cells is that the stem cell will rapidly reenter the cell cycle and divide again, while
the progenitor cell will divide much more slowly or stop dividing all together. This proliferative asymmetry ensures
that the proper number of neurons are produced, and its disruption leads to defects in neurogenesis. The
molecular basis for this proliferative asymmetry mostly unknown. I will focus my independent research program
around the mechanisms which establish this proliferative asymmetry. I hypothesize that this proliferative
asymmetry is established by the differential inheritance of proliferation promoting factors during asymmetric cell
division. I plan to learn how neural stem cells generate proliferative asymmetries in both invertebrates and
vertebrates, through the use of Drosophila and zebrafish animal models. Studying both animal models will allow
me to identify conserved and divergent modes of generating proliferative asymmetries in neural stem cells, while
also providing me with new training opportunities. Both animal models are highly amenable to live cell imaging
of neural stem cells in developing brains. In Aim 1, I will screening for proliferation regulators which are polarized
in the mother neural stem cell. In Aim 2, I will determine how polarized proliferative regulators contribute to
proliferative asymmetries between sibling cells. In Aim 3, I will determine how PAR polarity proteins regulate the
PI3K proliferation pathway. Through my initial screening, I have already discovered one promising candidate
that appears to mediate the proliferative asymmetry in the neural stem cell lineage, the lipid PIP3. PIP3 is
transiently produced by the mother neural stem cell just before division, becomes polarized to one side of the
cell, and gets inherited by the daughter cell which retains the neural stem cell identity. Discovering how PIP3
and other factors establish proliferative asymmetries during asymmetric cell division will advance our
understanding of how neural stem cells mediate development and tissue repair. Through training activities aimed
at improving my skills in grant writing, scientific teaching, and mentoring, I will be better prepared to run my own
laboratory. The scientific discoveries and training this proposal will facilitate, will be foundational to building my
independent research program."

This K23 application from Dr. Justina Groeger proposes a mentored research and career development plan
that will advance her goal of becoming a leading physician-investigator who tests health systems strategies to
minimize opioid-related harms, particularly among older adults (age ≥65). Post-operative care is a time when
excessive opioid prescribing occurs which can result in unnecessary harms, particularly to older and frail
adults. An EHR-embedded, provider-facing, patient-specific, discharge opioid taper support (DOTS)
intervention may reduce excessive post-operative opioid prescribing, but has not been rigorously tested, and
even if made available in the EHR, provider- and patient- factors are likely to influence whether providers use
the intervention for patients. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to rigorously test DOTS, an
intervention with three components: 1) a recommendation for a patient-specific opioid taper schedule based on
patient opioid use prior to discharge, 2) an automated default discharge opioid prescription based on the
recommended taper schedule, and 3) post-discharge enhanced telephonic support for patients. We will
randomize 42 providers to DOTS or telephonic support alone (TS) for 15-months, collect electronic health
record data for their 1890 patients having orthopedic surgery, collect patient-reported outcomes from a subset
of 100 (50 from providers in each group), and conduct a qualitative study of 21 DOTS providers. The specific
aims are to: 1) determine the effectiveness of DOTS for reducing excessive opioid prescribing after orthopedic
surgery, 2) test the impact of DOTS on patient-reported post-operative outcomes including pain intensity,
physical function, and emergency post-operative care; and 3) identify determinants of provider use of DOTS.
We hypothesize that compared to patients of TS providers, patients of DOTS providers will have favorable
outcomes including reduction in excessive opioid prescribing and improved pain and function after surgery. By
completing the proposed research and career development plan, Dr. Groeger will gain skills in 1) design and
conduct of randomized controlled trials, 2) development and implementation of EHR-embedded interventions,
3) qualitative research methods, and 4) advanced longitudinal data analysis. The proposed research will lead
to an R01 application to rigorously test DOTS at other hospitals and future trials testing DOTS at hospital
discharge for other (non-orthopedic) causes of acute pain. With the completion of these activities and with the
guidance of a team of multi-disciplinary mentors, Dr. Groeger will obtain the skills necessary to achieve her
career goal of become a leading physician-investigator who tests health systems strategies to minimize opioid-
related harms, particularly among older adults."
10816539,"The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly exacerbated rising patterns of excessive alcohol consumption, particularly
in women. Binge alcohol drinking is the most common pattern of excessive alcohol drinking and is associated
with increased risk of developing mood disorders and Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). Social support strongly
buffers against alcohol craving and relapse, yet many individuals display reduced valuation of social rewards
and/or deficits in the processing of social stimuli following alcohol exposure and subsequent abstinence. This
may compound interpersonal problems in people with AUD and limit their capacity to seek out or receive social
support. Therefore, understanding the neurobiological mechanisms mediating alcohol’s effects on social
behavior is required to inform future treatments aimed at enhancing social functioning and reducing relapse in
patients with AUD. Drinking in the Dark (DiD) is a robust paradigm for investigating the circuit and molecular
mechanisms of binge-like alcohol consumption on physiology and behavior in rodents. In addition, the 3-chamber
sociability model permits the interrogation of both social reward and social recognition behaviors following
alcohol consumption. Serotonin (5-Hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) receptor signaling in the lateral habenula (LHb)
has been implicated in the development of negative emotional states associated with abstinence from alcohol,
but the LHb remains highly understudied in the context of AUD. I recently found that DiD reduced social
recognition selectively in female mice during abstinence, and that genetic deletion of the LHb Gq-protein coupled
serotonin receptor 5HT2c partially prevented this effect. My preliminary data suggests that binge alcohol
consumption enhances the intrinsic excitability of LHb 5HT2c-containing neurons (LHb5HT2c) in the medial sub-
region, that 5-HT is released onto LHb5HT2c during social interaction, and that acute engagement of Gi signaling
in LHb5HT2c can normalize social deficits induced by alcohol. Moreover, DiD appears to modulate the expression
of multiple 5-HT receptor subtypes co-expressed in LHb5HT2c. Together, these data suggest that excessive
activation of LHb5HT2c via dysregulation of 5-HT receptor signaling may underlie social deficits induced by alcohol.
Using these preliminary findings as a foundation for the current proposal, I will 1) characterize how DiD alters
the translational and physiological landscape of LHb5HT2c projecting to the DRN (5HT2cLHb-DRN) and 2) investigate
the functional impact of genetic manipulation of 5-HT receptor sub-types in 5HT2cLHb-DRN on neuronal physiology
and DiD-induced dysregulation of social behavior. Together, these experiments will determine the effects of
binge alcohol drinking on molecular and physiological processes in 5HT2cLHb-DRN and identify novel mechanisms
by which these neurons promote social dysfunction during abstinence. Furthermore, this award will provide me
with valuable technical and professional training that will facilitate my transition to independence."

 The use of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) for patients with advanced heart failure has continued to
increase over the years. The significant improvement in survival with the current generation of LVADs is in large
part due to the advances in device durability, and mechanics. However, several important factors continue to
limit the benefit of LVAD support and ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTA) following LVAD implantation has been
suggested to be associated with subsequent repeat hospitalization and increased mortality. Our retrospective
data from the University of Rochester have shown that patients who developed VTA following LVAD implant
experienced a 7-fold increase in subsequent mortality risk. Importantly, we have also shown that the most
powerful predictor of VTA post LVAD implant is a history of VTA at any time prior to the LVAD. Several ablation
trials have demonstrated reduction of recurrent VTA and, in selected at-risk patient groups with ischemic heart
disease, mortality. These findings suggest an effective early intervention with VTA ablation peri-LVAD
implantation in high-risk patients, specifically those with a history of VTA, may reduce VTA recurrence and
improve clinical outcomes. Utilization of this strategy has varied amongst centers as there are no prospective
data on the efficacy and safety of this management. Accordingly, we propose a prospective, randomized,
multicenter clinical trial that will evaluate prophylactic intra-operative VTA ablation in high-risk LVAD recipients
on clinical outcomes. The study cohort will consist of 100 LVAD candidate patients with a prior history of VTA
and ischemic cardiomyopathy randomized to either prophylactic intra-operative VTA ablation vs. conventional
medical management in a 1:1 fashion. Eight high-volume LVAD implant centers with experience in VTA ablation
will participate.
 The primary specific aim is to evaluate the effect of prophylactic intra-operative VTA ablation at the time of
LVAD implantation on post-implant total recurrent VTA events after accounting for the competing risk of death.
Secondary specific aims are: 1) To evaluate the effects of a management strategy that incorporates intra-
operative VT ablation at the time of LVAD implantation on adverse clinical outcomes following LVAD
implantation; 2) To collect prospective data on peri-procedural outcomes associated with the proposed novel
approach of prophylactic intra-operative VT ablation. We will also explore the mechanisms associated with: a)
recurrent VTA post LVAD implant with electrophysiology studies and b) the ramifications of recurrent VTA on
right ventricular hemodynamics post LVAD implant with echocardiographic ramp studies and right heart
catheterization."

The goal of this proposal is to define the mechanisms of Cu homeostasis in the cell envelope of the
pathogen Salmonella enterica. This organism is an important and frequent cause of gastroenteritis, as
well as, systemic infections. Cu is required as a redox co-factor in the catalytic centers of enzymes.
However, free Cu is highly reactive and deleterious to cells. Cu, along with the oxidative burst, is central
in host-pathogen interactions as part of the innate immune response. As such, redox/Cu homeostasis is
essential for bacterial virulence. While there has been significant progress in identifying cytoplasmic Cu
homeostatic mechanisms, there is a lack of understanding of how the cell envelope handles and
distributes Cu, whilst maintaining the associated redox balance. Our goal is to define and model the Cu
distribution in the Salmonella cell envelope and identify its molecular links with the redox stress response.
The aims of this proposal are: 1) Quantify Cu fluxes and equilibria among periplasmic, cytoplasmic and
external compartments while defining the size and identity of the periplasmic Cu sink pool. 2) Define the
role of CueP as the periplasmic Cu chaperone exchanging the metal with various targets. We will monitor
CueP in vivo abundance, as well as its apo/holo equilibria, in response to changes in periplasmic Cu
levels. We will determine how CueP obtains Cu from membrane transporters in the inner and outer
membranes and delivers it to alternative carriers to achieve steady state levels of periplasmic Cu. CueP
participation in the metallation of several periplasmic cuproenzymes will be assessed. 3) Determine the
role of the ScsABCD system at the interface of Cu- and redox-homeostasis. The redox activity of these
enzymes will be determined and in vivo substrates identified. The relation between ScsABCD activity and
Cu binding to substrates or among ScsABCD enzymes will be established. To achieve these aims, the
joint efforts of two laboratories with complementing expertise will use a combination of approaches
(modeling of metal fluxes, proteomics, metallomics, in vitro host/pathogen interaction). Our approach to
systematically elucidate the mechanisms of Cu/redox homeostasis in the envelope of an important
human pathogen is novel, timely and innovative."

Current data indicate that that purinergic signaling can potentially affect every cell in the human body. Indeed,
one theory is that extracellular ATP (eATP) is the oldest, extracellular signal involved in cell-cell
communication. The mechanisms of purinergic signaling are well-established in animals and, indeed, support a
multibillion dollar pharmaceutical industry. In contrast, relatively little is known about purinergic signaling in
plants. Plants do not possess canonical P2X an P2Y purinoreceptors. Indeed, our lab previously identified a
new class of purinoreceptors in plants, exemplified by plasma membrane lectin-receptor-like-kinases, P2K1
and P2K2. Our research indicates that purinergic signaling in plants is as ubiquitous and impactful as that
found in mammals and, indeed, many of the downstream effects are similar. The differences seen, comparing
plants and animals, are due largely to the unique biochemistry of the P2K receptors. These are unique
receptors in that they possess both kinase and nucleotide cyclase activity. Hence, the primary aim of this
proposal is to explore further the function of these receptors and, specifically, the relative contribution of these
two activities to cellular response to eATP. Specific aim 1 will address the hypothesis that ATP released from
plant cells activates both P2K1 nucleotide cyclase and kinase activity, which subsequently mediate distinct
downstream, cellular responses. Study 1 will utilize mutant studies of P2K1 to define the relative contribution
of these two activities to downstream signaling responses. Study 2 will explore the relative importance of P2K1
cyclase and kinase activity relative to the activation of cyclic nucleotide gated calcium channels (CNGC).
Study 3 will examine whether activation of the cytoplasmic kinase, BIK1, via P2K1 phosphorylation leads to
CNGC Ca2+ channel activation. Specific aim 2 will address the hypothesis that, as is the case in animals,
plants likely have multiple purinoreceptors that may act in specific tissues, during specific stages of
development or in response to specific stresses. Preliminary data argue that additional purinoreceptors exist in
plants. Hence, Study 4 will seek to identify additional plant purinoreceptors using a variety of approaches.
Most notable is our finding that mutations that suppress the phenotypes of p2k1 mutants do so in the apparent
absence of any known purinoreceptor, clearly indicating that other mechanisms must exist. Preliminary data
suggest that purinoreceptors mediate the negative effects of stress on plant growth. Study 5 will explore how
wounding stress is coupled to a reduction in growth by exploring the role of an atypical basic-helix-loop-helix
protein, previously implicated in growth regulation, that is a direct target of P2K1 phosphorylation. The net
result of our work is to provide the comparative data to add to our overall understanding of purinergic signaling
in higher eukaryotes, illustrating differences and similarities, and ultimately laying the basis for opportunities to
manipulate these pathways for therapeutic applications."

This proposal describes the framework of an NIAID New Innovators DP2 award for Kiera Clayton, PhD. Dr.
Clayton is currently a postdoctoral fellow under the supervision of Dr. Bruce Walker at the Ragon Institute of
MGH, MIT and Harvard, whose current research focuses on T cell and NK cell-mediated killing of HIV-infected
macrophages, and the implications for HIV reservoir persistence and macrophage-mediated inflammation. In
addition to Dr. Clayton’s published work suggesting that macrophages are resistant to T cell-mediated killing,
preliminary results included in this proposal suggest that HIV exploits macrophages to evade NK cell-mediated
killing, by mechanisms distinct from those used to evade T cell responses. As macrophages also act as the
primary cellular reservoir for other chronic pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the question
remains whether macrophages provide a common “Hide-Out” for immunoevasion. Thus, the overall goal of this
proposal is to characterize the mechanisms employed by macrophages infected by different chronic pathogens
to evade immune-mediated clearance and explore the possibility of targeting a common immunoevasion
pathway to enhance T cell and NK cell killing of infected macrophages. This proposal focuses on three Research
Areas. The first Research Area will build on preliminary data to define the mechanisms by which HIV-infected
macrophages prevent NK cell-mediated killing. To quantify the resistance of macrophages infected with Mtb to
T cell and NK cell-mediated elimination and characterize the accompanying immunoevasion mechanisms, the
second Research Area will characterize the interactions between Mtb-infected macrophage and antigen-specific
T cells and NK cells. Finally, as Dr. Clayton’s published work suggests that inefficient killing of macrophages is
a result of resistance to apoptosis-inducing T cell-derived granzymes, the third Research Area will probe for the
identities of granzyme inhibitors expressed by macrophages, and subsequently knockout candidate genes to
enhance T and NK cell-mediated killing of infected macrophages. Together, these studies will provide insight
into whether targeting natural granzyme inhibitors can provide a common method to enhance immune-mediated
clearance of macrophages infected by different pathogens. The goals of this proposal are highly relevant to the
mission of NIAID, and will enhance our understanding of distinct pathogen-specific immunoevasion mechanisms
and those inherently characteristic of macrophages that allow for pathogen persistence despite strong immune
responses. Ultimately, this work will aid the design and development of therapeutics to target HIV and Mtb
infection in macrophages, and will potentiate future studies to assess how macrophage-mediated
immunoevasion contributes to persistence of other pathogens, including human cytomegalovirus."

A low nicotine product standard for cigarettes and other combusted tobacco products has been proposed as a
cornerstone of the FDA’s Comprehensive Plan for Tobacco and Nicotine Regulation in the United States (US).
This proposed standard is based largely on randomized clinical trials demonstrating that when people switch to
very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes, cigarettes per day, dependence and biomarkers of smoke
exposure decrease and quit attempts and cessation increase. Yet, these trials have impo rtant limitations.
Notably, they limit the duration of exposure to VLNC cigarettes; cannot recreate the complex context of real -
world product standards; are characterized by the use of non-study, normal nicotine cigarettes; and generally
focus on samples of convenience. In December 2021, the New Zealand (NZ) Government launched the
Smokefree Aotearoa 2025 Action Plan, outlining a strategy to reduce smoking prevalence to less than 5%. The
plan is world-leading with transformative goals including: 1) eliminate health inequities in smoking rates and
smoking-related illness; 2) ensure youth never start smoking tobacco; and 3) increase quitting in people who
smoke. A major component of the initiative is to mandate a low nicotine product standard for all smoked
tobacco. Our primary research objective is to assess the real-world impact of a mandated reduction of nicotine
in all smoked tobacco products in NZ to inform the implementation of US nicotine reduction policy. We propose
to conduct a longitudinal, mixed methods cohort study of adults who smoke daily or nearly daily (N=1500),
using online surveys, biomarkers of exposure, physiological assessments, qualitative interviews, and medical
records to assess changes in smoking behavior, health and well-being. We will follow the cohort for 3.5 years
(1.5 years before and 1 year after implementation of a low nicotine product standard). We will also explore
potential heterogeneity by explicitly sampling individuals from three priority populations important in NZ and the
US (individuals with self-reported anxiety and depression; young adults living in socioeconomically deprived
areas; and individuals who report heavy alcohol and/or cannabis use) and ensuring representation of NZ ethnic
groups (Māori, Pacifika) with disproportionately high smoking prevalence. We will also enroll people who
smoke but do not belong to priority populations. The primary outcome for Aim 1 is abstinence from smoked
tobacco (self-reported and biochemically-verified) at 52 weeks after policy implementation. The primary
outcome for Aim 2 is Health-Related Quality of Life ratings at 52 weeks after policy implementation. Aim 3 will
explore potential heterogeneity in response to a low nicotine products standard. Our proposal will directly
inform the US nicotine reduction policy agenda recently announced by the Biden Administration and aligns with
several priorities outlined in RFA-OD-21-002. As a team, we have complementary areas of expertise (e.g.,
behavioral pharmacology, public health and medicine, biostatistics, epidemiology, qualitative and mixed
methods, and health equity) to ensure the successful completion of the current proposal."
10906822,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Prenatal care is a critical lever for improving maternity outcomes for the 4 million women who
give birth annually. Yet, the traditional model of care—a uniform 14 in-person visits—overtreats and unduly
burdens many patients. The COVID-19 pandemic rapidly transformed prenatal care delivery, prompting
adoption of hybrid prenatal care models (reduced visit schedules with telemedicine). These changes are the
basis for new national prenatal care consensus recommendations: the Plan for Appropriate Tailored
Healthcare in pregnancy (PATH). Reduced visit schedules and telemedicine are supported by evidence and
expert opinion, but it is unclear how hybrid prenatal care models will affect care utilization, health outcomes,
and patient and provider experience, particularly for marginalized patient groups with the worst baseline
outcomes. While PATH is promising for removing access barriers, changes could have unintended
consequences (e.g. more unscheduled or delayed care). Thus, there is a critical need to evaluate the effects of
hybrid prenatal care models to inform adaptations for widespread implementation for medically average-risk
and marginalized patient populations.
OVERALL STRATEGY: This research aims to understand how hybrid prenatal care models affect service
utilization and health outcomes for average-risk patients, especially those from marginalized groups (low-
income, Black, and rural patients). To achieve these goals, we will conduct econometric analyses to compare
prenatal care utilization and outcomes from two institutions that have initiated and maintained hybrid prenatal
care models to the present (Michigan Medicine, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center) with a control site
(Indiana University) that adopted the hybrid prenatal care model only from March-May 2020 before returning to
traditional care. We will used mixed methods to integrate EHR data with in-depth qualitative interviews to
explain differences in utilization and critical adaptations needed to improve prenatal care delivery for average-
risk and key marginalized groups.
RESEARCH AIMS: Our study’s aims are: 1) Evaluate the effects of hybrid prenatal care models on care
utilization and health outcomes for average-risk patients. 2) Explore how patient and provider factors affect
utilization of hybrid prenatal care models to inform critical adaptations for optimizing prenatal care.
IMPACT: This timely investigation is highly likely to exert a sustained, powerful impact on prenatal care
delivery, maternal and neonatal outcomes, and equity, with potential for particular benefit among marginalized
pregnant patients."

 Becoming a mother is often associated with a unique sense of joy, serenity, and personal fulfillment. A
tremendous number of pregnant and postpartum women cannot reach these positive states, though, because
they struggle with high levels of life stress. High pregnancy stress degrades women’s later ability to sensitively
care for their infants, and in very severe cases contributes to infant neglect and abuse. In addition, elevated
stress during pregnancy is one of the most reliable and strongest predictors of maternal depression and
anxiety, which afflict 10-15% of the four million pregnant and recently parturient women in the U.S. each year.
 There is a dearth of knowledge about the specific neural mechanisms through which stress contributes to
maternal depression, anxiety, and poor infant caregiving. Without such knowledge, it is virtually impossible to
know how to best intervene or treat women who are at the highest risk. The long-term goal of this line of basic
research is to better understand how stress during pregnancy derails postpartum behavior by affecting
interactions between the stress-signaling neuropeptide, corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), and the
neurotransmitter, serotonin (5-HT). The objective of this R21 exploratory/developmental project is to use a
laboratory rat model of motherhood to begin testing the hypothesis that female reproduction generates
normative changes in CRF receptors in the midbrain dorsal raphe nucleus (i.e., the source of most forebrain 5-
HT), and that these changes are derailed by pregnancy stress. I further hypothesize that the normative
changes across reproduction in CRF receptors in the DR protect mothers against the negative consequences
of stress on their affective and caregiving behaviors. The proposed multi-method research employs a variety of
tools to answer our questions (qRT-PCR, receptor autoradiography, dual-label in situ hybridization, slice
electrophysiology, viral vector-mediated gene up/downregulation, detailed behavior analysis) and is innovative
because it the first to study how stressed and unstressed female reproduction affect CRF receptors site-
specifically in the serotonergic dorsal raphe, and more broadly to provide critical information about the
neurochemistry underlying stress’ impact on the female brain and behavior. This important basic research is
highly significant because our results have the potential to improve strategies for intervention and treatment of
the millions of women and their infants negatively affected by pregnancy stress each year."

Adult neural stem cells give rise to newly formed neurons in discrete areas of the mammalian central nervous
system. Whether adult neurogenesis occurs in the peripheral nervous system is unclear. We found a sparse cell
type in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) that expresses a growth factor shown to affect sensory neuronal survival
and axonal regeneration in culture systems and by exogenous application to injured nerves. However, the
endogenous source of this growth factor was unknown. Our discovery of this novel cell type suggests that the
DRG itself is the source for this growth factor. We will test this idea in Aim 1. We propose to examine the function
of this growth factor on sensory neuron viability in both naïve and injury contexts and axonal regeneration after
injury through both loss and gain-of-function mouse models. In addition, we have reason to believe that the cell
type expressing this growth factor may also have adult stem cell-like properties. In Aim 2, we will provide
evidence for whether adult neurogenesis occurs in the DRG. We will examine whether neurons repopulate the
DRG after injury, what types of DRG cells proliferate after injury long-term, and whether proliferation after injury
is dependent on this growth factor. In addition, we will develop genetic tools to follow the lineage of the sparse
cell type expressing this growth factor. Success in these Aims will provide evidence as to whether signaling
through this growth factor or secretion of the growth factor through the sparse DRG cell type should be explored
as a therapeutic strategy to support DRG cell viability, axonal regeneration, and perhaps neuronal regeneration
of somatosensory neurons after peripheral nerve injury or in degenerative diseases."

The World Health Organization estimated that 2016 and 2017 each saw an increase of 2–4 million cases of
malaria worldwide, rising to a total of 241 million cases and 627,000 deaths by 2020, mostly among small
children. These resurging numbers signal that the effective treatment of malaria is under threat from the
development of drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum and related malaria parasite species.
Consequently, combatting resistance is a critical priority and requires continued effort in discovery and
development of new antimalarial drug candidates with novel mechanisms of action.
Natural product chemistry has had a dramatic impact in treatment of infectious disease. Bastimolide A is a
recently discovered natural product that shows noteworthy activity (IC50 80–270nm) against resistant strains
of P. falciparum, and its polyketide structure is unique among current clinical and investigational antimalarial
drugs, suggesting a novel mechanism of action. If confirmed, this would strongly impact the field of
antimalarial drug discovery, offering a new avenue to address the critical priority of combatting drug
resistance.
Our specific aims in this proposal are (a) to synthesize bastimolide A and analogs, including chemoproteomics
probes, and (b) to evaluate their antiplasmodial potency, improve pharmacological properties, and identify
protein(s) and lifecycle stage(s) targeted. The synthetic aims will exploit efficient new synthetic methods
developed in the Friestad labs, including further development of a novel asymmetric catalysis approach to
1,2-difunctional compounds, and further expansion of a programmed synthesis approach to access 1,5-
polyols with complete control of challenging remote stereochemical relationships. The biological evaluation
of bastimolide A and analogs will employ resistant strains of P. falciparum, and for this aim, the extensive
experience with assessment and development of novel antimalarial drug leads in the Chakrabarti labs is
ideally suited. Measurement of EC50 versus chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum Dd2 will identify hits and verify
activity of chemoproteomics probes; the latter will allow isolation and identification of a biological target for
bastimolide A. Further screens of analogs will entail cross-resistance profiling versus geographical isolates
and evaluation of pharmacological properties such as aqueous solubility, LogD, permeability (PAMPA),
plasma protein binding and microsomal stability. A reiterative approach will be used, with feedback from initial
analogs guiding the selection of higher-priority analogs to prepare during the second year of the proposed
two-year funding period. The R03 funding requested will permit access to the preliminary results needed to
assess the viability of a more extensive project that would be competitive for funding via R21 or R01
mechanism."

Sepsis is a predominant life-threatening secondary complication following traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI).
Several predisposing factors such as polytrauma, prolonged/repeated hospital stay, pressure ulcer, and
indwelling catheters make SCI patients more susceptible to microbial infections that can lead to sepsis. Sepsis
is a leading cause of death after spinal trauma and is associated with poor functional outcomes among survivors.
Depending on the time of onset, there are two sepsis types. Sepsis diagnosed within 48hr of initial injury is
termed “primary” sepsis, and when its onset occurs after 48hr, it is known as “secondary” sepsis. Though sepsis
with SCI is a serious condition leading to diminished life expectancy and quality of life, this combined medical
issue has not been well studied. This is mainly due to lack of an appropriate animal model. Accordingly, the goal
of proposed study is to develop and validate a novel clinically relevant rodent model that closely mimics the long-
term dysfunction of survivors of sepsis after SCI. This model will be validated with six parameters: 1) survival
rate, 2) infection severity, 3) inflammatory cytokines, 4) locomotor score, 5) muscle force and 6) histopathology.
Our team has developed a clinically relevant rodent sepsis model consisting of polymicrobial abdominal sepsis
by cecal slurry (CS) injection followed by a delayed but repeated ICU-like resuscitation procedure with fluids and
antibiotics; this refined model allows us to investigate long-term physical dysfunction among sepsis survivors.
Our main approach is to combine this long-term sepsis survivor model with rat spinal contusion model to mimic
either “primary” (Aim 1) or “secondary” (Aim 2) sepsis after SCI. Our central hypothesis is that the cumulative
effects of sepsis plus SCI will impair spontaneous motor recovery, limit spinal cord tissue sparing, exacerbate
skeletal muscle weakness, and increase mortality. Two specific Aims are designed to test this hypothesis. In
Aim 1, we will induce sepsis immediately after SCI to mimic “primary” sepsis by CS injection followed by ICU-
like resuscitation initiated at 8 hrs. To mimic “secondary” sepsis, in Aim 2, we will induce sepsis at 6 weeks after
SCI by CS injection and resuscitation initiated at 8hrs after sepsis induction. SCI animals in Aim 1 will undergo
weekly locomotor testing for 6 weeks and in Aim 2, for a total of 12 weeks (6 weeks before sepsis induction and
6 weeks after) to assess spontaneous recovery. After final locomotor assessments, survivors will be subjected
to ex vivo muscle force testing, histological examination, and mitochondrial function analyses to assess muscle
weakness. Spinal cord tissue will be used for quantitative histology of spared gray and white matter as well as
lesion volume that will be correlated with locomotor recovery. Successful development of this model will allow
us to investigate detailed molecular/physiological mechanisms of sepsis following SCI, with a long-term goal of
developing therapeutic strategies to improve quality of life in the afflicted population. Success of this project is
assured by our strong multi-disciplinary team including Drs. Patel (MPI, SCI researcher), Saito (MPI, sepsis
researcher), Butterfield (Co-I, muscle researcher) and Stromberg (Co-I, biostatistician)."
10786141,"Bordetella pertussis, the bacterial pathogen responsible for “whooping cough” causes an
estimated 24 million cases of vaccine-preventable illness per year, resulting in an excess of
170,000 deaths annually. Importantly, the incidence of whooping cough in nations with high
vaccine coverage is on the rise, attributed to asymptomatic transmission that is enabled by the
imperfect and waning immunity of current acellular pertussis vaccines. Due to these and other
factors, both the CDC and NIH have listed B. pertussis as a priority (re)emerging pathogen of high
concern. B. pertussis efficiently colonizes and grows within the human respiratory tract,
requiring that it access and cross mucus and sol layers to find, tightly attach to and grow on
ciliated epithelial cells. These abilities are critical to its remarkable success, but are difficult
to study in detail in vivo. They have been studied primarily in submerged cell culture, with
monolayers of host cells and B. pertussis all submerged in rich mammalian cell growth media.
These conditions do not replicate the structure or function of the columnar airway epithelia
and completely lack the overlying mucus, sol and air-interface of a natural airway, and the
milieu in which B. pertussis naturally grows. Our team has decades of experience with
Bordetella spp and with polarized primary culture from human broncho-tracheal tissues which
contains representative cell types, most importantly including cilia beating within protective
mucus and sol layers. Here, for the first time, we will use this air-liquid interface (ALI) system,
combined with techniques in genetics and biology of B. pertussis, to probe the roles of key
bacterial factors in host-pathogen interactions with realistic human respiratory epithelia.
Specifically, we propose three aims to (1) identify factors that mediate infiltration through
mucosal layers and enable bacterial growth on ciliated epithelia, (2) define the effect of B.
pertussis factors on inducing and/or modulating epithelial cell produced pro/anti-inflammatory
signals, and (3) determine how B. pertussis damages cells and disrupts the epithelial barrier.
The data generated from these studies will reveal the roles of specific B. pertussis factors in
various measurable aspects of their interactions with ciliated respiratory epithelia and should
inform the choice of new vaccine targets capable of interrupting the airway interactions."

The opioid epidemic is a public health emergency, and 91% of misused opioids originate from provider
prescriptions. Left-over post-operative opioids are a major source of misuse and diversion: 70% of pills
prescribed go unused, but only 9% are disposed appropriately. Interventions to date have focused on limiting
prescription duration, implementing prescription guidelines, and strategies to promote disposal of unused pills.
These piecemeal approaches have shown mixed efficacy in studies and clinical practice and are insufficient in
isolation. A more all-encompassing solution would ideally limit prescription size, securely store pills, provide
guidance on safe opioid use and tapering, and offer an easy method for unused pill disposal to prevent diversion.
In partnership with Addinex Tech, we have developed a novel pill-dispensing system (PDS) for post-operative
opioid use, centered around an inexpensive, password-protected device. The mechanical device is associated
with a smartphone application (app) that provides patients with one-time passwords to dispense opioid tablets
from the device as needed, on a prescriber-defined schedule. The app also provides clinical guidance for pain
management based on patient-reported pain levels and suggests opioid tapering strategies when indicated.
When patients no longer require opioids for pain, the device can be mailed in a prepaid envelope for disposal.
In a pilot study of 30 patients who underwent major cancer-related surgery, 24 (80%) returned the device. Out
of 567 total opioid pills prescribed, 397 (70%) went unused, and 332 (84%) of those were disposed of by mail.
Building off these encouraging results, and in response to Program Announcement (PA-21-110) we propose a
prospective cohort study of this technology in 140 patients who undergo major cancer-related surgery. Since our
pilot study, we have expanded the reach of our PDS: the app is now supported by multiple operating systems
and is available in Spanish. These improvements will enable the enrollment of a more diverse patient cohort and
will increase the generalizability of the findings. We will assess rates of device return and unused pill disposal,
as well as the impact of the PDS on reducing opioid consumption and refills. We will concomitantly evaluate the
PDS from the patient perspective, in terms of pain control quality, implementation science measures of
acceptability, and qualitative measures of patient satisfaction. Our cost-effective PDS has the potential to
meaningfully reduce post-operative opioid misuse and diversion while preserving pain control. The results of this
study will inform a large, randomized trial of our system."

Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is the major cause of alcohol-related mortality and encompasses
steatosis, steatohepatitis with or without progressive fibrosis, hepatocellular injury, and loss of liver function.
Despite considerable research, the specific mechanisms underlying ALD development and progression have not
been fully elucidated, partly due to the lack of in vitro and in vivo model systems that recapitulate human ALD.
While live mice are used to model features of human ALD, current models are labor-intensive, induce significant
mortality (unlike humans), include diets that induce confounding non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and/or cannot
reproduce all features of human ALD. In contrast, we developed a simple-to-administer 16-week western diet
alcohol (WDA) model that recapitulates the inflammatory, fibrotic, and gene expression aspects of human
alcohol-associated steatohepatitis (ASH). However, it is difficult to investigate the direct effects of alcohol on
multiple liver cell types and elucidate the cell-cell interactions important for ALD pathogenesis in vivo. In contrast,
while primary liver cells can be isolated with high purity from livers to build in vitro models, they rapidly lose
phenotypic functions in 2D monocultures. To mitigate this limitation, we utilized high-throughput droplet
microfluidics to fabricate highly monodisperse extracellular matrix (ECM)-based engineered 3D liver microtissues
containing hepatocytes and liver non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) that functionally outperform conventional self-
assembled cell spheroids and cells embedded within bulk gels. Here, we will leverage the above advances to
test the novel hypothesis that microtissues containing multiple primary mouse liver cells can recapitulate the
critical features of ASH as in the WDA mouse. In aim 1, we will fabricate and optimize long-term (4+ weeks) 3D
liver microtissues containing primary mouse hepatocytes, liver endothelial cells, hepatic stellate cells, and
Kupffer cells; the role of ECM and tissue size will be investigated towards inducing high (physiologic) and stable
cell functions. We will further assess the effects of in vitro ethanol exposure on each cell type within microtissues.
In aim 2, we will investigate cell-cell interactions in liver microtissues derived from cells isolated from the WDA
mice. Microtissues will be cultured with or without ethanol and cellular functions as well as single cell RNA
sequencing data will be compared to control microtissues and existing RNA sequencing data from freshly
isolated cells from WDA mice. We will further examine the role of each of the alcohol-specific NPC type in
maintaining hepatic function and regulating inflammatory responses and fibrogenesis in microtissues. Our efforts
will yield a first-of-its-kind in vitro organotypic mouse liver model with long-term functions, which will be utilized
to elucidate the direct effects of alcohol on multiple liver cell types, the extent to which the ALD disease
phenotype can be maintained in culture, and the effects of liver NPCs on hepatocellular functions in ALD. Our
platform could serve as a resource to other investigators, and could be coupled with other tissue types (e.g.,
intestine) within microfluidic systems to elucidate the role of organ-organ crosstalk in progressive ALD."

Aging is a major risk factor for breast cancer and 80% of breast cancer cases are diagnosed after age 50.
Currently in the US, there are more than 3.8 million breast cancer survivors, and this number is expected to
increase dramatically due to the aging of the population. Chemotherapy is a highly effective treatment for breast
cancer but is associated with acute and long-term cardiovascular toxicity that may accelerate cardiovascular
aging, thus setting the stage for premature development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Aerobic exercise is
recommended for CVD prevention, however, evidence on the optimal exercise prescription in breast cancer
survivors is limited. Breast cancer survivors often suffer from long-lasting cancer therapy-related side effects
(e.g., physical dysfunction, severe fatigue, muscle weakness, peripheral neuropathy, and balance impairments)
that may be compounded by age-related frailty and mobility issues (50% of breast cancer survivors are older
than age 60). These unique challenges may limit exercise feasibility, adherence, and in turn efficacy. High-
intensity interval training (HIIT) is attracting increasing attention as a time-efficient and potentially superior
aerobic exercise strategy for CVD prevention compared to moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) in
clinical populations. We have recently adapted HIIT and MICT on an all-extremity non-weight-bearing exercise
(ANE) ergometer that eliminates balance concerns and distributes work between the upper and lower
extremities, compensating for weakness and fatigue. Our HIIT-ANE and MICT-ANE regimens are novel and
innovative exercise interventions for breast cancer survivors. Our central hypothesis is that HIIT-ANE will result
in greater and more durable improvements in endothelial and cardiac function compared with MICT-ANE and
usual care (UC) in breast cancer survivors who have recently completed chemotherapy. The aims of this
application are to conduct a randomized controlled trial to investigate: 1) the short-term and prolonged effects of
HIIT-ANE, MICT-ANE and UC on endothelial and cardiac function; and 2) the durability of the endothelial and
cardiac effects of HIIT-ANE vs. MICT-ANE. Women, 50 years of age and older, who have completed
chemotherapy within the past 6 months for primary, invasive, non-metastatic, stage I-III breast cancer will be
randomized to 1 of 3 groups: HIIT-ANE, MICT-ANE or UC. Exercise training will be performed 3 days/week over
12 weeks under supervision. The primary focus will be on endothelial and cardiac function assessed by flow-
mediated dilation and global longitudinal strain, respectively. Assessments will be performed at baseline, after
the 12-week exercise intervention and after a 12-week observation period. To gain mechanistic insight, we will
investigate circulating blood biomarkers and key biomarkers in endothelial cells harvested using a state-of-the-
art endovascular technique. This exploratory/developmental R21 will provide early evidence on whether our
promising HIIT-ANE is more effective in mitigating CVD risk than MICT-ANE and UC following breast cancer
chemotherapy. Our findings will lay the foundation for designing a rigorous full-scale clinical trial."

The objective of this translational project is to test the effects of acute stress induction on cognitive flexibility
and habit learning among individuals with AUD compared to matched controls. Towards elucidating the
complex interplay between alcohol and stress, it is crucial to elucidate brain circuitry and mechanisms that
underlie how alcohol and stress interact across a range of domains. To date, much of our understanding of
such mechanisms is confined to the preclinical level of analysis. To advance the translational impact of the
science of stress and AUD, this application proposes an investigation in a clinical sample with AUD, combining
careful experimental manipulations of stress induction, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and a
well-defined assessment of decision making. We propose to test the effects of acute stress induction on
cognitive flexibility (i.e., Wisconsin Card Sort Task; WCST) and habit learning (i.e., Sequential Decision-Making
Task; SDMT) in a sample of 64 individuals, 32 non-treatment seeking individuals with AUD and 32 matched
controls (no AUD). All participants will complete a chronic stress-informed battery. Baseline measures of
cognitive flexibility and habit learning (WCST and SDMT) will be collected. Eligible participants will complete a
neuroimaging-based stress-induction task, immediately preceded and followed by assessments of cognitive
flexibility and habit learning (WCST and SDMT). The overarching goal is to test whether response to an acute
stress induction is associated with decreases on cognitive flexibility and increases in habit learning in
individuals with AUD compared to matched controls. If the study hypotheses are supported and acute stress
decreases cognitive flexibility and enhances habit learning in individuals with AUD, compared to matched
controls, we will undertake large scale (R01-level) studies in which both stress/neural conditions and decision-
making measures are completed using neuroimaging paradigms so that neurocircuitry of both stress response
and decision-making can be interrogated."

unintended functional consequences, including disruption of genes due to off-target mutations, transgene
insertions, or deletions, duplications, or structural rearrangements. As a result, current draft guidance from the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that genome-edited cellular therapies be evaluated for both
on- and off-target mutations. However, existing approaches for performing these analyses are logistically
complicated and either use antiquated methods or involve modifications to the editing process that cannot be
applied to cellular drug products that will be used in patients. We hypothesize that whole-genome sequencing
(WGS) is an ideal platform to address FDA guidelines for genomic analysis of genome-edited cellular
products because it detects the full spectrum of mutation types and can be used to evaluate fully
manufactured ‘patient-ready’ cellular therapies. Here we propose to develop a comprehensive WGS assay
specifically designed to characterize mutations in genome-edited human cells. In Aim 1, we will modify our
recently developed clinical WGS assay for somatic mutations (ChromoSeq) to measure the efficiency and
specificity of genome editing in human cells. We will use high coverage (>250x) WGS of paired edited and
unedited control cells and joint somatic variant calling methods to quantify on-target editing efficiency and detect
transgene integration sites and unintended single nucleotide variants, insertions/deletions (indels), and
chromosomal rearrangements. We will then qualify this WGS approach using a dataset of high confidence
mutations generated in three human cell lines with CRISPR/Cas9 and multiplex pools of guide RNAs (gRNA),
which will be identified via iGUIDE and targeted, error-corrected deep sequencing. In Aim 2, we will use our
WGS assay to define the landscape of mutations in genome-edited human CAR-T cells. These will include 5
replicate experiments with reagents to common CAR-T targets, and 15 existing primary human CAR-T products
edited at a range of therapeutically relevant genes that have already been generated in our labs. We will use
these data to generate a benchmark dataset of on-target editing efficiency measurements, CAR integration sites,
and unintended mutations in human CAR-T cells that will provide valuable data for future clinical trials. Finally,
we will analyze up to 20 additional genome-edited cellular products from the Somatic Cell Genome Editing
Consortium to further establish the performance and utility of WGS for evaluating the safety and efficacy of
genome-edited cellular therapies that will enable future investigational clinical studies."
10783817,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Premature birth is a leading cause of infant mortality in the United States, and lung immaturity in these babies
is a major cause. As the organ of gas exchange, efficient lung function is critical for the survival of the
newborn. At birth, premature lungs are in the saccular developmental stage, an immature state compared to
the mature adult lungs. These immature lungs are first exposed to airborne material and microbes at birth, and
thus need to be poised for defense. Dendritic cells (DC) play a key role in this barrier defense and initiating
immunity, however, our understanding of DCs in these immature lungs is limited. My investigations into
newborn lungs have revealed previously unknown phenotypic heterogeneity within the early-life DC
compartment. Furthermore, these newborn lung DC subsets are transcriptionally distinct from their
counterparts in later neonatal stages. Together our data support the idea that the DC compartment in saccular
stage lungs is phenotypically and functionally distinct from the adult. These observations lead to our
hypothesize that newborn lungs contain phenotypically and functionally heterogeneous stage-specific
lung DCs. This hypothesis will be addressed through the following specific aims: Aim1: interrogate the
ontogeny of saccular stage lung DCs, and Aim 2: Determine the functions of saccular stage DCs. Both of these
aims will be performed in comparison to other lung development stages, including mature lungs. These aims
will elucidate the saccular stage DC compartment in terms of ontogeny and function, and will reveal its
significance in neonatal lung inflammation. The proposed research will be the first comprehensive analysis of
the lung DC compartment at birth and its role in inflammation."

The overall goal of the UM-OAIC Pilot and Exploratory Studies Core (PESC) is to provide critical initial funding
for pilot and exploratory studies that are consistent with the Center’s overall goal, which is to build on the
scientific and therapeutic applications of exercise and rehabilitation by: 1) advancing our understanding of the
mechanisms by which exercise, activity-based, and rehabilitation interventions directed at specific impairments
affect multiple body systems underlying functional performance; and 2) developing and testing interventions to
restore function and minimize disability from acute and chronic serious diseases in older adults. To
accomplish these goals, we propose: 1) To solicit and select high-quality innovative pilot and exploratory
studies (PES) that are consistent with the overall UM-OAIC goal; and 2) support the implementation of these
innovative and promising PES through the utilization of PESC and UM-OAIC resources. These resources are
structured to support the successful design and implementation of PES and include: Research Design Studios
to provide specific methodological expertise; Project Implementation Support Groups to ensure prompt and
efficient initiation of research projects; and multidisciplinary Research Working Groups to provide mentoring
and guide and assist investigators in conducting their projects, reporting results, and developing future
investigations. Pilot study awardees will further leverage the resources from the UM-OAIC Resource Cores
along with allied programs and centers at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, the larger University System of
Maryland, and nationally through collaboration with other OAICs. PES will be selected through a rigorous
peer review process led by the Research Education Advisory Panel, with reviewers selected from the External
Advisory Board, leaders from other OAICs, and a member of the Core Leadership Executive Committee. Input
will also be solicited from the Community Advisory Board to ensure that projects are relevant in older adults
and their caregivers from diverse communities in Baltimore and the State of Maryland. Three innovative
projects will be selected for funding in the first year of this competitive renewal, led by PIs from the
Departments of Epidemiology and Public Health, Orthopedics, and Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine.
These projects will investigate: 1) The intersection of depression and pain on functional outcomes in knee
osteoarthritis, utilizing data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative; 2) cell mechanics as a mechanism of biological
age, using translational methods to examine microtubular structure and cystokeletal stiffness as markers of
biological age in pre-clinical and human models; and 3) a pilot-level randomized controlled trial of telemedicine
and telerehabilitation in older Intensive Care Unit survivors on functional outcomes, rehospitalization, and
ambulatory clinic retention. The results obtained from these pilot and exploratory studies will provide key
preliminary data to support grant applications for extramural funding for larger, more definitive investigator-
initiated studies."

The purpose of the Research Education Core (REC) is to foster the career development of junior faculty from
multiple disciplines into scientists focusing on the restoration of function in order to improve function in those
with impairments and prevent or delay further progression in those who are already disabled (i.e., enablement).
The REC supports Scholars and affiliated faculty (who are former Scholars or junior faculty with career
development awards related to our mission) in mentor-based research training and other activities which
create a supportive research community.
The UM-OAIC has a successful 25-year history of training that crosses traditional disciplinary boundaries to
develop scientists conducting novel research to maintain and improve independence in older adults. The UM-
OAIC REC has several unique elements:
• It attracts and brings together junior faculty from multiple backgrounds, departments and schools at UM in
 Baltimore, Baltimore County and (soon) College Park into a supportive research community;
• it uses a structured Faculty Development Plan, which enhances training experiences, to guide and
 measure Scholar’s progress;
• it integrates the UM-OAIC with other UM career development programs to create group and individualized
 training in functional impairments in older adults and scientific communication for each Scholar; and
• it develops Research Working Groups, individualized to each Scholar’s project, to pursue and facilitate
 interdisciplinary studies focused on bi-directional translational research projects related to the UM-OAIC
theme.
The outcomes of this training program for the Scholar include the preliminary data and peer reviewed
publications for a successful career development award application.
The specific aims of the REC are to: 1) Recruit and retain REC Scholars and affiliated faculty committed to
research careers congruent with the UM-OAIC mission; 2) Train REC Scholars and affiliated faculty through
mentored research projects and individualized training plans which use the resources of the UM-OAIC, the
national OAIC network and other NIA supported programs; 3) Develop a Leadership Academy to prepare the
next generation of scientist to lead research on older adults; and 4) Evaluate the UM-OAIC REC. With this
renewal, the REC is on the forefront of research training and developing junior faculty into scientists that solve
the clinical problems that result in the loss of independence for older adults."
10897913,"CORE A – SUMMARY
The Administrative Core (Core A) will oversee and coordinate all administrative and research activities within
this program. All project leaders have primary faculty appointments in the Gladstone Institute of Neurological
Disease (GIND), which Dr. Mucke has directed since its inauguration in 1998. His leadership of this institute,
joint appointments in the Department of Neurology and various graduate training programs at UCSF, and long
record of service on relevant national and international advisory committees put him in an excellent position to
lead this core. He has collaborated with Drs. Yadong Huang (Project 1) and Jorge Palop (Project 2) on
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) research for roughly two decades, as highlighted by many widely cited, coauthored
publications in this field, and recently recruited Dr. Ryan Corces (Project 3 and Core B) to Gladstone and UCSF.
For many years, he has also interacted closely with Drs. Katie Pollard and Alex Pico (Core B) through their
leadership roles in Gladstone’s Bioinformatics Core. The well-established relationships among project and core
leaders will greatly help Core A to accomplish its overall goal of overseeing, coordinating, and supporting studies
proposed in all projects and cores. This program project will focus squarely on AD and places great emphasis
on cohesiveness and collaborative interactions among projects. Core A will critically support and enforce these
features and help ensure that our program not only addresses truly important biomedical problems, but also
creates diverse opportunities for scientific growth and advancement in AD-relevant research for all of its
members, ranging from graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to junior and senior faculty. Specifically, Core
A will develop and implement program-wide procedures to ensure optimal levels of scientific rigor, data safety,
cost effectiveness, and accountability across all four projects and the scientific core; encourage and facilitate
collaborative interactions among all project and core leaders as well as between program members and other
groups with related interests at Gladstone, UCSF, and beyond; survey relevant resources and fields of research
and alert project and core leaders to conceptual or technological developments that could enhance the pursuit
of their specific aims; form an external advisory committee and arrange regular meetings to review the program
and provide constructive feedback to all project and core leaders; prepare progress reports; coordinate
publications among program members; and collaborate with Core B to ensure the efficient dissemination of
program-generated data, reagents, and research findings to the broader scientific community."
10897917,"CORE B – ABSTRACT
This program aims to discover the molecular drivers and consequences of network dysfunction in Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) through rigorous characterization of cell-type specific gene regulation and multi-modal phenotypes.
We will use human samples and a variety of mouse models. This breadth and depth of data across different
organismal and cellular contexts present a unique opportunity for integrative modeling. To capitalize on this
opportunity, however, the data must be quantitatively comparable across projects. To address this challenge,
the Integrative Data-Science Core (Core B) will use the “design for inference” approach, which means that the
predictive modeling and hypothesis testing we plan to do will guide all stages of experimental design. To minimize
and correct batch effects, we will standardize experimental protocols and establish a repeated-measures
experimental design, which will boost the power for analyses. A second challenge is how to summarize and
jointly model complex, high-dimensional phenotypes with single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptomic profiles.
To solve this problem, we will develop innovative machine-learning and network models, with a focus on deep
learning and sparse canonical correlation analysis to extract information from multivariate data and discover
relationships between pairs of data types. To facilitate real-time sharing of results and exploration of data across
projects, we will implement data tracking systems, Jupyter notebooks with pipelines and analytical code, and an
interactive data portal with visualization and query capabilities. These collaborative tools will also help us share
our data, code, and results rapidly with the AD research community through our Synapse website. Collectively,
the activities of Core B will provide cutting-edge computational support to all four projects, enable cross-project
discovery, and set new standards for the use of large-scale data integration to decipher molecular mechanisms
in AD and other diseases."
10897921,"PROJECT 1 – SUMMARY
The complexity and multifactorial nature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pose unique challenges for mechanistic
studies and developing therapies. Although the three major pathogenic factors of AD—amyloid-beta peptides,
tau, and apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4)—have been extensively studied as independent entities in AD pathogenesis,
efforts to target individual AD-related pathways, such as Ab production or clearance, have largely failed in human
trials. Emerging evidence strongly suggests that AD is a consequence of age-dependent neural network
dysfunction in brain regions that mostly affect cognition, likely through the interactive effects of multiple
pathogenic factors. Thus, there is a pressing need to identify novel mechanisms and therapeutic targets, at a
neural network level and in the context of interactions between multiple pathogenic factors—the focus of this
proposal.
 APOE4, which encodes one of the three major isoforms of apoE in humans, is the major genetic risk factor for
AD and lowers the age of onset in a gene dose-dependent manner. In most clinical studies, APOE4 carriers
account for 60–75% of AD cases, highlighting the importance of APOE4 in AD pathogenesis. On the other hand,
many clinical and population studies show that APOE2, encoding the rarest apoE isoform, is a strongly protective
genetic factor in AD. A pathological hallmark of AD is the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) consisting
of hyperphosphorylated, insoluble tau, containing both 3R and 4R tau isoforms. In cell cultures and mouse
models, apoE isoforms have tau-dependent differential effects, and tau has apoE isoform-dependent effects,
suggesting interactive roles in AD pathogenesis. However, almost all of these studies of apoE isoforms and tau
drew conclusions based either on mouse tau, which is present almost exclusively as 4R tau, or on mutant human
tau, which is associated with frontotemporal dementia but not AD. In Project 1, we propose to determine cell-
type-specific, differential roles of apoE isoforms in age-dependent neural network dysfunction and behavioral
deficits, in the context of wildtype (WT) human tau (both 3R and 4R tau isoforms), in novel mouse models of AD.
 In Aim 1, we will determine differential roles of apoE isoforms in neural network dysfunction and behavioral
deficits, using apoE-isoform-floxed knock-in (APOEfE2/fE2 [fE2], APOEfE3/fE3 [fE3], and APOEfE4/fE4 [fE4]) mice
expressing WT human tau (MAPT knock-in or TAUWT) at different ages. In Aim 2, we will determine cell-type-
specific, differential roles of apoE isoforms in neural network dysfunction and behavioral deficits, using
fE2/TAUWT, fE3/TAUWT, and fE4/TAUWT mice expressing cell-type-specific Cre recombinase (neuron-specific
Cresyn1, astrocyte-specific CreGFAP, and microglia-specific CreCx3cr1) in order to delete the APOE allele in a cell-
type-specific manner. The studies in this project, together with those of the three other projects of this program
project grant, will yield new insights into the multifactorial pathogenesis of AD and may identify neural network-
based targets for apoE isoform–dependent and cell type-specific therapies to treat or prevent AD."
10897926,"PROJECT 2 – SUMMARY
Numerous lines of evidence suggest that human amyloid precursor protein/amyloid b (APP/Ab), apoE4, and the
microtubule-associated protein tau contribute to Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but their pathogenic interactions are
largely unknown. Reducing Ab accumulation in the brain was considered the most reasonable therapeutic
strategy for AD, but multiple clinical trials of this approach have failed, suggesting that the pathophysiology of
AD is much more complex than anticipated and that the pathogenic interactions of AD-relevant proteins need to
be better understood. To decode the multifactorial etiology of AD at physiological levels of expression, we will
study newly developed knock-in (KI) mouse models of late-onset (LOAD) and familial (FAD) AD without
transgene overexpression and focus on the pathogenic interactions between Ab, apoE, and tau. To simulate
LOAD, we will use KI mice that express humanized wildtype Ab without FAD mutations (ApphAβWT/hAβWT; referred
to as Aβ mice), human apoE isoforms (APOEE2/E2, APOEE3/E3, and APOEE4/E4; E2, E3, and E4 mice), and human
wildtype tau (MAPTWT/WT, TAUWT mice). To simulate FAD, we will use KI mice that express humanized wildtype
Ab with the Swedish and Iberian FAD mutations (AppNL-F/NL-F; ↑Ab mice), human apoE isoforms (E3 and E4), and
human wildtype tau (TAUWT). Thus, we propose to study the physiological and endogenous interactions of human
Ab, apoE isoforms, and tau in vivo that contribute to AD-related abnormalities in neural network activity, cognitive
functions, gene expression, and histopathology using state-of-the-art in vivo electrophysiological, optogenetics,
and behavioral approaches. We will focus on mechanisms of altered neural network dysfunction, since they
closely relate to brain and cognitive functions and are disrupted early in AD pathogenesis.
In Aim 1, we will determine pathogenic interactions of Ab, apoE isoforms, and tau contributing to altered neural
network activity (Aim 1a) and behavioral deficits (Aim 1b) in LOAD and FAD KI mice during disease progression
using wireless long-term EEG/EMG recordings and standard and machine learning behavioral approaches. In
Aim 2, we will determine pathogenic interactions of Ab and apoE4 contributing to cell and circuit function
impairments in LOAD and FAD KI mice in vivo (Aim 2a, b) and if optogenetic activation of specific interneuron
cell types reverses AD-related abnormalities (Aim 2c). We will use in vivo LFP and multi-unit recordings and
optogenetic approaches in behaving mice to identify cell type and circuit-level mechanisms of network
dysfunction. In Aim 3, we will determine pathogenic interactions of Ab, apoE isoforms, and tau contributing to
AD-related pathology (Aim 3a) and scRNA-seq transcriptome changes (Aim 3b) in LOAD and FAD KI mice. We
will perform AD-related pathological and scRNA-seq transcriptomics analyses in functionally characterized mice
(in vivo physiology and behavior) from Aims 1 and 2 to identify pathological and transcriptome changes
associated with cognitive vulnerability and resilience. We aim to identify human validated and behaviorally
relevant candidate genes/pathways of AD pathogenesis and define cell-type-specific disease mechanisms."
10897930,"PROJECT 3 – SUMMARY
Tau contributes to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and many other brain diseases. However, it is uncertain how tau
causes neuronal dysfunction and degeneration, in part because experimental models are not optimized to
compare the relative pathogenicity of different tau species in disease-relevant contexts. Mutations in MAPT, the
gene encoding tau, cause frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) instead of AD. In contrast, the rare A152T
variant of tau increases risk for both types of diseases. These associations merit further exploration, especially
as models expressing FTLD-mutant tau are widely used to study tau in AD and to develop novel AD treatments.
Clinical AD onset is preceded by abnormal accumulations of amyloid-b (Ab) peptides in brain, and many AD
patients have at least one apolipoprotein (apo) E4 allele, the most important genetic risk factor for AD. Therefore,
we will generate new mouse models combining human Ab and apoE4 expression with near-physiological levels
of human tau that is (1) wildtype, as in most AD patients, (2) carries the A152T substitution, which increases AD
risk, or (3) bears the P301S mutation, which causes FTLD and is widely used in overexpression models.
Comprehensive functional, pathological, and transcriptomic analyses of the new models, in collaboration with
Projects 1, 2, and 4 and Core B, should yield new insights into differential effects of these tau species and their
roles in the pathogenesis of dementia. We hypothesize that tau species that increase AD risk or cause FTLD
differ in their effects on the integrity and function of neurons and neural networks, especially when combined
with Aβ and apoE4. Until we know which forms of tau are most pathogenic in different conditions, the most
pragmatic therapeutic approach to tau in our view is partial reduction of overall tau levels, which is well tolerated
and has benefits in conventional models. We will therefore use tau-targeting antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs)
to (1) determine whether reducing human tau can diminish neural network dysfunction, neurodegeneration and
cognitive decline in models co-expressing human Ab and apoE4, (2) define the optimal timing for this
intervention, and (3) reveal the most critical co-pathogenic mechanisms of tau. We hypothesize that ASO-
mediated tau reduction will diminish not only tau pathology in one or more of the new models, but also synaptic
deficits, neural network dysfunction, and cognitive deficits, even though it is unlikely to reduce amyloid deposition
or plaque-associated microgliosis. This experiment should help determine when tau reduction must be initiated
relative to the onset of cognitive deficits for it to have therapeutic benefits in AD-relevant contexts. Single-
nucleus/single-cell transcriptomic analyses will be used to identify cell-type-specific gene expression changes
and novel molecular and cellular mechanisms that may mediate pathogenic effects of tau or beneficial effects of
tau reduction. These analyses will also help Projects 1 and 2 distinguish between pathogenic mechanisms of
apoE4 and Ab that do or do not depend on tau and could identify novel molecular and cellular mechanisms that
mediate tau sequence-specific effects in the absence or presence of AD-relevant co-pathogens."
10670562,"Low back pain, which is commonly caused by intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration, is the most common
source of chronic pain in Veterans. Current clinical treatments for disc degeneration, including spinal fusion,
are limited in that they do not restore healthy disc structure or function. To overcome this limitation, our group
has developed a whole, tissue engineered endplate-modified disc-like angle ply structure (eDAPS) composed
of engineered annulus fibrosus, nucleus pulposus and endplate regions. To date, we have completed the
long-term evaluation of the eDAPS in a small animal model, in addition to short-term evaluation in a large
animal, goat cervical disc replacement model. The parent Merit Award will evaluate how these engineered
discs function in a degenerative model, as well as their maturation over longer implantation times and with
remobilization of the spinal motion segment. Despite the promise of these engineered implants, the
inflammatory responses within the eDAPs and their potential for modulating inflammatory biological processes
within the intervertebral disc have yet to be evaluated. Thus, the overarching goal of this supplemental Award
is to evaluate the inflammatory milieu of the degenerating IVD in a large animal model, and to determine the
potential for an eDAPS implant to reset this milieu to enhance regeneration with remobilization. We will achieve
this goal via the following Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1: Evaluate the inflammatory responses during intervertebral disc degeneration in a large animal
model. In this Aim we will induce degeneration in the goat cervical intervertebral disc via a previously validated
chondroitinase ABC injection degeneration model. Following induced degeneration, at 3 months, we will then
perform an in-depth analysis of the inflammatory responses involved in degenerative pathology by utilizing next
generation sequencing at the single cell level.
Specific Aim 2: Determine the immunomodulatory effect of an engineered disc replacement either following
injury or following remobilization of the disc replacement. To evaluate the immunomodulatory effect of
engineered disc replacements following degeneration (Aim 2a) we will again induce degeneration in the goat
cervical intervertebral disc. After the induced degeneration, at 3 months, a second surgery will be performed to
implant the eDAPS. Animals will be euthanized after 1 year of eDAPs implantation, and compared to animals
which underwent chondroitinase ABC injection but did not have eDAPs implantation. At the 1 year study
endpoints, immunophenotyping and inflammatory assessment will be carried out via single cell sequencing
followed by validation of specific cellular markers by immunohistochemical analysis. To evaluate whether the
mechanical loading environment influences the immunomodulatory effect of eDAPs (Aim 2b), we will utilize
remobilization surgeries following implantation. eDAPs will be implanted in the goat cervical spine and
immobilized via an internal metal fixation plate. A second surgery will remove the plate either 2 weeks or 2
months post-implantation. A set of implanted eDAPs will remain fixed and serve as a control. All animals will be
sacrificed 6 months following the initial eDAPs implantation. Immunophenotyping and inflammatory
assessment will be carried out via cytometric analyses and/or immunohistochemical analysis of inflammatory
and immune cell markers across whole IVD sections to determine how loading impacts the inflammatory state
of the engineered implant.
Overall, the proposed work will significantly improve the understanding of the immunomodulatory potential of
the eDAPs, as well as provide insight into the effect of mechanical loading on inflammatory responses within
the implanted eDAPs. This work contributes to a larger body of work which significantly drives the translation of
the eDAPs implant towards clinical use and advances the state of the art in spine therapeutics."

10893340,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pregnant adolescents face synergistic challenges in the context of HIV – heightened risk of maternal infection,
vertical transmission, and maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality compared to adult women living with HIV –
and a largely absent evidence base to inform prevention and treatment strategies. Despite increasing global
attention on HIV among adolescent girls and young women, and strong consensus around the urgent need to
attend to pregnant women in the HIV research agenda, persisting complexities at the intersection of pregnancy
and adolescence have amplified reticence around their inclusion in research. This project seeks to address
these questions and confusions around the ethical permissibility of including pregnant adolescents in research.
To this end, we will build on the substantial contributions our team has made through the R01 NIAID funded
PHASES Project (Pregnancy and HIV/AIDS: Seeking Equitable Study), which developed an Ethics Guidance
to advance the responsible inclusion of adult pregnant women in research to prevent and treat HIV/co-
infections. Building on PHASES findings and core consensus principles in PHASES Ethics Guidance, our goal
is to provide empirically informed guidance for conducting ethically responsible HIV/co-infections research with
pregnant adolescents. To achieve this goal, PHASES Adolescence aims: 1) To identify scientific priorities in,
perceived barriers and enablers to conducting HIV/co-infections prevention and treatment research with
pregnant adolescents through interviews and engagement with stakeholders in the HIV research and advocacy
communities in the US and Southern Africa, including investigators, community advisory board members, and
HIV youth advocates and; and to characterize reasoning around participation in such studies from the
viewpoints of affected adolescents through interviews with pregnant adolescents with or at risk for HIV in the
US and Southern Africa; 2) To identify conditions for responsible HIV/co-infections research with pregnant
adolescents that are responsive to the above priorities, barriers, enablers and viewpoints, through scholarly
ethical and regulatory analysis, and interviews and engagement with stakeholders involved in the ethical and
regulatory review and oversight of research, including ethicists, regulatory and policy experts, and research
ethics committee members; and 3) To develop an adolescence-specific framework for advancing HIV research
in pregnancy, whose utility and acceptability will be vetted by stakeholders in the HIV research and advocacy
communities, and those involved in the ethical and regulatory oversight of research, delineating when and
under what circumstances pregnant adolescents can and should be included in HIV/co-infections research.
Through a rigorous methodological design and the individual and collaborative experience of project
investigators in empirical research, moral analysis, and ethics guidance development, this project aims to
identify a clear path forward for HIV/co-infections research with pregnant adolescents, responsive to ethical
and regulatory concerns that have hampered the evidence base for this critical, neglected group."
10892101,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Tickborne illnesses continue to be a significant public health concern in the US and worldwide, as
environmental and climate changes have allowed the dramatic expansion of ticks, tick habitats, and their
mammalian hosts. In the New England region alone, Lone Star ticks were first reported in 2017, followed
by the establishment of exotic Asian longhorned ticks in 2018. A recent CDC report indicates that
tickborne diseases in the US have more than doubled from 2004 to 2016, accounting for 77% of all
reported vector-borne diseases. The report also indicates that the US is not fully prepared to prevent and
control these threats. A number of tickborne viruses that cause encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever in
humans are of particular concern in the US, such as the re-emerging Powassan virus (POWV), as well as
the recently discovered Heartland virus (HRTV). Another emerging tickborne virus in Asia is severe fever
with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), closely related to HRTV, which is transmitted by the
Asian longhorned tick that is spreading rapidly and is now present in 12 US states. A number of additional
exotic tickborne viral agents are of concern to the US, including tickborne encephalitis virus (TBEV),
Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus (OHFV), and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV). To better
prepare for these emerging threats, we assembled a team of experts in (1) vaccine development at the
University of Connecticut, (2) tickborne viruses at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, and (3)
animal models in maximum biocontainment at the National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories
and propose the development and testing of vaccines for four Risk Group 3 (RG3) and RG4 tickborne
encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever viruses classified as NIAID Category A or C Priority Pathogens, and
prioritized by the WHO under its most recent 2018 Blueprint list of priority diseases in need of accelerated
research and development. We developed a rapid method to generate vaccinia virus (VACV) vectors that
will allow us to quickly test a number of tickborne viral genes to ensure robust expression of protective
antigens and secretion of virus-like particles (VLPs). This platform is based on a gold-standard viral vector
(VACV) that induces high levels of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. These VACV vectors
are replication-defective when administered as a vaccine, yet easy to propagate in standard cell culture at
high titers, unlike other replication-defective poxvirus vectors such as MVA. We will also generate DNA-
based vaccines and purified VLPs (as a subunit vaccine), so that three different classes of vaccine
candidates can be tested for immunogenicity, either alone or in prime-boost regimens. Finally, we will test
the efficacy of the vaccines using tick-transmission animal models to recapitulate the enhancement of
transmission and dissemination that has been documented by tick feeding."
10828921,"Project Summary/Abstract: Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), which occurs up to 30% of COVID-
19 infections, has emerged as a significant healthcare issue in the US. The mechanisms, diagnostic imaging
tests, and therapies for persistent symptoms caused by PASC remain unknown. The CDC describes PASC
symptoms as difficult to explain and manage due to lack of knowledge and reliable test. This study seeks to
define the mechanism of persistent chest pain caused by PASC and establish an effective cardiac imaging test
for guiding therapy. To minimize the influence of confounders, this project focuses on well-characterized patients
with persistent chest pain, which occurs in about 20% of PASC patients. Endothelial inflammation and injury are
important manifestations of acute COVID-19 infection, which may result in chronic coronary microcirculatory
dysfunction (CMD). Stress cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is the ideal “one-stop-shop” imaging test
for PASC patients with persistent chest pain, because it does not involve ionizing radiation (i.e. safe for repetitive
surveillance), is a proven modality for CMD, and uses standard clinical MRI hardware and contrast agents.
Furthermore, it affords a comprehensive assessment of cardiovascular abnormalities, including: obstructive
coronary artery disease (coronary magnetic resonance angiography), pulmonary hemodynamics (4D flow),
myocardial inflammation (T2, T1), scar (late gadolinium enhancement), diffuse fibrosis (extracellular volume
fraction [ECV]), and contractile dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF], RVEF, strain). Recognizing
the need to account for potential confounders, we have assembled a powerful, comprehensive, CMR protocol
for imaging PASC patients. Our central hypothesis is that CMD is the mechanism for chest pain in a substantial
proportion of symptomatic PASC patients, despite having normal lung function and no history of heart disease
prior to COVID infection. To test our hypothesis, we will conduct a matched case-control study comparing MPRs
between well-characterized PASC patients with persistent chest pain, asymptomatic COVID-19 survivors
matched for sex, age, race/ethnicity, CAD risk factors, vaccine status, and severity of acute COVID illness, and
matched healthy controls. The goals of this study are: (1) to determine whether CMR-derived MPR quantification
is accurate and precise; to determine whether MPR quantification and coronary MRA adds incremental value for
diagnosing CMD; (2) to determine whether MPRs are reduced in PASC patients with chest pain due to symptom
status and/or prior COVID infection; to determine whether MPRs predict chest pain better than other CMR
indices, clinical profiles, and blood biomarkers; (3) to determine whether temporal changes in MPRs differ
between treated and untreated PASC patients; whether temporal changes in MPRs correlate with temporal
changes in angina status. This proposal has high potential impact on PASC patients suffering from chest pain
by identifying and quantifying the mechanism of persistent chest pain, informing future development and
applications of mechanism-directed therapies for CMD, and improving cardiovascular health."

Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) secondary to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents a significant
challenge in clinical patient management. MPE is commonly indicative of late stage malignancy and prognosis
of MPE is extremely poor, with a median survival between 4-9 months. The presence of MPE often precludes
surgical intervention, and many patients with MPE are not fit for chemotherapy due to the extremely poor
condition. Current standard of care treatment for MPE is largely palliative. Significant clinical evidence suggests
that the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) of MPE is profoundly immunosuppressive with abundant tumor-
promoting phenotype of immune cells, which impacts negatively on antitumor immunity. Previous attempts to
improve the TIME involving intrapleural administration of immunotherapeutics have led to some degree of
efficacy. The recent advent of immunotherapy with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has aroused renewed
interest in seeking an effective strategy to mitigate the immune cold MPE to enhance the ICB immunotherapy.
Stimulators of interferon genes (STING) pathway has recently been identified to play an important role on
induction of antitumor immunity. As a potent STING agonist, cGAMP ligates STING in cytosol to activate type I
interferons (IFNs) production. However, intrinsic property of cGAMP makes it susceptible to degradation by a
phosphodiesterase that exists in many tissues, and higher levels of the enzyme are identified in malignant
effusions. Moreover, previous studies indicate that activation of STING within tumor–resident antigen-presenting
cells (APCs) is necessary for induction of tumor-specific CD8+T cell immunity. We have recently developed a
novel nanotechonological strategy for APC-targeted delivery of cGAMP (LNP-STING). We assemble LNP-
STING with phosphatidylserine on the outer layer of liposome to facilitate its recognition and uptake preferably
by APCs, and load cGAMP complexed with calcium phosphate to enhance both the loading efficiency and the
release of cGAMP to cytosol, where it binds to STING. In this project, we propose to establish an optimal LNP-
STING for intrapleural administration and test if intrapleural LNP-STING converts the immune cold into
proinflammatory hot MPE. Our central hypothesis is that intrapleural LNP-STING enables to mitigate the
immunosuppressive MPE, thereby setting the stage for favorable response to anti-PD-L1 ICB. We will test the
combination immunotherapy in both MPE mouse models and NSCLC patients’ MPE samples. We propose to
establish an optimal LNP-STING for intrapleural APC-targeted delivery of STING agonist (Aim1). We will then
determine if intrapleural LNP-STING effectively mitigate the immune cold MPE (Aim2). We will last determine if
intrapleural LNP-STING enhances efficacy of the ICB immunotherapy (Aim3). More importantly, we will gain
insights into the biological mechanisms of intrapleural LNP-STING in combination with anti-PD-L1 ICB, which
likely engage both the innate and adaptive anticancer immunity. This work is significant because it may have a
potential to make an impact on the MPE immunotherapy."
10899539,"In response to RFA-DK-20-013 “GenitoUrinary Development Molecular Anatomy Project (GUDMAP) - Atlas
Projects”, this proposal aims “to generate data to visualize the developing urinary tract, to identify new functional
and anatomical domains, and cell types”. The embryonic hindgut or cloaca progresses from a single hollow
organ to two separate entities – the urinary tract and anorectal tract. The urinary tract further differentiates into
the bladder rostrally and the genital urethra caudally. Guided by tissue-specific gene expression patterns, we
show that several selected transcription factors and signaling molecules are critical for urinary tract development
and, are responsible for some of the most complex human birth defects. However, these low-throughput and
isolated case studies offer limited information; and it is difficult integrate these findings to discern gene-gene and
gene-cell relationships in development and in disease. Resources including spatial annotation of all genes in all
cells are needed. Using innovative technologies including single cell Multi-omics and Spatial Transcriptome, this
application aims to 1) create a series of digital libraries from all cells of mouse lower urinary tract, in which every
cell is annotated based on its' own transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles; 2) generate ultrahigh-density tissue-
specific spatial transcriptomic map of the lower urinary tract; and 3) display spatial transcriptome at near single
cell resolution onto the 3D digitalized mouse and human embryos. These resources will serve the research
community to establish a comprehensive understanding of urinary tract development, including but not limited to
cloaca septation and urinary tract differentiation."

The broad objective of this proposed work is to advance single-cell analysis by introducing novel cell-barcoding
technologies. Understanding cells is a cornerstone of life sciences. Single-cell sequencing led to a paradigm
shift in our approach to analyze cells from ensembles to individual cells. Unfortunately, the current single-cell
analysis techniques are almost exclusively static, performed ex vivo, and thus cannot easily probe the dynamic
cellular processes. Beyond static analysis, the next important step is to add more dimensions: everything that
makes a cell a living entity, including temporal changes, spatial movement, interactions with other cells in vivo.
This project will develop laser particles (LPs), which can be read optically in real time and repeatedly as
needed, for multi-dimensional single-cell analysis. With the optical barcode, it is possible to acquire data from a
cell at different times, locations and apparatuses, and compile the data to produce a full account of the cell. A
combination of LPs with oligonucleotide barcodes enables a breakthrough approach acquiring large-scale data
from in vivo physiology to molecular omics using multiple instruments in series. This project is organized in
three specific aims. Aim 1 develops large-scale LP barcodes combined with oligo barcodes. Aim 2 constructs
several instruments integrating LP barcode readers into commercial platforms. Aim 3 involves validation
studies to demonstrate the immediate utilities of the new technologies. The optical barcoding is expected to
make a paradigm change in single-cell analysis. This will transform the way multi-dimensional single-cell
analysis is used for scientific discovery and diagnostic and therapeutic applications in healthcare."

Despite the effectiveness of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in preventing HIV acquisition, PrEP is not
currently medically prescribed in Romania, although demand is rapidly growing. Evidence-based knowledge is
urgently needed to guide PrEP’s effective rollout in Romania. First, Romania has the 2nd highest increasing
HIV incidence of 15 Central-Eastern European (CEE) countries, with gay and bisexual men (GBM) being one
of the few epidemic-driving groups; however, there is no national HIV programming for GBM. Second, in a
large 2019 GBM report, Romania was the 8th of 44 European countries with the largest gap between PrEP use
(1%) and demand (70%). Third, Romania displays some of the highest homophobic attitudes in CEE, keeping
GBM in hiding and underutilizing healthcare. Consequently, many Romanian GBM obtain PrEP on their own
and use it without medical guidance, thereby increasing their HIV and other health risks. To address the unmet
HIV-prevention needs of Romanian GBM, our established US-Romanian team proposes to introduce a
culturally-responsive pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) program in Romania. We will integrate and adapt two
tools that we developed and tested in the US 1) SPARK, an in-person motivational intervention for uptake of
and adherence to PrEP using an empowering sexual health approach; and 2) P3 (Prepared, Protected,
emPowered), a PrEP adherence support app that utilizes engaging social networking and game-based
elements, with an in-app portal for individualized live adherence counseling. We will work with our local
Partner Consortium of GBM-competent health providers and GBM to create PrEP Romania, composed of both
in-person (adapted SPARK to build initial motivation for PrEP uptake and adherence) and mHealth (adapted
P3 to provide ongoing app-based PrEP motivation, education, and adherence support) components. Aim 1
(R21). In mos 2-11, using the ADAPT-ITT Model, we will systematically combine and culturally adapt SPARK
and P3. Aim 2 (R21). In mos 12-20, we will enroll 20 GBM in a one-arm pilot to test PrEP Romania’s feasibility
(e.g., medical visit attendance), acceptability (e.g., intervention staff protocol feedback, GBM interviews about
counseling, app usability, and PrEP use), and PrEP uptake (e.g., filled prescriptions), adherence (i.e., self-
reported, biomarker verified) and persistence (i.e., still on PrEP) at 3 mos. R21-R33 Transition Aim. In mos
21-24, we will summarize PrEP Romania’s promise and anticipated R33 plans. Aim 3 (R33). In mos 1-4, we
will make necessary adjustments to PrEP Romania. In mos 5-30, we will randomize 120 PrEP-eligible GBM in
two cities to receive either 1) PrEP Romania or 2) a PrEP education condition. We will examine differences
across arms in PrEP uptake, adherence, persistence (self-reported and biomarker verified) at 3- and 6-mos
post-PrEP initiation. Aim 4 (R33). In mos 31-36, we will identify individual and institutional barriers and
facilitators of implementing PrEP Romania by examining Aim 3 feasibility and acceptability data, and via
provider, clinic director, and GBM interviews to inform a future hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial."
10914865,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Cancer is the leading disease-related cause of death in children. Treatment has remained largely unchanged
in decades, relying primarily on aggressive cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation—these therapies have
debilitating long-term consequences. Precision medicine has yet to make a major impact on childhood cancer
because, while thousands of pediatric tumor genomes have been sequenced, most children have very few
somatic mutations compared to adult cancers. This means targeted cancer drugs are not an option for most
children and fewer tumor-specific neoantigens means most immunotherapies are ineffective.
However, in the last 5 years, large-scale CRISPR and drug screening studies in cancer cell lines, such as the
Dependency Map (DepMap), have shown that in many cancers, unmutated genes can also act as potent drug
targets. These genes are known as non-oncogene dependencies. The overall goal of this project is to
overcome the low mutation burden, by identifying the druggable non-oncogene dependencies of pediatric
tumors and to perform the requisite in vitro and in vivo experimental work to move these therapies to the clinic.
We will identify these non-oncogene dependencies by applying tools from machine learning to perform
integrative analysis of large pre-clinical screening datasets (such as DepMap, CCLE, and PRISM) with patient
tumor -omics data. This will allow us to nominate specific non-oncogene dependencies for pediatric tumor
subtypes, defined based on, for example, whole-genome gene expression or methylation data. We will
mechanistically validate the top hits using in vitro experimental assays.
Additionally, almost all curative cancer treatments involve the rational combination of multiple therapies,
however, existing methods to predict effective combinations perform poorly when tested on unseen data. Thus,
our second aim is to apply an approach that we have developed based on targeted CRISPR knockout
screening to identify synergistic drug combinations. We will validate these combinations in vivo using mouse
models with patient-derived xenografts, leveraging shared resources already established at St. Jude.
Finally, tumor heterogeneity is ultimately the downfall of every known cancer treatment; however, in pediatric
tumors where the mutation burden is low, much of this heterogeneity is driven by cell state, rather than specific
somatic mutations. We will dissect the influence of cell state on drug resistance using single-cell and spatial
transcriptomics technologies applied to a drug-treated spontaneous mouse model of neuroblastoma. This will
ultimately allow us to nominate new drug combinations explicitly targeting drug-resistant cell states.
Overall, this research program will aim to build a pipeline at St. Jude to overcome some of the main challenges
posed by the low number of somatic mutations in pediatric tumors and identify new therapeutic strategies for
these patients. We have assembled a diverse world-class team of researchers with all components necessary
for an eventual impact on patient care."

Rupal Mehta, MD is an Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Division of Nephrology and Hypertension at the
Northwestern University (NU) Feinberg School of Medicine. Dr. Mehta has assembled a cross-disciplinary
mentorship team to advance her independent research program focused on studying heart failure (HF)
pathogenesis in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction
(HFpEF) is a common manifestation of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with CKD, and patients with
CKD represent a distinct and highly prevalent sub-phenotype within the heterogeneous syndrome of HFpEF.
Targeting of traditional mechanisms for CVD has not relieved the burden of HFpEF in CKD, suggesting that
CKD-specific mechanisms may exist. Given the kidney’s impact on small molecule clearance and metabolism,
Dr. Mehta proposes to investigate the central hypothesis that an altered metabolome in CKD contributes to
HFpEF pathogenesis. The scientific premise is based on the emergence of distinct metabolic signatures of
HFpEF, which suggests that CKD-induced metabolic changes may contribute to HFpEF pathogenesis. In Aim
1, Dr. Mehta will use the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study, a population-based epidemiologic study, to
investigate the associations between circulating metabolites and subclinical and clinical HFpEF in patients with
CKD. In a patient-oriented (POR) study in Aim 2, Dr. Mehta will examine the dose-response relationship
between circulating metabolites and subclinical HFpEF, phenotyped using 2D-speckle tracking
echocardiography and cardiopulmonary exercise testing, in patients with and without CKD. In an interventional
POR study in Aim 3, Dr. Mehta will use sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition as a therapeutic probe to
investigate whether modification of the metabolome in patients with CKD and subclinical HFpEF is associated
with improved cardiac structure and function over 6 months. The results will provide critical data to inform
future studies. Dr. Mehta’s career development goals are: 1) to expand knowledge of metabolomics testing and
interpretation of metabolomics data; 2) to strengthen skills in identifying HFpEF phenotypes and interpreting
cardiac testing in patients with CKD; 3) to develop expertise in conducting mechanistic POR studies; and 4) to
enrich research portfolio, master scientific management skills and build cross-disciplinary collaborations. Dr.
Mehta’s cross-disciplinary mentorship team includes experts in POR and CKD clinical trials (Primary mentor -
Dr. Tamara Isakova), cardiac phenotyping and HFpEF trials (Co-Mentor - Dr. Sanjiv Shah) and biostatistics
and metabolomics (Dr. Denise Scholtens). Two external advisory committee members will also provide
mentorship in metabolomics in HF (Dr. Ravi V Shah) and CKD (Dr. Morgan Grams). By completing the
proposed studies and attaining career development goals with guidance from experienced mentors and
support from the dynamic scientific environment at NU, Dr. Mehta will transition to research independence and
thrive as a physician-scientist committed to advancing the care of patients with CKD and HF."
10909032,"Cells lost to normal wear and tear in many adult tissues are replaced with the activity of stem cells. In response
to injury, however, cells can use entirely different strategies to repair and regenerate tissues. Injured tissues
can be regenerated through the activation of stem cells or from progenitor cells that, unlike stem cells, are
incapable of asymmetric division and self-renewal. The dramatic cellular changes that occur during
regeneration are thought to arise from altered signaling in the tissue microenvironment, or niche, but the
mechanisms regulating regeneration are largely unknown. A classical model of regeneration after injury is the
adult rat testis. In the testis, somatic cells create a microenvironment that contributes to the germ cell niche.
Critical somatic support cells include Leydig cells, the major androgen producing cells in males, which are
required for male health and fertility. Although Leydig cells are a quiescent cell type, and not thought to divide
under normal conditions, they are chemically ablated by ethane dimethane sulfonate (EDS). Several weeks
after chemical ablation, new Leydig cells repopulate the testis. The mechanism of Leydig cell regeneration and
the progenitors from which they arise remain poorly understood, partially due to the lack of genetic tools
available in rats. In vitro work has hinted at candidate markers that may identify progenitors of Leydig cell
regeneration. The goal of this project is to determine the cellular mechanism and molecular mechanism of
Leydig cell regeneration. Mouse genetics make it possible to interrogate the cellular mechanism of
regeneration by use of an inducible genetic lineage tracing system. In preliminary data, a subset of somatic
testis interstitial cells trace into new Leydig cells after ablation in mice. We will continue using this model to
determine the both identity of the progenitor cells and whether this cell type is self-renewing. We will also
determine the molecular mechanisms driving regeneration with the use of sc-RNA sequencing before, during,
and after regeneration. Candidate genes implicated in signaling and Leydig cell development that are
differentially expressed in regenerating cells will be tested for functional roles during regeneration using small
molecule pathway inhibitors and available genetic tools. While small molecules are an accessible way to gain
crude information about whether a signaling pathway is involved, sc-RNA sequencing will illuminate exactly
which cells produce signals that initiate the progenitor response. Determining the cellular and molecular
mechanisms of Leydig cell regeneration will significantly contribute to the understanding of adult tissue
regeneration in vivo with broader implications for male fertility and health."

Cancer is a common diagnosis in the emergency department (ED) and by the time patients reach the ED, their
cancer has often progressed to later stages. EDs are not intended to diagnose cancer. Training in cancer
management is limited for ED physicians, and patient access to follow-up care after a visit to the ED is often
difficult. Research from other western countries tells us that, compared to non-emergency settings, cancer
diagnosis through the ED is an independent predictor for worse outcomes, including poorer overall survival.
Very little is known about emergency diagnosis of cancer in the United States (U.S.). From a handful of studies
conducted in a few cancer types, we know that up to 30% of cancer patients are diagnosed as emergencies,
and low income and racial/ethnic minority patients are substantially more likely to be affected. However, across
different cancer types, the burden and risk factors of cancer diagnosis as an emergency have not been
studied. Furthermore, no population-based studies in the U.S. have compared survival differences in patients
with cancers diagnosed in EDs vs other non-emergent settings. And among those who are diagnosed as
emergencies, it is unclear why they visited the ED, rather than going to a primary care provider for their
diagnosis. Our long term goal is to establish the epidemiology of emergency cancer diagnosis in the U.S. We
will describe the burden of cancer diagnosis in the emergency department including the patient characteristics
of those most affected and quantify disparities across vulnerable populations defined by socioeconomic status,
race/ethnicity, and geographic isolation (Aim 1). We will estimate the relative importance of ED (compared to
non-ED) diagnosis on patient survival, after controlling for known risk factors like cancer stage, treatment,
patient age and chronic conditions (Aim 2). Finally, we will investigate modifiable drivers of disparities among
patients diagnosed as emergencies by examining their pre- and post-diagnostic patterns of care to identify
opportunities for prevention and improved outcomes (Aim 3). Our highly efficient study design uses
epidemiologic methods to analyze high-quality, population-based SEER-Medicare data for 1.8 million,
Americans who were diagnosed cancers of the esophagus, stomach, colon/rectum, liver, pancreas, lung,
breast, uterus, ovary, prostate, bladder, kidney, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, myeloma, and leukemia. The
investigative team includes experts in cancer epidemiology, healthcare delivery, cancer health disparities,
medical sociology, and oncology, family, and emergency medicine. This will be the first large-scale study of
emergency cancer diagnosis in the U.S. Establishing a base of evidence about this important problem,
including who is affected, where, and why, will illuminate a largely unrecognized issue, and identify modifiable
drivers of disparities in patients with the poorest prognoses."

Exquisite spatial and temporal control of the proteins that are expressed in a cell is essential for correct
differentiation and cell growth decisions. Despite being a central step in gene expression, how mRNA translation
is regulated remains poorly understood. There is a gap in our understanding of the molecular basis of specialized
translation of specific transcripts, and of the overall functional significance of this regulation on cellular responses
to signaling cues. Here we propose to investigate the contribution of mRNA translation regulation to the dynamic
gene expression programs that underlie cell physiology. The system we will focus on is the 13-subunit eIF3
translation initiation factor complex, which acts as a scaffold during general translation to organize interactions
between the small ribosomal proteins and other initiation factors. We recently discovered that eIF3 can also
control the translation of select cellular transcripts through novel RNA-binding and cap-binding activities. These
findings demonstrate that canonical translation initiation factors moonlight in roles outside of general translation
to drive expression of distinct gene programs. Despite these intriguing findings, and eIF3 being the largest
component of the translation machinery besides the ribosome, ascribing functions to the majority of subunits has
been challenging. Standard genetic techniques cannot be applied to eIF3; eIF3 subunits are essential for
viability, and the assembly of the multi-subunit eIF3 complex is hindered by alterations to subunit levels. These
methods also cannot segregate activities in general versus specialized translation. We will develop an innovative
set of high-throughput methodologies to address these difficulties and comprehensively discover how eIF3
controls the dynamic gene programs during cell differentiation and cellular response to extrinsic signals. By
combining these broad approaches with detailed biochemical and cell-based approaches, we will provide
molecular understanding of the translation regulation networks that coordinate the precise control required for
correct cellular function and signaling. This research will create new insights into fundamental principles of gene
regulation. As eIF3 and other initiation factors are genetically associated with cancer, aging, congenital disorders,
this work will also guide unconventional approaches to target translation regulation in disease."

Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), which promotes immune escape, is overexpressed in triple negative breast
cancer (TNBC), an aggressive subtype of breast cancer characterized by poor prognosis. Clinically approved
PD-L1 antibodies augment anti-tumor immunity by blocking extracellular PD-1/PD-L1 binding. However, the
contribution of intracellular PD-L1 to anti-tumor immunity and therapeutic resistance has remained poorly
understood. We have discovered a novel role for intracellular PD-L1 as an RNA binding protein that promotes
the stability of target RNAs. This new intracellular PD-L1 function in regulating RNA expression was independent
of the established extracellular role of PD-L1 as the ligand for PD-1. The activity of the anti-tumor immune
response is governed by a balance between immune effector cells and immune suppressor cells. Regulatory T
cells (Tregs) are a CD4+ T cell subpopulation that inhibit effector cell activity, suppress anti-tumor immunity and
promote therapeutic resistance. A hallmark of Tregs is the expression of the transcription factor, Foxp3, which
binds to the promoters of genes that support Treg activity. Foxp1 is a closely related family member of Foxp3.
Emerging data has demonstrated that Foxp1 cooperates with Foxp3 to encourage Foxp3-mediated transcription
and Treg function by maintaining Foxp3 occupancy at promoters of target genes. In our preliminary data, we
have identified Foxp1 as a key PD-L1 target RNA. We have found that the PD-L1 cytoplasmic domain, but not
the PD-L1 extracellular domain, interacts with Foxp1 RNA and promotes Foxp1 expression. In addition, we have
discovered that intracellular PD-L1’s promotion of Foxp1 expression is necessary for proper Treg differentiation,
Treg function, and TNBC progression. The Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway regulates
metabolic reprogramming for proper T cell maturation and function. Our preliminary data suggests that PD-L1
and Foxp1 are required for proper Akt-mTOR pathway activation and metabolism specifically in Tregs, but not
effector T cells, suggesting that targeting the PD-L1-Foxp1 pathway may preferentially inhibit Tregs to address
therapeutic resistance. Our overarching hypothesis is that intracellular PD-L1 stabilizes Foxp1 RNA to
promote Treg immunosuppressive activity and therapeutic resistance. Further, inhibiting intracellular
PD-L1 will promote anti-TNBC immunity by blocking Treg activity. This hypothesis will be tested in a series
of three aims: Aim 1 will determine the influence of intracellular PD-L1 on Foxp1 mRNA stability and Treg
differentiation; Aim 2 will determine the effect of intracellular PD-L1 on Treg function; Aim 3 will compare
intracellular PD-L1 and extracellular PD-L1/PD-1 directed TNBC therapy. Clear delineation of the impact of
intracellular PD-L1 on cancer therapy will provide important insight for optimizing combination strategies aimed
at overcoming immune escape and therapeutic resistance, laying the foundation for the design of the next
generation of TNBC clinical trials."

Esophageal cancer is the 6th leading cause of cancer death worldwide; rates of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) have
risen exponentially over the past 4 decades. When EAC is diagnosed at a late stage, 5‐year survival rates are dismal (∼18%).
Because of this, increased effort has focused on early detection and treatment of Barrett's esophagus (BE), the only
recognized precursor of EAC. Indeed, when esophageal neoplasia is diagnosed at an early stage (Barrett's with high grade
dysplasia/intramucosal cancer) and treated endoscopically, 5‐year survival rates exceed 98%. Early detection is currently
performed by standard upper endoscopy with high‐definition White Light (WL) and Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) which has
been shown to have a sensitivity of >90%. Nonetheless, standard endoscopy is invasive, expensive (commercial scopes
>$25,000) AND requires extensive infrastructure for patient exam/sedation.
Capsule endoscopy is an appealing alternative option for low‐resource regions (and community practices in the US) that
lack infrastructure and expert clinicians. Unfortunately, current commercially available capsule systems lack the spatial‐
resolution to accurately diagnose BE, are single‐use, and are costly (>$25,000 per system, >$350 per single‐use capsule).
The goal of this proposal is to develop a lower‐cost , high‐resolution capsule endoscopy system to allow less experienced
providers to screen for BE in community‐based settings in the US and low‐resource settings globally. The ScanCap system
has two components: a reusable, $75 tethered capsule that is swallowed to collect images of the mucosa and $1000
supporting system to manipulate and display the collected data on a tablet computer. After the capsule is swallowed, the
tether is withdrawn and high resolution, NBI images are collected from the entire esophagus. Unlike existing capsule
endoscopes, our design enables high resolution side‐viewing of the lumen, with circumferential scanning of the esophagus
through guided rotation of the mirror within the capsule as it is withdrawn. The system is portable, battery operated,
designed for use by non‐physicians in underserved settings, and can acquire high definition images with NBI to enable
visualization of capillary loops.
Here, we aim to (1) develop and refine a tethered capsule endoscope (ScanCap) with NBI for esophageal cancer screening,
(2) compare the image quality of ScanCap's NBI images to gold‐standard, high‐definition endoscopy with NBI using
resected ex vivo samples, (3) evaluate the functional & imaging capabilities and safety of the device in an IACUC‐approved
porcine study, and (4) test the imaging performance of ScanCap in a pilot study of 10 patients with documented BE in an
IRB‐approved human study.
Our multi‐disciplinary team will leverage advances in consumer grade image sensors, injection molded lenses, and optical
scanner technology to refine and evaluate a reusable capsule that rivals the performance of high‐definition, state‐of the
art NBI endoscopes AND is more cost‐effective (and higher‐resolution) than commercial swallowed capsule systems. The
end result will be a lower‐cost, reusable, high quality platform for esophageal cancer screening in community‐based
settings in the US and rural, underserved regions worldwide."

Resistance to therapy is the major challenge for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Despite recent successes
in immune checkpoint therapy of several human cancer types, pancreatic cancer showed a poor response to the
immunotherapy. Increasing evidence reveals that a dense stromal barrier in pancreatic cancer blocks drug
delivery and intratumoral distribution. The physical barrier of stromal and biological barrier from
immunosuppressive responses further limit the number and function of infiltrating effector T cells. The objective
of this project is to develop a new immunotherapy strategy by co-delivery of tumor penetrating and
immunomodulating theranostic nanoparticles and PD-L1 inhibitors. Our innovative uPAR targeted and stroma
breaking ligand consists of the amino terminal fragment (ATF) of uPA and the catalytic domain of matrix
metalloproteinase-14 (ATFmmp14). It targets multiple cell types in tumors and promotes nanoparticle/drugs
migrating through stromal and extracellular matrix barriers to reach tumor cells. ATFmmp14 conjugated magnetic
iron oxide nanoparticle (IONP) carrying Doxorubicin or SN38 enabled magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided
targeted delivery of nanoparticle/drug in tumors, and strong therapeutic effect in pancreatic cancer patient
derived xenograft (PDX) and Kras-driven transgenic mouse tumor models. Notably, targeted delivery of the
theranostic IONPs into tumors promoted infiltration of immune effector cells and decreased immunosuppressive
cells, converting an immune “cold” pancreatic tumor into a “hot” tumor. We further developed an ultrasmall IONP
PD-L1 inhibitor (Nano-iPD-L1) using an engineered PD-L1 blocking peptide. We showed that Nano-iPD-L1
selectively accumulated in pancreatic tumors following systemic delivery. Co-delivery of Nano-iPD-L1 with
ATFmmp14-IONP/drug enhanced intratumroal delivery and significantly inhibited tumor growth in a mouse
pancreatic cancer model. Therefore, we hypothesize that improved drug delivery in pancreatic tumors by co-
administrations of stroma penetrating ATFmmp14-IONP/SN38 and Nano-iPD-L1 leads to a strong therapeutic

IONP/SN38 and Nano-iPD-L1 on promoting infiltration of effector immune cells, modulating stromal
immunosuppressive cells and factors, and activating cytotoxic T cells will be investigated in transgenic mouse

Resistance to therapy is the major challenge for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Despite recent successes
in immune checkpoint therapy of several human cancer types, pancreatic cancer showed a poor response to the
immunotherapy. Increasing evidence reveals that a dense stromal barrier in pancreatic cancer blocks drug
delivery and intratumoral distribution. The physical barrier of stromal and biological barrier from
immunosuppressive responses further limit the number and function of infiltrating effector T cells. The objective
of this project is to develop a new immunotherapy strategy by co-delivery of tumor penetrating and
immunomodulating theranostic nanoparticles and PD-L1 inhibitors. Our innovative uPAR targeted and stroma
breaking ligand consists of the amino terminal fragment (ATF) of uPA and the catalytic domain of matrix
metalloproteinase-14 (ATFmmp14). It targets multiple cell types in tumors and promotes nanoparticle/drugs
migrating through stromal and extracellular matrix barriers to reach tumor cells. ATFmmp14 conjugated magnetic
iron oxide nanoparticle (IONP) carrying Doxorubicin or SN38 enabled magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided
targeted delivery of nanoparticle/drug in tumors, and strong therapeutic effect in pancreatic cancer patient
derived xenograft (PDX) and Kras-driven transgenic mouse tumor models. Notably, targeted delivery of the
theranostic IONPs into tumors promoted infiltration of immune effector cells and decreased immunosuppressive
cells, converting an immune “cold” pancreatic tumor into a “hot” tumor. We further developed an ultrasmall IONP
PD-L1 inhibitor (Nano-iPD-L1) using an engineered PD-L1 blocking peptide. We showed that Nano-iPD-L1
selectively accumulated in pancreatic tumors following systemic delivery. Co-delivery of Nano-iPD-L1 with
ATFmmp14-IONP/drug enhanced intratumroal delivery and significantly inhibited tumor growth in a mouse
pancreatic cancer model. Therefore, we hypothesize that improved drug delivery in pancreatic tumors by co-
administrations of stroma penetrating ATFmmp14-IONP/SN38 and Nano-iPD-L1 leads to a strong therapeutic
efficacy through direct tumor cell killing, modulating immunosuppressive stroma, and blocking PD-L1 function to
generate a strong response from cytotoxic T cells. In the proposed study, we will first investigate and optimize
dose and therapeutic efficacy of co-delivery of ATFmmp14-IONP/SN38 and Nano-iPD-L1 in mouse pancreatic
cancer models (Aim1). Followed by non-invasive MRI to assess theranostic IONP delivery and tumor response

The objective of this project is the development of a series of new organic methods through nontraditional
approaches for the activation of the π-bonds of alkynes and alkenes, along with their associated propargylic
and allylic positions. These methods greatly increase the versatility of these functional groups, providing
streamlined access to substructures and motifs that regularly occur in compounds of relevance to biomedical
research. In particular, in the first research area, we develop iron-based catalysts for the catalytic generation
of nucleophilic propargyl and allyl equivalents. The production of these catalytic intermediates will allow for the
formation of C–C and C–X bonds in a variety of synthetically useful and biomedically relevant contexts. In the
second research area, we develop methods that take advantage of a newly discovered series for reagents and
conditions for the generation of electron-deficient vinyl intermediates from alkynes. These reagents and
conditions enable the development of vinyl electrophile chemistry in complex, late-stage contexts for the
synthesis of heterocyclic derivatives and trisubstituted olefins in a stereodefined manner. These new methods
will allow for drug discovery and development efforts to take place in an accelerated manner to exert a positive
impact on public health."

We have repeatedly observed that cells acquire the ability to escape from viral replication/lysis upon long-term
low-level exposure to Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV). Whilst investigating the mechanisms associated with
escape, we showed that APOBEC3B is a major effector of mutational plasticity in cells which evade viral
replication/therapies including VSV. RNAseq of cells which escaped VSV identified ~300 coding mutations
with APOBEC3B signatures, some of which we hypothesized would directly affect the ability of the virus to
replicate within target cells. Of these mutations, a single C-T point mutation in the Cold Shock Domain
Containing E1 (CSDE1) gene (CSDE1C-T), which generates a mutant CSDE1 protein CSDE15P-S, was
expressed at high clonality in both human and murine cells, of different histological types, which became
resistant to VSV. These data show, for the first time to our knowledge, that CSDE1 plays a highly significant
role in replication of, and oncolysis by, VSV. We also observed that VSV can co-evolve to complement cellular
mutations such as CSDE1C-T. Thus, forced evolution of wild type VSV through CSDE15P-S cells allowed us to
track the emergence of a mutant virus VSV-IFNß-IGR P/MC-U. This virus contained a highly specific mutation
in the Intergenic region between the P and M genes of VSV (IGR P/MC-U) (located in the only perfect
consensus binding site for CSDE1 in the VSV genome) and completely rescued high level replication of virus
in cells expressing mutant CSDE15P-S. On the basis of these data, here we will test our overarching hypothesis
that CSDE1 is a critical mediator of the replication of VSV; that mutation in CSDE1, such as at CSDE1C-T,
allows for target cell escape from replication of VSV; and that VSV can evolve compensatory mutations to
recover replication fitness in CSDE1(C-T)-mutated cells. To test this hypothesis, we have formulated four
Specific Aims in which we will: (Aim 1) define how CSDE1 mediates replication of VSV, and how mutations in
CSDE1 are critically associated with escape from VSV; (Aim 2) understand how the IGR P/MC-U mutation in
VSV complements CSDE15P-S; (Aim 3) track the induction of the IGR P/MC-U mutation as the virus undergoes
strong selective pressures against its replication and identify the cellular anti-viral mutational pathways which
imprint mutational signatures onto VSV genomes; and (Aim 4) exploit our discovery of CSDE1 as a critical co-
factor for VSV replication to generate CSDE1-expressing VSV with enhanced efficacy as both vaccination and
oncolytic platforms. Overall, these studies will have significant impact in understanding VSV/host cell
interactions, in defining pathways by which viruses can usurp anti-viral mutagenic pathways to seed escape-
competent quasi species and will inform development of novel, improved VSV for vaccination and oncolysis."

We propose to identify novel radiomic signatures of anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PDL1)/PD1 therapy
response for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and evaluate how these signatures can augment established
biomarkers. Immunotherapy has been rapidly integrated into NSCLC management due to dramatically improved
response rates compared to conventional cytotoxic therapy and is now also accepted as 1st line therapy for
selected populations. While stratification of patients based on tumor expression of PDL1 has improved therapy
response rates, up to 30-40% of NSCLC patients still fail 1st line therapy with these agents, suggesting that new
strategies are needed to more accurately select patients likely to benefit. While a radiomic approach has yet to
be fully studied in the context of NSCLC immunotherapy, early evidence, including our preliminary data, suggests
that radiomic features extracted from routine computed tomography (CT) capture important characteristics of the
tumor phenotype, including vascular structure, intra-tumor heterogeneity, and immune infiltration of the tumor
microenvironment, which could provide a powerful phenotypic approach to augment established biomarkers for
anti-PDL1/PD1 therapy. We propose to perform the largest radiomics study conducted to date on immunotherapy
for NSCLC, leveraging CT data from an existing institutional database (n=2095 patients) which includes
biocorrelates of patients treated with anti-PD1/PDL1 therapy agents, and an on-going ECOG-ACRIN multi-
institutional trial (n=846) to be used for independent validation. By pursuing this research, we will therefore aim
to address this fundamental question: Can radiomic signatures augment established biomarkers, such as
PDL1 expression, in predicting which patients are likely to benefit most from anti-PD1/PDL1 therapy?
While most radiomics studies to date have focused on anti-PD1/PDL1 therapy for NSCLC in the non-1st line
setting, we will seek to discover radiomic signatures specifically for 1st versus later line of immunotherapy, and
we will examine such signatures both at baseline, prior to the initiation of therapy, as well as longitudinally during
the course of therapy in association to tumor response, progression-free and overall survival. We will further
correlate these signatures with known biomarkers of anti-PDL1 therapy response, including PDL1 expression,
tumor mutational burden (TMB), circulating (ct)-DNA, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILS), to better
understand how radiomics can augment these established and emerging biomarkers in predicting anti-
PD1/PDL1 therapy response. To discover these radiomic signatures, we will leverage the Cancer Phenomics
Toolkit (CapTK), an open-source and highly-standardized software developed by our group, and will utilize a
novel radiomic feature standardization approach, allowing us to incorporate CT scans acquired by variable
acquisition. Together, these approaches will result in robust phenotypic radiomic signatures that will enable a
more informed clinical management of patients selected for anti-PD1/PDL1 therapy by identifying more nearly
effective and earlier therapy options."

Leveraging the electronic health record to characterize and optimize care delivery for children 
with cerebral palsy: Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common physical disability of childhood, but it is highly 
heterogeneous with respect to its severity, response to therapy, care needs, and impact on wellness 
for the child and family. To optimize health and wellness throughout life and enable new research 
avenues to be effectively tested, it is critical to develop a comprehensive clinical care and 
biopsychosocial data model. Development of a comprehensive model would both accelerate and improve 
understanding, care, and further research, including the identification of novel targets for 
interventions. The overriding objective of this proposal is to develop a precision health model for CP-related phenotypes, health status, care activities, and psychosocial well-being that will individualize care. To accomplish this objective, we will automate the collection, cleaning, and integration of multi-dimensional, multi-domain and multi-cohort based ""big data"" extracted from the electronic health record (EHR), and combine this EHR data with prospectively 
collected, high-resolution clinical, functional, environmental and psychosocial data. The focus of this proposal will be on children between ages 6 and 12 years. Preliminary work indicates that the medical center provides care for 
approximately 1,800 patients with CP who are between the ages of 6 and 12 years and have at least 
three years of EHR data. From this EHR cohort, we will prospectively recruit 200 children and their 
families for detailed phenotyping.
Recruitment will be stratified by Gross Motor Functional Classification System (GMFCS) Levels: 60% 
GMFCS I, II, or III (able to walk) and 40% GMFCS IV or V (use a wheelchair). Using this 
multi-cohort design will allow for robust characterization of multi-dimensional factors that impact care receipt, functional 
outcomes, quality of life and participation. Aim 1 will focus on creating a diverse and comprehensive data repository 
using both retrospective and prospective data to characterize actual versus optimal care (defined 
by current evidence-based literature). Aim 2 will lead to development of a receipt of care 
coefficient score and characterize how the degree of optimal care relates to function, quality of 
life and participation, controlling for functional status and age. [Models developed in Aim 2 will 
be translated into a clinical decision tool prototype. Aim 3 will demonstrate proof of concept for 
scalability of machine learning algorithms with the PEDSnet Learning Health System. This project 
innovatively combines retrospective EHR data with prospective clinical data to elucidate 
individual, treatment, family, and environmental factors associated with greater receipt of 
evidence-based care and/or better outcomes. This project will move the field toward precision 
medicine for CP and create a foundation for development of clinical dashboards to optimize practice.]"

The epidermal growth factor (EGFR) oncogene is amplified and drives tumor growth in 55% of adult
glioblastomas (GBMs). However, EGFR inhibitors have failed to demonstrate clinical benefit in GBM, presenting
one of the most fundamental challenges facing the field of neuro-oncology. As highlighted by the National Cancer
Institute’s recent think tank on progress in GBM, despite clear signals about the genomic underpinnings of GBM,
including the high frequency of EGFR amplification, new drug development programs have stalled because of
the high risk of clinical failures. Intra-tumoral genetic heterogeneity, and the poor brain-plasma ratios of many
drug candidates, are thought to play a major role in clinical failure. Building on the team’s recent discoveries
demonstrating that EGFR is amplified almost exclusively on extrachromosomal DNA particles (ecDNA), driving
intra-tumoral genetic heterogeneity, accelerated tumor evolution, and EGFR inhibitor resistance, and their
discovery of actionable metabolic dependencies that arise when EGFR becomes amplified, this proposal will
identify proteins on which EGFR-amplified GBMs selectively depend for survival, even in highly heterogeneous
tumors. This proposal integrates a hypothesis-driven approach with unbiased discovery using activity-based
protein profiling (ABPP). In clinically relevant patient-derived models of GBM, this proposal takes a chemistry-
first approach to discover both actionable dependencies that arise when EGFR is amplified and ligands that
engage these proteins, which can be made to be highly brain-penetrant. By deploying fully functionalized (FF)
small-molecule libraries to enable direct progression from phenotypic screening to target identification in living
GBM cells, including in patient-derived GBMs with amplified EGFR, this proposal is poised to inform actionable
therapeutic targets for patients in vivo. The proposed integrated approach provides a rapid route towards
initiating new drug development that directly addresses the fundamental challenges of GBM."

10873834,"Chorioamnionitis complicates up to 70% of preterm births, and is characterized by acute inflammation of the
placental/fetal unit, exposing the fetus to significant inflammation. These infants have an increased risk of
short- and long-term morbidities involving multiple organ systems including the intestine. However,
mechanisms by which fetal exposure to maternal inflammation (FEMI) leads to adverse outcomes remain
unclear. Our preliminary and published data show that an interleukin-6 (IL-6)-dependent loss of Paneth cells
contributes to FEMI-associated susceptibility to bowel injury. Our data suggest that FEMI leads to: IL-6-
dependent Paneth cell loss; lingering elevation of serum baseline levels of inflammatory cytokines, including
IL-6; clinically relevant intestinal injury; and increased susceptibility to secondary intestinal injury. However,
specific mechanisms underlying these effects including the source of IL-6, the site of IL-6-induced pathogenic
action, specific signal pathways by which Paneth cells are impacted, and subsequent consequences of Paneth
cell perturbation remain incompletely understood. Addressing this gap in knowledge is critical for restoring IL-6
modulation, a potential interventional opportunity for preventing FEMI-induced pathology. The objective of this
proposal is to delineate key mechanisms by which FEMI decreases Paneth cells and increases susceptibility to
intestinal injury in the offspring. Our central hypothesis is that fetal exposure to IL-6 from maternal or placental
(or both) sources is a key mechanism by which FEMI alters signal transducers and activators of transcription-1
signaling in the offspring, leading to increased interferon lambda signal pathways, reduced Paneth cell density,
and increased injury susceptibility. The rationale for undertaking this project is to gain a mechanistic advance
in knowledge of how FEMI leads to neonatal morbidity and mortality. Such knowledge will be critical to develop
novel preventative strategies, to prevent complications and mortality of prematurity, and to directly improve the
quality of life of pre-term infants. Our hypothesis will be tested through two aims: 1) Identify the site(s) of
pathologic action of IL-6 and downstream signaling pathways activated following FEMI, and 2) Determine the
effects of FEMI on pathways critical to Paneth cell homeostasis. The proposed research is significant and
innovative as our proposed studies will directly address the gap in knowledge regarding increased neonatal
morbidity and mortality following FEMI and specifically the impact on Paneth cells using novel in vivo, in vitro,
and ex vivo approaches to investigate the role of FEMI-induced IL-6 on fetal outcomes. This knowledge will
lead to development of targeted therapies to improve intestinal health."

The objective of the proposed project is to increase the transfer of Native American students from
accredited 2-year degree-granting institutions to baccalaureate degree programs in biomedical and
behavioral sciences with the ultimate goal to aid these students in attaining their baccalaureate degrees.
The program resides at Northern Arizona University (NAU) and partners with Coconino Community
College (CCC); both institutions are located in Flagstaff, AZ. In 2008, NAU and CCC began a transfer
program called CCC2NAU, which creates a seamless transition for students at CCC to NAU by
matriculating in both institutions with shared resources for the students. NAU’s geographic location is
ideal for enhancing the academic experiences of Native American students since Flagstaff is considered
a border town for the Navajo and Hopi Nations and is near the White River Apache and Hualapai
Nations. With allegiance to Native American student excellence by NAU and CCC and an exemplary
geographic location to several tribal lands, the Bridging Arizona Native American Students to Bachelor
Degrees program provides a pathway for Native American students to pursue biomedical and behavioral
science careers. The proposed T34 program will administer academic year training and professional
development in writing, communication, and enhancement of reproducibility along with hands-on
research experiences. Additionally, the program will focus on student advising and mentorship and will
connect Native American science role models with the burgeoning student researchers. The program is
centered on a 24-month experience for Native American students who will be recruited in their first year
at CCC. The structure of the program will provide support to three Bridges scholars during their
sophomore year at CCC, and three Bridges scholars who have transferred to NAU during their junior
year. In addition to recruiting through CCC programs, the proposed program will network with regional
high schools with high Native American student enrollment to recruit motivated students. The program
will counsel Bridges scholars at NAU during their junior year to identify and apply for financial support in
their senior year to enable biomedical or behavioral science degree completion while exploring graduate
training opportunities. As an eight-year R25 grant, we trained more than 54 Native American students
and successfully transitioned 46% of these students to 4-year baccalaureate programs. Our goal in this
T34 application is to improve the percentage to 70% transfer rates of Bridges participants. We believe
with 24 months of strategic support and the reconfiguration of the program, this goal is achievable.
Programmatic modifications for the T34 application were guided by the evaluation of the R25 program."

Background: Structural racism, defined as all the ways in which society cultivates racial discrimination through
reinforcing inequitable systems of education, healthcare, and employment, is manifested in macroaggressions,
which are contained within the policies and practices within institutions serving the biomedical sciences. These
macroaggressions foster and perpetuate discriminatory beliefs and practices that impair not only scientific
productivity and new discoveries in biomedical research but also the career trajectories of those from ethnic
minoritized groups and communities. Specifically, macroaggressions necessitate that individuals, especially
those in positions of power and leadership change their prejudices and actions. Thus, interventions for
macroaggressions and structural racism must recognize and address racial and ethnic prejudices and
discrimination that arise on an individual level, known as, racial microaggressions. The harm of racial
microaggressions is compounded when intersectional (relating to other marginalized backgrounds such as
gender, nativity status etc.) and thus creates overlapping systems of oppression. In order to create a culture
conducive to change within a range of biomedical research environments, trainees and their supervisors need
to better understand and acknowledge their own backgrounds and how their perspectives have been shaped
based upon a combination of their lived experiences interacting with a culture steeped in a history of structural
racism. In order to facilitate institutional-level change in policies and procedures that disproportionately impact
those from minoritized backgrounds, it is important that institutional leaders also be active change agents.
Purpose: The primary objective of the proposal is to create a series of self-directed, self-paced learning
modules that biomedical research trainees, supervisors, and organizational leaders can use to better
understand ways that structural racism influences their own biases and behaviors as well as strategies to use
when they are a target, bystander, or perpetrator of racial and intersectional microaggressions, and to use
these strategies in addressing institutional level policies indicative of racial and intersectional
macroaggressions. Additional objectives include collecting qualitative and quantitative data to evaluate the
feasibility, acceptability, accessibility, and initial impact of the new modules on a range of participants.
Methods and Design: A community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach will be used to ensure that
the new educational modules are based upon empirical science, are theoretically-grounded, and include
iterative feedback from a range of key stakeholder groups (e.g., biomedical trainees, supervisors, and leaders).
A preliminary evaluation including random assignment of participants to intervention and comparator conditions
will be used to determine whether the educational modules are associated with increases in knowledge and
self-efficacy in appropriately handling racial and intersectional macroaggressions and microaggressions."

Mechanisms of B cell responses to particulate antigens
Two biophysical attributes shared by most animal viruses are the display of viral-specific proteins at certain
densities on the surface of individual virions and the encapsulation of viral genome inside the virion. A threshold
density of viral surface proteins is important to ensure efficient viral infection of host cells. From the perspective
of the host, a threshold density of viral surface proteins may also be critical for the recognition by germline B
cells for efficient mounting of humoral responses. The encapsulated genetic material may also stimulate B cells
through the Toll-like receptors. Substantial mechanistic studies at the single-molecule level and imaging of live
cells have revealed the sensitivity of B cells to the density of antigens. However, at the mechanistic level, it
remains largely uncharacterized how B cells may recognize and respond to the individual as well as collective
attributes of a virus, including the spatial density of proteins and the internal nucleic acids. This project aims to
unravel the cellular and molecular mechanisms of B cell responses to viral features both in vivo and in vitro,
using a new generation of model particulate antigens that we have recently developed. The success of this
project will yield new and important mechanistic information on how B cells recognize particulate antigens similar
to viruses, and reveal the functional outcomes of B cells in response to the recognition of the biophysical features
of these antigens."

Dendritic cells (DCs) play a fundamental role in bridging innate and adaptive immunity. Among DC subtypes,
conventional DC2 (cDC2) are pivotal in multiple diseases including allergy, fungal & parasite infection, and
cancer. However, studying cDC2 has been challenged by the small cell number and a lack of the subset-
specific animal model. To better understand the characteristics and roles of cDC2 subsets, we have utilized the
cutting-edge, RNA-based high-throughput transcriptomic profiling technique known as single cell RNA-
sequencing (scRNA-seq). This approach has enabled us to better understand lung cDC2 in terms of diversity
and cellular hierarchy.
Our preliminary data indicate that lung cDC2 can be categorized into 6 distinct subsets. Of interest, lung
CX3CR1hicDC2 subset are origin of rest of 5 subsets. In aim 1, we will test whether other lung cDC2 subsets
are derived from the CX3CR1hicDC2 subset. In aim 2, we will test whether a cDC-specific CX3CR1 depletable

Successful completion of this project will provide us with a better understanding of heterogeneity and cellular
dynamic lineage trajectory of lung cDC2. Moreover, our new mouse strain, cDC specific CX3CR1 depletable
strain (CX3CR1-DTRcDC), will be a great asset to study cDC2-mediated diseases."

Tuberculosis (TB), caused by infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, remains a major cause of human

The over-arching goal of our long-standing P01 Project has been to identify the principles of innate immune

preventing infections in humans. This P01 project represents a shift from tackling basic mechanisms towards
this goal by applying the collaborative insights of our group to tackle the uniquely challenging problem of
vaccine development for TB. TB research is inherently difficult as it requires dedicated facilities and

biosafety level 3 pathogen. Furthermore, success of the P01 requires integrated and collaborative mouse-
based infection and vaccination studies which will require a high degree of standardization and oversight in

This proposal is Project 1 within a P01 renewal, entitled “The intersection of innate and adaptive immunity to
intracellular pathogens.” A central problem that we address is how intracellular pathogens are recognized
by the host innate immune system and how multiple signals are integrated to induce an appropriate
response, and conversely, how pathogens avoid and/or manipulate host responses to promote their
pathogenesis. In Project 1, we have chosen to approach this problem by continuing a detailed analysis of
Listeria monocytogenes, a facultative intracellular, food-borne pathogen that has been studied for decades
as a model system with which to dissect basic aspects of infection & immunity. Previously, we discovered
that L. monocytogenes secretes c-di-AMP which binds to and activates host STING leading to a type I
interferon response. In Aim 1, we exploit a newly developed oral model of listeriosis where we find that
bacterially secreted c-di-AMP induces a STING-dependent host protective response. We propose to
analyze how STING provides protection and test the hypothesis that STING also promotes dissemination to
the placenta and brain. In Aims 2 and 3, we begin to explore the idea that c-di-AMP might be just one
example of the principle that small bacterial metabolites play important roles in shaping host immunity. L.
monocytogenes is a riboflavin requiring microorganism, and we explore the hypothesis that that this
nutritional requirement allows the bacteria to avoid activation of mucosal-associated invariant T-cells (MAIT
cells), which are innate T-cells stimulated by a modified intermediate of riboflavin biosynthesis. In
preliminary data, we introduced five Bacillus subtilis genes (ribDEAHT) into L. monocytogenes converting it
into a riboflavin-synthesizing bacterium and are now poised to test our hypothesis and learn about the role
of MAIT cells during bacterial infection and immunity. We also propose to explore the activation of the
dominant gamma delta T-cell in humans (Vg9Vd2 T-cells). These cells are activated by an intermediate of
bacterial isoprenoid biosynthesis (HMBPP). Our ultimate goal is to determine the importance of this innate
immune pathway during infection of primates (human and non-human). Here we propose to construct
bacterial mutants that either fail to make HMBPP or make more of it to examine how bacterial HMBPP is
detected during infection in tissue culture models. We further propose to collaborate with the Cox lab
(Project 2) to explore the importance of HMBPP during M. tuberculosis infection and immunity."

Tuberculosis (TB), caused by infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, remains a major cause of human
morbidity and mortality, particularly in the developing world. The spread of antibiotic resistant strains of M.
tuberculosis has increased the urgency to develop new vaccines with greater efficacy than Bacille Calmette-
Guerin (BCG), which is ineffective to prevent pulmonary infection in adults, by far the most common form of
TB. The ESX-1 secretion system of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a key virulence determinant that is required
for intracellular growth and for eliciting distinct innate immune responses, autophagy and type I interferon (IFN)
during infection. BCG is extremely similar to M. tuberculosis but it lacks ESX-1 and thus cannot trigger these
powerful innate immune pathways. The overarching goal of this project is to identify the M. tuberculosis factors
that specifically activate these responses, and use this to create BCG strains that engage these pathways
during vaccination. In Aim 1, we investigate ESX-1 secreted substrates that are required for perforating
phagosomal membranes in collaboration with Project 1, and use a new system to express these factors in
BCG to restore perforation but without the rest of the ESX-1 secretion system. In Aim 2, we explore two
hypotheses for how M. tuberculosis limits targeting to autophagy, a powerful anti-bacterial host defense
mechanism. In Aim 3, we will utilize our existing knowledge, as well as information from Aims 1 and 2, to
engineer BCG strains to specifically test the role of autophagy and type I IFN in promoting immunity. Moreover,
we will collaborate with Projects 1, 3, 4, and Core B, to compare and combine our recombinant BCG strategy
with STING-targeted adjuvants (Project 4) and bacterial metabolites (Project 1) to identify synergies between
these approaches, and to test their efficacy in novel models of vaccination (Projects 3 and 4). Thus, these
studies will not only provide deeper mechanistic understanding of how autophagy and anti-viral signaling are
activated, but may lead directly to the creation of new TB vaccines."

research independence as a clinician scientist in basic and translational neuroscience, with specialization in cell
type-specific mechanisms that regulate neuronal autophagy and modify proteotoxicity in Parkinson disease (PD).
Applicant: The applicant has completed M.D. and Ph.D. degrees, residency training in neurology, and fellowship
training in PD and movement disorders. He has previous experience in neuroscience research using cell and
mouse models to study autophagy in spinobulbar muscular atrophy. His career development plan is designed to
focus his research on PD pathogenesis and advance his knowledge in bioinformatics, CRISPR gene editing and
high-throughput screening, and advanced imaging techniques. In so doing, the training plan outlined herein
builds upon his prior training to achieve research independence. He will benefit from continual mentor
engagement, regular meetings and ongoing collaborations. He will learn additional research techniques through
formal coursework, workshops, and national meetings. These training mechanisms will provide the applicant
with the scientific and conceptual skillset necessary for an independent career in neurodegenerative research.
Research Plan: PD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by motor and non-motor/multi-systemic
symptoms that lead to profound disability. There is no effective disease-modifying therapy currently available.
Neurodegeneration in PD relates to toxic aggregation of ⍺-synuclein, and mounting evidence shows that ⍺-
synuclein can be degraded through the conserved pathway of autophagy. However, current methods to modulate
autophagy fail to confer neuroprotective effects in patients. In recently published work, the applicant identified
MTMR5 (myotubularin-related phosphatase 5, encoded by the SBF1 transcript) as a potent neuronal autophagy
suppressor in neurons. MTMR5 knockdown enhances the sensitivity of neurons to induction of autophagy, and
accelerates the degradation of multiple autophagy substrates, including disease-associated and aggregate-
prone proteins. In line with this, this proposal will test the central hypothesis that reducing MTMR5 in neurons
augments autophagic clearance of ⍺-synuclein and reduces ⍺-synuclein-related neuronal death. The applicant
will use human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to determine if manipulating SBF1/MTMR5 enhances ⍺-
synuclein turnover via autophagy (Aim 1) and modifies ⍺-synuclein proteotoxicity (Aim 2). He will also employ
unbiased, genome-wide CRISPR-based screens to uncover key factors regulating MTMR5 in neurons (Aim 3).
Collectively, these studies establish a novel research platform focusing on neuronal autophagy, myotubularin
biology, and therapy design in PD and related neurodegenerative disorders."

Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a unique and powerful clinical imaging modality that can detect
molecular and functional information from the human body. However, the current scintillation-based detection
mechanism poses constraints in reducing the coincidence time resolution (CTR), which indicates how accurately
we can measure the point that positron was emitted from in the body, thus the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). A
novel detection mechanism is proposed to significantly reduce CTR, down to 10-picosecond (ps), by directly
detecting the ionization charges, which occur before scintillation photon emission. With the 10-ps CTR, several
clinical advantages are expected, including real-time imaging with a much lower patient dose. To achieve less
than 10-ps CTR in PET, Dr. Jeong will use the advanced ultrafast optics technique of spectral encoding which
uses colors of light to measure the arrival timing of the annihilation photons created from the position. Previously,
a proof-of-concept experiment and simulation using the spectra encoding was performed at the SLAC national
accelerator laboratory. For this project, the same technique will be tailored to the annihilation photons, which
have higher energy and lower particle numbers, as described in Aim 1. Establish a sensitive free-space optical
setup that achieves < 10ps CTR, where spectral information acquired from the ultrafast laser probes will be
compared for the coincidence arrival timings of the annihilation photons. In Aim 2, in parallel, fiber-based
detection modules will be developed for stronger spatial overlap of the probe laser beam and the ionization track,
further enabling efficient beam delivery and high-packing fraction. In Aim 3, with the detector modules developed
in Aims 1 and 2, Dr. Jeong will demonstrate the dynamic imaging performance of the 10-ps CTR PET modules
toward functional brain imaging. Dr. Jeong will first perform simulations using the CTR values in the 10-ps range
to obtain expected image quality then collect dynamic data from radioactive sources with fixed positions between
the two modules, with milliseconds frames, relevant to human brain activity timescales. The SNR from the <10-
ps CTR detectors will be ~5 times greater than the SNR of data taken with the same time frames from two
detectors with 230-ps CTR. The proposed project is highly interdisciplinary, requiring forefront expertise in
medical imaging, ultrafast optics, fast data acquisition, and image reconstruction for PET. Through this project,
Dr. Jeong will be further trained in the areas of ultrafast optics and medical imaging, expanding from the previous
training experience to become an independent investigator. Experts in the above research areas will advise and
help Dr. Jeong to obtain new skill sets at Stanford, with excellent institutional support. Through this K99/R00
training plan which includes auditing classes, grant writing, career development, and student mentoring, Dr.
Jeong will be able to obtain critical skills to flourish as an independent investigator."
10922714,"Project Summary / Abstract
Upcoming brain-wide descriptions of synaptic connectivity are poised to transform our understanding of brain
circuitry in the same way single-cell genomics has revolutionized our understanding of cell type diversity. The
challenge of relating whole-brain wiring diagrams to cell-type genetic properties must be overcome in order to
fully realize the potential of these datasets. Very few techniques generate multi-modality, ""Rosetta stone""
datasets needed to link cell types to connectivity, and none presently have the throughput to do so across an
entire mammalian brain. In this proposal, we address key limitations that currently prevent such techniques from
scaling to meet the throughput of whole-mouse-brain connectivity initiatives, and develop the computational
frameworks needed to bind cell types to wiring diagrams.
The Patch-seq method links the full gene expression profile of single neurons with their fundamental properties,
including local morphology and electrophysiology1,2. In Aim 1, we will automate the Patch-seq technique to allow
parallelization and scaling sufficient for whole mouse brain coverage. This will be achieved by integrating and
optimizing recently developed methods for patch clamp automation, including pipette cleaning, cell detection,
and machine learning approaches to cell identification and tracking. Developments will be fully documented and
packaged for dissemination to lower barriers to access and further improve throughput via collaborative data
generation.
Similarly, methods for reconstructing the brain-wide full morphology of single neurons provides simultaneous
access to their local morphology and long-range projection targets. In Aim 2, we will improve and extend the
quality, efficiency, and capability of our automatic morphological reconstruction pipeline by adopting new
approaches to reconstruction (e.g., a hierarchy of deep learners), and testing advanced methods for tissue
processing and imaging across our Patch-seq and Full Morphology data generation pipelines. Automated
reconstruction methods will be trained and tested on gold standard data. Tools and data will be collaboratively
generated and publicly shared.
In Aim 3, we will develop new computational frameworks to link whole-brain connectivity datasets to multi-
modality cell type datasets. Powered by the throughput achieved in Aims 1 and 2, we will develop, apply, and
share machine learning-based data analysis methods to synthesize the observations collected from individual
platforms to achieve an integrated and predictive understanding of neuronal identity. This approach, which
facilitates cell type assignment, cross-modality integration and inference, and characterization of the
discreteness and continuity of fundamental cellular properties within and across types, will be scaled to achieve
whole mouse brain coverage."
10931366,"In this proposal, we will determine if we can use microglial extracellular vesicles (EV) that have been shed into
the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and serum to predict the microglial activation state in the Parkinson’s brain (PD).
Currently, a major obstacle in the field is that there are no established and validated methods to detect brain
inflammation in response to neurodegeneration during life. Microglia, the resident immune cell of the CNS
constantly patrol the brain, looking for signs of infection or inflammation caused by a host of immune stimulants.
The role of microglia is to clear potential threats to the CNS, but their chemical signatures based on their
presence are continuously released (cytokines). These cytokines activate neighboring microglia initiating a
cascade of events that are believed to drive disease pathogenesis. Although cytokines are generally considered
to function as soluble molecules, recent efforts have shown that cytokines are encapsulated in EVs. These EVs
contain a host of inflammatory-associated mRNAs that encode cytokine-associated genes among other signaling
molecules that are known to reflect the physiological state of the parent cell. Unlike microglia, EVs can cross
the blood-brain barrier under leaky and inflamed conditions, both of which are known physiological processes in
PD. To determine if we can identify microglial EVs in the periphery we will characterize EVs isolated from
disease-associated microglia (DAM) using RNAseq and Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS).
This novel data will be used to generate targets for discovery work in the periphery. This proposal aims to address
two unmet needs 1) the possibility to detect brain inflammation in the living and 2) the ability to distinguish EVs
released from microglia from those released from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We hypothesize that
microglial EVs extracted from the serum/CSF will reflect EV profiles from DAM. To test our hypothesis, we
propose to 1) Analyze membrane-bound proteins and EV cargo in disease-associated microglia (DAM), 2)
analyze membrane-bound proteins and EV cargo in peripheral EVs isolated from PD peripheral blood
mononuclear cells, 3) identify and validate unique microglial-specific EV membrane antigens for antibody
discovery work and 4) use these validated antibodies to pull down microglial-specific EVs from CSF and serum.
All the tissues proposed in the application were collected from premortem PD patients who have since passed
and have pathological confirmation of disease without comorbidities. We believe that each of these individual
aims is high impact, and novel on their own, but collectively could provide us the tools necessary to predict brain
inflammation."
10842367,"Project Summary
Men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) are at increased risk of anal cancer
because of prevalent anal human papillomavirus (HPV) infections. Anal cancer incidence among MSM ranges
from 37 to 131 cases per 100,000. That is roughly 20 to 80 times higher than anal cancer rates in the general
population. TGW have similar if not greater risk of precancerous anal lesions than MSM. HPV vaccination
provides a unique opportunity to decrease anal cancer disparities for MSM and TGW; however, current HPV
vaccine coverage is inadequate. Targeted efforts are urgently needed to increase HPV vaccine uptake among
eligible adult MSM and TGW. We propose that leveraging existing HIV prevention services already utilized by
MSM and TGW (e.g., pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP]) can help to increase the reach and equity of HPV
vaccination. MSM/TGW on PrEP have increased need for HPV vaccination given high rates of anal cancer risk
factors. However, HPV vaccination is not part of current screening guidelines for PrEP initiation. The long-term
objective of this research is to develop a multilevel PrEP clinic-based toolkit to support shared clinical decision
making for anal cancer prevention. The objective of this application is to develop patient-level anal cancer
prevention content targeted to ethnoracially diverse MSM/TGW PrEP patients. This is a mixed methods health
communication approach that engages PrEP patients and providers. We will use perceptual mapping and
vector message modeling to create culturally responsive anal cancer prevention messaging focused on HPV
vaccination. The methods are informed by the information-motivation-behavioral skills model, guided by an
intersectionality framework, and applies best practices in health communication. There are three specific aims:
(1) Determine anal cancer prevention information needs and messaging strategies for MSM/TGW on PrEP; (2)
Develop targeted anal cancer prevention messages for MSM/TGW on PrEP; and (3) Assess the acceptability,
relevance, and comprehensibility of anal cancer prevention messages and identify implementation strategies.
In-depth qualitative interviews and focus groups with MSM/TGW on PrEP and PrEP providers will provide
qualitative evidence (aims 1 and 3). Perceptual mapping surveys and vector message modeling (aim 2) will be
used to develop content for the anal cancer prevention toolkit. This project will help reduce cancer disparities
by improving medical decision making and patient-provider communication regarding anal cancer prevention.
The multi-level approach addresses gaps as outlined in the National Institute on Minority Health and Health
Disparities Research Framework. We focus on behavioral and healthcare system domains at individual and
interpersonal levels. The content developed in this study will be included in a multilevel PrEP clinic-based
toolkit, providing patient education, provider messaging, and implementation strategies. The effectiveness of
the toolkit on HPV vaccine uptake and decisional quality outcomes will be tested in a future R01."
10827492,"Excessive sedentary behavior is highly prevalent in developed nations and is a risk factor for cardiovascular
disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality. Evidence suggests sedentary behavior is not simply a form of inactivity
that elicits positive energy balance. Instead sedentary behavior itself may be harmful. As such, health agencies
have provided general recommendations to “sit less, move more” by interspersing brief periods of activity.
However, a lack of empirical evidence describing how often (e.g. every 30 min, every 60 min) and for how long
(e.g. 1 min activity bouts, 5 min activity bouts) sedentary time should be interrupted (a “sedentary break”) to
yield health benefit has precluded more quantitative, actionable guidelines. To date, rigorous and methodical
dose escalation experiments have not been conducted to elucidate efficacious and tolerated sedentary break
doses. Without specific targets to provide to the public; public health initiatives targeting sedentary behavior will
likely have minimal effectiveness. Critically, without rigorously tested dosing information; randomized controlled
trials targeting sedentary behavior may be fruitless; bearing risk of inefficacious or intolerable doses. The
objective of the proposed study is to determine the minimally effective dose (e.g. the smallest dose) for two
elements of a sedentary break, frequency and duration, that yields improvements in established CVD risk
factors. We will also determine the maximally tolerated dose (e.g. the highest dose that does not cause undue
physical/psychological distress) for both frequency and duration of sedentary breaks. To address our aims, we
will conduct a state-of-the-art dose finding study under well controlled laboratory conditions using an innovative
Bayesian adaptive randomization method for dose determination never before applied to behavioral trials. This
method will enable us to efficiently test 25 possible frequency/duration combinations in just a single study. We
will recruit 324 adults to complete a total of 2 trial conditions in the laboratory (8 hours each), namely a
sedentary break (active) condition and an uninterrupted sitting (control) condition, in a randomized order. The
sedentary break condition will consist of 1 of 25 possible frequency/duration combinations (e.g. every 30 min
for 10 min), selected according to the adaptive randomization protocol. Established CVD risk factors, including
blood pressure and glucose, as well as measures of dose tolerability (physical exhaustion/fatigue, affect) and
work engagement and performance will be serially assessed during each trial. We view this project as a
groundbreaking step towards developing evidence-based guidelines for sedentary behavior that will establish a
foundation upon which a successful sedentary behavior intervention development process can be rooted. By
identifying the minimally effective and maximally tolerated dose combinations for the frequency and duration of
a sedentary break; this study will provide key foundational evidence critical to the success of future Phase III
and Phase IV randomized trials and ultimately public health guidelines."
10877067,"Modern lifestyles have led to short sleep and misalignment of behaviors to the endogenous circadian clock,
which is governed by the light-dark cycle. The resulting deleterious effects on sleep quality and circadian rhythms
have been associated with a plethora of chronic diseases that afflict a large portion of the population. Specifically,
short sleep duration, poor quality sleep/sleep disorders, and circadian misalignment have been associated with
an increased risk of obesity and cardiovascular disease. However, the causality of these associations and their
underlying mechanisms have yet to be fully uncovered. In attempting to uncover the causal impact of insufficient
sleep on obesity, our lab has shown that acute sleep restriction upregulates neuronal reward networks implicated
in hedonic food consumption and results in higher intake of energy, particularly from fat, relative to adequate
sleep. Others have also shown that these sleep manipulations drive late-night eating, which may then cause
circadian misalignment. However, acute sleep restriction (<4 h of sleep/night for 5 nights) is not a typical behavior
and we are now testing the impact of longer, milder forms of sleep restriction as well as prolonged circadian
misalignment, on energy balance and cardiovascular disease risk. The main objective of this proposed research
program is to elucidate the pathways by which sleep patterns and alignment of lifestyle behaviors, namely food
consumption, activity, and sleep, to one another influence obesity and cardiovascular disease risk. We propose
mechanistic clinical intervention studies in men and women that manipulate sleep and circadian rhythms as
exposures on cardiometabolic risk factors. These randomized controlled interventions will include outcomes such
as energy balance (measurements of food intake, energy expenditure, and body composition) and
cardiovascular disease risk factors (cellular and systemic inflammation, immune function, glucose regulation,
blood pressure). Men and women will be enrolled in equal numbers to assess whether the pathways that related
poor sleep and circadian misalignment to cardiometabolic risk differ by sex. We plan to use the research flexibility
afforded by this grant mechanism to expand collaborations with investigators in related and complementary fields
of research, resulting in sharing of techniques and research paradigms between laboratories, train fellows and
future investigators in the fields of sleep, circadian rhythms, and cardiometabolic health, and promote awareness
of the importance of sleep and alignment of lifestyle behaviors to circadian clocks for optimal health."
10864067,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
U.S. institutions of higher education have not been as successful as desired at attracting, enrolling, and
graduating underrepresented (UR) or disadvantaged students who later pursue research and health professional
careers. The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) has a number of faculty who engage in
research that fulfills the NHLBI mission, with more than $20 million in total research funding from NIH and $5
million in research funding from other agencies. Thus, UAMS is well positioned to help address shortfalls in the
diversity of researchers in cardiovascular, pulmonary, or hematologic areas by providing an active pool of
potential research mentors for UR and disadvantaged undergraduate students. The UAMS Summer
Undergraduate Research Program (SURP) to Increase Diversity in Research was implemented in 2012 to
increase the diversity of students entering these research fields; program funding was renewed in 2016. The
overall goal of the SURP is to provide students with research, mentoring, and networking experiences; real-life
surgical observations; and simulated cardiovascular demonstrations to increase their interest in careers in
cardiovascular, pulmonary, and hematologic research. During the first funding period, approximately 95% of
participants were expected to complete a bachelor’s degree, with 75% continuing education in a graduate or
health profession program. During the second funding period, several SURP participants obtained their
bachelor’s degrees and enrolled in graduate or medical school. Since the program started in 2012, 78% of all
participants have completed a bachelor’s degree program; 54% are currently enrolled or have completed
graduate or medical school programs. Most program participants who have not continued on to a health-related
or graduate degree program are either preparing to apply to a graduate/health profession program or still actively
engaged in research. The SURP has been successful at providing students with positive summer research
experiences and long-term mentor-mentee relationships. To continue to build on the program’s success, we
propose the following aims: 1) recruit a diverse group of academically talented and enthusiastic undergraduate
students interested in pursuing careers in cardiovascular, pulmonary, or hematologic research; 2) support and
cultivate successful and rewarding mentor-mentee relationships; 3) develop and promote student leadership and
communication skills; 4) stimulate underrepresented and disadvantaged students’ interest in research and
health-related careers; and 5) evaluate the program and its activities annually to ensure student satisfaction and
program success. Exposing underrepresented and disadvantaged students to basic, clinical, and/or translational
research will provide a firm introduction and foundation to foster interest in research and health-related careers."

 IDH mutant gliomas are incurable, primary brain tumors that affect young to middle-aged adults and are
defined by a mutation in a key metabolic gene. Despite treatment with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy,
these gliomas exhibit unrelenting growth that ultimately leads to neurologic decline and premature death.
Interestingly, many types of tumor cells, including IDH mutant glioma, reprogram metabolic processes to promote
tumor growth. The overarching goal of this proposal is to target tumor-specific metabolic vulnerabilities to more
effectively halt IDH mutant glioma growth. This is based on preliminary data demonstrating that activation of the
critical metabolic regulator Sirt1, using Sirt1 activating compounds (STACs) or Sirt1 overexpression, leads to
cytotoxicity in IDH mutant cells, leading to the hypothesis that IDH mutant glioma sensitivity to Sirt1 activation is
related to IDH-induced metabolic rewiring. This five-year career development project is aimed at investigating
the metabolic underpinnings and effectiveness Sirt1 activation in IDH mutant gliomas using orthotopic mouse
models. This study will also determine the effectiveness of combining metabolic targeting with inhibition of the
cell cycle, a strategy based on the premise that targeting both processes may achieve more effective tumor
eradication. The first aim will test the anti-tumor effectiveness of STACs in combination with cell cycle inhibition
using patient-derived, IDH mutant glioma lines implanted intracerebrally. The second aim will utilize RNA-
sequencing to investigate the cellular processes influenced by STACs. The third aim will explore the ability of
caloric restriction, known to exert longevity-promoting effects through Sirt1 upregulation, to enhance cell cycle
inhibition and prevent glioma growth.
 Dr. Miller is a highly trained, passionate physician-scientist uniquely poised to make an impact on
treatment for glioma. She is an Instructor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School in the Pappas Center for
Neuro-Oncology at Massachusetts General Hospital. This K08 application is designed to build on previous
cancer research experience to develop expertise in studying glioma biology. Her mentors, Drs. Cahill and
Wakimoto, are leaders in the field of IDH mutant glioma metabolism and modeling. The proposed project will
also utilize collaborations with established leaders in single-cell transcriptomics and metabolism. This expertise
is complemented by the candidate’s scientific advisors, Dr. Brastianos and Dr. Batchelor, who are experts in
translational Neuro-Oncology. This award will be further supported by the unparalleled institutional support and
environment offered by Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Dr. Miller’s future goal is
to use the expertise gained during this award to study the effect of novel therapeutics in human patients with
glioma. The K08 is an important stepping stone for building a translational research program in Neuro-Oncology
and ultimately becoming an independent, R01-funded investigator."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death for U.S women, annually killing >400,000 women.
Compared to whites, non-Hispanic Black and Latina women are at higher CVD risk. Despite the burden of CVD
in women, risk factors specific to women are understudied and thus not considered in current CVD risk
prediction or prevention strategies. Early detection of subclinical disease is key to CVD risk stratification and
prevention. Since prenatal and postpartum care is the sole health care access point for most U.S. women,
pregnancy represents a critical opportunity to measure CVD risk and implement innovative strategies to
address this critical gap in women’s health care. Furthermore, CVD risk factor trajectories begin in utero and in
early life, so pregnancy is also an opportunity to identify CVD risk in children. Our long-range goal is to
identify and disseminate obstetric care practices that mitigate CVD risk for women and their children. The
objective of this prospective, multicenter study is to estimate CVD risk in healthy and medically complicated
pregnant women and their infants. We will also examine the relationships among personal, social, and
ecological factors and CVD risk for 3 years postpartum. Our primary outcomes are maternal and infant
central pulse wave velocity (PWV), a validated measure of arterial stiffness (vascular aging) that predicts CVD,
independent of other established CVD risk factors. We will enroll a cohort 840 pregnant women of diverse
race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status: 420 healthy and 420 women with preeclampsia, gestational diabetes,
and/or suspected fetal growth restriction. We will measure maternal and infant PWV, cardio-metabolic (e.g.,
blood pressure, lipids, adiposity, HbA1c) and inflammatory (e.g., hs-CRP, IL-6, adiponectin) markers of CVD
risk, and assess personal, social, and ecological factors at 34-40 weeks’ gestation, delivery, 6 months, 18
months, and 3 years. The study aims are the following: 1) Measure arterial stiffness by PWV during and after
pregnancy; 2) Measure infant/child PWV following healthy and complicated pregnancies; and 3)
Identify maternal and infant modifiable risk factors associated with CVD risk measured by PWV. To date, no
studies have longitudinally measured CVD risk in pregnant women and their infants, nor ascertained the effect
of biologic, personal, social, and/or ecological factors on CVD risk. Using a noninvasive measure of arterial
stiffness, we propose to determine CVD risk in a cohort of mother-infant dyads. Our interdisciplinary study
team of experts in CVD, high-risk pregnancy, exercise and sports physiology, CVD epidemiology, public
health, and cardiology are well poised to complete the proposed aims by using a synthesis of expertise to
achieve our common, shared goal of mitigate CVD risk for women and their children. We are proposing an
innovative paradigm shift in the goals of prenatal care to use pregnancy as a time in a woman’s life, particularly
if she is at high risk for CVD, to identify and mitigate early markers of CVD for herself and her offspring."
10842295,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – OVERALL
The genome editing community is celebrating the ten-year anniversary of landmark CRISPR papers in 2022.
What is notable to many in the field is tremendous technological advances in editing precision and versatility,
along with a Nobel Prize and billions of dollars of investment. However, there is a palpable sense that these
advances have not been translated into valuable drugs at a sufficient rate. In vivo gene editing still faces
substantial challenges, especially when it comes to safety, efficacy, and delivery. While the development of
EDIT-101, a viral vector carrying Cas9 to treat a rare retinal disorder (BRILLIANCE trial), provided a clear path
to the clinic for a genome editing therapeutic program, this path can be challenging to follow for others in the
field interested in developing human therapeutics. Viral strategies have several limitations involving an immune
response to vector elements and prolonged expression of the editor for the lifetime of the patient, heightening
off-target concerns. Newer editors like base editors cannot be readily packaged into common viral vectors, plus
there is a challenging supply chain for viral vector manufacturing. We seek to overcome the limitations with viral
delivery systems by using novel nonviral delivery systems termed the Silica NanoCapsule (SNC) and Target
Active Gene Editors (TAGE). They can efficiently deliver genome editors to the retina with high efficiency,
reaching levels of 10-70% that are among the best for nonviral delivery of editors to the eye and comparable to
viral delivery systems. Based on our strong published and preliminary data we propose to develop nonviral gene
editing products to treat Best Disease (BD) and Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA), two diseases affecting
ion channels of the retinal pigment epithelium (i.e., RPE channelopathies). Our team, spanning academia and
industry, will pursue the following aims. In Overall Aim 1, we evaluate the clinical readiness of a genome editor
targeting a post-mitotic cell through transient, localized, and nonviral delivery. To date, outside of the liver, only
viral editors have reached an IND for in vivo editing. Here, we rigorously evaluate the potential of our SNC and
TAGE nonviral delivery systems for the treatment of LCA and BD. We invest our most significant effort into the
Lead Project 1 that develops a base editor within a SNC. This project will reach an IND within five years and
provide synergy for other projects. In Overall Aim 2, we create a platform that can address many rare diseases
of the eye by streamlined manufacturing of different guides with a simple pipeline for preclinical testing. In Overall
Aim 3, we provide the SCGE Consortium and broader genome editing field a set of regulatory interactions that
clarifies development path to the clinic for new gene editing therapies. Finally, through our experience with BD,
we expect to learn about the regulatory path in developing somatic cell genome editors for scenarios when no
suitable animal model exists. Because the majority of known pathological mutations in the eye have no suitable
animal models, sharing this knowledge will have a large impact on subsequent genome editing leads."
10842296,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
The CRISPR Vision Program is a truly team science unique effort to advance gene editing therapeutic
candidates for several retinal channelopathies towards the clinic. This proposal leverages synergy between
discoveries in engineering and biology and requires close collaborations and contacts between academic
labs, industry partners, regulatory professionals, manufacturing facilities, the National Institutes of Health
(NIH), and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This large effort therefore requires strong
administrative support from the Administrative (Admin) Core, whose overarching goal is to ensure efficiency,
teamwork, and synergy among the Projects and Cores by providing infrastructure spanning software,
meetings, finances, staffing, logistics, communications, and publications. All these activities are critical to an
innovative team science approach taken by the CRISPR Vision Program. The Admin Core builds on
organizational principles that have proven successful during Phase I of the SCGE and several extramural
projects since 2018. These principles include several supporting functions including communication, record
keeping, process reports, publications, infrastructure, working relationships with university admin, software
tools, and many more. In practice, four primary tasks will be executed. First, the Admin Core will assign and
manage personnel to ensure all Projects and Cores are appropriately staffed and form committees to oversee
all duties. The Admin Core will perform project management tasks based on the information they collect from
regular meetings, comparison of progress to the phase timelines, and other factors. Second, the Admin Core
will support communication and synergy among team members through organizing regular meetings,
adopting standard practices for data and protocol sharing, and providing software tools to assist with project
management and team communication. Third, the Admin Core will coordinate external communications of
research, datasets, protocols, and processes including information sharing with the NIH, the SCGE
Consortium Translational Coordination and Dissemination Center, and across other Centers, and
dissemination and publication of results and resources. Finally, the Admin Core will provide financial
management, interface with institutional administration, and ensure the cost-effective use of resources across
the Projects and Cores. Overall, the Admin Core will help integrate the Projects so that true Team Science
can be achieved within each Project and also between Projects. The points of synergy are expected to provide
a rapid translation of promising genome editing technology into the clinic. The Admin Core will be led by Dr.
Krishanu Saha, who brings leadership experience with many large team science initiatives including the
Phase I of the SCGE. The Core will benefit from a Program Manager who will execute the tasks above with
Dr. Saha and an experienced set of grants administrators at the University of Wisconsin-Madison."
10842298,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – HUMAN CELL ASSAYS CORE
The overarching goal of this Core is to support the preclinical and IND-enabling studies in human cells with the
therapeutic leads generated in Projects 1-3. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are a unique cell source to
generate retinal cells, tissue, and organoids. The unique attributes of hPSC model systems are particularly
critical for diseases that have high genotypic diversity, like channelopathies, as generating an animal model with
a knocked-in human allele for every patient mutation would be time and cost prohibitive and – even if
accomplished – would not provide a platform to assess potential off-target effects. Assays using hPSC-derived
cells, organoids, and tissues containing pathogenic mutations can provide patient-relevant information regarding
(1) the efficiency of intended on-target editing of mutant alleles, (2) the frequency of unintended on-target
genomic editing outcomes (e.g., large deletions, translocations) and off-target genomic editing (in both the target
cell type and other cell types exposed to the therapeutic product), and (3) the strength of functional rescue and
adverse responses. Because our proposed subretinal route of nonviral editor administration will likely deliver
payload to photoreceptors (PRs) as a cellular off-target, we developed an imaging and single cell transcriptional
pipeline to identify biomarkers of adverse events in PR-containing hPSC-derived retinal organoids (ROs),
pioneered by our team. We will apply these tools to profile potential adverse events in PRs, including changes
in phototransduction, p53 response, and innate immune response. We plan to produce iPSC-RPE suitable for
on- and off-target analysis of therapeutic editors, perform electrophysiology assays for functional
analysis of iPSC-RPE treated with therapeutic candidates, and produce hPSC-ROs for profiling potential
adverse events in human photoreceptors exposed to therapeutic candidates. The expected outcomes of
HCA Core activities include continuous provision or execution of disease-relevant, rigorous, and reproducible
human cell products and ion channel assays. We expect to leverage a world-class stem cell biology and
bioengineering community at the University of Wisconsin-Madison to pave the way to use hPSCs in IND-enabling
studies in the genome editing field. If successful, this effort could reduce the need for preclinical animal models
and provide relevant safety and efficacy information to accelerate the translation of genome editing into first-in-
human trials."
10842301,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – LARGE ANIMAL CORE
To achieve the aims of the CRISPR Vision Program, it will be critically important to determine acceptable dosage
and toxicity levels (if any) of therapeutic candidates using nonhuman primates (NHPs). The NHP eye has much
greater similarity to the human eye than that of any other species commonly used for research and drug testing.
For example, the NHP is the only non-human mammal that has a macula. In humans, the macula is susceptible
to a number of pathological conditions such as age-related macular degeneration and is often the part of the
human retina most adversely affected by drug toxicity. Hence, evaluating the effects of test articles containing
genome editors on the NHP eye, and the macula in particular, will be highly informative for safety assessments
by the FDA. The Large Animal Core will provide the surgical and in vivo testing expertise to determine the
suitability and practicality of the proposed subretinal dosing route in NHPs. The Large Animal Core will also
monitor the NHPs during and after test article dosing for signs of both local (i.e., proximal to the subretinal bleb)
and distal retinal and general ocular toxicity. The animals will be monitored for behavior and other indications of
systemic toxicity, as well. The Core will be administered under the following three Tasks to support all of the
CRISPR Vision Projects. In Task 1, the Large Animal Core will administer the test article subretinally in a
surgically sterile manner using a trans-vitreous approach, small-gauge pars plana vitrectomy equipment, and
automated subretinal injector. In Task 2, the Large Animal Core will perform in vivo toxicity evaluations. The
animals will be monitored both functionally and morphologically for in vivo signs of ocular toxicity following
subretinal dosing. Photopic and scotopic full-field electroretinography (ERG) testing will determine the health of
the entire retina. Photopic multifocal ERG will be used to assess possible localized retinal injury, either from the
subretinal injection procedure itself or localized toxicity of the test article. Morphological determinations will
include ocular examinations, color fundus photographs, fluorescein angiography and spectral domain optical
coherence tomography. In Task 3, the Large Animal Core will perform necropsy and eye retrieval for purposes
of determining drug distribution and histopathological signs of drug toxicity. The expertise and centralization of
these studies in the Large Animal Core will ensure efficient, standardized assessment of lead therapeutic
products nominated by all three CRISPR Vision Program Projects, with near real-time data return to inform
Project evolution. The extensive history of the Core Lead, Dr. Nork, with developing methods for subretinal
injection and ocular evaluations will provide nimble protocol innovation if required over the span of the partner
Projects."

10836484,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Even with immune checkpoint blockade therapy (ICBT), most patients with metastatic bladder cancer (BC) die
of their disease. In the previous funding period, we studied CD24, a metastasis driver and prognostic marker.
Our most translationally significant finding is induction of CD24 expression by Discoidin Domain Receptor
Tyrosine Kinase 2 (DDR2), a collagen-activated receptor that is therapeutically actionable. In human BC, DDR2
expression was associated with poor patient prognosis, the aggressive and ICBT insensitive basal squamous
tumor subtype (BSS), TGFβ signaling, immunosuppressive (M2) macrophages (Mφ) and a fibroblast-enriched,
tumor microenvironment. These results raised the intriguing possibility that DDR2 is a lynchpin driver of both
metastasis and ICBT resistance. To explore this possibility, we developed an shRNA based functional screen in
syngeneic murine BC models to probe DDR2 and other selected “druggable” targets evaluated in BC clinical
trials for their synergism with αPD-1, a common ICBT in BC. We found the most robust tumor reduction with
depletion of DDR2 and this was recapitulated with the Tyr kinase inhibitor, dasatinib. This result was compelling
because it defined a novel synergistic combination therapy with αPD-1 that, unlike CD24 targeting, is actionable
in the near term in patients. To begin elucidating the mechanisms DDR2 may use to drive tumor metastasis and
ICBT resistance, we profiled DDR2-silenced murine BC tumors with RNA-seq. We identified 69 genes
downregulated >2 fold by DDR2 depletion and used these to construct a DDR2 Effector Signature (DES). Low
tumor DES scores of surgically or αPD-L1 treated patients associated with better outcome, supporting a role for
DES genes in progression and αPD-L1 response. Remarkably, MMP10 or S100A2 expression each alone
stratified outcome nearly as well as the DES score in surgery and αPD-L1 treatment and they were implicated
in Mφ, TGFβ and fibroblast biology. These findings and the lack of genes associated with T-cell exhaustion in
DES, lead us to propose our innovative Guiding Hypothesis that cancer cell DDR2 establishes the BSS and
uses MMP10 and S100A2 to engage M2 Mφ and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) to promote metastasis
and αPD-(L)1 resistance. Specific Aims test this hypothesis with the Objective to develop new effective
treatments for metastatic BC. Aim 1 will use full and conditional DDR2-null mice exposed to chemical
carcinogens to test the hypothesis that DDR2 expression in basal urothelial cells is necessary for BSS tumor
development and progression. Aim 2 will treat murine tumors with alterations in DDR2, MMP10 and S100A2
expression grown in genetically engineered mice with fibroblast and Mφ defects, with αPD-1, to test the
hypothesis that cancer cell DDR2 drives MMP10 and S100A2 and via their actions in Mφ and fibroblasts
contribute to metastasis and αPD-1 resistance. Since even with DDR2+PD-1 blockade, not all tumors are cured,
Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that inhibition DPP4, a peptidase and Coronavirus receptor we discovered as a
potential driver of resistance to DDR2+PD-1 blockade, can improve effectiveness of such therapy."

This GREAT Program will develop genomics opportunities for students at Prairie View A&M
University (PVAMU) through a collaboration with Texas A&M University (TAMU) TAMU is one of
the largest Hispanic-serving institutions in the United States with over 4000 students majoring in
biomedical or biological sciences, and PVAMU is an HBCU comprised of 86% black students and
>50% first generation students. While these institutions are separated by 40 miles, there have
historically been few collaborations in the area of biomedical science. This program will develop
a Course-based undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) focusing on using genomic and
bioinformatic approaches to predict the function of unannotated genes. The CURE will be co-
taught by PVAMU and TAMU faculty. Over the summer students will participate in research in a
TAMU genomics lab. These research opportunities will be complemented by workshops,
networking events, and other training opportunities. Together, the proposed program will foster
critical thinking, self-empowerment, and provides students the skills and training necessary to
enter PhD programs in genomics, or to enter the workforce in a genomics-related area. Taken
together, this program will strengthen genomics programming at PVAMU, develop ties between
the two universities, and promote diversity in genomic sciences."
10914231,"The main objectives of this proposal are to (i) identify volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) that cause goblet cell metaplasia (GCM) and mucus hypersecretion in Cystic
Fibrosis (CF) airways, (ii) characterize the mechanism of induction, and (iii) determine its importance to CF
pathogenesis. PA is a frequent cause of acute and chronical lung infections, including CF and non-CF
bronchiectasis, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Infections by PA are associated with a significant increase in morbidity and mortality in these patients. One of
the major pathological features shared by these diseased lungs is in their dysregulated, hypersecretion of mucus
and failure in clearance, resulting in clogged airways that reduces gas exchanges and deteriorates lung function.
PA is known to secrete a variety of secondary metabolites, including the VOCs. In recent years, microbial VOCs
detected in the breath of patients have been scrutinized as potential biomarkers for disease diagnosis, including
CF, VAP and COPD. Unfortunately, the biological effects of VOCs on lung pathogenesis, including GCM and
mucus hypersecretion, are poorly understood. In preliminary studies, we demonstrate that several dominant
species of PA VOCs previously identified in the breath of people with CF (e.g., 2-aminoacetophenone, 2-AA)
induce GCM and mucus hypersecretion in human airway epithelial cells, and in mice. In this application, we will
test the hypothesis that VOCs are major contributors of GCM and mucus hypersecretion in the diseased airways.
Aim 1 will characterize major PA VOC species individually and in a cocktail that are capable of inducing GCM
and mucus secretion in normal human primary bronchial epithelial cells (NHBECs) vs. CF diseased primary
bronchial epithelial cells (CF-DHBECs) cultured in the air-liquid interface (ALI), under normoxic and hypoxic
conditions, mimicking normal and CF airways, respectively. Top VOCs will be further examined individually or
in cocktail for their ability to induce GCM and mucus hypersecretion in wild-type vs. b-ENAC overexpressing
(Scnn1b-Tg) CF mice. Finally, both wild-type PA strain PA14 and its isogenic DpqsE mutant deficient in 2-AA
will be compared for their ability to induce GCM and mucus hypersecretion in wild-type vs. b-ENAC mice. Aim
2 will examine mechanisms of GCM and mucus biosynthesis induction by PA VOCs. First, we will determine
whether VOCs activate pro-GCM pathways, including AhR and EGFR-AKT/ERK1/2, to inhibit the expression of
FOXA2, a key regulator of airway mucus homeostasis. Then, we will examine if VOCs also induce GCM and
mucus biosynthesis by modulating macrophage polarization, neutrophil influx and Th1/Th2/Th17/ILC2s immune
responses, which are known drivers of GCM and mucus hypersecretion in diseased airways. Completion of the
proposal will reveal the mechanistic link between VOCs and excessive mucus in CF and other diseased lungs,
and, potentially novel therapeutic approaches against bacterial pneumonias."
10804658,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Craniofacial abnormalities are some of the most common birth defects. Although cleft lip and/or palate and
craniosynostosis are the most common craniofacial defects, craniofacial microsomia (CFM) is estimated to be
the third most prevalent cranial anomaly, occurring at between 1 in 3000 – 1 in 6000 live births. Although the
symptoms of CFM can vary widely in severity, they share a variety of features consistent with abnormal
development of first and second pharyngeal arches, including a shortening of the mandible, microtia,
preauricular tags and epibulbar dermoids. These defects are typically, but not exclusively unilateral, and
although some families presenting with CFM have been identified, most are considered sporadic and have no
genetic diagnosis. Difficulties in understanding the origins of CFM include its heterogeneity, the lack of clear
underlying molecular mechanisms and the paucity of good animal models for these disorders.
We have identified a transcription factor, Foxi3, that is expressed early and broadly in pharyngeal ectoderm
and endoderm, and is later restricted to the pharyngeal pouches and clefts. Foxi3 mutant mice show severe
defects in most pharyngeal arch derivatives – for example, the mutants lack much of the lower jaw, and have a
complete loss of the middle ear ossicles and the external ear. Recently, our colleagues found over 20 human
variants in Foxi3 associated with craniofacial defects including CFM and microtia, and our preliminary data
suggests these defects can be modeled in mice carrying some of these variants. Moreover, the Gata3
transcription factor, which has been associated with CFM in genome-wide association studies, is co-expressed
with Foxi3 in several developing cranial tissues and has also recently been shown to cause CFM phenotypes
when mutated in mice. This raises the possibility that Foxi3 and Gata3 interact genetically during craniofacial
development.
In this proposal, we will first attempt to create a mouse model of CFM using Foxi3 mutant alleles created in our
lab and Gata3 mutant alleles characterized by our collaborators. Second, we will perform a bioinformatic
analysis of the gene regulatory networks controlled by Foxi3 and Gata3, by analyzing gene expression in
pharyngeal tissue from Foxi3 homozygous mutants, heterozygous mutant and wild type mice, and by
performing CUT&RUN on pharyngeal tissue to identify direct targets of Foxi3 and Gata3. Finally, we will
address the role of Foxi3 during early craniofacial development by performing conditional deletions of Foxi3 in
pharyngeal ectoderm and endoderm and determining its contribution to normal craniofacial development in
each tissue."

Maternal experiences of psychosocial stress (e.g., stressful life events, perceived stress, job strain, poor social
support) are associated with an increased risk of preterm birth and inflammation during pregnancy has been
implicated as a key mechanistic pathway. Epidemiologic studies have observed positive relationships between
psychosocial stressors and maternal inflammation levels. Similarly, inflammatory biomarkers, measured in
maternal samples during the second and third trimesters, have been associated with preterm birth. However,
how psychosocial stress and maternal inflammation both influence fetal inflammation during early to mid-
gestation remains unknown. This is problematic because most studies rely on maternal samples as proxies of
fetal health during mid-pregnancy. This knowledge gap persists in large part due to logistical and ethical
challenges in obtaining fetal tissue samples during mid-gestation. Closing this knowledge gap has implications
for improving fetal health across pregnancy, as elevated levels of maternal inflammation during early pregnancy
may lead to elevated levels of fetal inflammation later in gestation, which in turn can affect fetal development
and child health outcomes. Communities of color and low socioeconomic status individuals experience the
highest burden of multiple psychosocial stressors and are disproportionately affected by structural discrimination.
Accordingly, we will utilize a unique cohort of pregnant people who underwent elective pregnancy terminations
during the second trimester in San Francisco, CA between 2010 and 2016. This study population is racially,
ethnically, and demographically diverse, serving primarily low-income women of color with public health
insurance. We will, for the first time, measure a comprehensive panel of 24 inflammatory biomarkers in 114
previously banked maternal and cord sera and placenta samples. In parallel, we will quantify levels of
corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), FMS-like tyrosine kinase receptor (FLT1), and placental growth factor
(PlGF) in maternal sera. Our study, which leverages hard to obtain biospecimens from a critically important time
period, will be the first to examine the relationship between psychosocial stress and fetal inflammation during
mid-gestation. We will determine differences in abundances and assess correlations among biomarkers across
the three matrices (Aim 1). Further, we will examine relationships between psychosocial stress and maternal
and fetal inflammation and create inflammation scores for each matrix using factor analysis (Aim 2). We will also
use structural equation modeling to assess whether inflammation measured in cord serum is influenced by and
associated with maternal and placenta inflammation levels (Aim 3). Importantly, results from our study will
provide important insights on the health effects of historically marginalized populations during a time period that
is difficult to study. Understanding the origins of fetal inflammation during mid-gestation and its relationship with
maternal inflammation can inform future studies that must rely on maternal measures as proxies for fetal
inflammation and elucidate intervention opportunities at biologically relevant time periods to improve fetal growth."

 Recovery from Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is comprised of two factors: (1) cessation of
heavy drinking and (2) remission from a DSM-5 AUD diagnosis (NIAAA, 2021). Recognizing
both the chronicity of AUD and high relapse rates, recovery is a process that unfolds over time
and is categorized based on duration: initial (up to 3 months), early (3 months to one year),
sustained (1-5 years), and stable (5 or more years). Across these different recovery durations,
negative affect (NA) is a common precipitant of relapse or return to a non-recovery status
(Lowman et al., 1996; Marlatt & Gordon, 1985; Witkiewitz & Villarroel, 2009). However, most
studies examining the relationship of negative affect and relapse report only mean levels of
negative affect. Emotion dynamics, including negative affect variability and emotion
differentiation, have been shown to provide additional, unique information not captured in mean-
level estimates (Colgan et al., 2019; Erbas et al., 2021; Jenkins et al., 2020). Information
provided by emotion dynamics can provide a more nuanced understanding of how negative
affect impacts recovery status and how affect regulation may vary as a function of recovery
duration. Ultimately, knowledge of how emotion dynamics operate in NIAAA recovery may
assist with identifying optimal timing of intervention and re-intervention during different recovery
durations
 In order to better to understand the relationship of negative affect variability and alcohol
recovery, this study proposes to recruit individuals in each of the first 3 recovery durations (e.g.,
initial, early, and sustained) who have achieved cessation of heavy drinking and remission from
a DSM-5 AUD diagnosis and thus meet NIAAA criteria for AUD recovery. By combining a
baseline assessment with 28 days of EMA reporting, it is possible to study the relationship of
emotion dynamics to alcohol consumption in AUD recovery and explore covariates that may
help to explain this relationship."

Alzheimer’s Disease is more prevalent in women than men, yet a biological basis for this sex difference is not
understood. The primary objective of this proposal is to understand how 17β-estradiol (E2) regulates microRNA
(miR) biogenesis and stability across the lifespan and in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). We hypothesize that
dysregulation of E2-mediated miR expression in the aged brain leads to greater Alzheimer Disease risk in
women. The studies proposed are focused on understanding how estrogens regulate these miRs to get a
better understanding of their dysregulation in AD - specifically in women. This will address a major gap in our
understanding because how E2 influences the components of the miR biogenesis pathway to regulate mature
miR expression levels in a cell- and/or age-specific manner is unknown, despite several studies demonstrating
temporal and cell-specific effects of E2 on miR expression in a variety of organ systems. Our prior studies
demonstrated that E2 treatment altered the expression levels of a subset of miRs in the female brain, and the
ability to regulate these miRs depended on age, brain region, and length of E2 deprivation (i.e., time post-
menopause). Collectively the experiments in Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that E2 differentially mediates
mature miR stability depending on age and in Alzheimer’s Disease. We will use miR degradation assays to
determine whether age and/or E2 affect the rate of miR degradation and, using a proteomics approach, identify
the cis- and trans-acting factors that regulate miR stability. Aim 2 will addresses mechanistically how a select
subset of miRs could be specifically regulated by E2 post-transcription. We will test the hypothesis that hnRNP
H binding to ERβ reduces its association with pri-miR transcripts, ERβ interacts with BRCA1 to differentially
facilitate DROSHA complex assembly, and that these interactions are dependent on age and E2 treatment.
Aim 3 will determine the effects of age and E2 on miR subcellular localization and assess disruption of E2-
mediated miR subcellular localization in Alzheimer’s Disease. This aim will test the hypothesis that E2 facilitates
subcellular trafficking of miRs, thereby impacting miR function. Moreover, we will test the hypothesis that miR
subcellular localization changes across the lifespan and that normal age-related subcellular localization is
disrupted in Alzheimer’s Disease. Impact: Understanding the basic molecular signaling pathways of E2 in the
aging brain will help drive therapeutic advances and inform treatment strategies for women with Alzheimer’s
Disease."

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global epidemic, with one-fourth of the current world population infected and
approximately 10 million new active cases annually. However, our knowledge about the causative agent,
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is still limited, and the only licensed TB vaccine (BCG) is inadequate to
control the epidemic. It is critical to better understand the biological difference between Mtb and BCG in order
to develop a more effective TB vaccine. Our long-term goal of this project is to develop a novel
recombinant BCG vaccine to better control TB. Recently, cyclic di-AMP (c-di-AMP) has been recognized as
a new bacterial signaling molecule and a potent vaccine adjuvant. We have demonstrated that Mtb Rv3586
(disA) encodes a diadenylate cyclase and Rv2837c (cnpB) encodes a c-di-AMP phosphodiesterase.
Compared to the Mtb wild-type (WT), ∆cnpB secretes a significantly larger amount of c-di-AMP and stimulates
a stronger type I interferon (IFN-I) response in the infected macrophages. We have also revealed that BCG
∆cnpB produces but does not secrete c-di-AMP; both c-di-AMP secretion and Mtb region of difference 1 (RD1)
are required for the c-di-AMP-induced IFN-I response. Interestingly, it is well known that BCG is defective in
inducing IFN-I, and addition of IFN-I enhances BCG's immunogenicity. Moreover, c-di-AMP has been utilized
as a potential vaccine adjuvant that elicits strong humoral and cellular immune response. Overproduction of c-
di-AMP in BCG by expressing disA also results in better protection in infected animals. However, the
improvement is moderate likely because that the recombinant BCG is still unable to secrete c-di-AMP and
induce substantial IFN-I. Therefore, we hypothesize that manipulation of c-di-AMP homeostasis and secretion
in BCG will enable BCG to provide a better protection against TB. The objective of this application is to
construct a recombinant BCG that secretes c-di-AMP and induces optimal levels of IFN-I response during
vaccination. We propose two specific aims: (1) to construct c-di-AMP-secreting recombinant BCG strains, and
(2) to evaluate the recombinant BCG strains in induction of IFN-I and protection against Mtb infection. These
recombinant BCG strains will be very likely superior to the current BCG in vaccine efficacy. Furthermore, our
findings will also provide fundamental insights into vaccine strategies for other bacterial pathogens. Thus, this
proposal has a broad impact on public health."
10813037,"Factors contributing to poor outcomes among minority patients with asthma include poverty and other social
determinants of health (SDoH), poor medication adherence and self-management skills, and environmental
exposures. There are challenges in providing asthma education in the outpatient setting, such as time constraints
and prioritizing acute symptoms or recent exacerbations. The lack of proven, guideline-based, and user-centered
mobile platforms that promote self-management and shared decision-making among patients with asthma is an
important unmet need. Vocal biomarker technology using machine learning can assess a patient’s respiratory
dysfunction and is generalizable to multiple respiratory conditions. On the basis of a 6-second voice sample, this
vocal biomarker technology has been shown to detect patients with asthma while correlating with the degree of
asthma control. Through an AHRQ-funded study, we recently created the ASTHMAXcel PRO (patient-reported
outcome) mobile app for outpatient settings to promote asthma self-management through the collection of PROs,
animated videos, goal setting, personalized algorithms, and push notifications. The present study will further
enhance our mobile platform’s capabilities to implement PROs by creating ASTHMAXcel Voice. This mobile
platform will include a respiratory symptoms risk score based on vocal biomarker technology, facilitate shared
decision-making and SDoH screening and referrals, and enable self-management and remote care coordination.
We will adapt, test, and refine ASTHMAXcel Voice (R21 phase) for the outpatient setting (Aim 1). We will
remotely conduct pre-adaptation focus groups with patients, healthcare providers (HCPs), social workers (SWs),
community health workers (CHWs), and expert stakeholders on how to best adapt ASTHMAXcel Voice. We will
test the adapted platform with 30 patients, 6 HCPs, 2 SWs and 2 CHWs and conduct formative and summative
evaluation of the platform’s functionality and usability, and iteratively refine it based on feedback. We will repeat
this process for a second round. We will then remotely conduct an RCT (R33 phase) among outpatient primary
and specialty care sites from Montefiore Medical Center to compare the adapted and refined ASTHMAXcel Voice
(n=100) to usual care (n=100) on clinical outcomes (asthma control as primary endpoint, asthma emergency
department (ED) visits), process outcomes (patient and provider satisfaction and usage, degree of shared
decision-making), SDoH screening and referral rates, asthma quality of life (QOL), medication adherence, and
self-efficacy (Aim 2). Assessments will occur at baseline, 2-, and 6-month follow-up. We will evaluate the process
of ASTHMAXcel Voice implementation within the outpatient setting using the RE-AIM framework (Aim 3). Future
enhancements of the mobile platform will include other chronic diseases, risk prediction, and widespread
dissemination."

Juvenile justice-involved youth (JJIY), primarily adolescents ages 13-17, are a complex and highly vulnerable
population who have high rates of psychiatric disorders, suicidality, trauma, and lower socioeconomic status.
Minoritized youth (by race) are disproportionately represented among JJIY. Though the need for mental health
services is pervasive among this population, only 20-25% of JJIY receive mental health treatment while involved
in the juvenile justice system, with even lower rates among racial minorities. All of these factors are associated
with poor sleep; further, poor sleep quality and insomnia are widespread among incarcerated adults. Yet, there
has not been a systematic study of the sleep of JJIY, the correlates of sleep in this population, nor the options
for implementing evidence-based sleep-focused treatments in various juvenile justice system settings. This is a
critical gap in the literature, especially because sleep promotion is associated with reduced psychopathology.
We propose a descriptive, mixed-methods study to 1) examine the nature and correlates of sleep among JJIY;
2) identify points of intervention in the juvenile justice system where sleep treatment can be delivered, personnel
who can deliver it, and the resources needed to do so; and 3) identify strategies for effective translation and
implementation of evidence-based sleep-focused interventions in system settings. We will conduct a cross-
sectional survey of JJIY (13-17y; n=25 in residential placement, n=75 under community supervision, reflecting
national rates). Youth will complete a daily sleep diary and a subset (n=40) wear actigraphy for 10 days. Parents
and adult caregivers will be invited to complete a complementary survey (n=100). To obtain further information,
we will invite 20 of the full sample of 100 youth to participate in one-on-one qualitative interviews. We focus on
ages 13-17 given the rapid and interacting changes in sleep, emotion regulation, and behavioral regulation during
this period. We will also conduct qualitative interviews with 20 individuals working in the juvenile justice system
(residential counselors, probation officers, healthcare providers). Survey data will be preliminarily analyzed to
inform the interviews. Then, in Year 2 we will conduct and analyze the interviews using Rapid Qualitative Inquiry,
and we will conduct quantitative data cleaning and full analysis. We will rely on stakeholder-engaged research,
which values community members as equitable research partners and may result in more sustainable and
effective programs by tailoring the program to the community context. This work aligns with the NIMH Strategic
Plan Objective 4.3: to conduct research that optimizes and improves access to existing programs that improve
mental health services for underserved populations. This R21 will constitute the essential first step in a program
of research that will include further developing and adapting existing sleep interventions to target the sleep
patterns, problems, and determinants of sleep relevant to JJIY, translating these interventions for implementation
in juvenile justice settings, and testing these programs among JJIY in various system settings."
10835103,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Adolescents and young adults (AYA) are exposed to, share, and create content about non-cigarette other
tobacco products (OTP) on social media, which has been demonstrated to shape tobacco-related perceptions
and behaviors. New research has documented content that promotes negative health behaviors including OTP
use on TikTok, a social media app on which users create and share short-form videos and that is regularly
used by more than 60% of US teens. However, TikTok content changes quickly, and it is unknown what OTP
message and delivery features are used on TikTok, especially over time, and how they affect message reach
and engagement. The long-term goals of this research program are to elucidate social media’s influence on
AYA OTP use and to inform unique up-to-date regulatory and public health interventions appropriate for
different tobacco products, social media platforms, and generations of young people. The overall objective of
this application is to identify what and how OTP messages (i.e., perceptions, opinions, advice, information) are
conveyed in short-form social media videos created by TikTok users using an adaptive community-engaged
approach. The rationale is that adaptive youth-engaged investigation will illuminate how social media might
perpetuate pro-tobacco sentiments in a way that is transferable to other platforms and risk behaviors over time.
The objective will be addressed with three aims: (1) Identify and characterize underlying messages (e.g.,
perceptions, information) in OTP content on the short-form video-based social media platform TikTok, (2)
Elucidate how delivery features (i.e., app features, creator choices) convey OTP messages on TikTok; (3)
Estimate the relationships between key OTP messages and delivery features and video reach (i.e., views) and
engagement (e.g., likes, comments) on TikTok. These aims will be accomplished in a longitudinal
observational study that identifies OTP TikTok content by training the TikTok algorithm to push relevant
content to TikTok’s For You Page (i.e., “feed”) for multiple accounts. The study leverages both qualitative and
quantitative analytic techniques and engages YA researchers at two sites in all aspects of study design,
execution, and dissemination. The research proposed is innovative, in the applicants’ opinion, because its
immersive, youth-engaged approach can simulate the user experience and provide rich, rigorous,
interpretation of the OTP messages embedded in AYA’s social media environment. The proposed research is
significant because it will help scholars and practitioners contextualize AYA OTP use in the information
environment on TikTok and, by identifying video features that stay popular and engaging over time, it can
enhance the authenticity of health communication that counters pro-tobacco sentiments on TikTok. Ultimately,
such knowledge has the potential to enhance primary prevention efforts that reduce AYA nicotine addiction
and tobacco use."

NEUFIN (Neuroscience in First Nations) is a unique advanced research training and mentoring
program focused on the indigenous minorities of South America, one of the most underserved
populations in the globe. Over the past five years we completed two cycles of advanced training -in the
context of an international master of science degree - and capacity development, for scholars and
faculty of First Nations from Bolivia, Peru and Argentina. We will continue to build capacity and train
Quechua neuroscientists on clinical research applications of neuroimaging, genetics, epidemiology,
neuropsychology and neuromodulation. We will also create personalized training environments and an
innovation ecosystem online to support capacity and career development for Quechua neuroscientists
after completion of their initial degree. The Training Program consists of the following components:
1. Graduate Program in Neuroscience for First Nations to train Quechua speaking scientists for
multidisciplinary research studies in clinical and translational neurosciences, epidemiology, imaging,
and genetics research. Support includes 24-month scholarships and tuition towards a Master of
Sciences in Neuroscience based at Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, but including mentored
research rotations at University of Texas Health San Antonio, Harvard Medical School or Washington
University School of Medicine, and for three semesters at South American institutions. Funds will be
available for pilot and reinsertion small grants after graduation. Mentorship and initial work towards
enrollment in a PhD at University of Buenos Aires will be supported as well.
2. Ecosystem of Innovation in First Nations to provide a personalized learning, training and mentoring
environment for a diverse group of scientists, focused on precision and personalized medicine

In response to PAR-18-901, we propose the Sustainable Academic Capacity Building for Excellence through
Research and Training (SACERT) Program. Under the leadership of two US- and two South Africa-based
highly experienced Principal Investigators, SACERT goals are to increase timely progression to completion of
doctoral degree primarily among underrepresented pre-doctoral students, and to improve the educational and
mentoring climates of 12 participating institutions in South Africa. The focus of SACERT is chronic stress and
non-communicable chronic mental disorders including substance abuse, depression, and posttraumatic stress
disorder across the life course. SACERT responds directly to current national governmental initiatives to train
pre-doctoral students who are at the dissertation stage in the mental health field. We focus particularly on
building capacity of scholars in the nursing, social work, occupational therapy, psychology, psychiatry, and
public health fields to conduct translational mental health-related research via two pathways, Tracks A and B.
We will provide short-, medium-, and long-term research training which includes coursework and research
training in an intensive 3-month in-residence training at UCLA and a long-term mentorship (Track A), as well as
annual workshops in South Africa (Track B). The Specific Aims are to: 1) Implement a two-year
multidisciplinary training program at UCLA and in South Africa for four pre-doctoral Scholars (“Track A,” who
will be post-master’s degree, with approved dissertation proposals) per year (cumulative n=16) to: a) enhance
their research skills in the areas of chronic stress and non-communicable chronic mental health disorders, b)
support their research productivity during the two-year tenure, and c) strengthen their relationships with
mentors; 2) Implement a training model involving annual virtual and/or in-person modular workshops for the
Aim 1 Scholars (n=4/year) and mentors (n=4/year) and additional Scholars who will be master’s and pre-
doctoral students (“Track B”; n=36/year for four years; cumulative n=144) and faculty (n=36/year), primarily
from historically disadvantaged universities, to: a) strengthen research and mentoring skills related to chronic
stress and non-communicable chronic mental health disorders, b) build and sustain a supportive network of
Scholars and mentors across primarily historically disadvantaged universities, and c) disseminate the results of
Scholars’ and mentors’ research related to chronic stress and non-communicable chronic mental health
disorders; 3) Provide mentorship training to Scholars’ mentors (n~16/year) to: a) enrich the mentor-scholar
dyad, b) increase capacity in South African university environments, and c) promote sustainability of our
research mentorship model; and 4) Evaluate these training and mentorship efforts with regard to: a) time to
degree, productivity related to publications and grant proposals; sustainability of training and mentoring (Track
A) and b) knowledge and skills gained (short- and long-term), and satisfaction with educational and mentoring
climate (Tracks A & B)."
10886000,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The immune system is an important and dynamic regulator of metabolism. In peripheral tissues, over-nutrition
and obesity lead to marked changes in immune cell population, causing associated shifts in signaling and
tissue function. While type I immunity is associated with the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and insulin
resistance, type II immunity has been shown to promote beige fat biogenesis, glucose homeostasis, and
energy balance. In the brain, activation of the pro-inflammatory NF-kB signaling pathway can lead to
hyperphagia and metabolic dysfunction. Whether activation of type II immune signaling pathways can restore
energy balance and protect against obesity has not yet been investigated. IL-13 is a Th2 cytokine that signals
through its cellular receptor IL-13R1. Whole body deletion of Il13ra1 causes obesity and loss of blood glucose
homeostasis. Il13ra1 is expressed in the subtantia nigra and ventral tegmental area of the brain. Preliminary
data show that specific deletion of Il13ra1 from the dopaminergic midbrain at least partially reproduces the
metabolic phenotypes of the whole-body knockout. The substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area are the
primary producers of dopamine in the CNS. Numerous studies have related central dopamine activity to energy
balance. In this study, we will test the hypothesis that central IL-13 signals through its receptor in the
dopaminergic midbrain to maintain energy balance. We will investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms
by which it does so. We will use both gain-of-function and loss-of-function genetic models to test our
hypothesis. Knowledge from this study is expected to fill major gaps in our understanding of how the immune
system interacts with the nervous system to coordinate metabolic regulation, and also to identify novel
pathways in the CNS that modulate energy balance."
10913521,"PROJECT SUMMARY
To date over 16 million people in the US have been infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 virus (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). While the vast
majority will survive the acute illness, many are at risk for experiencing long-term symptoms after the acute
illness. Acute neurologic symptoms including encephalitis, strokes and seizures have been reported in COVID-
19 patients. Increasingly, even survivors without acute neurologic conditions have reported neuropsychiatric
symptoms (NPS) months after their illness. The incidence and factors that influence the development of long-
term NPS is unknown. SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers a systemic pro-inflammatory response termed `cytokine
storm', characterized by an uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory molecules. The consequences of
uncontrolled systemic inflammation on the brain and the link to long-term NPS after COVID-19 is unknown.
Sex differences in the outcome from COVID-19 are increasingly evident. Men have worse outcomes with
acute COVID-19 infection, with higher hospitalization rates and mortality, an effect seen globally. Sex
differences in the immune
literature
acute
inflammatory
circulating
immune
responses underlie the differences i n the acute disease course, as seen both in t he
and in our preliminary data. We have found that men have a more robust innate immune response to
COVID-19 infection, with increased circulating neutrophils and monocytes and higher serum levels of
cytokines and markers of brain injury (neuron specific enolase). In contrast, women have more
T and B cells in response to acute infection compared to men, hallmarks of an antigen-specific
response.Interestingly, our preliminary data suggest that women however, may be disproportionally
affected by the chronic effects of infection, including higher rates of NPS. To examine the mechanism of NPS,
we propose a longitudinal, prospective study to assess the impact of acute and chronic inflammation on
markers of brain injury, and long-term NPS for up to 2 years after COVID-19 infection. To accomplish this, we
will leverage our prospective clinical biorepository and long-term COVID-19 follow-up clinic. To date, over 400
hospitalized COVID-19 patients from three different hospitals have been enrolled into a prospective
biorepository and Houston is now at the verge of another surge. Identifying patients at risk for developing
chronic consequences of COVID-19 infection, and discovering potential underlying mechanisms leading to
NPS will be critical to the enhance the health of millions of COVID-19 survivors."
10789937,"The corticospinal tract (CST) is a critical circuit underlying skilled voluntary movements. Damage to this circuit
during development can cause permanent, long-term movement disability in humans. Recognizing and treating
such developmental CST damage is challenging, largely because immediately after the lesion, there are limited
or almost no functional deficits. However, early recognition and intervention with the appropriate treatment
measures is key to reducing long-term disability. The use of preclinical mouse models, which have otherwise
proven to be highly useful in functional investigations of nervous system development, has been limited in this
regard. Since the CST is known to control skilled movements, established behavioral tests in mice that
investigate CST function require training mice in skilled tasks. This precludes their application in neonatal mice.
Further, mouse models used to investigate developmental CST damage, e.g. neonatal hypoxia or spinal injuries,
do not only damage the CST; rather they disrupt multiple neural pathways. It therefore remains completely
unknown whether the CST contributes only to skilled movements in adult mice, or whether it also contributes to
the development of natural, innate motor ability during development, beginning in neonatal mice. This latter
possibility would suggest that there are early, albeit subtle, behavioral correlates of developmental CST injury in
mice. We recently developed a new microsurgical approach to specifically disrupt the developing CST in
neonatal mice. In addition, we have also established the use of Motion Sequencing (MoSeq), a new machine
learning and artificial intelligence platform, to longitudinally investigate the development of natural movements
in neonatal mice. Our preliminary results using MoSeq suggest that developmental damage to the CST results
in specific changes to movement structures in mice, as early as P12; these extend into maturity at P35. Further,
analysis of these P35 mice using conventional metrics of locomotion such as the Catwalk, did not identify any
deficits, highlighting the sensitivity of MoSeq in identifying changes in mouse movements. This proposal
investigates the hypothesis that the CST controls development of natural mouse movements, and not only skilled
movements at maturity. We will use MoSeq to analyze Fezf2 knock out (Fezf2 KO) mice in which the CST is
never established during development (Aim1), as well as mice that undergo microsurgical lesions to disrupt
spinal connectivity of the CST at distinct developmental times (Aim2). Together, our work will identify novel
functional readouts of developmental damage to the CST using natural mouse movements. This new unbiased
quantitative approach toward investigating the earliest behavioral signs of corticospinal dysfunction in mice which
will have eventual application in investigations of descending circuits of motor control, as well as multiple
preclinical models of developmental damage such as neonatal hypoxia or spinal injuries."
11124961,"Cancer cachexia (CC) is a systemic, metabolic wasting syndrome featuring body weight loss due to skeletal muscle and adipose tissue wasting. CC is suffered by ~80% of cancer patients that causes reduced performance status, intolerance to chemotherapy, and increased mortality. This debilitating condition is poorly understood and has no effective treatment. If CC therapy existed, it would improve treatment responses, increase quality of life, and prolong survival. With 50 years of study, the field has focused on defining pathways that promote atrophy in the end-organs most affected my cachexia. While this work has been fruitful, it has not led to identification of the upstream mediators of CC, nor has it generated effective therapies. There is an urgent need for high-quality discovery science and more detailed clinical phenotyping.We have created a virtual institute comprised of diverse, international, multidisciplinary scientists and clinicians with expertise in cancer, metabolism, neuroendocrine function, immunology, human metabolic diseases, preclinical models, and clinical phenotyping. We hypothesize that CC is driven by tumor-intrinsic factors that activate neurohormonal sickness pathways, which then induce anorexia, metabolic dysfunction, and tissue atrophy."
10893993,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Preterm birth and intrauterine growth restriction are significant public health problems in the United States,
affecting 10% and 3-9% of births, respectively. These adverse pregnancy outcomes result in increased risk of
mortality and lifelong morbidities, in addition to substantial monetary costs of >$26 billion annually.
Intrauterine/placental inflammation contributes to more than half of preterm birth. Much of the research related
to placental inflammation has focused on acute inflammatory processes, which are typically driven by bacterial
infections in the amniotic cavity, and little is known about the triggers or mechanisms that initiate and sustain
chronic placental inflammation (CPI). It is well known that some CPI is associated with viral infection, such as
cytomegalovirus, but in most cases, the etiology of CPI remains unknown. We hypothesize that most CPI is a
chronic inflammatory reaction to viral infection in the placenta. We will comprehensively analyze placental tissue
from pregnant women to determine whether viruses and antiviral inflammatory profiles are associated with CPI.
Furthermore, we will test maternal blood collected during pregnancy to determine whether we can identify a viral
and/or host signal that will predict development of CPI. Lastly, we will test neonatal umbilical cord blood for the
presence of viral infection or host signal consistent with that seen in the placenta or maternal blood. This study
has the potential to lead to the development of a predictive or diagnostic test for CPI, and it will help us to
understand how CPI is triggered and progresses so that we may ultimately be able to design a preventative or
therapeutic treatment. Ultimately, our ability to predict and/or prevent CPI will improve pregnancy outcomes and
child health."
10887467,"Studies of the immune system over the last hundred+ years have demonstrated its critical importance to
defense against pathogens and toxins; its role in asthma, allergy and autoimmunity; and more recently how it
can be harnessed in the treatment of cancer. The routine appearance of viral, bacterial, and parasitic
outbreaks all point to the need for the development of new or better immune-based vaccines and a need for
better understanding of how the immune system controls or contributes to disease. Likewise, recent work in
Immunology has increased our understanding of how the microbiome can contribute to or regulate
autoimmune as well as infectious disease, how immunoparalysis alters long-term outcomes after sepsis and
other diseases, and how manipulation of immune checkpoints can boost the immune response. Collectively
these and other immune based studies have had a major impact on human health and led to the discovery of
new therapies and vaccines. Thus, in order to continue recent advancements, discover new therapies, prepare
for future pathogen outbreaks, and educate both medical professionals as well as the public, there is a distinct
need to continue to train the next generation of immunologists. The overall goal of the University of Iowa
Predoctoral Training Program in Immunology is to educate, train, and produce a new generation of excellent
young immunologists, well-prepared to advance the science of immunology and their own independent careers
in academic, educational, and industrial settings. This is a competitive renewal application for years 26-30 of a
training program supporting students pursuing doctoral studies in basic and translational immunology at The
University of Iowa. Thirty-one training faculty members provide intensive laboratory research training and
effective, relevant classroom instruction leading to the Ph.D. or the combined M.D. Ph.D. degree in
Immunology. The diversity of faculty research expertise within the discipline of immunology is a strength of the
training opportunities provided, and is complemented by a network of frequent and successful collaborations in
funding, publication, and student training. We continue to revise and optimize our Program to best meet the
needs of trainee scientific careers and the diverse scientific workforce of the future. This program fills a critical
need to support our continuing efforts in training predoctoral students from diverse backgrounds for
independent careers as immunologists."

The corneal epithelium is a rapidly self-renewing epithelial surface essential for maintaining a clear cornea and
normal vision. The limbus contains a small subpopulation of limbal stem cells (LSCs) that continually
repopulate the corneal epithelium and patients with limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD) are unable to
regenerate the corneal epithelium, resulting in ""conjunctivalization"" that ultimately leads to blindness. We
previously identified that the ABCB5 gene is expressed by LSCs in both mouse and human tissues and that
normal function of ABCB5+ LSCs is required for corneal development, homeostasis, and repair. Moreover,
ABCB5 is a cell surface protein and specific monoclonal antibodies are capable of isolating pure ABCB5+
LSCs for study and transplantation. Research from our prior grants supported the first clinical trials using
purified in vitro-expanded human allogeneic ABCB5+ LSCs for patients with bilateral LSCD (ClinicalTrials.gov:
Identifier NCT03549299). Despite our success, the use of donor allogeneic ABCB5+ LSC transplants is
suboptimal because it requires immunosuppressive treatment to prevent immune rejection of donor cells.
Allogeneic donor ABCB5+ LSCs were used because LSCD patients lack a source of healthy autologous
ABCB5+ LSCs since both eyes are involved. To solve this problem and to treat bilateral LSCD patients with
autologous ABCB5+ LSCs, this grant renewal will study three novel approaches. The first approach uses
transplantation of ABCB5+ iLSCs (induced LSCs derived from iPSCs generated from skin) using full
reprogramming of autologous skin cells, using the Yamanaka genes OSKM (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc) to
produce human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that are then differentiated in vitro into 2D eye-like
organoids that remarkably contain ABCB5+ LSCs (Watanabe et al., iScience, 2021). The second approach
uses transplantation-independent restoration and expansion of residual dysfunctional or quantity-deficient
LSCs, using in vivo partial epigenetic reprogramming, a new form of reprogramming discovered by Co-PI
Dr. Bruce Ksander and collaborators (Lu et al., Nature, 2020), which uses transient expression of three
Yamanaka genes, OSK, to restore and rescue injured dysfunctional cells in vivo. The third approach uses
niche-produced LAMA5 ligand-based signaling activation of the BCAM molecular pathway that we just
discovered is critical to ABCB5+ LSC and Transient Amplifying Cell (TAC) expansion (Sasamoto et al. Cell
Reports, 2022, in press), with resultant stem cell proliferation programs that enhance corneal regeneration.
Thus, our hypothesis is that it is possible to manufacture and expand autologous ABCB5+ LSCs from patients
with bilateral LSCD using (i) full reprogramming in vitro, (ii) partial epigenetic reprogramming in vivo, and (iii)
niche-produced LAMA5 ligand-based activation of LSCs through specific BCAM/ABCB5 signal transduction
pathways. These autologous ABCB5+ LSC will fully regenerate and maintain a normal limbus and corneal
epithelium. This hypothesis will be tested in three independent specific aims that are thematically related."
10797018,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Sporadic inclusion body myositis (IBM) is a rare, acquired muscle disease of unknown etiology. Our long-term
goal is to define how T cells contribute to the pathogenesis of IBM. T cells undergo clonal expansion and
differentiation but lose their proliferative capacity and exhibit characteristics of senescence, including production
of cytolytic proteins (e.g. perforin and granzyme) that promote muscle cell death. Further, senescent T cells are
resistance to apoptosis, which may explain the treatment refractory nature of IBM. The objective of the current
study is to define molecular attributes of senescence in highly-differentiated T cells, and correlate these features
with clinical measures of IBM. Further, a pharmacological approach will be used to define the mechanism
regulating T cell senescence in IBM. We will test the central hypothesis that senescent muscle T cells promote
the severity and progression of IBM. In preliminary studies, we show that the frequency of KRLG1+CD8+
senescent-like T cells was elevated in the blood of IBM patients. Although KRLG1+CD8+ T cells correlated with
disease duration, they did not correlate with the severity of IBM. Given that an immune response can vastly differ
between blood and the affected tissue, mechanistic studies with high-resolution profiling of the immune response
in IBM muscle are needed to determine relationships between senescent T cells and IBM. The central hypothesis
of this investigation will be tested by addressing two specific aims. In specific aim 1, we will define the molecular
features of senescent muscle T cells and their relationship to disease severity and progression. The lack of tools
to rigorously phenotype T cell populations in muscle has made it difficult to study these cells and determine their
function in IBM. Thus, an innovative high-dimensional mass imaging platform will be used to address this
limitation, and determine the relationship between senescent T cells and IBM. In specific aim 2, we will
determine the ability of senolytic therapy to ablate senescent CD8+ T cells, which will provide mechanistic insight
on the regulation of T cell senescence during IBM. The proposed study is significant as it will establish a
foundation for defining the function of dysregulated T cell responses in IBM. Further, it will provide preliminary
evidence to support the testing of a novel therapeutic approach for this disease. The proposed research is
also innovative as it uses cutting-edge advancements in mass imaging to rigorously interrogate the senescent
phenotype of T cells in IBM. The use of senolytic drugs also marks an innovative approach for targeting
dysfunctional T cells and defining the role of senescent T cells in IBM. Collectively, the proposed work promises
to advance our understanding of the role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of IBM, and may have a
broad impact by guiding the development of novel strategies to treat and/or cure IBM."
10892971,"PROJECT SUMMARY
All coronaviruses including Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), SARS, MERS SARS-CoV-2 and Porcine Epidemic
Diarrhea Virus (PEDV), are assembled from multiple protein components. All of these coronaviruses utilize a
glycosylated M protein as the nidus for assembly of viruses within infected cells. While many coronavirus
infections have been linked to severe lung disease, they also cause a range of gastrointestinal abnormalities,
especially diarrhea. Through a yeast two-hybrid screen, we have identified the interaction of the cytoplasmic
tail of the MHV M protein with Myosin Vb (MYO5B). Over the past 20 years, we have studied the regulation of
the apical membrane recycling system by Rab11a and its associated interacting proteins MYO5B and the
Rab11 Family Interacting Proteins (Rab11-FIPs). We have previously demonstrated that MYO5B can interact
with multiple Rab small GTPases, including Rab11a, Rab11b, Rab25, Rab8a and Rab10. MHV M protein
interacts with an alternatively spliced exon in MYO5B (Exon D), which codes for a sequence that we have
previously shown to bind Rab10. MYO5B+D co-localizes with MHV M protein, Rab10 and Rab11a, when co-
expressed in polarized epithelial cells. MYO5B+D also co-localized with co-expressed M proteins from PEDV,
MERS and SARS-CoV-2. MYO5B lacking Exon D (MYO5B-D) did not localize with coronavirus M proteins. A
random mutagenesis of the MHV M cytoplasmic tail identified point mutations that abrogate interactions with
MYO5B Exon D. One these mutations, MHV M(E121K), has previously been reported to block viral assembly.
All of these findings have led us to hypothesize that the association of coronavirus M proteins with MYO5B+D
is a critical step in M protein trafficking through the apical recycling system and virus assembly. To evaluate
this hypothesis, we will pursue 3 specific aims: First, we will define the structural basis of MYO5B exon D
association with M proteins and Rab10. We will utilize yeast 2-hybrid screening to define residues in Exon D
that are responsible for binding of MHV M versus Rab10. Additionally, we will use split-ubiquitin yeast two-
hybrid screening to evaluate association of other coronavirus M proteins with MYO5B Exon D. Second, we will
determine the association of coronavirus M proteins with elements of the recycling system. We will utilize
differentiated human intestinal enteroids to examine the trafficking pathway utilized by MHV M and other
coronavirus M proteins through the plasma membrane recycling system. We will examine MHV and
coronavirus virus like particle assembly in polarized epithelial cells. Third, we will target M protein interaction
with MHV M proteins by testing the ability of expression of the minimal binding MYO5B Exons ABCDE domain
to disrupt interactions between M proteins and full length MYO5B+D. Additionally, we will perform a small
molecule screen to identify compounds that can disrupt the interaction of MHV M cytosolic tail and
MYO5B(ABCDE). These studies will establish common pathways for disrupting coronavirus assembly in
polarized epithelial cells."

Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease that
affects nearly 5 millions of people around the world. PD is associated with intracellular
aggregation of α-synuclein (α-Syn), a small protein that is involved in the regulation of lipid
metabolism and synaptic vesicle trafficking. A growing body of evidence suggests that
alterations in lipid profile, which were observed in both brain and plasma, can be directly
linked to the onset of α-Syn aggregation. We hypothesize that the toxicity of α-Syn
aggregates is determined by their structure, which in turn is controlled by the lipid
composition of neuronal membranes. Our group pioneered development of a label-free,
non-invasive and non-destructive approach that can be used to determine the structural
organization of individual α-Syn aggregates. We will use this innovative biophysical
imaging approach to unravel protein secondary structure of α-Syn oligomers grown in the
presence of different lipids. We will investigate toxicity of these oligomers on primary
dopaminergic neurons from midbrain, striatal, and cortical areas of the mouse brains. This
will reveal the relationship between the structure of α-Syn oligomers and their toxicity. The
proposed work also aims to determine the extent to which α-Syn oligomers with different
structures exert toxic effects to the specific subsets of neurons."

The massive global pandemic with high morbidity and mortality makes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) one of the deadliest viruses in recent history. It is especially noteworthy for
hijacking the normal operations of human cells. To develop effective therapies, we need a better understanding
of the mechanisms that permit the virus to invade cells and evade host immune restriction. SARS-CoV-2 encodes
the non-structural protein (nsp)16/nsp10 protein complex that transfers a methyl group from S-adenosyl
methionine (SAM) to 2’-OH of the first transcribing nucleotide of the viral mRNA and thus converts the Cap-0
(m7GpppA) to Cap-1 (m7GpppAm). The resulting viral mRNA mimics host cell’s mRNA. In this way, a cell cannot
distinguish between its own RNA and that of the virus. This modification of the virally encoded mRNA not only
tricks the immune system and helps the virus to take over the host translation machinery for synthesis of its own
proteins for survival and propagation. Ablation of nsp16 activity should trigger an immune response to viral
infection and limit pathogenesis. Our recent paper in Nature Communications described atomic level details of
the nsp16/nsp10 complex and how the enzyme is well adapted to bind the RNA cap and exert the 2’-OH
methylation. We also discovered a distant pocket (located 25Å away from the catalytic center) in nsp16 that is
unique to SARS-CoV-2. We also found that this pocket in nsp16 is partially composed of amino acids that are
unique to SARS-CoV-2. It can bind small molecules outside of the catalytic center. We propose to build a long-
term research program aimed at deciphering the factors crucial to the maintenance of RNA genome and evasion
from the host’s immune response. Our studies will reveal basic principles underlying SARS-CoV-2 RNA cap
modification, the mode of nucleoprotein (NP) assembly, interplay with mRNA, and new approaches for
therapeutic targeting. In Aim 1, we will resolve a series of new structures of nsp16/nsp10 proteins captured in
every step of the methyl transfer by X-ray crystallography. The structural data will be validated by detailed
biochemical and biophysical studies. We will resolve the biochemical and structural determinants of the assembly
of viral RNA capping machinery, and identify factors underlying integrity of RNA genome. In Aim 2, we will
develop a novel molecular tool to study temporal distribution of the RNA methylation during viral infection. We
will examine new models for combinatorial inhibition of viral proteins by drug repurposing or novel small
molecules. Finally, we will use our recently established reverse genetics approaches based on the use of a
bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) to generate recombinant (r)SARS-CoV2 containing mutations in nsp16 to
determine their contribution in viral replication in cultured cells and pathogenesis in vivo using our recently
described K18 human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and
associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)."

Automated messaging has significant potential to extend access to guidance and support for those managing
common mental health conditions like depression. However, benefits of automated messaging could be
improved through building capacity to automatically adapt messaging approaches to users’ needs. The PI’s
career goal is to establish scalable digital mental health interventions that deliver individualized communication
to maximize users’ engagement in effectively managing mental health concerns. This proposal outlines training
and research plans to achieve this goal, culminating in a successful R01 proposal. The training plan takes full
advantage of the strong institutional support and environment at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of
Medicine and the Center for Behavioral Intervention Technologies, which is led by the primary mentor for this
proposal. Training goals necessary to the PI’s career goal include growth in (1) user-centered design, (2)
adaptive interventions, and (3) clinical science methodologies. This proposal builds on the PI’s background in
communication science, which has focused on effective message design and social support provision. In this
K01, the PI will aim to develop a model for delivering automated, individualized self-management support for
depression, emphasizing messaging that can accommodate fluctuations in users’ motivations and abilities to
carry out cognitive and behavioral self-management strategies. This will be achieved through the following
specific aims: (1) conduct user-centered design activities and usability testing to design and refine a
messaging system; (2) integrate a reinforcement learning algorithm into the system that adapts content to
users and their contexts; and (3) pilot procedures and analyses for a randomized controlled trial and obtain
preliminary evidence of the intervention’s effectiveness and mechanisms of action. For Aim 3, I will test
hypotheses that messaging interventions will result in greater reduction in depression than a waitlist control
group, and that adaptive messaging will reduce depression relative to non-adaptive messaging by producing
greater engagement in self-management. This research is expected to advance the design of messaging
interventions for depression, ultimately extending the reach and effectiveness of these interventions. Skills
acquired by carrying out the research proposed in this application will allow the PI to successfully compete for
R01 funding in order to conduct a larger effectiveness trial."
10923868,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
 A foundational component of this P30 application is the Personalized Clinical Core, which will be the
primary source of human cells, tissues, biofluids [e.g.: sweat, serum, sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
(BALF),] and translational research expertise. The Personalized Clinical Core builds directly on current clinical
research strengths and infrastructure at CCHMC, CSMC and UCCOM including the CFF-TDN program, the
CF-RDP program, investigator-initiated research, and institutional commitments to CF translational research.
The Personalized Clinical Core will expand these capabilities in critical ways, operationalizing novel
translational research projects and providing direct patient relevance to cutting-edge basic science. The long-
term goal of this core is to support basic science CF research with patient-derived samples from the clinic into
the laboratory, and high-quality translational research moving laboratory findings into the clinic. This will be
achieved through three specific aims. Specific Aims 1 and 2 will capitalize on existing partnerships and
infrastructure to obtain, bank, and distribute high-quality gastrointestinal and respiratory samples, respectively,
from CF and non-CF controls, paired with relevant patient data. Specific Aim 3 will provide the tools
necessary to execute cutting-edge translational studies in CF, including expertise and support in novel disease
markers and endpoints.
 Centralizing these capabilities through the Personalized Clinical Core structure will help to drive
research efficiencies and standardization. In addition, the samples obtained and processed through the
Personalized Clinical Core will be available for direct use by CF researchers, and for projects utilizing the
Personalized Model System Core and the CF-Organ-On-a-Chip Core."
10889214,"CORE SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Tolerance of kidney allografts has been achieved in monkeys and patients via transient mixed hematopoietic
chimerism. However, until now, our current mixed chimerism protocols have consistently failed to induce
tolerance of other more immunogenic transplants, including hearts. Enhancing our mixed chimerism strategy to
achieve tolerance of heart allografts is the main objective of our overall Program. We will accomplish this
objective by testing the overall hypothesis that enhancing current mixed chimerism protocols using novel
strategies that achieve durable, high level donor chimerism will lead to an effective and safe tolerance protocol
that can be rapidly translated to human recipients of heart allografts. The specific goal of Core A is to test
mechanistic hypotheses generated by the in vivo treatments described in Projects 1-3. Improving our
mechanistic understanding of tolerance inducing procedures that work and those that do not will inform the
design of future protocols. We will test these mechanistic hypotheses by 1) deciphering the mechanisms by
which donor hematopoietic mixed chimerism, leukocyte recovery, and alloimmunity by memory T cells affect
tolerance induction, 2) determining if successful tolerance protocols are associated with extracellular vesicle
generation and donor antigen cross-dressing, and 3) evaluating the role of T cell deletion and regulation in
rejection vs. tolerance. Understanding the mechanisms driving the immune response towards rejection or
tolerance in monkeys treated with the mixed chimerism protocols described in Projects 1-3 will contribute greatly
to the refinement of those protocols and to the design of future tolerance strategies that can be tested in Projects
1-3 in anticipation of rapid translation to human heart transplant recipients."
10889225,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The unifying goal of this Program is to design new and innovative strategies that achieve clinically-relevant
heart allograft tolerance in 2-month-delayed tolerance induction protocols which induce either transient or
durable mixed chimerism. The PI of this Program application has recently developed novel protocols that
have, for the first time, achieved long-term, stable tolerance of fully MHC mismatched hearts in cynomolgus
monkeys. This remarkable result was attained in heart recipients by combining a transient mixed chimerism
protocol with donor kidney co-transplantation. Recent pilot studies have demonstrated the feasibility of
replacing the previous requirement for donor kidney co-transplantation with approaches that both inhibit CD8
effector/memory T cells and enhance host regulatory T cells. Project 3 will build on the clinically-applicable
heart tolerance induction platform developed by the Madsen team (2-month D-Protocol; presented in the
Overview and in detail in Project 1) and the Pierson/Azimzadeh lab's extensive experience with dual
costimulation pathway blockade in NHP heart allograft models. We will test whether enhanced costimulation
pathway blockade (αCD2 with αCD154 and/or αCD28) can replace the requirement for renal co-
transplantation while evaluating αCD2 (Aim 1) or inhibition of JAK 1/3 (Aim 2) or Bcl-2 (Aim 3) as alternative
and potentially complementary approaches to deplete or inhibit tolerance-resistent effector memory T cells
(TEM) cells and reduce toxicity (eliminate the need for αCD8 and reduce or eliminate host total body irradiation
(TBI)) in the 2-month D-Protocol. Guided by initial results, we will also deploy TReg-supportive treatments (from
Project 1) and radiation-free conditioning using αCD117-Amanitin antibody drug conjugate (from Project 2)
with αCD2-based enhanced costimulation blockade, aiming to reduce or eliminate the need for radiation and
thereby reduce toxicity. Core A will elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with success
or failure to consistently induce tolerance in the three coordinated but distinct Project 3 Aims, and enable
mechanistically informative comparisons between results from distinct but closely aligned Aims in Projects 1
and 2. We anticipate that one or more Aims in Project 3 will generate innovative, effective, and safe tolerance
protocols that will be ready for clinical trials in heart recipients by the end of the funding period, and enhance
our understanding of tolerance induction in a clinically relevant context."
10840943,"Our long-term overall goals are to discover physiologic homeostatic mechanisms underlying regulation of
CaV1.2 channels in the heart and to identify novel therapeutic targets for heart failure and arrhythmias. CaV1.2,
the L-type Ca2+ channel that plays a key role in cardiac excitation-contraction coupling, is an important target of
the sympathetic nervous system and several signaling pathways. Increased cardiac contractility during fight-or-
flight response is caused by β-adrenergic augmentation of CaV1.2 channels. In transgenic murine hearts
expressing fully PKA phosphorylation-site-deficient mutant CaV1.2 α1C and β subunits, this regulation persists,
implying involvement of extra-channel factors. Recently, we identified the mechanism by which β-adrenergic
agonists stimulate voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. We expressed α1C or β2B subunits conjugated to ascorbate-
peroxidase in mouse hearts and used multiplexed, quantitative proteomics to track hundreds of proteins in
close proximity to CaV1.2. We observed that the Ca2+ channel inhibitor Rad, a monomeric G-protein, is
enriched in the CaV1.2 micro-environment but is depleted during β-adrenergic stimulation. PKA-catalyzed
phosphorylation of specific Ser residues on Rad decreases its affinity for auxiliary β-subunits and relieves
constitutive inhibition of CaV1.2 observed as an increase in channel open probability. We propose three Aims:
(1) Using knock-in mice with the four PKA phosphorylation sites of Rad mutated to alanine, and mice with
cardiac-specific expression of a mutant CaVβ subunit that cannot bind Rad, we will determine in
cardiomyocytes the role of Rad phosphorylation in regulating cardiac contractility in vivo. (2) Having
successfully applied proximity labeling, we now also propose to identify the A-kinase anchoring proteins
(AKAPs) that facilitate β-adrenergic regulation of CaV1.2 in cardiomyocytes. The identity of the AKAP that
facilitates β-adrenergic regulation of CaV1.2 in cardiomyocytes is unknown. (3) PKG activation by cGMP
inhibits CaV1.2 and counteracts β-adrenergic stimulation of Ca2+ current in cardiomyocytes. Strategic PKG
activation could therefore serve as a targeted suppressor of adrenergic stimulation of CaV1.2 and concomitant
arrhythmias. We hypothesize that PKG signaling blocks β-adrenergic-induced stimulation of CaV1.2 by at least
one of several mechanisms: i) by direct PKG phosphorylation of α1C or β2B; ii) by preventing the recruitment of
PKA to the CaV1.2 complex; iii) by preventing the dissociation of Rad from the CaV1.2 complex in the heart. To
assess whether PKG phosphorylation of α1C or β2B is required, we will utilize our fully phospho-mutant α1C and
β2B transgenic mice that have normal β-adrenergic stimulation of CaV1.2. To dissect the upstream signaling
pathways, we will utilize proximity proteomics. The three Aims, which will provide key new understandings
concerning the regulation of Ca2+ influx in cardiomyocytes, are highly relevant towards understanding the
molecular mechanisms responsible for the modulation of cardiac contractility and arrhythmogenesis."

This GUDMAP Atlas project is focused on the lower urinary tract (LUT; bladder and urethra) of male and
female mice. The Specific Aims are to build 3D multiscale anatomical atlases of (1) the mouse LUT
vasculature and (2) the autonomic and sensory innervation of this vasculature. Times of the life cycle from
embryo to adult have been selected to reveal the impact of major changes in organ structure and function
on vascular patterning. The outcomes of Aim 1 will fill a major gap in GUDMAP and the broader literature,
where LUT vascular structures have been under-explored in comparison with LUT muscle wall and
epithelium. The outcomes of Aim 2 will provide a second important dimension to GUDMAP and the
literature, by superimposing on the vascular atlases the closely associated axonal plexuses (sensory and
autonomic) that regulate LUT vascular function. Most of these axon classes do not originate from pelvic
ganglia, so provide to the GUDMAP database new resources that are quite distinct from the existing
knowledge base. In addition to developing new knowledge on the vascular system, the outcomes of the
project will support generation of new hypotheses on LUT function in health and disease.

Data from our mouse model of Botulinum Toxin A (BTxA) induced muscle paralysis has revealed that
neuromuscular function, outside the axis of mechanical loading deficits, is a critical modulator of bone
homeostasis. Consistent with this thesis, we have observed that transient muscle paralysis triggers acute
inflammatory signaling within bone marrow that precedes the onset of focal RANKL-mediated
osteoclastogenesis, which is responsible for the profound cortical and trabecular bone resorption observed in
the model. However, the intercellular signaling that initiates acute bone marrow inflammation and subsequent
bone resorption has not been elucidated and therefore presents a barrier to identifying translational strategies
that would decouple neuromuscular dysfunction from bone loss. One potential initiator of this rapid response is
neurogenic inflammation, which is triggered by neuropeptide release from sensory nerves and is amplified by
mast cell mediated histamine release. We therefore pursued a series of preliminary studies to assess
activation of this pathway following muscle paralysis and found that: 1) Substance P, a classic initiator of
neurogenic inflammation, was upregulated in tibia bone marrow within 1 d of calf paralysis, 2) genes
associated with connective tissue mast cell activation were acutely elevated following muscle paralysis, and 3)
muscle paralysis induced bone resorption was significantly diminished in mast cell deficient KitW-sh/W-sh mice.
We therefore hypothesize that: Bone resorption following muscle paralysis is initiated by neuropeptide
signaling and is amplified by mast cell dependent histamine release. We will pursue this thesis via four
complementary Specific Aims (SA), each with a corresponding sub-hypothesis. First, we anticipate that
neuropeptides within bone marrow will be elevated by BTxA induced muscle paralysis prior to evidence of
mast cell activation or bone resorption (SA#1). SA#2 will then demonstrate that successful antagonism of
these neuropeptides will be required to inhibit mast cell activation and bone resorption induced by muscle
paralysis. In SA#3, we will leverage a cKit independent, connective tissue mast cell deficient mouse to
demonstrate that mast cell mediated histamine signaling is responsible for the profound osteoclastogenesis
induced by muscle paralysis. SA#4 will then provide proof of concept that treatment with histamine receptor
antagonists will significantly attenuate bone resorption caused by muscle paralysis. Each aspect of the
proposed signaling pathway (neurogenic inflammation, neuropeptide signaling, mast cell activation, paralysis
induced bone resorption) has been explored in other contexts but has not been integrated into a cellular
signaling cascade that integrates muscle, nerve, and bone physiology. Importantly, if our thesis is supported,
the broad clinical experience with histamine antagonists will enable repurposing of approved drugs toward the
goal of ameliorating acute bone resorption precipitated by paralysis or other neuromuscular impairments."

Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that kill tumor and virus-infected cells, independently of peptide
antigens. NK cells recognize target cells through activating and inhibitory NK receptors, which interact with
specific ligands on the target cell surface. The balance of activating and inhibitory receptor signaling determines
whether target cells are killed. Our lab recently found that the most conserved and universally expressed NK
activating receptor, NKp46, recognizes cells undergoing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by binding to
externalized calreticulin (ecto-CRT), an ER chaperone that translocates to the cell surface under conditions of
ER stress. Ecto-CRT binds to and activates NKp46, leading to killing of tumor, senescent, and Zika virus (ZIKV)-
infected cells. We also found that ER stress during ZIKV infection downregulates the major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) ligands of NK inhibitory receptors. Coronavirus (CoV) replication is tightly linked to the ER. CoV
mature by budding into the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), where the nucleocapsid-genomic RNA
complex is enclosed within a membrane containing the membrane-bound structural viral proteins, S, E, and M.
These proteins are expressed on the ER. Massive production of viral proteins along with depletion of the ERGIC
membrane by budding and egress of progeny virions disrupts the ER during CoV infection, as shown using
murine hepatitis virus as a model system. Given our previous work showing recognition of ZIKV-infected and ER
stressed cells via NKp46/ecto-calreticulin, we wondered whether CoV-infected cells may also be recognized by
NK via the same interaction. Most papers studying NK responses to SARS-CoV-2 have focused on antibody-
dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and are thus measuring a function of NK cells that depends on an
adaptive immune response. Three papers investigated antibody-independent NK cell interactions with SARS-
CoV-2-infected target cells in vitro, and suggest that NK cell co-culture with infected targets suppresses viral
replication by measuring a reduction in viral protein or RNA. However, none of these publications explored how
NK recognize infected cells. In preliminary experiments I assayed for ER stress and CRT externalization during
infection by the avirulent human CoV OC43. My preliminary data confirm that OC43 infection induces
upregulation of ER stress genes and show that CRT externalization occurs during infection. Based on these
data, I hypothesize that CoV replication causes ER stress, externalization of CRT, and downregulation of NK
inhibitory receptor ligands, causing CoV-infected cells to be recognized by NKp46 and killed by NK. I will
investigate this central hypothesis by measuring expression of activating ecto-CRT and inhibitory MHC ligands
on the surface of CoV-infected cells (Aim 1). I will then test the ability of primary and NK cell lines to kill CoV-
infected cells and determine whether the killing of infected cells, if present, is mediated by the NKp46/ecto-CRT
interaction (Aim 2). I will investigate this system using both avirulent OC43 and virulent SARS-CoV-2. The
proposal will further our understanding of how the innate immune system may defend against CoV infection."

 More than 1.8 million cases of Chlamydia trachomatis infections are reported to the
CDC each year, making it the most commonly reported infectious disease in the country.
This pathogen is an obligate intracellular bacterium that can only reproduce in human
cells. As a result of this dependence on a host cell, Chlamydia has undergone reductive
evolution and has one of the smallest of bacterial genomes. Many of the remaining
genes, including Chlamydia-specific genes, are essential genes whose functions have
not been elucidated because of the limitations of current genetic methods. To study
chlamydial gene function, we are developing a novel protein depletion method that
exploits the ability of small RNAs (sRNAs) to downregulate expression of specific target
proteins. In proof-of-principle experiments, we have shown that we can inducibly
knockdown protein levels for two chlamydial proteins, IncA and IncG. In Aim 1, we will
knockdown additional C. trachomatis genes, including non-essential and essential
genes. In Aim 2, we will compare this sRNA knockdown method to another protein
depletion method, CRISPRi. We will compare the ability of each method to control the
level and timing of knockdown and will investigate whether they cause polar effects on
genes within the same operon. Successful completion of these studies will lead to an
innovative genetic approach for selectively depleting a Chlamydia protein. This new tool
for studying chlamydial gene function will have a sustained impact on the field."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD) such as Lewy body dementia (LBD) are all
associated with deposition of misfolded protein aggregates in the brain including tau in AD and non-AD
tauopathies, and α-synuclein (αSyn) in LBD. Currently, a definite diagnosis of these disorders relies on the
histological and biochemical examination of the brain for the misfolded proteins. Development of reliable and
sensitive assays for these misfolded proteins in easily accessible peripheral specimens is critical for early or
differential diagnosis, determination of disease severity, and evaluation of therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials.
Interestingly, brain tau and αSyn aggregates exhibit prion-like aggregation seeding activity, which can be
specifically detected by two highly sensitive amplification assays including real-time quaking-induced conversion
(RT-QuIC) and protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA). They have been proved to be highly sensitive for
detection of misfolded proteins in the brain and/or cerebrospinal fluid in prion disease (PrD), AD, or PD (Atarashi
et al., 2011; Peden et al., 2012; Foutz et al., 2017; Orrú et al., 2015; Saijo et al., 2017; Kraus et al., 2018). Using
RT-QuIC/PMCA, we were able to detect prion and αSyn aggregates in the skin of individuals with PrD or PD
(Orrú et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019; 2020). Remarkably, our preliminary results have shown that prions-like tau-
seeding activity is detectable by RT-QuIC and PMCA in skin of AD patients but not in normal controls. Thus, we
hypothesize that skin tau-seeding activity detected by RT-QuIC and PMCA is a novel biomarker for
diagnosing, characterizing, and predicting outcomes of AD and non-AD tauopathies and for
differentiating AD from LBD. To test this hypothesis, the following four Aims will be pursued: (1) Establish the
tau-seeding activity in autopsied skin samples as a biomarker for POSTMORTEM diagnosis and characterization
of AD using RT-QuIC/PMCA assays; (2) Assess skin tau-seeding activity as a biomarker for PREMORTEM
diagnosis, characterization, and predicting clinical outcomes of AD; (3) Determine skin tau-seeding activity as a
biomarker for differentiating AD from non-AD tauopathies, and from LBD, a common ADRD; and (4) Determine
whether skin tau-seeding activity is detectable at an asymptomatic stage by RT-QuIC/PMCA in animal models
of AD tauopathies. We believe that the successful implementation of this project will develop RT-QuIC/PMCA
assays of skin tau-seeding activity as a biomarker for diagnostic testing and evaluating clinical trials across AD,
non-AD tauopathies, and LBD."

Much of cancer immunotherapy is focused on engineering or activating tumor-antigen specific CD8+ T cells and,
to a lesser extent, CD4+ T cells. In particular, neoantigen-specific T cells are attractive because they can kill
cancer cells with high specificity. 1 A general approach starts with identifying T cells that recognize neoantigens
broadly expressed within the tumor, isolating the T cells and determining their T cell receptor (TCR) sequences.
These TCRs can then be transfected into patient T cells, perhaps with additional genetic engineering2 to promote
more durable anti-tumor effects, and expanded into an infusion product for patient treatment. 3 In fact, this
approach has recently entered the clinic, with one trial (NCT03970382) drawing from inventions from an NCI-
funded CCNE U54 grant led by the PI of this proposal. 4,5 However, there are still a number of fundamental and
technological challenges associated with advancing neoantigen-specific TCR-engineered therapies. First, the
discovery of neoantigen-specific TCRs relies on guidance from algorithms, such as NET MHCpan 4.1, to predict
antigen/MHC presentation (based upon binding and other considerations), and many neoantigens arising from
truncal mutations, such as mutant KRAS or mutant TP53, are predicted as unlikely, yet have been reported as
clinically effective targets. 6,7,8 Second, neoantigen-specific CD4+ T cells and their class II restricted neoantigens,
while identified as important for immunotherapy-induced anti-tumor responses, 9,10 remain a largely untapped
therapeutic resource, with prediction algorithms 11,12 for Class II antigen/MHC binding less developed. A third
challenge is that analysis of a patient blood for neoantigen-specific T cells typically requires upwards of 20M
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and so isn't particularly efficient. Here we propose 3 specific Aims
designed to address these outstanding issues. At the heart of the technology solutions are combinations of
engineered nanoparticles (NPs) and biomolecular engineered constructs designed for efficient and selective
capture, analysis, and validation of truncal neoantigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations. Significant
preliminary data is presented for all 3 Aims, some of which uses COVID-19 patient data generated by our work
during the current pandemic. 13,14 The result of this work will be a powerful toolset designed for a minimally-biased
search for CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations against truncal neoantigens (independent of patient HLA
haplotype), a toolset designed for the rapid validation and characterization of those neoantigen-specific T cell
clonotypes, and a public data base of Class I and Class II truncal neoantigens and T cell receptor genes specific
to those neoantigens."

 Primary microcephaly is a structural birth defect characterized by a significantly smaller head
circumference than the mean of age and gender at birth. It is mainly linked to dysfunction of the neural progenitor
cell population, resulting in reduced neurons in the cerebral cortex. Most microcephaly-causing genes are
involved in mitosis and cytokinesis; however, recently, defects in secretory protein trafficking have been
implicated in causing microcephaly. One of the newly identified genes that are potentially involved in protein
trafficking is IER3IP1. Bi-allelic variants of IER3IP1 have been reported to cause a rare, pediatric,
neurodevelopmental condition called microcephaly with simplified gyration, generalized epilepsy, and permanent
neonatal diabetes syndrome (MEDS). MEDS patients present with severe congenital structural brain
abnormalities, including microcephaly, ventriculomegaly, and cerebral atrophy. Prior studies on IER3IP1 suggest
that its function is involved in ER to the Golgi trafficking in humans. I confirmed that the pathogenic variant blocks
ER to Golgi trafficking with a GFP trafficking reporter, and the correction of IER3IP1 mutation through
CRISPR/Cas9 restored the trafficking efficiency. Herein, I propose to focus on elucidating the function of IER3IP1
in neurogenesis and human brain development to understand how faulty protein trafficking leads to brain birth
defects.
 I hypothesize that IER3IP1 regulates secretory protein trafficking during neurogenesis. I have
successfully generated and characterized cortical brain organoids and 2D neuronal culture derived from MEDS
patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells and isogenic control cells to test this. Using these MEDS patient
cell models, I will complete the following aims: Aim 1. What is the underlying cellular mechanism of microcephaly
seen in MEDS patients with IER3IP1 p.L78P mutation? and Aim 2. Does IER3IP1 regulate the molecular
trafficking of membrane receptors important in neurodevelopment? This proposal will fill the gap in our
understanding of how protein trafficking regulates neurogenesis and provide insight into how abnormal protein
trafficking leads to structural brain abnormalities."

Cognitive disorders pose a major threat to public health, and represent an enormous economic and social
burden. Despite the high incidence of these disorders, effective treatments remain severely limited. Thus, the
development of novel therapeutic to treat cognitive disorders is an important goal. Here we focus on the
integrated stress response (ISR), a conserved signaling network that restores protein homeostasis by
regulating protein synthesis, and a main causative pathway underlying the memory deficits associated with a
wide range of cognitive disorders. The goal of this competing renewal is to define the precise molecular,
cellular, and circuit mechanisms by which activation of the ISR leads to cognitive dysfunction. In Aim 1, we will
generate and characterize mice carrying a human mutation in a key component of the ISR, which activates the
ISR, and is associated with intellectual disability. In Aim 2, we will generate and use state-of-the-art, novel molecular-
genetic approaches to identify the specific cell types in the brain driving the long-term memory deficits upon
activation of the ISR. Finally, in Aim 3, we will develop a novel high-throughput screening platform to identify new
inhibitors of the ISR. The results of these Aims will provide new fundamental insights into the biological basis
of cognitive dysfunction and hold the hope of opening new therapeutic avenues for cognitive disorders resulting
from perturbation of protein homeostasis."
10892115,"The overarching goal of this project is to reveal the microstructural features that underlie the
diffusion-time dependent changes in the apparent diffusion coefficient measured diffusion
weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) in neural tissue. While time dependent changes in
the diffusion coefficient have been measured in numerous previous studies of neural tissue, the
exact microstructural characteristics of that underly these changes remain unclear. Uncovering
the microstructure that underly these measurements could improve the diagnosis, staging and
differentiation of numerous neurological diseases that otherwise show nonspecific changes with
DWI. We propose that time dependent changes in diffusion originate primarily from three
sources: mean axon diameter, heterogeneity of extra-axonal space, and orientation dispersion.
Within this project, we propose to (1) develop and use numerical simulations to test the
sensitivity of time dependent diffusion to tissue microstructure, (2) validate time dependent
changes in the diffusion coefficient in specific animal models that vary axon diameter,
heterogeneity of extra-axonal space, and complexity of white matter, and (3) provide baseline
estimates of the time dependent diffusion coefficient and the variability in these measurements
in a population of healthy human controls."

This proposal aims to examine four interrelated pathways by which psychosocial and socioeconomic stressors
may lead to poorer bladder health (lower urinary tract symptoms [LUTS] and impact of symptoms) among
women and men across the life course: affective, cognitive, behavioral, and physiological pathways. The
proposed work leverages data and intellectual resources from two NIH initiatives, the 30+ year Coronary Artery
Risk Development in Adults (CARDIA) cohort study, initiated in 1985, and the Prevention of Lower Urinary
Tract Symptoms (PLUS) Research Consortium, initiated in 2015. LUTS, including overactive bladder (OAB)
and urinary incontinence (UI), affect the lives of millions of women and men. Prevention of LUTS has been
hindered by a lack of epidemiologic research utilizing life course data. In addition, little research has
incorporated the concept of well-being and examined factors that promote and maintain bladder health, defined
by the PLUS Research Consortium as “a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being…that
permits daily activities, adapts to short-term physical and environmental stressors, and allows optimal well-
being (e.g., travel, exercise, social, occupational, or other activities).” The proposed research, which extends
beyond PLUS Research Consortium activities, utilizes existing CARDIA data from women and men with
bladder health and LUTS and invites a subsample of CARDIA participants recruited from the Year 35
examination (ages 53-65; funded for 2021-22) to complete a new clinical examination. Analyses will strengthen
the evidence base for individual pathways that may promote bladder health or LUTS. It is hypothesized that
poorer bladder health/LUTS status will be observed as a result of (1) depressive symptoms (affect), (2)
impaired cognition, (3) behavioral factors (poor diet, physical inactivity, smoking), and (4) physiological factors
(weight gain, central adiposity, hyperglycemia, hypertension, inflammatory biomarkers, and pelvic floor muscle
weakness). Analyses will also establish the evidence base for psychosocial and socioeconomic stressors. It is
hypothesized that stressors (adverse childhood family environment, stressful life events, job strain, caregiving
stress, chronic burden, discrimination, financial hardship, low subjective social standing) will be associated with
poorer bladder health/LUTS status. Finally, analyses will examine whether individual pathways mediate
proposed associations between stressors and poor bladder health/LUTS status, and whether resources for
support weaken hypothesized effects. There is a clear need to develop new approaches to improve both
prevention and early treatment of LUTS. Our findings may inform “upstream” approaches (e.g., amelioration of
specific stressors shown to serve as risk factors, enhancement of social support and ties shown to serve as a
protective factors), as well as “downstream” approaches (e.g., treatment of depressive symptoms; cognitive
training exercises; weight loss; behavior modification, including pelvic floor exercises)."

The Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP) is redefining our understanding of the human body by 
recovering multi-scale tissue organization--anatomical, histological, and molecular--at unprecedented resolution, 
through computational integration of diverse experimental measurements. The current HuBMAP HIVE has led 
the development of a human common coordinate framework (CCF); constructed molecularly and spatially 
resolved reference maps of human tissues; developed mapping frameworks for the interpretation of new 
datasets; and coordinated extensive collaborative activities both within HuBMAP and with the broader 
community. In Y5-8, we will construct a Human Reference Atlas (HRA), establishing the HuBMAP Portal as the 
“go-to” resource for human tissue reference maps and multimodal single-cell data. We propose a Mapping 
Center to build upon our progress in Y1-4, and achieve these goals. Our center represents a synergistic 
collaboration between three labs, Dr. Rahul Satija (NYGC/NYU), Dr. John Marioni (EMBL/EBI), and Dr. Jean 
Fan (JHU). Our Mapping Center proposes to lead a series of key tasks for HuBMAP. These include the 
construction of single-cell reference maps for 30 human tissues, where maps will be constructed by harmonizing 
a wide diversity of multimodal single-cell technologies. We also propose to lead the development of mapping 
tools that will enable users in the community to upload their own datasets and map them to HuBMAP references. 
Importantly, these tools will not be limited to single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, but will be extended to process
datasets that measure chromatin accessibility, chromatin modifications, DNA methylation, intracellular and 
surface protein levels, and metabolic profiles as well. We also propose to lead the development of statistical 
methods to perform comparative analysis of multiple datasets. This will enable key use-cases for users both 
within and outside of HuBMAP, including the ability to perform comparative analysis of healthy vs. diseased 
tissue. We expect our MC to work together with and lead the HubMAP community to a deeper understanding of 
the functional organization of human tissues and, and to explore how molecular state, environment, and 
anatomical location, affect cellular identity and behavior."

Approximately 70% of the more than 7.2 million U.S. stroke survivors experience persistent gait deficits, including
reduced walking speed, asymmetrical walking patterns, and reduced lower limb coordination, which limit their
capacity for community ambulation. Current rehabilitation approaches are based on the assumption that stroke
impairs motor cortex function while the spinal cord is preserved and thus focus on stimulating the ipsilateral or
contralateral motor cortex during gait training to activate dormant or new pathways. Although animal models of
stroke reveal secondary degeneration of the cervical and lumbar spinal cord, suggesting that damage to the
spinal cord may effect functional recovery, little or no research has been done to elucidate spinal cord changes
in humans after stroke. Our objective is to evaluate the effects of spinal stimulation combined with gait training
after stroke and to investigate mechanisms underlying these effects. In preliminary work, we measured spinally
evoked motor potentials (sEMPs) generated by non-invasive, transcutaneous electrical spinal stimulation in 10
stroke survivors, 10 age-matched healthy controls, and 10 young healthy subjects. Stimulation thresholds were
significantly higher in stroke survivors than in controls and latency was significantly delayed in the paretic side
compared to the non-paretic side, indicating secondary effects of stroke on downstream spinal circuitry and
descending pathways. We also showed that spinal stimulation + symmetry-focused gait training (n=4) compared
to gait training alone (n=4), significantly improved step-length symmetry, walking speed (10-meter walk test,
10MWT), and walking endurance (6-minute walk test, 6MWT); these improvements exceeded the minimal
clinically important difference for chronic stroke. These results support our hypothesis that spinal stimulation may
increase gait training efficacy. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the short-term effects of spinal stimulation and sham
stimulation, with or without symmetry-focused gait training, on gait function (primary outcome: step-length
symmetry) and corticospinal circuitry in 25 stroke survivors. In Aim 2, we will conduct a randomized clinical trial
to evaluate the long-term effects of symmetry-focused gait training with stim or sham stimulation in stroke
survivors (n=25 per group). The primary outcome will be step-length symmetry; secondary outcomes include
temporal gait symmetry, speed (10MWT), muscle activation (electromyography), walking endurance (6MWT),
energy expenditure (Cosmed K4B2), upper and lower limb function (Fugl-Meyer Assessment), health status
(Stroke Impact Scale-16), and community activity (wearable sensors, Actigraph LLC). We will also investigate
mechanisms underlying the effects of spinal stimulation by examining sEMPs elicited in lower limb muscles by
cortical/subcortical stimulation of corticospinal axons and intracortical inhibition. This work will (i) identify short-
and long-term effects of spinal stimulation, (ii) validate spinal stimulation as a non-invasive method to restore
gait in chronic stroke, (iii) identify clinical measures that may determine response to spinal stimulation, and (iv)
identify underlying neuromodulatory mechanisms, which may provide additional treatment options."

Low-value care, or the provision of care without net benefit, is associated with patient harm and billions of dollars
in unnecessary medical costs.18,19 One example is the prescription of antibiotics for viral upper respiratory
infections (URIs). It is estimated that over 50% of antibiotic prescriptions for respiratory infections are
unnecessary and cost over $700 million per year.20 Antibiotics can increase antimicrobial resistance, and cause
adverse events in 10% of patients.21 The Choosing Wisely initiative has been joined by over 80 specialty
societies, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, to develop recommendations against low-value care.
Despite these recommendations, low-value care continues to affect one in ten children every year.22 To plan for
future de-implementation research involving claims-based audit and feedback, we selected three types of
pediatric low-value care based on high prevalence22 and the ability to distinguish low-value care using claims
data: 1) antibiotics for viral URIs, 2) vitamin D screening in healthy children and 3) antacid medications for infant
reflux. It is not well understood to what extent providers are familiar with these recommendations against low-
value care. Even if a provider is aware of recommendations against low-value care, there can be other barriers
to de-implementation such cognitive biases that favor historical practices, discomfort with diagnostic uncertainty
or unease in discussing low-value care with families.23 In Aim 1, we will first evaluate the patient (age, race, sex,
insurance type), provider (medical specialty) and system-level factors (clinical setting, healthcare system,
rurality) associated with the three different types of low-value care. In Aim 2, we will query providers about 1)
knowledge of, 2) agreement with, and 3) actions regarding the three Choosing Wisely recommendations. We
will use the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) framework24-26 to interview a subset
of providers about barriers to de-implementation. We will use this information to design a targeted and effective
de-implementation strategy that can be used across the Commonwealth of Virginia.
This proposal builds on Dr. Wolf's KL2 study related to the delivery of evidence-based, high-value care and her
clinical training in general pediatrics. The Center for Clinical and Translational Research (CTSA) will support use
of the All-Payers Claims Database (APCD) and mentorship by Drs. Krist and Sabo who have expertise in patient-
oriented health services research and implementation science. During the study period, Dr. Wolf will address
critical gaps of knowledge about what drives the delivery of low-value care in children and what prevents
providers from de-implementing low-value practices. By engaging providers in her research, she will design an
intervention that is consistent with their values, preferences, and goals. Ultimately, this proposal will allow Dr.
Wolf to build a larger research program to investigate system-oriented, patient-centered solutions to reduce low-
value care for children."
10884513,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Liver disease mortality is a key contributor to recent declines in life expectancy in the US. Decades of
research have demonstrated the disproportionate burden of liver disease among racial/ethnic minorities and
those with low-socioeconomic position. With the ongoing epidemic of obesity, and the increase in alcohol
consumption, fatty liver diseases (FLD), including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and alcohol-related
liver disease (ALD), have become the most prevalent chronic liver conditions affecting millions of people
worldwide, constituting a major and growing public health problem. FLD epidemiology has largely focused on
the role of individual-level behavioral factors, such as obesity and alcohol consumption, in FLD development.
However, individual-focused therapeutic and preventive efforts have had limited success. For many chronic
diseases, abundant literature has documented how social and physical environments pattern population health.
In contrast, the empirical evidence of the role of social determinants of health with FLD and its disparities is
extremely limited. Furthermore, the current paradigm to explain FLD disparities is heavily focused on genetic
susceptibility (e.g. PNPLA3 gene variants).
 To address these research gaps, this project will test the novel hypothesis that individual and community-
level social determinants influence FLD risk and their social and racial/ethnic disparities. To test this hypothesis,
we propose to obtain and analyze longitudinal measures of liver fat and inflammation among participants of the
Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), the largest ongoing multi-racial population-based cohort study
involving 6,814 men and women (22% Hispanic, 38% whites, 28% Blacks, 12% Chinese) from 6 geographically
distinct areas of the US. MESA has the most comprehensive longitudinal data on socioeconomic (both individual
and community level), psychosocial, neighborhood physical and social environment, environmental, behavioral,
and biomedical (including genetics) factors and health outcomes with up to 21 years of follow up. Our specific
aims are: 1) Characterize racial/ethnic disparities in FLD incidence, as measured by 10-year changes in CT-
measured liver fat and liver enzymes, while accounting for genetic variants. 2) Examine the prospective
association of individual-level socioeconomic position (SEP) and psychosocial stressors with FLD incidence and
the contribution of SEP and psychosocial factors to socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in FLD incidence.
3) Examine the prospective association of community-level social and physical features with FLD incidence and
its racial/ethnic disparities in FLD incidence. 4) Examine the role of community-level social and physical features
in magnifying individual-level genetic vulnerability by testing gene-by-environment interactions in the incidence
of FLD between genetic variants and contextual factors. This project will constitute the largest, most rigorous
and comprehensive investigation of the role of social determinants of health in the development and progression
of FLD and its disparities."
10874501,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Glaucoma remains the second leading cause of blindness worldwide. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a
characteristic risk factor for glaucoma, and all current treatments are to lower or control IOP and thereby slow
down or reduce the subsequent vision loss. Elevated IOP in glaucoma is primarily due to impaired aqueous
outflow drainage and consequently increased outflow resistance. Current IOP-reducing strategies include
reduction of aqueous humor using beta-blockers, adrenergic agonists, or carbonic anhydrase inhibitors,
promotion of aqueous humor outflow via the uveoscleral pathway using prostaglandins, or combination of both
actions. Various formulations, including nanoparticulate systems, have been developed to deliver antiglaucoma
drugs topically to promote outflow through the uveoscleral pathway. The trabecular meshwork (TM) pathway is
another major independent route for controlling the intraocular pressure. Nevertheless, how to design
nanoparticle-based delivery systems to fully utilize the outflow pathway in TM for more effective IOP reduction
has not been systematically investigated but will be the focus of this project. We pioneered an unconventional
concept of utilizing highly-branched tunable dendrimers to form nanostructured dendrimer hydrogel particles
(nDHPs). We showed that nDHPs overcome the pulsatile delivery of most antiglaucoma drugs, synchronize drug
release following zero-order kinetics (i.e., constant release rate), have good corneal permeation and enable long-
acting effects. Based on nDHPs, we will test a three-pronged strategy to reduce IOP by reducing aqueous humor
production and simultaneous outflow promotion through the two independent pathways—the TM and uveoscleral.
Our objective is to maximize antiglaucoma therapeutic benefits by our newly designed nDHP-based system. We
hypothesize that nDHP-based delivery systems provide a modular platform incorporating drugs in different
modes of action to increase their dose effectiveness and coordinate their release for extended antiglaucoma
effects. To test the hypothesis, we propose the following aims. Aim 1) Establish nDHP-mediated short- and long-
term IOP lowering effects by modulation of aqueous humor production and outflow in a mouse model of glaucoma.
Aim 2) Gain mechanistic understanding of dynamic ocular distributions of nDHPs and drugs delivered by nDHPs
through the outflow pathways. Aim 3) Determine the antiglaucoma effects of nDHP-based fixed-combination
formulations in controlling IOP and slowing down vision loss. Our proposed research will investigate the three-
pronged strategy that it has potential to be more effective in achieving IOP reduction. The new formulation based
on this novel therapeutic intervention will be clinically impactful for improving glaucoma treatment and patient
adherence."
10914800,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Emergent Bilingual (EB) children of Spanish-dominant caregivers represent a large and growing proportion of
the school-aged United States population. For EBs, developing proficiency in the language used by caregivers
at home is foundational to supportive family relationships and later school outcomes, yet research has shown
declines in EBs’ home language proficiency after school entry (Castilla-Earls et al., 2019; Jackson et al., 2014).
A particularly vulnerable subset of EBs are those with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD), which is
characterized by low language skills despite otherwise normal development and occurs in about 7% of children.
Given the scarcity of bilingual service providers, caregiver-delivered language interventions are a practical and
promising approach to preventing and treating DLD in the home language. Yet little is known about the specific
caregiver behaviors that sustain home language development in EBs with or at-risk for DLD in preschool (age
3-5), a period when overall exposure to English increases. This project addresses this critical gap while
supporting the candidate’s transition to independence through training in child language disorders, parenting
interventions, and novel approaches to using bilingual daylong recordings. By leveraging observational language
data from two large-scale randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of a parent-coaching program called Play and
Learning Strategies (PALS; Landry et al., 2008) the current project will identify caregiver behaviors specific to
bilingual contexts that contribute to preschool-aged EBs’ home language use and skills. During the mentored
K99 phase, using existing data from a completed RCT, Aim 1 will determine the impact of PALS on targeted
caregiver behaviors (e.g., contingent responsiveness) and child Spanish outcomes with the subset of parents
who received coaching in Spanish (T=71, C=70). Aim 2 will recode video observations from this dataset to
identify home-language supportive behaviors (e.g., caregivers Spanish use, responses to child English use) that
predict children’s later Spanish proficiency (n=141). Next, new daylong recordings (n=160) will be collected
alongside an ongoing PALS RCT tailored for Spanish-English EBs at risk for DLD (risk determined via Spanish
and English language screeners at preschool entry). During the independent R00 phase, Aim 3 will determine
1) whether home-language supportive behaviors captured in daylong recordings predict child Spanish outcomes
and 2) whether PALS coaching leads to changes in these behaviors, which in turn explain child Spanish
outcomes. By capturing spontaneous language-rich interactions that occur throughout the day with different
conversation partners in the context of a larger ongoing RCT, this project promises to generate new insights into
the conditions and caregiver behaviors that support bilingual development in EBs with DLD and inform culturally
and linguistically-sustaining interventions. This award also provides critical training that builds on the candidate’s
background in bilingual language development and positions her to launch an independent research program
focused on the intersection of bilingualism and language difficulties in preschool-aged children."

Project Summary
Studying the mechanisms underlying the protection of common fragile sites and structure-
prone DNA sequences
Project Summary/Abstract
 Common fragile sites (CFSs) are large chromosomal regions that often exhibit gaps and
breaks on metaphase chromosomes upon replication stress. Structure-prone AT-rich sequences
present at CFSs (CFS-ATs) contribute to CFS instability. Besides CFS-ATs, other structure-prone
DNA sequences, such as G-quadruplexes (G4s), are also abundant in the human genome and are
associated with chromosomal rearrangement breakpoints in cancer. Since CFSs and many
structure-prone DNA sequences, including G4s, are part of normal chromosomal structures, it is
important to understand how the integrity of these structure-prone DNA sequences is maintained in
mammalian cells. In this grant application, we will use EGFP-based DSB repair reporters to
investigate the mechanisms underlying the protection of structure-prone DNA sequences present at
CFSs and G4s. We will study the role of chromatin-remodeling in the maintenance of CFSs and
address the DSB repair mechanism specifically used to repair DSBs arising at DNA secondary
structures upon fork collapse. We will also explore the functional coordination of pathways involved
in protecting structure-prone DNA sequences from DSB formation and in repairing DSBs generated
upon fork collapse at structure-prone DNA sequences. Furthermore, we will study how mismatch
repair (MMR) proteins help preserve the integrity of structure-prone DNA sequences. Our studies
will yield molecular insights into the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of the integrity of CFS
and other structure-prone DNA sequences. These studies will also lay the groundwork for
development of new targeted cancer treatment strategies."

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent primary malignant brain tumor and continues to progress despite 
aggressive therapies including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. The interaction between tumor cells and 
their surrounding microenvironment directly impacts their growth and resistance to conventional therapies. We 
have had a long-standing interest in the mechanisms responsible for cellular interactions in the context of 
cancer stem cells (CSCs) and previously identified a pro-tumiogenic function for junctional adhesion molecule- 
A (JAM-A) in CSC maintenance. To test the function of JAM-A in the tumor microenvironment, we utilized 
JAM-A knockout mice to assess the growth of syngeneic mouse glioma cells. We found sex-specific 
differences in survival, with female knockout mice having more aggressive tumors, suggesting that JAM-A 
functioned as a tumor suppressor in the female microenvironment. Additional assessments revealed an 
increase in the number and activation status microglia, the native immune cells of the brain, and lipocalin 2 
(LCN2) signaling in the female JAM-A knockout mice, highlighting an underlying sex-specific difference in the 
function of JAM-A in the tumor microenvironment. These findings serve as the basis for this project to further 
interrogate this newly identified, sex-specific difference in JAM-A in the tumor microenvironment in the context 
of a larger Program Project application on sex differences in GBM. 
The translational goal of this project is to conduct mechanistic studies on the sex-specific function of JAM-A in 
immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. This will be achieved using a combination of genetic mouse 
models, syngeneic mouse glioma models, and a high-resolution assessments of immune cells in the tumor 
microenvironment and in vivo imaging platform, with validation in human tissue. We hypothesize that JAM-A 
functions as a female microenvironment tumor suppressor by reducing microglial and immune 
activation and LCN2 signaling. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that JAM-A functions as a tumor suppressor in 
females via differential microglia activation and tumor-host interactions. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that 
LCN2 in the GBM microenvironment enhances tumor cellular iron uptake and can be targeted to attenuate 
tumor growth and invasion in a sex-specific manner. The long-term goal of this project is to identify the function 
of JAM-A in the GBM microenvironment and pinpoint specific mechanisms that can be leveraged to reduce 
GBM growth for sex-specific personalized medicine approaches. This project integrates with Project 1 and 
Project 2 of this P01 and will be enhanced by the cores. Results from this project will impact Project 1 by 
providing an opportunity to determine whether cell intrinsic or extrinsic sex differences are the dominant 
contributor to tumor growth and dispersion and will impact Project 2 by determining how sex-specific immune 
cell differences can synergize with or neutralize iron metabolism."

10868732,"SUMMARY
It is increasingly recognized that global goals for HIV epidemic control cannot be realized without improving
retention in HIV care and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Only 58% of people living with HIV
(PLHIV) in eastern and southern Africa are virally suppressed, and adherence counseling provided to those
with elevated viral loads results in viral suppression only 40-50% of the time. Financial incentives, first used for
poverty reduction, have been shown to motivate behavior change and improve engagement in HIV-related
services. However, there is a paucity of data about the effectiveness of incentive-based programs for people
who have disengaged from HIV care as well as the proactive use of incentives for PLHIV struggling with
adherence. This research gap limits our understanding of whether financial incentive programs are worthwhile
investments to support lifelong care, which is essential to the success of ‘treatment as HIV prevention’ (TasP).
The proposed research will advance global knowledge about the effectiveness of financial incentives for
strengthening the continuity of HIV care. We will build on data from a pilot study we conducted in Tanzania
which found that an intervention offering a one-time financial incentive to out-of-care PLHIV was feasible,
acceptable, and preliminarily efficacious at motivating re-engagement in HIV care. Leveraging our established
research program and expertise with behavioral economics, we designed a 5-year, mixed-methods, hybrid
effectiveness-implementation study to evaluate the financial incentive intervention and describe its successful
implementation, with the ultimate goal of closing the gap towards achievement of UNAIDS’ ‘95-95-95’ goals. We
will first assess if a one-time financial incentive improves re-engagement in care and durable viral suppression
at 12 months among 640 PLHIV in Geita and Kagera Regions who have disengaged from care (Aim 1). We
will then measure the effectiveness of short-term financial incentives offered to 692 in-care PLHIV who are at
risk of loss to follow-up or poor adherence, with durable viral suppression at 12 months as the outcome (Aim
2). A mixed-methods study will describe implementation successes and challenges and synthesize lessons
learned to inform adoption of incentive programs for vulnerable PLHIV (Aim 3). The project is a collaboration of
the University of California, Berkeley, Health for a Prosperous Nation, Rasello, Management and Development
for Health, and the Tanzania Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly, and Children.
At the conclusion of the project, we will have rigorously evaluated the incentive strategy and will understand
whether it can mitigate the persistent challenge of disengagement from HIV care, consistent with NIH Office of
AIDS Research priorities for implementation research on retention in care and adherence to ART. This
information is highly relevant to the spectrum of incentive-based programs being implemented or under
consideration to improve the health of PLHIV and to optimize TasP programs in UNAIDS Fast Track countries.

Intracellular bacterial pathogens remain a major cause of human mortality and morbidity. By working
collaboratively with other P01 Projects, we focus in Project 3 on the role of type I interferons (IFNs) in the
innate immune response to three intracellular bacterial pathogens: Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, and Legionella pneumophila. As we and others have shown previously, all three pathogens
induce the expression of type I IFNs via the STING pathway. However, while type I IFNs are generally
accepted to play a crucial role in orchestrating anti-viral immunity, the roles of type I IFNs in the responses
to bacteria are complex. Indeed, our work and that of other laboratories has shown that type I IFNs tend to
exacerbate infection by bacterial pathogens, including M. tuberculosis, L. pneumophila and L.
monocytogenes. Our preliminary data suggest that type I IFN-dependent induction of the interleukin-1
receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) is an important mechanism by which type I IFNs exacerbate bacterial
infections. Our preliminary data also suggest the existence of regulatory pathways to prevent the adverse
induction of type I IFNs during bacterial infections. We identify SP140 and MORC3 as two novel negative
regulators of type I IFN expression. We propose three Aims to explain why type I IFNs hinder anti-bacterial
immunity and to explain how interferons are normally properly regulated during bacterial infections, in both
mice and humans. In Aim 1, we test the hypothesis that type I IFNs antagonize anti-bacterial immunity via
induction of IL-1 receptor antagonist, and determine the underlying mechanism. In Aim 2, we dissect the
mechanism by which SP140 negatively regulates type I IFN transcription during bacterial infections. In Aim
3, we identify and characterize MORC3 as a novel negative regulator of type I IFN in human cells, and
determine its function during bacterial infection."
10843833,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding CF transmembrane
conductance regulator (CFTR), an ion channel essential for mucus hydration. Improper hydration of mucus leads
to airway inflammation, chronic pulmonary infections and abnormal mucociliary function. The major contributor
to morbidity and mortality in CF is a progressive decline in lung function. Recent advances in therapies that
modulate mutant CFTR for those with the most common CFTR mutations have led to dramatic improvements in
lung function. Despite the considerable improvements afforded by these CFTR modulators, there is no evidence
that they improve underlying airway inflammation as lung function continues to decline over time. The
identification of therapies that target this inflammation will be critical to ensuring that the long-term benefits of
CFTR modulators are fully realized. Preliminary in vitro evidence from the applicant demonstrates that losartan,
a common anti-hypertensive medication with known anti-inflammatory properties, can improve the efficacy of
CFTR modulators in the presence of inflammation. This proposal aims to further our understanding of the impact
of inflammation on response to CFTR modulator therapy and, using a novel enrollment strategy, evaluate if
losartan is able to further improve CFTR function in those with CF on the modulator
elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI). In aim 1, we will sample the nasal fluid of those with CF on ETI and, using
regression analysis, examine the association of expression levels of the inflammatory marker TGF-1 on change
in lung function after starting ETI. In aim 2a, we will conduct a randomized, double-blind clinical trial of losartan
to improve CFTR function, as measured by sweat chloride, in those with CF on ETI. We will utilize a prognostic
enrichment strategy by including only those with the persistently elevated sweat chloride levels after starting ETI.
Additionally, in aim 2b, we will correlate the response in aim 2a with in vitro measurement of CFTR current in
patient-derived nasal epithelial cells (NECs) treated with losartan and ETI in order to understand if it could be
utilized as a prediction of in vivo response. The long-term goal of the applicant is to become an independent
investigator who, through application of novel, adaptive, clinical trial techniques, evaluates therapies which have
the potential to improve outcomes of those with CF. He has prior experience in using in vitro and in vivo methods
to further understanding of the effects of inflammation and hyperglycemia on mucociliary clearance and formal
training in basic biostatistics and clinical research. The career development plan associated with this proposal
pairs an experienced, diverse mentoring team with additional training in advanced biostatistics, adaptive clinical
trial design and utilization of patient-derived NECs. This will uniquely position the applicant to design and lead
clinical trials using efficient, adaptive strategies to test the next generation of therapies for those with CF."
10814924,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There are approximately four million referrals to child protective services (CPS) in the United States each year.
Children and youth who receive adequate support often experience fewer negative physical, mental, and social
health outcomes and are less likely to perpetrate violence in the future than their peers who received no or
inadequate support. Younger children tend to exhibit signs and symptoms that help others to identify their need
for intervention. However, young people are unlikely to discuss and report their experiences through traditional,
face-to-face interactions. Technology-facilitated communication (e.g., text, chat, social media) is the preferred
communication method for many young people. The candidate’s prior work demonstrated that many young
people share their child maltreatment experiences through social media and other technology-facilitated
platforms. Thus, technology-facilitated communication may be leveraged to support young people through their
help-seeking experience and connect them with appropriate resources. The objectives of this K01 are twofold:
1) This K01 will support the candidate to gain additional training required for an independent, interdisciplinary
research career developing and evaluating technology-based interventions that support young people while
seeking maltreatment-related resources and information. Working with a team of experts in the fields of
developmental psychology, child and adolescent health, bioethics (including online research and research with
vulnerable populations), computational analytics, and digital health communication, the candidate will gain 1a)
knowledge and expertise in research ethics related to technology and vulnerable populations, 1b) skills in
computational data analytics and visualization, and 1c) experience in developing and implementing health
communication interventions. 2) The research conducted through this K01 will build the empirical foundations
for future interventions by 2a) identifying the language used by young people to discuss their maltreatment
experiences (Aim 1), 2b) evaluating the feasibility of using technology to reach young people seeking
maltreatment-related information and support (Aim 2), and 2c) developing and piloting technology-facilitated
interventions that connect young people to appropriate resources (Aim 3). After completing the training and
research activities proposed in this K01, the candidate will be uniquely prepared to launch a career as an NIH-
funded researcher investigating novel approaches to preventing the negative health consequences of child
maltreatment."

Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a cardiac channelopathy that predispose individuals to ventricular arrhythmias and
cardiac arrest. Type 1 LQTS (LQT1) is caused by mutations in KCNQ1 or KCNE1, genes that encode for voltage-
gated K+ (Kv7.1) channels and auxiliary subunits, respectively. Mothers with pathogenic Kv7.1 variants show
higher prevalence of fetal growth restriction and pregnancy loss compared to general population. Kv7 channels
have been shown to contribute to the vasodilation of human placental vessels, which are important in maintaining
uteroplacental perfusion during pregnancy. Kv7 expression in placental chorionic plate arteries is reduced in
pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia. However, the role of Kv7.1 in vasodilatory responses in
maternal resistance vessels (i.e., myometrial arteries) during normal or complicated pregnancies has not been
elucidated. Our lab has extensive experience in vasoreactivity of myometrial arteries in healthy and pregnancy
complications. Our preliminary data show that Kv7.1-dependent vasodilation of chorionic plate arteries is
reduced in some LQT1 patients compared with healthy controls. Thus, we hypothesize that impaired function
and/or expression of Kv7.1 in myometrial and/or placental arteries underlies the adverse pregnancy outcomes
observed in LQT1 patients. To test this hypothesis, we propose to conduct two integrated scientific aims. In Aim
1, we will address the vasodilatory role of Kv7.1 channels in myometrial and chorionic plate arteries isolated from
women with LQT1 or normal pregnancies after delivery by C-section. We will assess vasodilation in vitro via wire
myography. We will also evaluate the Kv7 and ancillary proteins expression and localization in myometrial and
placental tissue. Aim 2 will determine whether clinical ultrasound indices of uteroplacental blood flow can predict
placental insufficiency in LQT1 women. We will use 3-D power ultrasound to assess uterine artery blood flow
and placental vascularization indices at three different gestational ages (14, 20 and 34 weeks) in control and
LQT1 women. We will correlate these measurements with fetal and neonatal biometry and pregnancy outcomes.
Scientifically, the work proposed is vital to improving our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the
reduced fetal growth and adverse pregnancy outcomes observed in LQT1 women. Our proposed project also
has potentially important clinical implications; in particular, our study outcomes may identify novel therapeutic
targets and diagnostic approaches to prevent these pregnancy complications."
10876341,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Group B Streptococcus (GBS), is an opportunistic pathogen that asymptomatically colonizes the urogenital and
female reproductive tract of approximately 25-30% of individuals. However, GBS can cause serious infections
in immunocompromised individuals including those with diabetes. Diabetic wound infections are a major public
health burden, with approximately 25% of diabetic individuals developing a wound in their lifetime, 25% of these
wounds not healing and 28% requiring surgical amputation. Poor infection outcomes are correlated with the
presence of numerous bacterial pathogens, and GBS, along with Staphylococcus aureus, is one of the most
common bacteria found in these wounds. Despite its prevalence, no prior work has been done on GBS
pathogenesis in the diabetic wound environment. Recently, we developed a Type 2 diabetic murine model of
GBS diabetic wound infection in leprdb mice, and demonstrated that GBS forms a robust wound and persists in
this environment. Further observations found that GBS colonies recovered from diabetic wound tissue were
hyper-pigmented/hemolytic, suggesting selection of more virulent GBS mutants during diabetic infection.
These phenotypes mimic those of a covR mutant, as CovR is a major repressor of GBS virulence factors such
as the GBS hemolysin/pigment, nuclease (NucA), and surface adhesin plasminogen binding protein PbsP. Dual
RNA-sequencing of GBS and the murine wound revealed that these same CovR regulated genes were highly
upregulated in the diabetic wound. In addition, GBS infection triggered the recruitment of neutrophils, neutrophil
activation and NET formation at the site of infection. Finally, we have shown in our murine model that the
presence of S. aureus promotes GBS persistence in the diabetic wound. With these preliminary data, we have
formulated hypotheses which address multiple mechanisms by which GBS may survive and persist in the
diabetic wound environment. These hypotheses will be addressed in the following specific aims: Aim 1:
Determine how CovR regulation contributes to diabetic wound infection, Aim 2: Characterize the
contribution of PbsP to GBS diabetic wound formation, persistence, and dissemination, Aim 3: Examine
the contribution of nuclease activity in promoting GBS immune evasion and wound persistence. These
studies will increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of GBS diabetic wound infection and will provide a
platform for additional studies."
10828923,"We will evaluate the biological necessity of an intronic enhancer of SNCA and determine its relevance to
Parkinson disease (PD). SNCA is frequently mutated in familial PD; it encodes alpha-synuclein (α-syn), the
primary constituent of Lewy bodies (LB). LB formation/accumulation is a pathological hallmark of PD and is
driven by protein misfolding promoted by SNCA structural mutation, gene amplification, or genetic/environmental
insults that elevate α-syn levels. Noncoding variants predicted to impact SNCA transcriptional regulatory control
are also risk factors for sporadic PD. We recently identified PD-associated variants in SNCA intron 4. These
variants lie within a dopaminergic (DA) neuron open chromatin region (OCR) that we have shown interacts with
the SNCA promoter and is a cis-regulatory enhancer in catecholaminergic neurons. We predict that this
sequence, and the variants therein, impact SNCA transcriptional control and modulate PD risk.
 Hypothesis - Deletion of the Snca enhancer in mice will reduce Snca transcription in PD-relevant cells with
potential impact on their viability/distribution, and on motor/non-motor PD phenotypes (Aim 1); deletion will
reduce DA neuron vulnerability to PD-relevant insults and ameliorate the onset and severity of disease (Aim2).
 Several highly effective strategies exist to elicit Parkinsonian pathology in mice. Tetracycline (tet)-dependent
expression of PD mutant and wild-type (WT) forms of SNCA in DA neurons result in marked and progressive
loss of ventral midbrain DA neuron populations, consistent with PD pathology. Likewise, intrastriatal injection of
α-syn pre-formed fibrils (PFF) also result in a mouse model that exhibits progressive DA neuronal loss.
Consistent with the known role of Snca levels impacting PD risk and progression, α-syn deficient mice are
protected from PFF-induced neurodegeneration and from tet-dependent expression (via viral vector) of the PD
missense mutant (hA53T) or WT SNCA. α-syn null mice are also protected from the neurotoxic effects of other
PD promoting (and Snca-elevating) insults, like MPTP, 6-OHDA, and LPS. We will test whether cell-dependent
titration of Snca levels, similarly, ameliorates risk and progression in a new mouse model.
 We have engineered mouse lines lacking this enhancer (Snca Enhdel) and provide preliminary evidence that
this sequence impacts Snca transcription. Using established techniques, we propose to assay the effect of Snca
Enhdel on prodromal, behavioral, and motor phenotypes (Aim 1a), as well as on PD-relevant neuron
viability/distribution and microglial activation in the midbrain and olfactory bulb (Aim 1b) via
immunohistochemistry and single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization. Similarly, we will determine
whether Snca Enhdel reduces onset and progression of prodromal/motor/non-motor disease phenotypes (Aim
2a) and impacts DA neuron vulnerability (Aim 2b) when exposed to PD-relevant insults (intrastriatal injection of
SNCA PFF and adenoviral-delivery of SNCA hA53T). We will establish the extent to which modulating Snca
transcription impacts risk of PD relevant pathology in mice, and its potential as a novel therapeutic avenue."

The APOE gene, which encodes the apoE protein, is the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease
(AD). However, it remains unclear how different apoE isoforms impact aging and AD. The overall goal of this
U19 proposal is to test the ApoE Cascade Hypothesis (ACH) that the biochemical and structural differences
between apoE isoforms initiate their differential effects on a cascade of events at the cellular and systems
levels, ultimately impacting aging-related pathogenic conditions including AD. One hurdle to testing this
hypothesis is that the field currently lacks a detailed understanding of the biochemical and structural properties
of different apoE isoforms in their native, lipid-bound states—called lipoproteins. Core B will provide
biochemistry and structural modeling services to support other U19 projects/cores, helping to uncover the
biochemical composition and atomically-detailed structures of lipoproteins. Specifically, we will establish
standard protocols for isolating lipoproteins and characterizing their size distribution, lipid composition, and
post-translational modifications. We will also develop methods for integrating information from molecular
dynamics simulations and structural experiments performed in Project 1 to build atomically-detailed models of
the ensemble of structures that lipoproteins adopt. The Core will analyze the data generated to identify
signatures that are predictive of the impact of different apoE isoforms on aging and AD."

The Neuropathology Core (Core C) supports the ultimate goal of understanding the ApoE Cascade Hypothesis
by providing neuropathologic support to the projects and cores of the U19. A major focus of Core C efforts is
on assessing the impact of APOE genotype on comorbid pathologies in Alzheimer’s disease and other aging-
related conditions. The brain bank at Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville (MCJ) will be the major source of postmortem
brain samples used in the cores and projects, supplemented by samples from the brain bank at Washington
University in St. Louis (WUSTL). Brain samples will be crucial to analyses of biochemical and biophysical
properties of brain apoE-lipoprotein particles performed by Core B and for the proteomic and transcriptomic
studies performed by Core F. Core C will characterize tissues provided to the investigators in the U19 using
immunoassays that measure levels of apoE, Aβ, tau, synaptic markers, glial activation markers, inflammatory
cytokines, as well as markers of vascular integrity, and other aging and AD-related molecules. The role of
comorbid or mixed pathology will be assessed in AD and control brains by assessing quantitative measures of
amyloid deposits, amyloid angiopathy, neuronal and glial tau pathologies, α-synuclein pathology and TDP-43
pathology. Core C will work closely with Project 5 investigators to investigate neuropathologic phenotypes
associated with novel genetic modifiers of APOE risk, and it will develop novel assays, as needed, to study the
gene products implicated in Project 5 genetic association studies. It will assist Project 2 investigators in
histologic and neuropathologic assessment of astrocytic and microglial response to Aβ-induced local damage,
Aβ-induced tau spreading, and tau-mediated neurodegeneration in animal models. Finally, Core C will assist
investigators in Projects 3 and 4 with digital pathologic method to systematically assess markers of glial
activation and other neuropathologic measures in animal and cellular models. Core C supports individual
components of the U19 by providing neuropathology services and resources to address gaps in knowledge
with the ultimate goal of testing the ApoE Cascade Hypothesis. Core C will use cutting edge methods, such as
digital pathology and confocal microscopy, to address critical knowledge gaps in our collective efforts to
understand why APOE genotype has a profound effect on risk for AD and other ageing-related conditions. In
addition, Core C will share valuable resources (brain tissues and relevant data) with the Multi-Omics,

10850844,"PROJECT SUMMARY (APOE U19 Core D: Biomarker Core)
The overall goal of the Biomarker Core (Core D) is to conduct and support the biomarker assessments for
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and age-related cognitive decline in fluid biospecimens including plasma and
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) among Projects and Cores in the U19 program with a specific focus on APOE. Given
that APOE genotype (ε2, ε3 and ε4) has been shown to impact cognitive performances in the elderly, we
hypothesize that apolipoprotein E (apoE) biochemical property (amount, lipidation, aggregation and
post-translational modification) as well as its genotypes influence established and emerging biofluid-marker
levels for AD. We will perform longitudinal biomarker studies based on APOE genotype over a time span of 2-3
years in elderly (≥65 years old) individuals by focusing on the change of Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)
between two visits in established cohorts from Mayo Clinic and Washington University School of Medicine in St.
Louis. We will take advantage of the large sample numbers of biospecimens banked in the NIH-supported
programs including Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) and the Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (ADRC)
at both institutions. In Aim 1, we will organize the available dataset and fluid biospecimens from the cohorts. If
available, we will also integrate the biospecimens with postmortem brain samples/neuropathological information
through the Neuropathological Core (Core C) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells to generate induce
pluripotent stem cells through Project 5 and the Human iPSC Models Core (Core E). In Aim 2, we plan to
establish apoE-related fluid biomarkers for clinical dementia progression. We aim to develop apoE-targeted
biomarkers for age-related cognitive decline and AD by assessing amounts and potential post-translational
modification of apoE through LC-MS/MS approaches in plasma and CSF samples. Lipidation status and
structural properties of apoE particles will also be explored through Project 1 and the Biochemistry and Structural
Modeling Core (Core B). In Aim 3, we aim to uncover potential fluid biomarkers for clinical dementia progression
using an ‘Omics approach through the Multi-Omics Core (Core F). In Aim 4, we will generate a fluid biomarker
dataset to elucidate the effects of APOE on clinical dementia progression by measuring emerging AD-related
biomarkers for synaptic damage and glial activation, as well as inflammation/vascular biomarkers. In Aim 5, we
will support fluid biomarker measurements including apoE measurements and AD-related fluid biomarker
assessments in mouse models from Projects 2-4 and iPSC models from Project 5 upon requests. Together, this
comprehensive and innovative Biomarker Core will allow for integrated, systems-based, multidisciplinary studies
by focusing on apoE isoforms in the disease cascade for AD and age-related cognitive decline. Monitoring how
biomarkers change over time in asymptomatic and early symptomatic stages in well-phenotyped cohorts might
allow us to define the current disease phases of patients and predict clinical progression in a more precise
manner."
10850852,"PROJECT SUMMARY (APOE U19 Core F: Multi-Omics Core)
This Multi-Omics Core (Core F) aims to develop and apply state-of-the-art proteomics, metabolomics and
lipidomics technologies to investigate the mechanisms of APOE genotype on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk at
the molecular, cellular and pathogenic levels. Given the dysfunction of complex and synergistic pathways
contributes to AD heterogeneity, identifying clinically relevant molecules (DNAs, RNAs, proteins, metabolites
and lipids) is essential to predict, diagnose, treat, and prevent AD. As such, this Core seeks to develop and apply
technologies based on mass spectrometry (MS), coupled with transcriptome studies, to uncover proteomic,
metabolomic, and lipidomic changes. Omics assessments will be made directly using human tissues and
biofluids, human organoids, mouse and cell models, as well as isolated cellular compartments and protein
complexes linked to AD in an apoE isoform-dependent manner. To achieve this goal, we have assembled a
strong multidisciplinary team with established and renowned investigators in proteomics (Peng), metabolomics
(Peng) and lipidomics (Han), both having extensive expertise in studying neurodegeneration. The Core will apply
the latest proteomics, metabolomics and lipidomics strategies across U19 components, specifically Projects
2, 3, and 4, and Cores B, C, D, E, and G; the Core will also further advance these technologies to address
unmet needs of the apoE research community in the following aims: (i) develop and apply a nanoscale, 27-
plex MS-based platform for analyzing apoE-related proteome, protein modifications and protein
interactome; (ii) develop and apply untargeted and targeted metabolomics technologies with evaluation of
false discovery rate for analyzing apoE-affected metabolome; (iii) develop and apply the lipidomics
technologies to serve the apoE research community; and (iv) apply multi-omics approaches to define the
effects by APOE genotype, sex, and disease status. In summary, this Core will develop and provide the
cutting edge MS-based multi-omics approaches for discovering novel, crucial apoE-related molecules/
networks during aging and AD pathogenesis in this U19 application."
10850854,"PROJECT SUMMARY (APOE U19 Core G: Bioinformatics, Biostatistics, and Data Management Core)
The complexity of multi-omics as well as cognitive/functional data generated by the Projects and Cores in this
U19 application and the subsequent mandate for cutting-edge bioinformatics and biostatistical analyses
demand a dedicated Bioinformatics, Biostatistics, and Data Management Core (Core G).
The Projects and Cores span a wide range of analytical areas including population genetics, structural biology,
proteomics, lipidomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics, and digital pathology. As such, during the designing
stage of the proposed U19 program, the Core G worked extensively with every Project and Core team to: 1)
harmonize and standardize sample metadata between different institutions; 2) ensure consistency and
adequacy of analytic approaches across projects and cores; 3) determine optimal study design for all projects
and cores to allow rigorous testing of their proposed hypotheses; and 4) identify analytic challenges for which
novel algorithms and methods need to be developed by Core G.
Core G will coordinate and perform all U19-related study design, data QC and analytics, and data/resource
management activities. More importantly, Core G will take on the significant challenge of integrating and
interpreting multi-omics and genotypic/phenotypic data to uncover molecular mechanisms and pathways
driving age-related cognitive decline in the context of our novel ApoE Cascade Hypothesis (ACH).
Core G plays a critical role in this proposed U19 program because it acts not only as the coordinator and
synergizer between Cores and Projects to provide adequate analytic and data management support for all
other Projects and Cores, but also as an investigative team to unveil the ACH-based aging mechanism using
the multi-modalities and multi-omics datasets to be generated by the entire U19 program. Core G will ensure
database, bioinformatics, and biostatistics integrity for study design and data analyses across U19 teams, and
at the same time address the significant challenge of multi-omics data integration and interpretation by
developing novel methodologies including the state-of-art machine learning and deep learning approaches.
The Core G staff have a track record of both extensive interactions/collaborations with the entire U19 team and
independent investigations in aging and AD research, and are thus well situated to lead the database and
analytic activities of the proposed U19 program as well as the search of ACH-based aging mechanism."
10850857,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A single amino acid difference in apolipoprotein E (apoE) distinguishes each of the three major
isoforms that lead to dramatically different functional outcomes when expressed in the brain:
apoE4 contributes up to a 15 fold risk increase in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) compared to apoE3,
whereas apoE2 appears to be protective. A large amount of evidence suggests a direct role of
the protein in disease progression; yet, the isoform- dependent structural features of apoE
remain elusive, hampering our understanding of the mechanism behind apoE4 neurotoxicity.
Indeed, current structural models of apoE have been derived from a limited number of
incomplete structures obtained from protein fragments free in solution or in complex with synthetic
liposomes. Very little is known about the structure in the context of endogenously-secreted
lipoproteins. Testing the ApoE Cascade Hypothesis (ACH), the core focus of this U19 proposal,
requires overcoming these limitations and comparing the structural differences of apoE isoforms
when bound to secreted lipoproteins and AD-related pathogenic molecules such as amyloid-β
(Aβ). Here, we propose to bypass previous experimental obstacles by using an innovative
multipronged approach that combines single- molecule fluorescence spectroscopy and cryo-
electron microscopy (EM). Our approach enables accessing the conformational ensemble of
apoE in its monomeric, oligomeric, and lipid-bound forms and reveals coexistence of multiple
conformations in equilibrium, which are invisible to classical methods of structural biology. In
collaboration with Core B, single-molecule measurements, negative-stain, and cryo-EM will be
compared and interpolated with molecular dynamics simulations to reconstruct atomistic-detailed
models of the protein when bound to secreted lipoproteins and Aβ. In Aim 1, we will determine
the isoform-specific structural ensemble of apoE/lipoprotein particles obtained from human apoE
knockin mouse-derived astrocytes, microglia, and vascular mural cells (Project 2 and 4), as well
as iPSC-derived cells (Core E), cell type-specific apoE mouse models (Projects 3-4), and human
biospecimens (Core C and D). In aim 2, we will assess how the interplay between Aβ
and apoE modulate their structural ensembles and oligomerization propensity. The
proposed experiments will provide a detailed atomistic structural representation of apoE
isoforms in the context of lipoproteins and while interacting with Aβ, integrating the biochemical
characterization of Core B, and facilitating investigations of isoform-specific functional effects
conducted by Projects 2-5 and Core B-F."
10850860,"PROJECT SUMMARY (APOE U19: PROJECT 2)
 Project 2 seeks to improve understanding of how apolipoprotein E (apoE) isoforms influence glial lipid
metabolism and inflammatory responses underlying immune-mediated damage in the brain in Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) and aging-related pathologies. Evidence indicates that the apoE protein not only affects Aβ
deposition and structure, it strongly influences microglial-activation, Aβ-induced neuritic dystrophy, and tau-
mediated neurodegeneration. ApoE produced by both astrocytes and microglia plays an important role in
these effects, and microglia are critical effectors of neurodegeneration. In alignment with the ApoE Cascade
Hypothesis of this U19, we anticipate that structural differences and related biochemical properties among the
apoE isoforms are likely to mediate the differential effects of apoE on the brain’s innate immune response.
Factors such as lipid metabolism and sterol processing, can influence microglial reactivity in ways that are
relevant to AD pathogenesis. Recent evidence indicates that apoE and aging critically influence the process of
cholesterol and lipid clearance in the brain, specifically in microglia. Accumulation of lipid debris in microglia
under different conditions is linked with microglial activation and inflammasome-mediated damage. There is
also literature and we have preliminary data that 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), a known oxysterol
immunomodulator, is produced in the brain by microglia and can modulate cholesterol metabolism as well as
the microglial cytokine response in an apoE isoform-dependent manner in vitro. These data lead us to
hypothesize that apoE-dependent regulation and clearance of cholesterol esters and other lipids
specifically in microglia regulates the microglial inflammatory response in aging and AD. We further
hypothesize that this microglial response including 25HC production impacts Aβ-induced local damage, Aβ-
induced tau spreading, and tau-mediated neurodegeneration in an apoE, age, and sex-dependent fashion. We
propose these aims: Aim 1: Determine the effects of apoE and apoE isoforms on cholesterol, cholesterol
esters, and other lipids in astrocytes and microglia during aging, in the setting of Aβ and tau pathology, and
with LXR agonist stimulation. Aim 2: Assess the effects of the immunomodulatory oxysterol, 25-
hydroxycholesterol (25HC) on Aβ-mediated tau-spreading, tau-mediated neurodegeneration, and age-related
brain phenotypes and how these are modified by apoE. Aim 3: Assess the effect of apoE isoform on the
lipidomic profile of astrocytes, microglia, and secreted apoE-containing lipoproteins as well as the mechanistic
relationship between lipid droplet formation, apoE signaling, and inflammation in vitro. We will also assess the
mechanism of the effects of ch25h on apoE-mediated neurodegeneration in vitro. Impact/Integration: Project
2 will work closely with Projects 1, 3, 5, Core B, Core D, Core E, Core F, and Core G on production,
purification, and characterization of apoE particles and lipids from mouse glia in vitro and in vivo and iPSC
derived glia in vitro. Histological analysis in Project 2 will be done with the Neuropathology Core (Core C)."
10850866,"PROJECT SUMMARY (APOE U19: Project 3)
Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a major genetic determinant of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with APOE4
increases the risk and APOE2 being protective compared with common APOE3 allele. Our team-based work
will investigate a novel ApoE Cascade Hypothesis (ACH) which will shed light on the disease mechanisms and
inform future therapeutic strategies for AD. Here, Project 3 seeks to elucidate whether different isoforms of
astrocytic and microglial apoE exhibit different biochemical properties that impact its function, aggregation, and
the metabolism of amyloid-β (Aβ) during aging and AD development. In addition to astrocytes, microglia
secrete abundant lipidated apoE with aging and in the context of AD pathogenesis. The disease-associated
microglia (DAM) exhibit a conserved transcriptional signature across different AD mouse models with APOE
being one of the central hub genes. Interestingly, activated microglia have been shown to induce neurotoxic
(A1-like) reactive astrocytes in AD. However, little is known about whether apoE isoform-mediated microglia-
astrocyte interaction affects brain functions and amyloid pathologies. To address these questions, we have
generated novel inducible mouse models in which human APOE2, APOE3, or APOE4 gene is specifically
expressed in astrocytes or microglia. In Aim 1, we will analyze the effects of astrocytic or microglial apoE
isoforms on cognitive function, lipid metabolism, neuroinflammation, and vascular integrity during aging. In Aim
2, we will define the impacts of astrocytic or microglial apoE isoforms on brain function, neuroinflammation, and
the development of amyloid pathology. In Aim 3, we will determine the role of apoE isoforms in astrocyte-
microglia interaction and their association with cerebrovasculature during aging and in the context of amyloid
pathology. Using unique mouse models and innovative technologies (ie., in vivo 2-photon imaging and in vivo
microdialysis), we will comprehensively investigate how apoE isoforms in glia cells contribute to brain cognition
and amyloid pathology. More importantly, multi-disciplinary approaches will be employed by interacting with
other projects/cores: 1) The properties of apoE particles from our mouse models will be analyzed by Project 1
and Core B; 2) ApoE amounts and AD-related fluid biomarkers will be measured through Core D; 3) The
amyloid pathologies and neuroninflammation will be examined by Core C; 4) The molecular phenotypes of our
inducible apoE mouse models will be examined using multi-omics approaches (ie., proteomics, metabolomics,
lipidomics and single cell RNA sequencing), with results correlating with human studies through Cores F, G; 5)
Our data can be compared with studies from Projects 2 and 4 to further elucidate the cell type-specific effects;
and 6) Findings from mouse models can be further validated using human iPSC-derived microglia/astrocyte
models in Core E. Through multidisciplinary team with synergized expertise and resources, we will
collaboratively understand the apoE-associated disease mechanisms in aging-related conditions and AD."
10850870,"PROJECT SUMMARY (APOE U19: Project 4)
While the major function of apolipoprotein E (apoE) is to mediate the lipid transport, APOE genotype (APOE2,
APOE3 and APOE4) significantly influences cognitive function and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis
through multiple pathways. APOE is associated with not only amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology but also cerebrovascular
function including blood-brain barrier integrity and cerebral blood flow. Given that cerebrovascular disturbance
substantially contributes to cognitive decline in the elderly and that apoE is abundantly expressed in vascular
mural cells (smooth muscle cells and pericytes) as well as astrocytes and microglia in the brain, the overall goal
of Project 4 is to define how APOE genotype in vascular mural cells impacts the molecular mechanisms and
pathways in the development of cerebrovascular dysregulations and cognitive decline during aging and AD. In
Aim 1, we will utilize novel mouse models, in which human APOE2, APOE3, or APOE4 gene is expressed upon
an excision of a loxp-flanked STOP cassette by vascular mural cell specific sm22α promoter driven Cre
expression to determine the effects of vascular mural cell-specific expression of apoE isoforms on
cerebrovascular function and brain cognition during aging. In Aim 2, we will define the impact of apoE isoform
deletion in vascular mural cells on age-related cerebrovascular dysfunction and cognitive decline using novel
APOE knock-in mice, in which murine Apoe is replaced with floxed APOE2, APOE3, or APOE4 gene. By
crossing with sm22α-Cre mice, we will specifically delete individual apoE isoforms in vascular mural cells. In Aim
3, we will examine how vascular-specific expression or deletion of apoE isoforms in conditional mouse models
affects AD-related phenotypes by breeding the vascular mural cell-specific apoE isoform expressing or knockout
mice with amyloid model APP knockin mice (AppNL-F/NL-F). Using those unique mouse models, we will
comprehensively investigate how apoE isoforms in vascular mural cells impact cerebrovascular function, glial
phenotypes, neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, brain cognition and amyloid pathology at different ages. In
particular, the apoE properties in the mouse models will be analyzed by the Biochemistry and Structural
Modeling Core (Core B). ApoE amounts, oxidation and/or glycation in the mice as well as other AD-rerated fluid
biomarkers will be measured through the Biomarker Core (Core D). While neuropathology in the mice will be
investigated in Neuropathology Core (Core C), a multi-Omics approach including proteomics, metabolomics,
lipidomics and single cell RNA sequencing will be carried out through the Multi-Omics Core (Core F) and
Bioinformatics, Biostatistics, and Data Management Core (Core G) to profile molecular phenotypes in these
mouse models. Together, our innovative study should fill a critical void in our understanding of how apoE
isoforms in cerebrovasculature impact cellular functions and brain homeostasis during aging and AD through
synergistic interaction with Core B-G and comparative mouse model studies by Project 2 and Project 3."

Centrosomes nucleate microtubule arrays and act as force-coordinating centers to
position nuclei and segregate chromosomes, which are essential activities during early
embryogenesis and neural development. While much is understood about the regulation
of centrosome number, much less is known about molecular mechanisms determining
centrosome size, microtubule nucleation capacity, and resistance to forces. The goal of
this proposal is to reveal how molecular-level interactions between centrosome proteins
determine the activity, emergent material properties, and ultrastructure of PCM, the most
substantial layer of a centrosome.
I hypothesize that PCM is an amorphous hydrogel whose material state (e.g., strength,
elasticity) is regulated by phospho-tunable connections between coiled-coil scaffolding
proteins. I further hypothesize that fine-tuning of scaffold structure and material properties
regulates PCM size, activity, and resistance to microtubule-dependent pulling forces. I
propose to test these hypotheses using two innovative techniques that I recently
developed: a minimal PCM reconstitution system and an optical method to perform nano-
rheology of PCM in living embryos. In addition, I propose to develop in-cell cryo-electron
tomography to visualize PCM ultrastructure with sub-10 nm resolution. These
experiments are designed to 1) identify the minimal components needed to generate
consistently sized, fully active PCM, 2) discover key regulators and material design
principles that allow PCM to resist microtubule-pulling forces, and 3) generate the highest-
resolution structural atlas of native centrosomes to date. This proposal is significant
because it will illuminate how centrosome function is determined and regulated at the
molecular level, which will provide mechanistic insight into human disorders caused by
centrosome dysfunction, such as microcephaly, primordial dwarfism, and various
cancers."

mortality,1-7 cardiovascular disease,8-12 diabetes,13-16 and cancers of the breast17-19 and colon,20-23 as well as
energy balance.24 However, only 54% of U.S. adults meet national guidelines of expending > 1000 kcals/week
through PA,25 and as few as 10% meet guidelines when objective assessments of PA are used.26 Thus, there
is a need to improve adherence to PA programs using innovative approaches. Economic incentives have been
shown to be powerful motivators for behavior change and for improving health outcomes.28-37 While there is
evidence suggesting the general efficacy of incentive programs for increasing PA,38 research has not yet
demonstrated the optimal format for incentive programs. Nonetheless, spurred by organizational incentives
(i.e., tax breaks) provided by the Affordable Health Care Act, major insurance companies are now offering
economic incentives for regular attendance at fitness facilities in the absence of empirical support. Thus, we
propose to conduct an RCT to examine the efficacy of the exercise incentive program currently offered by
three major US insurance companies39-41 consisting of a $200 rebate on fitness facility membership fees for at
least 50 confirmed visits to the fitness facility (maximum 1/day, verified by objective swipe-card data) over 6
months. In the context of the RCT, we will also compare the insurance-based standard incentive program to a
second, loss-frame incentive condition in which the same incentive schedule is used, but with participants told
(and reminded during the course of the program) that $200 of their membership fee is being held and will be
returned or forfeited depending on whether they use the gym at least 50 times in the next 6 months. The
proposed RCT will be conducted in a community setting at the Greater Providence YMCAs. Aim 1. Conduct an
RCT (N=330) comparing (a) the widely used insurance-based Standard incentives program (n=110), (b) a
Loss-framed incentive program (n=110), and (c) no-incentive Control (n=110). Each participant will be enrolled
for two consecutive 6-month periods for a total of 12 months per participant. The primary outcome will be
number of visits to the fitness facility. Secondary outcomes will include total moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA)
over 7-day periods at 3-month intervals through accelerometers and self-reported MVPA. We hypothesize that
the two incentive conditions will result in higher attendance at the YMCA and more PA, with the Loss-framed
incentive program outperforming the Standard insurance-based program. Aim 2. Examine habit formation and
anticipated regret as putative mediators and household income and age as moderators of the incentive-based
programs. Aim 3. Conduct a within trial cost-utility analysis from a societal perspective to quantify (a) the
incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, (b) cost per change in YMCA attendance, and
(c) cost per incremental change in PA. We will additionally apply a productivity model to estimate the economic
impact of the intervention on future household and labor force participation."

Dr. Wagahta Semere’s long-term career goal is to be an independent clinician-investigator and leader in
developing and implementing technology-based communication interventions to engage caregivers for diverse
patients in effective and safe chronic disease care. She has identified engaging caregivers in diabetes
management as a critical issue to achieve this goal. This proposal describes her comprehensive 5-year
program of training and mentored research. The work proposed is aligned with AHRQ’s Division of Digital
Healthcare Research mission to explore how the evolving digital healthcare ecosystem can best advance the
quality, safety, and effectiveness of healthcare for patients and their families and addresses several AHRQ
Priority Populations (women, elderly, racial/ethnic minorities, low income, and chronic illness groups). While Dr.
Semere has a strong background in health services research, this K08 will provide key training in large data
analytics, qualitative and mixed methods research, and implementation science. Communication in chronic
illness care that leads to shared understanding has been linked to improved adherence, better disease control,
and safer outcomes. Patient portals—systems that allow patients convenient access to their health information
online and the ability to exchange secure messages (SM) with providers—offer an ideal communication
platform to achieve shared understanding and better outcomes in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Caregivers acting as
proxies, messaging on patients’ behalf, can enable and expand the ability of patients to engage with providers
via SM platforms. Yet, proxies largely remain an untapped resource, especially for racial/ethnic minorities and
those with communication barriers, who may benefit most from proxy involvement. The proposed specific aims
are (1) to determine the independent effect of patient use of caregiver proxies for secure messaging (SM) on
clinical outcomes among T2D patients with and without proxies, (2) to compare the characteristics of SM
exchange between T2D patients and their PCPs among patients who do and do not use caregiver proxies, and
(3) to develop and test a pilot intervention in the safety-net setting to engage caregivers in SM to promote
effective communication and safe disease management for T2D patients. Dr. Semere’s mentorship team is led
by Dr. Schillinger and includes nationally recognized health services researchers, communication scientists,
qualitative and mixed methods experts, and implementation scientists who together will provide practical
guidance to complement her didactic training. In addition, the supportive research environments at UCSF and
within the Division of General Internal Medicine at Zuckerberg San Francisco General, will enable her to
achieve the proposed project aims. Upon completion of the proposed research and training, Dr. Semere will
submit a competitive R-level grant application to test the pilot intervention in a randomized trial across several
safety-net clinics. She will possess the skills and experience to make impactful contributions to patient quality
and safety in chronic disease through evidence-based and family-centered communication interventions."
10768540,"Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease that is endemic to Latin America, but is increasingly being
detected in the United States. Chagas disease is caused by the Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) parasite and
presents itself in two phases: an acute phase and chronic phase. The diagnosis of both phases is challenging
as patients can be asymptomatic or have nonspecific symptoms. If untreated, acute infection progresses to a
chronic phase where 20 ‒ 40% of patients will develop life-threatening illness, including cardiomyopathy, heart
failure and cardiac arrest.
 Acute infection can be detected by microscopy; however, the level of parasitemia during chronic infection
drops below the limit of detection of this technique, making it unsuitable for diagnosis. Therefore, the diagnosis
of chronic infection relies mainly on serological detection of anti-T. cruzi antibodies, which can persist in the
blood throughout the life of the infected individual. However, existing serological tests are prone to inconclusive
or false-negative/positive results due to inadequacies of the native T. cruzi capture proteins used in these assays
and differences in the seven T. cruzi discrete typing units (DTUs) subtypes. For these reasons, the WHO and
PAHO recommends testing using at least two different serological techniques for diagnosing Chagas infection.
In the United States, discordant results obtained from these two tests require the sample to be forwarded to the
CDC for additional testing to confirm diagnosis. This repetitive testing process imposes a significant resource
burden on the healthcare system and the poor performance of existing Chagas serological tests can lead to
increased disease transmission and life-threatening illness due to misdiagnosis. Therefore, the objective of this
project is to develop a serological test that can accurately detect all geographical variances of T. cruzi infection.
This assay will employ a collection of carefully designed recombinant T. cruzi antigens for highly specific
detection of all T. cruzi subtypes while exhibiting no cross-reactivity with other pathogens. The rationale for the
proposed research is supported by the applicants’ preliminary data demonstrating the generation of a
recombinant T. cruzi antigen (Tc24) that can accurately detect anti-T. cruzi IgG in human sera from multiple
Chagas-endemic countries and highly sensitive detection of anti-T. cruzi IgG in human sera using a magneto
immunoassay prototype. To achieve this goal, we will pursue the following specific aims:
 1) Identify a collection of recombinant antigens for detecting all T. cruzi subtypes with high specificity;
 2) Develop a magneto immunoassay for high sensitivity and specificity detection of T. cruzi.
This approach is innovative because it combines the use of a collection of carefully designed recombinant T.
cruzi antigens for detecting all geographic subtypes of T. cruzi while exhibiting no cross-reactivity with other
parasites with a sensitive magneto immunoassay, and it is significant because it will improve the diagnosis of
patients with chronic Chagas disease, thus helping to reduce disease-related morbidity and mortality."
10840965,"Six million Americans suffer from atrial fibrillation (AF), a heart rhythm abnormality that is a major risk factor
for stroke. Despite this, only half of eligible AF patients receive anticoagulation (AC) treatment. The gap in AC
use is even larger for African-Americans with their use ranging 10-22% less compared to Whites and
Hispanics. Storytelling is one promising patient facing intervention to promoting initiation of and persistence
with AC in African-American patients. According to the Slater Model of Narrative Communication, two
constructs facilitate behavior change. They include homophily, or identification with the characters in a
storytelling narrative, and transportation, or absorption into a story line. Using this model, we posit that a
patient not on AC watching stories of patients who initiated or resumed AC after hesitancy or setback will
develop more accurate risk perception, increased belief in AC benefit, and decreased perceived barriers to
using AC. Through story development groups (focus groups geared to identify compelling stories and star
storytellers) of African-American patients, we will generate material for a storytelling intervention. We then
propose to conduct a pilot and feasibility trial of the storytelling intervention with African-American patients
who are not adherent to AC. In the trial, we will assess intervention fidelity and transportation, measure
recruitment and retention, and follow trends in initiation and persistence with AC that will inform a larger trial.
Specific Aims. Aim 1: (Story Development) In accordance with the Adapted Slater and Health Belief
models, develop a storytelling intervention for promoting initiation of and persistence with AC among African
American patients. Aim 1a: (Selection of Storytellers and Stories) Convene story development groups with
patients from our two study sites (n=33 total). In these groups, we will inquire about patients’ experiences with
initiation of and persistence with AC; through this inquiry, we will identify initiation/persistence challenges,
compelling stories which illustrate these challenges, and adaptive coping strategies used by patients and
“star” storytellers. Aim 1b: (Filming Stories) Create an interview guide to re-elicit the most compelling
stories from each star storyteller (n=10) in greater detail and then conduct individual videotaped interviews
with each star. Aim 1c: (Video analysis and rating) Conduct thematic analysis of the videotaped interview
to identify key story units; a patient advisory panel will rate the units to identify those which will make it into
final videos. Aim 2 (Randomized trial) – Assign eligible patients in 1:1 ratio to watch intervention vs. control
videos (comparison, didactic videos without stories). Eligible patients include African-American patients with
AF not on AC but recommended to use AC in the past one year (n=40; 20 intervention and 20 control
patients). Aims 2a: (Fidelity and transportation) Measure time spent viewing videos; in intervention
patients, measure transportation (absorption into story) using an established instrument. Aim 2b:
(Feasibility, acceptability; manual of operations) Measure recruitment and retention rates; measure
usability of video website and burdensomeness of completing research instruments. Also develop of a
manual of operations preparing for future R01 of comparative effectiveness. Aim 2c: (Video testing on
behavior change) Measure trends in the initiation of AC and persistence with AC in the 6 months following
randomization."
10834237,"PROJECT SUMMARY The studies proposed in this application will advance in vitro safety and efficiency testing for somatic cell genome editing in human cells in 3D organoid models. For genome editing, human organoids have the potential to be an ideal tool, as the therapeutic target is the human genome, which cannot be replicated in any other species. Organoids also have advantages for throughput and predictivity of human side effects. It is important, however, to test the utility and value of organoids in this context, for this to be demonstrated as an enabling technology for investigational new drugs. To achieve this, we will produce a set of diverse organoids representing human kidney, liver, brain, lung, retina, and/or heart as vital organ systems of great interest to gene editing applications. For each organ lineage in our 'body in a dish', we will demonstrate assays to measure editing rates as well as side effects. These assays will be optimized to establish reference standards with quantifiable measurements of assay stability, reproducibility, and analytical range. Organoid datasets will be compared with datasets produced in parallel efforts by collaborating teams using similar gene editing technologies. The objective is to demonstrate safety and efficiency assays in human organoid cultures in conjunction with complementary assessments in other systems as a tractable paradigm to support the advancement of genome editing therapeutics to human clinical trials. To maximize impact, we will focus on assays that will be broadly useful for a wide variety of genome editing therapeutics, in multiple organ systems. Organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells possess many key features of tissues, including diverse cell types in sophisticated arrangements, and express specific disease phenotypes associated with rare populations. For regulatory consideration, there is a critical need to determine their fidelity and prediction capacity. In these studies, we will demonstrate concordance and synergy between human organoids and other preclinical models. Thus, the Specific Aim proposed is to de-risk therapeutic genome editing approaches by assessing dose-dependent efficiency with adverse events in human organoids. Collectively, these studies will produce models of genome editing in human organoids with outcomes that can be compared to orthologous models to establish a regulatory paradigm which can be applied to a range of tissues and diseases."
10782547,"Project Summary/Abstract
To prevent or limit infection, upon sensing foreign nucleic acids (e.g., viral RNA) interferon (IFN) is produced and
elicits a potent innate immune response orchestrated by hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes. However, cells face
several challenges when attempting to differentiate between foreign and self nucleic acids. For instance, cells
often produce double-stranded RNAs (dsRNA) that can be mistakenly recognized as foreign and lead to
autoimmunity. This is exemplified by the fact that naturally occurring mutations in an RNA-editing enzyme called
ADAR1 (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1) cause an autoinflammatory disorder named Aicardi-Goutières
syndrome characterized by an aberrant IFN response in the absence of infection. In addition to this link to
autoimmunity, recent studies have demonstrated that depleting ADAR1 sensitizes tumor cells to innate or
therapy-induced immune responses and ADAR1 may therefore be a promising target for anti-cancer therapies.
Unfortunately, there is a gap in our basic understanding of how ADAR1 enables cells to differentiate self from
non-self RNAs. With this grant, we aim to address this knowledge gap.
 ADAR1 belongs to a family of proteins that modifies adenosines (A) to inosines (I) on dsRNA. These A-
to-I modifications, through an unknown mechanism, prevent the sensing of dsRNAs by receptor proteins
including PKR (protein kinase R), which normally triggers translational inhibition and cell death. It has been
speculated that these modifications alter the secondary structures of dsRNAs and prevent them from activating
PKR. However, ADAR1 frequently targets unpaired adenosine bases, and therefore A-to-I conversion is unlikely
to cause major disruption to dsRNA structures. Here, we propose a novel hypothesis that one or more unknown
RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are involved in differentiating ADAR1-edited vs. unedited dsRNAs. This RBP may
preferentially bind to inosine-containing RNAs and prevent them from activating PKR.
 We will use a combination of genome-wide and high-coverage RBP-targeted CRISPR knockout screens
to identify protein factors, which together with ADAR1, prevent self RNA from triggering immune responses and
cell death. We will evaluate potential hits using a semi-arrayed siRNA library and include additional readouts
such as PKR activation and IFN production to prioritize candidates for further investigation. Lastly, we will initiate
preliminary mechanistic studies to determine their RNA interactions and potential protein interactions with
ADAR1 and PKR. This work will lay the foundation for future detailed mechanistic studies.
 In conclusion, our proposal has the potential to open new avenues of research to understand the
biological functions and importance of inosines within RNA. Our study may reveal novel and paradigm-shifting
mechanistic insights into how cells differentiate self vs. non-self RNA. It will also provide critical information for
developing ADAR1-based cancer immunotherapies."

Chronic stress is a detrimental condition affecting brain physiology, cognition and mental health. Altered
cerebrovascular network has long been recognized as a potential modulator of neuronal function in response to
stress. However, key molecular substrates conveying signals from cerebrovascular input to functional pathways
in specific types of neurons are not fully understood. Our recent study with a chronic social defeat stress (CSDS)
paradigm indicates that a) hippocampal parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons are a determinant of CSDS-
induced behavioral adaptations, b) hemoglobin (Hb) α- and β-chain levels are drastically upregulated in
hippocampal PV neurons in stress-susceptible mice, and c) mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in PV
neurons is the most significant functional pathway associated with stress susceptibility. Because chronic stress
is known to cause cerebrovascular dysfunction and dysregulated blood flow in the brain, we hypothesize that PV
interneurons are a contiguous target of chronic stress, and Hb expressed in PV neurons is a critical node sensing
vascular input and regulating mitochondrial adaptation in PV neurons. The overarching goal of this study is to
establish a cell-type-specific deletion model of Hb and determine the role of Hb in chronic stress-induced PV
neuron adaptation and behavioral responses to chronic stress. First, we will use the CSDS model, and examine
the effect of an antihypertensive drug (captopril) on CSDS-induced microbleeds, BBB disruption, Hb induction
in PV neurons and behavioral outcomes to determine the relationship between vascular disruption and Hb
induction in PV neurons (Aim 1a). Hippocampal PV neuron-selective deletion of Hb β-chain genes will be
achieved by injecting AAV-sgRNAs vector into the hippocampus of transgenic mice expressing Cas9 selectively
in PV neurons. The control and β-chain-deleted mice will be subjected to CSDS, and behavioral responses to
CSDS will be measured (Aim 1b). After behavioral assays, the hippocampal tissues will be analyzed using a PV-
neuron-selective Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP)/RNA-seq approach (Aim 2). Differentially
expressed genes (DEGs) will be analyzed by bioinformatic approaches to find altered functional pathways
including mitochondrial pathways (Aim 2). We aim to determine whether neuronal Hb is required for chronic
stress-induced behavioral changes (Aim 1b) and identify downstream genes and functional pathways influenced
by Hb deletion (Aim 2). Cell-type-specific deletion tools for neuronal Hb in conjunction with a cell-type-specific
TRAP/RNA-seq approach established in this study can be applicable to the future studies of Hb in other cell
types in different brain regions under various stress or disease models. The research paradigm established in
this study will facilitate an array of new studies paving the gap between stress-induced cerebrovascular deficit
and brain-cell-type-specific responses. Thus, the outcome of the proposed research could yield a broad impact
on the fields of mental health and brain disorders."

Psychiatric disorders are among the most common illnesses across the lifespan, with more than 75% of
individuals developing symptoms beginning in adolescence. Most psychiatric disorders include aspects of
cognitive dysfunctions that have been suggested to predispose individuals to develop the psychiatric conditions
and may serve as early markers of subsequent illness. Cognitive deficits and behavioral disturbances were
indicated to be related to broad-based functional impairments across disorders, which traditional case-control
studies are hard to capture. Following the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative launched by NIMH, there
is an urgent need for developing biomarkers that can cross current diagnostic boundaries and drive new ways
of defining psychiatric disorders based on dimensions of behavioral and neurobiological measures. In this project,
we will quantify functional connectivity biomarkers that capture brain dysfunctions spanning multiple psychiatric
disorders for an improved understanding of cognitive deficits and psychopathology. With high-density
electroencephalography (EEG), we will quantify connectivity biomarkers predictive of individual cognitive
behavior across the diagnostic spectrum (Aim 1). We will build a robust prediction model by combining relevance
vector machine and connectome-based predictive modeling to identify transdiagnostic neural circuits that map
the connectivity features to individual cognitive deficits. In Aim 2, we will design a dimensional approach based
on multiway canonical correlation analysis to robustly reveal neural circuit-correlated dimensions of
psychopathology. This approach allows us to jointly identify brain dysfunctions and dimensional behavioral
phenotypes. We will evaluate these tools and compare the obtained results between EEG and fMRI using a
large-scale transdiagnostic database from Healthy Brain Network. The proposed research will lead to an
innovative and generalizable solution for the robust quantification of transdiagnostic EEG connectivity
biomarkers that predict individual cognitive ability and delineate dimensions of psychopathological behavior
across psychiatric disorders. Successful outcomes of the project will produce translatable biomarkers crossing
current diagnostic boundaries in line with the goals of RDoC and provide a new avenue for EEG connectivity-
based transdiagnostic study of psychopathology, thereby representing an important step towards the
development of personalized therapeutics for improved mental health. We will release the developed tools to be
publicly available to facilitate other transdiagnostic neuroimaging studies in psychiatry."
10835109,"Developing a robust method for analyzing transcription factor mediated chromatin interactions
Transcription factors (TFs) mediate the interactions between distal regulatory elements and gene promoters
to control specific gene expression; disruption of this process by mutations in the protein coding regions or
the non-coding DNA binding sites of TFs could lead to dysregulation of transcription and human diseases. An
increasing number of genomics tools (such as Hi-C) have been developed for mapping long range chromatin
interactions. What is missing in these DNA-centric approaches are TFs and their cofactors, although
bioinformatics approaches have been developed to infer the roles of TFs in chromatin interactions. Current
technologies (such as HiChIP) for mapping protein-mediated chromatin interactions have worked well with
high abundance proteins but not for most TFs. This is largely due to the high variability and low efficiency of
antibodies used in the immunoprecipitation of chromatin complexes associated with the TF of interest. The
introduction of in situ biotinylated TFs has greatly improved the sensitivity and reproducibility of ChIP-seq
(a.k.a biochip-seq), but this strategy cannot be extended to the mapping of TF-mediated chromatin
interactions. This is because all Hi-C based mapping techniques, including HiChIP, use biotinylated
nucleotide to label the ligation junction to enrich contact signals. Consequently, streptavidin binding would
pull down all chromatin contacts indiscriminately. To overcome this problem, the proposed studies aim to
develop a new method for mapping TF-mediated chromatin interaction by adapting the HiChIP protocol to
biotinylated TFs (referred to as bioHiChIP) (Aim 1) and test the application of bioHiChIP in mapping
chromatin interactions mediated by biotinylated FOXP3 (Aim 2). The bioHiChIP is designed to be a simple
and easy-to-operate protocol for robust mapping of protein-mediated chromatin interactions. It will serve as a
powerful tool for the broad research community to take advantage of the increasing research resources of
transgenic model organisms with biotinylated TFs to study the detailed mechanisms of transcription
regulation in physiological functions and pathological diseases."
10934329,"ABSTRACT
 Pregnancy is a complex state that involves immune crosstalks between maternal cells in the decidua and
fetal cells. This communication plays an important role in protecting the fetus from rejection. Extravillous
trophoblasts (EVTs) are critical fetal cells that shape the immunological microenvironment at the maternal-fetal
(M-F) interface. EVTs express a unique set of major histocompatibility complex (MHC I) molecules on their
surfaces: the classical HLA-C and non-classical HLA-E, -F, and -G molecules. Quite exceptionally, EVTs do
not express HLA-A and HLA-B. HLA-C, -E, and -G molecules have been associated with mechanisms of
immune tolerance at the M-F interface, and whether HLA-F functions similarly is less well understood. HLA-F is
unique among MHC I molecules in several ways: 1. HLA-F exists in more than one molecular form, with and
without associated peptides and b2m; 2. HLA-F binds peptides that are unconventionally long, ranging from
8mers to more than 20mers; and 3. Inhibitory and activating receptors on natural killer (NK) cells can
distinguish between peptide-filled and peptide-deficient HLA-F molecules. It is therefore logical to propose that
a role for HLA-F in M-F immune crosstalks involves interactions between HLA-F expressed on EVTs and NK
receptors on decidual NK cells. This is reinforced by the knowledge that HLA-F expression on EVTs is most
abundant in early pregnancy, and that NK cells constitute the largest population of maternal immune cells in
the decidua during the first trimester of pregnancy. Thus, to develop an understanding of how HLA-F functions
as an immunoregulatory molecule, it is critical that we have a strong understanding of the peptide binding
properties of HLA-F and the mechanisms by which peptides modulate interactions with NK cell receptors. This
R21 application is an early-stage investigation that aims to fill unresolved gaps in our knowledge of HLA-F
immunobiology. In two aims, we propose to examine the unique landscape of HLA-F peptides in relation to
specialized aminopeptidases that normally generate MHC I immunopeptidomes inside cells, as well as address
key questions centered on why HLA-F presents peptides of extraordinarily long lengths, what biochemical and
structural properties of HLA-F support binding of long peptides, and what is the role of peptides in modulating
HLA-F interaction with NK cells. For this, we will use a combination of cell-based, biochemical, and structural
approaches. Upon completion of this project, we will have generated new knowledge on HLA-F that will help
understand how its expression on EVTs and engagement with receptors on decidual NK cells, can support a
critical regulatory role in immune crosstalks during the early stages of pregnancy. Given that pregnancy
complications are often associated with a loss of immune tolerance mechanisms, a characterization of HLA-F
as proposed here is important for stimulating new ideas in managing and decreasing the risks associated with
such complications."

Addictive psychostimulants such as amphetamine act at dopamine synapses in the striatum. Presynaptic
amphetamine action drives dopamine release via activity-dependent and activity-independent mechanisms.
Dopamine acts on multiple dopamine receptors that are differentially distributed on striatal neurons. Beyond
this volume transmission, dopamine neurons engage in synaptic transmission that is operative on a fast time
scale, compared to volume transmission, and involves not only dopamine, but also GABA and glutamate. This
project focuses on these synaptic connections as a novel substrate for psychostimulant action. The synaptic
transmission exerts excitatory effects through dopamine D1 receptors, ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate
receptors, and inhibitory effects through dopamine D2 receptors and GABAA receptors. While dopaminergic
and GABAergic synaptic connections are widespread, glutamatergic connections are concentrated in the
medial nucleus accumbens and the anterior lateral dorsal striatum. Synaptic connections to cholinergic
interneurons are the strongest, most complex, involving dopamine, GABA and glutamate. Remarkably
glutamate cotransmission is abrogated by amphetamine administration, and abrogation of glutamate
cotransmission attenuates psychostimulant responsiveness. The guiding hypothesis is that amphetamine-
induced plasticity of a subset of dopamine neuron synapses is critical for driving the striatal circuitry towards
the addicted state, particularly dopamine neuron synapses distinguished by glutamate cotransmission. The
three specific aims are to: <1> Determine quantitatively amphetamine-induced plasticity of dopamine neuron
synaptic connections to cholinergic interneurons in striatal subregions identified by synaptic connectivity-based
clustering. <2> Determine direct synaptic effects of amphetamine on dopamine neuron synaptic transmission
in striatal subregions distinguished by glutamate cotransmission. <3> Determine amphetamine effects on
dopamine neuron terminal activity during amphetamine-induced behaviors. This project will advance
understanding of the synaptic substrate of amphetamine action in the striatum, revealing loci of drug-induced
plasticity that will inform the pharmacotherapy of addiction."

 Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths around the world.
Many environmental risk factors and over 200 genetic risk variants have been identified for this complex,
multifactorial disease. However, despite the strong biological rationale for the importance and abundance of
gene-environment (GxE) interactions, the extent to which environmental risk factors (broadly defined here as
lifestyle, diet, obesity, drug use and intermediate biomarkers) modulate genetic risk factors is poorly understood.
To achieve the promise of precision prevention, we urgently need to gain a deeper understanding of GxE
interactions in CRC risk. Understanding which modifiable risk factors modulate genetic risk, which is fixed,
provides biological insights and actionable targets for new prevention intervention strategies. To accelerate the
discovery of GxE interactions in CRC risk and to take an important next step towards translation, we propose a
comprehensive innovative approach that combines single-cell multi-omics data, individual-level harmonized
epidemiological and clinical data, and genome-wide data from large, well-characterized, diverse study
populations, with novel computational and statistical approaches. Dramatic improvements in single-cell
multimodal omics technologies, combined with new computational tools based on powerful deep-learning
modeling approaches now allow us to predict the impact of genetic variants on gene regulation in a cell-type-
specific holistic manner. Because simultaneously measured single-cell gene expression (scRNA-seq) and
chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) data for normal colorectal mucosa tissue is lacking for racially and ethnically
diverse samples with detailed assessment of environmental risk factors, we propose in Aim 1 to generate such
data for 50 individuals. This resource, together with other single cell multi-omics compendia for colorectal tissue
(like HTAN), will be leveraged to develop functional prediction scores for genetic variants across the genome. In
Aim 2, we will use these functional prediction scores to boost statistical power for discovery of novel GxE
interactions. We will perform genome-wide GxE scans in over 230,000 racially and ethnically diverse CRC cases
and controls across key environmental risk factors, including obesity, diabetes, smoking, alcohol, drug use,
dietary factors and intermediate biomarkers linked to metabolic dysregulation and chronic inflammation. To
expand the number of key risk factors we can evaluate, we will utilize existing genetic instruments. In Aim 3, we
will comprehensively characterize and translate GxE interactions. To do so, we will stratify GxE findings by
clinical factors, including age of onset, racial and ethnic group, sex, and tumor subtypes. Additionally, we will
incorporate GxE interactions and genetically predicted biomarkers in a comprehensive trans-ancestral risk
prediction model to improve prediction and provide actionable information to reduce the burden of CRC. Our
community advisors have stressed the importance of including the interplay between genetic and environmental
risk factors in risk prediction modeling to enhance the acceptance of risk prediction models in the community."

Breast cancer is the second most common cancer among women in the U.S., with most cases diagnosed
among postmenopausal women at an early and treatable stage. The majority of tumors are hormone-receptor
positive and patients receive adjuvant endocrine treatment with aromatase inhibitors (AI) to prolong disease-
free survival and time-to-recurrence. Unfortunately, AI-associated musculoskeletal symptoms (AIMSS) such
as joint pain and muscle stiffness/achiness is a common side-effect of AIs, which causes approximately one-
fourth of patients discontinue their therapy. The precise mechanisms of AIMSS are unknown and no
therapies are approved for prevention or treatment. There is clearly an urgent need to identify and validate
novel targets to facilitate development of new treatments that are effective and safe. This proposal focuses
on a promising target: the sphingosine-1-phosphate type-1 receptor (S1PR1). Our preliminary data suggest
for the first time that S1P contributes to AIMSS-related effects produced by repeated oral administration of
letrozole, a widely used AI, in female mice. Letrozole treatment increased levels of S1P in the lumbar spinal
cord in female ovariectomized mice. Furthermore, letrozole-induced AIMSS-related symptoms were
completely absent in conditional null mice lacking S1PR1 in CNS cell lineages compared to control mice.
The effect of FTY720, which is an FDA-approved S1PR1/3/4/5 agonist prodrug, was then assessed as a
potential treatment in our model. Oral FTY720 administration reversed letrozole-induced pain-like behaviors
and functional impairment in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Treatment with FTY720 also rapidly
desensitized S1PR1 signaling in the CNS, suggesting a functional antagonist mechanism of action.
Collectively, our preliminary results suggest that S1PR1 represents a promising novel target for the treatment
of AIMSS. This project will test the central hypothesis that S1PR1 activation, mainly in astrocytes, contributes
to letrozole-induced AIMSS-related symptoms and that competitive or functional antagonism of S1PR1
alleviates these effects. Aim 1 will determine whether competitive antagonism of S1PR1 will alleviate and
prevent letrozole-induced AIMSS-related symptoms. Aim 2 will determine whether the S1PR1-selectively
agonist, ponesimod, will functionally antagonize SPR1 by desensitization or downregulation of S1PR1 in the
CNS to alleviate and prevent AIMSS symptoms. We will also ensure that these S1PR1 ligands do not
interfere with the anti-aromatase activity of letrozole in in vitro and in vivo breast cancer models. Aim 3 will
determine the role of S1PR1 in specific cell types (astrocytes, neurons, and microglia/macrophages) in
letrozole-induced AIMSS. Overall, this project aims to elucidate the target receptor type, cell type(s) and
pharmacological mechanism responsible for S1PR1 modulator-induced reversal of AIMSS, thereby providing
a rationale for development of S1PR1-based medications to treat this side effect of cancer adjuvant
treatment."

Natural killer (NK) cells are cytotoxic innate lymphocytes that protect the host against viruses. Newborns and
immunocompromised individuals lacking NK cells and are extremely susceptible to viral infection, including
herpesviruses such as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). HCMV can be accurately modeled using mouse
cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection in mice, which represents a robust system for investigating antiviral NK cell
responses. From the previous R01 funding period, my lab has discovered new cellular and molecular
mechanisms underlying NK cell responses against MCMV. This current R01 renewal seeks to understand the
transcriptomic, epigenetic, and metabolic control of the antiviral NK cell response, with studies centering around
a novel role for the transcription factor IRF4. In exciting preliminary data, we find IRF4 is rapidly induced in NK
cells during MCMV infection and plays a critical role in their effector response. For the proposed experiments,
we have generated new transgenic mice with conditional Irf4 ablation. In Aim 1, we will determine how IRF4 is
transcriptionally and epigenetically regulated in activated NK cells, and test how IRF4-deficiency impacts the
function of NK cells against MCMV infection. Aim 2 will identify novel gene targets and binding partners of IRF4
in NK cells by integrating transcriptomic, epigenetic, and proteomic approaches. In Aim 3, we will investigate
whether IRF4 drives antiviral NK cell responses by controlling overall metabolism and mitochondrial health.
Altogether, the studies in this R01 renewal will advance our understanding of the molecular basis by which these
powerful effector cells can mediate protection against pathogen invasion, and establish innovative clinical
paradigms for how NK cells may be harnessed for therapeutic strategies against infectious disease."
10876500,"Abstract:
Mounting evidence indicates that lineage decisions are controlled by local structures that support differentiation
in distinct regions of the bone marrow. Our ability to manipulate hematopoiesis to treat disease has been
hampered by our lack of understanding of these anatomical cues.
We have found that HPC are regionally organized in the BM and that progenitors and immature cells belonging
to the same lineage segregate to different sinusoids. We have also found that there is regional organization to
CSF1 production and that specific BM vessels are critical sources of CSF1 that regulate MDP, monocytes and
dendritic cells but not HSC or macrophages. The central hypothesis is that different subsets of sinusoids
function as assembly lines or hubs that organize and maintain different hematopoietic lineages through the
production of lineage-specific cytokines. We want to understand how these cellular assembly lines function in
the steady-state and after perturbation by acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
We will test this hypothesis in two aims. In Aim 1 we will determine the physiology of these assembly lines
using clonal fate mapping in situ; identifying the components of each assembly line; and conditionally deleting
specific cytokines from key components of each assembly line. In Aim 2 we will investigate how AML inhibits
normal hematopoiesis by perturbing the microenvironment that supports each assembly line."
10848403,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death among U.S. men and women. Racial
disparities in CRC survival exist, where the CRC mortality rate for African Americans is 40% higher than the
mortality rate for non-Hispanic white Americans. Evidence suggests there may be racial differences in intrinsic
CRC tumor biology. We hypothesize that the molecular profile of CRC tumors is more aggressive on average
for African Americans than white Americans, and that these tumor differences contribute to the racial disparity
in survival. The overarching goal of the project is to define how the CRC survival disparity experienced
by African Americans may be influenced by complex biologic differences in tumor characteristics,
measured by molecular subtypes, driver gene status, and clinicopathologic markers. The research plan
uses molecular epidemiologic and cancer biology approaches to achieve our study aims by leveraging
resources from three established research studies, including CRC tumor tissue data from approximately 420
African American CRC patients and 404 non-Hispanic white CRC patients from the Southern Community
Cohort Study, the Black Women’s Health Study, and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). To fulfill Aim 1, we
will characterize CRC tumors from white and African American CRC patients for clinicopathologic markers
(anatomic site, stage), microsatellite instability, driver gene status (BRAF, and RAS mutation status), and the
recently-defined CRC consensus molecular subtypes. The proposed project will be the first study to define
CRC consensus molecular subtypes in African Americans. Bioinformatics approaches will identify novel gene-
expression molecular subtypes, measured using RNA-seq, to explore the possibility of detecting molecular
subtypes that are more prevalent among African American tumors and that may be linked to CRC prognosis.
(Aim 2). Lastly, to fulfill Aim 3, associations will be determined between the abovementioned tumor
characteristics and CRC survival, and assessed for differences by race. The scientific impact of the proposed
study will be to determine the biological mechanisms contributing to CRC survival disparities experienced by
African Americans by uncovering the molecular attributes of the tumors themselves. The results of the study
will establish the essential foundation for future interventional studies. Currently, CRC treatment is determined
by a combination of molecular factors including stage and the presence of somatic mutations. Emerging CRC
therapies may be guided by additional tumor factors such as tumor gene-expression or the presence of other
targetable features. The existing limited knowledge of the biologic properties of African American CRCs
reduces the prospect that precision medicine will be effective. The proposed study aims to provide data on
African American CRC tumor molecular profiles to support subtype-specific treatments and precision health
strategies to decrease mortality and reduce racial disparities."
10892105,"Ethnic minority groups have a long-term cumulative data disadvantage in biomedical research and clinical
studies. Statistics have shown that over 90% of the samples in cancer-related GWAS and clinical omics projects
were collected from Individuals of European ancestry. This severe data disadvantage of the ethnic minority
groups is set to produce new health disparities as data-driven, algorithm-based biomedical research and clinical
decisions become increasingly common. The new cancer disparity arising from data inequality can potentially
impact all ethnic minority groups in all types of cancers where data inequality exists. Thus, its negative impact is
not limited to the cancer types or subtypes for which significant ethnic disparities have already been evident. The
long-term goal of the proposed research is to prevent or reduce the heath disparities arising from the data
disadvantage of ethnic minority groups. The overall objective of this work is to obtain key knowledge and create
open resources to establish a new paradigm for machine learning with multiethnic clinical omics data. Our central
hypothesis is that the knowledge learned from data of the majority population can be transferred to improve
machine learning performance on the data-disadvantaged ethnic minority groups. Guided by strong preliminary
data, we will pursuit two specific aims to 1) Discover from cancer clinical omics data and genotype-phenotype
data: under what conditions and to what extent the transfer learning scheme improves machine learning model
performance on data-disadvantaged ethnic minority groups; 2) Create an open resource system for unbiased
multiethnic machine learning to prevent or reduce new health disparities arising from the data disadvantage of
ethnic minorities. The approach is innovative because it represents a substantive departure from the status quo
by shifting the paradigm of multiethnic machine learning from mixture learning and independent learning
schemes to a transfer learning scheme. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to establish
a new paradigm for unbiased multiethnic machine learning and to provide an open resource system to facilitate
the paradigm shift, and thus to prevent or reduce health disparities arising from the data disadvantage of ethnic
minorities."
10888300,"ABSTRACT
Each year more than 3 million craniofacial injuries occur in the US as a result of trauma, combat-associated
lesions, tumor removal, congenital abnormalities, and aging. Although some of these conditions can be
addressed by using the patient’s own tissues grafted from another site, this approach leaves the patients
susceptible to infections and creates additional trauma. Currently available methods for treatment and restoration
of craniofacial defects have limitations with the availability of autografts, immune rejection, high cost, inadequate
implant characteristics (oxygen content, mechanical properties, porosity, biocompatibility, degradation, infection
risks), and lack of vascularization. Bone repair is crucial to restore patient functionality post-injury. Scaffolds that
are easy-to-handle, inexpensive, biodegradable, bioactive, and non-immunogenic with adequate porosity and
oxygen content as well as proper mechanical strength are highly sought after for repairing craniofacial defects.
The choice of the implant material is of critical importance to facilitate recovery of the injured patients. Recently
we developed highly porous scaffolds composed of naturally derived polymers and oxygen-generating
components. When combined with cell sources that are compatible with the host, these scaffolds can enhance
craniofacial tissue healing. We propose to use materials that are easily accessible, porous, tunable, degradable,
and biocompatible. We aim to fabricate hybrid hydrogels that are composed of oxygen-generating depots and
gelatin, characterize their physical, chemical, and biological properties as well as studying differentiation of cells
and vascularization in these composites. Our preliminary findings suggest that the proposed novel composite
hydrogels exhibit significantly improved mechanical properties and indicate a favorable in vivo response by
subcutaneous implantation in a rat model as well as full regeneration of critical sized cranial defects. In Aim 1,
we will synthesize and characterize oxygen-generating biomaterials with optimized performance and
characterize them. In Aim 2, we will assess how the oxygen-generating depots affect cell differentiation and
osteogenesis, and develop a vascularized osteogenic model as well as evaluating the functionality of these
constructs. In Aim 3, we will implant these composite biomaterials into critical size calvarial defects in vivo to
induce bone regeneration. We expect that the integration of oxygen-generating depots into photocrosslinkable
hydrogels will result in a material with improved mechanical properties and will promote cell growth,
differentiation, biomineralization, and vascularization. These composite biomaterials will be suitable for repair or
regeneration of craniomaxillofacial tissues. Because oxygen-generating scaffolds will have outstanding
tunability, they are expected to be also useful for applications in other tissues such as cartilage. Porous scaffolds
with high oxygen content are highly promising materials for creating functional vascularized tissues, and are
expected to improve craniomaxillofacial tissue repair and human health."
10907465,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nearly 2 million people are diagnosed with lung cancer each year and it is the leading cause in cancer
related death worldwide. Standard of care for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients has changed little
over the past several years however targeted therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors have recently become
a promising option. The most common oncogenic drivers in NSCLC are mutations in EGFR and KRAS which
upregulate a myriad of downstream signaling pathways that promote tumor cell growth. Until recently, efforts to
develop therapeutics that directly target EGFR or KRAS have largely been met by failure. Specifically,
development of farnesyl transferase inhibitors and downstream pathway inhibitors like MEK and RAF, have not
shown improvement in survival in the clinic and resistance mechanisms are described. The discovery of
KRASG12C mutant inhibitors like AMG 510 and MRTX849 is encouraging as they have both shown promising
signs of clinical activity and promise to transform treatment of KRAS mutant cancer. These inhibitors work by
covalently binding to the reactive Cys12 locking KRAS in its inactive GDP-bound state. However, as with
previously targeted therapies, mechanisms of resistance are beginning to be described.
Utilizing precision modeling in mice, I will test the hypothesis that KRAS allelic imbalance and genetic
determinants in NSCLC drive tumor progression and confer unique responses to targeted therapies. Since our
lab has developed LSL-Kras allelic series that allows for selective targeting of the WT Kras allele, in Aim 1, I will
use CRISPR-based genome editing technology to knockout WT Kras in vivo and measure effects in tumor
burden and G12C inhibitor response. Further, I aim to understand how WT KRAS signaling contributes to the
tumor immune microenvironment and how it affects targeted treatment response. In Aim 2, I will use a patient
data guided approach to elucidate how cooperative mutations in tumor suppressors effect tumor progression
and G12C inhibitor response. This powerful genetic approach will allow me to directly interrogate ways in which
KRASG12C targeted therapy can be affected. Identifying an effective approach to disrupt KRASG12C mutant
NSCLC will have a profound impact on the clinical management of these patients. Thus, we believe our work
will contribute significant pre-clinical data to developing safe and effective targeted therapies for NSCLC and
other cancer types."
10804706,"Project Summary
The proposed translational studies will determine the cereroprotective efficacy of GSK2256294, an FDA-
approved soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitor. Inhibition of sEH increases the endogenous levels of its
substrate epoxyeicosatrienoates (EETs), which are endogenous brain lipid mediators with multiple mechanisms
of action that are beneficial in stroke, including vasodilation, cytoprotection, anti-inflammation and suppression
of platelet aggregation. Ample evidence from our group and others demonstrate that sEH inhibition and gene
deletion reduce infarct size and improve functional outcomes after experimental ischemia-reperfusion injury in
brain. The benefits of sEH inactivation in experimental ischemic stroke have been demonstrated in young and
old male and female mice with diabetes and hypertension. Importantly, gain of function mutations in the sEH
gene, called EPHX2, are associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke and worse outcome in humans,
whereas carriers of a loss-of-function mutation have reduced risk of stroke and improved outcome. We have
recently completed a Phase Ib clinical trial using GSK2256294 in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid
hemorrhage (SAH). The trial demonstrated that GSK2256294, administered orally for 10 days, is safe and well
tolerated in critically ill patients with SAH. Although not powered for efficacy, the trial also showed trends for
improvement in relevant functional outcomes. The proposed studies will test the efficacy of GSK2256294 in the
NINDS Stroke Preclinical Assessment Network (SPAN) using the transient MCAO occlusion (tMCAO) model in
young adult and aged mice with type 2 diabetes. PI will participate on the SPAN Steering Committee, attend all
SPAN meetings and work collaboratively with all awarded sites, the Coordinating Center (CC) and NINDS
Program staff to achieve the goals of the SPAN program. GSK2256294 will be synthesized by a highly
experienced contract research organization (BOC Sciences) and will be provided in a sufficient amount to be
tested in parallel by the entire SPAN network. PI will work with the CC to validate activity, concentration and
solubility of GSK2256294 and test its efficacy in the tMCAO model in a randomized and blinded fashion. The
long-term goal is to support the use of GSK2256294 in a clinical trial for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and advance
its use in AIS patients. Because GSK2256294 is already approved by the FDA and has an established safety
record in humans including in hemorrhagic stroke patients, it can be advanced rapidly for testing in clinical trials
of AIS if efficacy is confirmed through rigorous testing by the SPAN network."
10899447,"Abstract. Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer
death in men in the United States. Although surgery and radiation therapy in patients with low risk disease appear
appropriate and effective, those with high-risk localized disease almost always become hormone refractory and
then rapidly progress. New treatment strategy is urgently needed for patients with high-risk localized prostate
cancer, particularly an approach that considers the use of a multimodal approach and that includes both local
and systemic therapies.
 Cytotoxic drugs are broadly used to treat hematological malignancies and solid tumors and, under certain
clinical conditions, have changed the natural course of some of these diseases. While effective, due to their
intrinsic mode of action, they may also cause significant off-target adverse events that could preclude their full
clinical efficacy, possibly resulting in early discontinuation of medication and a consequent increased risk of
tumor relapse or recurrence. Alternative approaches to both maintain the effectiveness of chemotherapeutic
drugs and minimize systemic toxicity include conjugation of cytotoxic agents to humanized antibodies (also
known as Antibody Drug Conjugates, ADCs). The durable clinical responses reported with brentuximab vedotin
(SGN-35: Seattle Genetics/Takeda) and trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1; Roche in partnership with
ImmunoGen), which have recently obtained regulatory approval, have profoundly changed the outlook for ADC
cancer therapy. These approaches, although showing strong potential, are extremely expensive, and less
complex and more cost-efficient methodologies are needed.
 Here we describe the use of a novel ligand for prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA, a biomarker
for prostate cancer) to target a potent microtubule inhibiting agent, MMAE, and a photodynamic therapy (PDT)
agent, IR700, selectively to prostate cancers. The design of this new drug molecule utilizes a prodrug approach
and simultaneously delivers two drugs selectively to prostate cancer. By selective delivery of two drugs with
different therapeutic mechanisms to cancer cells, improved antitumor activity with less toxicity is expected. The
reduction in toxicity is expected due to anticipated drug synergy (requiring lower drug doses), site specific
prodrug activation, and rapid clearance of the drug molecule, preventing off target delivery. This molecule will
be developed using two animal models of prostate cancer, heterotopic human prostate cancer in mice and
spontaneous prostate cancer in companion dogs. Both MMAE and IR700 therapy have been noted to stimulate
immune response against cancer and we will preliminarily tested this in the immunocompetent companion dogs.
 Dog pathology and physiology of prostate cancer is very similar to humans and dogs are often used in
drug development trials. Since efficacy trials in mice are not predictive of human results, efficacy studies in dogs
will substantially encourage clinical translation of the developed agent."
10909104,"SUMMARY
Experience leads to behavioral change through associative activity of neural circuits. Using this principle,
paired stimulation has been used to selectively strengthen circuits. We propose to target the spinal cord for
associative plasticity, exploiting strong interaction of descending motor connections and large diameter
afferents, which mediate the senses of joint position and muscle tension. In rats and humans, sub-threshold
cervical stimulation, which activates afferents, strongly augments motor cortex evoked muscle responses when
timed to converge in the spinal cord. When pairing is performed repeatedly in rats, spinal cord associative
plasticity (SCAP) is induced with a large and sustained increase in excitability. In rats with cervical spinal cord
injury (SCI), 10 days of SCAP significantly improved forelimb function. We hypothesize that SCAP will
strengthen spinal excitability, modulate reflexes, and increase pinch force in people with cervical SCI. Aim 1
tests the timing of pairing and the circuits mediating paired stimulation, key issues for proper targeting. Timing
cortical and spinal stimulation to converge in the spinal cord, as opposed to cortex, is predicted to be strongest.
We will use both non-invasive and invasive spinal cord stimulation. For non-invasive stimulation, we will
combine transcutaneous stimulation over the neck with transcranial magnetic stimulation over cortex. For
invasive stimulation, we will combine spinal epidural stimulation with transcranial electrical stimulation during
clinically indicated surgery. Aim 2 tests the effects of SCAP to produce a lasting increase in spinal excitability,
as measured by both cortical and spinal evoked potentials and pinch dynamometry. Controls will isolate the
changes induced specifically through pairing. Finally, Aim 3 tests whether paired motor cortex and cervical
spinal cord stimulation produces similar effects in people with the two most common causes of SCI, cervical
myelopathy and traumatic SCI, as uninjured participants. Spinal excitability is predicted to increase, pinch force
is expected to become stronger, and spinal reflexes are expected to diminish. The integrity of spinal pathways
will be measured with both physiology and analysis of cervical MRI. Together, these studies will fill critical gaps
about the nature of associative plasticity in the sensorimotor system and test a new strategy to strengthen
residual connections after SCI. This strategy will be tested with both invasive and non-invasive stimulation,
allowing direct comparison of these approaches for the first time. Thus, we intend to close gaps in our
understanding of how paired stimulation of sensorimotor circuits should be targeted to the spinal cord and
which residual circuits support the plasticity. This knowledge can optimize how we target electrical stimulation
to induce SCAP. Multiple methods of motor cortex and cervical spinal cord stimulation have been proven to be
safe, so these mechanistic studies can be translated quickly to efficacy trials."
10883676,"Project Description
Problematic alcohol consumption is a major health and socio-economic issue within the United States, but
much of the economic burden and pathological consequences from alcohol misuse is associated with binge
drinking. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) has defined binge drinking as a
pattern of drinking that results in a blood ethanol concentration (BEC) of greater than 80mg/dL. Repetitive
binge drinking episodes greatly increases the likelihood of developing ethanol dependence. As such, it is
critical to consider the neurobiological mechanisms that modulate binge drinking in order to develop novel
therapeutic areas to curb alcohol misuse. The neuroimmune system has become of increasing interest as
alcohol abuse can elicit neuroinflammatory cascades that can contribute to alcohol-induced
neurodegeneration, but of more relevance to this study, alcohol can alter the neuroimmune systems role in
neurotransmission and therein contribute to alcohol-related behaviors. This grant furthers our previous studies
of binge-like alcohol’s effects on cytokines in the amygdala by specifically determining the impacts of alcohol
misuse on astrocyte activation and expression patterns (Aim 1). Moreover, the impact of repeated binge-like
drinking episodes on the permanence or plasticity of an altered astrocyte population will be ascertained (Aim
1). Secondly, these studies will determine the role of astrocytic signaling on ethanol consumption and alcohol-
induced anxiolytic behavior (Aim 2), but Aim 3 will also determine whether alcohol’s impact on astrocytic
glutamate and cytokine regulation is related to changes in alcohol consumption and pharmacologic properties.
This will be accomplished by manipulating G-protein coupled receptors specifically in astrocytes using
DREADDs under a GFAP promoter. Because sex-differences can alter neuroimmune responses, these studies
will elucidate the impact of sex on both astrocytes effects on behavior and binge drinking on astrocytes.
Together these three aims will test the overall hypothesis that there is a reciprocal and reinforcing relationship
between alcohol and astrocyte activation associated with the impact of astrocytes on glutamatergic tone and
cytokine production. These innovative studies will provide insight into the role of astrocytes in the transition to
alcohol dependence, novel information regarding the impact of sex on alcohol-induced neuroimmune changes,
and a shift in our understanding of the relationship between alcohol misuse and neuroimmune dysregulation."
10835057,"Project Summary:
Chronic pain is a major healthcare problem with an annual cost of above $600 billion. The quality of data available
for treatments of chronic pain is not optimal. Generalizability of explanatory randomized controlled trial data is
problematic as these trials exclude up to 90% of patients: leaving out real-world patients with serious medical
and psychological comorbidities. Pragmatic trials embedded in patient care compare effectiveness of currently
used treatments in real-world application leading to findings that generalize to broader range of patients.
The changes in clinical practice and workflow necessary to integrate this type of research within patient care
present pragmatic challenges. In this research, my overall objective is to overcome these challenges using an
open-source learning health care system – CHOIR – developed by my mentor at the Stanford Pain Management
Center. CHOIR is currently used to track patients’ clinical trajectory and treatment response across multiple
academic sites resulting in over 25 publications characterizing chronic pain. Through our pilot studies, we have
already developed a point-of-care randomization for CHOIR that facilitates integration of research and patient
care by allowing the physicians to randomize patients during clinic visits. We have already demonstrated
feasibility of the randomization and data collection platform in two ongoing pilot pragmatic clinical trials.
We are proposing to better integrate pragmatic research within our clinical practice through conducting a
randomized comparative effectiveness trial in 450 patients with chronic pain comparing effectiveness of anti-
convulsants and anti-depressants (two most commonly used classes of medications for treatment of chronic
pain). We will use the data available in CHOIR as well as the real-world data generated from this clinical trial to
build, validate and test a model to predict what clinical characteristics can predict response to either of these
classes of medications.
The proposed study is the first step to use flexible point-of-care randomization to compare effectiveness of
different treatments in different subgroups of patients whenever equipoise exists. Our prediction model will guide
decision making process of clinicians choosing between these medications based on clinical characteristics of
individual patients.
Dr. Salmasi is a physician-scientist with clinical training in Pain Medicine as well as academic training in Clinical
Research and Epidemiology. The detailed career development and research plan presented in this application
will provide the required resources and mentorship for him to become an independent R01-funded expert in two
domains critical to his long-term career goals: (1) advanced clinical trial design and conduct; and (2) advanced
statistics and machine learning."
10868723,"Abstract
Acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) is a common pulmonary
syndrome with high mortality. ALI/ARDS stems from a communication breakdown between lung
epithelial cells and immune cells and is a major factor in severe cases of respiratory infection,
including COVID-19. Treatments for ALI/ARDS are currently limited by inadequate models of
the complex relationships between signaling pathways and lung epithelial cell behavior. A core
network of signaling pathways control epithelial structure and cytokine release and are an
important unexploited point of intervention in ALI/ARDS via existing targeted kinase inhibitors or
metabolic modulators. This core network includes NF-kB, a primary transcription factor for
cytokine release and inflammation, and the kinases ERK, AKT, JNK, p38, mTOR and AMPK,
which modulate cytokine production in response to cellular growth and metabolic status.
Notably, this signaling network also plays a causal role in lung cancer and is involved in other
diseases of the lung epithelium, including fibrosis and COPD. Our lab has developed an
extensive live-cell technology platform for tracking temporal programs of signaling events –
different patterns of timing, intensity, and coordination between these pathways – that govern
epithelial cell fate decisions. Our overall objective is to quantitatively decode how cytokine
secretion is specified by multi-kinase activity programs. Our hypothesis is that accounting for
coinciding phases of signaling activity at the single cell level will significantly improve the
prediction of both overall and local variability in cytokine secretion and will identify metabolic
manipulations that reduce inflammation. Our approach will develop the technology needed to
detect and manipulate temporal signaling programs to restore lung epithelial homeostasis in
ALI/ARDS. Aim 1 will develop a high-content data-driven model correlating signaling programs
to cytokine release on a cell-by-cell basis across multiple conditions. Aim 2 will develop the
capacity to characterize the localized inflammatory environment in subregions of lung epithelium
by examining the dynamic programs of kinase signaling in groups of 10-100 neighboring cells.
In the process, we will provide proof of principle for using panels of fixed immunofluorescence
markers to capture dynamic signaling patterns. Aim 3 will investigate the potential for
manipulating temporal signaling programs with existing pharmacological agents, focusing on the
emerging benefits of AMPK activators as a route to modulate the larger signaling network. Our
multi-disciplinary team will work across the boundaries of pulmonary care, cell biology, and
computational systems modeling to create a technology platform that connects modern single-
cell signal transduction analysis to pressing challenges in lung disease. We anticipate that our
project will identify potential new routes of intervention for ALI/ARDS, as well as revealing
general concepts in cytokine signaling pathways that are broadly relevant for the treatment of
lung malignancies and inflammatory disease."

SFSU and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) have developed a cooperative
graduate program to increase the number of under-represented (UR) students that pursue
biomedical research careers. This Program will provide UR students (primarily Biology and
Biochemistry) with a quality and focused master's degree education at SFSU that prepares them
to be competitive for acceptance into top-ranked biomedical science doctoral programs such as
UCSF. The objectives are to: 1) engage all Bridge trainees in research activities, 2) provide the
scientific literacy to ensure the successful completion of M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in a timely
manner, and 3) ensure the transition of Bridge trainees to Ph.D. programs. These objectives will
be successfully met through the combination of (i) close and careful academic and research
advising by peers, preceptors, course instructors and PDs, (ii) a nurturing and productive research
experience with Bridge preceptors, (iii) registration in two courses (“Strategies for Success” and
“Science Coding Immersion Program (SCIP)”) that provide professional development to improve
quantitative, writing, and oral communication skills while building community, and (iv) role
modeling from established UR scientists in our formal Speaker Series. The M.S. program is
divided into 4 semesters, with a unique “Strategies for Success” each semester, and the “SCIP”
course in the summer between 1st and 2nd year. The “Strategies” course develops writing and oral
communication skills through development of the IDP, statement of purpose, abstract writing,
presentations and mock interviews. Ph.D. preparation includes informational sessions on Ph.D.
programs, and PhD/career panels led by SFSU alumni. These courses also cover RCR and rigor
and reproducibility, over 2 semesters. SCIP develops community through coding lessons, with
biologically-relevant data sets. Over the last 15 years, 175 previously funded M.S. students have
completed Ph.D. programs, with another 75 pending (anticipated completion dates between 2021-
2025). Over the last 5 years alone, an average of 22.4 students have entered Ph.D. programs
yearly, with an average of 3.6 entering UCSF Ph.D. programs (2, 2, 4, 3 and 7 entering from 2016-

year), to maintain the strong success of the combined NIH Bridge and RISE programs previously
in existence at SFSU."
10893966,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia (affecting ~1-2% of the
general population), resulting in markedly reduced quality of life and increased mortality, due to a combination
of altered hemodynamics, progressive atrial and ventricular dysfunction, and embolic stroke. Many diseases and
conditions, like heart failure, are known to contribute to pathological changes leading to AF. Limitations in current
therapy allow AF paroxysms to progress to persistent and chronic AF, as a result of extensive atrial structural
and electrical changes that facilitate AF maintenance (“AF begets AF”). The development of urgently needed
new strategies for AF treatment hinges upon improved understanding of how abnormalities in cellular function
trigger and sustain arrhythmia in atrial tissue. At the cellular level, a hallmark structural change of many chronic
cardiac diseases is degradation of the intricate membrane architecture that couples cardiac electrical excitation
to intracellular Ca2+ release and myocardial contraction (EC coupling) – i.e., the transverse tubule (TT) structures,
which project orthogonally from the cell surface to its interior and thereby synchronize EC coupling throughout
the cell. Degradation of the TT architecture is generally associated with arrhythmia, but it is not yet clear whether
TT loss is a direct contributor to arrhythmia, a compensatory maladaptation, or an epiphenomenon. This is even
less clear in atria, as atrial myocytes exhibit a vastly variable range of TT architectures, with prominent axial
tubules. Further, TT degradation induced by the process of isolating atrial myocytes (vs. denser TTs in intact
tissues) and challenges in experimentally detubulating intact cardiac tissue has so far limited the design of
mechanistic myocyte and tissue studies. As a result, the literature surrounding the role of subcellular structural
(ultrastructural) remodeling in AF has remained fractured, and currently we know relatively little about its role in
contributing to AF pathophysiology. The overarching goal of this proposal is to discriminate the role of changes
in atrial myocyte ultrastructure from other disease-associated sequelae by combining detailed multi-level
experimental analyses of rabbit atrial myocytes and rabbit and human atrial tissues with extensive quantitative
multi-scale computational modeling. The project will develop and validate a suite of modeling tools used to
investigate the mechanisms by which: (1) naturally occurring variations in atrial TTs influence EC coupling and
membrane stability in isolated atrial myocytes; (2) tissue gradients in TT organization influence tissue-level
electrophysiological and EC coupling outcomes; (3) ultrastructural remodeling synergizes with ionic remodeling
to favor atrial arrhythmogenesis in atrial cardiomyopathy. We contend that quantifying the role of atrial
ultrastructure in AF pathology may shed new mechanistic insight into AF management. Each aim includes
rigorously generated and validated modeling frameworks, informed by novel experiments in atrial myocytes and
tissues, and testing of specific hypotheses. Models and data will be distributed freely and widely via software
and database infrastructure supported by Dr. Grandi's lab and scientific networking sites."

Genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's Disease can predict the increased likelihood of acquiring the disease yet it
is becoming more evident that external factors are involved in the neurodegenerative disease progression.
Recently two herpesviruses have been implicated in this disorder as they have been found in diseased tissues
of Alzheimer's patients. Human herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and Human Herpesvirus 6a (HHV6a) are
neurotropic herpesviruses that establish both lytic and lifelong latent infections of the nervous system. How
these viral pathogens alter the outcome of neurodegenerative disease remains uncharacterized. Alzheimer's
Disease is marked by distinct alterations of host proteins including the misfolding of Tau. Using a novel human
iPSC-derived 3D cortical model system, we observed altered splicing of the mRNA that encodes Tau.
Additionally, we observe a viral infection dependent increase in the accumulation of phospho-Tau, a post
translational modification indicating the misfolding of Tau. These preliminary findings support the hypothesis
that viral infections directly impact the host cell microenvironment resulting in changes in Alzheimer's Disease
markers. The overarching goal of these studies is to identify infectious etiological agents that impact either the
severity or frequency of Alzheimer's Disease progression. The objective of this proposal is to define the
biological impact of neurotropic herpesvirus infections on accumulation of known drivers of Alzheimer's
disease within a physiologically relevant model system. Our first aim will identify and define viral dependent
changes within multiple host proteins involved in neurodegeneration. This will for the first time, a direct link
between neurotropic virus infections and pathogenic neurodegenerations in cells of clinical relevance. The
second aim will use novel RNA labeling protocols to profile the transcriptome from only infected cells within the
3D organoids and will utilize single cell sequencing to characterize the tropism of these neurotropic viruses.
The third aim will utilize 3D organoids that harbor known genetic risk factor mutations found in the onset of
Alzheimer's Disease and will determine if herpesviruses amplify the onset of neurodegenerative progression.
Successful completion will clearly define the viral factors that influence Alzheimer's disease and will provide
insight in pathogenic mechanisms that extend beyond Alzheimer's Disease."

Liver cancer in the U.S. has tripled since the 1980s and is now among the leading causes of cancer deaths.
Although hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are common causes of liver cancer,
~70% of liver cancer is non-viral in the U.S., though we know little about its risk factors. The essential role of
Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), and other Helicobacter species in liver carcinogenesis (i.e., H. bilis, H.
hepaticus) has recently been described in animal studies. These species also colonize in human liver tissue,
but very limited research has assessed H. pylori or other Helicobacter species and liver cancer. We propose a
pooled prospective study using the cohorts participating in the Liver Cancer Pooling Project in the U.S. that will
be the most comprehensive study to date of H. pylori, other Helicobacter species, and liver cancer. Our long-
term goal is to identify novel risk factors for liver cancer of both viral and non-viral etiology. Furthermore,
although liver cancer disproportionally affects racial/ethnic minorities, the underlying causes remain unclear.
Our pilot work showed that African Americans (AAs) have higher prevalence than whites in overall H. pylori
infection (89% vs. 60%), CagA-positive (75% vs. 36%), and VacA-positive infection (94% vs. 88%), suggesting
a novel approach to determine the extent to which high prevalence of Helicobacter infection could explain liver
cancer disparity. The objective of this grant is to (1) identify H. pylori and other Helicobacter infection as novel
risk factors for liver cancer, especially those with non-viral etiology; and (2) investigate the differences in
prevalence of Helicobacter infection by racial/ethnic groups that could explain liver cancer disparity. Our
rationale is that identification of the key bacteria as risk factors for liver cancer will offer new opportunities for
prevention and intervention of liver cancer and reducing related disparities. Our specific aims will estimate the
associations between H. pylori infection and risk of developing liver cancer overall and by viral status (Aim 1);
quantify the associations between other Helicobacter infection and risk of developing liver cancer overall and
by viral status (Aim 2); and characterize the associations between Helicobacter infection and risk of liver
cancer separately for AAs and whites (Aim 3). This will enable us to identify the role of H. pylori and other
Helicobacter species in liver carcinogenesis by viral status and race/ethnicity. This research is innovative
because we are the first pooled study to use a unique resource of >408,700 racially and ethnically diverse men
and women who have been followed for up to 32 years, distinguish between viral and non-viral liver cancer,
and quantify the association between H. bills and H. hepaticus infection and liver cancer risk in AAs and
whites. The contribution is significant because these discoveries will facilitate design of innovative intervention
strategies to reduce liver cancer incidence, mortality, and related disparities in populations."

Anterior uveitis is the most common form of intraocular inflammation in children. Children tend to have more
chronic courses than adults and thus require more frequent examinations for screening and monitoring of
inflammation. Clinical grading of anterior chamber (AC) inflammation, both cell and flare, is currently performed
at the slit lamp utilizing the widely accepted Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group
criteria. However, this system has limitations since it is non-continuous and semi-quantitative. A rapid,
reproducible, and quantitative technique to evaluate inflammation is of paramount importance in children as
they are often unable to cooperate with prolonged examination at the slit lamp.
This K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award proposal seeks to evaluate objective
measures of intraocular inflammation to improve the diagnosis and monitoring of anterior uveitis in children.
This award will provide Dr. Edmund Tsui, a uveitis specialist and Assistant Professor at the Stein Eye Institute
at the University of California, Los Angeles, with the protected research time and formal coursework towards a
Master’s of Science in Clinical Research to establish himself as an investigator in patient-oriented research in
uveitis. This award will provide Dr. Tsui with the support to achieve the following goals: 1) to learn biostatistics
and epidemiology, 2) to become skilled at image acquisition, processing and analysis, 3) to learn about the
design and implementation of clinical trials. Dr. Tsui has assembled an outstanding multi-disciplinary team of
mentors to ensure that he will achieve these goals. His mentorship team consists of Dr. Gary N. Holland
(Professor of Ophthalmology and an expert in pediatric uveitis), Dr. Srinivas R. Sadda (Professor of
Ophthalmology and a world-leader in ophthalmic image processing and analysis), and Dr. Deborah K.
McCurdy (Professor of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Rheumatology and an expert in pediatric arthritis).
We will pursue the following specific aims: 1) develop a standardized, reproducible technique using anterior-
segment optical coherence tomography to quantify AC cells, 2) longitudinally evaluate AC flare using laser
flare photometry, and 3) create a predictive risk stratification model based on objective measures of intraocular
inflammation. The long-term goal is that these results would support the use of objective measures in routine
clinical practice and as endpoints in clinical trials. Ultimately, earlier detection and improved monitoring of
uveitis in children can prevent permanent vision loss and disability. This research will lead to the submission of
an R01 grant prior to the end of the K23 award to enable Dr. Tsui to become an independent clinician-scientist."
10894803,"Abstract
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a destructive inflammatory joint disease associated with increased
morbidity and mortality. While biologic therapies have improved treatment response, unmet clinical
needs remain due to the refractory nature of RA, and recurrent disease flares despite aggressive
treatment. In the prior funding periods, we developed a multidisciplinary translational research program
that combined longitudinal near infrared (NIR) imaging of indocyanine green (ICG) with targeted
therapies to elucidate how TNF, B cells and lymphatics converge to trigger arthritic flare in murine
models and RA patients. Specifically, we found that prior to RA signs and symptoms, there is an
increase in lymphatic vessel (LV) contraction frequency to enhance the efflux of CD11b+ myeloid cells
from the affected joints, which ultimately gets overwhelmed at early onset. RA disease proceeds with
expansion of joint draining lymph nodes from an influx of unactivated-polyclonal CD23+/CD21hi/CD1d hi
B cells in inflamed nodes (Bin) and lymph, until a sudden loss of LV contractions is observed along the
ipsilateral axis, which results in lymph node collapse and Bin clogging of the sinuses. Interestingly,
knee synovitis following popliteal lymph node (PLN) collapse in TNF-Tg mice is ameliorated by anti-
CD20 B cell depletion therapy (BCDT), which restores passive but not active lymph flow. Most recently,
we demonstrated that loss of LV contractions in TNF-Tg mice is secondary to activated macrophage
adherence to the lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC), and subsequent LEC and lymphatic muscle cell
(LMC) damage from chronic inflammation. Remarkably, this major defect can be corrected with anti-
TNF therapy that ameliorates the inflammatory-erosive arthritis, and restores LEC-LMC integrity. To
further understand the role of lymphatics in arthritic flare, we propose three Specific Aims. In Aim 1 we
will demonstrate perivascular LMC progenitor incorporation into PLVs during growth and flare in WT
growing mice (homeostasis), and TNF-Tg mice with Expanding vs. Collapsed PLN treated with anti-
TNF or placebo. We will also confirm their LMC progenitor potential in adoptive transfer studies in vitro
and in vivo. In Aim 2 we will demonstrate the role of PDGF signaling in LMC during the Expanding
and Collapsed phases of arthritic progression via functional genomic studies, and genetic loss of
function in the setting of acute collagen antibody-induced arthritis and chronic TNF-induced arthritis in
mice. To correlate these animal studies with human disease, in Aim 3 we will complete a clinical pilot
of RA patients receiving anti-TNF therapy for hand flare, to formally demonstrate the utility of NIR-ICG
imaging as a biomarker of LV recovery, and its correlation with response to therapy. Completion of
these Specific Aims will substantiate our paradigm-shifting hypothesis of RA flare, and may provide
novel insights into refractory disease that can be diagnosed by assessing efferent lymphatics."
11103019,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive type of brain cancer that arises de novo and is therapy resistant. A key
contributor to poor outcomes in GBM is a subpopulation of cells called glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) that evade
conventional cytotoxic therapies and repopulate as recurrent tumors. A fuller understanding of the molecular
mechanisms underlying the biology and therapy resistance of GSCs is required. Our group has shown that TAZ,
a transcriptional co-factor is highly expressed in about 70% of GBMs. TAZ and its paralog YAP are oncogenic
drivers of brain tumor progression. GSCs overexpressing TAZ undergo a proneural to mesenchymal subtype
transition. TAZ driven cell fate change is accompanied by aggressive behavior such as increased grade, necrosis
and radio-resistance. Silencing YAP/TAZ ablates tumor growth by activating neurogenic programs, thus making
these proteins attractive therapeutic targets. Although the oncogenic functions of YAP/TAZ are well established
in GBM, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying cell fate transition and their contribution to therapy
resistance are not fully understood. We have now accumulated substantial evidence to pinpoint a direct role for
YAP/TAZ in DNA damage response pathway, a network of proteins that sense and repair DNA lesions in
response to ionizing radiation (IR) treatments. YAP/TAZ also cause by enhancer reprogramming and recruitment
of distinct molecular complexes in proneural and mesenchymal gene enhancers, which offers protection of DNA
damage vulnerable regions of the genome. In this proposal, we will deeply investigate the molecular mechanisms
underlying YAP/TAZ driven control of neurogenic programs and radio-resistance using both conventional and
state-of-the-art molecular, cellular and biochemical approaches. Importantly, we will evaluate the therapeutic
benefit of novel pharmacological inhibitors of the YAP/TAZ in combination with IR using pre-clinical models of
GBM. Successful completion of these studies will not only unravel the mechanistic underpinnings behind
neuronal differentiation and DNA damage repair in GBM, but also inform the development of next generation of
clinical trials for GBM."
10865012,"PROJECT DESCRIPTION
 The hallmarks of the aging blood system, such as chronic inflammatory disorders, anemia,
immunosenescence and hematological malignancies, result in large part from hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)
dysfunction. Age-associated loss of HSC function is linked to metabolic deregulation, increased dependence on
autophagy, loss of epigenetic fidelity, replication stress-associated genomic instability, and chronic exposure to
local inflammation in the aged bone marrow (BM) niche microenvironment. However, these remain largely
descriptive features of HSC aging. This project aims to develop a coherent and mechanistic model of how these
extrinsic signals and intrinsic molecular mediators promote old HSC dysfunction, ultimately suggesting
actionable targets for rejuvenation interventions. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that autophagy
engagement is a prosurvival stress-response mechanism that protects a subset of old HSCs from chronic
inflammation in the aged BM niche. Specifically, we will probe whether increased oxidative metabolism in old
HSCs functions to compensate for decreased glucose utilization due to chronic inflammation-induced insulin
resistance. Insulin resistance is increasingly appreciated to affect non-canonical tissues, such as the brain,
where it has been connected to age-associated inflammation and neurodegeneration. We will establish how the
inflamed marrow milieu directly promotes insulin/IGF-1 pathway resistance, how this drives autophagy
engagement and metabolic adaptation in a subset of old HSCs, and whether old HSC regenerative potential can
be improved through fasting/refeeding interventions via normalization of insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake.
In Aim 2, we will further dissect how replication stress contributes to the functional exhaustion of aged HSCs. In
particular, we will focus on the fragile ribosomal DNA (rDNA) loci, which are severely impacted by replication
stress in old HSCs, interfering with ribosome biogenesis. Defects in ribosome biogenesis lead to an accumulation
of free ribosomal proteins triggering activation of a p53-dependent nucleolar stress response, as well as defects
in protein translation, whose stringent regulation is critical for maintaining HSC functionality. We will explore the
interplay between replication and nucleolar stress, investigate the intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms surrounding
decreased ribosomal biogenesis and impaired proteostasis, and identify the cellular programs responsible for
the onset of replication stress in old HSCs to design functional rejuvenation interventions. This work has exciting
implications for elucidating the biology of HSC aging at molecular resolution and identifying actionable targets
for promoting HSC functional longevity, a logical strategy for restoring blood and immune cell production in the
elderly."

Project Summary/Abstract
Black women face disproportionately high rates of maternal morbidity and mortality in the United States, both
of which are on the rise, in direct contrast to the improved rates globally. Prenatal care has been
identified as a way to potentially mitigate these risks, but racism and racial discrimination are barriers to
women in accessing prenatal care. The 2019-2023 Trans-NIH Strategic Plan for Women’s Health calls for
research that addresses these stark health disparities for women of color. My long-term career goal is lead
research to inform interventions that will optimize the reproductive health and wellbeing of Black women. I aim
to become a leading investigator applying a reproductive justice framework to understand clinical and structural
factors underpinning health adversities experienced by Black women. In this K01 Mentored Research Scientist
Development Award, I propose to 1) Refine a racial equity training intervention for prenatal care settings; 2)
Pilot test the effects of the racial equity training intervention on clinician outcomes; and 3) Explore the impact of
the racial equity training intervention in reducing disparities in adequate care in a sub-sample of Black and
white women. I will seek advanced training to support these research goals in 1) intervention development and
implementation science, 2) clinical research in cluster randomized designs, and 3) professional skills in project
management, leadership, and grantsmanship. These endeavors will benefit from interdisciplinary mentorship
from world-renowned scholars including primary mentor Monica McLemore, PhD, MPH, RN, FAAN (clinical
obstetric care, racial equity, reproductive justice), and co-mentors Miriam Kuppermann, PhD, MPH (perinatal
care models, shared decision-making, professional leadership at UCSF), Charles McCulloch, PhD
(biostatistics), and Cynthia Harper, PhD (human centered design and health education). In addition, faculty
advisor Andrea Jackson, MD, MAS will provide expertise in prenatal and delivery healthcare settings. The
Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of California at San Francisco will provide the
infrastructure to support these activities. The department made a competitive offer to recruit me into a faculty
position in 2018, and departmental leadership is highly committed to my success, providing both resources and
protected time. The training and research activities proposed in this K01 build on my strong background in
health behavior and racial inequities in reproductive health and give me essential new skills to facilitate my
transition to an independent investigator. I aim to lead research using a multi-method approach to understand
the mechanisms by which the social ecology produces sexual and reproductive health disparities and to inform
interventions to advance Black women’s health."

The Experimental Models Core is responsible for curation, tracking, quality control, and distribution of all 
glioblastoma (GBM) animal models (patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, PDX-derived organoids, syngeneic 
mouse and genetically engineered mice) for experimental studies in all Projects and biospecimens from humans 
for validation across multiple institutions. The Core will also be responsible for the generation of organoids from 
these models, for two-photon in vivo imaging of tumors in mice, and for single cell and spatial transcriptomics as 
technology resources for the P01. A suite of >180 PDX GBM models and >5 syngeneic mouse models with 
genomic profiling (DNA, RNA sequencing) are available for hypothesis testing by the projects. Human specimens 
to confirm findings from mouse models will help validate sex differences, albeit the innate heterogeneity across 
human patients compared to mouse models is a caveat. The core strengthens the projects and the P01 by 
coordinating the distribution of models for experimental studies in which the sex of the tumor cells are 
characterized via sex gene-specific PCR and sex chromosome karyotyping. The goals of the Experimental 
Models Core will be accomplished through the following specific aims: 1) To create, organize, and maintain 
infrastructure, then deploy syngeneic and genetically engineered mouse glioma models, patient-derived 
xenograft GBM models, short-term GBM cultures and organoids, providing high-quality, scientifically relevant 
biospecimens to P01 investigators using standardized collection, quality control, storage/tracking and distribution 
under approved IACUC guidelines, and 2) To make high-quality, scientifically-relevant clinical biospecimens 
available to the P01 investigators through continued efforts and innovations in standardized collection, quality 
control (including centralized neuro pathology review), storage/tracking and distribution under proper human 
subject (OHRP) regulatory guidelines using secure, readily accessible databases. A decided benefit of the 
Experimental Models Core is the coordination and visibility of shared use of models across all Projects, with 
shared quality control, batch (or passage) effects, growth characteristics, genomic profiling, and cross-Project 
data sharing from the experimental outcomes."

Infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis continues to be a leading cause of death worldwide. Efforts to
combat the tuberculosis pandemic are hampered by the lack of an effective vaccine. Vaccines against Mtb and
other intracellular pathogens that require cell-based immunity for control have been difficult to develop, in part
due to the limited number of adjuvants that elicit effective cell-based immunity. We recently reported that that
STING-activating cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) formulated in a protein subunit vaccine elicit long-lasting
protective immunity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the mouse model. The efficacy of CDN adjuvanted
vaccines is dramatically improved when the vaccine is delivered via a mucosal route. Here we propose to
perform an in-depth characterization of the immune response to CDN adjuvanted protein subunit vaccines for
tuberculosis. First, we will determine how STING activation results in the development of protective immunity,
using knockout mice to dissect the contribution of the different outputs of STING signaling. Second, we have
found that the efficacy of vaccination with CDN is dependent on IL-17, however the mechanisms underlying the
protective efficacy of IL-17 are unknown. We will determine how IL-17 impacts the vaccine elicited immune
response, which CD4 Th17 subsets are most important, and which cell types in the lung respond to IL-17.
Finally, we test CDN adjuvanted protein subunit vaccines in heterologous prime boost regimens designed to
elicit complementary immune responses using recombinant BCG and Listeria monocytogenes strains
developed by the Cox (Project 2) and Portnoy (Project 1) labs. If successful, this project will uncover novel
mechanisms by which vaccines can elicit protective immunity to TB, and will exploit this knowledge to identify
vaccination regimens with enhanced efficacy."

 The goal of the proposed 5-year training program is to facilitate Dr. Mai Dang’s full transition to an
independent physician scientist. Her work is focused on identifying novel ways to modulate the brain tumor
immune microenvironment to improve treatment strategies for pediatric patients. Dr. Dang’s research
background is in neuroscience and her clinical training in pediatric neurology, which was completed at the
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. After clinical fellowship, she received additional clinical training in neuro-
oncology while completing her fellowship research on identifying the heterogeneity of myeloid cells in
medulloblastoma. She was recently recruited to Washington University in St. Louis as a tenured-track assistant
professor in the Department of Neurology to continue this work with strong institutional support. She will use
the next five years of mentored training to acquire additional essential knowledge on immunology and
advanced research tools to perform investigations in cancer immunology. While her prior work was specifically
on macrophages and microglia, her current proposal will focus on antigen presenting cells and their interaction
with the adaptive arm of the immune system. Dr. Dang will be mentored by Dr. Milan Chheda, a physician
scientist, whose expertise is on developing new therapies that target glioblastoma brain tumor cancer stem
cells and the tumor microenvironment. She will be co-mentored by Dr. David DeNardo, who has expertise in
immunology and the tumor microenvironment’s regulation of therapy response in pancreatic and lung cancer.
They will be joined by a committee comprised of two highly seasoned mentors, both physician scientists with
excellent track record for and commitment to training other physician scientists at WUSTL. Dr. Christine
Gurnett is Head of Pediatric neurology, who is highly recognized for her work in the genetics of neurological
disorders, and Dr. Joshua Rubin, Professor in Oncology is an expert on pediatric and adult brain tumors. This
team is deeply committed to providing Dr. Dang with scientific, technical, and career mentorship to assist her in
this launch of her independent research career.
 The research goal of this proposal is to identify reversible causes of immune suppression in
medulloblastomas treated with radiation. The central hypothesis is that effective tumor immunity after radiation
in a pediatric brain tumor will require both reducing suppressive myeloid cells and increasing functional antigen
presenting cells. She will use advanced tools such as inducible depletion of immune cells and single-cell
analysis paired with assays to directly measure the function of antigen presenting cells and cytotoxic T cells to
study this hypothesis. Findings from this work will uncover ways to effectively use immunotherapy to augment
radiation efficacy to improve overall survival and morbidity for pediatric brain tumor patients."
10850849,"PROJECT SUMMARY (APOE U19 Core E: Human iPSC Models Core)
Human somatic and stem cell models have emerged as a powerful system for modeling the complexities of
pathological gene expression, particularly in the early phase of disease. Further, human stem cells can be
differentiated into cell-types that secrete apoE and that are affected in disease, such as neurons, astrocytes,
microglia, and vascular mural cells (VMCs), as well as 3D “mini-brain” cerebral organoids. The Core E will
build upon the existing resources and technology from three institutions at the forefront of stem cell modeling of
apoE-related biology and pathobiology in AD: MCJ (Guojun Bu), WUSTL (Celeste Karch), and ISMMS (Julia
TCW) to generate a comprehensive collection of well-characterized human iPSC lines with different APOE
genotypes from deeply phenotyped patients and through isogenic conversions. The established iPSC lines
with different APOE genotypes, sex, ethnicity, and disease status will serve both this U19 and the broader
scientific community to address critical gaps in our knowledge of the effects of apoE isoforms in different
human brain cell types. In so doing, Core E will support U19 Projects and the broader scientific community by
testing a critical component of the ApoE Cascade Hypothesis (ACH): to understand the effects of apoE
isoforms on biochemical and cellular events leading to eventual phenotypic outcomes. Thus, Core E will work
synergistically with Core A, B, F, G and Projects 1-5 to address the ACH hypothesis and to become an
invaluable resource for the broader scientific community."
10850876,"PROJECT SUMMARY (APOE U19 Project 5)
The most important Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk gene is apolipoprotein E (APOE). APOE4 is associated with
a dose dependent increase in risk, while APOE2 is associated with a dose dependent decrease in risk and
delayed age at onset (AAO), relative to APOE3/3. Population-based studies have demonstrated that APOE4/4
homozygotes have ~60% life-time risk for AD by age 85 yrs compared to ~10% in APOE3/3 homozygotes.
Despite this strong effect on AD susceptibility, there is huge variation (several decades) in AAO even within a
single APOE genotype. We hypothesize that in human populations there are both risk and protective alleles in
genes that modify AAO within a single APOE genotype by acting within the same cascade of events that
modify AD risk and AAO downstream of APOE (see Overall section for detailed description of the ApoE
Cascade Hypothesis). In this project we will analyze publicly available data to identify genes that
modify AD risk in APOE4 carriers and APOE3/3 homozygotes. Preliminary analyses have identified rare
TREM2 variants as modifiers of AAO in APOE3/3 homozygotes and rare EIF2B3 variants as modifiers of AAO
in APOE4 carriers. ApoE is a secreted apolipoprotein that is primarily expressed in astrocytes. However,
APOE expression is highly upregulated in subpopulations of microglia and other macrophages, particularly in
response to tissue damage and lipid overload in the aged or diseased brain, in a manner that is at least in part
dependent on TREM2. This is of particular relevance to AD because genetic studies have demonstrated that
common risk alleles are specifically enriched in myeloid/microglial enhancers, suggesting that the effects of
APOE genotype and its genetic modifiers on AD risk and AAO may be mediated by their effects on microglial
cell function. We hypothesize that APOE genotype and its genetic modifiers alter AD risk/AAO through
modulation of microglial cell function, particularly in response to brain tissue damage in aging and disease. To
address this hypothesis we will use isogenic hiPSC-derived microglia (iMGL) to assess the impact of
APOE genotype and its genetic modifiers (TREM2 R47H & EIF2B3 S404A) on microglial cell function in
vitro and transplantation of isogenic hiPSC-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells (iHPCs) into mice to
assess the impact of APOE genotype and its genetic modifiers (TREM2 R47H & EIF2B3 S404A) on
microglial cell function in AD mouse brains. This project will be performed in collaboration with Cores C, E
and G and addresses aims 2, 4 and 6 of the overall U19 project. Project 5 will identify novel modifiers of AAO
of AD in the context of different APOE risk backgrounds and determine the molecular consequences of these
novel risk genes on microglial function in vitro and in vivo. In so doing, Project 5, together with Projects 2-4,
will provide insight into ApoE function in microglia leading to the identification of novel therapeutic targets for
AD and generation of unique resources/data to be shared with the scientific community through Core A."
10868634,"The Penn Center for Musculoskeletal Disorders (PCMD) at the University of Pennsylvania will enhance the
research productivity of, and provide critical services, resources and programs to, established and new
investigators who represent our Center membership. The overall goal of this Center is to promote cooperative
interactions among investigators, accelerate and enrich the effectiveness and efficiency of ongoing research,
foster new collaborations and new research, and ultimately, translate our research efforts into better and new
therapies for musculoskeletal disorders. This will be done through providing critical research infrastructure,
state-of-the-art research resources, study design guidance, and intellectual expertise to musculoskeletal
investigators. Importantly, the Center serves as a local and regional resource to expand the musculoskeletal
community and recruit new investigators to the field. We have chosen to continue the theme of
“Musculoskeletal Tissue Injury and Repair” for the Center. The Administrative Core coordinates all of the
necessary leadership, organizational and supervisory activities of the Center. Importantly, the Administrative
Core is on the 3rd floor of Stemmler Hall, the same floor/building as the three Resource Cores, defining a clear
home for the PCMD overall.
 The Specific Aims of this Administrative Core are to: Aim 1: Coordinate, integrate, communicate, and
monitor the Center components and activities; Aim 2: Advise the Center Director regarding the activities of the
Center; Aim 3: Administer the Pilot and Feasibility Grant Program and its associated funding and reporting;
Aim 4: Implement an Enrichment Program; and Aim 5: Provide a Resource Sharing Plan. A well organized
Administrative Core is essential to accomplish our Aims, and maximize research activity, efficiency, and
productivity of the more than 200 Center faculty members. One of the great strengths of our Center is its
inclusive approach with a broad spectrum of activities and interactions. Further, it has evolved into a regional
technical and intellectual hub for the broader Philadelphia musculoskeletal research community and beyond,
attracting and providing resources to faculty from more than 15 other institutions in our region. One more
intangible feature to our Administrative Core and Center that should not be overlooked is our unique voice
representing the musculoskeletal research community at Penn. The University’s biomedical research
community in general is very large and engaged in multiple disciplines and fields. As a result, this P30
supported Center performs an essential role by highlighting the importance, broad relevance, and excitement
of musculoskeletal research across campus, and provides our members a strong voice and presence across
the University. Having a clear, consistent, and strong voice for musculoskeletal researchers has served, and
will continue to serve, our collective and individual research goals. In these ways, the Center - with critical
financial support from the P30 - is indispensable for our local and regional research community."
10868637,"While musculoskeletal tissues have multiple biological roles, their primary function is to provide
mechanical support to enable the activities of daily living. With injury, aging, degeneration, or disease,
musculoskeletal tissues may experience a decline in mechanical function, and this loss of function can
originate at different length scales. With development, growth, and therapeutic treatment, mechanical function
can improve and change across these same length scales. As such, it is essential that assessment of
musculoskeletal tissue mechanics be a primary focus in both basic and translational studies of musculoskeletal
tissue formation, development, degeneration, and treatment. Moreover, the innovation and sophistication of
biomechanical quantification must continue to develop at a pace on par with the ever-deepening mechanistic
knowledge of musculoskeletal tissue molecular biology and physiology, with advances in molecular and
imaging technologies, and with new therapeutic developments in order to discern the functional outcomes in
these studies. The overall objective of the Biomechanics Core (BC) is to to develop and provide a wide
range of standard and innovative biomechanical approaches to evaluate musculoskeletal tissue
function across length scales in the context of development, disease, injury and repair, and to provide
training and funding for new projects and collaborations utilizing these assays.
 Over the last funding cycle, the Biomechanics Core (BC) at the Penn Center for Musculoskeletal
Disorders (PCMD) has developed into a thriving resource for the musculoskeletal research community at the
University of Pennsylvania and in the Philadelphia region and neighboring states. In this renewal application,
we will further expand our services to meet the increased demand for specialized techniques and develop new
and innovative methods that address the multi-scale mechanics of musculoskeletal tissues. The BC will
continue to operate under the direction of Dr. Robert Mauck (BC Director since 2011), along with contributions
and support from Dr. Snehal Shetye (BC Technical Director since 2015). Our Specific Aims are to provide
guidance and training (Aim 1), to provide expertise and service for biomechanical assays (Aim 2), to develop
innovative biomechanical testing techniques (Aim 3), and to provide funding for the development of novel,
explorative projects and collaborations (Aim 4). Successful completion of these Aims will significantly enhance
the environment and the capabilities of researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and the regional research
community, leading to new approaches to address musculoskeletal disorders across length scales and
stimulating new collaborations between current and new PCMD members who have not previously included
analysis of biomechanical function in their musculoskeletal research programs."

Natives Engaged in Alzheimer’s Research (NEAR) will be organized into an Administrative Core, a Recruitment
and Engagement Core, a Biospecimen Core, a Research Methods Core, and 3 Research Projects. We will also
incorporate a nationwide network of 8 Satellite Centers led by American Indian/Alaska Native and Native
Hawaiian/Pacific Islander investigators who will assist with outreach, recruitment, and biospecimen collection.
The contact Principal Investigator and Administrative Core Leader of NEAR, Dedra Buchwald, MD, Professor of
Medicine at Washington State University, is widely recognized for her research, experience, and leadership in
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias in Native communities, and for her ongoing efforts to eliminate health
disparities. She is the Founding Director of Partnerships for Native Health, a program of culturally appropriate
research that has established 150+ partnerships with various Native entities in a 15-state region, including tribes,
Indian health facilities, and organizations serving American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and
Pacific islanders. Dr. Buchwald will be joined by James Galvin, MD, MPH, Professor, University of Miami, who
will serve as the Scientific Director of NEAR and as a Multiple Principal Investigator and by John Kauwe, PhD,
who will also serve as a Multiple Principal Investigator and as Co-Leader of the Biospecimen Core. This Core
will integrate the contributions of 6 academic partner institutions, all of which have experience collaborating with
American Indian/Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, and other underrepresented minority
populations, and with strengths in administration, research methods, scholarship, community-informed research,
field work, and dissemination. Notably, our 3 Research Projects include 11 tribes, 7 urban Indian programs,
an AI-owned small business, and 5 Native Hawaiian-serving community organizations. Our Specific Aims
are to: 1) Support logistical and field operations across academic sites, including coordination of meetings and
travel, and facilitate interactions with the Satellite Centers; 2) Oversee a plan for management, organization, and
communication that stimulates, coordinates, integrates, and monitors activities and functions across and among
all NEAR Research Projects, Cores, faculty, and institutions; 3) Supervise and facilitate implementation of key
strategic decisions, research regulatory processes, and data sharing plans; 4) Collaborate on program planning,

10883606,"RESEARCH METHODS CORE: ABSTRACT
Healthy People 2020 calls for research and policy to eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in health status, health
behaviors, functional limitations, and healthcare use. Although progress has been made toward these goals,
large disparities persist for American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders. These
groups have a high prevalence of risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias and are at greater
risk than other groups for under diagnosis of these disorders. Accordingly, the Natives Engaged in Alzheimer’s
Research Center will conduct community-based Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias studies within
American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander populations using methods and
instruments that yield accurate, reliable data. The Research Methods Core’s primary function is to collaborate
with individual Research Projects and Cores, sharing expertise to improve the scientific function of each
component of the Center. To be successful, our Research Projects and Cores require innovative designs with
measurable, achievable objectives; efficient resource allocation; appropriate implementation; regular,
meaningful evaluations; and appropriate statistical analyses. Accordingly, the Research Methods Core’s goals
are to make the most efficient use of study resources by standardizing methods for measurement and analysis
to the extent possible; to optimize internal and external study validity; and to ensure the relevance of inferential
analyses for healthcare providers, policymakers, community leaders, and other key stakeholders. The Research
Methods Core’s Specific Aims are to: 1) Integrate with each RP team and other Cores to provide state-of-the-
art methodological support for sample size and power calculations, study design, sampling, and implementation;
and proactively identify opportunities for disseminating best practices between Research Project teams and
Cores, as well as for cross-study collaboration; 2) Maximize the scientific validity of the Research Projects by a)
ensuring reliability and validity of study measures; b) standardizing methods for measurement, data collection,
and database design to the extent possible; and c) ensuring the reproducibility and transparency of Research
Project results; and 3) Apply a flexible and comprehensive quantitative and qualitative data analytic strategy that
leverages transdisciplinary Research Methods Core faculty expertise to implement the most reproducible
analyses for each Research Project’s Specific Aims. The Core will maximize scientific rigor while accommodating
the logistical and methodological challenges that arise in real-world research endeavors. It will leverage both the
skills of methodologists with years of experience working on multi-project grants, as well as numerous existing
partnerships. The collaboration between the Research Methods Core, Research Projects, and Cores will play a
critical role in ensuring that our work contributes to understanding and ameliorating Alzheimer’s disease and
related dementias disparities in American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders."
10883608,"RECRUITMENT AND ENGAGEMENT CORE: ABSTRACT
Many American Indian, Alaska Native (AI/AN), and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (NHPI) communities
view academic research with skepticism, mistrust, or even hostility, in part because research has historically
been done in or on communities rather than with community participation. As a result, community-informed
participatory approaches have become the model of choice for research with AI/ANs and NHPIs, because their
core values include equitable distribution of power and resources among partners and mutual respect for the
knowledge that partners offer. In 2013, the National Institute on Aging convened a workshop to articulate goals
for research on Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias as part of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's
Disease. A priority was the inclusion of disparity populations in research. However, AI/ANs and NHPIs have
been largely neglected by this work, despite striking increases in life expectancy among Native elders. For
example, the 32 current Alzheimer’s Disease Centers have recruited only 110 AI/ANs and 19 NHPIs in the last
7 years (average of 1 person every 2 years per center), despite existing recommendations to increase diversity.
The Recruitment and Engagement Core will apply strategies recommended by the National Institutes on Aging
for recruitment and retention in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) research,17 with a
commitment to innovative as well as traditional methods to engage communities. These strategies include a
network of 8 Satellite Centers led by AI/AN and NHPI investigators representing a diverse cross-section of
academic and community partners, which will extend the national impact of our work beyond our Research
Projects. These Centers will assess research readiness and through novel “Brain Train” hands-on workshops,
establish an IRB-approved registry of AI/ANs and NHPIs who wish to participate in ADRD research. Our Specific
Aims are to: 1) Monitor and evaluate recruitment and retention in Research Projects by applying innovative
strategies, and identifying best practices for ADRD outreach and engagement; 2) Assess community research
readiness and position AI/AN and NHPI sites for future ADRD studies through a network of Satellite Centers and
“Brain Train” ADRD workshops; 3) Build an IRB-approved research and information registry of AI/ANs and NHPIs
interested in ADRD research; and 4) Create educational and recruitment materials to increase awareness of
ADRD for use by the Research Projects in local communities and national venues. This Core will use strategies
designed to stoke interest in research and treatment advances, both in communities participating in the Research
Projects and in others and ensure stakeholder involvement in biospecimen collection and dissemination of
results. The AI/AN population is growing 3 times faster than the US general population, such that the number of
AI/ANs aged 65+ is expected to triple by 2050, while the number of those aged 85+ will increase 7-fold.19
Corresponding increases are expected for NHPIs. Thus it is imperative to engage the rapidly burgeoning
population of Native elders in ADRD research."
10883612,"BIOSPECIMEN CORE: ABSTRACT
American Indians and Alaskan Natives (AI/ANs) and Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders (NHPIs) are subject
to disparities in many health conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). Yet these
populations remain understudied, so that we lack the biospecimens and other data needed to identify their
biological and genetic risk factors for ADRD. The magnitude of the problem can be illustrated by the database
of the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center, which has collected APOE genotypes from only 135 AI/ANs
and 17 NHPIs over the past 30 years. The paucity of biomarker data is especially concerning because extant
literature suggests that the APOE ε4 allele is not associated with dementia among AIs or the Chamorro
people of Guam, in sharp contrast with findings on non-Indigenous US populations. Such population-
specific differences highlight the need for robust biospecimen collection among AI/ANs and NHPIs.
Unfortunately, few genetic studies have been conducted in their communities, as biospecimen collection is often
viewed negatively by AI/ANs, NHPIs, and other Indigenous populations. Yet, we have shown that AI/ANs are
more willing to engage in genetic research if community stakeholders help design projects, collect data, and
interpret results. Similar findings on biobanking have been reported for NHPIs. The Biospecimen Core will be
co-led by Dr. John Kauwe, a Native Hawaiian who is internationally known for his work on the genetics of ADRD
and other diseases; and Dr. Perry Ridge, an expert in bioinformatics and genomic sequencing of ADRD
biomarkers, both from Brigham Young University. This Core will have access to biospecimens donated by AI/ANs
and NHPIs through several sources, including NEAR Research Projects 2 and 3 and ""Brain Train"" workshops
conducted by our 8 Satellite Centers in areas of the US where 90% of AI/ANs and NHPIs reside. The Specific
Aims of the Biospecimen Core are to: 1) Isolate and store DNA from biospecimens collected from participants
in Research Projects, Satellite Center activities, and other sources. We expect to assemble ~2,700 saliva
samples linked to self-reported and objective data from AI/ANs and NHPIs and ~390 blood samples for future
biomarker studies; 2) Collect and validate genotypes for each saliva sample initially using the Illumina Omni2.5
array. These data will be used to evaluate genes and variants that confer ADRD risk, such as APOE; 3) Provide
annotated genotype data for key disease markers and polygenic risk scores for ADRD; and 4) Serve as a
resource for processing, storing, and cataloging biospecimens obtained by ongoing and future studies with other
AI/AN and NHPI cohorts. Biospecimens and datasets will be available through existing and new partnerships
that will elucidate the genetic risk in these groups. The National Institute on Aging is committed to ensuring
adequate representation of minorities in ADRD research. Our efforts will result in a large repository of hitherto
unavailable biospecimens collected from AI/ANs and NHPIs. Building this repository is vital to fulfilling the
Institute’s commitment and characterizing unique ADRD genetic risk and protective profiles in these populations."
10883615,"RESEARCH PROJECT 1: ABSTRACT
The American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) population is growing 3 times faster than the US all-races
population. The number of AI/ANs aged 65+ is expected to triple to 1,624,000 by 2050, while the number of
those aged 85+ will increase 7-fold to 300,000. These trends raise concerns about proportionate increases in
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) among AI/AN elders, and concurrent demands for ADRD
healthcare and services. Many AI/ANs obtain healthcare through a fragmented system that offers minimal
geriatric or specialty care and creates barriers to obtaining high-quality care, resulting in late or under-diagnosis
and inadequate care for ADRD. AI/AN elders typically receive their healthcare from primary care physicians
(PCPs), who often lack the training and resources needed to diagnose and manage ADRD. The focus of the
2016 Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Dementias Summit was on improving skills in the community by training
health professionals in dementia diagnosis, care, and research. PCPs are especially well-placed to detect
mild cognitive impairment, which is often undiagnosed. While studies suggest that clinic-level interventions can
improve ADRD diagnosis and care, no pragmatic trial has focused on facilities or PCPs that serve AI/ANs. In
partnership with an urban clinic serving AI/ANs, we therefore designed “INdians Transforming Alzheimer’s Care
Training” (INTACT), a clinic-level intervention to improve ADRD diagnosis and quality of care for AI/ANs. The
active principal component of INTACT is PCP training in screening, diagnosis, and care for ADRD. Other
elements include patient and family education, culturally informed videos, and brochures to create a “dementia-
friendly clinic”. First, we will conduct key informant interviews with PCPs in rural clinics to adapt the existing
version of INTACT for delivery in rural settings. Second, we will test INTACT with a group-randomized trial at 14
urban and 14 rural clinics that provide primary care to AI/ANs using a wait-control design. At the clinic level, we
will rely on electronic medical records to document INTACT’s effect on new ADRD diagnoses. At the PCP level,
we will test whether INTACT increases self-reported knowledge and confidence in dementia assessment, ADRD
care, and caregiver support. Third, we will evaluate INTACT’s effect on clinic- and patient-level outcomes.
Although we will not collect data directly from patients, we will examine patient-level quality of care metrics
documented in electronic medical records for AI/ANs with ADRD. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Adapt INTACT
for use in rural clinics serving AI/ANs; 2) Conduct a GRT to test INTACT’s effects on PCP knowledge of ADRD,
care confidence, and practice behavior; and 3) Evaluate INTACT’s effect on clinic-level outcomes (new
diagnoses) and patient-level quality of care outcomes (e.g., treatments commonly used for ADRD). The rapid
growth of the elderly AI/AN population forecasts a ballooning number of Native elders at risk of ADRD. This study
will be one of the few trials of a clinic-level intervention that foregrounds PCP education and training to improve
ADRD care, and the only one designed for AI/AN communities."
10883620,"RESEARCH PROJECT 2: ABSTRACT
The prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) is rising in Hawai`i, where it is projected
that 10% of people aged 65+ will be diagnosed with ADRD by 2025. Nationwide, Native Hawaiians and Pacific
Islanders (NHPIs) are more likely to have early-onset ADRD than Whites, Asians, and African Americans. NHPIs
have a higher prevalence of hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemia than other US racial and ethnic
groups, which increase the likelihood of ADRD. ADRD is often preceded by subjective cognitive impairment and
mild cognitive impairment, which offers an opportunity for early intervention to prevent or delay ADRD onset.
Interventions that promote physical activity, healthy diet, and social and cognitive activities can prevent or slow
cognitive decline. Notably, dancing can preserve or improve cognitive functioning and neuroimaging parameters,
while reducing vascular risk factors. However, very few studies have tailored a dance program for ADRD
prevention for racial or ethnic minorities, and none have included NHPIs. We completed a randomized controlled
trial of an intervention featuring Hula in 277 NHPIs with uncontrolled hypertension. Over 6 months, the
intervention lowered systolic (-5.4 mmHg, p = 0.02) and diastolic (-4.4 mmHg, p = 0.01) blood pressure
compared to the control condition. We therefore will partner with 5 community-based organizations in Hawai‘i to
adapt our existing Hula intervention and test its effectiveness for improving vascular health and maintaining or
improving cognitive function in NHPI elders at high risk of ADRD. The ‘IKE Kupuna (Elder Wisdom) Project will
use qualitative methods to revise our existing 12-month Hula curriculum for hypertension with culturally informed
dietary education, cognitive exercises, and social engagement strategies. We will then conduct a pragmatic
group-randomized trial with 208 NHPIs aged 50-75 years with at least 1 of 4 modifiable vascular risk factors for
ADRD (hypertension, hyperglycemia, obesity, or dyslipidemia) and either SCI or MCI using a wait-list control
design. The primary outcomes will be vascular risk factors for ADRD and subjective cognitive complaints.
Secondary outcomes will include measures of cognitive performance, physical function, and mental health. We
will also collect biospecimens from all participants to evaluate the cross-sectional association between APOE
genotype, vascular risk factors, and cognitive complaints and function. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Adapt our
existing Hula-based intervention to target vascular risk factors for dementia, improve cognitive symptoms or
function, and optimize salience, implementation, and adherence in NHPIs with subjective cognitive impairment
or mild cognitive impairment; 2) Conduct a group randomized trial to test the effect of ‘IKE Kupuna on vascular
risk factors for ADRD and cognitive complaints and function over 12 months; and 3) Evaluate the cross-sectional
association of vascular risk factors and APOE genotype with cognitive complaints and function. The NHPI elder
population is increasing and their needs are escalating. This will be the first study to test a novel intervention to
address ADRD in NHPIs and to assess the association APOE-ε4 genotype with cognitive function in this group."
10872308,"Background: Mounting evidence suggests that dysregulated epigenetic modifications play a crucial role in
cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis. Epigenetic regulations include histone modifications, DNA
methylation and demethylation, regulations through microRNA and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and
RNA methylation and editing. RNA methylation occurs on all messenger RNA (mRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA)
and ribosome RNA (rRNA). Compared to the recent advances in understanding mRNA methylation, the
function of rRNA methylation is understudied.
 The epigenetic modifier Polycomb group protein EZH2, a well-known oncogenic histone lysine
methyltransferase for H3K27 methylation and a key component of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), is
upregulated in cancer and is a biomarker of aggressive cancers. Our preliminary data show that EZH2 directly
interacts with FBL (Fibrillarin), the only characterized rRNA 2’-O-ribose methyltransferase, and regulates rRNA
2’-O-methylation levels. Knocking down EZH2 alters FBL-mediated nascent peptide synthesis, IRES-driven
protein translation initiation, and other ribosomal functions. Importantly, our data reveal that FBL is upregulated
in PCa, and EZH2highFBLhigh PCa patients had worse clinic outcomes compared to other patients.
Objective/Hypothesis: Our overall hypotheses are that EZH2 plays dual roles in PCa, a canonical role
as histone methyltransferase and a non-canonical role by directly interacting with FBL and then
regulating rRNA methylation and ribosomal functions. Further, this novel EZH2 function is
independent of the PRC2 complex and its lysine methyltransferase activity. Overexpression of EZH2
and FBL together will promote PCa progression.
 Based on our preliminary data, we propose the following specific aims to test our hypotheses.
Specific Aim 1: To investigate how EZH2 regulates the assembly of box C/D snoRNP.
Specific Aim 2: To characterize the non-canonical functions of EZH2 in rRNA methylation and protein
 synthesis through its interaction with FBL in vitro.
Specific Aim 3: To examine the EZH2-FBL interaction and EZH2’s novel functions in vivo.
Impact: This work will dissect how EZH2 performs its dual role in cancer progression through its canonical
function as a H3K27 methyltransferase and a non-canonical function in rRNA methylation via FBL."

Abstract
This TR&D project focuses on metabolite weighted CEST MRI technologies for spatially resolved imaging of
several key metabolites (glutamate, myoinositol, creatine and lactate) that serve as biomarkers of a variety of
disease processes. To this end, it develops novel technologies including (i) deep learning approaches for B1 and
B0 correction of CEST images of different metabolites (ii) volumetric acquisition methods for improved spatial
resolution of the CEST weighted imaging of different metabolites and (iii) technologies for dynamic studies of
exercise mediated OXPHOS measurements in skeletal muscle, and (iv) CrCEST acquisition methods for
measuring the metabolic activity of human myocardium. These technologies are driven by 7 collaborations and
serve 8 service projects from within PENN and from other institutions distributed across the US. Successful
completion of the goals will lead to technologies that will have sustained impact on the field of biomedicine
through their contribution to the understanding of pathophysiological underpinnings of several disorders, and
through the use of these technologies as biomarkers for diagnosis and evaluation of therapeutic responses of
existing and novel therapies that constitute precision medicine strategies for patient care. In addition,
dissemination of these technologies to collaborators from PENN and institutions across the country and abroad,
and training of next generation of biomedical scientist and physician scientists, and potential opportunities for
commercialization of the technologies will have immense national impact."
10870137,"TR&D2: High Spatial and Temporal Resolution MRI Mapping of Oxygen Consumption in Humans
Project PI: Felix Wehrli, Ph.D.
Abstract
 Disturbance of oxygen metabolism is at the core of many degenerative and acquired disorders.
Therefore, knowledge of the metabolic rate of oxygen (MRO2), i.e. the rate of an organ’s O2 consumption,
expressed in moles or milliliter of O2 metabolized per minute and unit mass of tissue, is fundamental to
understanding tissue metabolism and one of the key physiologic parameters of interest to clinical medicine.
Substrate and oxygen delivery to the cells are both mediated by blood flow. Thus, quantification of MRO2
demands knowledge of both, the change in fractional blood oxygen content following substrate metabolization -
- usually expressed in terms of oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) -- and blood flow rate.
 MRI is the only imaging modality permitting truly noninvasive evaluation of MRO2. While blood flow can
be measured accurately and reproducibly to render it clinically practical, the measurement of OEF proves to be
a far more intricate problem. Two dominant approaches exploiting heme iron magnetism in hemoglobin’s deoxy
state have emerged; direct measurement of blood magnetic susceptibility via some form of quantitative
susceptibility mapping, or indirectly via measurement of blood water transverse relaxation resulting from rapid
exchange between intra- and extracellular erythrocyte compartments as well as water diffusion in the locally
induced magnetic fields.
 A number of embodiments of susceptometry-based oximetry, as well as T2-based whole-organ and
regional BOLD-based oximetry, conceived by the investigators in preliminary work, or published by others, have
shown promise. However, precision medicine demands robustness, accuracy and reproducibility of the derived
quantitative measures in order to be applicable to diagnosis and evaluation of treatment response. None of these
requirements are currently meet the necessary standard of rigor. Further, since the effects measured with any
of the above methods scale with field strength, a rigorous quantitative evaluation will be needed. To attain these
objectives, the present TR&D proposes to develop and validate; MRI-based imaging technologies for whole-
organ MRO2 measurement at high temporal resolution applicable to multiple organ systems (Aim 1), spatially
resolved MRO2 based on the principles of both calibrated and quantitative BOLD focusing on the human brain
(Aim 2); and full cross-validation and expansion to 7T field strength (Aim 3).
 The results of the proposed technology developments and dissemination of the ensuing methods within
the applicants’ institution and beyond, should provide effective means for the study of tissue energetics in
vascular-metabolic disorders in response to treatment and lifestyle changes. Implementation, testing and
validation of the new technologies, and their eventual translation to the clinic, will open new avenues for
evaluating oxygen metabolism in multiple organs, thereby providing robust quantitative metrics for evaluation of
patients with metabolic and degenerative disorders."

The goal of the NIH Common Fund’s Somatic Cell Genome Editing (SCGE) program is to take
advances in technologies aimed at genome editing and delivery system approaches to correct
disease-causing mutations developed in Phase I and translate these efforts into the clinic during
Phase II. The SCGE Translational Coordination and Dissemination Center (TCDC) at the
Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) will continue the efforts of the Phase I SCGE
Dissemination and Coordinating Center acting as the hub to support the three lab and clinical
trials-based initiatives in a coordinated effort to facilitate the dissemination of protocols, best
practices, SCGE results, and develop a network of collaboration. The SCGE TCDC at MCW
brings a team of experienced investigators, platforms for effective communication and tracking
of deliverables and milestones and demonstrated success in strategic collaborations within the
consortium. The overall goal for the SCGE TCDC is to support the SCGE Consortium and work
cooperatively with all initiatives, projects, and members to facilitate the objectives of the entire
SCGE Consortium. To accomplish this, the MCW TCDC will 1) build upon and extend the
current communication platforms to facilitate communication among participants, 2) develop the
infrastructure to collect, digest, annotate, integrate, and distribute data and resources generated
within the SCGE Consortium, and 3) create a robust platform for collaboration within the SCGE
Consortium and with outside partners. The MCW TCDC will create the infrastructure to develop
policies, track progress within the consortium, communicate within and beyond the consortium,
develop outreach and educational activities to support the process of moving pre-clinical studies
through the regulatory process, into clinical trials, and eventually to the patient. To disseminate
data and resources developed within the SCGE Consortium, the SCGE Platform will be
assembled to store, query, visualize, and analyze the outcomes of the SCGE initiatives. The
MCW TCDC team will facilitate the administrative and management activities to support the
overall success of the program."

Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) cause an emerging, chronic, and challenging to treat pulmonary disease
(PD) whose numbers now undeniably surpass tuberculosis cases in the United States (U.S.) and other
geographic regions globally. NTM infections are notoriously difficult and expensive to eradicate, prone to relapse
and reinfection, and refractory to current anti-mycobacterial therapies. The environmental niches of NTM also
remain largely ill-defined. This lack of knowledge contributes to the on-going frustration to understand where
these pulmonary infections are acquired. In the U.S., Hawai’i is a geographic hot spot for NTM PD. Our work in
Hawai’i revealed an abundance of respiratory important NTM including Mycobacterium abscessus subsp.
abscessus, Mycobacterium avium, and Mycobacterium chimaera in household and non-household water
biofilms and soil. A unique environmental factor that may impact NTM PD in Hawai’i is exposure to aerosol
pollutants from the Kīlauea volcano, one of the most actively erupting volcanoes on Earth. Fine volcanic ash
particles can be breathed deep into the lungs causing irritation and cough. But, is it possible for volcanic ash to
also carry infectious NTM? Through our data, we show microbiological culture of viable M. abscessus, M. avium,
and M. chimaera from ash recovered during the 2018 eruption of Kīlauea and also from the Kīlauea environment,
supporting the possibility of volcanic ash as a newly described fomite for NTM. We demonstrate Kīlauea ash is
not directly toxic to Kīlauea-derived NTM and that ash exposure reduces NTM control by human macrophages.
Our project’s broad, long-term objective is to elucidate the innate immunological mechanisms used by human
lung cells in response to NTM infection and aerosol pollutants such as volcanic ash, providing implications that
extend beyond Hawai’i with millions of people worldwide living within kilometers of actively erupting volcanoes.
Herein, we leverage our unique collection of volcanic ash and NTM isolates recovered from Kīlauea ash, the
Kīlauea environment, and other Hawai’i and non-Hawai’i samples to test the hypothesis that Kīlauea ash
exacerbates control of NTM infection by healthy lung cells through antagonizing NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated
pyroptosis defenses. In this proposal, we will: (i) Investigate the biological consequences of Kīlauea ash
exposures on Kīlauea NTM fitness in the absence of host cells and (ii) Determine the effect of Kīlauea ash on
NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis in clearance of NTM using primary human alveolar macrophages
and airway epithelial cells cultured at the air-liquid interface from healthy donors, but also introduce a new 3D
apical out airway epithelial organoid culture system to study innate immune responses to Kīlauea NTM and
Kīlauea ash. The study’s broad application will be a reduction in the biological uncertainties surrounding how
exposure to specific environmental respiratory pollutants of global significance such as volcanic ash influences
NTM survival inside and outside of healthy human lung cells, while simultaneously informing risk assessments
and therapeutic interventions in response to respiratory infections and volcanic ash exposures."

 Since 1994, the National Institute on Aging (NIA) has supported post-doctoral training for two
fellows per year as part of the RAND Postdoctoral Training Program in the Study of Aging. Here, we
are proposing that NIA extend funding for another five years in support of two fellows per year,
beginning in 2021.
 RAND offers a rich and unique environment for advanced training in the study of aging; that
environment is characterized by a strong emphasis on interdisciplinary research and is supported by 9
Centers dedicated to the study of myriad issues of relevance to research in aging, a diverse and
distinguished group of scholars, strong mentoring capabilities, excellent facilities and strong research
support services, and the availability of formal instruction in various research skills. All told, 46
researchers will participate as part of the training faculty. We plan to recruit our two fellows from recent
Ph.D.s in demography, economics, gerontology, psychology, sociology, or other relevant disciplines
who are just completing their degree or who have a few years of experience. The fellows will pursue
programs of advanced research training in the field of aging for up to two years.
 The postdoctoral program in aging at RAND offers highly individualized training to the fellows,
including on-the-job training in the study of aging issues and other training designed to enhance the
fellows' analytical and communication skills, and understanding of the responsible conduct of research.
Specifically, fellows can enroll in seminars in the Pardee RAND Graduate School (PRGS); participate in
courses offered by RAND's statistical, computing, survey, and communications experts; and attend
numerous seminars offered at RAND and neighboring universities. The Program Director, mentor, and
other training faculty and research support staff will help the fellows prepare research presentations for
professional meetings and papers for submission to journals. Fellows will also be encouraged to
develop a proposal for a research project (to be executed after completing their postdoctoral tenure) for
submission to a federal agency."
10862611,"Project Summary/Abstract:
The natural evolution of aortic dissection is notoriously unpredictable under current methods of evaluation and
management. There is an urgent need to more completely elucidate the biomechanical stability of type B aortic
dissections and identify signatures in the imaging data allowing for optimal patient classification based on aortic
fragility. The long-term goal is the development and validation of image-based analysis algorithms to classify
aortic stability and allow a personalized risk stratification for a given patient’s aortic geometry providing the basis
for optimizing clinical management. The overall objective of this proposal is to utilize modern approaches in
differential geometry, continuum mechanics, and computer vision to discover and characterize high-risk
geometric structures hidden within computed tomography angiography (CTA) data of fragile aortas. The central
hypothesis of this application is the existence of a fundamental link between aortic shape and aortic stability as
it relates to the risk of aortic dissection and fragility. The rationale for this work is development of an easily
translatable geometry and mechanics-based algorithm to predict dissection stability and intervention timing by
discovering a richer and more nuanced mapping of aortic shapes hidden in existing patient imaging data. The
central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) develop a modern geometric classification
for aortic shapes, 2) develop a computational model that provides the mechanism underpinning the shape
evolution of aortic dissections, and 3) develop a modern successor to the traditional ‘maximum diameter’
measure of aortic dissections that integrates geometric, finite element, and physiologic factors. Utilizing a large
pre-identified CTA data set of normal and dissected aortas at various stages of disease and intervention, aim 1
will use tools from computer vision to reduce aortic shape to distributions of shape index and curvedness. Aim 2
will utilize advanced morphoelastic finite element growth models to discover the biomechanical mechanism
underpinning aortic shape changes in aortic dissections and validate these models on patient specific geometries
over clinically relevant time periods. These novel shape and mechanical stability classifiers will be used in both
linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction methods to define aortic shape sub-spaces for different clinical
scenarios in aim 3. This proposal is innovative as it challenges the status quo of evaluation and treatment by
deploying novel measures and techniques that analyze clinically relevant aortic geometry and the evolution of
aortic shape. Every patient is taken to the operating room under the full intent of having a positive clinical
outcome. The research outlined is significant because it is expected to provide surgeons and patients a more
discriminative framework with which to make better informed management decisions concerning type B aortic
dissections and ultimately optimize outcomes."

TARGETING THE METABOLIC REGULATOR SIRT5 IN ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA. AML is an aggressive
hematologic malignancy with <30% long-term survival. The current therapy standard, chemotherapy alone or
combined with allogeneic stem cell transplant, has not changed for decades. Despite initial responses, most
patients eventually relapse, suggesting persistence of leukemia initiating cells in protective niches. Inhibitors of
FLT3 or mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 (IDH1/2) have expanded therapy options and validated the
paradigm of genotype-directed therapy. However, even with these new drugs, relapse is common and frequently
due to selection of subclones with resistance mutations in the drug target. Unlike FLT3 and IDH1/2 inhibitors,
the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax is active in multiple AML genotypes, indicating that targeting shared vulnerabilities
in a genotype-agnostic manner can be effective. Unfortunately many venetoclax-induced responses are not
durable as leukemia cells adapt by activating alternative anti-apoptosis mechanisms or by reprogramming
mitochondrial metabolism. Microenvironmental protection, intra-tumoral heterogeneity and metabolic flexibility
limit the utility of current AML therapies. To identify new therapy targets in AML, we adapted an shRNA screen
for testing primary AML cells under bone marrow microenvironment-like conditions. We discovered that many
AML patient samples are highly dependent on SIRT5, while normal CD34+ cells are not. SIRT5 is a lysine
deacylase implicated in the regulation of energy metabolic pathways, including oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS), fatty acid β-oxidation and glycolysis. SIRT5 knockdown (KD) reduces growth and increases
apoptosis in most AML cell lines, with consistent results upon disruption of SIRT5 using CRISPR/Cas9 or
NRD167, a novel cell-permeable SIRT5 inhibitor. Genetic absence of Sirt5 impairs in vitro transformation of
mouse hematopoietic cells by several myeloid oncogenes, including MLL-AF9, and attenuates leukemogenesis
in vivo. At a biochemical level, SIRT5 KD or inhibition with NRD167 is associated with reduced OXPHOS,
reduced glutathione levels and increased mitochondrial superoxide, suggesting that AML cells depend on SIRT5
to maintain redox homeostasis. Sirt5-/- mice are viable with minor metabolic abnormalities, suggesting that in
vivo inhibition of SIRT5 would be tolerated. We hypothesize that SIRT5 is a therapy target in AML and will test
this in three Specific Aims: (1) Identify and validate SIRT5-regulated metabolic pathways in normal and
AML stem and progenitor cells. (2) Identify biomarkers of sensitivity to SIRT5 inhibition in primary AML
cells. (3) Identify a potent, selective, and bioavailable SIRT5 inhibitor, starting from the NRD167 tool
compound. Our work will rigorously test whether SIRT5 is a therapy target in AML, clarify the mechanisms
underlying SIRT5 dependence, and identify potent and selective SIRT5 inhibitors for future clinical development."

Pulmonary arterial hypertension continues to be a devastating chronic disease. Despite a variety of new
therapies, this disease process remains highly morbid and fatal. Most therapies are only temporizing and are
minimally effective because of the insidious onset and late recognition of this disease process. Double lung
transplantation is the only effective treatment; however, because of scarcity of organs and listing inequities, most
patients are unlikely to receive a transplant while on the waiting list. Developing an effective long-term support
system that can offload the right ventricle and protect the pulmonary vasculature would provide a bridge of
support and potential for recovery or management on pharmacological support. The objective and long-term
goal of this project is to design a catheter that will eventually be coupled with a pulmonary support system that
can prolong the survival and enhance the ability to medically treat patients with pulmonary artery hypertension,
as well as provide a chance for those on the lung transplant waiting list to receive an organ. We intend to
accomplish this by developing an innovative dual lumen catheter that can be positioned and fixed for a prolonged
period of time using a novel engineering mechanism and will properly unload the right ventricle and pulmonary
vasculature via an inter-atrial configuration. This will further include an innovative monitoring system to monitor
and control flows and protect a deconditioned left ventricle, preventing left sided heart failure."

Hypertension is the most common comorbidity with HIV affecting over two thirds of women with HIV over forty
years of age. Hypertension is a prominent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) that is modifiable
through lifestyle behavior changes such as physical activity. On average, women with HIV engage in low levels
of physical activity particularly if they reside in the southeastern United States where CVD risk is substantial.
There are gaps in knowledge regarding the integration of lifestyle medicine approaches in HIV primary care.
Further, under-representation and low engagement are significant barriers to existing behavioral physical
activity interventions for women with HIV. The goal of the proposed Mentored Patient-Oriented Research
Career Development Award (K23) is to provide the essential training and professional scaffolding critical for Dr.
Crockett's career transition to independent clinical scientist focused on preventing and addressing
cardiovascular comorbidities in underserved populations. To achieve this goal Dr. Crockett will pursue formal
training in hypertension and cardiovascular health outcomes, advanced mixed methods research, adaptation of
behavioral health interventions, and intervention science. These training aims will be accomplished through the
wealth of institutional resources at the University of Alabama at Birmingham; close mentorship from experts;
formal training through courses and intensive workshops; attendance at local, national, and international
meetings; and professional development activities. This training will be applied to a research project that aims
to: (1) elucidate the barriers and facilitators to daily physical activity behavior among women with HIV and
hypertension using a social cognitive theory framework; (2) systematically adapt a prescriptive physical activity
intervention with peer support for women with HIV and hypertension; and (3) conduct a pilot clinical trial of the
adapted intervention to evaluate its acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary impact on systolic and diastolic
blood pressure. The research aims will be accomplished by conducting a mixed methods assessment of daily
physical activity behavior through objective measurement with accelerometers and experience sampling with
30 women with HIV and hypertension; using an evidence-based intervention adaptation framework (the
“ADAPT-ITT model”) with input from key stakeholders (i.e., women with HIV, healthcare workers) in focus
groups, expert consultations, and integration of the existing literature; and a randomized pilot intervention trial
with 50 women with HIV and hypertension. Results of the proposed study will form the foundation for an NIH
R01 application to evaluate the adapted intervention in a larger scale randomized controlled trial. The
complimentary training and research goals will ensure Dr. Crockett's transition to independent clinical
investigator and contribute to reducing the burden of CVD while improving quality of life among women with
HIV."

 Meta-analyses critically shape clinical recommendations and policy, but their credibility may be
undermined by both within-study biases (e.g., confounding in observational studies) and across-study biases
(e.g., filtering by publication bias). These biases can produce meta-analysis estimates that are too large, too
small, or in the wrong direction. Scientists, clinicians, and health policymakers are increasingly concerned
about these biases given recent empirical evidence that meta-analyses on the same topic can disagree with
one another and with the results of systematic replication studies, which are designed to minimize publication
bias by having independent investigators repeat published studies. This eroding confidence in the published
literature and in meta-analyses represents an epistemic turning point.
 This proposal develops and empirically validates an innovative, domain-independent statistical
framework for quantitatively synthesizing studies subject to within- and across-study biases. Aim 1 will thus
develop novel, domain-independent statistical sensitivity analyses will quantify how results of meta-analysis
estimates might be shifted by within- and across-study biases, that allow bias-corrected synthesis of studies
with these two forms of bias, and that forecast the likely range of results of new studies and the impact of
adding them to an existing meta-analysis. The methods will be made broadly accessible via user-friendly
websites and R software, and their use will be illustrated in meta-analyses on pediatric obesity. Aim 2 will
illustrate the methods' real-world impact and compare their performance to that of existing methods by using
the methods to characterize the credibility of Cochrane database meta-analyses. Aim 3 will involve a
collaboration with “ManyBabies'', an innovative initiative to conduct conceptual replications of landmark results
in developmental psychology. The results of these planned replications will be forecasted using the new
methods of Aim 1 as well as existing methods; the forecasts will be compared studies' results after they are
conducted, providing real performance benchmarks. Aims 2-3 will also provide online “dashboards” allowing
intuitive exploration of the results.
 The immediate-term goal is to develop methods and software that, unlike existing statistical methods,
assess the robustness of a given meta-analysis to the joint effects of within- and across-study biases; that
synthesize and compare results of meta-analyses with those of studies subject to less publication bias (e.g.,
replication studies); and that use potentially biased meta-analyses to plan the optimal design of new studies.
The long-term goal is to calibrate confidence in meta-analyses to more swiftly inform scientifically robust
conclusions that will improve practice and health policy."

Insulin produced by pancreatic β-cells is the key stimulus for glucose metabolism, and therefore it is critical
that insulin secretion is adjusted to changes in energy state. Insulin secretion is acutely regulated by nutrients
and hormones that change in response to feeding. If the fed state persists, as in overnutrition, adaptive control
mechanisms increasingly sensitize the insulin secretory response to meet the increased insulin demand.
However, long-term overnutrition can also become maladaptive and lead to β-cell failure and type 2 diabetes
(T2D). How β-cells read nutrient signals and translate these signals into adaptive and maladaptive responses
is poorly understood. Supported by this grant, we have shown that the nutrient-sensitive histone demethylase
LSD1 mediates nutrient-induced changes to the β-cell epigenome to regulate adaptative insulin secretion.
Specifically, we found that LSD1 modifies the epigenetic state of gene regulatory elements linked to β-cell
nutrient response genes, thereby modulating the amplitude of the insulin secretory response. Thus, LSD1
functions as an integration hub between the β-cell’s nutrient environment, the epigenome and transcriptional
output. Our preliminary studies further show that LSD1 inhibition is adaptive in a lean state, but becomes
maladaptive and promotes β-cell failure in obesity. The objective of this proposal is to determine the
mechanisms by which LSD1 senses nutrients and to gain insight into how metabolic cues converge on LSD1
and the epigenome to render the adaptive β-cell response maladaptive. We will employ state-of-the-art
approaches, encompassing novel mouse models, human islet experiments, single cell resolved mapping of
chromatin state and gene expression, and cutting-edge computational analyses. In Aim 1, we will determine
how LSD1 senses nutrients and regulates chromatin state in β-cells. To investigate the nutrient sensing
mechanism, we will manipulate LSD1’s metabolically regulated co-factor FAD and measure effects on LSD1-
regulated processes in β-cells. Furthermore, we will dissect LSD1’s enzymatic and non-enzymatic functions in
regulating the β-cell epigenome, using novel mouse models and in vitro experiments. In Aim 2, we will identify
mechanisms by which LSD1 inhibition triggers maladaptive processes that accelerate β-cell decompensation
in T2D. Employing genetic mouse and islet models of metabolic stress, we will manipulate LSD1 activity and
study how these manipulations affect β-cell chromatin state, gene expression, and phenotypes. In Aim 3, we
will examine the role of LSD1 in human β-cells. Here, we will leverage transcriptomic and chromatin maps we
generated from a collection of nondiabetic, prediabetic, and T2D donor islets to determine whether the LSD1-
regulated program contributes to β-cell failure in T2D. By unveiling fundamental mechanisms by which β-cells
interpret nutrient signals, this proposal will prove critical for identifying strategies to prevent or reverse
maladaptive processes and β-cell failure."

Fetal brain abnormalities (FBA) are one of the most common prenatal sonographic abnormality detected and
account for ~20% of birth defects posing a substantial burden on the health care system. FBA can be isolated
or syndromic and have vast phenotypic heterogeneity. The paired approach of prenatal diagnosis using
ultrasound to characterize aberrant phenotypes with genetic analysis to determine causal lesions has improved
the ability to accurately counsel families about diagnosis, prognosis, and recurrence risk. Recently, prenatal
exome sequencing (ES) has been applied in cases of lethal or multiple fetal abnormalities to determine a
molecular diagnosis that otherwise could not be identified with traditional testing. Our group and others using ES
have shown a diagnostic rate of 23.6% in cases of multiple fetal abnormalities, but only 2.6% in isolated FBA
abnormalities, indicating a need to improve diagnostic capabilities for FBA. We posit that the overabundance of
unresolved fetal cases is due to a gap in our understanding of the repertoire of genotypes underlying prenatal
FBA and limitations of population genetics to establish causality of rare variants in novel candidate genes. Our
team who is at the forefront of prenatal genetic diagnostics and in vivo zebrafish modeling of human disease will
overcome the current challenges of diagnosing prenatal FBA. We will intersect exome- and genome-wide
variation with a relevant model system (zebrafish).
We hypothesize that we will 1) generate initial discoveries
directly relevant to human brain development by modeling novel candidate FBA genes in zebrafish; and 2)
improve prenatal diagnosis for FBA using whole genome sequencing (WGS) and deep phenotyping. We will: 1.
Perform bioinformatic analysis of 200+ clinically ascertained fetuses with FBA and their parents using a tiered
filtering strategy on already available parent-fetus trio exome data 2. Perform WGS on 114 prospectively enrolled
fetuses and their parents paired with comprehensive prenatal and postnatal phenotypic data to further
characterize genotype/phenotype of FBA; 3. Establish relevance of candidate genes to FBA development and
determine variant pathogenicity using genome-editing and phenotyping tools in zebrafish. Our work will expand
the understanding of molecular processes governing human brain development, establish a clinical-research
hybrid platform readily applicable to FBA and other anatomical defects detectable by fetal imaging, build an
animal model of aberrant FBA development with potential for future use in therapeutic target identification. Our
immediate results will improve counseling/management of prenatally diagnosed FBA and lead to future work to
develop novel therapeutic and preventative strategies for FBA."

Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) are the central regulators of immunity and tolerance. Defects in Treg generation
and/or functions lead to lethal systemic autoimmune inflammation in both mice and human, demanding a tight
regulation of Treg homeostasis. Determining factors capable of modulating Treg function is thus a subject of
utmost importance. Among the factors is microRNA, a small non-coding RNA molecule known to regulate gene
expression. There is plethora of evidence that miRNAs play a critical role in Treg generation and functions.
However, our understanding the mechanisms by which Treg-derived miRNA modulates Treg functions is
relatively limited. Glucocorticoids are the frontline treatment option for many inflammatory diseases, including
autoimmunity and allergy. Despite the broad use, the precise immune suppressive mechanisms used by
glucocorticoids remain largely elusive. We recently reported that Tregs are indispensable during glucocorticoid-
induced treatment of chronic inflammation. Mechanistically, we uncovered that a novel miR-342 is induced by
glucocorticoid stimulation in Tregs and that miR-342 targets metabolic regulator, Rictor, to control Treg metabolic
programming. From the preliminary studies we also found that miR-342 is highly expressed in Tregs and that it
is further enhanced by dexamethasone (Dex) stimulation. Interestingly, miR-342 expression in Tregs appears to
be critical for Treg suppressive function. Moreover, miR-342 was also detected in the serum following Dex
treatment. To our surprise, Dex-induced serum miR-342 was detected in steroid-sensitive but not in steroid-
resistant inflammation. Based on the compelling evidence, we propose the hypothesis that miR-342 is a
glucocorticoid-induced miRNA in Tregs that plays a regulatory role in Tregs’ ability to control inflammation. Two
specific aims are proposed. First, we will determine the role of miR-342 in Treg functions. Two newly generated
animal models in which Tregs lack or overexpress miR-342 will be used. Second, we will examine the role of
Treg-derived miR-342 in steroid resistance. Identification of the mechanisms by which glucocorticoid-induced
miR-342 regulates Treg functions will open novel opportunities to develop therapies applicable to manage severe
inflammatory conditions including steroid resistance."

Benign urologic diseases of the lower urinary tract such as urinary tract infections, benign prostatic
hyperplasia, voiding dysfunction, urinary incontinence, interstitial cystitis, painful bladder syndrome, and
urethral strictures incur significant health care burden in the US. Our lack of a comprehensive molecular and
cellular understanding of these tissues in the normal and disease states has directly hindered the development
of effective novel therapies for these conditions. We are proposing to generate high-resolution transcriptome
and gene regulatory data set for healthy human ureter and bladder tissues across the lifespan in both sexes.
The overall goal is to construct a highly integrated cellular and molecular anatomical map of the ureter and
bladder in humans. This will enable us to comprehensively understand the cellular composition and lineage
relationships of the lower urinary tract system. Towards this aim, we have established a robust tissue
procurement and processing workflow. This allows us to recover the lower urinary track en bloc from deceased
organ donors and process them, with high cell viability and tissue integrity, for molecular assays. We propose
to collect scRNA-seq and Visium spatial transcriptomics data on organ donors in 3 age groups that reflect
distinct physiological states in terms of lower urinary tract functions across the human life span. For each
donor, we will analyze five specified anatomic locations, lower ureter, dome, ureteral orifice, bladder neck, and
urethra, to comprehensively characterize parts of the lower urinary tract that have unique tissues structures
and functions. We will use these data to understand the lineage relationships between the different cell types
and validate novel markers for each novel cell type by immunostaining. Finally, we will perform scATAC-seq on
the most informative tissue locations to gain further insight into the underlying gene regulatory networks.
Together these studies will provide, for the first time, a comprehensive analysis of the human bladder and
ureter throughout life. These molecular data will become a valuable resource to the research community and
ultimately, support efforts in organ repair and regeneration."

Myosin Vb (MYO5B) is a motor protein that is critical for cell polarization and protein trafficking towards the
apical membrane in epithelial cells. Inactivating MYO5B mutations cause the congenital diarrheal disease,
microvillus inclusion disease (MVID), which leads to life-threatening diarrhea and malabsorption. In MYO5B
knockout mice, as well as in MVID patient intestines, apical proteins that mediate nutrient and water absorption
are mis-localized away from the brush border of intestinal epithelial cells. We recently found that a bioactive
phospholipid, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), can promote microvillus maturation and normalize localization of
sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter 1 and sodium/proton exchanger (NHE)3, important apical sodium
transporters that promote water absorption, both in MYO5B knockout tissues and organoids. However, LPA
injection did not significantly improve body weight loss induced by conditional MYO5B knockout in mice. We
hypothesize that the low solubility and fast degradation of natural LPA limit delivery of a sufficient dosage to
ameliorate intestinal deficits in vivo, and that potent LPA receptor (LPAR) agonists are more efficient. We
synthesized selective agonists for LPAR1 and LPAR5. Our preliminary data indicate that the LPAR5 agonist,
Compound-1, significantly improved villus/crypt ratios and apical NHE3 localization in MYO5B knockout mice.
We anticipate that LPAR5 activation can stimulate enterocyte differentiation and apical membrane trafficking
that bypass the blockades induced by loss of MYO5B function, leading to improved microvillus and villus
structure, nutrient transporter localization, and nutrient absorption. First, we will evaluate the therapeutic
potential of LPAR5 agonist treatment on epithelial cell function in mice with inactivating MYO5B mutations. In
addition to MYO5B deletion models, we will evaluate the effects of Compound-1 on mice with a G519R point
mutation in MYO5B (identified in a severe MVID patient). In addition to the mis-trafficking of nutrient
transporters, we have found that functional MYO5B loss induces cell lineage differentiation deficits. MYO5B
knockout mice show increased numbers of Paneth cells along with hyperproliferation, while sensory tuft cells
are reduced by 80%. LPA treatment reversed the tuft cell reductions in MYO5B knockout mice, suggesting that
LPA signaling enhances proper cell differentiation. Second, to specify MYO5B function in progenitor cells,
Myo5bflox/flox mice will be crossed with Lrig1-CreERT2 mice and the effects on epithelial proliferation and
differentiation will be characterized with or without Compound-1 treatment. Third, to understand the
mechanisms that underlie the hyperproliferation and differentiation deficits, we will determine the alterations in
cellular metabolic pathways in MYO5B-deficient mouse intestine before and after LPAR5 activation. We will
utilize imaging mass spectrometry techniques to provide spatial and quantitative metabolomics data in situ.
The use of potent and soluble LPAR5 agonist as a treatment for malabsorption may provide a safer alternative
to transplantation or life-long TPN in children with MVID as well as general diarrheal symptom."

has focused on the histone demethylase activity of KDM5 proteins, which targets the active chromatin mark
H3K4me3. However, KDM5 proteins can also regulate transcription through non-enzymatic mechanisms. While
KDM5 is essential for development, its demethylase activity is not required, as is demonstrated by the viability
of demethylase-dead adult flies. In this work, we will examine essential functions of KDM5 via a novel truncation
allele, kdm5Q19, which does not alter demethylase activity. kdm5Q19 inserts a stop codon in a previously
unrecognized, evolutionarily conserved, motif within an intrinsically disordered region of KDM5 at the C-terminus.
kdm5Q19 animals do not survive to adulthood, which is distinct from null, demethylase dead, and other mutants
generated in our lab, suggesting that the motif disrupted by the truncation has an essential as-yet-unknown role
in normal KDM5 function. To further dissect the molecular activities of this region of KDM5, we generate
additional alleles of kdm5 to refine the critical region(s) of the protein and assess viability and changes to
transcription.
In this work, we will (1) define essential regions within KDM5 required for viability, and to characterize their roles
in development (2) define the essential molecular functions imparted by the C-terminus of KDM5. Together,
these studies will refine the critical region(s) of the C-terminus of KDM5, and define the normal role of these
regions in regulating transcription."

The T cell co-inhibitory checkpoint programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) plays a critical role in the maintenance of
peripheral immunological tolerance. However the PD-1 pathway can be co-opted by chronic pathogens and
tumor cells to promote immune evasion. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) using antibodies that block the PD-
1/PD-L1 ligand interactions have demonstrated remarkable success in cancer clinical trials. Despite inducing
durable responses in a subset of patients, most patients do not develop stable remission after therapy. Therefore,
it is critical to understand the immunological and cellular features associated with response and resistance to
ICB. Metabolic remodeling is intrinsically linked to the development, differentiation and activation of immune
cells, including anti-tumor T cells. Yet, little is known about the metabolic vulnerabilities of anti-tumor T cells,
including metabolic pathways that govern the reinvigoration of exhausted anti-tumor T cells during ICB therapy.
 Our preliminary studies identified asparagine synthetase (Asns) as a novel metabolic regulator of the anti-
tumor CD8+ T cell response to anti-PD-1 therapy and provided evidence for a central role for asparagine
metabolism in regulating the efficacy of anti-PD-1 treatment in CD8+ T cell-mediated control of tumors. We will
test this hypothesis in two aims: 1) Define the metabolic pathway(s) regulated by asparagine metabolism in anti-
tumor CD8+ T cells and 2) Determine the role of asparagine metabolism in regulating CD8+ T cell exhaustion in-
vivo during PD-1 blockade. In Aim 1 we will systematically determine the metabolic mechanism(s) by which
asparagine regulates CD8+ T cells by comparing wild-type and CRISPR/Cas9-edited Asns-/- anti-tumor CD8+ T
cells. The fate(s) and contribution(s) of asparagine to distinct metabolic pathways, protein synthesis, and cytolytic
T cell activity will be assessed using isotopically labeled forms of asparagine, aspartate and glutamine in a novel
co-culture system with T cells and tumor cells. Aim 2 will comprehensively interrogate the roles of asparagine
metabolism, including asparagine synthesis and uptake, by leveraging functional genomic perturbation
approaches to target asparagine synthetase and the asparagine transporter SLC15A in exhausted CD8+ T cells
during anti-PD-1 treatment in tumor bearing-mice. Combinatorial approaches in which asparagine is
supplemented or pharmacologically depleted will reveal how modulation of this pathway regulates anti-tumor T
cell function and synergizes with ICB.
 Our research is conceptually novel and will address an important gap in our understanding of metabolic
circuits critical for the maintenance and functional responses of exhausted anti-tumor CD8+ T cells during anti-
PD-1 therapy. Since little is known about metabolic pathway usage and vulnerabilities of T cells within a nutrient
limited tumor microenvironment, the identification and successful validation of asparagine metabolism as a
central metabolic node that regulates anti-PD-1 efficacy may ultimately enable novel clinical strategies to improve
the clinical response to ICB therapy by providing metabolic support to T cells."

Recent research highlights pivotal roles of epigenetic reprogramming in health and disease. There is evidence
that epigenetic reprogramming in the hypothalamus is linked to obesity. The hypothalamus encompasses core
neural circuits controlling energy balance, body weight, and metabolic homeostasis. Of note, >95% of known
human obesity-related genes affect brain neural pathways and activities. However, transcription factors and
epigenetic enzymes responsible for epigenetic reprogramming of hypothalamic neurons are unknown. Slug is
a transcriptional repressor and known to promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition in development and cancer
metastasis. Slug binds to E2 boxes via its C-terminal DNA-binding domain, and its N-terminal SNAG domain
binds to EZH2 and HDAC1/2 and recruits the epigenetic enzymes to target promoters/enhancers. EZH2 is the
catalytic subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2, and catalyzes, in conjunction with EED (a structural
subunit), di- and tri-methylations of histone 3 lysine-27 (H3K27me2/3), repressive epigenetic marks. We found
that Slug is expressed in a subset of hypothalamic neurons and upregulated in obesity. Deletion of Slug in
long-form leptin receptor LepRb-expressing neurons protects against high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity, type
2 diabetes, and liver steatosis. Likewise, deletion of Slug in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) also
mitigates HFD-induced obesity. Conversely, overexpression of wild-type Slug, but not epigenetic-defective
mutants, in the mediobasal hypothalamus promotes obesity and metabolic disorders. Remarkably, central
injection of EZH2-selective or EED-selective inhibitors ameliorates obesity induced by either Slug
overexpression or HFD feeding. Hypothalamic leptin signaling and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
signaling are known to protect against obesity and metabolic syndromes. We observed that Slug directly binds
to the LepRb promoter and induces H3K27me2/3, thereby suppressing LepRb expression. Slug also
suppresses BDNF expression in the hypothalamus. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that Slug
assembles EZH2/EED epigenetic complexes on the promoters/enhancers of LepRb, BDNF, and other obesity
genes, which deposit H3K27me2/3 to repress the genes. Hypothalamic SLUG/EZH2/EED epigenetic
reprogramming drives the development of obesity and metabolic disorders. We further propose that
pharmacological reversal of the SLUG/EZH2/EED epigenetic reprogramming mitigates obesity and metabolic
disease. We will test these hypotheses in three aims. Aim 1 is to determine whether VMH Slug promotes
obesity by an epigenetic mechanism. Aim 2 is to determine whether EZH2/EED1 complex mediates SLUG’s
pro-obesity action. Aim 3 is to determine whether EZH2 and EED inhibitors mitigate obesity and metabolic
disease by reversing SLUG/EZH2/EED epigenetic reprogramming. The outcomes are expected to establish a
new hypothalamic SLUG/EZH2/EED epigenetic paradigm in the field of obesity and metabolic disease."
10889174,"In the U.S., about 12% of women have impaired fecundity and 7% of couples have infertility, with 1/3 attributable
to female factors. Underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown, however, even when more proximal
pathologies are identified, thus precluding the development of accurate diagnostics and personalized therapies.
In addition, pregnancies in subfertile women, conceived naturally or as a result of infertility treatments, have
greater risk of complications such as pre-eclampsia, preterm birth, and fetal growth restriction that have life-long
effects on the offspring. Thus, dissecting the mechanisms underlying reproductive success and compromise at
the genomic, molecular, and cellular level is crucial to the health and well-being of this and future generations.
Engaging investigators from multiple disciplines and building a sustainable pipeline of junior investigators,
including those underrepresented in science and medicine, is also essential to this effort, as is the promotion of
public literacy about reproductive health and science. These are core principles of our NIH National Center for
Translational Research in Reproduction and Infertility (NCTRI) at the University of California San Francisco
(UCSF), funded since 2007 and for which this new proposal is submitted with a new central theme focused on
the inter-related roles of endometrial inflammation, epigenetics, and developmental processes of the peri-
implantation uterus and early conceptus as central determinants of early pregnancy success or failure. This
focus is motivated by the fact that the clinical association between pathological endometrial inflammation and
female infertility, while well-established, lacks a deep mechanistic understanding. Our proposed Center is
comprised of three inter-related Research Projects and a pilot project (to be determined), supported by an
administrative core (A), and an education/outreach core (B). Project 1 (Roan/Huddleston, co-Leads) focuses
on the phenotypes and functions of endometrial lymphocytes in the normal and inflamed human endometrium
and decidua, including determinations of T and B cell antigen specificities. Project 2 (Erlebacher) focuses on
how epigenetic processes active within endometrial and decidual stromal cells control, and are in turn controlled
by, endometrial and decidual inflammation. Lastly, Project 3 (Blelloch/Fisher, co-Leads) addresses how
primitive trophoblasts of the extra-embryonic tissues that comprise the fetal portion of maternal-fetal interface
differentiate into the subtypes that determine the polarity of the implanted conceptus with respect to the decidua.
We believe our Center will also advance reproduction and infertility research more generally by setting an
example of successful transdisciplinary collaboration built upon the shared use of rare clinical specimens
analyzed through complementary, multi-omics approaches combined with mechanistic investigations using
model systems. Our Center also is designed to attract students, fellows, and junior scientists to careers in
reproduction and infertility research, and to engage the community with regards to the importance of infertility
research."
10898906,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is optimally treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by
radical cystectomy (RC), whereby ~35% of patients will have a pathologic complete response (pCR). Given the
morbid, complicated, and expensive nature of RC and the well-established pCR rate, there is a groundswell of
interest in RC avoidance for patients achieving pCR. However, identifying pCR clinically (as opposed to
pathologically) is an inaccurate process. In published studies, patients who avoid RC after being deemed clinical
complete responders have a 25-60% likelihood of recurrence, metastasis, or bladder cancer mortality. Better
tools to assess residual disease status are needed.
 To address this need, we developed a urine biopsy test which we call UTeRD (Urine Test for Residual
Disease). In UTeRD, DNA is isolated from urine and subjected to next generation sequencing to detect point
mutations in a targeted panel of genes. Using UTeRD, most mutations in tumor tissue are detectable as
mutations in urine. Further, presence or absence of residual MU after completion of chemotherapy strongly
associates with residual disease or pCR at the time of RC, respectively. Therefore, UTeRD could be used after
neoadjuvant therapy to better identify patients for RC avoidance.
 Although UTeRD performs well in distinguishing patients with pCR from residual disease, the negative
predictive value (NPV) of UTeRD is only 76%, some urine samples were nondiagnostic, and a urinary DNA
preservation protocol needs to be developed in order for the test to be widely adopted. Pre-analytical factors
and methodology improvements which we believe will increase the NPV and decrease nondiagnostic rates will
be studied in Aim 1. In Aim 2, we will determine if urine preservatives can be used to facilitate shipping to a
centralized lab without loss of fidelity of the test. Lastly, in Aim 3, we will determine if the absence of mutations
from a urine biopsy is associated with pCR regardless of the pre-surgical therapy. To answer this question,
samples obtained on 5 prospective MIBC clinical trials from multiple institutions will be studied using the
optimized protocols identified through this research.
 The research team is comprised of a urologist, medical oncologists, a radiation oncologist, a statistician,
a computational biologist who are experts in their fields. The skills and contributions of the team are
complimentary and will culminate in the development of a unique and robust biomarker that addresses a
significant clinical need using a one-of-a-kind sample cohort. UTeRD may enhance the ability of a bladder cancer
clinician to answer highly relevant clinical question, namely, “Does this patient have residual disease after pre-
surgical therapy, and therefore, will he/she benefit from RC?”"

This award will accelerate my long-term goal to develop microphysiological systems to improve human
pharmacological efficacy with reduced toxicity and reliance on small animal models. Models of the
cardiovascular system (vascular, myocardium, adrenal medulla) in vitro have primarily been limited to simplified
2D structures and have not evaluated for tissue-tissue interactions. As such, the structure/function relationships,
and the cell-cell interactions driven by tissue organization and innervation remain poorly understood. Thus, MPS
that recapitulates key components of the human cardiovascular system, including physiologically relevant shear
flow, oxygen saturation, bioelectric stimulation, primary human endothelial, smooth muscle, cardiomyocytes,
chromaffin cells, and human autonomic neurons would be a valuable tool for advancing scientific discovery,
healthcare, compound screening, and biomedical research. Current MPS generally utilize specialized equipment
and traditional microfabrication techniques via soft lithography with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), making
microfluidic plumbing difficult as well as nearly impossible control of oxygen, and potential for analyte loss.
Therefore, new fabrication approaches that deviate from PDMS are needed. Our approach here describes the
application of a laser-fabricated, cut and assembled MPS for a fully humanized system. There is a scientific
and clinical urgency for the development of new tools to identify compound toxicity and decrease new
compound attrition during clinical trials. By applying my strengths in biomaterials, organ-chip design,
bioelectronics, and neuroengineering, we will accelerate the development of robust 3D, instrumented MPS
platforms of the cardiovascular system. A fundamental issue addressed in this project will be the ability to
integrate, in a scalable platform, instrumentation for stimulation and recording of neural, adrenal, and cardiac
activity to better elucidate the impact of the autonomic nervous system and compound toxicity. We will harness
a statistical model to identify driving factors in cell fate, function, and identify sex-based differential responses in
autonomic balance on the MPS. These innovative models will integrate recent advances in stem cell
differentiation and our proven ‘cut & assemble’ fabrication method to broadly disseminate these organ platforms."

Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability around the world and disproportionately affects older adults.
After a stroke, older adults commonly exhibit gait dysfunction (e.g., slow, unstable, asymmetric walking), which
is the top patient-reported rehabilitation target. In addition to motor deficits, approximately 70% of people living
with chronic stroke also have post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI). While post-stroke gait rehabilitation
interventions effectively mitigate gait dysfunction in aging adults, there remains a significant degree of inter-
individual variability in walking outcomes. We posit this is because current gait rehabilitation interventions are
predominantly structured to leverage explicit versus implicit locomotor learning. Importantly, explicit motor
learning is cognitively demanding. It occurs through intentional changes to a movement based on external
feedback and relies primarily on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Whereas, implicit motor learning is
cerebellum-dependent and occurs more automatically in response to proprioceptive feedback. Despite evidence
of shared neural resources between cognitive and motor processing, the impact of PSCI on the capacity for
these forms of motor learning during walking remains largely unexplored. The overall goal of this proposal is to
demonstrate that PSCI moderates explicit, but not implicit, locomotor learning in older adults with chronic stroke
and identify the role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in this relationship. Under this career development
award, the PI (Leech) will develop skills in neuropsychology, structural neuroimaging, and advanced statistics.
This training will promote the achievement of her long-term career goal: as an independent investigator, to
develop effective, comprehensive, individualized interventions to reduce disability in older adults. This project
has three research aims. Aim 1 will determine the impact of PSCI severity on explicit locomotor learning in older
adults post-stroke. Aim 2 will test the impact of the PSCI severity the capacity for implicit locomotor learning in
the same group of participants. Finally, Aim 3 will examine the role of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex structural
integrity in explicit locomotor learning post-stroke. Older adults with chronic stroke who have a range of PSCI
severity will complete the procedures necessary for all three aims over a total of 2 experimental sessions. We
expect to show that PSCI severity limits an individual’s capacity to learn a more symmetric walking pattern
through explicit, but not implicit, locomotor learning and that this relationship will be mediated by the structural
integrity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. This work will provide necessary scientific foundation for a program
of research to develop an individualized gait rehabilitation intervention anchored to cognitive impairment and a
comprehensive predictive model of locomotor learning in older adults post-stroke."

People with intellectual or developmental disabilities (IDD)—a sizeable and growing population—now live
longer and enjoy better quality of life than in prior decades. However, this group still suffers from excess
morbidity, especially during adolescence and young adulthood, the time when they are expected to make
health care transitions (HCTs) from child-centered to adult-oriented health care systems. Although it is likely
that some adolescents and young adults with IDD experience high-quality HCTs, our understanding of how
HCTs proceed longitudinally, in vivo for large populations of adolescents and young adults with IDD is
extremely limited. At a population level, we do not know the ages at which HCTs start or end or whether the
timing depends on the type of physicians involved. Additionally, scant data exist regarding how health care
quality changes for this population during HCTs and the role insurance gaps may play in disrupting that care
quality.
The proposed study combines three recently developed claims-based tools to create one of the largest,
longitudinal, and multi-payer datasets of adolescents and young adults with IDD to date. It uses five years of
all-payer claims databases (2014–2018) in three states to identify individuals aged 10–28 with IDD (69,000
persons in Colorado, 85,000 persons in Massachusetts, and 217,000 persons in New York). It then pursues
the following four Aims: (1) to characterize HCTs for adolescents and young adults with IDD in terms of the
types of physicians involved and the ages across which transfers occur; (2) to assess the quality of care
received by people with IDD during the ages at which HCTs occur; (3) to characterize insurance gaps
associated with Medicaid age 19 eligibility rules; and (4) to examine the relationship between insurance gaps
following Medicaid’s eligibility redetermination at age 19 and clinical care quality using quasi-experimental
methods.
This study will establish much-needed basic facts about how HCTs proceed for adolescents and young adults
with IDD so that doctors, nurses, and allied health professionals can help develop delivery system, insurance,
and payment policy interventions that better create health among adolescents and young adults with IDD. It is
novel in the database it creates for study, the features of HCTs that it will quantify, its assessment of care
quality, and its use of quasi-experimental methods to examine the relationship between insurance gaps around
the time of Medicaid’s age 19 eligibility rules and the health of adolescents and young adults with IDD.
This research addresses the NICHD’s strategic priority to “improve the transition from adolescent to adult
health care…for [those] with disabilities” and the Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Branch’s priorities
to “understand the complexity of comorbid symptoms [of IDD]” and “promote…treatments for IDD that will
impact clinical care.”"

Throughout life, humans and other animals adapt their hearing to perceive features of sound that are important
for successful behavioral decisions. Normal-hearing humans are able to detect and discriminate important
sounds in crowded noisy scenes and to understand the speech of individuals the first time they meet.
However, patients with peripheral hearing loss or central processing disorders often have problems hearing in
these challenging settings. Even when they can perceive sounds accurately, the additional listening effort
required negatively impacts other cognitive functions. A better understanding of how the healthy auditory
system operates in cognitively challenging contexts will support new treatments for these deficits.
This project will study how the auditory system represents sound information as it operates in challenging
acoustic environments. There are three specific aims. First, high-density microelectrode arrays will be used to
record the simultaneous activity of neural populations in auditory cortex during behaviors that require detecting
sounds masked by noise or learning new sound-reward associations. Recording from multiple neurons will
enable characterizing how information is encoded by the simultaneous activity of neural populations. These
experiments will test the hypothesis that population activity in auditory cortex generates representations that
are invariant to irrelevant distracting sounds. Second, optogenetic tools will be used to identify distinct neuronal
cell types (excitatory versus inhibitory) in cortex. This study will test the hypothesis that tonic activation of
inhibitory neurons can explain changes in population activity during behavior. Third, machine learning tools will
be used to model the simultaneously recorded neural activity. These experiments will test the hypothesis that
neurons in the same local anatomical circuit in auditory cortex encode information about a relatively small
domain in the space of all possible auditory stimuli. Models fit to experimental data will also describe how
changes in behavioral state shift the way neurons encode sounds and describe sources of correlated
population activity that impact neural discriminability during behavior. Together these experiments will establish
new links between neural representation of sound and the cognitive processes that extract important
information from sound for successful behavior."

Current approaches to classifying critical illness focus on broad clinical syndromes including sepsis and the
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, application of consensus definitions of these
syndromes has not translated to syndrome-specific, targeted therapies. Recent transformative studies of
ARDS have revealed underlying (latent) biological phenotypes, termed hyper- and hypo-inflammatory, that are
remarkably consistent across multiple ARDS cohorts. Further, in post hoc analysis, these phenotypes respond
differentially to both process of care (fluids, PEEP) and pharmacologic (simvastatin) treatments. These findings
suggest that biological phenotyping in ARDS, pneumonia and sepsis may pave the way towards a deeper
understanding of the biology of critical illness that will translate, for the first time, into targeted, personalized
therapies. Our multidisciplinary team of investigators and clinical enrollment sites brings together deep
scientific expertise in pathophysiologic mechanisms and phenotyping of ARDS, sepsis and pneumonia, world-
class infrastructure for collecting long-term outcomes after critical illness, strong experience in designing and
implementing observational clinical cohort studies that include long-term follow-up, and proven ability to enroll
large numbers of critically ill patients in observational and clinical studies. Our team proposes two studies: (1) a
Consortium-wide 5,000 patient observational cohort study, the MUltidimenSional phenotyping In Critical care
(MUSIC) Study. The primary Aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that latent phenotypes are generalizable
across critical illness syndromes and associate with both short- and long-term outcomes. Determining whether
inflammatory phenotypes are identifiable across common critical illness syndromes can fundamentally alter our
approach to classifying critical illness in a way that captures a more uniform biological phenotype agnostic to
syndromic diagnosis. (2) a Clinical Center Study that addresses the critical need to better understand airspace
biology in patients with ARDS and other etiologies of acute respiratory failure (ARF). It has long been
recognized that airspace biology differs significantly from that of the circulation, but the field has lacked a non-
invasive, inexpensive, simple, and safe method of sampling the distal airspace in ARF. Our group has
pioneered a new method for sampling the airspace in intubated, mechanically ventilated patients with ARF
using fluid extracted from heat moisture exchanger (HME) filter. The HARMONY study (HME for Acute
Respiratory failure MultidimensiONal phenotYping) has a primary goal of identifying lung-specific phenotypes
in ARF that will be tested for associations with long term functional and structural respiratory outcomes. Our
Center will leverage our expertise in critical illness phenotyping, robust ED/ICU patient enrollment (37,756
patients in 5 years), pioneering work in long term outcomes in ICU survivors, decades of experience studying
biomarkers of critical illness and novel approaches to study airspace biology, to play a key role in the APS
Consortium and have a major and sustained impact in the field of ARDS, pneumonia, and sepsis."
10800772,"The therapeutics efficacy of an anticancer treatment is often restricted by tumor fibrous tissue and tumor
microenvironment. Stromal matrix barriers create a sanctuary for breast cancer, while the prolonged pro-fibrotic
stimuli facilitate cancer cell growth and survival by establishing an immunosuppressive environment. Relaxin, a
small peptide hormone, demonstrated dual anti-fibrotic and pro-immunogenic effects in various disease models
including several solid cancers. Treatment with relaxin significantly reduced the expression of major tumor
extracellular matrix components such as collagens, fibronectin, and elastin. The degradation of fibrotic tumor
matrix following relaxin treatment led to reduced cancer cell drug resistance. Additionally, it was shown that
relaxin can change tumor macrophage population from pro-inflammatory to pro-resolution enabling T cell-
mediated cancer cell killing and macrophage phagocytosis. However, due to a short half-life in vivo, delivery of
recombinant relaxin requires continuous infusion. Relaxin signals through its cognate G protein-coupled receptor
RXFP1, which is expressed in tumor associated fibroblasts and infiltrating immune cells. We propose targeting
the integrity of the tumor microenvironment with the first-in-class small molecule agonist of RXFP1 developed in
our laboratories. The lead compound, ML290, shows high activity, oral bioavailability, in vivo stability, and
excellent pharmacological properties. It is well tolerated by animals, shows no toxicity in vivo, and does not
increase cancer cell proliferation and invasiveness nor does it affect extracellular matrix remodeling in healthy
tissues. Our preliminary data indicate that the ML290 treatment of mice with HER2-positive breast cancer
reduces tumor size and tumor fibrotic content. The overall goal of this project is to demonstrate anticancer activity
of relaxin receptor agonist, ML290, in preclinical models of breast cancer, regardless of cancer subtype. We will
test the anti-cancer efficacy of ML290 in primary and metastatic breast cancer models, analyze changes in tumor
ECM composition, recruitment of immune cells, and genomic/proteomic response in stromal and cancer cells to
treatment. We will analyze the effect of combination treatment of ML290 with immune checkpoint blockade and
anti-HER2 immunotherapeutics. The pharmacological re-programing of stromal cancer microenvironment by
ML290 will provide a new therapeutic approach for breast cancer suppression."

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer in men in the United States. The absolute number
of men with PCa is projected to increase as a result of the ageing baby boomer population. However, the lack
of reliable biomarkers for PCa screening has led to decreased early detection, particularly for African American
(AA) men who have the highest PCa morbidity, metastatic risk and mortality rates than any other racial or
ethnic group in the US. When cancer is suspected, patients must undergo multiple needle core biopsies
because of the multifocal nature of PCa. Nonetheless, up to 34% of biopsied men are told they are cancer-free
when they are not, because the biopsies missed the cancer foci. Hence, it is critical to better define the
cellular and molecular features indicative of PCa development and risk for aggressive disease in benign
biopsies of PCa patients to improve diagnosis and screening. In this grant, we are proposing to explore a
variation on the concept of field effect in PCa, postulating that histopathologically benign looking prostate core
biopsies may in fact feature alterations indicative of PCa and of PCa aggressiveness present in the same
patient at another prostatic site, using age- and race-matched (AA and Caucasian Americans (CA)) sets of
samples (benign and cancer-bearing biopsies for each patient). Prostate-resident mast cells (MC) aggregate in
stromal, peritumoral and/or intratumoral areas but their clinical relevance remains controversial. Our preliminary
data suggests the usefulness of establishing MC profiles in benign prostatic tissues of PCa patients. The
objectives of this application are: to investigate MC functional profiles in benign human prostate tissues as
predictors of PCa aggressiveness and candidate functional biomarkers of PCa race disparity; to define and
validate a molecular signature indicative of PCa and PCa aggressiveness present in benign human prostate
biopsies and test its predictive value for PCa disparity and association to MC; and apply our new screening
modalities in clinics, contingent upon successful validation studies. We anticipate that our approach may
improve diagnosis and screening for high-risk PCa and position MC as potential drivers of PCa disparity."

The studies and career development activities described in this K08 application are designed to equip Dr. William
Damsky, the Principal Investigator, with experience and expertise in human translational and basic immunology
in order to become in independent investigator in these areas. The focus of the research proposal is sarcoidosis,
an idiopathic inflammatory disorder characterized by the formation of granulomas in affected tissues. Sarcoidosis
causes significant morbidity and mortality and disproportionally affects African Americans in the U.S. Treatments
for sarcoidosis are currently unsatisfactory. We have discovered that Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors can be used
to treat sarcoidosis in contexts where other medications have failed and are currently performing a clinical trial
to evaluate this further. Based on our preliminary studies, we hypothesize that JAK inhibitors work by blocking
the activity of specific JAK-dependent cytokines produced by pathogenic CD4+ T cells that in turn activate
macrophages. In this proposal, we describe how we will use cutaneous sarcoidosis biopsies and single cell RNA
sequencing to create a receptor-ligand based cell-cell interactome map to deconvolute signals driving granuloma
formation in sarcoidosis. Special attention will be given to JAK-dependent cytokines. Next, using a biorepository
of skin and blood samples from 10 patients with systemic sarcoidosis before and during treatment with a Janus
kinase inhibitor, we will use multiple approaches to determine the mechanism of action of JAK inhibition in this
disease and evaluate heterogeneity in immunologic characteristics at baseline and in response to a JAK inhibitor.
We will also use proteomic approaches to profile plasma cytokine levels in the 10 patients before and during
JAK inhibitor treatment to identify potential biomarkers of response and effects of treatment on inflammation at
a systemic level. Last, we will perform spatial transcriptomics on sarcoidosis tissues from multiple organs (lymph
nodes and lungs) to evaluate our hypothesis that core cytokine signals that drive granuloma formation in
sarcoidosis are largely conserved among different organs. In summary, the research portion of this proposal will
evaluate molecular mechanisms for a promising new treatment approach for a disease in which effective
approved therapies are currently lacking. The proposal will also support a period of career development during
which I will receive additional training in basic and translational immunology in the laboratory of Dr. Richard
Flavell in the Department of Immunobiology at Yale School of Medicine. This highly collaborative and supportive
research environment combined with directed additional career development activities focused on computational
approaches, quantitative pathology, spatial transcriptomics, and academic leadership will allow me to
successfully achieve research independence as a physician scientist and open my own laboratory so that I can
use basic and translational immunologic approaches to study inflammatory disorders including sarcoidosis."
10877191,"The goal of this application is to understand how the t(8;21), the most frequent chromosomal
translocation associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), sets the stage for secondary
mutations to accumulate and develop into AML. Understanding how the encoded AML1-ETO
fusion protein alters epigenetic wiring, is critical to finding less debilitating therapies that yield
better outcomes. Both AML1 (RUNX1) and ETO/MTG family members also suffer point mutations
in solid tumors, and the ETO family members Mtgr1 (CBFA2T2) and Mtg16 (CBFA2T3) are tumor
suppressors in mouse models of intestinal neoplasia, so understanding how ETO contacts histone
modifying enzymes has great impact outside of the t(8;21). In our preliminary data, we have used
CRISPR/Cas9 technology to modify the 3’ end of the endogenous AML1-ETO with FKBP12F36V-
HA or 3XFLAG tags to selectively and rapidly degrade AML1-ETO. We have coupled this system
with state-of-the-art genomics such as precision nuclear run-on transcription sequencing (PROseq)
and Cut&Run to establish a chemical genetic system to unambiguously define the mechanism of
transcriptional control by AML1-ETO. Critically, this allows us to define the earliest, and presumably
direct, changes in transcription upon inactivation of the fusion protein. Our preliminary PROseq data
demonstrate that enhancers within key hematopoietic regulatory genes such as CEBPA are
reactivated within 2 hr of adding dTAG47 to Kasumi-1 cell cultures. These novel reagents allow us
to define changes in histone modifications and RNA polymerase dynamics to define the action of
AML1-ETO at defined loci and throughout the genome. Moreover, our preliminary data already
provide a paradigm shift: even though AML1-ETO bound enhancers have been repressed since
the establishment of these cell lines, they were reactivated with a time course that matched the
degradation of the fusion protein. Thus, continued expression of AML1-ETO is needed to maintain
repression, at many loci, while other loci are more permanently silenced. Finally, we used CRISPR
to allow rapid purification of AML1-ETO coupled with MUDPIT and identified a new chromatin
modifying complex as potentially mediating AML1-ETO-dependent repression. We hypothesize that
AML1-ETO recruits histone modifying enzymes to rewire the epigenetic landscape to suppress
CEBPA, PU.1 and GFI1B to impair myeloid differentiation. This sets the stage for secondary
epigenetic mutations that reinforce these changes such as inactivation of ASXL1/2. We will directly
test this hypothesis by defining the molecular contacts that control AML1-ETO recruitment of
repression complexes and use chemical genetics to test if these contacts are required for AML1-

and other psychotic disorders. It particularly emphasizes training in cognitive and affective deficits in psychotic
disorders, influences on clinical and functional outcomes, and intervention research to improve clinical and
functional outcomes. Training will include core didactic coursework and direct experiences in designing and
conducting clinical research with patients with psychotic illnesses, including randomized clinical trials to
evaluate efficacy of interventions and research into mechanisms of action of interventions. Direct mentoring by
clinical investigators and other scientists and statisticians is a key feature of this program, with the focus being
on development and implementation of clinical research with individuals with schizophrenia, severe mood
disorders, and other psychotic disorders and those at risk for such disorders.
This postdoctoral training program will focus on individuals with Ph.D. in clinical psychology and those with an
M.D. followed by a psychiatry residency. In addition, individuals with a Ph.D. in cognitive or affective
neuroscience and similar fields who focus on research on psychotic disorders will be welcomed. The training
program includes (1) extensive hands-on training in the development and implementation of clinical research
on cognitive and affective factors in outcomes and on interventions to improve clinical and functional
outcomes, (2) a weekly Research Seminar on the Psychoses taught jointly by clinical researchers and other
scientists focused on research methods, recent research results, and grant preparation issues, (3) a set of core
courses in research design, statistics, and implementation of clinical trials and other clinical research, (4) other
coursework, workshops, and laboratory training tailored to individual research interests, (5) an intensive career
development retreat and other career development sessions, and (6) training to enhance the responsible
conduct and reproducibility of research. The training will be closely interfaced with many clinical research
opportunities that allow access to research participants with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders."
10875501,"ABSTRACT: There are significant differences between men and women in the incidence and severity of late-
onset Alzheimer’s Disease (LOAD). After menopause, women are more likely to develop LOAD, and symptoms
of the disease including cognitive impairment are more severe. These symptoms are exacerbated by high
cholesterol which, at midlife, is a major risk factor for LOAD. There is a substantial gap in our knowledge of how
estrogen and cholesterol interact. We propose to examine the role of estrogen and cholesterol in LOAD sex
differences by studying male and female cholesterol-fed rabbits – an unconventional but promising model of
LOAD. These rabbits show significant sex differences in AD-like pathology, estrogen receptor transcriptional
activity and protein expression, and differences in cognition. Cholesterol-fed female rabbits develop beta
amyloid (Aβ) deposits more slowly than cholesterol-fed males and eliminating peripheral estrogen by
ovariectomy more than doubles Aβ levels, suggesting a protective role for estrogen. We have evidence that a
cholesterol diet alters estrogen receptors, significantly increases serum and hippocampal levels of the
cholesterol metabolite, 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC), and female cholesterol-fed rabbits remember
hippocampally-dependent learning better than cholesterol-fed males. 27-OHC is a well-documented
endogenous selective estrogen receptor modulator that may play a role in learning and memory because patients
with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD show elevated 27-OHC levels and we have evidence that
cholesterol-fed rabbits have elevated 27-OHC and memory deficits. We also have data showing there are sex
differences in the transcriptional activity of estrogen receptors and expression of proteins in the presynaptic
active zone and postsynaptic density that are higher in female cholesterol-fed rabbits than in males. Our
research focus on cholesterol-induced increases in 27-OHC has direct clinical relevance because midlife
hypercholesterolemia is a significant risk factor for LOAD and, as noted, 27-OHC is elevated in MCI and LOAD.
In three specific aims, we will manipulate estrogen (Aim 1), 27-OHC (Aim 2), and estrogen receptors (Aim 3) in
cholesterol-fed rabbits to test the hypothesis that sex differences in AD-like cognitive impairment and pathology
are a function of estrogen and can be rescued with estrogen receptor modulation. Using behavioral,
electrophysiological, histochemical, and molecular biological techniques, we will determine the mechanisms by
which estrogen receptor modulation affects memory, neural function, markers of cholesterol and Aβ processing,
and Aβ and tau levels in intact and castrated male and in intact and ovariectomized female cholesterol-fed
rabbits. Our expertise in and track record of behavioral, histochemical, electrophysiological, and molecular
biological research in cholesterol-fed rabbits makes us a particularly well-suited team to conduct these
experiments, further validate this non-transgenic model of LOAD, and positions us to help understand the impact
of sex differences on the molecular determinants of LOAD risk and responsiveness to treatment."

The problem: Dental caries is the leading health condition worldwide, affecting billions of people and causing
pain, impaired nutrition and social functioning, reduction in work/school productivity, and significant economic
impacts. For the most vulnerable groups, such as children and older adults, and individuals with high caries
risk of all ages, the consequences of this disease – including a reduced quality of life, morbidity and even
mortality – are unacceptable. Because caries is caused by the metabolism of dietary sugars by a cariogenic
biofilm, it is very difficult to control; the widespread consumption of fermentable sugars in modern diets favors
cariogenic species such as Streptococcus mutans and the opportunistic fungi Candida albicans in the dental
biofilm, perpetuating the caries process. Fluoride is the most effective agent for caries control, but it has very
limited antimicrobial effects because most microbes have membrane proteins to expel fluoride and keep
intracellular concentrations at sub-inhibitory levels. Different oral microbial species possess different types of
fluoride exporters; S. mutans and C. albicans employ CLCF and FEX proteins, respectively, while beneficial
oral streptococci use Fluc proteins. This creates an opportunity to specifically target pathogenic oral microbes
to modify species dynamics towards health-associated symbiotic communities in biofilms exposed to sugar and
fluoride. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that fluoride export proteins can be targeted for antimicrobial
development against cariogenic oral bacteria and fungi, while leaving beneficial oral microbiota intact. This
hypothesis will be tested in the following specific aims: S.A.#1: To evaluate the competitive fitness of fluoride
export-deficient strains of S. mutans and C. albicans in mixed-species biofilms under conditions of changing
fluoride and pH; S.A.#2: To identify natural products that potentiate fluoride toxicity for pathogenic oral
microbiota. Significance: The results of these studies will establish groundwork for the development of novel
caries treatments that potentiate the antimicrobial effects of fluoride ion, as well as provide new basic
knowledge about the role of fluoride and microbial fluoride resistance mechanisms in community dynamics of
the oral microbiota."

Research shows that teaching primary literature in the classroom can increase students’ inquiry and critical
thinking skills and promote a deeper understanding of scientific concepts and the nature of science [1-3]. When
research is presented by scientists, students report feeling that the research being studied is more authentic and
relevant [4]. Exposure to scientists from diverse backgrounds can also work to dispel misconceptions about who
scientists are and who can be a scientist [5]. This is especially important for female and Black, Indigenous,
People of Color (BIPOC) students [5]. Yet, many BIOPOC youth in Memphis, TN lack access and opportunity
to engage with scientists and high-quality STEM education due to systemic practices of racial segregation and
inequitable distribution of resources [6,7] and many scientists lack the skills necessary to effectively
communicate science to high school students. To address these gaps, we propose the Memphis STEM-M
Ecosystem Scientists Communicate Research to Students (MemSCoReS) Program, a new program that couples
science communication professional development with high school outreach in the form of a virtual science
journal club. This will include development, implementation, and evaluation of 1) the MemSTEMMbassadors
Program, a professional development opportunity to enhance scientists’ science communication skills, 2) the
Virtual Science Journal Club, a scientist/classroom partnership to expose high school students to scientists and
primary literature, and 3) the Primary Scientific Literature in the Science Classroom Teacher’s Guide, a guide to
provide teachers with structures to help integrate primary literature into their science classroom."
10876981,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposed renewal of Boston University's Training Program in Advanced Research Training
in Communication Disorders and Sciences builds on the successful implementation of a multi-
disciplinary, multi-institutional training effort. The current five-year cycle infuses a broad clinical
perspective in trainees, incorporating didactic and research experiences across the full
continuum of effective training in human health (i.e., from investigations of basic and disrupted
mechanisms or communication processes, to treatment research, translation to the clinic, and
broad implementation across health systems). Participating pre- and postdoctoral trainees have
come from programs in Biomedical Engineering, Neuroscience, Psychological & Brain Sciences,
and Speech, Language, & Hearing Sciences. The program is highly competitive at both the pre-
and postdoctoral levels. The impact of this T32 is doubled at the predoctoral level by the
commitment of each participating department to provide identical resources and opportunities
for a “match” Communication Sciences & Disorders trainee for each T32-supported trainee.
The next five-year cycle continues all of these successful components, and adds formal
development for each trainee of a data sciences toolkit. New Key Personnel from Boston
University's recently established Faculty of Computing and Data Sciences (see Biosketches for
Azer Bestavros, Associate Provost for Computing and Data Sciences, and Director of the BU
Data Science Initiative, as well as Eric Kolaczyk, Director of the Hariri Institute for Computing
and Computational Science & Engineering) will provide curricular and research guidance for this
aspect of the program. Required training in data sciences includes demonstrated facility by each
trainee in math, statistics, data wrangling, data mechanics, and machine learning. Coursework
may include data manipulation using Python, data science using R, and image analysis.
The success of our trainees reflects the deep research and training resources of the inter-
disciplinary and cross-institution partnerships comprising this program. Well-established
laboratories guided by experienced and well-funded preceptors, with access to large, diverse
patient populations are supported by experienced leaders and institutional commitment. This
preparation and acculturation of talented trainees contributes substantially to our scientific and
clinical capacity to understand, prevent, and remediate communication disorders."
10909200,"In this Adventures in Drug Discovery (ADD) project, the Institute for Future Intelligence
(IFI) and the University of Florida (UF) will collaborate with diverse high schools in
Florida, Hawaii, Maryland, Ohio, Rhode Island, and South Carolina to develop novel
educational technologies and curriculum materials to help teachers and students teach
and learn data science as a method for accelerating drug discovery. The key innovation
will be Artificial Intelligence for Molecular Science (AIMS), an integrated learning platform
based on using visual and interactive technologies to open the “opaque box” of the
science, data, and computation needed to find or design new drugs. Powered by AIMS,
the curriculum materials will provide practical means to integrate data science into
chemistry and biology courses. The materials will be aligned with related education
standards such as the Next Generation Science Standards. The project will integrate
culturally responsive teaching and inquiry‐based learning to promote equity and
diversity. Participating teachers will be supported by ongoing professional development
workshops and learning communities. The products of the project will be disseminated
through a citizen science program that uses a gamified version of AIMS to engage the
general public to explore drug discovery. After the project ends, IFI will maintain the
products to ensure that they continue to serve teachers, students, and the public.
The scope of this project falls within the mission of NIH's National Center for Advancing
Translational Sciences (NCATS) related to “incorporating artificial intelligence and
machine learning into the drug development process.” The Specific Aims are: 1) To
develop the AIMS technologies and materials using a design‐based research framework
that involves iterative design cycles informed by student and teacher feedback based on
classroom tests; 2) To leverage the complementarity between culturally responsive
teaching and inquiry‐based learning to develop content that accommodates the unique
interests, values, and funds of knowledge of diverse students; and 3) To create a citizen
science program for drug discovery based on gamifying complex computational
procedures such as molecular docking and drug screening. To supplement IFI and UF's
expertise, the project will also involve researchers and educators in molecular science,
data science, and serious games for citizen science from Harvard Medical School, South
Dakota State University, and Northeastern University as consultants."
10894632,"Project Summary/Abstract
Genomic medicine is the discipline of interpreting genomic information about an individual as part of their
clinical care, for diagnosis, prognosis, or therapeutic decision-making. Integral to the practice of genome
interpretation is the collection of multiple lines of evidence from knowledgebases to support or refute the
clinical significance of evaluated variants. Modern clinical variant knowledgebases maintain literature and
variant coverage that is mostly non-overlapping. This diversity of content causes a known problem in genome
interpretation: analysts tasked with assembling a clinical variant report choose to spend considerable time
navigating multiple resources and collating evidence, or risk missing critical information by selectively
evaluating fewer resources. The resulting effort needed for an analyst to clinically interpret a variant list is
known as the interpretation bottleneck, for its rate-limiting role in the clinical evaluation of patient genomes.
Data integrators from public and private genomic medicine organizations work to alleviate this bottleneck by
developing integrative clinical interpretation applications for use by genome analysts. As new knowledgebases
are created, each of these public and private data integrators is left with the task of designing and maintaining
another interface for each new resource, leading to combinatorial growth of data harmonization effort across
the entire system. This approach is not scalable.
This project will enable a transition to a scalable, interoperable, and federated genomic data ecosystem from
the data integrators and knowledgebases already in existence today. To build an interoperable network of
knowledgebases will require development and validation of a computable knowledge framework for genomic
medicine. The framework will require the drafting of modern genomic knowledge standards, and development
of the tools and services needed to support the implementation of those standards. These objectives will be
carried out through coordination of several research activities with the Variant Interpretation for Cancer
Consortium, ClinGen, and the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health. Research will involve
conceptualization of genomic knowledge as precise computable concepts, designing schema for those
concepts, developing framework support tools, and building intuitive user applications to leverage these
advances.
As a result of this research, new knowledgebases implementing this framework become immediately
accessible to existing applications, while new applications and workflows implementing this framework are
immediately able to leverage a wide breadth of data sources. In addition to these immediate benefits, the
creation of a standardized, federated knowledge network reduces barriers for developing new products,
spurring innovation towards novel applications for research, education, and clinical decision support tools."
10887412,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Fuchs’ endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is an age-related degenerative disorder resulting in corneal edema
and loss of vision. FECD occurs in 4% of whites over the age of 40 years and is the leading indication for corneal
transplantation in the U.S. Over 70% of cases are caused by a CTG triplet repeat expansion in the TCF4 gene.
Expanded CUG repeat RNA (CUGexp) transcripts expressed from this gene locus accumulate as nuclear foci in
the corneal endothelium of patients. The CUGexp foci bind and functionally sequester the splicing factors MBNL1
and MBNL2 to trigger mis-splicing in FECD endothelial tissue. To examine the endothelial cell-type specificity
for FECD, we will determine if somatic mutations in the post-mitotic corneal endothelium of FECD patients results
in a larger triplet repeat expansion than in their blood. We will examine if other anterior segment cell-types
including corneal epithelium, stromal keratocytes, and trabecular meshwork cells are prone to accumulation of
CUGexp foci and associated molecular defects. To test the MBNL sequestration hypothesis, we will examine if
the knockdown of MBNLs in healthy donor endothelial tissue is sufficient to recapitulate the mis-splicing and
upregulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) genes found early in the disease course. In early and late FECD, we
observed a marked overexpression of the cochlin gene that produces a secreted ECM protein also capable of
recruiting immune cells. The cochlin protein was previously detected in the trabecular meshwork of patients with
primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), and our preliminary data indicate that the protein is present in the
aqueous humor and trabecular meshwork of FECD subjects. We will examine levels of the cochlin protein in
corneal tissue, aqueous humor samples, and trabecular meshwork tissue of FECD patients for its possible
contribution to corneal disease findings and the increased risk for glaucoma in these patients. Additionally, we
will examine the prevalence of POAG in our large UTSW FECD cohort and determine if there is a correlation
with the triplet repeat length. We will use single-cell RNA sequencing combined with IHC to identify the immune
cells and their contribution to late-stage FECD. We have characterized the efficacy of 45 antisense
oligonucleotides (ASOs) and duplex RNAs that block disease-causing CUGexp foci. Using patient-derived cells
and tissue, we will examine their potency based on their ability to block foci formation and their specificity based
on transcriptome-wide assessment of on- and off-target events. We will examine delivery, length of action, and
safety using wild-type mice. To enable studies of disease biology and in vivo drug testing, we have generated
what we believe is the first mouse model with a knock-in of expanded CTG repeats. In preliminary studies, we
show that our knock-in strategy successfully recapitulates CUGexp foci formation in corneal endothelium. We will
further characterize this murine model by aging these mice to examine for the transcriptional and histologic
alterations of FECD disease, and then use these mice to test our lead CUG-repeat targeting oligonucleotides for
therapeutic development."
10912825,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 Pediatric cardiac arrest is common, with resultant high morbidity and mortality. Neurologic disability
occurs in up to 80% of children who survive a cardiac arrest. Brain injury after cardiac arrest is caused by the
initial hypoxic-ischemic event and from secondary brain injury that occurs in the following hours to days. The
focus of post-cardiac arrest care is to reduce secondary brain injury. Cerebral autoregulation (CAR) is a
physiologic process by which cerebral blood vessels dilate or constrict to maintain relatively constant cerebral
blood flow (CBF) across a range of mean arterial blood pressures (MAPs). Impaired CAR makes the brain
vulnerable to states of hypoperfusion and hyperperfusion which can contribute to secondary brain injury and
preventable neurologic disability. There is a knowledge gap regarding the MAP at which CAR is most intact
after pediatric cardiac arrest, and the impact of the deviation from this optimal MAP on brain injury and clinical
outcomes. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that patients with larger differences between their MAP
and optimal MAP after cardiac arrest will have worse microstructural brain injury and clinical outcomes.
 For this proposal, CBF will be measured directly using an advanced, non-invasive optical imaging
technique called diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS), which will be used to calculate optimal MAP. Brain
injury will be quantified using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The primary clinical outcome is
neurologic disability at hospital discharge based on the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category. The
objectives of the proposed research are to determine whether patients with larger deviations from their DCS-
determined optimal MAP have worse clinical outcomes (Aim 1) and microstructural brain injury on diffusion
MRI (Aim 2) compared to patients with smaller deviations from their optimal MAP. In addition, regional CBF
derived from DCS will be correlated with CBF derived from arterial spin labeled (ASL) MRI (Aim 3).
 The successful completion of these studies will further our understanding of the mechanisms underlying
post-cardiac arrest brain injury and inform future trials of cerebral physiology-targeted management strategies
to improve pediatric cardiac arrest outcomes. The applicant, Dr. Matthew Kirschen, a pediatric intensivist and
neurologist at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and University of Pennsylvania, will engage in a rigorous
training program of didactic courses and mentoring by experts in pediatric cardiac arrest, cerebral physiology
and autoregulation, and brain imaging. He will gain expertise in clinical biostatistics through the Master of
Science in Clinical Epidemiology program, advanced optical imaging, and diffusion MRI analytics. Through the
proposed studies, his parallel career development plan, a team of dedicated and experienced mentors, and a
world-class environment, Dr. Kirschen will achieve his goal of becoming an independent neurocritical care
research scientist with special focus on neurologic resuscitation following pediatric cardiac arrest."
10894802,"Pregnant women living with HIV (PWLHIV) are more likely to experience adverse birth outcomes, including
preterm birth (PTB), than pregnant women not living with HIV (PWNLHIV), thereby substantially contributing to
maternal and infant morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Alterations in bacteria of the vagina
vaginal have been linked to PTB but this cannot fully explain the increased risk. We found that although PWLHIV
had an increased vaginal bacterial diversity and higher prevalence of bacterial vaginosis (BV)-associated
bacteria compared to PWNLHIV, HIV infection was independently associated with PTB. Therefore, other
mechanisms must be in play. The role of vaginal viral communities, collectively referred to as “virome”, has not
been evaluated. Additionally, the mechanisms of HIV- versus ARV-induced PTB needs to be investigated so that
intervention measures can be identified to mitigate these risks.
The enteric virome appears to be altered during HIV infection. Expansion of bacteriophages, viruses that infect
bacteria, has been linked to immune cell expansion and increased inflammation in the gut and gut bacterial
diversity is mirrored in the virome. In non-pregnant WLHIV, viruses from four major viral families were found in
the upper female genital tract, but no comparison to PWNLHIV was made and the presence of bacteriophages
was not evaluated. A higher prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV), especially of high-risk types, has been
found in WLHIV compared to WNLHIV. However, to date, limited data exist on the effect of HIV on the collective
vaginal viral community, which is likely to be altered. Likewise, few studies have investigated the relationship
between the vaginal virome and PTB. Here we hypothesise that HIV infection leads to an expanded vaginal
virome, including increased number and diversity of bacteriophages, which either directly or indirectly (through
alteration of the bacterial microbiota) is associated with a higher PTB risk in PWLHIV. As part of this proposed
project, we will leverage the infrastructure and samples, as well as rigorous and extensive data of two ongoing
cohorts of pregnant women in Cape Town, South Africa to address this hypothesis with the following Specific
Aims:
Aim 1: To assess the effect of HIV, pregnancy and antiretroviral drugs on vaginal virome diversity and
composition. Hypothesis 1: PWLHIV have an expanded vaginal virome compared to PWNLHIV
Aim 2: To evaluate vaginal bacteriophage-host interactions in PWLHIV. Hypothesis 2: Viral communities
alter the bacterial component of the vagina through predator-prey dynamics
Aim 3: To compare vaginal virome diversity and composition in women experiencing PTB versus age-
and parity-matched women with normal birth outcomes. Hypothesis 3: Expansion of the vaginal virome is
responsible for increased rates of PTB."
10842303,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - REGULATORY CORE
The objectives of this Core are to develop appropriate project-specific regulatory strategies, define project
milestones relative to the critical regulatory issues, and support execution of those strategies to meet the requisite
milestones. Genome editing technologies have several unique regulatory challenges within a rapidly changing
regulatory landscape. While the FDA provides resources to guide preclinical development, these materials
generally require a degree of applicable experience for effective and appropriate interpretation and use. The
Core staff’s substantial development experience, spanning discovery through clinical evaluation of advanced
therapeutics like cell and gene therapies, is integral to project success. The Core will leverage the Forward BIO
Institute’s Catapult Program, which employs a milestone-driven approach to support regulatory-informed
decisions and improve the pace and quality of preclinical development. Catapult focuses on navigating the
regulatory landscape during preclinical development and provides a workflow with an actionable toolkit to identify
and develop measures to address risk. The Core’s Tasks are: 1) identify critical regulatory-related deficiencies,
2) develop a comprehensive project-specific technology maturation pipeline in collaboration with the other Cores
and individual Project teams, 3) monitor progress related to regulatory milestones, and 4) develop documentation
needed to advance a therapy towards IND submission. Successful completion of these Tasks will bridge critical
knowledge gaps, mitigate risk, address regulatory concerns, and facilitate effective communication with the FDA.
Outcomes include a regulatory plan that delineates specific actions, identification of applicable FDA Expedited
Programs, and generation of documents including the INTERACT and pre-IND briefing packages and the IND
submission. The Regulatory Core will capitalize on the CRISPR Vision Program’s unique opportunity to advance
clinical translation of these modular editing and delivery systems by standardizing preclinical testing approaches,
including use of human pluripotent stem cell-based models, and by recognizing the opportunities afforded to
academic translational science by the recent FDA guidance on gene therapy for rare disease. This is possible
due to the high degree of regulatory synergy that exists between the Projects and Cores, in particular safety
aspects such as toxicology, immune response, and on/off-target effects. Numerous elements of one Project
directly inform development of the other, and sequential FDA engagement enables Projects 2 and 3 to build on
the regulatory foundation established from the feedback FDA provides to Project 1. The synergy with the Human
Cell Assay and Large Animal Cores is even more pronounced, as no suitable animal model exists to evaluate
safety for these and other somatic cell genome editors. Furthermore, a modular regulatory approach leverages
the regulatory commonalities and clarifies the unique considerations, serving to expedite the path to clinical
assessment of nonviral genomic editing technologies for rare diseases and the field as a whole."
10842306,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - LEAD TRAILBLAZER PROJECT 1
Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) is a rare but severe form of pediatric blindness. One subtype, LCA16, is
caused by several single-point mutations in the KCNJ13 gene, which encodes the inwardly-rectifying potassium
channel Kir7.1 in the retina. There is no FDA-approved treatment for ultra-rare conditions such as LCA16. The
objective of Lead Project 1 is to develop a new LCA16 gene therapy utilizing a CRISPR base editor (BE)
delivered to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) via a nonviral silica nanocapsule (SNC). The SNCs possess
many desirable properties, including high delivery efficiency, versatile surface chemistry for ligand conjugation,
small particle sizes, good biocompatibility, and scalable production. In preliminary studies, we show that the SNC
can transiently deliver a wide range of biologics, including a BE to RPE cells in mice and LCA16 patient-derived
induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-RPE. Within five years, we seek to optimize and validate a lead candidate,
SNC-101, progress to scaled-up and CGMP production of the product to enable non-human primate (NHP)
studies and file an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA for base editing therapy of LCA16. In
Aim 1, we will generate a preclinical validation package with a lead SNC formulation for W53* KCNJ13 correction.
We will first optimize the amount of ATRA targeting ligand (RPE cell-specific) and the modified KCNJ13 sgRNA
in vitro via the Human Cell Assays Core and in vivo in a W53* LCA16 mouse model. We will then develop a
scale-up production process for the optimized SNC (i.e., SNC101) for preclinical studies. We plan to complete
one INTERACT meeting at the end of this aim. In Aim 2, we will determine the gene correction efficiency, dosing,
and toxicity in mouse models and NHPs. We will comprehensively evaluate the immune, structural, and
functional consequences of subretinal delivery of SNC-101 through our W53* LCA16 mouse model. Using our
Large Animal Core, we will also perform dose-escalation safety studies in NHPs. Alongside the species
comparison, the study will ascertain storage stability, dosing, and toxicity profiles in detail, an important milestone
to support an IND with the FDA. In Aim 3, we will conduct IND enabling studies of SNC-101 for W53* KCNJ13
correction. A pre-IND meeting package will be submitted to FDA CBER with the help of our Regulatory Core.
Waisman Biomanufacturing will develop a full-scale engineering run to be used in GLP toxicology study in rats
and NHPs. Concurrent with the toxicology study, one entire CGMP batch will be manufactured. We will submit
an IND application to the FDA in the final year. To date, no nonviral genome editing therapeutic has reached an
IND in the eye. Success here with SNC-101 would pave the way for this new therapeutic modality. Finally, the
knowledge gained along this development path will accelerate the translation of other nonviral genome editing
leads, including SNC-201 and TAGE-101, in the Follower Projects of the CRISPR Vision Program."

Best Disease (BD) is a prevalent, primarily autosomal dominant, macular degenerative disorder that results in
retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) dysfunction and progressive loss of central vision. BD results from >200 known
missense mutations in the BEST1 gene. Whereas there are currently no viable treatment options for autosomal
dominant BD, genome editing could offer a promising therapeutic strategy. The goal of this Follower Project
2 is to develop a safe and effective genome editing treatment for BD using Spotlight Therapeutics’
proprietary Targeted Active Gene Editors (TAGE) platform. TAGE is a novel, nonviral, non-nanoparticle
delivery system wherein a functional CRISPR-Cas effector is fused to antibody (Ab) and cell-penetrating
peptide (CPP) moieties, enabling in vivo cell-targeted delivery, intracellular trafficking to the nucleus and
subsequent gene editing. A TAGE-101 lead will be developed through identification and optimization of these
modular components and complexation with a human single guide RNA (sgRNA) that binds mutant Best1. A
preclinical data package will be generated demonstrating >10% editing/knockout of the R218C mutant BEST1
allele, restored function, and acceptable off-target and genotoxicity profiles ex vivo, using patient iPSC-derived
RPEs, and in non-GLP nonhuman primate (NHP) toxicity studies. INTERACT and pre-IND meetings with the
FDA are planned to present a preclinical and upstream process development data package and a future
development plan and to explore whether additional BD mutants can be addressed with patient-specific guides
under a master IND for TAGE-101. At the end of the five-year grant horizon, the TAGE-101 development
candidate will be poised to initiate IND-enabling studies and, ultimately, clinically tested in BEST1 patients. This
Project and Project 3 aim to develop CRISPR-Cas-based gene editing therapies targeting a BEST1 mutant allele
employing different delivery platforms. Synergy will exist in areas such as sgRNA development, ex vivo
preclinical characterization studies in partnership with the Human Cell Assay Core, as well as a regulatory
strategy for BD in partnership with the Regulatory Core. This project will also have synergy with Project 1 around
pilot NHP studies, addressing RPE channelopathies via subretinal injection, in partnership with the Large Animal
Core. Successful completion of this project will provide a rigorous, stepwise approach to nominate a development
candidate poised to initiate IND-enabling studies for all individuals with BD resulting from a specific mutation. It
will also advance the utility of iPSC models as custom preclinical tools to rapidly develop somatic cell genome
editing strategies in conjunction with a novel cell-targeted CRISPR gene editing platform."
10763881,"ABSTRACT
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the second most common bacterial infections in humankind. Women account
for most infections with over 10% of infected subjects experiencing recurrent (rec)UTIs. Because of the high
recurrence rates of UTIs many UTI vaccines are being tested and some are now in clinical trials. However, after
almost three decades of effort, no effective UTI vaccine has yet emerged. Recently, we found that while
antibodies raised against bacterial vaccine antigens are partially effective in clearing bladder bacteria, it is
necessary to recruit pathogen-specific Th1 immune cells into the bladder before bacteria are eradicated. We
found that we could recruit robust numbers of pathogen-clearing CD4 T cells into mouse bladders by
transurethral instillation of a uropathogenic vaccine antigen (FimH) along with a Th1 polarizing adjuvant, CpG
oligodeoxynucleotides. This vaccination strategy was highly protective because in addition to evoking FimH
specific antibodies systemically, they were effective in recruiting pathogen eradicating Th1 cells into the bladder,
potentially preventing future recurrence. Importantly, this vaccine was efficacious in naïve mice but also, in mice
that have already experienced multiple UTIs, representing the population of patients most likely to receive a UTI
vaccine. Before we advance to clinical studies, we seek to undertake additional mouse studies to optimize the
bladder vaccine delivery and to identify appropriate surrogates of protection and vaccine efficacy obtained from
sampling urine and blood that can be deployed even in a limited phase 1 clinical trial. Therefore, the following
specific aims are proposed: (i), examine if bladder vaccination employing vaccine antigen containing
nanoparticles is effective in evoking local protective immunity against UPEC infections in both naïve and thrice
infected mice and (ii), identify surrogates and correlates of protection in mice that can potentially be used to
evaluate bladder vaccination efficacy."

Abstract
This technology research and development component focuses on the development of downfield 1H magnetic
resonance spectroscopic (DFS) technologies to measure several important metabolites (NAD+, Glutamine, PCr,
Carnosine and ATP) that are not accessible from the conventional upfield spectroscopy (UFS), and serve as
biomarkers for different diseases. Specifically, it develops novel technologies including (i) Spectral selective
excitation pulses and spatially localized pulse sequences with optimal excitation profiles and capable of ultra-
short echo acquisition without water suppression (ii) Strategies to detect and assign the DFS metabolites and
measure cross-relaxation (iii) Optimal metabolic cycling schemes capable of providing simultaneous UFS and
DFS with short echo acquisition and (iv) a post-processing pipeline integrating receive coil selection, eddy current
correction and spectral curve fitting and metabolite quantitation. These technological developments are driven
by collaborations and service projects from within PENN and from other institutions distributed across the US
and abroad. Successful completion of the goals will lead to technologies that contribute to our improved
understanding of aging, neurodegeneration, mitochondrial disease in skeletal muscle and heart and, thereby
improving diagnosis of these disorders and guiding the development of targeted therapies and enabling
longitudinal evaluation of the efficacy of these therapies. Furthermore, wide dissemination of these technologies,
potential commercialization, and training of the next generation of biomedical scientists, will have sustained
national impact."
10870144,"TR&D4: Emerging Diffuse Optical Technologies for Precision Medicine
Project PI: Arjun Yodh, PhD
Abstract
This proposal aims to develop and utilize diffuse optical technologies for precision medicine. Diffuse optics is a
field of biomedical optics that uses near-infrared (NIR) light to non-invasively probe living tissues located
millimeters to centimeters below tissue surfaces (deep tissues). NIR light is strongly scattered in tissue but is
weakly absorbed; thus, it can penetrate long distances in tissue. Under these conditions, light transport is well
approximated as a diffusive process. Using this diffusion model, it is possible to quantitatively separate tissue
scattering from tissue absorption and thus to carry out optical spectroscopy of deep tissues. Analysis of these
optical spectra, in turn, permits determination of the concentration of tissue chromophores. Use of the diffusion
equation also enables tomographic image reconstruction of tissue optical and physiological properties. The
proposed work uses two types of Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy (DOS), frequency-domain (FD-DOS) and
broadband (bDOS) diffuse optical spectroscopy, to measure tissue absorption and scattering, which in turn
permits quantitative determination of the tissue concentrations of important physiological parameters such as
oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin, lipid and water, and both oxidized and reduced forms of cytochrome-c-oxidase. The
proposed work also utilizes a qualitatively different optical technique called Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy
(DCS), which probes temporal fluctuations of light scattered in tissue that are sensitive to blood flow. The
combination of oxygen saturation and blood flow information from FD-DOS/DCS can be used to derive
quantitative information about tissue oxygen metabolism (CMRO2) based on hemodynamics. The combination
of bDOS/FD-DOS and bDOS-alone can be used to derive metrics of mitochondrial (cellular) metabolism. These
complementary metrics of tissue metabolism provide a new window into tissue health.
The proposed projects will provide unique benefits in clinical research applications. The technology is portable,
compatible with a wide range of measurement environments, and offers unique diagnostic capabilities for
dynamic physiological monitoring. These capabilities, and the comparatively low cost of optical devices,
complement the MRI methods under development in the center. Each aim of TRD4 addresses technological
needs with potential to facilitate individualized treatment for patients, i.e., precision medicine. Aim 1 focuses on
real-time bedside measurements of cerebral blood flow in regions of the brain covered by hair; it has immediate
applications in intensive care studies of brain-injured patients and for real time monitoring of neuromodulation
therapies. Aim 2 develops broadband spectroscopic instrumentation and combines it with FD-DOS to measure
cytochrome-c-oxidase (CCO) concentration in both its oxidized and reduced forms; CCO is a molecular
biomarker for mitochondrial function. Concurrent CCO and hemodynamics measurements should elucidate
mechanisms of tissue injury, e.g., oxygen delivery versus mitochondrial malfunction, and could provide early
warnings about brain health following CPR. Aim 3 develops, adapts, and applies traditional and emerging data
science analysis strategies to enhance the value of diffuse optics tools (from Aims 1,2) for brain injury diagnosis
and management; the tools will also have value for diagnosis of cancer in our Service Projects. Each application
holds promise for individualizing patient care (precision medicine)."

Clinical Trial Not Allowed) through the RFA-HL-19-024 mechanism. CURS will be modeled after Columbia
University's highly successful NINDS funded SPURS Program which has provided an intense undergraduate
research experience focusing on neuroscience on the campus of Columbia's College of Physicians &
Surgeons (P&S) for talented students from backgrounds that are under-represented in biomedical research
for the past 17 years. CURS will use this highly successful model and to train underrepresented students in
cardiovascular sciences. In the past SPURS participants have been accepted primarily from the City
University of New York (CUNY) senior colleges, including Hunter, Brooklyn, Queens, and City Colleges,
though in recent years we have extended our outreach and have accepted applications nationwide. Examples
of recent institutions SPURS has drawn underrepresented students from include Columbia University,
Barnard College, New York University, Harvard University, University of California, Berkeley, and Amherst
College. CURS will provide extensive training in basic science research, and enhance the likelihood that the
students will achieve a career in science by pursuing an advanced degree (M.D. and/or Ph.D.). To expand
opportunities for under-represented minority undergraduate students to participate in high quality, focused

10885031,"Cognitive Computing of Alzheimer’s Disease Genes and Risk
The molecular basis and genetic architecture of dementia remain a puzzle. As no drug yet prevents, delays, or
reverses it, aging populations potentially face a tidal threat of incipient and socially disruptive Alzheimer’s
Disease (AD) cases. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked over 100 loci with AD and explain
much of population attributable risk, but only a fraction of heritability. This heritability gap means it remains
difficult to design and assess which surveillance, screening, preventive, and stratification programs are effective.
In turn, this hinders therapeutic trials. The challenge in translating genetic variants into patient classifications is
twofold. First, AD is polygenic, so relevant disease driving mutations are spread thin across a multitude of
different genes and patients. Second, current interpretations of the deleterious effects of mutations lack
accuracy, so the impactful few cannot be distinguished from the benign multitude in any given subject. These
problems compound and fog the statistical genetics of AD risk and morbidity with poor signal to noise ratio. The
crux of our solution is to add a massive amount of new information, exploit it efficiently through computation,
then perform rigorous multi-pronged experimental validation. We start from the hypothesis that AD arises through
mutational perturbations that affect functional pathways beyond the built-in evolutionary tolerances. New
algorithms compute these excessive mutational forces and place them in integrative machine learning
frameworks to sort between AD patients and controls, and which can also reflect functional interactions among
proteins or genes. Innovations include a mathematical model of evolution based on calculus; ensemble machine
learning over human genome variations; and harmonic analysis of mutational perturbations in functional
networks. The outcome will, for the first time, integrate genomic variations relevant to AD in the context of all
relevant evolutionary history and all known functional interactions. In practice, this will increase power and
resolution, enable gender-specific analysis and AD stratification of men and women, and identify new and
experimentally validated AD genes. To carry out this program, AIM 1 will fuse a novel mathematical analysis of
evolution with machine learning and network wavelet theory. This will yield complementary integrative
approaches to identify genes and mutations that sort AD vs healthy subjects based on the abnormal mutational
burden of rare gene variants in sequenced cohorts. AIM 2 will focus similar tools on patients and controls with
known paradoxical phenotypes that run counter to their APOEɛ2/4 status. The results will identify modifier genes
that drive AD in APOEɛ2 carriers or that protect APOEɛ4 carriers from AD. AIM 3 will provide direct experimental
validation, leveraging high-throughput, robot-assisted genetic modifier screening in Drosophila models of Tau or
amyloid-beta peptide neurotoxicity. Promising targets will be further confirmed in mammalian neuronal cell
culture. The work will validate a new approach to enlarge our understanding of genetic complexity in Alzheimer’s
Disease for the identification of gene drivers and modifiers to guide clinical assessment of AD risk stratification."

Successful language comprehension requires mapping a complex and variable acoustic signal onto meaningful
units. Many studies show that perception of the speech signal recruits both left and right hemisphere temporal
brain regions, yet only individuals with left hemisphere damage typically have deficits in processing sound
structure that impact comprehension. A persistent mystery is the role of the right hemisphere in speech
perception. In the current proposal, we test two key hypotheses about the role of the right hemisphere in speech
sound processing. In Aim 1, a series of studies test the hypothesis that right and left temporal lobes differ in the
precision with which they respond to speech, with left hemisphere showing sharp, categorical responses and the
right having less precise and more gradient responses to speech. In Aim 2, motivated by work from the last grant
cycle, we test the role of the right hemisphere in a process that is key to efficient language processing: learning
the specific phonetic qualities of talkers. We approach these questions using converging methods, using neural
decoding techniques on functional neuroimaging (fMRI) data to measure differences in neural tuning to phonetic
stimuli, implementing a “virtual lesion” approach using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to examine the
consequences of left and right hemisphere disruption, and testing individuals with right and left temporal lesions
to understand the functional consequences of damage to the systems supporting speech perception in both
hemispheres. In concert, this work will delineate the neural systems that support efficient and flexible processing
of the speech signal. This grant’s innovation stems from its multi-method approach and the focus on right
hemisphere function, a neglected component of the language architecture. Finally, this line of work will inform
successful remediation of stroke, revealing the roles and functions of spared left and right hemisphere systems
that can be leveraged for therapeutic purposes."

 Chemical warfare agents such as mustards and arsenicals cause skin damage characterized by erythema,
inflammation, and skin blistering, followed by a prolonged healing period. Although inflammatory cells and
related cytokines are known to be increased in skin exposed to both mustards and arsenicals, similarities and
differences in the roles of subsets of these cells in mustard- or arsenical-induced skin damage, as well as
subsequent healing, remain to be elucidated. A goal of this proposal is to develop capacity to study the role of
the inflammatory response, particularly the macrophage response, using cutting edge single cell techniques, in
mustard and arsenical skin injury. This will include generating preliminary data with prototype agents and
planning for experiments with restricted agents to support future NIH CounterACT grant submissions in the
following aims: for Specific Aim 1, we will define the response of wound inflammatory cell subsets to vesicant
skin injury using nitrogen mustard (NM) as prototype mustard and phenylarsine oxide (PAO) as prototype
arsenical. For Specific Aim 2, since we and others have identified NLRP-3 is a key regulator of the
inflammatory response to skin injury, we will determine the role of the NOD-Like Receptor (NLRP)-3
inflammasome in vesicant skin injury and repair. For Specific Aim 3, we will develop a relationship with
MRIGlobal to perform studies with restricted vesicants. MRIGlobal is a contract research organization whose
laboratory is approved for use of more potent restricted vesicants. Successful completion of this project will 1)
bring a new skin wound healing research group into the chemical countermeasure field, 2) improve
understanding of the role of inflammatory cell subsets in the response to vesicant injury, 3) establish the
importance of the NLRP-3 inflammasome in regulating this inflammatory response and test an NLRP-3
inhibitor as a potential countermeasure and 4) develop a relationship with MRIGlobal for future studies using
restricted vesicants. Ultimately, we plan to use knowledge generated by our research to develop novel
countermeasures that target the inflammatory response."

Alzheimer’s disease is polygenic, yet the molecular functions and contributions to disease progression of many
genetic factors are not understood. Mob4 is a gene whose expression is significantly downregulated in
Alzheimer’s disease and whose function is yet to be determined. The goal of this research proposal is to
understand the molecular functions of Mob4 in neurons. Previous studies have shown that Mob4 is a core-
component of the STRIPAK complex, which contains kinases and the phosphatase PP2A. Mob4 contains a
conserved phospho-binding motif that in other Mob family proteins binds phosphorylated kinases. Our
preliminary studies show that the conserved phospho-binding motif is required for Mob4 function in neurons.
We propose that Mob4 functions, through its phospho-binding motif, to recruit a kinase into the STRIPAK
complex for PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation and a reduction in kinase activity. Aim 1 will address if the
phospho-binding motif of Mob4 is required for regulation of axonal transport and for long-term memory
formation, two neuronal processes that are disrupted in Alzheimer’s disease. Preliminary genetic interaction
studies suggest that Tao kinase activity is regulated by Mob4. Previous studies show that Tao kinase can
phosphorylate the microtubule associated protein Tau at phospho-sites associated with neurofibrillary tangle
formation in Alzheimer’s disease. Aim 2 will determine if Mob4 binds and regulates phospho-Tao kinase
activity and identify novel kinases that interact with Mob4. Our studies will provide new insights into the
mechanism of Mob4 functions and advance our understanding of how Mob4 dysfunction contributes to
Alzheimer’s disease."

Substance use and addiction pose significant and increasing challenges to public health. The distribution of
dopamine efferents from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and to the medial
prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been hypothesized to influence the predisposition to drug abuse. In addition, the
continued maturation of mesocortical projection into early adulthood renders it more susceptible to risk factors
such as exposure to drugs of abuse during adolescence. Netrin1/DCC-mediated signaling has emerged as a
key regulator of VTA dopamine circuit formation and maturation. However, while reducing DCC activity in mice
is shown to increase mesocortial projection, humans carrying monoallelic DCC mutations are found to have
reduced mesocortial connectivity. This notable discrepancy reflects a significant gap in knowledge as to how
DCC signaling directs VTA dopamine axon targeting and in turn influences addiction-related behaviors.
 Our recent study has identified novel genetic means to dampen and elevate DCC function by overexpressing
distinct receptor variants. Combining the new genetic approach, advanced whole brain imaging, and real-time in
vivo dopamine recording, we will test the central hypothesis that axon targeting in the mesocorticolimbic
pathway influences the functional responses to drugs of abuse. Specifically in this pilot study, we will investigate
how bidirectional changes in DCC signaling alters mesocortical connection, particularly during the circuit
maturation through adolescence. We will determine both anatomical and functional changes and also correlate
these changes with addition-related behaviors in mice.
Aim 1: Determine how changes in DCC activity affects mesocortical axon connection.
Using the Cre-loxP system, we will dampen or elevate DCC signaling by overexpressing distinct DCC isoforms
specifically in VTA dopamine neurons and during adolescent development. We will follow the resulting VTA axon
projection with a tdTomato reporter in the intact brain, using high-speed high-resolution ribbon scanning confocal
microscopy after tissue clearing. Completion of this aim will allow us to compare how bidirectional changes in
DCC signaling impact mesocortical circuit maturation. It will also help distinguish different possibilities that could
contribute to the discrepancy between mice and humans regarding mesocortical connectivity.
Aim 2. Determine how changes in DCC activity affects dopamine release in the mPFC during behavioral
responses to drugs of abuse.
Using the same genetic approach to induce bidirectional changes in DCC signaling as in Aim 1, we will also
determine the corresponding alterations in dopamine release in the mPFC and the effects on animal behaviors.
Using dLight1.3b fluorescent indicator and fiber photometry, we will follow real-time dopamine dynamics in the
mPFC during conditioned place preference testing. This will help determine the functional outcomes of altered
mesocortical circuit maturation and delineate the anatomical-structural relationship in the dopamine circuit."

Norovirus, rotavirus and adenovirus are the major causes of severe viral gastroenteritis in children
worldwide. This project aims to monitor the prevalence, genetic diversity, predominant and
emerging strains of these viruses in South Africa (SA) over a 5-year period. In addition, the project
will investigate the humoral response to norovirus infections and determine to which norovirus
genotypes children in SA are exposed to in the first two years of life, and when protective
antibodies are generated. We will perform parallel gastroenteritis virus surveillance 1) in children
(<5 years of age) hospitalised with gastroenteritis, and 2) in wastewater influent from 11 sentinel
wastewater treatment plants across SA. Complete genomes of the predominant norovirus,
rotavirus and adenovirus genotypes will be determined by next generation sequencing to study
the global emergence and diversification of these viruses. A protein microarray approach will be
used to evaluate antibodies to a range of norovirus genotypes in children in SA. Dried blood spot
specimens from HIV exposed children that were submitted for HIV testing, will be accessed once
HIV testing is complete. Children will be classified in five age groups between birth and 2 years
of age. Initially we will characterise the immune response against 20 norovirus strains which
circulated in hospitalised children and in the environment in the recent past. The range of
norovirus genotypes will be expanded during the project to reflect the current strains detected in
clinical and environmental surveillance. In addition, the fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2) secretor
status (which is linked to norovirus and rotavirus susceptibility) will be determined in an effort to
better understand the link between secretor status and infection with various norovirus and
rotavirus genotypes. Finally, the functionality of the detected antibodies will be evaluated in terms
of their avidity and ability to block binding between the norovirus major capsid protein (VP1) and
histo-blood group antigens. A luciferase-VP1 fusion protein immunoprecipitation assay will be
used to detect genotype-specific blocking antibodies. Seroprevalence and antibody
characteristics will be compared between the five age groups 0-1 month (maternal antibodies), 2-
6 months (maternal antibodies), 7-12 months, 13-18 months and 19-24 months. This project
should generate valuable data to better understand the diversity of norovirus infections and the
immune response to these infections in young children. The combination of seroprevalence
results with clinical and environmental data collected during the same time period will provide
valuable information on the importance of the environmental strains in norovirus exposure in
young children."

New generation pod-style nicotine salt e-cigarettes (e-cigspod) are popular because of their sleek design and
ability to deliver nicotine levels similar to those of conventional tobacco cigarettes (cigs). Nicotine salts are easier
to inhale than the free-base form of nicotine found in previous generation e-cigs. While the long-term health
impact of cig smoke is well known, the consequences of chronic e-cig use remain in question, and data is needed
to justify immediate FDA regulations. A substantial portion of smokers are unsuccessful in using e-cigs to support
their cessation efforts and instead become dual users. The chemical profile of cig smoke and e-cigpod aerosols
is different, which suggests that the health effects of chronic smoking and vaping may not fully overlap. Building
upon this, we hypothesize that cig smoking and e-cigpod vaping, are independent risk factors for cardiopulmonary
disease, whose superposition exacerbates the maladaptive remodeling of the lungs, heart, and vasculature
compared to either practice alone. To test this hypothesis, we will expose hypercholesterolemic and wildtype
mice to nebulized nicotine, aerosolized solvent carrier, e-cigpod aerosols, and cig smoke (naïve mice), or a
combination of the two (both naïve and previously cig smoke-exposed mice) and we will compare the structural
and functional remodeling of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. We will generate e-cigpod aerosols from
pods in Tobacco flavor at 5% nicotine strength. Motivated by the idea that smokers who use e-cigs as cessation
aids may vape until they satisfy their nicotine cravings, we will perform experiments to achieve equal cotinine
bioavailability in the mouse blood, while maintaining the same daily duration of exposure. We will measure the
mechanical properties of the of aorta (tissue stiffness, distensibility, and elastic storage), heart (fractional
shortening and ejection fractions), and lungs (resistance and elastance). We will characterize tissue
microstructure (air space sizes, collagen content, and elastic fiber integrity) to highlight the factors that most
contribute to the observed functional changes. Knowledge gained from this project will provide scientific evidence
in support of data-driven e-cig regulation under The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act
(FSPTCA), specifically concerning the health risks of dual combustible and electronic cigarette use."

Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is the most common cause of adult-onset muscular dystrophy and the second most
common cause of muscular dystrophy overall. Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) results from an expanded
CTG repeat in the 3’ untranslated region of the DMPK gene. The molecular basis for pathogenesis is a toxic
gain of function of the RNA transcribed from the mutant allele that contains long tracts of expanded CUG
repeats (CUGexp RNA). CUGexp RNA remains in the nucleus bound with proteins to form ribonucleoprotein
complexes (RNPs) detected as foci by RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization. CUGexp RNPs include the
Muscleblind-Like (MBNL) paralogs, MBNL1 and MBNL2, that are sequestered resulting in their loss of function
and a primary cause of pathogenesis. CUGexp RNPs are dynamic nuclear structures that are the cause and
therapeutic target of DM1 pathogenesis yet knowledge of the composition of the CUGexp RNP is limited and a
full accounting of the mechanisms of CUGexp RNA toxicity in skeletal muscle remains to be established. To
gain insight into the molecular and cellular biology of CUGexp RNA and the CUGexp RNP in skeletal muscle,
we will use proximity labeling to identify protein and RNA components of the CUGexp RNP complex in addition
to MBNL and CUGexp RNA and determine their roles in CUGexp RNA pathogenesis in skeletal muscle. The
results will provide the foundation to identify novel therapeutic targets and enhance the efficiency of current
approaches targeting the CUGexp RNA component of the RNP."

HPV infections are the most common sexually transmitted diseases and the primary cause of cervical cancer.
Cervical cancer remains to be the fourth most common female malignancy and the second most common
female cancer in women aged 15 to 44 years and is estimated to cause 91% of HPV-related cancer deaths.
Every year approximately 5.5 million new HPV infections are reported in the U.S; Although 90% of infections
can be cleared within two years, about 10% persistent HPV infections will ultimately progress to invasive
cancers. The current prophylactic HPV vaccines (Gardasil and Cervarix) cannot clear established infections,
which could take up to 25 years to progress to malignancy. Clinical management of HPV-related cancers is
challenging because the robust early diagnostics and curative treatments are yet to be developed. HPV
persistence is one key factor for cervical cancer. Accumulated evidence has demonstrated that women with
high levels of bacterial vaginosis (BV)-associated anaerobic organisms are at increased risk of HPV
persistence. However, the cause/effect of BV in cervical cancer remains elusive. Surprisingly little is known
about the molecular processes underpinning the relationship between BV-associated bacteria and HPV
because co-infection model systems have not been established. The interdisciplinary team of Dr. Gilbert for
vaginal microbiome and Dr. Hu for papillomavirus will be most suitable to develop a co-infection model to study
the dynamic roles of vaginal bacteria and papillomavirus persistence during cervical cancer development. Our
overarching hypotheses guiding this proposal are that BV bacteria promote HPV persistence and tumor
progression, and sex hormone contraceptives promote HPV persistence and cancer by disrupting the vaginal
microbiome. More specifically, we will test these hypotheses in two specific aims of the current proposal: 1) BV
bacteria promote HPV persistence and cancers by degrading the vaginal mucus barrier, disturbing the vaginal
epithelium and/or by modulating host inflammatory responses to HPV infections (Aim 1). 2) Sex hormonal
contraceptives promote HPV persistence and cancer in the genital tract by disrupting the vaginal microbiome
(Aim 2). The rationales for these aims are based on previous published studies and current needs. Two
common contraceptives depo medroxy-progesterone acetate (DMPA) and 17 beta-estradiol may impair
colonization of lactobacilli and possibly compromise the vaginal barrier to viral infections leading to HPV
persistence and cancer. We will develop a new co-infection mouse model system based on the expertise of
two teams in two novel mouse models necessary to directly examine the basic premise of our hypotheses in
two specific Aims. These studies will provide a starting place for more detailed microbiological and biochemical
examinations of the mechanisms driving the BV-HPV association in cervical cancer. Findings of the current
proposed study will have significant implications not only in providing novel insight to both the vaginal
microbiome and papillomavirus fields but also in identifying interventions for future translational studies."

This application is for secondary analyses to determine the long-term effect of treatment, clinical

OHTS is the only US study with 20-year clinical and VRQOL outcomes in a cohort of 1,636
participants with ocular hypertension. The 20 year follow-up is meaningful because it
approaches the life expectation of participants whose median age was 55 at baseline. Aim 1 will
report cross-sectional 20 year data from the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire
(NEI VFQ) and 15 item Glaucoma Quality Life survey (GQL-15). Aim 2 will focus on
longitudinal changes in clinical and VRQOL in the inception cohort of participants who
developed POAG in OHTS 1 or 2. Pre-POAG VRQOL data collected in the inception cohort will
allow statistical adjustment for individual differences on post-POAG VRQOL which will
increase precision of post-POAG impact on VRQOL. Accurate dates of POAG diagnosis in the
inception cohort will enable a rigorous test of the effect of duration and rate of change in clinical
parameters on VRQOL. We will analyze treatment, clinical and demographic factors affecting
VRQOL in the cross-sectional sample at 20 years of follow-up (Aim 1) and in the longitudinal

10759432,"Previously, using a phage peptide display library, our group has identified Plasmodium parasite ligands and
corresponding host cell receptors important for sporozoite-Kupffer cell interaction in the mammalian liver.
Using a similar approach, we identified the HP1 peptide, a structural mimic of a ligand that the sporozoite
uses to infect hepatocytes. Immunization with the HP1 peptide protects ~ 50 % mice from P. berghei
challenge. Using an anti-HP1 antibody, we identified Plasmodium Phospholipid Scramblase (PLS) as the
sporozoite ligand of hepatocytes and a potential vaccine antigen. We propose 1) to identify PLS protein
epitopes that function in hepatocyte recognition, for use as a vaccine antigen; and 2) to develop a tri-
functional vaccine antigen containing i) a sporozoite circumsporozoite protein (CSP) epitope, targeting liver
sinusoid binding, ii) a sporozoite GAPDH-related epitope, targeting sporozoite exit from the circulation via
Kupffer cell traversal, and iii) sporozoite PLS epitope, targeting hepatocyte infection. We expect that this
approach will lead to enhancement of the moderate protective efficacy of the most advanced RTS,S/AS01

Chronic alcohol drinking has been linked to the development and progression of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) by
means of damaging cellular DNA, which results in cell death of hepatocytes, contributing to alcoholic
steatohepatitis, liver fibrosis, and potentially liver cancers. However, it remains unclear how alcohol promotes
DNA damage responses in ALD development and understanding the underlying mechanisms may yield insight
into therapeutic approaches toward treating ALD. In the pilot studies, it was demonstrated that aspartate beta-
hydroxylase (ASPH) is down-regulated in the rodent livers derived from the ethanol-fed group. In addition, DNA
damage markers, including γ-H2aX (a phosphorylated form of H2aX) and GADD45α, were found elevated when
compared to the control-diet fed group. The liver is predominantly composed of hepatocytes whose function is
critical in the maintenance of homeostasis thereof. Thus, we investigated whether there is a correlation between
ASPH and DNA damage in human hepatocytes. We ectopically expressed ASPH and challenged hepatocytes
with DNA damage inducers. Intriguingly, the expression of ASPH almost eliminated γ-H2aX expression; however,
knockdown of ASPH substantially promoted DNA damage. These observations suggest a protective role of
ASPH in the DNA damage response. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that chronic alcohol
consumption leads to ASPH down-regulation in the liver contributing to DNA damage responses and
hepatocyte cell death in chronic liver disease progression. Our long-term goal is to understand how ASPH
is involved in ethanol-induced hepatocyte DNA damage and the consequent impacts on ALD progression. To
test our hypothesis and achieve this goal, two specific aims are proposed. In aim 1, we will investigate how
the expression of ASPH alters ALD progression in vivo. We will determine if targeting hepatic ASPH using
an AAV strategy will exacerbate DNA damage and cell death in the hepatocytes of ethanol-fed mice. Furthermore,
we investigate if overexpression of ASPH protects hepatocytes in an ALD model. In aim 2, we will decipher
the mechanism by which ASPH protects hepatocytes from DNA damage induced cell death. We will
determine how ASPH is involved in ethanol-mediated DNA damage by using CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out ASPH
or ectopically expressing ASPH via a lentiviral system. To delineate the mechanisms involved in this regulation,
we will determine how the enzymatic functions of ASPH are associated with the ASPH-mediated DNA damage
responses and cell death. Using the proteomic approach, we will also illustrate innovative ASPH downstream
targets upon ethanol treatment. The results will significantly advance our understanding of the molecular
mechanisms in hepatocyte cell death and pathophysiological mechanisms underlying ALD progression. We also
anticipate that it will broaden our knowledge of ASPH expression and its relationship to hepatocyte function in
general."

Cardiovascular disease continues to be a dominant cause of morbidity and mortality in the
United States and throughout the world. While many gains have been achieved in some areas,
the epidemic of obesity, diabetes, and life-style risk factors is contributing to expanding
prevalence of heart failure. The advances made over the past decade have resulted from the
dedication and talents of many researchers in basic, translational, clinical, and population
epidemiological scientific inquiry. For nearly 45 years, The Johns Hopkins T32 Program in
Cardiovascular Disease has trained many of these researchers, and with this renewal proposal
we aim to continue this success. Our philosophy is to provide a broad-based, multi- and inter-
disciplinary research environment with which to train post-doctoral fellows in basic, translational,
clinical, and/or population science. Our program accepts physicians in Cardiology - some with
PhDs as well who are dedicated to pursuing an academic research career, as well as non-
clinical trainees (PhD or MD) pursuing cardiovascular science. This mixture of basic and clinical
scientists has fostered an unusual environment conducive to out-of-the-box thinking and
translation of novel approaches to new understandings and treatment of cardiovascular disease.
While centered in the Division of Cardiology, the program engages faculty throughout the Johns
Hopkins Medical Institutions with expertise and interest in cardiovascular research. This
includes faculty in Divisions/Departments of Pulmonary Medicine, Pediatrics, Epidemiology,
Pathology, Biomedical Engineering, Computer Science, and Genetic Medicine. All have long-
standing collaborations with Cardiology Division faculty. The primary areas of research covered
in our program encompass basic science in ventricular and vascular pathobiology, pulmonary
hypertension; regenerative cell biology and tissue engineering; immunology and metabolism;
computational modeling, and bioinformatics including artificial intelligence and deep learning.
Clinical and translational research focuses on heart failure, electrophysiology, cardiovascular
imaging, and interventional cardiology. Large population studies focus on epidemiological
studies and health care delivery. The program supports 12 positions for generally 2 years of
research training. It also includes two positions with a structured year of formal course work to
provide a master’s degree or certificate program in clinical investigation, epidemiology or public
health. With this renewal, we continue our primary goal of providing leadership in academic
cardiology, training future leaders in all levels of research to help combat cardiovascular disease."

vascular remodeling with abnormal cellular proliferation and fibrosis. This leads to an obstructive vasculopathy
of the pulmonary arterioles, resulting in pulmonary hypertension (PH) and progressive right heart failure that lead
to morbidity and mortality. Hemodynamics and right heart function are commonly used to diagnose disease and
monitor progression and response to therapy. However, these readouts are altered in other common heart and
lung diseases and their changes are not specific to pulmonary vascular remodeling. This lack of specificity has
resulted in critical unmet need for noninvasive approaches for directly monitoring pulmonary vascular remodeling
in PAH that could be used to guide treatment in patients, thereby improving their health outcomes. To address
this need, we have developed 129Xe magnetic resonance imaging (129Xe MRI) as a method to produce
quantitative 3D maps of gas transfer across the pulmonary blood-gas barrier. 129Xe MRI has a distinct PAH
signature and can simultaneously measure capillary blood volume and hemodynamic changes associated with
pulmonary vascular remodeling. The objective of this project is to associate pathologic pulmonary vascular
remodeling in PAH at a cellular and pathological level with specific changes in gas exchange physiology and
hemodynamics. We hypothesize that different types of remodeling, such as inflammation, fibrosis and
proliferation, result in unique changes in gas exchange physiology and hemodynamics that can be monitored
with 129Xe MRI. Our preliminary studies have identified a 129Xe MRI signatures that differentiates PAH from other
common heart and lung diseases. This technology is also sensitive to early pulmonary vascular remodeling 1-2
weeks after exposure to monocrotaline (MCT) in a preclinical rat PH model. We will extend these studies and
determine our objective via the following specific aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the relationship between
pulmonary vascular remodeling and both gas exchange and hemodynamic abnormalities in PAH patients
undergoing lung transplant, to correlate lung pathology and cellular identity with defects in 129Xe MRI gas
exchange and spectroscopy. In Aim 2, we will determine the sensitivity of different monitoring approaches to
early remodeling and response to therapy in the MCT and Sugen-hypoxia preclinical models of PH. In Aim 3, we
will determine the ability of 129Xe MRI to longitudinally monitor disease progression in patients. The expected
outcomes of this project will be a direct link between pulmonary vascular remodeling and changes in lung
physiology, along with a novel, noninvasive biomarker for its monitoring. This proposed research is significant
because it will define the mechanistic links between pulmonary vascular remodeling and changes in gas
exchange physiology and hemodynamics in PAH. These studies will have an important positive impact because
they lay the foundation for a strategy of noninvasive diagnosis and monitoring of PAH activity in the clinic."
10839418,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL) arise from germinal center (GC) B cells; a
stage at which precursor B cells undergo rounds of proliferation, edit their immunoglobulins by somatic
hypermutation and class-switch recombination, followed by affinity selection via interactions with T follicular
helper (Tfh) cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs). The entry to, and exit from, the GC reaction requires
extensive changes in gene expression that are controlled by transcription factors that recruit co-activators or co-
repressors that drive epigenetic and transcriptional changes. The dysregulation of these molecular programs
perturbs the normal B cell differentiation and contributes to FL/DLBCLs. Prior studies indicate that (a) EZH2
regulates the hyperproliferative nature of GC B cells and (b) gain-of-function mutations of the EZH2 Y641 residue
“initiate” lymphomagenesis by attenuating GC B cell requirement for Tfh cell help and shifting the dependency
to FDCs through increased expression of receptors through which B-cells interface with these stromal cells.
Ezh2Y641F GC B cells evade Tfh-directed clonal selection and affinity maturation to escape Tfh-mediated
elimination, leading to lymphomagenesis. Notably, compared to EZH2WT, GC B cells carrying Ezh2Y641F show
increased and decreased BAFFR and CD40 expressions, respectively, and escape CD40L blockade-mediated
impairment of GC reaction. It is unclear whether the impairment of Tfh help manifests as dysregulation of the
mechanical control of Tfh–B immunological synapse (IS) and alteration of their intercellular receptor-ligand
interactions and signaling in FL/DLBCLs. The overarching hypothesis is that in contrast to GC B cells with
EZH2WT, the EZH2Y641 mutation in GCB DLBCL/FL results in dysregulation of key immunoreceptors mediating
the interactions of GC B cells with Tfh cells and FDCs manifesting as altered receptor forces, ligand binding, and
mechanotransduction. The dysregulated receptor mechanobiology impacts downstream B cell signaling,
epigenetics, and sensing of lymphoid microenvironmental cues responsible for extinguishing the “pseudo-
malignant” phenotype of GC B cells, thereby driving the cancerous transformation of B cells. Our transcriptomic
analysis suggests changes in the levels of proteins involved in B–FDC and B–Tfh interactions, which should
affect cellular function. The goal is to understand how the dynamic epigenetic states of DLBCL/FL-driving
EZH2Y641 mutations dysregulate B cell mechanobiology, leading to malignancy."

 The number of funded physician-scientists in the United States has decreased steadily since the 1970s
and the numbers are most alarming for surgeon-scientists. Currently, only 6% of U.S. surgeons have funding
from the National Institutes of Health (NIH)1. From 2006 to 2016, NIH funding for surgery departments
decreased by $2.79 million per year and funding success rates for surgeons declined by 0.21% per year2.
Contemporaneously, publication impact factors and the career development conversion rate (K to R) for
surgeons increased, suggesting the quality of surgical research continues to increase. A recent report from the
NIH expressed concerned about the capacity to translate research into clinical care and policy as the number
of well-trained individuals who cross the bench to bedside divide drops3.
 There are two evidence-based interventions that effectively promote surgeon engagement in research. The
integration of a two-year research fellowship into general surgery residency increases the likelihood of an
academic career. The track record of our training program, which has adhered to this model over the last 20
years, is strong with the majority of our trainees receiving subsequent funding and/or an appointment in an
academic department. Recent evidence shows that the presence of PhD-scientists in a department of surgery
strongly correlates with increased departmental research productivity as well as increased productivity for
individual surgeon-scientists4. We therefore propose the following specific objectives for our training program:
 1. To provide training in the conduct of basic, translational, clinical and health services surgical oncology
 research through a tailored, didactic, postdoctoral research experience;
 2. To increase the number of well-trained PhD-scientists with a focus in surgical oncology;
 3. To develop scientists and surgeon-scientists as academic leaders with an emphasis on multidisciplinary
 and translational research as the next generation of surgical researchers in oncology.
To meet these objectives, the University of Wisconsin (UW) Surgical Oncology Training (UW-SORT) Program
utilizes the extensive resources of the UW Department of Surgery, UW Carbone Cancer Center (UWCCC), the
McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, the Wisconsin Surgical Outcomes Research Program (WiSOR) and
the UW Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR) to provide world-class, mentored training in the
research methodologies necessary to develop productive NIH-funded research programs in surgical oncology.
The core of our training program is a strong and diverse pool of experienced, extramurally funded trainers from
a variety of surgical oncology-related disciplines. The trainee's practical research experience is supported by
appropriate didactics, effective assessment processes, a plan to promote diversity by recruiting and retaining
both women and minorities, and a comprehensive plan for training in the responsible conduct of research."

Detecting early signs of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) during the prodromal
stage of AD is becoming increasingly important for cost-effective clinical trials, developing targeted intervention
strategies, and gaining maximum benefit from currently available treatment plans. However, because of
substantial differences in the manifestation of cognitive impairment, preclinical cognitive changes are not
discernible from age-related cognitive decline. Although a combined approach of using neuropsychological, fluid,
and imaging biomarkers has relatively improved the timely diagnosis of AD, measurement of these biomarkers
is expensive and highly technology-dependent, making these techniques impractical for use in many older adults
across different settings. In addition, assessment of cognitive functions through the use of neuropsychological
batteries remains the gold-standard in clinical trials and evaluation of intervention efficacy. Thus, it is critical to
identify early detectors that are 1) sensitive to pathologies of AD, 2) strongly predictive of future change in
cognition, and 3) accessible and feasible across diverse settings. Based on our recent findings, which have
identified measures of speech motor control as a powerful aid in indexing early stages of neurodegenerative
diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and primary progressive aphasia, we propose assessment of
speech markers as an alternative or complementary and ecologically valid strategy for identifying adults at risk
of developing cognitive impairment due to AD. Speech production is one of humans’ most complex motor
behaviors, as it relies on tight integration of cognition, sensory, and motor processes which are all subject to
change with advancing age. We hypothesize that the rate of age-related changes in speech motor control of
adults can be influenced by genetic susceptibility to develop AD. In addition, we hypothesize that measures of
speech elicited during cognitively-demanding speech tasks can differentiate carriers of APOE ε4 (i.e., the major
gene known to increase AD risk) from noncarriers and that baseline speech acoustic and kinematic measures
can predict later cognitive decline. The proposed research will innovatively use acoustics and articulatory
kinematics in combination with neuroimaging to pursue three Aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the effect of aging
on speech motor control of adults with APOE ε4 positive (ε4+) and APOE ε4 negative (ε4-) genotypes matched
in sex and education. In Aim 2, we will identify the brain structural and resting-state functional bases for age-
related changes in speech measures of adults with ε4+ and ε4- genotypes. Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine
1) whether baseline speech acoustic/ kinematic measures predict cognitive change over two years, as quantified
by Hopkins Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) and Trail Making Test (TMT) scores; and 2) if speech and cognitive
changes are mediated through alterations in brain structure and function. The findings of this study will provide
critical information about measures of speech motor control that can be efficiently incorporated into
neuropsychological testing to optimize the clinical assessment of AD."
10910902,"Since its founding in 1983, the Columbus CCOP, now known as the Columbus NCORP, has
been dedicated to providing high quality cancer care options in Central and Southeast Ohio as
well as advancing cancer research through cancer research trials. The Columbus NCORP has
grown in that time to encompass 20 affiliates and sub-affiliates, with 100 doctors serving as
investigators. The NCORP serves a wide variety of populations, from urban areas to rural
Appalachia. Over the six years comprising the next grant period, the NCORP plans to continue
to grow in that capacity, improving its ability to participate in, assist with the design of, and
successfully implement a wide range of cancer research trials, including treatment, cancer
control, screening/surveillance, side effect prevention/management, and cancer care delivery
research studies. In all areas the NCORP has been successful and plans to continue to grow in
its ability to investigate health disparities in its region and increase participation in cancer
research by underserved communities including minority populations, rural communities and
those in Appalachian areas. Cancer care delivery research has been and continues to be a key
component of this goal, as is continuing to improve care practices throughout the consortium.
Close collaboration between NCORP affiliate institutions, non-oncology specialists, primary
care physicians and community organizations is key to this goal. The Columbus NCORP plans
to continue to pursue the cutting edge of cancer research through targeted and genomic
therapies, while simultaneously seeking out and implementing trials that are directly applicable
to those cancers with the highest incidence rate in our region: breast, colon and lung cancers.
Over the past five years as an NCORP, and over the preceding 30 years as the Columbus CCOP,
these areas have been a high priority and will continue to be as we aggressively pursue
treatments that will advance the science of cancer care and best serve our local communities.
The unique challenges facing Central and Southeast Ohio in these areas position the Columbus
NCORP to make real and lasting contributions to cancer research, and the lessons learned here
are widely applicable to regions across the country."

 Synthetic biology aims to harness the power of biological systems to dynamically access information in
the cell, enabling synthetic biomedical tasks such as tumor surveillance, pathogen identification, or cell-fate
reprogramming. Such tasks in cellular engineering rely on robust mechanisms to regulate transgenes for the
delivery of enzymes, genetic corrections, and cellular therapies. To unleash its full potential, mammalian
synthetic biology requires foundational tools for implementing reliable control of gene expression in primary cells.
For example, transgene silencing (e.g. loss of expression) remains a common challenge to effectively
engineering primary cells. Layers of regulation across a range of length- and time-scales coordinate events from
molecular binding to cell signaling regulate gene expression and thus cell fate. Multiscale approaches are
needed to integrate the diverse processes that control cell-fate transitions. Cell-fate transitions represent pivotal
events requiring coordination of multiple processes from epigenetic and cytoskeletal remodeling to proliferation
and transcription. Understanding these transitions may illuminate how oncogenes coopt these processes to drive
cellular transformation. Here, we propose a multiscale approach for understanding and engineering cell-fate
transitions (e.g. reprogramming, differentiation).
 From our previous work to identify principles of cell-fate transitions, we identified systems-level
constraints that limited reprogramming and developed a cocktail that increased reprograming 100-fold in mouse
cells. Comparing the human and mouse response to reprogramming, we identified species-specific differences
in proliferation, signaling, and the innate immune response during reprogramming that may contribute to lower
reprogramming rates for human cells. We propose to examine these molecular correlates to determine how each
impacts the reprogramming process and outcomes. We will use these insights to design genetic controllers to
guide cells through reprogramming. Already we have identified a strategy to optimize reprogramming by inducing
a transient “erase” phase followed by a “write” phase to establish the new cell fate. We propose to develop
controllers capable of autonomously guiding cells through these competing objectives to enhance the efficiency
of reprogramming. Genetic controllers are composed from synthetic gene circuits connected to native gene
regulatory networks. While significant efforts have been devoted to the logical design of enhanced synthetic
circuitry (e.g. circuits for synchronized quorum sensing, edge-detection), less is understood regarding how
cellular hardware and the emergent three-dimensional structure of genetic elements affect circuits. Here, we
propose to improve our understanding how transcription reshapes DNA and how it impacts the performance of
gene circuits. Defining the role of chromatin structure in cellular identity will guide molecular engineering efforts
to build genetic controllers capable of regulating behavior. We anticipate that the principles and tools we develop
will be broadly applicable across cellular engineering applications as well as for investigating cell-fate transitions."
10673810,"Project Summary: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is associated with an increased risk for psychiatric
disorders, including psychosis with similar symptoms to individuals with idiopathic schizophrenia (SZ), and
about 1-2% of cases of idiopathic SZ have 22q11.2 deletions. Thus, targeted approaches detailing specific
brain dysfunction in 22q11DS may elucidate critical neural mechanisms in psychosis. Specifically, approaches
that capture abnormalities common to individuals at-risk for psychosis and with a genetic risk to psychosis,
such as 22q11DS, may help explain risk and resilience for psychosis. Minor physical anomalies (MPAs) are
phenotypic abnormalities of aberrant development. MPAs include subtle abnormalities of morphological
structures encompassing numerous body parts including eyes, ears, mouth and head. Abnormalities of the
face and head likely represent a disruption of early embryologic development, including the olfactory system
and facial morphology, making these promising entry points for understanding neurodevelopmental
neuropathology associated with 22q11DS and psychosis In this study, we seek to compare 1) measures of
olfactory function; 2) structural abnormalities of the olfactory system and 3) structural abnormalities of the face
in a large cohort of patients with 22q11DS (n=100), including those with and without psychosis, to typically
developing (TD) individual. Finally, we will employ machine learning algorithms to select features that best
differentiate 22q11DS+ from 22q11DS- and use those features to classify individual with idiopathic risk for
psychosis (PS). In addition, analyses will leverage recent advances in machine learning to predict salient
features associated with dimensional measures of psychosis. We believe this innovative approach can
significantly advance our understanding of the etiology of psychosis and provide advances to precision
medicine in psychiatry. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a
substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of psychosis."
10913361,"Project summary: This project will develop and validate a comprehensive toolset of novel technologies for
imaging axonal projections across scales, and will deploy this toolset to map a complex system of cortico-
subcortical projections in the macaque and human brain. We will combine the complementary strengths of
three innovative microscopy techniques. First, polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT)
will provide label-free, undistorted imaging of axonal orientations at the scale of microscopic fascicles, allowing
us to follow fascicles across the brain without the need for axon segmentation. Second, whole-mount light-
sheet microscopy (LSM) of cleared and immunolabeled sections will allow us to image fascicles at the sub-
micron scale, resolving individual axons. Third, hierarchical phase-contrast tomography (HiP-CT) will allow us
to image both the axons and their micro-environment, at a range of scales from a few microns down to sub-
micron. We will scale these three microscopy techniques up to image a large sub-volume of the brain (up to
two thirds of a hemisphere) that contains subcortical projections of the motor, premotor, and prefrontal cortex.
In the macaque brains, fluorescent tracer injections will allow direct validation of our novel microscopy
techniques. In combination with an extensive collection of prior tracer injections, the macaque data will also
provide the topographic organizational rules of fibers in cortico-subcortical bundles, which we will then use to
validate our novel microscopy techniques in human brains. In both macaque and human specimens, we will
also collect extensive, cutting-edge, whole-brain diffusion MRI data, which will provide the link to non-invasive
neuroimaging. The unprecedented datasets generated by our project will enable research discovery in two use
cases. In the first use case, we will annotate projections of the motor, premotor, and prefrontal cortex to the
subthalamic nucleus (STN). We will use them to advance our understanding of circuits associated with clinical
improvements in four diseases that are treated with deep-brain stimulation in neighboring subzones of the
STN: dystonia, Tourette’s syndrome, Parkinson’s disease, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. In the second
use case, we will investigate the mapping from the axonal orientations and microstructural features obtained
from the microscopy data to dMRI signals acquired in the same brains. In addition to the unprecedented
datasets and the two use cases described above, this project will generate state-of-the-art pipelines for pre-
processing, co-registration, axon segmentation, tractography, and quantification, across the scales spanned by
the acquired data. We will develop a novel platform for sharing the microscopy, tracer, and MRI data with the
research community. This will go well beyond a static data repository, allowing the user to interact with the data
remotely and providing a “validation engine” for testing neuroimaging software tools against the gold standard
post mortem data collected by this project. If successful, this project will generate a scalable and validated
toolset for imaging connectional anatomy, with a direct link it to its applications in the study of human disease."
10930835,"PROJECT SUMMARY & ABSTRACT
By 2045, most of the new cases of diabetes will occur in low- and middle- income countries (LMIC) like India,
but 50% of those afflicted will not know. Improving postpartum diabetes screening for women with gestational
diabetes (GDM) – a marker of high risk for progression to type 2 diabetes (T2DM) – can help close this
diagnostic gap. This is particularly important in India, where few women with GDM receive postpartum T2DM
screening, even though 25% of women with GDM develop T2DM within the first year postpartum. Improving
T2DM screening during the critical life stages of pregnancy and postpartum will help prevent the sequelae
of untreated diabetes, including cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death among Indian women.
In partnership with the Deep Griha Society and King Edward Memorial Hospital Research Center, we propose
a hybrid type II effectiveness-implementation cluster randomized trial to evaluate if community health workers
(CHW) can improve postpartum T2DM screening in the urban slums of Pune, India. We will screen pregnant
women living in slum communities in India for GDM during pregnancy. The slum communities will be
randomized in equal number to one of two study arms: (1) the home-based testing arm, where women with
GDM will be offered the WHO-recommended oral glucose tolerance test for T2DM screening in their homes;
and (2) the referral arm, where women with GDM will be referred for clinic-based postpartum T2DM screening.
Through a mixed-methods approach, we will determine the impact of CHW-delivered services on the uptake of
postpartum T2DM testing as well as factors pertaining to intervention implementation. Our specific aims are to:
1. Determine the uptake of postpartum T2DM screening in home testing versus referral arms
 among women with GDM in Pune, India. The primary outcome is uptake of postpartum T2DM
 screening in women with GDM. We hypothesize that 70% of women in the home testing arm will accept
 screening for T2DM within one-year postpartum compared to 45% in the referral arm
2. Evaluate implementation of the CHW-delivered programs using a convergent, mixed methods study
 design and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). We will collect
 qualitative and quantitative data from Aim 1 participants with GDM in both study arms, as well as from
 CHW, clinical staff, and Ministry of Health Officials to systematically evaluate CFIR Domains.
This will be the first study to determine if trained CHW can improve postpartum T2DM screening in urban
Indian slums. The results of this study will improve uptake of postpartum T2DM screening, identify low-income
women at the highest risk of postpartum T2DM in India, and potentially identify novel approaches for improving
postpartum screening for other diseases in low- and middle-income countries, in line with the NIH PAR-22-132."
10808105,"A broad consensus regarding HIV vaccine development calls for engineering antigens that elicit production
of antibodies like the known Broadly Neutralizing (BN) Monoclonal Antibodies (MAbs). Two Env BN MAb
binding sites, the Membrane Proximal External Region (MPER) and Fusion Peptide (FP), are attractive targets
because they are linear peptides. We developed a new, low cost, globally appropriate vaccine platform: Killed
Whole Cell (KWC) Genome-Reduced E. coli (grEc), with vaccine antigens expressed on bacterial surfaces
using Gram- autotransporters. Using synthetic biology, testable vaccine candidates can be made in ~3 wks for
~$50 each. Vaccines made with the platform will cost ~$1/dose, can be produced in existing factories globally,
and have forgiving cold chain requirements. We made coronavirus FP vaccines using the KWC grEc platform
and showed clinical efficacy in an animal model. We propose to make KWC grEc HIV vaccines targeting
MPER and FP. Our preliminary data show that we can express HIV MPER and FP Ags with this approach and
elicit HIV neutralizing sera in mice using an MPER-derived Ag. We hypothesize that the KWC grEc platform,
targeting MPER and FP, will yield safe, effective, low cost, globally appropriate HIV vaccines.
 In PHASE 1, Aim 1, we will synthesize DNAs encoding MPER and FP Ags, employing bioengineering
strategies to enhance Ag exposure and antigenicity. We will clone these DNAs into our expression plasmid and
transform into grEc to make KWC candidate vaccines. Using highly neutralizing and relatively non-neutralizing
MAbs, we will test candidate vaccines, selecting those that show the best difference in binding neutralizing vs.
less neutralizing MAbs for in vivo testing. In Aim 2, we will vaccinate mice to assess vaccine immunogenicity,
comparing the different candidate vaccines, alone and in combination, to identify the best vaccines and
dose/route/adjuvant using ELISAs, ELIspot assays, and PhenoSense neutralization assays against a
representative panel of viruses.
 Decision Gate to progress to Phase 2: Production of a single or combination vaccine that elicits sera in
vaccinated mice yielding an IC50 >100 in the PhenoSense neutralization assay for ≥75% of mice immunized,
for ≥75% of HIV-1 Env reference strains, while sera from control immunized mice (mice immunized with
bacteria not expressing viral antigen) show no neutralization above baseline control.
 In PHASE 2 we will, in Aim 3, conduct a non-human primate (NHP) model study to assess the safety,
immunogenicity, and ability to elicit a neutralizing Ab response by the vaccines. We expect that our vaccines
will induce specific HIV Ag-binding Abs, HIV antigen-specific T cell responses, and BN neutralizing Ab
responses in NHP, implying that the vaccine will be safe and effective in humans. KWC vaccines have a long
history, are inexpensive to make, and can be produced globally in existing facilities, we anticipate that our work
can be quickly translated into safe and effective, inexpensive, globally appropriate, prophylactic HIV vaccines."
10896964,"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended for all people living with HIV (PLWH) – regardless of their CD4
cell count – to improve survival and reduce transmission. This “treat-all” approach benefits PLWH overall, but
also confers a risk of unmasking immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) and death, particularly
for the 30-40% of people who present with advanced HIV disease (CD4 count <200 cells/µL) worldwide.
 In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that persons with advanced HIV disease be
screened for opportunistic infections (OIs) and given prophylaxis for tuberculosis (TB) and cryptococcal antigen
(CrAg). However, because this screening and prophylaxis package has never been validated in a clinical trial,
it is not consistently implemented in sub-Saharan Africa. Compounding the problem, funding for CD4 testing
has been reduced by stakeholders as CD4 testing is no longer needed for ART initiation. Consequently,
identification of persons with advanced HIV disease via CD4 testing and OI screening and prophylaxis often
does not occur in reality. As a result, early mortality after ART initiation remains high.
 Subsequent to the release of the initial 2017 WHO recommendations for OI screening and prophylaxis,
several novel point-of-care diagnostics and treatments for OIs have emerged:
● Visitect point-of-care CD4 assay provides a visual result of CD4 count >200 of <200 cells/µL, with a
 sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 89% in venous blood;
● Semi-quantitative CrAg lateral flow assay (CrAg-SQ LFA) can detect persons with CrAg titers who likely have
 disseminated infection and are at risk of meningitis/death despite standard of care antifungal therapy;
● Fujifilm SILVAMP TB LAM, a new point-of-care TB urinary test, has 70% sensitivity and 91% specificity;
● Isoniazid (INH) + Rifapentine given for one month for latent TB treatment is non-inferior to 9 months of INH.
 The objective of this proposal is to improve survival in persons with advanced HIV disease. We will
implement a 2x2 factorial, cluster-randomized trial in 24 Ugandan clinics to: (Aim 1) determine the survival
benefit of a novel point-of-care CD4 test compared with standard flow cytometry CD4 testing in persons with
advanced HIV disease; and (Aim 2) determine the survival benefit of an enhanced diagnostic OI screening and
prophylaxis strategy in persons with advanced HIV disease. The enhanced OI screening and prophylaxis
strategy will include point-of-care FujiFilm TB LAM, CrAg-SQ LFA, with enhanced prophylaxis for TB (1 month
of INH + rifapentine), and referral of plasma CrAg+ with high titers to hospital. Survival and retention-in-care
will be assessed at 6 months. Lastly, (Aim 3) we will evaluate the cost and cost-effectiveness of the CD4
testing strategies (described in Aim 1) and OI screening and prophylaxis strategies (described in Aim 2).
 Findings from this trial will have the potential to impact international HIV treatment guidelines on optimal
management of persons with advanced HIV disease in order to reduce HIV-related mortality globally."
10842270,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Substance use disorders (SUDs) remain a medical and societal burden with a relative paucity of prevention and
treatment options. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is an essential hub integrating cognitive, contextual, sensory
and affective information into behavioral outcomes. Changes in excitatory (glutamatergic) synaptic function in
the NAc is a leading molecular mechanism by which illicit drug exposure leads to the behavioral manifestations
represented by SUDs. However, a gap in the input specificity, temporal dynamic, mechanism(s) and
consequences of plasticity and drug-induced plasticity onto parvalbumin expressing fast spiking interneurons
(PV-FSIs) remains. The long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms by which NAc circuits mediate
reinforced behaviors. The overall objective of this application is: (1) to define input-specific plasticity mechanisms
controlling excitatory synaptic strength onto PV-FSIs, (2) to elucidate mechanistic contributions of these
synapses to reinforcement behavior, and (3) to determine contribution of NAc PV-FSI AMPA receptors to
cocaine-evoked plasticity of MSN excitatory synapses. The central hypothesis is that functionally-distinct
corticolimbic and thalamic synapses onto PV-FSIs in the NAc support cocaine-evoked adaptations in
reinforcement behavior and circuit function. Aim 1 is designed to determine mechanisms of stimulus and
cocaine-evoked synaptic plasticity of specific excitatory inputs onto NAc PV-FSIs. Aim 2 will determine the role
of glutamatergic signaling onto NAc PV-FSIs in modulating reinforcement behavior in an input specific manner.
And, Aim 3 will elucidate the contribution of NAc PV-FSI AMPA receptors to cocaine-induced plasticity of MSNs.
The rationale for the proposed studies is that they will provide a detailed understanding of the functional
organization of NAc PV-FSI microcircuitry, revealing synaptic mechanisms by which PV-FSIs adapt to stimuli
and support reinforcement behavior as well as influence cocaine-evoked reorganization of output circuits. To
accomplish these aims a combination of whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology, Drugs Acutely Restricted by
Tethering (DART) pharmacology, optogenetics, reinforcement behavior and transgenic mice will be used. The
proposed research is innovative because it represents a new and substantive departure from the status quo by
shifting focus to the modulation of PV-FSI feedforward inhibition as a master regulator of NAc function and thus
reward-related behavior. Completion of the work in this proposal will: (1) establish plasticity mechanisms at
specific excitatory inputs onto PV-FSIs. (2) Establish a causal relationship between NAc PV-FSI AMPA receptors
and reinforcement behavior and (3) demonstrate that NAc PV-FSI AMPA receptors are necessary for cocaine-
evoked plasticity of MSN excitatory synapses. Completion of this work is expected to have a positive translational
impact by examining an understudied but integral component of the reward system and will provide a launching
point for the development of novel strategies to prevent and treat Substance Use Disorders."
10867356,"Project Summary
Intracellular bacterial pathogens such as Legionella pneumophila, an important cause of community- and
hospital-acquired pneumonia, are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. As the spread
of broad-spectrum antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens is escalating, discovery of novel innate
immune defense mechanisms may hold the key for future therapeutic approaches to deal with this increasing
threat. Intracellular pathogens deploy virulence factors to disable many immune cell functions. To win this
battle, the host must overcome this subversion, through as yet poorly defined mechanisms. To address this
critical gap in knowledge, we seek to define the parameters of successful innate immune clearance of
Legionella. Legionella replicates within alveolar macrophages by using its type IV secretion system to deliver
bacterial effectors, several of which inhibit host protein synthesis. Several effectors inhibit host protein
synthesis. Despite this block in host translation, Legionella infection paradoxically enhances production of
inflammatory cytokines. In the previous funding period, we demonstrated that Legionella-infected alveolar
macrophages are able to synthesize and release IL-1; moreover, IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling was required
for robust production of TNF and IL-12 by bystander myeloid cells. Intriguingly, our newly published study show
for the first time that IL-1R signaling in alveolar epithelial cells induces production of granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which was required for bystander cytokine production and bacterial
clearance. Intriguingly, while GM-CSF acts as a potent inflammatory cytokine in host defense against a broad
spectrum of pathogens, our findings show for the first time that GM-CSF metabolically reprograms monocytes
to undergo aerobic glycolysis, thereby promoting cytokine production. We will test the hypothesis that alveolar
epithelium-derived GM-CSF metabolically reprograms monocytes to amplify epigenetic changes that enhance
TLR-driven cytokine production and control of infection. In this renewal, we propose three Aims to first: define
which cell types produce and respond to GM-CSF, second: understand the role of GM-CSF-mediated
metabolic reprogramming in host defense, and third: define how GM-CSF and TLR signaling collaborate to
promote cytokine production. Together, these studies will define novel innate immune mechanisms employed
by the host to surmount pathogen-encoded virulence activities. The proposed research will therefore provide
vital insight into mechanisms of host defense that are utilized against broad classes of microbial pathogens
and aid development of improved anti-microbial therapeutics and vaccines."

One in six adults in the U.S. suffers from chronic and often disabling symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome
(IBS). Intestinal infections are an established risk-factor for development of post-infection IBS (PI-IBS). The
intestinal tract contains a variety of proteases, and we have discovered that PI-IBS patients have significantly
higher fecal proteolytic activity (PA) than controls. More importantly, PA associates strongly with loss of
intestinal barrier function and worse symptoms for the patients. We found that patients who develop PI-IBS and
have high PA have a significant loss of microbial diversity that starts soon after the infection. Key microbial
taxa are lost, especially from the Alistipes genus. Using metaproteomics, we found that proteases driving PA in
these patients are of human origin. In order to understand if loss of microbiota could be affecting host
proteases, we used germ-free mice. Colonization of germ-free mice with healthy human microbiota
(humanization) results in a significant decline of PA suggesting commensal microbes inhibit host proteases
and thus have a role in maintaining intestinal health. However, the dysbiotic microbiota from the high PA
patients that are missing specific microbes were unable to suppress PA. We hypothesize that Alistipes and
other missing bacteria play a critical role in suppression of PA. We plan to test the candidate bacteria identified
in the preliminary experiments and inter-species interactions in PA regulation in Aim 1. Next, we determined
how loss of microbes result in poor inhibition of proteases. Unconjugated bilirubin is an inhibitor of serine
proteases and microbial β-glucuronidases deconjugate bilirubin. We found that the PI-IBS patients with high
PA have lower fecal microbial β-glucuronidase enzymatic activity. Additionally, they have lower levels of end
products of bilirubin deconjugation. β-glucuronidases are a large family of microbial enzymes with varying
sources, structures and catalytic efficacies for different substrates. We hypothesize that loss of specific
microbial β-glucuronidases will result in impaired deconjugation of bilirubin. In Aim 2, we will analyze
metagenomics data from our PI-IBS patients with high and low PA for presence of microbial β-glucuronidases
as well as determine the efficacy of these fecal samples for bilirubin deconjugation. Additionally, we will
generate purified β-glucuronidases from Alistipes and other bacterial taxa for assessing bilirubin deconjugation
efficacy in vitro. Next, we have shown that fecal microbiota transfer using an Alistipes enriched low PA
community can suppress PA in high PA humanized mice providing a rationale for using microbiota for protease
suppression and correcting intestinal barrier function. In Aim 3, we will use cohousing strategies to allow
microbiota transfer between humanized high and low PA mice and determine if barrier dysfunction associated
with a high PA state can be reversed. Furthermore, we will determine changes in barrier pathways, ionic
selectivity and expression of tight junction proteins upon engraftment of new microbiota. Together, these aims
will examine microbial influence on PI-IBS pathophysiology via regulation of intestinal proteases. Identification
of microbiota-based strategies that can result in protease inhibition and restoration of barrier function can be
beneficial for IBS and other conditions associated with microbial dysbiosis."

[This resubmitted project carries on the study of how auditory space is encoded in the barn owl's brain, with
the overarching goal of understanding the interplay between midbrain and forebrain neural populations
underlying discriminability and stimulus selection through auditory space. Behavioral spatial discrimination
assays will be used to test the hypothesis that spatial discriminability is optimized by a built-in representation of
natural cue statistics and in vivo recordings through multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) will be conducted in both
anesthetized and awake barn owls for investigating activity patterns of midbrain neural populations underlying
this effect (Aim 1). Population recordings in the midbrain space map, the hub of the midbrain stimulus selection
network, will be used to investigate the interplay of stimulus temporal dynamics and brain oscillations in the
coding of salient sounds across space (Aim 2). Simultaneous population recordings over brain regions will be
used to investigate the routing of neural activity between midbrain and forebrain underlying sound localization
(Aim 3). Recent findings by our group indicating commonalities of coding schemes across birds and mammals,
including humans, support the premise that investigating mechanisms underlying discriminability, stimulus
selection across space, and population-level midbrain and forebrain routing of activity, important open
questions in sound localization, will be of significance across species. The group has recently developed
multiunit recordings in awake animals, which will be used towards every specific aim.]
Towards Aim 1, we will investigate the relationship between spatial discriminability and a representation of
natural statistics of spatial cues, focusing on interaural time difference (ITD), a critical binaural cue for
determining the azimuth location of sounds across species. This aim will test a hypothesis, based on premises
supported by previous work from our group, that a built-in representation of natural ITD statistics, determined
by the acoustical properties of the head, exists in the brain and optimizes sound localization. Behavioral
studies will be conducted to assess spatial discriminability across frequency and space. MEAs will be used to
record activity of the midbrain map of auditory space and use decoding analyses to investigate properties of
population responses supporting the optimized discriminability pattern. [Recordings in awake birds will be used
as a control for the effect of anesthesia. Preliminary data show feasibility of recordings in awake animals and a
pattern of ITD discriminability across frequency and locations consistent with the hypothesis and properties of
midbrain population responses supporting feasibility of this approach.]
In Aim 2 we will scrutinize the midbrain stimulus selection network of barn owls on a population scale. Previous
work suggested a role of gamma oscillations in stimulus selection and recent studies by our group showed a
dependence between stimulus driven temporal spiking patterns and the location of sound sources relative to
the preferred direction of space specific neurons of the owl’s midbrain. Based on this evidence, we will address
the unexplored question of the interplay of brain oscillations and stimulus driven modulation of temporal spiking
patterns in stimulus selection across space, a critical function of the sound localization system for detecting
sounds based on their salience and location. [Population recordings in anesthetized and awake animals will be
used to simultaneously track the power of brain oscillations across different frequency bands as well as
envelope driven spiking patterns under competing sound stimulation. Preliminary data from MEA recordings
across the midbrain space map show changes in population responses to competing sounds supporting the
feasibility of the approach, and correlation between power of gamma oscillations and stimulus-driven temporal
spiking patterning across the population consistent with an interplay of these signals in coding the salience of a
sound. Preliminary data of recordings in awake barn owls show increased power of gamma range brain
oscillations and correlation with response levels, corresponding with results obtained in anesthetized animals.]
A critical open question in sound localization is the interplay of midbrain and forebrain areas displaying
seemingly different coding schemes of sound localization, which we will address in Aim 3. [We will conduct
simultaneous population recordings across brain regions in anesthetized and awake birds to elucidate the
routing of neural activity across areas by analyzing pairwise correlation structure and trial-to-trial variability.]
Previous studies by our group have shown important differences in correlation structure between midbrain and
forebrain regions involved in sound localization, supporting the potential significance of investigating the bases
of those results in simultaneous recordings of these brain areas and feasibility of this unprecedented approach.
Thus, this project will assess the higher-order dynamics and interplay of midbrain and forebrain neural
populations involved in sound localization to investigate mechanisms underlying vital functions that operate
across species. [A new approach of in vivo recording in awake barn owls was recently developed by the group
to validate functional significance of results across aims.] The contribution of this research to understanding
central auditory processing underlying sound localization will lead to more accurate interpretations of auditory
perception and its disruption in hearing disorders, with potential for improving treatments."
10892224,"Summary
HIV-infected microglia release cytokines, chemokines and viral gene products, such as gp120 and tat, that
are toxic to neurons. In this proposal, we will use human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to generate
cortical and dopaminergic neurons as well as microglia, which will be cultured as organoids to model HIV-drug
abuse interactions in conjunction with in-depth genomic approaches and electrophysiology. We show
electrophysiological results that demonstrate that the levels of differentiation of the neurons in our organoids
are comparable to in vivo and ex vivo preparations and are among the best that can be found in the scientific
literature. To identify candidate host regulators of HIV expression and mediators of HIV-induced tissue damage
and disease progression, we will expose microglia-containing cerebral organoids to methamphetamine
(METH), a stimulant, and morphine, an opiate, which are members of two of the classes of drugs of abuse that
are more prevalent among People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). Cerebral organoids will be exposed to toxic
HIV products such as Tat, gp120, drugs of abuse and combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). In some
experiments we will also incorporate iPSC-derived astrocytes into microglia-containing cerebral organoids to
test the role of astrocytes in neuroprotection and neurodegeneration. We will carry out single-cell gene
expression profiling of iPSC-derived organoids exposed to drugs of abuse, HIV products, and cART and we
will employ an advanced systems biology strategy to generate testable mechanistic hypotheses on the
pathogenesis of neurodegeneration and tissue damage in neuroHIV (Aim 1) and identify candidate regulators
of the LTR promoter that may shed light on the regulation of latency and reactivation of the HIV provirus (Aim
2). In preliminary studies, this computational experimental approach allowed us to identify candidate drivers of
gene expression changes associated with neuroHIV and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s
disease and drug and alcohol abuse. These findings support the overarching hypothesis that dissection of the
gene regulatory network of the central nervous system will pave the way for the identification of novel
mechanistic hypotheses and druggable targets to improve neuropsychological functioning of PLWHA and
substance abuse comorbidity."
10894909,"Social withdrawal is a transdiagnostic phenotype that is strongly associated with detrimental physical and
mental health outcomes across the lifespan. As quantified using structural features of individuals’ social
networks, social withdrawal is associated with 60-70% increased mortality and a threefold increase in suicide
risk. Recent findings document associations between trauma-related psychopathology and altered social
network structural features, including size, density, diversity, and embeddedness. Critically, because the
transition to adulthood (age 16-20) is a period of rapid expansion in social networks, forms of psychopathology
that produce social withdrawal may confer particular risk for poor outcomes during this developmental stage.
Thus, the transition to adulthood is a key developmental period for the evolution of social withdrawal in trauma-
exposed populations. Recent literature indicates that social reward processing may drive social network size
and complexity, but the role of disrupted social reward functioning in driving progressive social withdrawal
following trauma exposure is poorly understood. Using an innovative longitudinal design including digital
phenotyping of social behavior, the proposed study will investigate activity and connectivity within brain regions
that bidirectionally code for social approach and avoidance, including the basolateral amygdala (BLA),
ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), and nucleus accumbens (NAcc). The hypothesis is that BLA-VMPFC-
NAcc functional connectivity will prospectively predict progressive social withdrawal during the transition to
adulthood following interpersonal trauma exposure. We will enroll 120 trauma-exposed participants (ages 16-
20) who endorse posttraumatic and/or depressive symptoms, and 60 healthy controls. Trauma-exposed
participants will be stratified for baseline self-reported social anhedonia. We obtain baseline social withdrawal
measures, including active self-reports of social interaction and passive smartphone based phenotyping of
activity via accelerometer, GPS, and call/text metadata. Participants will complete an fMRI scan to obtain
measures of BLA-VMPFC-NAcc connectivity, followed by one year of digital phenotyping using active and
passive data to measure social withdrawal. Based on our extensive preliminary data, we hypothesize that: 1)
baseline social withdrawal will be associated with baseline BLA-VMPFC-NAcc connectivity; (2) baseline BLA-
VMPFC-NAcc connectivity will prospectively predict progressive social withdrawal over the course of a 12-
month follow-up; (3) predictive models of social withdrawal that include BLA-VMPFC-NAcc connectivity will
outperform alternate models. The proposed integrated approach (fMRI, digital phenotyping)
will identify specific
circuitry associated with progressive social withdrawal during the transition to adulthood, and will develop
predictive algorithms that forecast social withdrawal trajectories based on baseline connectivity within BLA-
VMPFC-NAcc circuitry. Ultimately this work could lead to the development of targeted interventions (e.g.
neurofeedback), and may shift the field toward reward-circuitry accounts of social withdrawal."
10874473,"ABSTRACT
The incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cancers all dramatically increase as
a function of age. The underlying mechanisms of these diseases, which vary, are incompletely understood.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many SNPs that are associated with these conditions.
One of the strongest associations comes from the CDKN2A/B locus on chromosome 9p21.3 which has been
associated with multiple age-related diseases, as well as overall human lifespan. Within this 200 kb locus, there
are three encoded proteins, p16INK4a, p14ARF and p15INK4b, and one antisense non-coding RNA, the inhibitor of
CDK4 (INK4) locus (AS/ANRIL). To date, it has not been firmly established which, if any, of these genes are the
risk genes for the associated diseases. There are ~193 disease-associated, noncoding SNPs in linkage
disequilibrium (LDs) across this 200 kb region, represented by 18 lead SNPs used for GWAS analysis. While
the mechanisms underlying the contribution of these SNPs to specific diseases are not fully understood, a single
genetic region associated with multiple different age-related diseases suggests that this locus may modulate
these conditions by promoting aging itself, perhaps via induction of cellular senescence as a common
mechanism. In this application, we propose to apply an experimental approach using high throughput techniques
we have recently developed including Reel-seq and FREP/SDCP-MS, to systematically dissect this locus. We
will first identify the disease-associated functional SNPs (fSNPs), as well as the regulatory elements across the
58 kb core region primarily associated with cardiovascular diseases using Reel-seq. Next, we will identify the
regulatory proteins that specifically bind to all the fSNPs, as well as the regulatory elements, using FREP/SDCP-
MS. A range of relevant cell types related to atherosclerosis will be used to generate the nuclear extract required
for our screens. We will demonstrate the role of these regulatory proteins by confirming their direct effects on
p16INK4a, p14ARF, p15INK4b and AS/ANRIL expression, and subsequently on cell cycle regulation and cellular
senescence. A range of complementary techniques such as RNAi, CRISPR/cas9 gene editing, will be employed.
Such analysis will provide the first in-depth understanding of this critical genomic region, as well as a unique
strategy to uncover unifying biochemical pathways that simultaneously regulate atherosclerosis, as well as
potentially multiple other age-related diseases."
10864051,"Retraining Neural Pathways Improves Cognitive Skills After A Mild Traumatic Brain Injury
This study seeks to address the challenge of how to deliver targeted interventions that address individualized
cognitive needs of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) patients. mTBIs are prevalent, with over 2.5 million
concussions occurring in the U.S. each year with only 1 in 6 of these concussions being diagnosed. mTBIs
represent 80% of TBIs. The bulk of mTBIs result from motor vehicle accidents, falls, and situations involving
sudden acceleration and/or deceleration of the head, such as sports injuries. A mTBI can result in substantial
cognitive impairments, with an inability to return to work or school, and low levels of satisfaction with one’s
quality of life. Currently, there are no proven solutions to remediate cognitive deficits prevalent in those with a
mTBI. Visual timing deficits are persistent in individuals with a mild TBI (mTBI), and are thought to be due to
processing deficits in the dorsal pathways, and attention and executive control networks. The premise of the
current proposal is rehabilitative treatments for those with a mTBI fall short because these timing issues are
not being addressed. To address these limitations, we developed a movement-discrimination intervention
(PATH training) that is designed to stimulate dorsal motion pathways. PATH is hypothesized to improve the
precision in timing of visual events, and in turn improve cognitive functions that rely upon visual timing, such as
working memory span, a function that is commonly impaired in mTBI patients. This study will provide clinical
testing of therapeutic training for the treatment of cognitive disorders caused by a mTBI. We will extend
previous results from a pilot study of four mTBI subjects to a much larger sample of mTBI subjects. We will
determine the feasibility of an intervention that remediates visual timing deficits to improve visual and cognitive
deficits in mTBI more than a Sham or a conventional working memory training task. The proposed study tests
the ability of PATH neurotraining to improve visual working memory, and processing speed (primary outcomes)
and auditory working memory (WM), selective attention, cognitive flexibility, sustained attention, reading speed,
and reading proficiency (secondary outcomes) in mTBI subjects rapidly and effectively. We predict that PATH
training is more effective than either conventional WM training or Sham training. These predictions will be
evaluated by both percentile scores on neuropsychological tests of cognitive function, scores on reading
speed, reading proficiency, MoCA screening test, and questionnaires, and Magnetoencephalography (MEG)
brain recordings for a subset of subjects in treatment groups, providing a biomarker, as is required for
commercialization. MEG brain recordings will be used to determine whether PATH neurotraining improves the
function of the visual motion, attention, and working memory networks more than found after N-Back WM
training. MEG recordings will also be used to determine whether PATH neurotraining strengthens coupled: 1)
theta/gamma activity, and 2) alpha/ gamma activity. There is a need to provide a proven solution for a mTBI
by developing, and marketing a rapid and effective treatment shown in clinical trials to improve cognitive skills."

Increasing underrepresented minority (URM) participation in the biomedical workforce is essential to ensuring
scientific diversity and meeting the growing demand for STEM graduates. Inadequate URM representation in
STEM has historically been fueled by lack of access to professional resources and educational opportunities,
leading to low rates of retention of URMs in STEM degree fields. Theoretically-grounded, mentored research
experiences have been shown to address these barriers and increase URM persistence in STEM fields.
However, few structured, comprehensively evaluated programs exist and most focus on undergraduate and
post-baccalaureate students, as opposed to the critical foundational period of high school. Thus, the primary
objective of the proposed mentored research program, titled MUSC High School Teen Science Ambassador
Program, is to provide early clinical research experiences and professional development to high school
students with the long-term goal of increasing diversity and helping meet the growing need in the biomedical
workforce. The program will be supported by MUSC’s Youth Collaborative, which is comprised of faculty and
trainees focused on adolescent substance use and mental health research, which will provide a rich training
ground for real-world research experiences. The proposed program is aligned with NIH’s mission to support
educational activities that complement and enhance the training of a workforce to meet the nation’s biomedical,
behavioral, and clinical research needs as outlined in PAR-20-153. The specific aims of the Teen Science
Ambassador Program are to: provide courses for skills development and hands-on research experiences, as
well as mentoring and professional development training to youth interested in STEM careers. This will be
accomplished through three focused phases: (1) a 16-week, mentored didactic training on clinical research
skills and professional development, including completion of a literature review, oral presentation, and public
service announcement; (2) near-peer mentorship training and experience, as well as an internship in an NIH-
funded lab focused on adolescent substance use research; and (3) continued networking with peers, faculty,
and alumni for long-term career success. Input from community stakeholders and an Advisory Committee will
be collected to assess and improve program goals and outcomes, and all program materials will be made
publicly available for dissemination and implementation at other institutions. The highly-qualified,
multidisciplinary faculty mentorship team, partnerships with community schools and leaders, and rigorous
program evaluation from independent evaluators will ensure that the proposed program meets the stated
objective to increase diversity in the biomedical workforce."
10897339,"Lung and colorectal cancer are among the top three most deadly malignancies and together they account for
~32% of all cancer-related fatalities. Although anti-cancer immunotherapy using PD-1 and CTLA-4 blocking
antibodies shows prominent activity and has been approved for use in multiple tumors, most patients show
treatment resistance and there are striking differences in the clinical activity across tumor types. Currently, the
determinants for treatment sensitivity/resistance and the difference in the role of dominant immune evasion
pathways across cancers are uncertain. To substantially reduce lung and colorectal cancer mortality, it is
imperative to: i) Identify novel biomarkers for optimal selection of patients for treatment; ii) Uncover
immunotherapy targets beyond the PD-1/CTLA-4 pathways that may serve to treat patients with refractory
tumors; and iii) Reveal the role of immunity during tumor progression to design early therapeutic interventions.
Recent studies from our group identified the IL-8/CXCR1/CXCR2 pathway as a strong determinant for negative
immune modulation and therapeutic resistance to immune checkpoint blockers. The immune suppressive
effects of the IL-8 pathway involve increased neutrophils in the tumor niche and local development of
neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). We hypothesize that the deleterious effects of the IL-8 pathway in the
tumor immune microenvironment are promoted by local metabolic suppression. We anticipate these responses
to be different in tumors with distinct immune properties and sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockers such as
lung and colorectal cancer; and during early stages of tumor development. In this project and through 3
complementary aims, we will leverage our expertise in cancer immunobiology and translational research to: i)
Determine the metabolic/immune context and biomarker value of the IL-8 pathway and myeloid-cell responses
in cancer; ii) Analyze the mechanisms and role of IL-8 induced NET formation as negative immunomodulatory
event in human malignancies; and iii) Examine the role of the IL-8 pathway and immune contexture in
carcinogenesis and early cancer progression. The results from this work will accelerate translation of research
concepts into the clinic for establishment of novel biomarkers, support interpretation of clinical trials and design
optimal treatment modalities for early-stage and advanced tumors."
10903778,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Corneal neovascularization (CNV), or the invasion of new blood vessels into the avascular cornea, remains
one of the major causes of blindness worldwide. Topical eye drop therapy serves as the most easily accessible
and noninvasive treatment of CNV, but its therapeutic efficacy is limited due to the corneal barriers and
nasolacrimal drainage that quickly eliminates eye drops within a few minutes. Recent advances of biodegradable
microneedles have led to the development of many strategies for intraocular drug delivery through the corneal
barriers, which increases therapeutic efficacy. However, the clinical implementation of these microneedles in
human eyes is often impeded due to their relatively large size for the human cornea and rapidly dissolving nature
(typically, within 15 minutes-2 hours), which causes pain and limited therapeutic efficacy, respectively. The
research endeavors of this project will focus on the development of a new class of intraocular drug delivery
platform made from fully-miniaturized (i.e., at nanoscale) and slowly-biodegradable silicon nanoneedles that are
> 30-fold smaller and provide > 10-fold slower degradation rate compared to current biodegradable
microneedles. The silicon nanoneedles will be built upon a water-soluble contact lens that offers excellent
biocompatibility, softness, rapid degradability in tear fluid (within no more than 30 seconds), and optimal
curvature to fit a variety of corneal shapes (8.3-9.0 mm base curve radii). These aspects are essential to allow
for the minimally-invasive, painless, and long-term (over days) sustained delivery of ocular drugs through the
corneal barriers. In this project, we will reveal the structure-property-performance relationship of the silicon
nanoneedles with various size, shape, aspect ratio, and surface porosity in vitro and ex vivo. We will also
evaluate the biosafety, therapeutic efficacy, and side-effects of the silicon nanoneedles in a well-established
rabbit CNV model in vivo, as compared to conventional anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy (anti-
VEGF) and laser therapy. Because the materials used for both the nanoneedles and water-soluble contact lens
are already in clinical use, this intraocular drug delivery platform can be rapidly translated into clinical practice
for the treatment of CNV in human eyes. Furthermore, the established intraocular drug delivery platform will be
also useful for the treatment of other chronic ocular diseases, including corneal, retinal, and choroidal
neovascularization."
10893411,"Project Abstract
Exposure to environmental chemical mixtures may increase the risk of cardiometabolic disease. Of particular
concern are prenatal exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a class of chemicals used as processing
aids for oil/water repellant textiles, fluoropolymer manufacturing, food packaging, cleaning products, and
firefighting foams. PFAS exposure is ubiquitous, deriving from contaminated food and drinking water. Over 6
million people in the US have PFAS contaminated drinking water, and many more have low-level exposure.
Animal and human studies show that prenatal PFAS exposure may increase the risk of obesity, insulin
resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension – components of the cardiometabolic syndrome that markedly
increase the risk of adulthood cardiovascular diseases. However, few studies have investigated the health
effects of PFAS mixtures, and the biological pathways underlying these effects are poorly understood. Guided
by our preliminary studies and the hypothesis that biological pathways represented in the serum metabolome
are sensitive to early life PFAS mixture exposure and predictive of later life cardiometabolic health, we will use
non-targeted high-resolution metabolomics to quantify the associations between prenatal PFAS mixtures, the
metabolome, and cardiometabolic disease. Building upon two established and ongoing prospective cohorts of
pregnant women and their children from Canada (MIREC Study, n=500) and Cincinnati, Ohio (HOME Study,
n=250), we will measure >25,000 features of the serum metabolome at delivery and ages 3-5, and 7-12 years.
We will link these data to previously collected or to be measured prenatal PFAS biomarkers and
cardiometabolic outcomes at age 7-12 years. We will use sophisticated biostatistical techniques to reduce the
dimensionality of these data and discover metabolomic signatures associated with both prenatal PFAS
mixtures and cardiometabolic outcomes in MIREC, replicating our findings using HOME. Specifically, we will:
1) characterize trajectories of the serum metabolome in the first 12 years of life; 2) identify features of serum
metabolome trajectories in the first 12 years of life that predict adolescent cardiometabolic disease; 3)
determine if metabolome features mediate the association of prenatal exposure to PFAS mixtures with
adolescent cardiometabolic disease; and 4) determine the chemical identity of metabolome features
discovered in Aim 3. This interdisciplinary proposal that includes epidemiologists, clinicians, biostatisticians,
and chemists will efficiently leverage two ongoing cohort studies to address these timely aims. Ultimately, the
proposed studies will have substantial impact by improving our knowledge of the health effects of PFAS,
identifying novel metabolic alterations associated with PFAS mixtures and adolescent health, and improving
our understanding of biological pathways affecting cardiometabolic disease. These results are critical to
ongoing evaluations of PFAS toxicity and may help identify exposed populations at risk of cardiometabolic
disease and potentially ameliorate the effects of PFAS exposure."
10671546,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Autism Spectrum Disorders (autism) has significant and long term effects on the lives of children and their
families. Reliable diagnosis of autism is not possible until 2 years of age or later, and there are no currently
available methods to screen for autism in early infancy. Preliminary evidence suggests that children with
autism may be characterized by atypical features of cry and neurobehavior during early infancy. Previous
research has identified atypicalities in vocal production in older children with autism, and unusual acoustic
features of infant cry would be consistent with such findings from early childhood. One barrier to the acoustic
analysis of newborn cry has been the lack of a computerized cry analysis system based on modern
technology. Our lab has developed a new cry analysis system based on state-of-the-art signal processing that
can be used to study acoustic characteristics of cry that could relate to risk for autism. Our group has also
developed the NNNS, a widely used and well validated neurobehavioral exam for infants in the newborn
period. Preliminary findings point to a set of cry and neurobehavioral features from these measures that was
able to differentiate a sample of infants later diagnosed with autism from non-autistic infants included in a
longitudinal, heterogeneous, child development study. Other preliminary findings support the hypothesis that
infant cry and neurobehavior are affected in infants with later autism diagnoses. In the proposed project, we
will utilize cry and neurobehavioral assessments that are being collected as part of unique pregnancy and birth
cohort at a large regional hospital. It is anticipated that up to up to 5,000 infants will be enrolled and followed
longitudinally. A 2-stage screening and evaluation process will identify children with autism by 24 to 36 months
of age. Ongoing analyses will be conducted to identify neonatal cry and neurobehavioral characteristics that
are associated with risk for autism using signal detection methods and complex conditional statistical models.
This project is of high significance and has the potential to have substantial impact on public health by
identifying potential indicators of risk for autism. The long term impact of this research would be on the
development of early screening and early interventions for infants at risk for autism."
10911891,"The Georgetown University “Aging and Alzheimer’s Research Training” (AART) program is designed for
predoctoral students and postdoctoral fellows whose backgrounds have not included substantial previous
training in aging or Alzheimer’s disease. It is driven by a transdisciplinary group of researchers across
biomedical topics that are associated with cognitive impairment with aging (e.g., diabetes, HIV-infection,
traumatic brain injury, proteinopathies, chemotherapy, seizures). The AART program will direct aspects of
these research disciplines more directly to aging and AD research through the trainees. Participating faculty
have the dedicated time and the University support to allow the AART program to thrive. Beyond this research,
there are ten general areas of required training: 1) Clinical exposures in the Memory Disorders Program and in
brain cuttings; 2) Coursework in areas of Biostatistics, Aging, and Neurodegeneration; 3) Structured personal
interactions each semester with researchers from Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers; 4) Intensive grant
writing for current research projects and nascent careers; 5) Attendance and presentations at national
meetings; 6) A new Georgetown symposium on Aging and Alzheimer’s disease; 7) Cohort writing of a review
paper on an interdisciplinary research topic; 8) Regular training the Responsible Conduct of Research as well
as Rigor and Reproducibility; 9) Roundtables to promote thoughtful consideration of training experiences,
including research; and 10) Outreach experiences for public education and social good. As developed, several
of these required activities are specific to the AART cohorts (e.g., personal interactions with national research
leaders, instruction in writing of a publishable literature review, data presentations), and several more would
positively impact the broader Washington, DC research community (the yearly Aging and AD symposium;
research interactions with regional Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers). Other activities ensure that
trainees benefit from current University resources (journal clubs, existing coursework, training in quantitative
and reproducible data analysis). Trainees will work with the Office of Career Strategy and Professional
Development, which will also aid in the recruitment of individuals from under-represented minority groups. The
program is directed by G. William Rebeck, who has contributed research to these areas for nearly 30 years.
Oversight is provided by an Executive Committee, and by Internal and External Advisory Boards. Georgetown
has the advantages of a cohesive set of researchers and strong financial support from the University.
Furthermore, there are resources in the Washington DC area that are unique for better training, including
researchers at the NIH/NIA, Howard University programs, and federal interactions. The goal of the AART is to
take strong existing research programs at Georgetown related to conditions of aging, and use them to train
students and fellows more intentionally in topics of aging and AD. This program will also drive these research
labs to produce impactful aging and AD research."

Eukaryotic cells organize their interior into a set of membrane-­enclosed compartments, referred to as organelles

Understanding  of  the  spatial  organization  of  human  cells  is  currently  experiencing  a  revolution,  with  the

conserved across taxa. It is poorly understood how the spatial organization of the ER-­Golgi interface is achieved, 
and why this specific organization is required. It is also a mystery how this junction can exhibit structural integrity

Our  goal  is  to  understand  the  mechanisms  that  establish  the  specific  morphology  of  the  ER-­Golgi  interface  in

10869987,"Prematurity is a public health crisis impacting 10% of all births. There is significant risk for neurocognitive
impairment, including language. This can adversely impact quality of life. Current prognostic tools leave a
significant proportion of variance in later language scores unexplained, focus on risk factors which are often not
modifiable, and fail to identify resiliency, or positive outcome despite risk. There is a critical need for advanced
neuroimaging studies of well-performing extremely preterm (EPT, <28 weeks gestation) children at school-age
and beyond to identify brain-based markers of resiliency while explicitly accounting for socioenvironmental
factors. The proposed experiments will address this need by leveraging an existing cohort of 45 EPT children
with no overt brain injury and 45 term comparison children. These EPT children were found to have increased
functional and structural connectivity--including an extracallosal interhemispheric pathway--versus term children,
which positively correlated with language at 4 to 6 years of age for EPT children exclusively. The central
hypothesis is that EPT children performing within normal limits on language tasks do so via adaptive neural
networks--which are extracallosal and bypass areas vulnerable to white matter injury of prematurity--and the
environment in which EPT children are developing drives this adaptive hyperconnectivity. The objective of the
proposed research is to determine if this hyperconnectivity remains a brain-based biomarker of resiliency at 8-
11 years and analyze the influence of the child’s social environment on hyperconnectivity. The first aim is to
determine if the extracallosal hyperconnectivity (versus term children) we observed at 4-6 years of age in the
EPT group persists to 8-11 years of age. The second aim is to determine the extent to which language scores
at 8-11 years relate to hyperconnectivity for EPT children. The third aim is to evaluate the extent to which
environmental factors drive brain connectivity. Children will be assessed longitudinally with
magnetoencephalography, functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and diffusion MRI to validate unique
neuroimaging signatures previously identified. Environment-based factors will be assessed at birth (through
linkage with birth records), 4-6 years, and 8-11 years to evaluate the extent to which they influence preterm brain
connectivity. The candidate’s long-term goal is to reduce the burden of neurodevelopmental impairment for
children born EPT by uncovering adaptive, neuroprotective mechanisms and developing imaging markers that
can subsequently be used to improve prediction of outcomes before language can be reliably assessed. Through
formal coursework, workshops, and hands-on training during the proposed research with her interdisciplinary
committee of expert advisors and mentors, the candidate will gain expertise in epidemiological methods to
evaluate socioenvironmental risk across generations and in the science of adversity and resiliency. This is a
critical next step to establish scientific independence as an investigator and a leader in the study of
socioenvironmental resiliency, language development, and neuroprotective mechanisms in the preterm brain."
10877734,"It is well-recognized that unanticipated respiration-induced motion can result in significant errors in
planned vs delivered dose in thoracic radiotherapy (RT), resulting in local regional failure and/or increased
radiation-induced toxicity. In this proposal, we build upon our previous motion management research and aim
to overcome the limitations of current motion management strategies, which tend to underrepresent both the
extent and the spatiotemporal complexity of respiratory motion. Our overall premise is that, as our field adopts
increasingly more potent forms of RT, real-time single-point monitoring needs to be replaced by real-time
volumetric monitoring to capture complex motion. Recently available integrated magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI)+Linac systems aim to address the limitations of current conventional solutions. However, the high cost
and complexity of these systems, as well as engineering and technological challenges, have proven to be
substantial barriers to their widespread clinical adoption (less than 1% of the total US install base for linacs).
 To address this unmet clinical need, we form an academic-industrial partnership to investigate and
develop a novel in-room real-time motion management solution for lung RT that combines 4DMRI and 4DCT
(4D=3D+time). In Aim 1, we develop and investigate rapid 4DMRI techniques. In Aim 2, we merge the
volumetric motion information derived from 4DMRI and 4DCT to create a patient-specific, multi-cycle motion
model that incorporates the geometric fidelity and electron density information from CT with the soft-tissue
contrast and dose-free, long-term monitoring from MRI. This model is parameterized by the spatial positions of
MRI-compatible electromagnetic (EM) sensors placed on the thoracoabdominal surface of the patient. By
knowing the position of these sensors at any given time point, we can estimate the corresponding position of
each voxel within the irradiated volume. At each treatment fraction, the model is rebuilt using in-room kV
fluoroscopy prior to delivery to account for inter-fraction (day-to-day) changes in external-internal
correspondence and updated using kV fluoro during dose delivery to account for intra-fraction changes. In Aim
3, we develop two identical preclinical prototype systems (EndoScoutRT) and form end-user teams tasked with
formulating clinical workflows, quality assurance guidelines, and strategies for clinical translation. In Aim 4, we
perform end-user evaluation of the prototype systems by conducting a prospective non-interventional clinical
study in 44 lung cancer patients at two institutions. We compare the performance of our model-based motion
management to current standard-of-care and MRI+Linac based real-time motion management. Our team has
extensive expertise in clinical study design, image-guided RT, rapid MRI, and real-time motion management.
We anticipate that the successful clinical translation of this approach (beyond the current scope) will enable
safer administration of highly potent and clinically effective forms of thoracic RT."
11016464,"Project Summary/Abstract
Although cocaine is powerfully rewarding, not all people who are exposed to this drug are equally prone to abusing it.
The reasons for these differences remain unknown but may involve predisposing factors whose elucidation could lead to
therapies that, in the future, may prevent cocaine addiction. One such predisposing factor is behavioral sensitivity to the
aversive attributes of cocaine, which overlap with the rewarding effects to protect against cocaine-seeking. Preliminary
data in this proposal suggest that the aversive effect of cocaine may be much stronger in some individuals than others
and potentially a determinant for cocaine addiction vulnerability. The underlying cellular mechanism of this variability
remains unknown. However, our preliminary data revealed that higher RhoA activity and D2-MSN excitability in the
mNACshell correlate with rats displaying higher aversive effects of cocaine (and consequently lower drive to seek
cocaine). Nevertheless, it is unknown if these cellular and molecular adaptations in the mNACshell are involved in the
aversive attributes of cocaine. Accordingly, to address this gap in knowledge, I’m proposing two aims. In aim 1, I will
determine the roles of D2MSN on cocaine avoidance behavior, and for this, I will be trained in fiber photometric and
optogenetic methods. I hypothesize that D2- but not D1-MSNs are activated during cocaine’s aversive phase, and that D2
activity in turn drives conditioned negative attributes of cocaine. In aim 2, I will examine the roles of RhoA and related
genes on neural excitability and cocaine avoidance in a cell-specific manner. First, I will use mRNA TRAP methods to
analyze cell-specific gene translation associated with RhoA signaling or excitability linked to cocaine avoidance
phenotypes. In addition, to test the causal role of RhoA in excitability and cocaine avoidance behavior, I will decrease or
increase RhoA activity in a cell-specific manner using an adeno-associated gene manipulation strategy. I hypothesize
that increases in RhoA activity in D2-MSN but not D1-MSN enhances excitability in the mNACshell confer protection
against the acquisition of cocaine-seeking. An intense and comprehensive training, mentoring, and research plan has
been developed to achieve these goals. This plan will be guided by a powerful team of mentors and collaborators that
will help blend my current skill set with new conceptual and technical frameworks as I continue to establish my own
unique and innovative research program in addiction neuroscience."
10894037,"Using three-dimensional protein networks to uncover immuno-modulatory molecular phenotypes in
 infectious disease
CHALLENGE: Over the past decade, technologies for deep profiling of the human immune system, both in
the context of natural and vaccine-mediated immunity, have become readily available. These approaches
have generated a wide range of molecular profiles across infectious disease contexts. However, existing
studies primarily focus on individual `omic datasets, and do not take into account the underlying molecular
networks. Thus, the primary emphasis has been on uncovering predictive biomarkers, but these biomarkers
may often be correlative surrogates and have little or no connection with the underlying molecular phenotypes
driving disease pathophysiology.
GOAL I propose to develop and use a novel framework to integrate genomic data with three-dimensional (3D)
structurally-resolved protein networks to uncover immuno-modulatory molecular phenotypes in infectious
disease. While protein networks are typically viewed as two-dimensional, with proteins as nodes and
interactions between them as edges, this simplifying representation fails to take into account the 3D structures
of the proteins themselves, and the corresponding interaction interfaces. My past work has demonstrated the
critical importance of taking into account corresponding structural information in the integration of Mendelian
mutations with protein networks, to elucidate molecular phenotypes underlying the corresponding genetic
disorders, with high sensitivity and specificity. Here, I propose to develop a novel framework that integrates
structural genomic data with host-pathogen protein interactome networks to generate 3D host-pathogen
interactomes. These 3D interactome networks are then integrated with host (human) genetic data to uncover
immuno-modulatory molecular phenotypes in HIV and influenza.
INNOVATION AND IMPACT: The proposed work integrates both two orthogonal facets of my expertise in
network systems biology and machine learning, and pushes the envelope on multiple key frontiers. First, it
provides a novel framework for the integration of host genetic data with host-pathogen protein networks.
Second, a key novelty is the incorporation of structural information corresponding to host-pathogen protein
interaction interfaces to refine the traditional principle of “guilt-by-association”, and hone in on specific
molecular phenotypes that modulate infectious disease risk. The identified molecular phenotypes will generate
key mechanistic hypotheses regarding corresponding disease pathophysiology, and help design
interventional strategies. Finally, while the focus here is to use this approach in HIV and influenza, the
framework itself is generalizable and can be used across infectious disease contexts."
10866525,"Summary/Abstract
The immunologically inactive (cold) tumor is a major challenge for effective immunotherapies in many cancers,
including breast cancer. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that human cells express various types of
endogenous double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) regardless of pathogen invasion, and aberrant accumulation of
cellular dsRNAs could trigger a detrimental innate immune response in cells. In cancer, these endogenous
immunogenic dsRNAs are suggested as a source of immune induction to increase tumor response to
immunotherapy. However, to exploit the cellular dsRNAs in immunotherapy for cancer, we need to understand
the molecular mechanism for cellular dsRNA homeostasis in normal and malignant cells and find the specific
ways to modulate immunogenic dsRNAs. We found that inhibition of DEAD-box RNA helicase 3X (DDX3X)
resulted in the cytoplasmic accumulation of endogenous dsRNAs in the breast cancer cells. Loss of DDX3X
increased the type I interferon production, STAT1 activation, IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) expression, and the
MHC class I expression with the enhanced antigen presentation on the breast cancer cells. DDX3X inhibition
also suppressed the tumor growth and increased the tumor infiltration of active CD8+ T cells and DC in the
syngeneic breast cancer mouse model. We hypothesize that inhibiting DDX3X leads to aberrant accumulation
of endogenous dsRNAs, which triggers type I IFN responses and induces an innate immune response in the
tumor. The proposed studies will be focused on understanding the molecular mechanism by which DDX3X
regulates cellular dsRNA homeostasis, providing a link between cellular dsRNAs and immune signals in breast
cancer cells, and establishing novel immunotherapeutic strategies for breast cancer. In Aim 1, we will
determine the molecular mechanism by which DDX3X regulates cellular dsRNAs; In Aim 2, we will study
DDX3X-dsRNAs-Type I IFN axis in cancer cells and human tumor; In Aim 3, we will explore the effect of
inhibiting DDX3X to increase anti-tumor immunity and sensitize tumors to immunotherapy. Our study will reveal
a novel regulatory mechanism of endogenous dsRNAs in cancer and may lead to novel therapeutics targeting
DDX3X for new combinatory immunotherapy."

Health and Social Science
The goal of this first T32, 5-year renewal of the successful “Transdisciplinary Training at the
Intersection of Environmental Health and Social Science” is to prepare 10 doctoral students and
8 postdocs (3 environmental health and 3 social science) to be future leaders in social science-
environmental health science collaborations. This overall goal has the following objectives:
1) Educate trainees in a new research trajectory that combines environmental health and social
science; 2) Teach trainees about community-based participatory research (CBPR),
environmental justice, informal science education, and public participation in research; 3) Train
researchers to integrate CBPR practices into existing and emerging research programs; 4)
Provide hands-on training at a science-based CBO to demonstrate to trainees how it does
research and interfaces with advocacy on emerging contaminants and technologies. This
training program is unique in that is co-directed by an academic institution - Northeastern
University's Social Science Environmental Health Research Institute and a non-academic
institution - Silent Spring Institute, a science-based/community-based participatory research
environmental non-profit organization. It builds upon 15 years of collaborative research and
training activities between the two partners. Trainees are equipped to improve environmental
health, particularly among underserved populations, through: core and elective coursework, two
dedicated seminar series for trainees, engagement with CBOs that use novel tools for robust
exposure and dose estimates, participatory research methods such as community-based
participatory research and civic science, an overarching environmental justice approach, and
reflexive research ethics. Trainees will be part of research teams at both institutions, including
processes and ethics of reporting back biomonitoring and personal exposure results to
participants; data sharing and privacy protection; exposure, remediation, health effects, and
regulatory and policy issues of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, modeling of emerging
contaminants in Cape Cod drinking water, water access and equity; development of exposure
biomarkers for breast cancer studies; and development and application of low-cost community
sensors. Trainees will also learn how to work with the news media. Pre-doctoral trainees will be
funded for 3 years each, and the postdoctoral trainees will be funded for 2 years each."
10897949,"Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by protein aggregation and
cognitive decline. Patients with Alzheimer’s disease experience neuropsychiatric symptoms including
hallucinations and delusions, which are also characteristic of schizophrenia. Evidence suggests that female
patients with Alzheimer’s disease have a more insidious onset of illness, and many have more
neuropsychiatric diagnoses. We recently discovered that protein insolubility is increased in a subset of
postmortem brains from patients with schizophrenia. While schizophrenia is not a neurodegenerative disorder,
and does not exhibit widespread neuronal loss, our evidence suggests that, as in neurodegenerative disorders,
protein aggregation may be present in schizophrenia. This could alter the functioning of neurons and contribute
to pathogenesis. Furthermore, since Alzheimer’s disease can present with psychiatric symptoms, and these
symptoms may occur prior to cognitive decline, some of the cellular processes that cause proteins to
aggregate in Alzheimer’s disease may be comparable to those in schizophrenia. Intriguingly, our data suggest
that aggregation may occur more often in female compared to male patients with schizophrenia. We
hypothesize that the overlapping proteomic changes associated with protein aggregation in schizophrenia and
Alzheimer’s disease will implicate genes and proteins, and thus specific cellular processes, associated with the
sex differences in neuropsychiatric symptoms and psychosis observed in Alzheimer’s disease. In order to test
this hypothesis, we proposed to analyze proteomic data using a bioinformatics approach in order to
characterize the cellular processes associated with aggregated proteins present in schizophrenia versus
control postmortem brains (Aim 1). We will then analyze proteomic data using a bioinformatics approach in
order to identify potentially overlapping aggregated proteins present in schizophrenia versus Alzheimer’s
postmortem brain with psychosis (Aim 2). Finally, we will use a genomics approach to determine whether the
genes from the set of overlapping proteins identified in Aim 2 are enriched in genome wide association studies
for neuropsychiatric symptoms related to Alzheimer’s disease. We will also perform a sub analysis to
determine whether this enrichment is more predominant in women than men (Aim 3). This proposal may
provide evidence that the mechanisms responsible for aggregation in schizophrenia contribute to the
neuropsychiatric symptoms that occur in Alzheimer’s disease, particularly those observed in women.
Exploration into this subject could elucidate pathogenesis and ultimately provide therapeutic targets. Further,
this research plan is complemented by an integrated training plan that focuses on training in 1) analytical
biostatistics and computational methods, 2) quantitative proteomic and genomic analysis and 3) interpretation
of proteomic and genomic data and its biological context, including the clinical and neurobiological aspects of
AD, all of which will facilitate the candidate’s development into an independent investigator."
10900579,"Thyroid eye disease (TED), also referred to as thyroid-associated orbitopathy or ophthalmopathy is the most
common orbital pathology. TED is an autoimmune disease that occurs in up to half of patients with Graves’
disease. In TED, the tissues surrounding the eye become inflamed and ultimately remodel to cause protrusion
of the eyes, swelling around the eyes, alteration of lid position, and double vision. In the most advanced cases,
the expanded tissues compress the optic nerve, causing vision impairment. These clinical manifestations of TED
reflect tissue changes triggered by autoantibodies that activate orbital fibroblasts that stimulate proliferation of
lipid-laden adipocytes and scar-forming myofibroblasts. Orbital fibroblasts also produce excessive amounts of
extracellular matrix composed of hyaluronan and collagen, which further increases the size and stiffness of
orbital tissue. There is presently no cure for TED; corticosteroids, radiation therapy, and surgery are routinely
used to manage TED symptoms and signs. Teprotumumab, an insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R)
blocking antibody has emerged as the first disease-specific treatment for TED. However, a critical knowledge
gap that limits our understanding of TED is how autoantibodies activate IGF1R signaling in orbital fibroblasts to
promote eye disease. IGF1R can stimulate proliferation and increase myofibroblast formation. The predominant
antigen in TED is the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR). How IGF1R interacts with TSHR and TED
autoantibodies in the disease is a fundamental and unresolved question. One potential mechanism is through
the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). The AHR is a ligand-activated transcription factor that binds synthetic and
naturally derived aromatic hydrocarbons. The AHR controls aspects of cell growth, development and the immune
system. Evidence suggests that AHR blocks TSHR and IGF1R signaling in vivo and in vitro. However, the
mechanism(s) are unclear and whether the AHR regulates these pathways in TED is unknown. One of the most
significant risk factors for developing TED is smoking. Smoking activates a transcription factor called hypoxia
inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1a). AHR and HIF1a compete to control cell fate. Smoking may disrupt the HIF1a-
AHR balance thereby further increasing IGF1R/TSHR signaling. Central Hypotheses: The AHR blocks
IGF1R/TSHR signaling, and loss of this interaction is a primary event in the pathophysiology of TED. Aim
1: Define the molecular pathway(s) by which the AHR blocks orbital fibroblast activation. Aim 2: Determine the
role of cigarette smoke exposure in promoting HIF1a and IGF1R signaling while blocking AHR in orbital
fibroblasts. Aim 3: Evaluate the ability of the AHR ligands to block TED autoantibody driven TSHR/IGF1R
signaling. Impact: Our findings will show that AHR blocks TSHR and IGF1R signaling in TED. Accomplishing
the specific aims will establish a molecular mechanism whereby smoking exacerbates IGF1R/TSHR signaling in
TED. Further, the experiments should provide critical evidence that activating the AHR pathway is a novel and
viable therapeutic target for treating TED."

10815809,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tamoxifen is the most prescribed cancer drug in the world. Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor
modulator (SERM) that is used to treat patients with breast tumors that express estrogen receptor alpha (ER),
acting as a partial antagonist that blocks ER’s growth-promoting activity. The use of tamoxifen has greatly
benefited breast cancer patients by significantly reducing the risk of recurrence. Unfortunately, several severe
side effects accompany the recommended 5-10-year course of tamoxifen treatment, including increased risk of
endometrial cancer. It has been shown that tamoxifen acts as an ER agonist in the endometrium and in
endometrial cancer cells. However, despite the initial observation of tamoxifen-associated endometrial cancer
more than 30 years ago, the molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. The leading hypothesis is that
different cofactors interact with ER upon tamoxifen binding and these cofactors differ between breast cancer
cells and endometrial cells. In this proposal, we will address the decades-old question of how tamoxifen acts
as an agonist in endometrial cells using cutting edge techniques. We will use two approaches to determine key
factors that underlie tamoxifen’s differential actions in breast and endometrial cancer. In specific aim 1, we will
focus on the cofactor hypothesis by applying RIME, which identifies co-occurring factors on chromatin, to
breast cancer cells and our unique collection of endometrial cancer and normal endometrial samples that have
undergone treatment with estradiol and 4-hydroxytamoxifen. In specific aim 2, we will cast a broader net by
using CRISPR approaches to identify genes essential for tamoxifen’s ER agonist role in endometrial cells and
compare results to similar studies in breast cancer cells. The successful completion of this project will lead to a
mechanistic understanding of how tamoxifen has dichotomous roles, being both an effective breast cancer
treatment and an endometrial cancer risk factor. This knowledge will aid in identifying alternative breast cancer
treatment strategies that reduce the chance of developing a deadly side effect and will help in discovering new
therapeutic targets for endometrial cancer patients."

Variability in the spatial layout of human brain functional networks on the anatomic cortex is a novel phenotype
that can be extracted from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with transformative potential for
combined imaging-genetics studies of human brain function. Early results show that the individual-specific
topography of Personalized Functional Networks (PFNs) is strongly associated with domains of psychopathology
and cognition, including executive functioning (EF) which is impacted in multiple mental health conditions and
undergoes profound changes during the period of adolescence. PFNs capture individualized aspects of brain
function that have unique associations with clinical and developmental outcomes, compared to standard fMRI
approaches, which can measure activity in these same functional networks but fail to incorporate the variation
in functional network topography that exists among individuals. The over-arching hypothesis of this proposal is
that targeting PFNs will rapidly accelerate the discovery of genetic contributions to the organization of brain
function, leading to mechanistic insights into genetic risks for behavioral health conditions related to brain
function. To this end, we will probe PFNs in genetically informative open fMRI datasets including the Adolescent
Brain and Cognitive Development Study (ABCD, n=11,572, n=850 twin pairs, 5 longitudinal time points during
study period) and the UK Biobank (UKBB, n>40,000), as well as locally acquired fMRI data on the 22q11.2
deletion syndrome (22qDS, n=100; controls n=500). Analyses will yield a cohesive investigation of inherited
polygenic effects and rare, typically de novo copy number variants (CNVs), each of which are hypothesized to
influence individualized functional network topography. First, we will use longitudinal twin models in ABCD to
investigate the twin heritability of PFNs and their genetic correlation with behavioral domains such as EF, for
example, testing the hypothesis that the genetic correlation between EF and association cortex PFNs will
increase during adolescence (Aim 1). Second, we will perform genome- and transcriptome-wide association
studies (GWAS and TWAS) of PFN topography in ABCD and UKBB to prioritize specific, functionally active
genetic loci (Aim 2). Third, we will investigate the influence of rare CNVs on PFNs, using analysis of case-control
Penn/CHOP 22q11.2DS data, in ABCD, CNV Risk Scores that we recently showed to correlate with deviations
from the typical development of brain anatomy in a community cohort (Aim 3). Allanalyses will be conducted
with fully reproducible, transparent imaging processing and genetic pipelines, capitalizing on the PI and
assembled team's joint expertise in advanced fMRI methods, genomics, and informatics. Cumulatively, the
completion of these aims will result in a major advance in our understanding of the genetic contributions to brain
function and its relationship to psychiatric risk, leading to future experimental and clinical trials of targeted
neuromodulation guided by individualized neurogenetics."
10828417,"Abstract
The epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a developmental process related to tissue repair and
pathological processes, has been found to occur in the progression of carcinomas to invasive and
metastatic disease. Accumulated evidence suggests the EMT could contribute to the
immunosuppressive function of cancer cells. However, the underlying molecular mechanism linking
EMT and immunosuppressive function in cancer remain largely unknown.
To tackle this problem, our research group developed an integrative transcriptomic approach to
combine expression profiling of breast cancer cell lines and several mammary epithelial cell EMT
models. This screen identified RNA-binding motif single-stranded interacting protein 3 (RBMS3) as
being significantly and reproducibly associated with EMT. We further showed that RBMS3 stabilized
a group of EMT-related genes, including PRRX1. Functional analysis demonstrated the
RBMS3/PRRX1 axis is responsible for maintaining mesenchymal status and motility properties of
breast cancer cells, as well as controlling a group of pro- inflammatory cytokines. More importantly,
knockdown of RBMS3 in TNBC MDA-MB231 cells results in a significant delay of tumorigenesis in
vivo, which is not observed in vitro. These results indicate RBMS3 mediates breast cancer
progression, potentially by simultaneously increasing invasive potential and promoting an
immunosuppressed tumor microenvironment. In this study, we propose to investigate the effect of
RBMS3/PRRX1 axis on immunosuppression and breast cancer progression in immunocompetent
animal models and explore the potential impact of targeting RBMS3/PRRX1 axis in facilitating
immunotherapy in TNBC models.
We expect the proposed studies to be completed within two years, with two critical outcomes: 1)
revealing the role of RBMS3/PRRX1 axis in driving TNBC progression through detailed analysis of the
alterations of immune- microenvironment; 2) proof-of-concept evidence that targeting
RBMS3/PRRX1 axis will facilitate immunotherapy for TNBC treatment. These results will lay a solid
foundation for further development of specific targeting RBMS3/PRRX1axis for treatment of TNBC.
By achieving these goals, we will be able to address the following overarching challenges: 1) identify
why some breast cancers become life-threatening metastases; and 2) eliminate or reduce the
mortality associated with metastatic breast cancer."
10890775,"ABSTRACT
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a chronic, recurrent illness impacting 20.6% of the U.S. population,
causing significant disability and an economic impact of $326.2 billion annually. One of the largest risk factors
for depression chronicity and disability is inadequate antidepressant response, defined as less than a 50%
improvement in depressive symptoms after starting antidepressant treatment. Antidepressants are
recommended as a first-line depression treatment and taken by 70% of patients with depression. Inadequate
antidepressant response is experienced by 50-60% of patients starting an antidepressant and is responsible
for 47% of the economic impact and disability caused by MDD. As such, identifying risk for inadequate
antidepressant response early, during a patient’s first clinical presentation for a depressive episode, would be
an innovative, urgently needed first step towards preventing recurrent depressive episodes, reducing
depression chronicity and disability, and improving MDD outcomes. This step aligns with The National Institute
of Mental Health (NIMH) Strategic Plan Objective 3.2 to “develop strategies for tailoring existing interventions
(antidepressants) to optimize (depressive episode) outcomes.”
While previous studies identified separate predictors of antidepressant response, no study to date has focused
on integrating known and novel predictors of inadequate antidepressant response during a patient’s first
depressive episode. This knowledge gap exists as no large studies in diverse populations have integrated
comprehensive clinical, demographic, genetic, AND behavioral information in one model to predict inadequate
antidepressant response prior to first antidepressant treatment. Such information is crucial to improve patient
care, reduce depressive disorder chronicity and disability, and tailor existing patient interventions to optimize
MDD outcomes. Utilizing electronic health record data from three large, integrated healthcare systems
representing over 6.9 million members (Kaiser Permanente (KP) Northern California, KP Washington, and
HealthPartners), we aim to quantify inadequate antidepressant response risk at the time of a patient’s first
clinical presentation for a depressive episode by integrating clinical, demographic, genetic, and behavioral
information in one predictive model. To accomplish this aim, we will use translational machine learning and
predictive modeling, internal and external model validation and testing, prospective validation, and existing
genome-wide genotypic data. Further, we will examine barriers and facilitators to clinical applications of
predictive models for MDD to facilitate clinical translation and implementation of the predictive model, reducing
the time between research innovation and clinical application. Our long-term goal is to develop a clinical tool
informing decision making and promoting MDD treatment optimization."
10806215,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The extracellular matrix in tissue is significantly disrupted in many disease conditions, but it is essential for
cells to function. Endothelial cells become leaky when they no longer receive functional matrix signals upon
tissue injury. Failure to restore endothelial barrier function can result in persistent edema, long-term tissue
damage, and irreversible tissue fibrosis. Since many organs are highly vascularized, there is a need to find a
general solution to treat tissue injury by restoring matrix-mediated signaling. There is currently no effective
strategy to achieve this goal, since the activation of matrix signaling pathways requires the delivery of matrix
molecules with proper molecular conformation and physiochemical properties. Here, we define a novel class of
cell-secreted, non-vesicular nanoparticles that bear matrix molecules, which we call matrimeres. Our
preliminary data show that mesenchymal stromal cells naturally secrete matrimeres consisting of fibronectin
and DNA, which can directly activate endothelial cells to restore junctions disrupted by endotoxemia-induced
injury. Importantly, we show that functional matrimeres can be reconstituted from purified fibronectin protein
and genomic DNA fragments in a chemical environment similar to secretory compartments in cells. We will
build on these results to test the hypothesis that fibronectin matrimeres treat tissue injury by restoring
endothelial barrier function. In Aim 1, we will determine how fibronectin matrimeres restore endothelial barrier
function after inflammatory injury in the lungs. In Aim 2, we will investigate biogenesis mechanisms of
fibronectin matrimeres in mesenchymal stromal cells. In Aim 3, we will engineer synthetic matrimeres that
restore endothelial barrier function. We predict that highly functional nanomedicine can be developed based on
the fundamental insight that cells are able to recycle and repackage matrix molecules into nanoparticles by
complexing with DNA fragments, which circulate in the body and play a homeostatic role in limiting vascular
permeability. The project is highly multidisciplinary in that it will employ a combination of expertise in nanoscale
biology, nanotechnology, chemical, biomaterials, computational, advanced imaging, cellular and molecular
biology, and in vivo approaches to address the specific aims. The results will help develop a number of
fundamental concepts of matrimeres in terms of their mechanisms of action, biogenesis, and reverse
engineering. Success of the project will also enable the generalization of matrimeres as natural nanomedicine
to deliver macromolecules for improved regenerative outcomes."

This application for continuing support focuses on the mechanisms by which the cysteinyl leukotrienes
(cysLTs), a class of potent lipid inflammatory mediators, facilitate type 2 (eosinophilic) immunopathology (T2I)
that underlies prevalent and burdensome respiratory diseases, including asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with
nasal polyps (CRSwNP). The proposal tests the hypothesis that leukotriene E4 (LTE4) initiates respiratory T2I
through engagement of the type 3 cysLT receptor (CysLT3R) and nucleotide signaling to P2Y2 receptors on
brush cells (BrCs). A second hypothesis is that LTE4-induced BrC activation elicits activation of group 2
innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) and type 2 cytokine generation through synergistic actions of IL-25 and
endogenously generated LTC4. A third hypothesis is that IL-25-driven eosinophil recruitment provides a pool
of LTC4-driven platelet-derived IL-33 to incrementally activate ILC2s and MCs, further amplifying T2I and its
consequences, including upstream BrC expansion. The proposal uses a combination of novel transgenic mice,
ex vivo approaches, and unique models to dissect a complex pathway by which cysLTs act in series
downstream of epithelial perturbation by leukotriene E4, the most stable cysLT, to activate MC, potently elicit
ILC2 activation, and induce severe immunopathology. The studies seek to explain the selective
hyperresponsiveness of asthmatic subjects to leukotriene E4, and to develop therapeutic strategies through the
selective targeting of receptors other than CysLT1R."

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) causes significant disease in patients with congenital or acquired immune deficiencies.
Elucidating markers of early cancer and understanding tumor composition are essential in improving diagnostics
and therapies for EBV diseases. In vitro, EBV infection of B cells induces formation of lymphoblastoid cell lines
(LCLs) which mimic properties of lymphoproliferative disease and serve as a model to investigate B cell
transformation processes. Multiple viral gene products dramatically reprogram the B cell environment, and
several host factors critical for maintaining LCL proliferation have been identified; however, host factors leading
to LCL outgrowth as well as the distinct cellular substages required for establishment of persistent infection and
B cell transformation are less understood. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms involved in these processes
is an ongoing challenge due to the refractory nature of primary B cells for genetic manipulation and the observed
heterogeneity in viral and cellular gene expression detected through standard bulk transcriptome analysis. To
address gaps in our current knowledge, we will use multi-omic single-cell approaches to define B cell molecular
signatures and cell markers that delineate early virus-mediated transformation. For these studies, we will
investigate a pre-clinical EBV model, rhesus macaque (RM) cells and tumor tissues infected with rhesus
lymphocryptovirus (rLCV). By simultaneously measuring immunophenotypes and gene expression, we aim to
identify B cell states that successfully navigate infection towards the LCL trajectory. Leveraging these
approaches to further analyze rLCV+ lymphoid tissues, we aim to define biological properties of pre-cancerous
and cancerous states at the single cell level."

10890078,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Heart rate is one of the most widely used and informative metrics of health. Yet, the neural circuits which
determine heart rate are only partly known. Over a century of research has shown that heart rate is oppositely
controlled by the two branches of the autonomic nervous system, which increase (sympathetic) or decrease
(parasympathetic) heart rate in response to the body’s changing needs for circulation. Parasympathetic input to
the heart occurs through the vagus nerve, a cranial nerve which carries axons from hindbrain parasympathetic
neurons, known as cardiovagal neurons, to downstream neurons in the cardiac ganglia. The vast majority of
cardiovagal neurons reside in the nucleus ambiguus (nAmb) of the hindbrain. However, the nAmb is also home
to a variety of other neurons, which presents significant technical challenges to studying the cardiovagal
subset. For instance, intermingled with the nAmb’s cardiovagal neurons are parasympathetic neurons which
mediate pulmonary function (bronchoconstriction, bronchosecretion) and motor neurons controlling upper
airway and esophageal muscles. The inability to access the cardiovagal subset has greatly limited what we
know about their synaptic circuitry, gene expression, and specific roles in heart function. Thus, there is much to
learn about the nature of these important neurons, how they function, and how they can be targeted to treat
heart disease. To address these issues, our proposal will leverage the molecular diversity of nAmb neurons in
mouse models to comprehensively classify neuron subtypes by their gene expression. Then, utilizing genetic
differences between the nAmb neuron subtypes to gain access, we will trace each subtype’s synaptic inputs
and outputs using viral vectors, and then activate and inactivate each subtype to reveal their specific
physiological roles. Preliminary studies have identified three subtypes of nAmb neurons, one of which
innervates multiple sites in the heart, and shown the feasibility of our approach to mapping and manipulating
specific neural circuits. The results of the proposed studies will define the molecular and functional
organization of the nAmb and yield unprecedented insight into the neurons, neural circuit, and signaling
pathways that control heart rate."

10839424,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Further characterization of longitudinal lung function (LLF) throughout adulthood in asthmatics is critically
important, as low lung function correlates with increased exacerbations, morbidity, and mortality. Precise
genomic and metabolomic profiling of the biological mechanisms underlying LLF trajectories will be
instrumental in understanding and ameliorating lung function deterioration. MicroRNAs (miRs; short non-coding
RNAs) exhibit broad impact on inflammatory cascades, leading to airway remodeling and chronic airway
obstruction, and specific metabolites provide a measure of real-time inflammatory changes that reflect both
genetic and environmental influences. Therefore, the combined use of miRs and metabolites has great
potential to provide critical insight into disease physiology and identify mechanisms to regulate, diagnose, and
prognosticate LLF. The objective of this proposal is to identify miRNA and metabolomic determinants of LLF
patterns, classified using longitudinal spirometry measures from electronic medical records (EMRs), that
accurately identify individuals with asthma at the greatest risk of progression to more serious chronic lung
obstruction. Our central hypothesis is that LLF trajectories are regulated by specific sets of genes, miRNAs,
and metabolites that can 1) inform on underlying biological dysregulation and 2) serve as biomarkers to
distinguish clinically actionable patterns of LLF, enabling personalized medicine approaches through the
identification of multiomic therapeutic targets. We will explore this hypothesis by generating the novel and
unique Biobank of Asthmatics with Longitudinal Lung Function (BALLF) cohort; which includes rigorous LLF
phenotyping generated from electronic medical records (Aim 1a) and global metabolomics profiling and
miRNA sequencing (Aim 1b) supplementing existing genetic and phenotypic data. We will identify metabolites
(Aim2a) and miRNAs (Aim2b) associated with these LLF; capitalizing on our rich preliminary data implicating
sphingolipid and eicosanoid biosynthesis to guide our analyses. Finally, we will leverage our extensive systems
biology expertise to integrate this multiomic data to improve our biological understanding of LLF (Aim3a) and
to develop clinically translatable biomarkers (Aim 3b). Crucially, we have the ability to both validate these
findings and to assess their generalizability in two existing independent cohorts of asthmatics. This will
represent the first integrative omic study of LLF trajectories in asthma focusing on the unique combination of
miRs, metabolites, and genes; as such the findings of this innovative proposal have tremendous potential to
elucidate the biological mechanisms of lung function decline and to influence the management of asthmatics at
risk of this devastating complication."

 Sarcoidosis, one of the most common interstitial lung diseases, affects 49-141 per 100,000 individuals
in the United States (US). Compared to US non-Hispanic whites, African Americans have a 3-5 fold higher
incidence of sarcoidosis. Up to half of patients develop chronic disease with considerable morbidity.
Sarcoidosis is not only a cause of end-stage pulmonary fibrosis, cor pulmonale, and pulmonary hypertension,
but can lead to sudden death, neurologic and other solid organ impairment. Despite the impact of the disease,
there has been limited research investment or progress in sarcoidosis.
 Individuals with sarcoidosis require long-term treatment to prevent disease progression. Continuous
daily treatment has been associated with better lung function compared to intermittent treatment. This
suggests that intermittent medication, such as occurs when patients are non-adherent, may be associated with
worse lung function. Our preliminary data suggests higher self-reported medication adherence is associated
with higher health related quality of life among individuals with sarcoidosis. In sarcoidosis, treatment can
prevent disease progression and higher medication adherence may improve clinical outcomes.
 Self-management interventions that address patient gaps in knowledge and address barriers and
facilitators to adherence have been shown to improve clinical outcomes in other chronic respiratory diseases.
Psychological health, social determinants, and treatment characteristics have been associated with self-
management and/or clinical outcomes. Our preliminary qualitative data show that individuals with sarcoidosis
report knowledge gaps in disease understanding and treatment that may affect their own self-management.
Identifying determinants of adherence will identify potential targets for a future self-management intervention
tailored for sarcoidosis, which currently has no existing evidence based behavioral interventions.
 We will enroll 150 individuals from the Johns Hopkins Sarcoidosis Clinic with biopsy proven pulmonary
sarcoidosis for at least 12 months and who have been on treatment for at least 6 months into a 12-month
longitudinal study. The goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the association between objectively measured
medication adherence and clinical outcomes, evaluate determinants that are associated with medication
adherence, and develop and refine a self-management intervention for individuals with sarcoidosis. The data
will inform an R01 to evaluate the efficacy of a behavioral intervention targeting knowledge gaps, improving
coping, and addressing barriers to adherence to increase patient’s ability to manage their sarcoidosis."
10769891,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This R21 project will use potent chemical inhibitors of bacterial cell-to-cell signaling to develop new
materials and explore innovative approaches to prevent bacterial infections in skin wounds. Skin
wound infections cause suffering and distress in over 6 million patients and incur treatment costs totaling over
$25 billion annually in the US. The current arsenal of drugs available to treat these infections is now almost
completely depleted due to the rise of bacterial resistance. Fundamentally new ‘anti-virulence’ approaches that
move beyond conventional antibiotic strategies and target bacterial virulence rather than cell growth could
provide means to address this threat and have major impacts on medical care. This current proposal seeks to
develop such an approach by targeting a chemical signaling pathway—quorum sensing (QS)—that controls
virulence in many of the antibiotic resistant bacteria common to skin wounds, including Staphylococcus aureus.
 QS in bacteria has emerged as an attractive target in the anti-virulence field because it controls many of
the primary mechanisms that underlie bacterial infection, including toxin production, adhesion, immune
evasion, and biofilm formation. These processes can have widespread and devastating effects on human
health. Many pathogenic bacteria utilize QS to launch synchronized attacks on their hosts only after they have
achieved a high cell density, thereby overwhelming the host’s defense mechanisms. Synthetic molecules
capable of blocking QS represent a direct approach to inhibit bacterial virulence. Interest in such QS inhibitors
(QSIs) has exploded over the past 20 years, but characterization of the activities of QSIs in vivo remains in its
infancy. The in vivo studies to date have relied on either (i) QSIs with poor potency, unknown mechanisms,
and/or off-target effects; or (ii) animal infection models that, while easy to perform, are not highly relevant to
typical skin wound infection. New compounds, methods, and models are required to push the QS field forward.
 This R21 project will leverage a QSI recently developed by the PI—the most potent QSI to be reported—to
advance new approaches and materials to block S. aureus wound infections. These objectives will be
accomplished by the pursuit of two Aims: (1) investigation of the ability of the QSI to attenuate S. aureus
infections in a well-tested mouse model of skin wound infection, and (2) characterization of combinations of the
QSI with current antibiotics to explore synergies and enhance bacterial clearance in wound infections. Both
Aims will integrate sustained release strategies using degradable polymers to explore and define optimal
delivery approaches for the use of QSIs in wounds. Our investigations will be led by an expert team with >15
years of collective collaborative experience and unite the PI’s synthetic QSIs with the expertise of the Co-Is in
materials-based drug delivery approaches, clinical microbiology, and animal models of wound infection. The
outcomes of this project will significantly expand the understanding of bacterial QS in an animal model relevant
to human wound infection and provide critical validation for QS inhibition as a route to ameliorate disease."

The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate multimodal mechanisms underlying selective vulnerability of
neuronal and non-neuronal cells to proteinopathies during the progression of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The
most notable feature of AD is its strikingly age- and sex-dependent regional onset and progression–selective
vulnerability–which is manifest in distinct clinical presentations, e.g., memory impairment in AD and patterns of
brain degeneration. Recent studies on the staging of AD neuropathology showed AD-related tauopathy begins
in the locus coeruleus (LC), followed by neurofibrillary tangles in the entorhinal cortex (EC), followed by
hippocampal (HC), and then neocortex, e.g., prefrontal cortex (PFC). One hypothesis for selective vulnerability
is that major AD risk genes are regionally restricted, but the results show they are rather broadly expressed. A
body of evidence support that glia play multiple essential roles at different brain region in AD pathogenesis.
These data suggest that selective vulnerability is likely a result of interplay of intrinsic properties of neurons
and glial cells in their response to proteinopathies in a dynamic and spatiotemporal manner at vulnerable brain
regions. For example, EC neurons project multiple brain regions including the EC, PFC and cerebellum. Yet,
degeneration of EC and PFC occurs at different stages. In contrast, the cerebellum is largely not affected.
There is emerging evidence that subpopulations of microglia treat excitatory and inhibitory neurons differently.
Could different glial cell types or differential response to proteinopathies in different projecting sources and/or
targets contribute to selective vulnerability? These results underscore the central importance of understanding
the diversity of cell types and molecular signature differences in both sexes at spatiotemporal, single-cell
resolution and multimodal scales between vulnerable and less vulnerable neuronal and glial populations
susceptible to proteinopathies in AD. MAPTS305N;Int10+3 and APPNL-F knock-in (KI) AD mice displaying Tau and Aβ
proteinopathies, respectively, will be used to achieve this goal. Preliminary results were obtained to support the
project. First, barcoded single-neurons brain-wide projection mapping in controls demonstrates sex- and age-
dependent differences in projections of LC neurons to selective targets. The results showed reciprocal
innervations among these four brain regions. Second, the analysis of 16-month-old control and APPNL-F mice
showed aberrant innervation patterns by norepinephrine (NE) neurons. Third, impaired prepulse inhibition
(PPI) has been suggested to be a biomarker for prodromal AD. Importantly, PPI impairment was observed in
the 5-month-old APPNL-F mice. Finally, single nuclei (sn)-RNAseq of the EC from 16-month-old control and
APPNL-F mice showed selective loss of neuronal and non-neuronal cell types and differential expression of a list
of genes, including those associated with neuronal and glial function and impaired PPI. Sn-transcriptomics
and-epigenomics will be employed to identify vulnerable cell types followed by spatial transcriptomics to
investigate spatiotemporal correlation between proteinopathies and vulnerable cell types and gene networks."

 The piRNA pathway is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that acts in the germline of metazoans to
repress the activity of transposable elements and ensure genome integrity and fertility. At the core of the pathway
lies an Argonaute protein of the Piwi clade and the associated small non-coding RNA, piwi-interacting (pi)RNA,
which guides the Piwi protein to its targets. In the cytoplasm Piwi proteins act by destroying the mRNA targets
using their intrinsic nuclease activity. piRNA also guide nuclear the Piwi to establish repressive chromatin and
induce transcriptional repression of genomic targets. We have found that SUMO and an E3 SUMO ligase play
an essential role in piRNA-guided transcriptional repression by linking the nuclear Piwi complex to the chromatin
modifier. However, individual steps of piRNA-guided chromatin repression remain poorly understood. In this
proposal, we will investigate the molecular mechanism of piRNA-guided repression. We will determine how the
SUMO ligase is recruited to genomic piRNA targets and explore the role of SUMO in assembly of the repressive
piRNA complexes.
 We will determine functions of Piwi and piRNA in establishment of repressive chromatin and initiation of piRNA
biogenesis. In addition to its function in the germline of adult flies, the maternal Piwi-piRNA complex is deposited
into the egg and was proposed to activate piRNA biogenesis in the progeny. However, Piwi is indispensable for
oogenesis preventing direct interrogation of its embryonic function. To circumvent this problem and study the
function of maternal Piwi in embryogenesis we have developed a strategy for depleting maternal Piwi in the
embryo. We will apply this strategy to probe the role of Piwi in specification of piRNA clusters in primordial germ
cells. How distinct chromatin domains are demarcated is the central question of chromatin biology. In animals,
heterochromatin is disassembled in gametes and re-established during embryogenesis. How heterochromatin
is assembled de novo during development remains poorly understood. Transposable elements comprise the
bulk of heterochromatin, making Piwi-piRNA complexes an ideal tool for finding and marking heterochromatin
sequences. During early zygotic development maternal Piwi-piRNA complexes are localized to somatic nuclei of
the embryo. We propose that Piwi-bound piRNAs direct de novo establishment of repressive chromatin domains
in somatic cells of the early embryo followed by its piRNA-independent propagation and maintenance during
later development. We will explore this model by depleting maternal Piwi and analyzing its effect on chromatin.
 The proposed work will advance our knowledge of RNA-mediated regulation and of transcription chromatin
structure in animals. We explore the function of piRNA in transmission of epigenetic information from generation
to generation. Our studies promise to shed new light on how distinct chromatin domains are demarked. A detailed
mechanistic understanding of Piwi-induced silencing, which prevents transposon activity and DNA damage in
germ cells, will facilitate the development of individualized treatment strategies for human sterility."

The PI’s lab explores the role of mechanical forces in physiological and pathological phenomena. To accomplish
this goal, they engineer and probe in vitro models of multi-scale biological systems using bioengineering tools
such as microfabricated devices; novel combinations of cells, molecular biology techniques, and cell mechanics
tools; and custom quantitative image processing software. They currently use this framework in three main lab
focus areas: (1) Exploring the mechanobiology of the vascular endothelium in the context of health, disease,
and drug delivery; (2) Probing cell-cell interactions at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in health and disease; and
(3) Understanding basic mechanisms of cell adhesion, migration, and division using engineered cellular
microenvironments and model cell systems. Over the next 5 years, the PI’s goal is to establish an NIGMS-MIRA-
funded research program that explores critical, outstanding questions about how aquaporins (water channels on
the cell membrane) regulate cell migration.
The PI’s proposed MIRA research program is motivated by strong phenomonological evidence for the role of
aquaporins (AQPs) in cell migration, coupled with a lack of mechanistic links between AQP expression or function
and cell behavior, which leaves open critical questions about how AQPs contribute to these physiological
phenomena. Hence, the proposed work seeks to explore numerous questions related to fundamental aspects
about the regulation of cell migration, with questions centering around whether and how AQPs modulate cell
polarization, cell biomechanical properties, migration phenotypes, and response to the microenvironment. The
PI’s lab is uniquely positioned to address these outstanding questions using an integrated experimental and
theoretical approach, by incorporating our established techniques in cell migration, cell mechanobiology and
biomechanics, live cell imaging, molecular biology, microfabrication and microenvironment engineering, and
quantitative analysis."
10813043,"Project Summary/Abstract. Over one million people died from tuberculosis in 2021. Current treatments are
long, costly, and often induce severe adverse effects, but the current vaccine has not been improved in over 100
years. Improved understanding of the host factors that influence Mtb pathogenesis in the lung may dramatically
improve control and transmission of Mtb between individuals. Before entering the alveolar macrophage, Mtb
encounters respiratory mucins. Mucins are glycosylated macromolecules that encompass the first line of defense
against pathogens. Respiratory mucins MUC5B and MUC5AC protect the lung from pathogens via mucociliary
clearance, directly inhibiting antimicrobial growth, and altering macrophage signaling. However, little is known
about how these macromolecules influence Mtb susceptibility and severity. In this pilot grant, we will evaluate
how respiratory mucins impact Mtb pathogenesis using human genetic studies, combined with interrogation of
their mechanism of action via small animal models recapitulating Muc5b or Muc5ac insufficiency, deficiency, or
overexpression. Our long-term goal is to identify strategies for effective Mtb killing within the lung and improve
mucosal delivery of relevant candidate Mtb vaccines. The objective of this grant is to characterize the
mechanisms by which MUC5B and MUC5AC, the two commonest respiratory mucins, influence Mtb
susceptibility and severity in human populations. The rationale for this study is that respiratory mucins are
essential for mucociliary clearance, support a host of extracellular antimicrobial peptides and proteins in the lung,
and coats pathogens to alter their pathogenicity in the lung. Our preliminary data demonstrates that common
genetic variants in the MUC5B promoter region are associated with pulmonary TB and MUC5B mRNA
expression in the lung, while variation in the MUC5AC gene region is associated with TB meningitis mortality
and MUC5AC mRNA expression. The central hypothesis is that MUC5B and MUC5AC are physical barriers to
infection and also modulate macrophage function and systemic immune homeostasis to worsen TB disease
severity. In this grant, we will test this hypothesis by achieving the following specific aims: 1) We will define the
functional SNPs that regulate MUC5B and MUC5AC gene expression in the lung, systemic immune responses
to TB meningitis, and susceptibility to and severity of TB in a Vietnamese cohort. 2) We will determine the
mechanism by which Muc5b and Muc5ac deficiency, knockout, and overexpression influence clinical and
immune responses to Mtb using genetically modified mice infected with Mtb. This contribution is significant
because mucins represent the first line of defense against Mtb infection, but their role in Mtb pathogenesis is
unknown. The proposed work is innovative because we will investigate the mechanisms and effects of a known
TB susceptibility gene using innovative mouse models of disease, combined with the genetic cohorts of TB
susceptibility. These studies will provide evidence that Mtb host defense begins prior to macrophage infection
and provide clues toward the role of the immune microenvironment on Mtb outcomes."
10774328,"In the US, RSV infects nearly 100% of children, and total associated hospital charges are estimated at
approximately $2.5 billion dollars. Infants are most susceptible to severe RSV-related disease in the first six
months of life. During this time, infants mount poorly protective antibody-mediated immunity on their own upon
RSV infection or vaccination. Rather they veer toward Th2-type responses, which can cause disease- or vaccine-
enhanced severity upon re-infection, and subsequent wheezing throughout childhood and into their teens. In
recent years, promising maternal RSV vaccine candidates have progressed to clinical trials, but the window of
protection to the infant remains limited to the half-life of the maternally-derived antibody (~1 month) or moderately
longer if the mother is breast feeding. An RSV vaccine that protects infants beyond the first month of life or
ameliorates the course of their respiratory disease, will (i) reduce the frequency of infant hospitalizations, (ii)
improve the quality of life for infants, families, communities, and populations, and (iii) lessen disease burden on
the US economy.
In this multiple PI project, we seek to optimize and characterize a nanoparticle-based intranasal RSV vaccine
platform with intrinsic adjuvant properties. The biodegradable biotin-nanoparticle system (referred to as bNP)
functions as an antigen carrier and immune activator. Coupling antigen delivery and adjuvant properties into a
single physical entity will enhance the capacity to overcome the inherent immunosuppressive environment of
mucosal tissues. The particle system has a tunable design in which the dose of the antigen can be varied without
remanufacturing. To ensure a Th-1 type response, we will use a variant RSV prefusion protein (preF) engineered
to lock in the native conformation as the cargo antigen.
We hypothesize that preF sterically stabilized on bNP (preF-bNP) will activate antigen-presenting cells to induce
important correlates of protection, including RSV-specific Th1-dominant T cell response, CD8 resident memory T
cells, and neutralizing antibody. Three specific aims are proposed. In Aim 1 we will optimize display of preF on
bNP and capacity of the formulation to activate antigen presenting cells. In Aim 2 we will determine preF-bNP
uptake kinetics into antigen presenting cells and preF-bNP-induced immunity in vivo, including resident memory T
cells. In Aim 3 we will establish the safety and efficacy of intranasal preF-bNP in an RSV mouse model.
Successful completion of the studies will lead pave the way for advancing a novel RSV vaccine formulation for
generating safe and protective RSV immunity in young children."
10795901,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a brain-based disorder that affects nearly 300 million people worldwide.
Recent theoretical models and empirical studies have highlighted glutamate (Glu) as a key neurotransmitter in
the pathophysiology of MDD that may be an important target for novel antidepressants. Using proton magnetic
spectroscopy (1H MRS), several studies have identified lower concentrations of Glu and other related metabolites
(e.g., glutamine, Gln) in depressed patients in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). However, given the dynamic
nature of the Glu–Gln cycle (Glu can be metabolized in neurons as part of the tricarboxylic acid [TCA] cycle or
synthesized into Gln, which is a precursor to both GABA and Glu, in astrocytes), it is critical to generate novel
imaging methods that will clarify which aspects of Glu metabolism underlie MDD. Doing so will advance our
understanding of MDD and elucidate the mechanisms underlying fast-acting antidepressants targeting
glutamatergic neurotransmission (e.g., ketamine). In this context, carbon-13 (13C) MRS with 13C-labeled
substrates has been the only method to evaluate the Glu–Gln cycle, but this method has limited clinical
applications due to significant technical challenges. Deuterium (2H) metabolic imaging has also been recently
presented as a tool for detecting Glx (Glu+Gln) following oral administration of deuterated glucose (2H-glucose),
as this method contains higher overall sensitivity compared to 13C MRS but is unable to resolve Glu from Gln.
Thus, the goal of the present proposal is to develop an interleaved 1H/2H MRS acquisition combined with 2H-
glucose on a 7T scanner to establish the reliable detection of Glu metabolism in patients with MDD. In Aim 1,
we will develop the dynamic imaging protocol to obtain reliable measures of Glu metabolism following oral 2H-
glucose intake. Our benchmarks for determining the optimal dynamic acquisition protocol will be based on
maximizing signal-to-noise ratios of 1H Glu, 1H Gln, and 2H Glx and temporal resolution (time per block of 1H or
2H MRS) and determining the time course when kinetic curves for label exchange reaches steady-state. We will
validate our optimized protocol in an independent sample of patients with MDD and age- and sex-matched
healthy controls and hypothesize that both groups will exhibit comparable test-retest reliability (repeatability
coefficient > 0.95). In Aim 2, we will develop methods to fit a simplified kinetic metabolic model to estimate the
rates of TCA and Glu–Gln cycling, and will test the hypothesis that MDD is characterized lower baseline (as
measured during the pre-glucose acquisition) levels of Glu and Gln, and slower Glu metabolism (as measured
by the metabolic cycling rates) in ACC. The novel imaging protocol and the metabolic metrics we develop will
stimulate innovative research on elucidating the mechanisms of fast-acting antidepressants targeting
glutamatergic neurotransmission (e.g., ketamine)."
10818574,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hormonal contraceptives (HC) are used by 10 million people in the United States alone. While HC have played
an important role in revolutionizing women’s health, the impact of HC on the brain have not been well studied,
especially during adolescence when HC use often begins. There is a critical need for this knowledge as a
growing number of recent studies suggest that use of HC, specifically among adolescents, is associated with
subsequent antidepressant use, greater likelihood of developing depression, and increased suicide risk.
Adolescence is a critical period of hormone-mediated brain development. Among the brain regions with the most
significant maturational changes during adolescence is the prefrontal cortex (PFC), or medial prefrontal cortex
(mPFC) in rodents. Because of the extended period of PFC/mPFC development and its well-known role in
depression, our central hypothesis is that adolescent exposure to contraceptive hormones may exacerbate the
risk for mood dysregulation by perturbing normal PFC development. We will employ daily administration of
hormones commonly used in HC (ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel) to adolescent rats and examine
interrelated endocrine, brain, and behavioral endpoints of relevance to the mPFC. Particular domains of interest
in these studies include central steroid hormone levels and receptor expression (Aim 1), synaptic pruning and
microglia-synaptic interactions (Aim 2), and long-term programming of behavioral outcomes dependent on
mPFC, including stress coping and cognitive flexibility (Aim 3). The research proposed in this application is
innovative because it investigates a widely used pharmaceutical for which there is little known about its effects
on the brain during an important time of the female lifespan when the potential to shape the trajectory of neural
development is high. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to generate knowledge about
the effects of adolescent HC use on the female PFC. Ultimately, neuroscientific studies on HC will advance
women’s health research and are a much needed step in achieving our long term goal of advancing knowledge
of how sex specific factors influence the brain across the lifespan."
10908306,"PROJECT SUMMARY: ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
All three Partnering institutions, Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM), Tuskegee University (TU), and the UAB
O’Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center (UAB OCCC), have established Administrative Cores. As part of the
currently active U54, efficient administrative infrastructure is in place at each of the three institutions. This core's
primary objectives are for coordination, communication, budgetary oversight, and clerical functions associated
with the overall research program proposed in this grant application. The Partnership has four Cores
(Administrative, Outreach, Planning and Evaluation, and Research Education), Research Projects (two Full
Projects and a Pilot Project), and two Shared Resources (Bioethics and Biostatistics/Bioinformatics). The
Partnership Administrative Core, which is responsible for administrative management of Partnership-wide
activities, is comprised of the institution-specific Executive Committees (ECs), the Partnership Leadership
Committee (PLC), the Internal Advisory Committee (IAC), and the Program Steering Committee (PSC). The
ECs, consisting of all institution-specific Principal Investigators (PIs) (contact-PI, MPIs, and Co-Leaders of all
cores and shared resources), meet once a month and are responsible for the day-to-day oversight at each
institution. The PLC, consisting of the PIs and co-leaders of all three institutions, as in the past, will have a
monthly teleconference and will be responsible for internal planning, execution, and assessment of the
Partnership activities. The IAC, consisting of six leaders (two from each Partnering institution), reviews, twice a
year, the Partnership’s progress and decisions and guides the overall Partnership. The PSC, consisting of five
external members, whose expertise covers all areas of the proposed research programs, and an NCI-official as
an ex-officio member, functions as the external review body, which annually evaluates all components of the
Partnership’s progress and provides guidance. Further, together with Planning and Evaluation Core, a Scientific
Review Committee, consisting of all PIs and a science editor, will solicit pilot projects to be funded in years 4 and
5 of the funding cycle and assigns them to external reviewers to assess their scientific merit and funds them after
obtaining approvals from PSC. The expertise of the PIs of all three institutions is complementary to each other,
and most of these leaders have been productively working together for more than 10 years. Together with
Administrative/Finance Officers of the respective institutions, the Program Managers aid the Partnership by
providing day-to-day administrative support, coordination, preparation of the annual progress reports, and
logistical services needed to accomplish the Partnership functions. Additionally, the Presidents and PIs of all
three institutions will continue to conduct yearly joint video conferences to discuss progress of the Partnership
and to reaffirm their continued commitment to strengthen, integrate, and expand Partnership activities."
10873356,"This application represents a competitive renewal of a highly-successful institutional postdoctoral training grant
based in Stanford's Center for Interdisciplinary Brain Sciences Research (CIBSR), under the direction of Dr.
Allan Reiss. The training program is situated within an exceptionally diverse and research-intensive environment
that is designed to facilitate the development of a new-generation of investigators who have the knowledge and
skills necessary to conduct innovative, interdisciplinary research at the forefront of child psychiatry and
neurodevelopment. Physician (MD, PhD) and PhD candidates who have the potential to develop highly
productive preclinical, clinical or translational research careers are preferentially recruited and accepted into the
program. Physician candidates are eligible if they have completed at least three years of psychiatry, pediatrics
or neurology training and/or wish to combine the T32 program with their current clinical residency or fellowship
training. PhD candidates are eligible if they have completed their doctorate with distinction in relevant fields
including psychology, neuroscience and computational (data) sciences. Candidates who articulate a strong
desire to further develop their expertise, experience and productivity to address critical precision medicine
themes in pediatric neuropsychiatry and neurodevelopment are preferentially selected.
 The program is now in its 26th year. Twenty-nine postgraduate trainees (5 MDs, 2 MD/PhDs and 22 PhDs)
have been in the program in the past 15 years. We successfully attained all predefined metrics during the current
grant period. The program attracted a very large pool of first-rate applicants (n=75), filled all funded slots (four
per year, total of 10 fellows through May 2020), retained all trainees for 2-3 years (except one fellow who is
joining the faculty after one year), and prepared trainees for successful careers as independent investigators.
We also continue to diversify the assignment of mentors and consider co-mentorship the “norm”. Though
topically-focused, the scientific scope of the program is broad, with basic, clinical and translational research-
oriented fellows. Several new junior mentors (who will “partner” with senior mentors) have been added, including
three faculty who are graduates of Stanford postdoctoral fellowships. We remain committed to attracting trainees
who come from an underrepresented minority background (two of 10 in the current period).
 During the next 5-year grant period, we will train an additional 9-11 fellows. Plans to increase MD or MD/PhD
recruitment from the current 2 of 10 fellows have been established. To meet our goal of significantly expanding
the knowledge base and methods of each trainee, we will continue to establish individually tailored didactic,
mentorship and research plans for each fellow while promoting cross-fertilization of scientific knowledge across
the trainee class. Using this approach, we focus the trainee's curriculum and research training on bridging
traditional, between-discipline gaps in methodology, and on focusing on the application of interdisciplinary
solutions to complex precision medicine issues in child psychiatry and neurodevelopment."
10880283,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The airway is composed of luminal cells such as club and ciliated cells that moisturize and clean the
airway, respectively. They are lined by basal cells that serve as progenitors for luminal cells in normal turnover
and injury repair. Proper balance of progenitor and luminal/differentiated cell ratio is critical for airway function.
While many genes have been identified that control individual cell fate, knowledge gaps remain in how the ratio
of progenitors and differentiated cells are globally regulated. In this study, we will investigate how airway cell
ratio is established in development, maintained in homeostasis and restored following injury.
 Our entry point is Lon protease 1 (LONP1), an ATP-dependent serine protease that functions in the
mitochondria matrix to degrade oxidized and misfolded proteins, thereby control protein quality and
mitochondria health. Mutations in LONP1 has been identified in congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH)
patients. CDH carries a high mortality rate associated with lung hypoplasia and pulmonary hypertension. To
address if Lonp1 plays a role in lung, we inactivated it in the developing lung epithelium and mesenchyme.
While the mesenchymal mutants survived to adult with no discernable phenotype, the epithelial mutants
exhibited lung hypoplasia and died at birth. Unexpectedly, these mutants also exhibited a striking increase of
basal cells at the expense of club and ciliated cells. Further preliminary data revealed an increase in integrated
stress response (ISR) pathway genes, and an increase of KDM6B, a key histone demethylase. In this study,
we will investigate the role of this mitochondria factor LONP1 in controlling airway cell fate balance via ISR
pathway (Aim 1), chromatin regulators (Aim 2) and in adult airway homeostasis and following influenza-
induced injury (Aim 3). Our findings will delineate a novel pathway from a mitochondria protease to ER ISR to
nuclear chromatin regulators in the fundamental control of airway cell fate."
10899450,"Project Summary / Abstract
Absence seizures occur in pediatric generalized epilepsy and involve excessive synchrony of the
thalamocortical neural network. An unexplored possibility is that aberrant activity-dependent myelination
contributes to absence seizure progression by promoting network synchrony. A recent discovery is that
neuronal activity drives myelin plasticity (changes in myelin structure) in vivo. Myelination, in turn, is a critical
determinant of neuronal network synchrony and function. Activity-regulated formation of new myelin requires
Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) signaling through its receptor, TrkB, on oligodendrocyte precursor
cells (OPCs). Pathological seizure activity may also induce changes in myelin structure, which in turn could
contribute to network dysfunction. This proposal investigates the relationship between absence seizures and
activity-dependent myelin plasticity. Preliminary data indicate that absence seizures are associated with
abnormally increased myelination in two rodent models with spontaneous absence seizures: Wag/Rij rats (a
widely used inbred rat strain) and Scn8a+/mut mice. These mice have a loss of function mutation in SCN8A,
similar to children with generalized epilepsy due to loss of function in SCN8A. Both models exhibit increased
OPCs and myelin sheath thickness in the anterior corpus callosum. Preventing seizures with ethosuximide
prevented the increased callosal myelination, indicating that seizures are required. My hypothesis is that
seizure-induced aberrant myelination facilitates excessive synchrony and contributes to seizure
burden. In Aim 1, the nature and extent of abnormal myelination in the thalamocortical network will be
investigated using magnetization transfer and diffusion-based magnetic resonance imaging of Scn8a+/mut mice.
Measurements will be validated by the gold standard method of quantifying myelination, electron microscopy.
Aim 2 will determine the role of activity-dependent myelination in thalamocortical hyper-synchrony underlying
absence seizures. This will be accomplished by conditionally deleting the TrkB receptor from OPCs in
Scn8a+/mut mice specifically during the period of seizure initiation and progression, using a novel mouse line
(Scn8a+/mut; trkB fl/fl; PDGFR::Cre). Indices of network synchrony will be measured in acute thalamic slices
from Scn8a+/mut mice with or without normal activity-dependent myelination. Aim 3 will determine whether
myelin plasticity contributes to seizure burden, by genetically blocking activity-dependent myelination as in Aim
2, and quantifying seizures with EEG. Thus, the proposed studies will use innovative methods to elucidate a
novel and potentially paradigm-shifting pathological mechanism in epilepsy, with implications for new
therapeutic strategies."

Project Summary
The lower esophageal sphincter (LES) is a thickened region of muscle between the distal esophagus and
proximal stomach. The LES develops contractile tone that forms a protective barrier and restricts acidic contents
of the stomach from being refluxed into and damaging the esophagus. LES tone is thought to be ‘myogenic’,
but LES muscles are not just composed of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and neurons. Rather, interstitial cells of
Cajal (ICC) are electrically coupled to SMCs and regulate the excitability of SMCs. For example, we found that
responses to nitrergic input, an important regulator of relaxation after swallowing, are reduced in animals with
loss of ICC (W/WV mice). This concept was criticized because manometric measurements in W/WV mice
displayed evidence of nitrergic relaxation. An important observation in these studies, but not investigated or
discussed in terms of mechanism, was that the LES in W/WV mice is hypotensive, suggesting that ICC provide
important functions in the LES, such as development and maintenance of tone. This project seeks to better
understand the mechanism of LES tone. Preliminary findings suggest that activation of Ca2+-dependent Cl-
channels (CaCC encoded by Ano1), most highly expressed by ICC in the LES, are responsible for a significant
portion of tone in these muscles. Ano1 channels are activated by spontaneous Ca2+ transients in ICC. The
inward current activated by Ca2+ causes depolarization of the syncytium and increases the open probability of
voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels in SMCs. The degree of contraction by this mechanism appears also to be
regulated by a mechanism known as Ca2+ sensitization, a process suggested in previous papers, but previous
findings are subject to other explanations. Here we propose to investigate the following: 1. Determine the
molecular and functional apparatus responsible for the electromechanical and pharmacomechanical regulation
of tone in the LES, 2. Examine how inputs from intrinsic neurons modulate the electromechanical and
pharmacomechanical mechanisms underlying LES tone. This study will utilize a variety of cutting-edge
techniques, such as transgenic mice, optogenetic monitoring of Ca2+ transients and biochemical analysis of
phosphorylation steps that either increase or inhibit Ca2+ sensitivity in SMCs. Many of these pre-clinical studies
will be performed on mice, but we will also perform parallel studies on Cynomolgus monkey LES, a primate with
significant genetic homology to humans.

10886552,"Abstract
Within any given organism, each cell has essentially identical genetic material, yet not all cells behave similarly.
One source of this remarkable diversity is the presence of chemical tags, like DNA methylation, that decorate
the genome and play roles in diverse biological processes including gene regulation, transposon silencing, and
imprinting. While it is known that the patterns of DNA methylation can differ between tissues or cell types, how
such patterns are generated and how they influence gene expression patterns remain poorly understood. As
aberrant DNA methylation patterns are associated with developmental defects in plants and with numerous
diseases in humans, understanding these aspects of epigenetic regulation are of critical importance.
Using the plant model, Arabidopsis thaliana, the lab recently discovered a family of four related chromatin
remodeling factors that control DNA methylation patterns in a locus- and tissue-specific manner. Based on new
insights gained during the characterization of these chromatin regulators, this proposal seeks to understand the
mechanisms that facilitate the locus-specific targeting of DNA methylation, to determine the checks and balances
that enable genome-scale homeostasis within methylation pathways, and to investigate how genetic and
epigenetic inputs are integrated to regulate DNA methylation patterns. Addressing these aspects of epigenetic
regulation will not only be important for understanding the roles of DNA methylation during normal growth and
development, but they will also provide insights into the causes and consequences of dysregulation within DNA
methylation pathways.
Arabidopsis thaliana is an ideal system to study epigenetic processes, like DNA methylation, as it is genetically
malleable, has a small genome that is highly amenable to genome-wide analyses, and is tolerant of dramatic
changes in its epigenetic landscape. In addition, many of the key players and pathways involved in establishing,
maintaining, and reading epigenetic modifications are conserved between plants and mammals. Given these
similarities, findings regarding how specific methylation patterns are generated and modulated during
development, will be applicable to analogous processes in mammals."
10844431,"Project Summary / Abstract
 Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) is a devastating form of childhood onset epilepsy with cognitive
dysfunction and very frequent generalized onset seizures (GOS) often leading to injury. Driven by the lack of
effective therapies and the demonstrated safety and efficacy of brain-responsive stimulation for medically
intractable focal onset seizures (FOS), this study will test whether brain-responsive neurostimulation of
thalamocortical networks (RNS-TCN) is a feasible strategy to treat LGS. Specifically, the project aims to:
(1) acquire preliminary evidence for safety and efficacy in treating GOS of LGS with RNS-TCN; (2) create an
interactive therapy-decision support system based on patient-specific computational network models and
machine learning to identify optimal lead placement and stimulation parameters.
 Using the RNS® System, which is FDA approved for FOS, an early feasibility IDE study will be conducted
at 6 epilepsy centers in 20 patients with LGS and medically intractable GOS. The patients will be enrolled in
two cohorts of 10, with safety and efficacy milestones in the first cohort governing the enrollment of the second
cohort. Patients will have two depth leads placed bilaterally in the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus and
two subdural strip leads placed bilaterally on the medial prefrontal cortex. These targets are selected because
they are implicated in the onset and spread of GOS in LGS. Leads will be located within each target such that
stimulation maximally engages the thalamocortical network, guided by finite-element biophysical models
created from structural magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion weighted imaging. The finite-element
biophysical models will also be used to identify the initial RNS-TCN stimulation pathway and current amplitude.
During the blinded evaluation period patients will be randomized to receive either high-frequency short burst
(HFSB) or low-frequency long burst (LFLB) RNS-TCN, then enter a washout period before crossing over to
receive the other treatment condition. During the open label period stimulation parameters can be modified at
the discretion of the physician. Parameter adjustments will be informed by using a Bayesian optimization
model developed for specifically for each patient. All clinical and electrophysiological data collected during the
study will be used to identify a biomarker of clinical response; if found, these will aid future epilepsy research
and clinical practice. If safety is favorable and there is preliminary evidence for efficacy, then this early
experience will inform the design of a future larger feasibility study.
 In addition to treating a population in need, this project engages in fundamental discovery of biomarkers in
generalized network epilepsies, and develops novel automated therapy selection policies that have the
potential to improve the lives of patients with LGS and other seizure disorders."

PROJECT SUMMARY
Significance: Uganda faces a high burden of tuberculosis (TB) with a prevalence rate of 253 per 100,000
people and an incidence rate of 201 per 100,000 people. Poor TB medication constrain treatment success for
the individual and increase its transmission. Financial incentives in form of conditional or unconditional cash
transfers have shown promise for improving TB care but the approach has mainly been implemented in
countries where TB is not a public health priority, and current approaches require costly face-to-face
interactions. Proposed intervention: My Mobile Wallet is a novel behavioral and economic intervention that
utilizes SMS texts to remind medication adherence and utilize mobile money approaches to provide transport
to the clinic and incentivize medication adherence. Our overall hypothesis is that My Mobile Wallet will
overcome behavioral issues, critical financial and motivational issues that currently constrain TB medication
adherence. Innovation: To our knowledge, our study is the first to assess the combination of an objectively
measured adherence, SMS reminders, and behavioral economics-based incentives (delivered via mobile
money) to support TB medication adherence. Approach: In R21 Aim 1, we first determine the optimal design
and develop My Mobile Wallet as an intervention to support TB medication adherence. Using user-centered
approaches, we will iteratively conduct focus group discussions with up to 30 TB patients recruited from the TB
clinic in Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH). We then assess the initial feasibility and acceptability of
using My Mobile Wallet to support TB medication, in R21 Aim 2 based on 40 adults with new diagnoses of
active, drug-sensitive TB MRRH. Feasibility will be assessed by receipt of cash transfers, SMS texts received,
and technical problems encountered. Acceptability will be assessed using system usability and interviews
based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology. In R33 Aim 1, we further refine and adapt My
Mobile Wallet, and then pilot test it in 10 TB patients over two months of treatment to ensure optimal
functionality. We then assess the refined My Mobile Wallet intervention for large-scale feasibility, acceptability,
and impact on TB treatment adherence and clinical outcomes (in R33 Aim 2) through a randomized control trial
composed of 162 TB patients followed for 6 months. Feasibility and acceptability will be assessed as described
above. Impact assessment will be based on electronically monitored medication adherence (primary), as well
as treatment completion, clinic attendance, cure rates, and mortality (secondary). Investigators/environment:
Our team brings expertise in mobile health technology design and adoption, and behavioral science (Drs
Musiimenta and Haberer), and behavioral economics (Dr. Linnemayr). Future directions: My Mobile Wallet is
designed with limited infrastructure needs, thus creating potential for real world implementation at scale that
can be tested in a future multisite cluster randomized (R01 grant)."
10890015,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and cell adhesion molecules (CAMs)
are three major families of cell surface proteins in all eukaryotic cells, and together represent the primary first
responders for cells to respond an extracellular stimulus and initiates a variety of signaling pathways to
subsequently regulate cell proliferation and differentiation, promote cell survival, and modulate cellular
metabolism and cell-to-cell communication. Mutations affecting these signaling pathways result in many human
syndromes and diseases, such as various types of neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. The clinical
importance of these signaling proteins has motivated the development of targeted therapies designed to block
the activation of the membrane receptors and the downstream signal transduction. Increasing evidence has
suggested that there is significant signaling crosstalk among these three membrane protein families at the
plasma membrane level and these proteins can form highly organized membrane micro- or nano-clusters with
unique biochemical and biophysical properties, dictating the signaling outcome. However, the molecular
mechanisms by which how such crosstalk and compartmentalization of membrane-associated signaling proteins
are initiated and maintained to modulate the sensitivity and specificity of the downstream signaling remain largely
elusive. Our recent discovery of a newly identified actin-spectrin-based membrane-associated periodic skeleton
(MPS) structure being a signaling platform for RTK transactivation by GPCRs and CAMs in neurons provides
molecular insights into how the cooperative action among these cell surface proteins can be coordinated to give
rise to the downstream signaling. The objective of this proposal is to combine super-resolution imaging, cell and
molecular biology tools, and mass spectrometry analyses, to investigate the distinctively physical molecular
mechanisms responsible for the MPS-mediated cell signaling, by identifying the key molecular interactions
responsible for the MPS-dependent assembly and disassembly of the signaling protein clusters (i.e., signaling
protein complexes) and examining the roles of liquid-liquid phase separation, receptor endocytosis, and contact
sites between the plasma membrane and intracellular membrane-bound intracellular organelles in the MPS-
mediated cell signaling in neurons. As the spectrin-actin based MPS structures likely exist in other differentiated
cell types such as lymphocytes and thereby control lymphocyte development and activation, our analyses will
also be extended to examine the role of the MPS in lymphocyte signaling during immune responses Our
proposed research will not only broaden our fundamental understanding of cell signal transduction controlled by
the membrane skeleton and the phase separation behaviors of signaling proteins in neurons and immune cells,
but also help suggest potential drug targets for human diseases including neurodegenerative diseases and
cancer."
10820141,"Abstract
 Bacterial persistence contributes to antibiotic treatment failure and the relapse of many recalcitrant
infections. Persisters are a subpopulation of transiently non-growing bacteria capable of surviving antimicrobial
attacks from antibiotics and the immune system and eventually resuming growth. Many pathogens including,
Salmonella enterica, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Staphylococcus aureus, form persisters within
macrophages where they survive extended periods of time. It was shown that, although non-growing, Salmonella
persisters retain the ability to express and inject effector proteins in macrophages leading to interference with
the host immune response and supporting persister survival. Nonetheless, persisters remain vulnerable to
macrophage-induced DNA damage in the form of double stranded breaks (DSBs) and require DSB repair
through homologous recombination. Strikingly, intramacrophage Salmonella persisters also actively replicate
chromosomal DNA and can accumulate more than four chromosome equivalents of DNA. I have found that
persisters replicate complete chromosomes despite growth arrest and that this chromosome amplification is
associated with a higher frequency of persister regrowth. I hypothesize that stresses encountered upon
macrophage entry trigger a specific state of growth arrest where atypical chromosome replication is enabled and
then favors repair of chromosomal DSBs by homologous recombination. To evaluate this hypothesis, I will
decipher the mechanisms and consequences of DNA synthesis in Salmonella persisters. In Aim 1, I will
characterize the contribution of chromosome amplification to homologous recombination and thus persister
survival. I will use gene conversion assays to measure homologous recombination in persisters with high DNA
content (1.1). I will then assess how DSB repair affects persister regrowth by tracking DSB repair using
fluorescent imaging and transcriptional reporters of the DNA damage response (1.2). In Aim 2, I will determine
the basis for DNA synthesis despite growth arrest including the requirements for initiation of DNA synthesis and
intramacrophage conditions that trigger this atypical DNA synthesis. I will determine the requirements for
initiation of chromosome replication at oriC through minichromosome replication assays (2.1). I will assess the
macrophage triggers for atypical DNA replication by evaluating DNA accumulation of persisters in genetically-
altered macrophages (2.2). Altogether, this research will further our understanding of intracellular persisters
including formation, maintenance of the persistent state, and re-growth. Mechanistic understanding of persister
survival will ultimately contribute to the development of approaches for targeting persisters, enhancing antibiotic
efficacy, and preventing the development of antibiotic resistance."
10848427,"Existing neurotechnologies continue to make significant clinical impact, but challenges remain for scientists and engineers in moving new devices from the bench to the bedside. Over the past two years (through an R25 grant), we developed a comprehensive, freely-available online short course on neurotechnology translation and commercialization called the NeuroTech Course featuring 20 self-paced video lectures from a diverse and experienced group of program faculty, topical questions, and a growing catalog of online resources for more advanced learning. These short-course video lectures cover preclinical model systems, safety and efficacy studies, good laboratory practices, device testing, quality system processes, regulatory agency interactions, steps in developing an investigational device exemption (IDE) application, reimbursement agency interactions, clinical trial design with an emphasis on quantitative outcome measures of target engagement, bioethical considerations that are specific to neural medical devices, techniques for securing strong intellectual property claims, funding opportunities available for technology development and clinical trials, and advice on moving neurotechnology into successful commercial ventures. With this grant, we propose to significantly amplify this course by (1) creating virtual “sprints” in which program faculty guide participant cohorts through the online lectures (to maximize adherence to the curriculum and enable participants to ask follow-up questions along the way). These online “sprints” will then be coupled with a (2) 3-day hands-on workshop (in person and virtual options) in which participants will work with program faculty to review case studies; discuss best practices through a series of intensive exercises taking a clinical need through the innovation process; and be mentored through the development of their own plans. The course will target senior postdoc scholars; academic and clinical faculty; and start-up company scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs who are preparing to develop research grant proposals with a clinical component. This course will serve as an important bridge for early-stage entrepreneurs to be successful in moving to later-stage programs, including NIH C3i, NSF I-Corps, incubators, and accelerators."
10906092,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) lungs exhibit mucoinflammatory responses soon after birth, likely triggered by viral
infections and/or aspiration. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes bronchiolitis leading to airway muco-
obstruction in young CF children, who exhibit increases in MUC5B and MUC5AC mucins in their airways.
Because no treatments are available for CF airway mucus overproduction, there is a clear unmet medical need
for therapies that target mucin synthesis in CF airways. CF airway epithelial inflammation triggers endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress and activates the inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), which exists in two isoforms, α and
β. IRE1α is ubiquitous, but IRE1β is only expressed in mucous cells of the respiratory and GI tracts. We have
shown that IRE1β (but not IRE1α) is required for airway mucin production. IRE1 is an ER transmembrane protein
with a lumenal domain (sensor of unfolded proteins) and a cytoplasmic domain (effector) with kinase and RNase
activities. It is unknown whether the IRE1 lumenal domain senses unfolded mucins and whether its cytoplasmic
domains mediate mucin production; however, our previous studies suggested that mucin production triggers ER
stress and activates IRE1β kinase-induced RNase activation. Because the activated IRE1 RNase splices the
mRNA of X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1s), a transcription factor that up-regulates mucin production, this may
provide a mechanism for CF airway epithelial mucin overproduction. In non-mucous cells, IRE1 kinase activates
JNK, p38 MAP kinase and NF-B via protein interactions, but it is unknown whether the IRE1 kinase activates
these pathways, which are relevant to CF airways because they can promote mucin production. Our preliminary
data indicate that IRE1β, MUC5AC and MUC5B levels are up-regulated in native CF human airways and in
freshly isolated CF human distal airway epithelia. Over-expression of wild type IRE1 in primary human bronchial
epithelia (HBE) increased mucin production, whereas over-expression of IRE1 mutants that lack kinase and/or
RNase activities decreased mucin production. IL-1 and TNF, predominant CF airway cytokines, differently
affected XBP-1s (only IL-1 increased XBP-1s) and mucin production (IL-1 > TNF) in HBE, suggesting that
they up-regulate mucin production via IRE1β RNase-dependent and independent mechanisms. KIRA6, an IRE1
kinase + RNase inhibitor, blunted IL-1-increased XBP-1s and mucins in CF HBE. Notably, a combination of
CFTR modulators (VX-445, VX-661 and VX-770) had no effect on mucin production. RSV infection of HBE
increased XBP-1s and mucin production/secretion, and these responses were blunted by KIRA6. Finally, murine
parainfluenza virus type 1-infected mice developed viral bronchiolitis and airway muco-obstruction, modeling the
bronchiolitis in CF infants infected by RSV. Our aims will test the role of IRE1β protein domains in CF airway
cytokine-increased mucin production in CF HBE. We will also evaluate the therapeutic effect of IRE1β inhibition
on respiratory virus infection-induced mucin production in CF HBE and murine airways, including a CF mouse.
Our studies may lead to the generation of IRE1β inhibitors as novel therapeutics for CF airway muco-obstruction."
10813126,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 With no universal cure, development of an effective vaccine to prevent HIV-1 infection remains a primary
goal. A major hurdle for the development of successful vaccination strategies has been the lack of affordable,
accessible, tractable, and relevant preclinical model systems. Investigations on HIV infection, pathogenesis, and
prevention using small animal models have been limiting due to the species-specific tropism of HIV. The advent
of immunodeficient mice harboring a human immune system (HIS) in many ways has broadened accessibility
and interest in HIV-related translational studies including viral replication, T cell depletion, methods of
transmission, and evaluation of antiretroviral therapies. Nevertheless, efforts to develop vaccination strategies
against HIV in current HIS mice have been thwarted due to poor adaptive immune responses and antigen-
specific antibody development following immunization. Thus, there is a great need for advances in HIS mice that
promote vaccine-mediated antibody development to specific epitopes that would easily translate to humans. We
hypothesize that enhanced human T cell function and priming via human antigen presenting cells in HIS mice
will facilitate efficient T/B cell interactions and enable evaluation of vaccination strategies against HIV-1. To this
end, we have developed a novel HIS mouse strain expressing human leukocyte antigens (HLA)-DQ and HLA-A
in the absence of murine major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I/II (to ensure human T cell selection on a
more appropriate molecules in the mouse thymus) in combination with human CSF1 knocked into the murine
Csf1 locus. Based on published data from our group and others, this novel strain, we anticipate, will support
improved T cell development/function as well as the development of human myeloid cells with increased capacity
to prime human T cells following immunization and facilitate HIV-1-specific antibody production. We will leverage
this new translational HIS platform to: i) Determine the scope of the human adaptive immune response to
infection with HIV-1 R5 virus, ii) Determine the neutralization ability of, define the Env epitopes targeted by, and
delineate the sequence features for the human adaptive immune response to HIV-1 immunization, and iii)
assess a novel vaccination strategy using optimized multivalent immunogens for broad neutralizing antibodies
(bNAb) elicitation. Together, these results will provide critical insights into the utility of this advanced HIS model

 Substance use disorders (SUDs) continue to be one of the most serious public health problems in the US.1
Studies have consistently documented a substantially higher prevalence of SUDs among adults under justice
supervision in the community (i.e., probation/parole) as compared to the general population.2-4 Continuing care
initiatives for individuals with SUDs have gained increased attention with the recognition that substance use
treatment requires long-term care.15, 46, 47, 54-58 Studies show that continuing care interventions can provide
ongoing support or extend primary treatment gains with respect to reductions in substance use, relapse, and
criminal activity.12, 52, 55, 56, 61-63 Recent diffusion of Internet and smartphone technologies among disadvantaged
populations now offers unprecedented opportunities for increasing access to quality continuing care interventions
as well as chronic disease self-management tools. Probationers and parolees at high risk for drug abuse relapse
and involvement in health compromising behaviors are an important population that stands to benefit from
continuing care technologies.
 Building on our team’s extensive experience in the fields of criminology and substance use, we propose to
finalize the development of a Continuing Care mobile application (app) by enhancing app capabilities and
conducting a randomized controlled trial to assess its effectiveness among clients on probation or parole who
are enrolled in outpatient substance use treatment. The app is designed to meet the recovery and personal
support needs of probationers and parolees with SUDs who are at elevated risk of relapse, treatment
discontinuation, re-arrest, and incarceration. It is guided by the principles of the transtheoretical model of
behavior change,24 and app content is derived from the Your Own Reintegration System (YOURS) program,25
an empirically-supported26 intervention that focuses on substance use recovery, reducing criminal thinking and
behavior, and cultivating support systems. If proven to be effective, the CC app could be deployed across the
national network of outpatient treatment providers and be highly significant in its direct impact on public health."
10815866,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Latently infected CD4+ T cells harboring integrated and replication-competent HIV genomes persist during ART
and are the main obstacle to HIV eradication. In most people with HIV (PWH), the reservoir is extremely stable
with a half-life of over 3 years. All prior attempts to significantly reduce its size or accelerate its decay have failed.
Using samples from participants in the MERLIN clade B primary HIV infection cohort (Lima, Peru), we observed
5 to 10-times faster decay of the HIV reservoir in individuals initiating ART during the first 3 months of infection
compared to those randomized to start ART later, suggesting that HIV-infected cells in people treated early are
more susceptible to elimination. Differences in the half-life of the reservoir, which are maintained during at least
the first 4 years of ART, offer a unique opportunity to identify mechanisms that could be harnessed to reduce the
reservoir in all PWH on ART. In this project, we propose to unravel the cellular and viral features responsible for
the rapid clearance or long-term persistence of individual HIV reservoir cells. We will test the hypothesis that the
capacity of reservoir cells to persist for prolonged periods is driven by a combination of cellular and viral features,
which differ between early and late treated individuals and result in differential reservoir decay. We will take
advantage of the unique MERLIN cohort to study HIV reservoir cells in 12 participants who initiated ART less
than 3 months after HIV acquisition (early ART: rapid decay) and 12 participants who deferred treatment for 6
months (late ART: slow decay). We will study the early, intermediate and late reservoirs, using cryopreserved
leukaphereses (collected at 1 & 2-3 years of ART) and newly collected leukapheresis from the same continually-
suppressed participants at >7 years of ART. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that intrinsic cellular features
of HIV reservoir cells underlie differences in reservoir decay. We will employ a single cell approach to identify
pro-survival factors associated with reservoir stability (Bcl-2, TCF-1, FOXO3A etc.) or that may protect infected
cells from immune clearance (ligands of immune checkpoint molecules, Serpin B9, TGF-β). We will also evaluate
the clonality of the reservoir with the hypothesis that clonal expansions of intact genomes will be more common
in late treated participants. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that specific viral characteristics also contribute
to the persistence of HIV-infected cells and will be gradually enriched over time on ART. To determine if specific
viruses are selected against during therapy, we will use an assay that couples integration site sequencing with
HIV transcription assessment, to determine the proportion of reservoir cells that are transcriptionally active. We
will use a novel approach to reconstruct molecular viral clones from the latent reservoir, and will measure the
fitness of these viruses and functionally assess their HIV proteomes. In this way, we will determine if the reservoir
is gradually enriched in proviruses encoding functional Nef and Vpu, which cause escape of antigen presentation
and impede CTL-mediated killing as well as neutralization and ADCC by autologous antibodies. Results from
this study will identify cellular and viral mechanisms that can be targeted to accelerate decay of the HIV reservoir."

 The proposed training program aims to provide professional training through academic curricula, research
experiences, and continuing education courses in industrial hygiene and environmental health sciences to
graduate students and industrial hygienists in the Southern California region, and to recruit diverse
undergraduate and graduate students to join the graduate school pursuing master and doctoral studies in
occupational and environmental health sciences related fields. The Southern California Superfund Research
Program (SCSRP) will build on the strong educational and research environments at the University of California
Los Angeles (UCLA) and the well-established UCLA Industrial Hygiene and Environmental Health and Sciences
(EHS) programs to develop a modern and multidisciplinary training program for students and the community of
industrial hygienists. Our mission is to prepare next-generation professionals for effective management of
stressors caused by emerging technologies such as nanotechnology. Our multidisciplinary team includes the
highly diverse faculty members and student population at UCLA, UC Irvine (UCI) and California State University
Fullerton (CSUF) and Long Beach (CSULB). Our faculty team has a proven track record in mentoring students
with a combined total of more than 350 trained graduate and undergraduate students and postdoctoral fellows.
Our team consists of industrial hygienists, environmental scientists, population health experts and community
partners. Our training will focus on occupational exposures and effects, digital learning techniques, practices and
protection guidance regarding engineered nanomaterials, emerging infectious agents, and nanotechnology-
enabled products including consumer electronic products and their related waste to be managed at the
generation and disposal stages. It is essential to provide proper training on the hazards of exposure to new
materials used in emerging and rapidly changing technologies and their effective control strategies for workers,
industrial hygienists, and the students, who will make up the future workforce. Our program broadens the scope
of current educational approaches with new and unique training regarding emerging technologies which are
unavailable in our other existing training programs. We anticipate training 6, 7 and 8 graduate students in years
1, 2, and 3-5 respectively. This includes 2-3 nine-month trainees and 4-5 summer trainees per year. We also will
recruit a diverse population of undergraduate students, with openings to 4-5 students per year with the 5-day
training workshop. During the five-year program period, we anticipate providing 37 training positions for master
and doctoral students; and for undergraduate students, providing them with 24 training opportunities in the 5-
day workshop in the hopes of future recruitment into graduate school. We will also train more than 100 industrial
hygiene professionals through the continuing education courses. Upon completion of our program, participants
will be well-trained industrial hygienists influential in the next generation workforce. These outcomes will aid the
expansion of the existing educational programs in industrial hygiene and environmental health sciences."
10895504,"Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) impacts an estimated 17.3 million adult Americans per year, which places
an enormous burden on the affected individuals as well as our healthcare system. An understudied but
pernicious component of depression is its harmful impact on people’s ability to remember happy events. If we
gained a clear understanding of neural processes that underly this positive memory deficit, we would be better
equipped to alleviate this disruption. A promising model of this memory deficit posits that encoding of positive
memories is weakened by depression because of dampened dopaminergic (DA) bursts that typically help
encode positive information (Dillon & Pizzagalli, 2018). Furthermore, pleasant events might not effectively
translate into long-term memory storage (and consequently be harder to retrieve) because of their incongruity
with depressed individuals’ dysphoric mood. The goals of the current proposal are to use Event-Related-
Potentials (ERPs) and computational modeling to test and extend this model by determining whether positive
mood induction (via mirth) can alleviate the positive memory deficit in individuals with MDD. The PI will evoke a
P300 ERP in adult participants (96 MDD and 96 Healthy Controls; HCs) during a memory encoding task and
examine whether its amplitude (i.e. strength of neural response) relates to participants’ diagnosis and memory
performance. All subjects will complete a clinical interview on day 1 (Session 1), complete a positive mood
induction (or a control task) and encode 120 pictures day 2 (Session 2). On day 3, following 24-hours to allow
for memory consolidation, participants will complete a memory recognition test (Session 3). P300 ERP will be
triggered in response to positive, negative, and neutral images during memory encoding, by presenting these
pictures at an infrequent (9%) rate intermixed with squares (91% rate). This design will allow us to measure
whether P300 amplitude (which signals DA mediated prediction errors) is lowed in participants with MDD,
relative to HCs, when they encode positive pictures (Aim 1). We will also apply the Hierarchical Drift Diffusion
Model to memory recognition data, in order to test the prediction that adults with MDD will exhibit slower
evidence accumulation (thus, impaired memory reconstruction) as they retrieve positive images, in contrast to
HCs (Aim 2). Finally, we will test the prediction that a mirth induction will raise positive affect, boost P300
responses to positive pictures, and reduce the positive memory deficit in adults with MDD (Aim 3). By
completing this project, the PI will obtain excellent training in applying electroencephalography (EEG),
computational modeling, and mood induction techniques towards translational research. This training will build
on the PI’s expertise in structural neuroimaging and enable him to conduct more clinically impactful research.
McLean Hospital will provide the PI with a world-class environment for conducting this study, with full support
for the PI’s training. Completion of this project and training will ultimately enable the PI to accomplish his goal
of becoming a leader in translational research with a focus on alterations in positive affect."
10894641,"Uveal melanoma (UM) is a highly aggressive and frequently fatal cancer of the eye. While only 2-4% of
patients will have detectable metastases at diagnosis, up to 50% of patients later develop metastatic disease,
overwhelmingly localized to the liver. Gene expression profiling separates UM to into two sub-groups, low risk
Class 1 UM and high risk Class 2 UM. Almost all UMs harbor an initiating mutation in the Gαq signaling
pathway, most commonly in GNAQ. Class 2 UMs harbor “progression mutations” in one of several genes that
drive tumor progression, the most common being BAP1. Previous studies from our group identified biallelic
inactivation of BAP1 as the strongest predictor of liver metastasis in UM. However, the cellular and molecular
mechanisms underlying liver metastasis in UM remain undetermined. This gap in our knowledge limits our
ability to develop effective adjuvant treatment for high risk patients and systemic treatments for disseminated
disease.
Gαq signaling activates the MAPK pathway in UM cells, and our preliminary single cell data show that Gαq-
mutant UMs are enriched for FOS/JUN transcriptional states. Loss of BAP1 function was associated with
escape from senescence, and a de-differentiated phenotype in UM cells that allowed their interaction with
hepatic stellate cells, leading to progression of liver metastases and drug resistance. The dedifferentiated state
of UM cells was specifically dependent on HDAC1, with HDAC inhibition restoring the differentiated state of
UM cells, and increasing the efficacy of MEK inhibition in UM liver metastasis models. The overarching goal of
this grant is to define the mechanism by which mutant Gαq and BAP1 loss co-operate to drive UM liver
metastasis development. In Aim 1 we will define how BAP1 loss alters the signaling, transcriptional and
epigenetic state of Gαq-mutant UM cells to allow senescence to be overcome. In Aim 2, we will address how
the cellular state of Gαq-mutant/BAP1-loss UM activates hepatic stellate cells to generate a pro-survival niche
in the liver through increased angiogenesis and upregulation of MAPK signaling. In Aim 3, we will explore the
HDAC1 dependency of the Gαq-BAP1 loss UM cell state and will validate hits from recent CRISPR screens to
identify novel therapeutic approaches to treat UM liver metastases, that we will validate in animal models. At
completion of this study, we expect to have defined new approaches to prevent and treat UM liver metastases,
that we will explore in clinical trials."
10908320,"Project Summary/Abstract
Pain is a common, and unwelcome aftermath of seeing the dentist. Indeed, pain has been deemed the fifth
vital sign and many describe it as an adverse event (AE). After the effects of the most commonly-used local
anesthetic diminishes, dental patients must rely on themselves and their own understanding for pain
management following dental procedures. This has led to an over-reliance on prescribed opioids as there are
no means to actively track patients' pain once they leave the clinic. To understand effective/appropriate pain
management, we need to examine the pain levels experienced by patients caused by which dental procedures.
Such an inventory will allow providers to anticipate and better manage their patients' post-operative pain.
 Innovative mobile applications and connected health technologies that allow real-time tracking of
patients' symptoms, functional status and quality of life, provide healthcare professionals with data that were
previously unavailable, and have fostered patient engagement, shared decision-making and adherence to
treatment plans. We propose to explore an innovative solution to dental pain monitoring and management by
implementing mobile phone technology to monitor patients' pain during the critical acute post-operative phase.
 We believe that by tracking patient reported outcomes (PROs) using mobile phones, patients with sub-
optimal pain experiences will be easily identified. This study will demonstrate that PROs provide actionable
data. This study can also serve as a model for implementing new health IT (mHealth) within dental practices to
improve patient engagement.
 This observational study will be conducted at NDPBRN (Dental Practice-based Research Network)
sites, which we believe are ideal for the development of this practical and focused post-operative pain
management study. We will recruit 50 NDPBRN practices and 4050 patients who will receive push notifications
through text messages using FollowApp.Care on their mobile phones at designated time intervals following
their dental procedure. This innovative approach of implementing an existing and tested mHealth system
technology (FollowApp.Care) into the real-world dental office setting of the NDPBRN will actively track pain
and other complications following dental procedures. By patients using their mobile phones, we expect to
promptly and precisely identify specific levels of pain for surgical dental procedures.
 During the UG3 phase of the study (Yr 1-2) we will develop all study materials in UG3-Aim1, and in
UG3-Aim 2 develop the design features and workflow for implementation of the study. During the UH3 phase
(Yr 3-6) we will in UH3-Aim1, pilot test procedures to streamline data collection and workflow in the NDPBRN
dental office. In UH3- Aim 2 we will assess post-operative pain intensity by procedure type; in UH3-Aim 3 we
will assess provider and patient post-op management strategies and in UH3-Aim 4, we will evaluate patients'
and providers' acceptance of the mHealth technology."

overall administration and coordination of the Biomedical Research Cores, Pilot & Feasibility Program, and
Enrichment Program. The Administrative Core is directed by Drs. Bedwell (P30 Director) Birket, and Solomon
(Associate Directors), along with continued involvement from Dr. Rowe (Associate Director) that additionally
serves to assure a seamless partnership with initiatives from the CF Foundation. Dr. Guimbellot will serve as
Co-Director of the Enrichment Program with Dr. Birket. Under this leadership, with assistance from the
experienced Research Management and Administrative Team (including Mr. Jeffrey Allison, Center
Administrative Director, and Dr. Emily Falk-Libby, Program Director-Scientific Affairs), the Core will continue to
successfully support CF Center goals in the upcoming funding cycle by: 1) Establishing the overall scientific
direction of the UAB P30 CF Center and ensuring continued contributions and growth into the most relevant
disease areas, including application of genetic therapies (e.g., directing communications between the
Administrative Core, P30 investigators, members of the Center’s active Internal Advisory Board, and/or
external consultants on its External Advisory Board to review Center activities and identify research directions
and opportunities), 2) Facilitating the objectives of all P30 components (e.g., prioritizing Core resources and
new equipment acquisition for optimal utilization, overseeing new state-of-the-art Core research space and
facilities, coordinating training and professional development activities, maintaining a Center website,
overseeing membership, building the Biomedical Core research base and monitoring its productivity,
supporting internal and external collaborations, managing successful operations in COVID-19), and 3)

its established, robust mechanisms for solicitation, review, and oversight of P30 pilot applications to foster new
and important contributions to CF science. Overall, it is the goal of the Administrative Core to optimally
promote synergy and progress within the CF P30 Center."
10918166,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT: P30 CORE A
Well-differentiated human airway epithelial cells, model systems, and the assays that can be used with them
are an instrumental model for understanding epithelial biology and are highly predictive of in vivo results in
clinical trials. Primary cells can be used with methodologies that translate readily to assays of airway and
epithelilal function in vivo, including measures of CFTR activity or other ion transporters, airway surface liquid
depth and mucus hydration, mucus viscosity and transport. epithelial cell models further provide an excellent
model for examining the biology of airway epithelial inflammation, which is key to the pathogenesis of cystic
fibrosis (CF) lung disease. The purpose of Core A is to support the research of numerous P30 investigators
that involves cell culture systems and to assist with established and innovative assays available to characterize
cellular responses.
Core A carries out three main functions as outlined in the Specific Aims. First, Core A procures (via interactions
for clinical acquisition of samples via Core C), grows, and distributes well-differentiated primary human
epithelial cells from a variety of tissue sources (lung, sinus, rectal, etc.) from CF and non-CF donors. This
includes samples of cells from lung transplants, surgically excised nasal tissue, rectal biopsies, and nasal
brushings obtained at UAB and from a large array of collaborating centers. Examination of novel expansion
and differentiation techniques for primary cells is also a key function of the Core. Second, Core A conducts
functional anatomic imaging of airway epithelia by 1-micron resolution Optical Coherence Tomography (μOCT)
in vitro (primary cells of human or non-human origin) and ex vivo (intact full-thickness trachea, mainstem
bronchi, and other tissues of human origin or comparable tissues from CF animal models, thus interfacing with
Core B). μOCT allows for investigators to explore mucus flow and mucociliary interactions and is designated
as a National Core due to its unique and important capabilities. Third, Core A performs and assists with
measures of CFTR activity and expression. In addition to traditional assays of CFTR function (e.g, Ussing
chambers), the Core supports innovative conductance assays, organoid swelling assays, and advanced PCR
technology for investigating CFTR and other protein expression.
Core A facilitates interdisciplinary collaborative research, provides resources that are beyond the expertise of
individual research laboratories, fosters the sharing of ideas and experimental strategies, assists with technical
troubleshooting, and maintains essential equipment that is and will be heavily utilized by P30 personnel and
beyond. Cost savings are achieved by minimizing duplicate efforts of individual CF investigators, by the
centralized purchase and usage of equipment, reagents, and supplies, as well as by maintaining a central
repository for human epithelial tissue. On the whole, Core A provides significant expertise and resources to
aid P30 investigators, fostering advancement of epithelial cell culture and innovative assays to understand
CFTR pathogenesis and support rational drug discovery."
10918168,"Project Summary/Abstract
Animal models have become an increasingly valuable tool for biomedical research. Animal models are
particularly relevant to the understanding of cystic fibrosis (CF), where they are used extensively to
characterize CFTR expression and function and investigate the pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis. Furthermore,
animal models are critical to evaluating the effectiveness of novel therapies. The purpose of Core B is to
support the research of numerous P30 investigators that involves animal models, and the innovative assays
available to characterize them.
Core B carries out three main functions as outlined in the Specific Aims. First, Core B breeds, genotypes, and
distributes diverse CF relevant animal models. It provides CF models of mouse, rat, ferret and pig to dozens of
local, national, and international P30 investigators. Second, the Core aids in the generation and procurement
of relevant animal models required by P30 investigators. The Core helps generate new animal models using
cutting edge recombinant technology, including the novel rat model centered at UAB and more recently
humanized versions of this species (designated a National Core Resource). In addition, the Core acquires
available animals needed by P30 investigators, such as the CF ferret and pig models. In this way, the Core
helps investigators develop and characterize innovative animal models that can be used to expand the current
body of CF research. Third, Core B has developed numerous endpoint measures to assess CFTR function,
epithelial physiology, preclinical endpoints, and biospecimen analysis in CF animal models. The endpoint
assays conducted by the core include: extensive CFTR physiological outcome measures; assays of epithelial
function; state-of-the-art imaging modalities of the GI and respiratory tract (including ultrasound, micro-CT, and
micro-optical coherence tomography (a second National Resource, see Core A); physiological assays such as
Flexivent lung function, plethysmography, and cough monitoring; survival bronchoscopy; and techniques for
drug delivery and monitoring. These cutting-edge endpoint analyses supported by Core B help to uncover
disease mechanisms and pathways, and to elucidate clinically relevant findings.
Core B provides significant resources and technical expertise that greatly augment efforts of P30 investigators.
The efforts put forth by Core B foster the sharing of ideas and promote collaboration among investigators.
Furthermore, the Core contributes to significant cost savings by providing animal models, electrophysiologic
equipment, expensive imaging modalities, small animal bronchoscopy and tissue/specimen processing, and
resources that are shared among many investigators without the need to duplicate the same capabilities in
multiple laboratories. In these ways, P30 Core B is indispensable for the research priorities delineated by the
overall UAB P30, including studies of CFTR cellular biology, tissue pathogenesis, and clinical translation."
10918172,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The UAB P30 Research and Translation Core Center consolidates a large number of externally funded cystic
fibrosis (CF) research programs on our campus, building an innovative environment to pursue, advance, and
train in CF-related science. During the last funding period, the P30 made robust and important contributions to
multiple UAB laboratories of our Research Base of over 70 investigators pursuing research relevant to CFTR
modulation; CF pathogenesis; novel outcome measures for the genetic therapy era; infection and inflammation
in the context of highly effective modulator therapy; and therapeutic translation for untreated CFTR mutations.
By virtue of the NIH Center, translational research at our Institution has continued to accelerate in the past five
years, as has the breadth of investigators. The richness of CF basic science at UAB has grown in parallel with
this translational expansion, providing numerous opportunities to exploit in the next funding period, and the
Center is strategically structured to take advantage of these opportunities.
The P30 Center has allowed investigators at UAB and collaborating sites to improve understanding of CF
disease mechanism and has furnished novel opportunities to aggressively apply this information towards
experimental therapeutics, including genetic-based therapies that will continue to grow in emphasis. This NIH
Center includes three Biomedical Research Cores that help to organize efforts of CF faculty towards the
common and essential goal of helping individuals with CF and to train the next generation of CF leaders. The
Cores include: Core A: Cell Model and Assay Core (GM Solomon and J Guimbellot, Co-PIs); Core B: Animal
Models Core (DM Bedwell and S Birket, Co-PIs); and Core C: Clinical and Translational Core (SM Rowe and A
Gaggar, Co-PIs). Each Core provides leading-edge assays, specialized reagents and techniques, and valued
expertise. The P30 has also engaged new investigators through a Pilot and Feasibility mechanism integral to
Center vitality and has a tight integration with the UAB Center for Clinical and Translational Science, enabling a
robust training environment. In addition to providing a platform from which junior and senior scientists are
brought into the field, Pilot Projects serve as a means of rapidly testing exciting advances, particularly from the
perspective of clinical translation. Two Pilot and Feasibility Projects are in progress: Project 1: R Patel, PI.
“Erythrocyte Hemolysis and Lung Disease in CF”; and Project 2: E Plaisance, PI. “Ketone Monoester
Supplementation in CF: A Pilot and Feasibility Study”, capitalizing on the next era of innovative opportunities to
transform the disease. Through these scientific initiatives, the P30 has added value to a collaborative
environment for CF research at our Institution, and is well-positioned to continue in this capacity in the future,
with a major focus on therapeutic translation."

Project Title: Comparative Safety of Seizure Prophylaxis within the Medicare Program
1R01AG073410-01
Each year thousands of Medicare beneficiaries with Alzheimer’s disease and/or Alzheimer’s-related dementias (AD/ADRD) receive anticonvulsant drugs for seizure prophylaxis. These drugs are life-saving given the severity of seizure sequalae, but also life-threatening because of serious adverse events. Patients with AD/ADRD are particularly vulnerable given their high susceptibility to both stroke and adverse events. The decision to start and stop anticonvulsants also might change when the patient have AD/ADRD, in part because anticonvulsant therapy management becomes more complex when patients have difficulty with therapy having a narrow therapeutic range or difficulty recognizing early complication symptoms. There are no trial data to guide decisions about prophylaxis after an ischemic stroke among patients with or without AD/ADRD. The sparse and conflicted existing literature has been limited by the difficulty assessing relevant measures, e.g., stroke severity or AD/ADRD status, in claims. Medicare claims offer potential, but lack well-validated definitions for stroke severity, AD/ADRD status, seizures, or adverse effects. We will address these issues using a novel dataset with individual-level linked longitudinal information from registries, electronic health records, and Medicare claims, and will develop prediction models for key baseline and outcome variables. Then, using a random 20% sample of national traditional, fee-for-service Medicare claims over 18 years (2006-23), we will emulate clinical trials assessing two critical decisions in the setting of first mild to moderate ischemic stroke among patients with or without AD/ADRD: a) initiating outpatient prophylaxis versus not; and b) stopping prophylaxis at six months versus continuing. We will apply multiple analytical tools to address confounding and other challenges. We will stratify our population based on AD/ADRD status because the patterns of strokes, post-stroke seizures, and treatment complications differ among patients with compared to those without AD/ADRD, as could the clinical management patterns. We have three aims: 1) To validate claims-based prediction models for our study variables; 2) To emulate a clinical trial comparing outpatient prophylaxis initiation versus not; and 3) To emulate a clinical trial comparing stopping outpatient prophylaxis at six months versus continuing. This comparative safety study could inform future policy and clinical care and improve stroke and AD/ADRD care, e.g., through adjustments in Medicare quality incentives and clinical guidelines. Moreover, these data could help inform patients, families, clinicians, and policy makers about how we can improve care for patients who could require seizure prophylaxis."

neglect (CAN), and to facilitate dissemination of research and practice knowledge/skills to varied stakeholders.
The research utilizes a developmental psychopathology perspective, incorporating multiple methods within a
lifespan framework and implementation science approach. Exposure to CAN frequently results in long-term
detrimental effects on mental health. Disproportionate representation of Black youth in the Child Protective
Services (CPS) and child welfare system is associated with health disparities. For youth who have experienced
racial and ethnic marginalization, the trauma associated with CAN may be compounded by stress and trauma
deriving from experiences of racism, discrimination, and other forms of oppression. Interventions to address
racial stress for symptomatic youth receiving mental health services are lacking, and use of mental health
services that are acceptable to Black families are too often misaligned with their representation in the
population in general and overrepresentation in the child welfare system specifically. Incorporating support for
families in enhancing racial socialization and coping skills specific to addressing racial stress and trauma has
relevance for public health, where systemic racism is acknowledged as a core social determinant of health
posing a threat to public health. Engaging, Managing, and Bonding through Race (EMBRace) is an innovative,
culturally-relevant intervention for Black youth that addresses challenges associated with parenting Black
children and aims to promote more effective strategies for addressing racial encounters through building skills
in exploring racial socialization content, coping, and delivery. Although Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral
Therapy (TF-CBT) is an evidence-based treatment for children who have experienced CAN, determining best
practices for enhancing TF-CBT with racial socialization components is urgently needed to address these gaps
and provide optimal intervention for this population. A RE-AIM/PRISM framework (including Reach,
Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance with emphasis on contextual factors at multiple
levels of the implementation setting) will incorporate stakeholder perspectives and evaluate the combination of
EMBRace and TF-CBT, while identifying barriers and facilitators to implementation to guide future larger-scale
trials."

This is a proposal for a K24 Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research (POR) for Namratha
Kandula, MD, MPH of Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Dr. Kandula is Associate
Professor of Medicine and Preventive Medicine and co-Director of the Center for Community Health.
Dr. Kandula's scholarship is focused on understanding the social and cultural determinants of cardiovascular
disease (CVD) disparities in South Asian Americans and implementing evidence-based interventions (EBIs)
using community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods. South Asian Americans, the majority of whom
are immigrants, are disproportionately affected by CVD compared to non-Hispanic whites and other Asian
Americans. While there is ample evidence that intensive diet and physical activity interventions improve CVD
risk factors in adults, these EBIs have limited reach in South Asian and other vulnerable populations because
most EBIs were developed in narrow clinical populations, lack cultural salience, do not account for multilevel
social determinants of health, and are difficult to implement in new settings. Dr. Kandula has expertise in
epidemiologic studies and community-based lifestyle intervention trials and has been actively mentoring
students and junior investigators on health disparities and community engaged research. The objective of this
K24 application is to promote science and mentorship in community engaged implementation research to
optimally deliver and sustain EBIs focused on populations with a high burden of health disparities. Support
from the K24 will provide Dr. Kandula with protected time to: 1) Devote more time to mentoring a diverse group
of young investigators in community engaged implementation research; 2) Improve her implementation science
research and mentoring skills through mentor training and guidance from senior mentors; 3) Extend her
currently funded work to fill critical gaps in the science of delivering and sustaining EBIs for vulnerable
populations; and 4) Assume leadership in new multisector, collaborative research on how to optimally deliver
EBIs to eliminate health disparities. The current K24 proposal builds upon the scientific premise and extends
the research and mentorship of the PI in the context of her two NIH-funded, community engaged lifestyle
intervention trials to reduce CVD disparities in South Asian adults and adolescents (SAHELI and SAATH
trials). The PI and her mentees will use mixed methods to: 1) Investigate social and structural determinants
that contributed to differences in implementation outcomes of EBIs in the SAHELI and SAATH trials;
2) Evaluate sustainability of the EBIs implemented in the SAHELI and SAATH trials; and 3) Understand
stakeholder perspectives on which implementation outcomes and evaluation strategies are most meaningful
and feasible when implementing EBIs for CVD prevention in health disparity populations. Conduct of the
proposed Aims will accelerate science and mentorship in building sustainable community partnerships and
models to optimally deliver EBIs that improve the health of vulnerable populations and advance health equity."
10888356,"Summary of the Research Project: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a life-threatening disease with
no cure
characterized by severe lesions in the pulmonary vessels due to hyperproliferation of vascular cells,
including endothelial cells. The primary cause of these lesions is largely unknown, but several studies indicate
they result from chronic inflammation, such as that caused by Schistosoma mansoni infection. ~10 million people
infected with S. mansoni develop PAH (Sch-PAH). Thus, a better understanding of how the infection promotes
the formation of vascular lesions will provide insights for identifying novel molecular targets for PAH treatment.
Recently, we reported that endothelial cells that survive to chronic lung injury, show reduced expression of the
anti-proliferative scaffolding protein caveolin-1 (Cav-1) and elevated response to pro-fibrotic TGF-β signaling.
Activation of TGF-β requires recruitment of Th2 cells into the lungs, which in turn expands Cav-1 depleted
endothelial cells and promote PAH. Although it is unknown how Cav-1-depleted endothelial cells contribute to
Sch-PAH, our preliminary data indicate enhanced expression of inhibitor of apoptosis protein 2 (c-IAP2) may
participate in this process. In line with this observation, data suggest that S. mansoni-primed endothelial cells
retain in vitro a memory of the in vivo infection. Specifically, this memory is characterized by impaired function
of the death associated receptor P2X7, which is controlled by Cav-1 expression. Thus, I hypothesize that while
S. mansoni infection leads to lung endothelial cell death and secretion of c-IAP2, recipient cells generate a long-
lasting survival memory required for endothelial-immune cell crosstalk and the development of Sch-PAH.

Changing behavior of health providers can be challenging, and significant gaps exist in our knowledge of how
to best implement new medical evidence into everyday practice. Numerous individual- and system-level factors
contribute to poor asthma outcomes which persist due to the lack of a comprehensive approach for asthma
care that is scalable, sustainable, and widely disseminated. Improved asthma outcomes are associated with
effective communication strategies between the patient and provider. Shared decision making (SDM) is a
patient-centered process in which patients and providers work together to make decisions and select tests,
treatments, and care plans based on evidence that balances risks with patient preferences and values.
Previous studies, including our PCORI-funded dissemination study, have shown that SDM is associated with
improved outcomes for asthma patients in primary care. Here we will evaluate the implementation of Coach
McLungsSM, a virtual evidence-based asthma SDM intervention with built-in asthma education and clinical
decision support, into primary care practices across a large healthcare system. Atrium Health, the 2nd largest
virtually integrated healthcare system in the nation, with over 14 million patient visits per year and the region's
largest primary care network, provides an ideal venue to evaluate implementation into primary care. Coach
McLungsSM will be fully integrated into the electronic medical record at all primary care practices. All asthma
patients aged 5-17 who attend these practices will be assessed for uncontrolled asthma. The goal of this study
will be to evaluate the implementation of the Coach McLungsSM SDM intervention into primary care.
Implementation will be guided using the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC), a
compilation of implementation strategies, and evaluated using the RE-AIM (Reach Effectiveness, Adoption,
Implementation, Maintenance) framework. Research questions are: How best can we implement the Coach
McLungsSM SDM asthma intervention into primary care? Will use of Coach McLungsSM in primary care improve
outcomes for patients with uncontrolled asthma? After convening a Stakeholder Advisory Committee (SAC)
composed of providers, researchers, patients, stakeholders with expertise in implementation science, asthma
research and advocacy, we will implement the Coach McLungsSM SDM intervention into primary care practices
using a stepped wedge randomized control study design. Providers and staff will be trained in SDM
communication and use of the Coach McLungsSM tool. We will measure changes in emergency department
visits, hospitalizations, and oral steroid use, which serve as surrogate measures for patient-centered asthma
outcomes. The SAC will use an iterative process improvement method and give best practice
recommendations back to the practices for implementation improvement. We will disseminate findings through
local stakeholders, practice-based research networks, asthma advocacy national organizations, and academic
research meetings for healthcare, primary care, and asthma."

 Our overall goals are to understand how emergency myelopoiesis contributes to the pathogenesis of
myeloid malignancies, dissect the underlying metabolic and epigenetic mechanisms driving aberrant self-re-
newal and differentiation properties in malignant hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC), and identify
potential vulnerabilities to target therapeutically. At steady-state, blood production reflects the differential pro-
duction by rare quiescent hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) of a small number of myeloid-biased multipotent pro-
genitors (MPP2/3) and a large number of lymphoid-biased multipotent progenitors (MPP4), which both give rise
to granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMP) and contribute to limited myeloid output. In contrast, during re-
generation, activated HSCs overproduce myeloid-biased MPP2/3, lymphoid-biased MPP4 are reprogrammed
towards myelopoiesis, and GMP expand in the bone marrow (BM) cavity as GMP clusters (cGMP), driving burst
production of myeloid cells. This remodeling of the HSPC compartment reflects the engagement of emergency
myelopoiesis pathways, which are transiently activated during regeneration but are co-opted and constantly
triggered in myeloid malignancies such as myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). However, the regulatory mech-
anisms controlling emergency myelopoiesis remain poorly understood, and the relationships between leukemic
myelopoiesis, which is continuously fueled by pre-leukemic HSCs in MPNs, and regenerative myelopoiesis,
which is an acute stress response, are still largely unexplored. Furthermore, the role of emergency myelopoiesis
in the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where HSPC differentiation is blocked and leukemic stem
cells (LSC) emerges from transformed HSPCs, remains unknown. Our objective is to identify how HSPCs adapt
in these different situations and adjust both self-renewal and differentiation properties during regenerative and
leukemic myelopoiesis. In Aim 1, we will take advantage of our newly generated single-cell RNA sequencing
atlas of 5-fluorouracil (5FU)-mediated regeneration and Scl-tTA:TRE-BCR/ABL (BAtTA) MPN malignancy to iden-
tify changes in cell-state and differentiation trajectories driving activation of emergency myelopoiesis pathways.
In Aim 2, we will investigate the role of two key regulatory processes (metabolic adaptation and epigenetic
remodeling) in driving emergency myelopoiesis during regenerative and malignancy. In particular, we will test
the central role of the MYC transcription factor, the metabolite alpha-ketoglutarate (αKG) and the process of
glutaminolysis in remodeling the HSPC compartment. In Aim 3, we will test whether activation of emergency
myelopoiesis pathways cooperates with epigenetic driver mutations like TET2 loss in pre-leukemic HSCs to
promote clonal selection and LSC emergence from an expanded and remodeled HSPC compartment. Collec-
tively, these approaches will uncover the mechanisms driving emergency myelopoiesis that are critical for dis-
ease development, and provide new insights into the epigenetic and metabolic states associated with enhanced
myelopoiesis that could potentially be targeted for leukemia treatment."
10834176,"Unscheduled whole-genome doubling events (WGD) give rise to polyploid cells that are associated with human
disease. Most significantly, WGD generates genetically unstable tetraploid cells that can fuel tumorigenesis.
Recent computational analyses have revealed that nearly 40% of all solid tumors have undergone at least one
WGD, often early in their development, demonstrating that such events play significant roles in both the initiation

genetic adaptations that enable them to tolerate the numerous defects imparted by doubled DNA content, and
that these cells are therefore imparted with specific genetic dependencies that are not present in normal diploid
cells (i.e. ploidy-specific lethality). These hypotheses will be tested in three specific aims. Aim 1: Use an
innovative approach to rapidly quantitate the frequency and underlying cause of WGD in different tissues in vivo
and determine if this frequency is affected by aging. Aim 2: Validate KIF18A, which encodes for a mitotic kinesin,

gene amplifications/deletions) that are significantly and specifically enriched in whole genome-doubled tumors,
and mechanistically define how such alterations provide ploidy-specific growth advantages in vitro and in vivo.
Successful completion of these aims will provide significant insight into the genesis, biology, and evolution of

10893609,"Project Abstract
PDA is the most common neoplasm of the pancreas, and is soon to be the second most common cause of
cancer deaths in the United States. Surgical resection in Stage I/II patients provides the only opportunity for
cure, yet >80% of patients will recur and die of their disease within 2-3 years2. The statistics for Stage III and
Stage IV PDA are more dismal, having 12 and 6 month median overall survival times, respectively. Outside of
BRCA2 mutations that confer sensitivity to platinum salts or PARP inhibition, or immune checkpoint inhibitors
in patients with mismatch repair deficiency, there are few actionable targets in the PDA genome. Thus, it is
essential that novel strategies are developed to extend survival. One innovative way to do so is to “treat
evolution with evolution”. However, it is first imperative that we develop a deep understanding of PDA
evolutionary biology. Our efforts will be focused on three questions with clear mechanistic and translational
relevance to this ultimate goal. First, what are the features of clinically relevant intratumoral heterogeneity at
the genetic and transcriptional level? Second, how do cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous factors
influence the evolutionary dynamics of PDA? Third, how do PDA therapies influence evolutionary trajectories,
and can they be more effectively used within the evolutionary context of a tumor? We will rely on whole exome
or whole genome sequenced samples of primary and metastatic pancreatic cancer tissues, single cell
technologies for copy number alterations or RNA expression, long-term evolution experiments, mouse models
and computational models to address these questions. We aim to use the information gained over the period of
this work to develop metrics of heterogeneity that will inform clinical management, including identification of the
optimal agents and timing of administration based on the evolutionary context of the patients' PDA. Such
questions are of broad interest in cancer biology in general and have a strong likelihood to impact upon other
tumor types as well."
10894255,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Diabetes mellitus is associated with many complications, including increased infection risk. With diabetes, one
of the most common sites of infection is the urinary tract. In people with diabetes, urinary tract infection (UTI) is
more common and has worse outcomes. The mechanisms that predispose people with diabetes to UTI are not
defined. A greater appreciation for the host defense mechanisms that protect the urinary tract from microbial
insult is needed to develop new UTI prevention and treatment strategies. This application’s objective is to identify
how insulin signaling regulates innate immune defenses in the bladder. Our published and supporting data
demonstrate that bladder urothelial defenses are regulated by insulin-mediated targets, including peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), insulin receptor signaling, and histone deacetylase proteins.
Specifically, our data suggest PPARγ activation and histone deacetylase inhibition enhance insulin signaling,
strengthen the urothelial barrier, and enhance innate immunity, including the production of antimicrobial peptides
and the urothelial barrier. In contrast, silencing urothelial insulin receptor expression increases UTI susceptibility.
These data support our central hypothesis that insulin and insulin receptor signaling have key roles in activating
innate immune responses and regulating UTI host defense. Expanding upon these findings, we propose a
comprehensive analysis of insulin’s ability to regulate bladder urothelial defense mechanisms. Aim 1 will
determine the effects of progressive insulin resistance and diabetes on the bladder’s antibacterial defenses. We
will also investigate if activating PPARγ triggers insulin signaling to enhance immune defenses and reduce UTI
susceptibility. Aim 2 will interrogate the impact of insulin receptor signaling on the bladder’s immune defenses
and urothelial responses and repair to UTI. Aim 3 will define the effect of histone deacetylase proteins on insulin
signaling and the bladder’s immune defenses. Our long-term research goal is to identify why people with diabetes
have increased UTI risk and improve their care. By evaluating the role of insulin signaling in host defense, our
expected outcomes may have profound influence on human health as they may develop insulin-signaling targets
as new UTI therapeutics."
10873088,"Circadian disruption has been strongly associated with diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Recent human studies
implicate β-cell dysfunction as a potential mechanism underlying the increased risk for diabetes with circadian
disruption. It is, therefore, imperative to understand the interaction between the circadian clock and regulation of
β-cell function to prevent diabetes. We have shown previously that genetic disruption of the circadian clock, by
deletion of Bmal1, a non-redundant core clock gene, in mice, leads to β-cell failure and diabetes, secondary to
impaired glucose-stimulated ATP production, uncoupling and impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion
(GSIS). β-cells, normally, need to be “metabolically flexible” in being able to switch between substrates for energy
production. However, it is unknown if circadian clock regulates this metabolic flexibility in β-cells. Our preliminary
data suggests that circadian disruption, even for short periods, via an upregulation of Pdk (pyruvate
dehydrogenase kinase), restricts pyruvate entry into mitochondria for oxidation and induces metabolic
inflexibility, and impairment in glucose utilization by the pancreatic β-cells leading to diabetes. The overarching
hypothesis for this proposal is that the circadian clock orchestrates the metabolic pathways in β-cells to ensure
efficient stimulus-secretion coupling. New data from our lab indicates that circadian disruption leads to metabolic
inflexibility in the β-cell wherein it is unable to utilize glucose effectively. We hence hypothesize that circadian
disruption leads to impaired mitochondrial function resulting in impaired substrate utilization, metabolic
inflexibility leading to β-cell failure and diabetes. We will use environmental means to induce circadian disruption
in mice, complemented by inducible and β-cell specific genetic deletion and overexpression models of molecular
clock (Bmal1 and Rev-erb alpha) along with pharmacological and genetic modulation of the molecular clock and
the proposed target pathways including Pdk in human and mouse islets, to test mechanisms underlying the β-
cell failure seen with circadian disruption, especially as it relates to substrate oxidation. We will use
pharmacological interventions to target specific disrupted pathways to restore metabolic flexibility in circadian
disrupted β-cells. The specific aims of the proposal are: (1) To test if circadian disruption leads to mitochondrial
dysfunction and metabolic inflexibility in β-cells, using environmental and genetic circadian disruption models
and investigate if Rev-erb alpha-Pdk axis mediate the circadian regulation of substrate utilization in β-cells. (2)
To delineate circadian clock regulation of mitochondrial function in normal human β-cells and alteration in
diabetic state using loss-of and gain-of-function studies of the molecular clock in normal and diabetic human
islets. (3) Test targeted pharmacological interventions to reverse circadian disruption-induced β-cell
mitochondrial dysfunction. This proposal will decipher the underlying mechanisms of β-cell failure with circadian
disruption in mouse models, test their applicability in human islets and look at targeting specific pathways to
improve β-cell function that lead to therapies to prevent and treat diabetes."

10896146,"Cardiac toxicity is a devastating complication of cancer treatment and occurs during, shortly after, or even many
years after treatment. Long-term follow up of patients undergoing thoracic radiation, such as lymphoma, lung,
and esophageal cancers, has shown that in particular, radiation therapy (RT) can lead to major radiation-induced
cardiac toxicities like congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease. Typically, the standard of care for
cardiac dose assessment involves simple heart dose/volume metrics. However, mounting evidence suggests
that cardiac substructures contained within the heart are highly radiosensitive and dose to substructures
are more strongly associated with overall survival than assessing whole-heart dose/volume metrics.
Nevertheless, precise characterization of cardiac substructure dose in routine clinical practice is currently
limited because substructures are not visible on CT simulation scans used for RT planning, cardiac MRI are
not widely available for cancer patients, and manual delineation is cumbersome, taking 6-10 hours per case.
Further, precise localization is complicated by both cardiac and respiratory motion. Our long-term goal is to
develop and validate clinically viable novel technologies to localize cardiac substructures for novel cancer
therapies and interventions. The rationale for the proposed research is that by developing a robust and efficient
clinical framework for cardiac substructure dose assessment, more effective cardiac sparing strategies can be
achieved. Our expertise in deep learning coupled with experience in MR-guided RT has laid the groundwork for
this paradigm-changing proposal with the long-term goal of optimal cardiac sparing to ultimately reduce radiation-
induced cardiac toxicity. To attain the overall objectives, we propose the following specific aims: (i) develop
high quality, efficient cardiac substructure segmentation and accurate synthetic CT generation via deep learning,
(ii) quantify respiratory and cardiac-induced cardiac substructure motion using a novel 5D-MRI approach and
inter-fraction uncertainties to derive margins and planning strategies for robust cardiac sparing, and (iii) evaluate
the clinical efficacy of these emerging technologies in a randomized clinical trial for lung cancer evaluating
longitudinal changes in cardiac function from MRI, quality of life, echocardiogram, and blood biomarkers between
MR-guided adaptive radiation therapy with sparing and standard x-ray based treatment with whole-heart dose
metrics. This multi-disciplinary (oncology, cardiology, radiology, and computer science) proposal integrates state
of the art technologies while challenging the standard of care of using whole-heart dose evaluations. The
research proposed is innovative as it challenges the current, oversimplified classic model of whole-heart dose
estimates via several cutting-edge techniques. The research is significant because of its widespread application
in other thoracic cancers including lung, breast, lymphoma, esophageal, and future pediatric cancer trials.
Ultimately, the overall positive impact is that our pipeline will yield highly effective cardiac substructure sparing
to reduce radiation-related cardiac toxicities and maximize therapeutic gains."
10897722,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant internal modification on poly(A) RNA. Dynamic regulation of
the m6A epitranscriptome is involved in diverse cellular functions. m6A mediates these functions by affecting
mRNA translation, alternative splicing, nuclear export and degradation, and miRNA biogenesis and binding
through three groups of proteins: methyltransferases or “writers”, demethylases or “erasers”, and m6A-binding
proteins or “readers”. m6A is present in the genomes of RNA viruses and regulates the replication of these
viruses. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the etiologic agent of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and
primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) commonly found in AIDS patients. Understanding the mechanism regulating
KSHV latent and lytic replication can not only provide insights into the pathogenesis of KSHV-induced cancers
but also serve as the basis for developing novel therapy. In the current funding period, we have made
significant progresses toward this goal. For this renewal, we have discovered that m6A is abundant on KSHV
transcripts, and that m6A reader protein YTHDF2 acts as an antiviral factor during viral lytic replication. We
demonstrate m6A dynamics during KSHV latent and lytic replications, and in different cell types that support
distinct viral replication programs. Despite these works, the roles of m6A in KSHV infection have just started to
be revealed. The Objective of this application is to systematically map the dynamics of m6A modifications at a
single base resolution and bindings of m6A reader proteins in KSHV epitranscriptome, and determine their
functions in different phases of KSHV life cycle, and KSHV-induced tumorigenesis. The Central Hypothesis is
that KSHV m6A modifications are dynamically regulated, and these modifications mediate different phases of
KSHV life cycle, and hence KSHV-induced tumorigenesis. We will test this hypothesis by mapping m6A marks
in KSHV transcriptome at a single base resolution, and determine the roles of m6A writer and eraser proteins in
different phases of KSHV life cycle and KSHV-induced tumorigenesis (Aim 1); determining the functions of
m6A reader proteins in different phases of KSHV life cycle by gain- and loss-of-function approaches and by
examining their bindings to KSHV transcripts (Aim 2); and examining the functions of KSHV m6A marks in the
context of viral infection using Crispr-Cas9-guided m6A writer and eraser, and by site-specific mutagenesis
(Aim 3). It is our expectations that this project will provide comprehensive mapping and functional delineation
of m6A marks, and m6A writer, eraser and reader proteins in different phases of KSHV life cycle, and KSHV-
induced tumorigenesis. This work is highly significant as it will, for the first time, systematically reveal the
functions of these RNA modifications in KSHV infection, thus providing insights into the mechanism regulating
KSHV life cycle and KSHV-induced pathogenesis. This study will also identify potential prognostic markers and
therapeutic targets. The proposed work is highly innovative as it will use new technologies to map m6A marks
and bindings of m6A reader proteins, as well as directly manipulate m6A marks on key viral transcripts by
Crispr-Cas9-guided m6A writer and eraser, KSHV reverse genetics, and innovative tumor models.
Furthermore, the generated datasets, information and reagents will be valuable to the scientific community."
10821442,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an aggressive bile duct cancer. A majority of patients present with
advanced disease and die within a year. For these patients, chemotherapy is the main therapeutic option. Current
standards of care include gemcitabine-based regimens such as gemcitabine + cisplatin. However, the 5-year
survival rate has not been improved for several decades; tumors that respond initially become resistant, and
patients relapse. The literature documents that overexpression of DNA repair proteins contributes to resistance
to DNA damaging agents such as gemcitabine and cisplatin, current frontline agents for CCA. This proposal
seeks to identify gemcitabine-based combinations that overcome drug resistance and produce durable
remissions for patients with CCA.
 To identify effective regimens and characterize molecular events that contribute to chemosensitivity or
resistance, we developed a panel of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) CCA models: CCA1-5 and gemcitabine-
resistant counterparts of CCA1 and CCA2 (CCA1.gemR and CCA2.gemR), with resistance acquired in vivo. We
propose to use these models to identify effective treatments for CCA. Our data support the hypothesis that
gemcitabine + a BET inhibitor (BETi) + a PARP inhibitor (PARPi) comprises effective treatment for this tumor
type. Bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) proteins regulate the association of transcription
complexes to acetylated lysine residues of histones at specific chromosomal loci. BETi decrease expression of
genes whose expression is BET-dependent. Multiple BETi are in clinical trial.
 Our data demonstrate: 1) that BETi + PARPi and also that BETi + gemcitabine are synergistic in vitro; 2)
the novel finding that gemR cells are more sensitive to BETi + PARPi than to gemcitabine + cisplatin; and 3) that
the BETi JQ1 + gemcitabine was more effective than gemcitabine as a single agent in the CCA1.gemR PDX in
vivo model (P<0.001). Further, our data suggest that sequential administration of BETi → gemcitabine will
produce BETi-mediated decreases in expression of DNA repair proteins and minimize gemcitabine resistance.
 Proposed work evaluates the anti-tumor efficacy of the clinical BETi OTX015 + the PARPi olaparib +
gemcitabine, cisplatin, or gemcitabine + cisplatin in models of local and metastatic CCA. We will determine if
any of these regimens is superior to current standard of care, and perform whole genome sequencing of all
models to identify genetic and molecular characteristics associated with resistance. We will also generate
expression profiles of treated vs control tumors and of primary vs metastatic tumors. These data will provide a
basis for future work toward long-term goals of identifying gene products and pathways that contribute to drug
resistance or metastasis of CCA, and to develop effective treatment regimens using targeted agents."
10878958,"RFA-DC-22-001: Translating a biostimulatory implant for the long-term treatment of glottic
insufficiency
Abstract
Glottic insufficiency (GI) is a laryngeal disorder that can impair communication and swallowing
function due to vocal fold paralysis, presbylarynges, trauma, surgery, or radiation. The most common
treatment for GI is vocal fold augmentation with temporary nanoporous biomaterials that assist with
glottic closure. However, currently available materials poorly restore the biomechanical properties of
the native vocal fold and can be associated with dense histiocytic responses, while only lasting three
to eighteen months. In addition, vocal folds are a complex laminar tissue capable of producing voice
due to specific mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix and cellular components. However,
the structural, cellular, and intrinsic mechanical effects of vocal fold augmentation have not yet been
fully characterized, particularly after achieving homeostasis in situ. There is a need for a well
characterized and purposefully-designed injectable implant that can restore permanent laryngeal
function without producing inflammation or compromising vocal fold pliability. To address this need,
we developed a novel iteration of microporous annealed particle (MAP) scaffold that is
biomechanically matched to the vocal fold, capable of promoting tissue integration, and providing
persistent tissue bulk. This proposal aims to (1) develop assays of MAP-associated de novo
tissue formation, (2) characterize the clinical feasibility of in vivo delivery, (3) determine the
toxicology profile and (4) initiate a first-in-human clinical trial of MAP hydrogel vocal fold
augmentation."
10935947,"ABSTRACT. Hispanics/Latinos (“HL”, genetically admixed of European [EU], African [AF] and Native American
[NA] ancestry) show higher prevalence and incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to non-Hispanic
Whites. Numbers of HL and other admixed groups in the US remain insufficient to provide statistical
significance in identifying risky and protective genetic variants, especially if rare. To this end, we introduce our
study: Global LAtinos Sequencing Study for AD (“GLASS-AD”). We will contribute to generate necessary
numbers for rare variants (RV) discovery in HL phenotyped for AD. Our proposal responds to the
Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) Follow-Up Study 2.0 (PAR 21-212) FOA, which urges to ensure
appropriate representation of diverse populations in genetic studies of AD by leveraging existing cohorts and/or
planning new recruitment to obtain sufficient sample sizes and power. In this study we will generate new whole
genome sequencing data (WGS) in 6,000 HL: N=4,000 as part of our recently funded study “Recruitment and
Retention for Alzheimer's Disease Diversity Genetic Cohorts in the ADSP” (READD-ADSP AG074865) and
N=2,000 newly recruited individuals from Peru and Bolivia, leveraging the established local networks of two
ongoing recruitment studies (R56AG069118; R01AG070864). GLASS-AD, together with other independent HL
cohorts, will ultimately provide us with a large set of individuals with wide range of ancestry proportion, particularly
for NA ancestry (8% in Caribbean Hispanics, ~50% in Mexicans, 70% in Peruvian mestizos, >90% in Peruvian
and Bolivian indigenous groups). Importantly, we will increase representation of samples with substantial
NA ancestry, which are needed because currently underrepresented compared to samples with predominant
African ancestry (e.g., African Americans, Caribbean Hispanics). In addition to new recruitment and WGS data,
we will I) generate AD-biomarkers (Aβ42, tau proteins etc.) in the 2,000 Peruvians/Bolivians and II) conduct a
follow-up visit in a subset of healthy controls and mild cognitive impairment recruited by GLASS-AD in
Peru/Bolivia (N=1,000) and READD-ADSP (N=1,000) at ~3 years from initial visit to assess clinical progress.
We will also elucidate the association between AD and collected risk factors (cognition, health conditions and
behaviors, blood biomarkers) cross-sectionally and longitudinally and perform traditional and innovative RV
analyses. GLASS-AD is fully integrated with major ADSP consortia: samples will be deposited at the National
Cell Repository for Alzheimer's Disease (NCRAD), genetic data will be quality controlled and harmonized
following Genome Center for Alzheimer's Disease (GCAD) guidelines, deposited and shared by NIA Genetics of
Alzheimer’s Disease Data Storage Site (NIAGADS). GLASS data will be shared with the ADSP Follow-Up Study
(“FUS” AG057659, AG062943 and AG076482), which is sequencing several independent HL cohorts and will
ensure the largest collection of HL with WGS data. Importantly, our analyses methods will be harmonized with
ongoing ADSP analyses consortia (e.g. Collaborative for Alzheimer’s Disease Research [CADRE])."
10875397,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Recent studies have revealed that crosstalk between glioma cells and the brain microenvironment is a
crucial regulator of cancer initiation and progression. A vast majority of glioma patients suffer from seizures, and
this pathological neuronal activity has been proposed to contribute to increased glioma growth and proliferation.
While some have hypothesized that neurons may be directly altering glioma cell activity, this proposal
investigates whether a more prominent consequence of pathological neuronal activity is to cause activation of
microglia, whose pro-inflammatory response contributes to glioma growth. This proposal will investigate
glioma-induced changes in neuronal and microglial activity and whether neuronal activity, microglia,
and glioma cells are mechanistically linked in driving cancer progression. Microglia have been separately
implicated in both epileptogenesis and glioma growth. Neurons communicate directly with microglia through
secreted purines, such as ATP, acting on microglial purinergic receptors. This ATP binding causes microglial
activation, and activated microglia have been shown to stimulate glioma cell growth, enhance invasiveness and
migration of glioma cells, and cause angiogenesis. P2RX7 is a well-studied purinergic receptor present on
microglia, shown in preliminary data to be highly expressed in the tumor microenvironment. In aim 1, I will use
whisker stimulation with simultaneous in-vivo imaging of neuronal and microglial calcium activity to determine if
the presence of glioma causes pathological stimulus-evoked responses in neurons and microglia. In aim 2, I will
utilize electroconvulsive seizure (ECS) induction to determine the effect of seizures, a known instance of
pathological neuronal activity, on microglial expression of inflammatory cytokines as well as on glioma growth.
In both aims I will administer Brilliant Blue G (BBG), a selective P2RX7 inhibitor with known CNS penetrance to
interrogate if these effects are mediated through purinergic signaling between neurons and microglia."
10856914,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Gender minority people of color (GM POC) have documented disparities in mental and physical health. These
disparities have been attributed, at least in part, to minority stress. Perceived social support has been shown to
be protective, and may buffer the impact of minority stress on health. However, little is known about the social
relations and connectedness of GM POC. This study therefore examines the social relations of GM POC and
identifies targets for future interventions to enhance their social connectedness, health and wellbeing. Guided
by the Convoy Model of Social Relations, the study aims to: (1) Examine the social relations and connectedness
of GM POC age 18-69 through in-depth, qualitative interviews (N = 60); (2) adapt the established structured
Social Convoy Interview protocol to quantitatively assess the contemporary social networks and support of GM
POC adults through a series of cognitive interviews (N = 24); and (3) identify strengths and weaknesses in social
connectedness that moderate the association between minority stress and outcomes of mental health and aging
among a community sample of GM POC (N = 360). GM POC will be recruited through venue-based sampling in
the New York City and New Orleans metropolitan areas, two cities that differ in structural stigma, both in terms
of policies related to gender diversity and history of systematic racism. The study will combine self-report
interview data and telomere length as a biomarker of aging. The study will result in an in-depth understanding of
the social connectedness of GM POC; an instrument to assess the contemporary social networks of this minority
population; and generalizable knowledge about the mechanism of how social support may buffer the negative
impact of minority stress on health. Findings will inform future interventions to reduce social isolation and
disparities in health among gender and racial/ethnic minority populations."
10909913,"Despite the association between gut microbiota and multiple sclerosis (MS) being increasingly
appreciated, the mechanism through which gut bacteria and their metabolites modulate disease in MS is poorly
understood. We and others have shown a link between perturbations in the gut microbiota in MS patients. Gut
dysbiosis, a qualitative alteration in healthy gut microbiota is characterized by an increased abundance of
inflammation-promoting bacteria (pathobiont) and depletion of beneficial bacteria (symbionts). As MS is an
inflammatory disease, an increase in pathobionts and/or decrease in symbionts might promote pro-
inflammatory environment influencing disease development and progression. Pathobionts are known to
promote pro-inflammatory environment by causing increased intestinal permeability which leads to leaky gut
syndrome by allowing leakage of bacterial products (LPS and other inflammatory mediators) into the systemic
circulation. Increased systemic levels of gut permeability linked inflammatory mediators (GPLIMS) can induce
inflammation through canonical and non-canonical pathways including suppression of specialized pro-resolving
mediators (SPMs), a set of naturally occurring molecules produced within our body to dampen inflammation. It
is important to highlight that gut microbiota help in production of SPMs from diet. Alteration in the ratio of
GPLIMs and SPMs could modulate the disease course and clinical outcomes. Additionally, depletion of
symbionts responsible for maintaining immune homeostasis can also promote a pro-inflammatory environment
by tilting balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory immune responses towards pro-inflammatory response.
We have earlier reported that multiple gut bacteria associated with metabolism of dietary phytoestrogens into
Equol is depleted in MS patients, thus highlighting a critical role of phytoestrogen metabolism in mediating
beneficial effect of gut microbiome. Although, an inverse correlation between leaky gut and Equol had been
reported in some inflammatory diseases, its role in the pathobiology of MS is unknown.
 There is a knowledge gap in our understanding about the mechanism(s) of gut dysbiosis in MS
patients. To this end, our proposal is significant and critical to fill this void by determining the relative
contributions of pathobionts (leaky gut syndrome) and symbionts (phytoestrogen metabolism) in MS. Our long-
term goal is to determine mechanism(s) through which gut bacteria and their metabolites influence protection
from or predisposition/progression to MS. We hypothesize that gut dysbiosis promotes MS through
enrichment of pathobionts which leads to leaky gut syndrome in addition to depletion of beneficial Equol
producing gut bacteria. We, therefore, propose to determine the significance of leaky gut and Equol producing
gut bacteria in the pathogenesis of MS in the following three aims. In the first aim, we will test the hypothesis
that gut dysbiosis in MS patients results in leaky gut and increased pro-inflammatory (GPLIMs) and decreased
anti-inflammatory mediators specifically SPMs. Second aim will enable us to test the hypothesis that treatment
naïve MS patients will have reduced levels of equol and equol producing bacteria compared to HCs. In the last
aim, we will test the hypothesis that MS patients on disease modifying therapies (DMTs) will restore the levels
of SPMs and equol/equol synthesizing bacteria. By the end of this study, we expect to identify the potential
mechanism by which gut dysbiosis influences clinical outcomes in MS patients, especially the significance of
GPLIMs, SPMs, and Equol producing bacteria. We expect to identify potential therapeutic biomolecules such
as SPMs and gut commensal bacteria which can suppress disease in the murine model of MS. This project
has the potential to discover an indigenous set of biomolecules that can be utilized in clinical medicine as
potential biomarkers. Thus, data from our study will enable us to take a bench side discovery to the bedside in
MS patients."
10875483,"The acetylation of proteins and RNA, and acetyl-transfer reactions that produce cellular metabolites, are
evolutionarily conserved modifications that are essential for life. The post- or co-translational acetylation of
proteins provides an essential mechanism for organisms to react to external and internal stimuli; examples
include acetylation of the e-amino group of lysine side chains of histone proteins by histone
acetyltransferases (HATs) or the N-terminal a-amino group by N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs),
respectively; and the acetylation at the N4 position of cytidine bases by Nat10. Acetyl-transfer reactions
produce cellular metabolites that can mediate the biosynthesis of essential cellular building blocks;
examples include: acetyl-CoA produced by ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) and acetyl-CoA synthetase short-
chain family member 2 (ACSS2); fatty acids produced by Fatty Acid Synthase (FASN); and cholesterol and
isoprenoids formed through the sequential reactions of many enzymes. The enzymes that mediate acetyl-
transfer reactions often function in the context of multiple domain proteins or multisubunit protein
complexes, which play essential roles in the regulation of cognate substrate recognition and targeting
and/or catalytic fidelity. How the various protein domains and protein cofactors cooperate for their
respective acetyl-transfer reactions remains poorly understood. Correlating with their biological importance,
the aberrant activities of acetyl-transfer enzymes or their regulatory proteins have been associated with
several maladies including cancers, rare genetic disorders, cardiovascular diseases and metabolic and
neurodegenerative syndromes, thus making these enzymes attractive drug targets for therapy. Taken
together, acetyl-transfer reactions play an important regulatory function in the vast majority of the human
proteome, RNAome and metabolome, and aberrant acetyl-transfer reaction function is correlated with
human disease. Despite the importance of acetyl-transfer reactions, mechanistic information regarding
their distinct modes of regulation are poorly understood and pharmacological agents that target them are
not available. In this proposal, we will address the following broad questions underlying acetyl-transfer
reactions: (A) How do protein and RNA acetyltransferases mediate substrate specificity? (B) How do
auxiliary proteins and ribosome association contribute to NAT function? (C) How does acetyl-CoA
metabolism link to chromatin regulation and fatty acid synthesis? (D) Can we leverage mechanistic and
structural information to develop potent and selective inhibitors for acetyl-transfer reactions? Together,
these studies will reveal how a common acetyltransferase fold is modulated by other proteins or domains to
mediate the acetylation of distinct substrates, how N-terminal protein acetylation is modulated by regulatory
and associated factors, dissect the molecular mechanism of essential acetyl-transfer enzymes, and provide
probes to better understand the biology of acetyl-transfer enzymes with clear implications for therapy."
10877018,"Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a severely disabling and highly heritable condition that afflicts ~1% of the global
population. Despite the advances in genetics that have shed light on the biology of so many diseases and led to
groundbreaking new treatments for conditions from blindness to cancer, genetic studies in SCZ have been
hindered by its genetic complexity and phenotypic heterogeneity: two patients who do not share a single
symptom can both receive the same diagnosis. One way forward is to define molecular subtypes, an approach
that has been successful in oncology and other realms of medicine, but which often requires identifying distinct
phenotypic subtypes. We therefore propose to study the most severe form of the disorder—extremely
treatment-resistant SCZ (ETRS)—because rare genetic variants of large effects are likely to be enriched in this
population. ETRS patients are the top 1% most severely affected patients, often remain hospitalized for
decades, and are not usually included in genetic studies, in part because they are not accessible to most
researchers. We will recruit 400 subjects with ETRS from the New York State inpatient system, thoroughly
characterize their phenotype, and perform whole genome sequencing (WGS). Our preliminary data from 75
ETRS patients revealed a higher-than-expected prevalence of seizures, dysmorphic features, and cognitive
impairment, which suggest the presence of one of the 60 Mendelian diseases known to mimic SCZ.
Furthermore, prior research and our preliminary data indicate that SCZ severity, cognitive impairment, and
treatment resistance are associated with a greater burden of rare single nucleotide variants (SNVs), copy
number variants (CNVs), and common variant polygenic risk. Therefore, in Aim 1, we will use diagnostic WGS
to identify (a) Mendelian conditions that mimic SCZ, such as Niemann-Pick disease type C, and (b)
pharmacogenetic variants that reduce the efficacy of antipsychotic treatments. Patients with either type of
mutation may be treatable. In Aim 2, we will (a) evaluate the burden of rare SNVs and rare CNVs. Since
extreme phenotypes can also be due to an excess of common variant risk, we will (b) determine the common
variant burden by calculating SCZ polygenic risk scores. We will use 6,500 individuals with typical SCZ and
165,000 healthy individuals as controls for Aims 1 and 2. The project will be conducted at Columbia University
Medical Center by Anthony Zoghbi, MD, a psychiatrist with clinical expertise and a career goal of becoming an
independent investigator in psychiatric genetics, focusing on SCZ. Dr. Zoghbi's comprehensive five-year
training plan will enable him to develop expertise in statistical genetics and genomics, cognitive assessment of
SCZ, and clinical research methods under the mentorship of David Goldstein, PhD (Director, Institute for
Genomic Medicine), statistical geneticist Suzanne Leal, PhD, and neuropsychologist Terry Goldberg, PhD. The
proposed aims align with his training goals and will elucidate the genetic architecture of ETRS, shed light on
the pathophysiology of SCZ, and improve the care of those most disabled by SCZ."
10875402,"Renewal Request for R01-NS064934 “Mechanisms of LRRK2 Neurotoxicity” Parkinson's disease (PD) and related Lewy body diseases represent common causes of Alzheimer's disease related dementias (ADRDs). According to the National Alzheimer's Project Act, Lewy body diseases
affect more than one-million Americans, with onset of disease typically earlier in life than dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease. Tens of thousands of Americans harbor LRRK2 missense variants that can cause PD. Longitudinal studies show LRRK2 mutation carriers largely follow a typical course of motor and cognitive impairment over time, mirroring idiopathic disease. Post-mortem studies show that LRRK2 mutations are a potent genetic risk factor for the aggregation of tau and α-synuclein. LRRK2 variants associate with susceptibility to Crohn's disease and mycobacteria infection, highlighting LRRK2 function in immune cells.  In the past project period, we observed a dual-activation phenomenon with intrinsic LRRK2 modifying α-synuclein aggregation in neurons, as well as high LRRK2 expression in myeloid cells recruited to the brain in disease models. In a novel enzymatic cycle that we intend to closely examine, LRRK2 mutations may increase
cis LRRK2 kinase activity in autophosphorylation as well as trans phosphorylation of a small subset of Rab proteins. In our continued efforts to understand LRRK2 function in disease, we focus our attention to LRRK2- Rab substrate interactions. We propose a series of quantitative proximity labeling approaches to probe the
inner catalytic core of LRRK2-Rab enzymatic cycling in disease-relevant cells. These experiments will be
anchored through structure-function relationships identified by cryo-electron microscopy analysis of relevant
protein complexes. We predict these experiments will shed light on how disparate pathogenic mutations in
LRRK2 share a common final output in Rab hyper-phosphorylation. Further, we will explore how LRRK2
variants linked to protection from disease might affect the LRRK2-Rab catalytic cycle. Both LRRK2 and its Rab
substrate constituency demonstrate some of the highest expression in subsets of myeloid cells in the immune
system. In complement to our biochemical approach, we will dissect the role of LRRK2 in pro-inflammatory
macrophages recruited to the brain in an AAV-α-synuclein mouse model. We anticipate mutant LRRK2
expression in peripheral immune cells will exacerbate deleterious neuroinflammation that correlates to
dopaminergic neurodegeneration. We further predict that LRRK2 knockout in peripheral immune cells will
attenuate pro-inflammatory responses in the brain and α-synuclein-induced loss of dopamine neurons. As
several exploratory therapies that target LRRK2 have recently advanced through safety trials in the clinic, with
project success, we predict our studies will further emphasize LRRK2-Rab signaling and peripheral immune
responses in LRRK2-linked disease."

Children with acquired brain injuries (ABI) treated on an inpatient rehabilitation unit are at significant risk for
long term functional impairment, highlighting the importance of maximizing the effectiveness and utilization of
inpatient rehabilitation therapies. The proposed crossover trial seeks to determine the effect of animal-assisted
therapy (AAT) during inpatient rehabilitation following pediatric acquired brain injury. To accomplish this
objective, we will employ a within subjects cross-over trial. Data will be collected during four therapy sessions
across two weeks (2 in week 1 of admission and 2 in week 2 of admission). AAT, via integration of dogs into
patient's physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT) session, will occur during one of the two
sessions in the first week and one of the two sessions the second week. The non-AAT condition will be
treatment as usual (TAU) as defined by the patient's treatment team, resulting in 2 AAT sessions and 2 TAU
sessions total. The order of condition will be randomized separately for each week. We will recruit 90 patients
ages 4-21 being treated for ABI on the inpatient rehabilitation unit at CCHMC. We have engaged a highly
qualified multidisciplinary team to ensure the safety, feasibility, and effectiveness of the methods. We will
accomplish the following aims: 1) determine the effect of AAT on patient engagement in inpatient rehabilitation
therapies, 2) examine potential mechanisms of action for AAT-associated improvement in patient engagement
(mood and physiological distress), and 3) determine factors that moderate the effect of AAT on patient
engagement (patient anthropomorphism, patient-animal closeness, time course in admission, and
demographic and injury characteristics). We hypothesize that a greater level of patient engagement will be
observed during AAT sessions compared to treatment as usual (TAU) sessions. Additionally, AAT will be
associated with more positive mood and lower levels of distress, which in turn will be related to greater patient
engagement. Finally, a greater effect of AAT will be noted earlier during patient admissions, and greater levels
of anthropomorphism and patient-animal closeness will be associated with greater levels of patient
engagement during AAT sessions. We propose the use of novel methodology and innovative technology in
data collection designed to address concerns related to bias and reliance of subjective outcomes in the AAT
evidence base. This innovation positions the project to fill an important gap in the existing AAT literature.
Findings will provide critical new insights into why pediatric inpatients benefit from AAT and who is most likely
to benefit. We will translate our findings to ultimately improve functional outcomes following pediatric brain
injury, a leading cause of disability."

Endogenous glucose production (EGP) is a crucial process that maintains blood
glucose levels under fasting conditions and is normally inhibited by both glucose and
insulin. Inappropriately high EGP is the major source of hyperglycemia in individuals
with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and contributes significantly to diabetes complications. Our
groups’ ongoing work suggests that central nervous system (CNS) signals play an
important role in regulating EGP. ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels in the
ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) appear to mediate some of the suppressive effects
of circulating insulin and glucose on EGP, but this regulation is impaired in T2D and
diabetic rodents. We have observed that lowering free fatty acid (FFA) levels completely
restored the regulation of EGP by central KATP channel activation. Therefore, we
hypothesize that chronic lipid overload may contribute to the central signaling defects in
T2D. Thus, through complementary human and rodent studies we propose to expand
our understanding of how specific CNS signaling pathways regulate EGP through the
following specific aims: 1) To establish whether central regulation of EGP can be
restored by lowering FFA levels in patients with T2D, 2) To determine whether intact
hepatic innervation is required for restoration of central regulation of EGP upon lowering
FFA in individuals with T2D, and 3) To establish whether the impaired central regulation
of EGP in T2D is mediated by neuron-specific defects in KATP channel activation within
the VMH. Furthermore, we will determine whether lowering FFA levels contributes to
restoring central regulation of glucose production by reducing endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) stress in specific glucose-sensing neurons. Collectively, these studies should
provide mechanistic explanation(s) for the impaired central regulation of EGP in T2D
and help point toward novel therapeutic targets."

 Perceptually guided behavior involves a complex and dynamic interplay between external inputs and
internal states that are related, for example, to alertness, motivation, expectations and attention. A wide range
of evidence suggests that the representation, processing, and flow of sensory information in the primate brain
is regulated by several neuromodulatory systems. However, our understanding of the physiological and
behavioral impact of neuromodulatory signals during complex behaviors in primates is quite rudimentary and
is lagging behind what is known in rodents. The main reason for this lag is the lack of advanced molecular,
genetic and physiological tools for targeting neuromodulatory circuits and for studying their role in behaving
non-human primates, which are the best animal model for human perception, cognition and motor control.
The overarching goal of the current proposal is to develop and test an optical-genetic toolbox for monitoring
and controlling multiple interacting brain regions in awake, behaving non-human primates. We focus on
neuromodulatory circuits that exert a powerful, yet poorly understood, impact on the cortical circuits that
mediate perceptual decision-making.
 To achieve this goal, we will use advanced anatomical and transcriptomic tools to identify the main
neuromodulatory molecules and circuits that are likely to play an important role in controlling information
processing and flow in several key cortical regions along the sensory-decision-motor arc. We will then develop
viral-based genetic tools that will allow one to selectively express reporters and actuators in these key
neuromodulatory circuits in primates. Finally, we will develop and optimize optical and electrophysiological
tools that will allow one to monitor and control neuromodulatory circuits while simultaneously measuring
neural population responses in key cortical regions as monkeys perform complex perceptual tasks with
precisely-controlled behavioral demands. To validate these methods, we will study the role of neuromodulators
during perceptual decision-making in primates. This optical-genetic toolbox will be widely applicable for
studying the role of neuromodulatory circuits in mediating adaptive behaviors in primates. More generally, the
tools that will be developed for monitoring and manipulating multiple interacting brain regions during
behavior will advance our ability to study neural information processing during complex behaviors in primates."

10834177,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Natural products from the soil-dwelling bacteria Streptomyces have been a rich source of medicines, including
antimicrobials and anticancer agents. Unfortunately, discovery of novel bioactive natural products from
Streptomyces using traditional techniques is often unsuccessful due to the re-discovery of known molecules.
Genome sequencing suggests that Streptomyces are capable of making many more (likely hundreds-of
thousands more) molecules than those typically observed in the laboratory. However, the biosynthetic
machinery responsible for producing these novel natural products is often cryptic (i.e. transcriptionally inactive).
Co-culture of Streptomyces with other microorganisms induces production of natural products not observed in
monocultures. However, the signals that control this induction are poorly understood. A significant gap remains
in the strategies available to discover new bioactive natural products from cryptic biosynthetic gene clusters. Our
long-term goal is to develop strategies to overcome this gap, thus maximizing the natural product potential from
Streptomyces. Over the next five years, we aim to identify small molecules capable of inducing natural product
production (i.e. chemical elicitors, Project 1) as well as utilizing state-of-the-art bioinformatics to predict and
directly chemically synthesize natural products (Project 2). Low levels of certain antibiotics have been found to
induce production of a few natural products. The generality of this effect remains unknown, as does the
mechanism by which these compounds induce production of natural products. The objectives for the first project
are to 1) Study the ability of mechanistically distinct antibiotics to act as chemical elicitors in a variety of distantly
related Streptomyces strains and 2) Determine the mechanisms of the chemical elicitors. This work will provide
a greater understanding of antibiotic regulation of natural product production, which will allow both our laboratory
and others to activate production of natural products in a more targeted manner and ultimately increase the
number of bioactive natural products that we as a community can discover. In the second project, we are directly
chemically synthesizing cyclic peptide natural products that are bioinformatically predicted from non-ribosomal
peptide synthetase biosynthetic gene clusters. Cyclic peptides are an important family of natural products,
including many FDA-approved drugs. Their large size and rigidity allows them to target challenging-to-hit targets
(e.g. protein-protein interactions). The objectives for the second project are to 1) Develop a bioinformatics
method to identify cryptic non-ribosomal peptide synthetase genes that encode production of diverse cyclic
peptides, 2) Chemically synthesize a library of several hundred of the predicted cyclic peptides, 3) Use the library
to study the rules that regulate peptide cell-membrane permeability and 4) Screen the library for antibiotic and
anticancer activity. This work will provide access to hundreds of previously inaccessible natural products that will
be useful tools for the study of cyclic peptide membrane permeability and will likely have interesting bioactivities."
10834179,"Summary of Work
The somatic assembly of antigen receptor (AgR) genes by V(D)J recombination creates the diverse antigen
receptor repertoires of T and B lymphocytes and is fundamental to adaptive immunity in jawed vertebrates.
AgR genes are contained within large and complex genetic loci that must be regulated at multiple levels to
achieve essential outcomes of early lymphocyte development. Recombination must be developmentally
ordered to allow the production and selection of lymphocyte subsets with appropriate characteristics and in
appropriate numbers. Recombination may be subject to allelic regulation to ensure that each lymphocyte
expresses a single receptor with unique antigen specificity. Recombination must be subject to safeguards that
ensure genomic integrity. Recombination must also be sufficiently stochastic to generate AgR repertoires
characterized by extensive combinatorial diversity. RAG recombinase activity is targeted to AgR loci by
multiple chromatin-based mechanisms, including local modifications to AgR chromatin structure, large-scale
conformational features and long-distance DNA contacts, and subnuclear compartmentalization of AgR loci.
Our studies aim to reveal fundamental molecular mechanisms underpinning the developmental regulation of
V(D)J recombination at T cell receptor (TCR) loci in developing thymocytes in vivo. Among the various AgR
loci, the Tcra-Tcrd locus is unrivaled in its complexity, because it contains two sets of gene segments that
undergo recombination at different stages of T cell development and contribute to the formation of TCR chains
expressed by distinct subsets of T cells. Notably, a single allele can undergo multiple cycles of rearrangement,
with initial Tcrd rearrangement followed by a succession of primary and secondary Tcra rearrangements, with
each deletional rearrangement replacing the one prior. We have developed substantial insights into how this
recombination program is enforced at the level of chromatin, and now seek to understand two major aspects of
this program. First, what role does Tcrd recombination play in the development of a combinatorially diverse
Tcra repertoire? Second, what is the role of the DNA damage response in pacing the succession of Tcra
rearrangements? Temporal regulation is essential to allow thymocyte selection based on expression of TCR
proteins before the rearranged Tcra gene is deleted by a subsequent Tcra recombination event. Among the
TCR loci, only Tcrb is subject to allelic exclusion. This locus is also highly unusual in that it associates with the
nuclear lamina (NL), a compartment generally considered repressive for transcription and V(D)J
recombination. Yet the locus associates with the NL during the developmental stage when the locus is initially
transcribed and undergoes rearrangement. Our recent work provides both a map and mechanistic insight into
Tcrb-NL interactions. We now plan to leverage this knowledge to determine how association with the NL
regulates Tcrb rearrangement and Tcrb allelic exclusion in developing thymocytes in vivo. We will address
these questions by generation and analysis of novel strains of genetically manipulated mice."

The pathogenic nature of MeCP2 in the neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome (RTT) has been known for
almost 20 years; however, there currently no viable intervention strategies. One contributing factor to the paucity

fact that RTT almost exclusively affects females, who are mosaic for the x-linked MECP2 allele (Mecp2+/-).
Furthermore, RTT patients rarely have mutations that result in loss of MeCP2 protein, rather have missense or
truncating mutations that render key functional domains hypomorphic. To address this failing in construct validity,
we performed RNA-sequencing on cerebellar and motor cortex samples from 9 RTT patient autopsies to
identifying potentially druggable targets which might begin from a place of translational relevance. This approach
led us to focus on muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs), where 4 of the 5 subtypes had significantly
disrupted expression. Of particular interest was the mAChR1 (CHRM1, M1) subtype, which has long been
considered a viable therapeutic target for neuropsychiatric diseases. Excitingly, we recently used 44 temporal
cortex samples from RTT autopsies to confirm that decreased CHRM1 expression is a robust and highly
penetrant aspect of RTT pathophysiology in humans. We then established that administration of an M1 positive
allosteric modulator (PAM), VU0453595 (VU595), significantly improves social and respiratory (apnea)
phenotypes in Mecp2+/- mice. In Aim 1, we propose to expand these preliminary data by testing the effects of M1
potentiation against a full battery of RTT-like phenotypes in mice, using structurally distinct M1 PAMs, acute and
chronic dosing paradigms, and multiple modes of pharmacology. Interestingly, if RTT autopsy expression data
is binned by MECP2 mutation, then signature expression patterns are observed, not only for M1 but for virtually
all preclinical target genes tested. As changes in gene expression are often the rationale for target selection, and
modulation of neurotransmission in contexts where receptor function is normal carries an increased risk for
adverse effects, these findings have important implications regarding the need for precision medicine in RTT. In
Aim 2, we will use mice carrying common RTT mutations (T158M, R168X, R255X, and R306C) to determine
whether expression patterns can be used to predict M1 PAM efficacy. We will couple these experiment with
transcript and proteomic analysis of RTT autopsy samples to quantify global gene expression patterns in the
medulla of RTT patient sub-populations. Finally, of our existing data set, we consider the effect of VU595 on
apneas to be a salient finding, both because respiratory dysfunction is predictive of early lethality in RTT and
because apneas represent a highly translatable outcome measure. In Aim 3, we propose to mechanistically
dissect the role of M1 in RTT respiratory phenotypes by coupling whole body plethysmography and in vivo cyclic
voltammetry experiments in Mecp2 knock-in mice to determine the M1 PAM mechanism of action, as well as
define where and how M1 functions in the respiratory circuit across RTT sub-populations."

It is estimated that up to 28% of the global burden of disease may be amenable to surgical
treatment. The majority of affected individuals live in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC).
Globally, an additional 143 million surgical procedures are needed annually to meet the unmet
need of surgery, and a failure to expand surgical access to populations in need would result in a
total loss in gross-domestic product of 12.3 trillion dollars globally. Africa has one of the highest
burdens of untreated surgical problems. Moreover, a large proportion of those without access to
adequate surgical care are forcibly displaced persons and refugees who number 82 million and
25 million, respectively. Refugees face double the burden of surgical problems than non-refugee
populations in LMICs. The absence of comprehensive training programs in the implementation
science of surgery, rehabilitation, and humanitarian health creates a serious impediment to
research, evidence-based policy changes, and impactful changes. The proposed 2023-2028
Johns Hopkins University, Tanzania Red Cross Society and Muhimbili University School
of Public Health and Social Sciences Education and Mentoring Program On Surgical
Work and Rehabilitation in Tanzania (EMPOWER-TZ) will build on the expertise in surgery
and rehabilitation, humanitarian health, and health systems of Johns Hopkins, Muhimbili
University of Health and Allied Sciences, and the Tanzania Red Cross Society. EMPOWER-TZ
will strengthen research capacity to address the burden of surgical disease, short and long term
outcomes of surgery, and rehabilitation needs in humanitarian settings within Tanzania.
Specifically, we seek to better develop capacity to study post-surgery outcomes across lived
experiences and develop capacity and interdisciplinary teams to better study surgery and
rehabilitation sciences in humanitarian contexts. Our model will focus on using expertise at JHU
to strengthen the capacity within MUHAS, while simultaneously leveraging the vast experience
of TRCS in humanitarian health to provide both contextual expertise and hands-on training
opportunities in this program. Importantly, the focus areas and execution of this grant will be
done in full partnership. The goal is to promote an ethical, sustainable, and impactful
collaboration between the three institutions focused on building research capacity to study the
implementation science of surgery, rehabilitation, and humanitarian health."
10892805,"Social and behavioral determinants of MOUD utilization and opioid overdose
In the US, over 192 people die each day due to opioid overdose (OOD), the leading cause of accidental death
among adults. Veterans are especially vulnerable to OOD, experiencing rates double those of non-Veterans,
due to their higher prevalence of opioid use disorder (OUD). Medication treatment for OUD (MOUD) is the gold
standard treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD). However, in the Veterans Health Administration of the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and non-VA hospitals, access to MOUD care is lacking. Compounding
poor access, many patients who receive buprenorphine discontinue within 1 year, an indicator of suboptimal
treatment retention.
Social determinants of health are the conditions in which people are born, live, work, and age. Adverse social
determinants of health include job insecurity, housing insecurity, financial insecurity, food insecurity, as well as
legal, social/familial, transportation, and violence problems. Together with adverse behavioral health factors
such as substance use and mental health disorders (e.g., major depression), adverse social and behavioral
determinants of health (SBDH) are associated with poorer health, and concurrent adverse SBDH can have
compounding negative health consequences. The overarching goal of this proposal is to understand SBDH,
biological variables, clinical settings and clinical factors that impact MOUD access and outcomes and to
develop predictive models for MOUD outcomes."
10827983,"ABSTRACT Sphingolipid metabolites and their metabolic enzymes, often dysregulated in cancer, may present
a novel but exploitable target for therapeutics against aggressive diseases such as triple -negative breast cancer
(TNBC) and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2+) breast cancers, where new therapy is desperately
needed. A growing body of evidence implicates the cellular bioactive sphingolipid metabolite, ceramide -1-
phosphate (C1P), and ceramide kinase (CERK), the only mammalian enzyme known to produce cellul ar C1P,
as essential signaling mediators of inflammation and cancer progression. However, the function of C1P and
CERK remains enigmatic. Nevertheless, CERK is prominently associated with cancer, including lung
adenocarcinoma, pancreatic cancer, and breast cancer. Excessive tumor CERK expression correlates with
greater aggressiveness and poorer clinical outcome. A Cancer CERK is linked with activation of Ras/ERK,
PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and resistance to chemotherapy. It is commonly thought that Golgi-resident CERK generates
C1P that is released into the extracellular milieu and that signals through unknowncell surface G -protein coupled
receptors to regulate inflammation and cancer cell survival, migration and wound healing. Challenging the notion
of Golgi-resident CERK, our Preliminary Results showed enzymatically active CERK is enriched in the nucleus
of normal breast epithelial cells and highly overexpressed in aggressive breast cancer cells. The presence of
nuclear CERK and intracellular C1P implicate an undocumented underlying mechanism in aggressive breast
cancer. Moreover, our Preliminary Data point to a previously uncharacterized role of CERK in aggressive
diseases. 1.) Analysis of breast cancer metastases cohort (GSE2034, n=286) data revealed higher expression
levels of CERK mRNA are linked to poor relapse-free survival (RFS). 2.) Our RNA-Seq data showed that CERK
expression is elevated in primary breast tumors in patients with a history of breast cancer bone metastasis. 3.)
As a proof-of-principle, an existing CERK inhibitor, NVP-231, drastically reduced the 3D invasive growth of
aggressive breast cancer cells. 4.) NVP-231 also reduces aggressive type tumor progression and metastasis in
mouse models. The overarching hypothesis is that CERK and C1P in the nucleus play a key role in aggressive
breast cancer progression and metastasis. The immediate goal of this proposal is to gather more robust
preliminary data to understand the functions, a) clinical utility and significance, and b) characterization of CERK
and C1P in aggressive breast cancers. Two Specific Aims are proposed, 1) Clinical significance of ceramide
kinase and C1P and 2) Functional role of ceramide kinase and C1P in aggressive breast cancers. The scope of
the proposed work explores a previously unknown novel mechanism by which CERK and C1P function in the
nucleus. This work will demonstrate whether nuclear C1P and CERK are critical for aggressive diseases for
developing novel therapeutics, which can be tested for R01/DoD grant application."

 The mechano-electrical transduction (MET) process allows the transduction of mechanical information
from sound into electrical signals, and it is a fundamental step in cochlear system function. Failures in this
process lead to hearing loss and deafness. Understanding the basic properties of MET will lead to a better
understanding of deafness, leading to targeted treatments and therapies. MET takes place at the level of the
hair bundle and is mediated by tip links, extracellular proteins connecting shorter stereocilia to adjacent taller
stereocilia. Deflections of the hair bundle towards the tallest stereocilia row increase tip-link tension and open
MET channels that reside at the top of the shorter stereocilia. Although there is a large body of work regarding
lipid membrane modulation of mechanosensitive ion channels, there is a limited but growing body of data on
lipid modulation of cochlear hair cell MET.
 The lipid environment can affect channels indirectly through changes in membrane mechanics, or directly
through individual lipid/protein interactions. PIP2, an endogenous phospholipid, modulates MET channel
properties, potentially through a direct interaction or indirectly by altering membrane mechanics. A stretch
activated channel modifier, GsMTx4 reduces the resting open probability (Po) of MET channel while also blocking
the increase in Po induced by lowering external calcium or depolarizing the hair cell, suggesting the lipid
membrane may be involved in modulating MET channel Po. The effect of voltage and calcium could be mediated
through changes in lipid packing due to multivalent ions interacting between adjacent lipids. Our recent direct
assessment of membrane diffusivity of individual stereocilium at a time using two-photon Fluorescent Recovery
after Photobleaching (FRAP) demonstrated that stereocilia membrane is sensitive to calcium and voltage but
not the soma, and MET channel Po co-varies with membrane diffusivity, supporting the hypothesis that the MET
channel can be modulated by membrane mechanics. However, due to spatial and temporal limitations of FRAP,
we were unable to monitor stereocilia membrane locally and dynamically.
 To further test this hypothesis and overcome current technological limitations, I will combine
electrophysiology with live-cell fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) of a novel viscosity sensor to examine the
membrane viscosity with improved spatio-temporal resolution for the first time in mammalian cochlea. I will
assess local and temporal changes in the stereociliary membrane viscosity with voltage, calcium, and membrane
components like cholesterol and PIP2 and correlate these effects to changes in MET channel Po. These studies
will enhance our basic understanding of the importance of lipid membrane in hair cell mechanotransduction.
Understanding the crucial components in the mechanical underpinnings of the stereocilia are both biophysically
and biologically relevant. The development and use of these new technologies will greatly advance my career
as an independent investigator and likely have broader applications in the auditory field and beyond."

The multiple, massive, and rich Big Data streams in healthcare (e.g., electronic health records, mobile
technologies, wearable devices, genomic data) and the emergence of advanced information and computational
technologies (e.g., machine learning and artificial intelligence) offer an invaluable opportunity for applying
innovative Big Data science research in NIAID focus areas of infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and
COVID-19. Big Data science has the potential to identify high-risk individuals and communities and prioritize
them for early biomedical or public health interventions, predict long-term clinical outcomes and disease
progression, and evaluate public health policy impact. Key to addressing these complexities is a critical mass
of health researchers with adequate knowledge, competencies, and skills to unlock important answers from Big
Data to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent these diseases and related comorbidities. However,
there is a nationwide shortage of talent with such knowledge, competencies, and skills, especially in traditional
academic settings. While junior faculty, as part of the generations of digital learners, have the greatest potential
to develop their Big Data health science research agenda, many face multiple structural barriers to conduct Big
Data science research. Such barriers include a lack of protected time to initiate new interdisciplinary Big Data
research, lack of opportunity to participate in funded Big Data research, and a lack of adequate mentoring. To
address these gaps, we propose developing a “Big Data Heath Science Fellow” program for early career junior
faculty (i.e., assistant professors) at health science schools (e.g., medicine, public health, nursing, pharmacy,
social work) at the University of South Carolina (USC). Specifically, we plan to recruit 4 USC health science
junior faculty per year and provide them with protected time (25%) to participate in the comprehensive training
program, including: 1) courses for competency and skill development in Big Data research and professional
development; 2) participation in hands-on research and grant proposal development; and 3) rich mentoring
experience in Big Data research and professional development. The proposed training program will be
implemented with the support of the existing infrastructure of the USC Big Data Health Science Center
(BDHSC), one of USC’s Excellence Initiatives. BDHSC’s mission is to promote and support Big Data health
science research at USC and across SC through capacity development, academic training, professional
development, community engagement, and methodological advancement. BDHSC contains 5 content cores
(electronic health records, geospatial, genomic, social media, and bio-nanomaterial data) and 2 supporting
hubs (business/entrepreneurship and technology) with the involvement of 43 faculty from 10 USC
college/schools. The proposed training will be an integral component of the BDHSC professional development
mission. Upon the accomplishment of the proposed training, each trainee will be expected to: 1) obtain hands-
on mentored research experience on an NIAID-funded project; 2) develop at least one Big Data-related
manuscript on HIV or COVID-19; and 3) submit one grant application to NIAID or other appropriate funding
source. The training program will foster a research environment to encourage individuals from diverse
backgrounds, including those from underrepresented groups, to pursue further Big Data health science
research in HIV, COVID-19, and other NIAID focus areas."

Mika Matsuzaki, PhD, MPH, MS, is an Assistant Professor of Human Nutrition in the Department of International
Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (BSPH). She seeks a K01 Award to gain skillset,
knowledge, and mentored research experiences through exposure to diverse aspects of food systems and sys-
tems science research. This award is a critical step for her to complete the career transition into an independent
scholar contributing new insights on systemic interventions to prevent and reduce youth obesity among disad-
vantaged populations. The proposed training and study build upon her strong training in nutritional epidemiology,
school nutrition policies, and food environments using advanced statistical techniques. The training will build her
expertise in the use of mixed-methods, systems science approaches including simulation models examining
school-centric food systems and youth obesity. Obesity is increasingly recognized as a systems problem, requir-
ing multi-level, multi-component solutions. Previous research, including my own, has shown that at the popula-
tion level, youth obesity disproportionately affects racial/ethnic minority populations as well as those with socio-
economic disadvantages. Given the persisting disparities in youth obesity, novel solutions need to be developed.
To this end, the proposed study will seek ideas for such solutions through examination of factors within food
systems that may have contributed to unexpectedly low obesity prevalence seen in a handful of schools (Aim 1),
which we call positive deviators. We will then estimate the potential impact of introducing new changes in food
systems to improve diet for students in other school settings in simulation models (Aim 2). Dr. Matsuzaki has
access to an excellent research environment and renowned scholars at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) as well
as at her collaboration institutions, San Francisco State University (SFSU) and the City University of New York
(CUNY). She has built a strong mentoring team covering all training and research components with Dr. Joel
Gittelsohn, PhD, MPH (BSPH, primary mentor); co-mentors Dr. Emma Sanchez-Vaznaugh, ScD, MPH (SFSU),
Dr. Jess Fanzo, PhD (JHU), Dr. Bruce Y. Lee, MD, MBA (CUNY), and Dr. Takeru Igusa, PhD (JHU). Dr. Matsu-
zaki will gain hands-on experiences through her proposed research in systems science and youth obesity while
obtaining necessary content expertise and experiences through regular meetings and study activities with her
mentors, courses, workshops, seminars, scientific meetings. The K01 mentored research training and experi-
ence will enable Dr. Matsuzaki to achieve independent scholarship with expertise in systems science approaches
to youth obesity disparities and an ability to design and conduct large-scale simulation studies and develop and
test new systemic interventions in subsequent R01 studies."
10874314,"Abstract (Overall)
Living alone has emerged as a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) that will
affect 14 million Americans, particularly African and Hispanic Americans. A third of community-dwelling older
adults with ADRD live alone, but there are limited interventions to help them live alone safely and for as long as
they desire. Growing research have shown that behavior and lifestyle Interventions can improve cognition,
physical function, and quality of life (QoL) in older adults with cognitive decline (defined as subjective cognitive
decline [SCD], mild cognitive impairment [MCI], or ADRD). However, the real-life uptake of these interventions
has been low because the interventions did not target Mechanisms of Behavior Change (MoBC) and older
adults living alone with cognitive decline and minorities were often excluded by clinical trials. These issues can
be addressed with technology. Hence, the goal of the Arizona State University Roybal Center for Older Adults
Living Alone with Cognitive Decline (ASU Roybal) is to develop infrastructure and conduct clinical trials of
MoBC-driven, technology-enabled interventions to delay ADRD and improve quality of life (QoL) in older adults
living alone with cognitive decline. It is guided by a conceptual framework integrating the NIH’s Stage Model,
MoBC, Symptom Science Model, and NIA’s Health Disparities Research Framework. It hypothesizes that
technology-enabled interventions driven by MoBC (e.g., stress) or biological targets (e.g., inflammation) can
improve proximal (e.g., cognition, emotional wellbeing) and long-term outcomes (e.g., ADRD prevention) in
older adults living alone with cognitive decline. For example, Trial 1 (Stage IB) will focus on MoBC targets of
social support and stress to increase physical activity in older adults living alone with SCD and Trial 2 (Stage I)
on MoBC targets of interpersonal/social processes to improve emotional wellbeing in those with early AD. ASU
Roybal will be co-led by experienced senior scientists who are experts in ADRD, MoBC, behavioral trials,
technology, and administration. The Administrative Core will develop infrastructure, administer Call for Trials,
and evaluate and sustain ASU Roybal’s long-term impact. The Behavioral Intervention Development (BID)
Core will support the design, conduct, and advancement of 12 trials. The Specific Aims are to 1) build the
infrastructure to conduct clinical trials of MoBC-driven, technology-enabled interventions for behavior and
lifestyle change and across the NIH’s Stage Model in older adults living alone with cognitive decline; 2)
facilitate the design and conduct of 12 trials to test interventions’ effects on mechanistic, proximal, and long-
term outcomes in older adults living alone with cognitive decline; and 3) sustain the long-term impact of MoBC-
driven, technology-enabled intervention research on older adults living alone with cognitive decline. ASU
Roybal matches the FOA Thematic Area in targeting MoBC to promote behavior and lifestyle change and is in
line with the National Research Summit recommendations. It will test innovative technology-enabled
interventions in a growing but overlooked population—older adults living alone with cognitive decline."

Changes in memory are one of the most common concerns of older adults. The proposed research examines
how goals can motivate and improve memory in older adults through a strategic focus on selectively
remembering important information. We first test how older adults can learn to focus on what is important
when experiencing stress or arousal from rushing. Relative to younger adults, older adults may feel greater
stress and anxiety due to rushing, when rapidly presented with large amounts of information, but can still
engage in selective encoding of important information with practice under some conditions. Indeed, older
adults can be motivated by responsible remembering and a fear of forgetting (such as when needing to
remember a child's allergies). We will determine if older adults can engage in the control of selective
forgetting and updating information using a directed forgetting task, where one has to selectively remember
items that they are responsible for bringing on a trip. By being able to forget outdated information older adults
can use memory in an efficient manner, and remember when information has changed in value, especially in
terms of positive and negative values. We will also examine how older adults may focus on selectively
remembering changes in financial gains, possibly at the expense of remembering losses, such as changes in
stock prices or updated to a retirement plan. There are practical applications of selective memory in older age,
as one consequence of selectively focusing attention and memory is a potential bias toward gains and
rewards. For example, older adults may be particularly susceptible to financial fraud and related scams
because they selectively focus on positive outcomes and frequently experience loneliness. Thus, older adults
may focus on the enticing opportunity presented in a scam, and the potential rewards, but fail to attend to or
later remember risks or suspicious aspects of the proposition. We will examine how selectivity can lead to
bias in older adults and how selective memory can be effectively redirected toward critical aspects of a
potential scam with repeated testing, thus reducing susceptibility to financial victimization. A memory-testing
program to identify scams will be developed to determine if training can transfer and assist older adults in
effectively identifying other forms of scams, by enhancing selective memory away from potential positive
outcomes and towards signs of deceptive offers, such as advance-fee fraud. Overall, the proposed work can
help older adults selectively remember important information, learn how to selectively forget outdated
information regarding gains and losses and help older adults identify features of scams, providing several
novel and innovative avenues of research that integrate theoretical and translational aspects of memory and
aging."

was named coronavirus disease 2019 (abbreviated “COVID-19”) by the World Health Organization. COVID-19

betacoronavirus that is thought to have originated in bats. Originally its spread was animal-to-human, but
human-to-human transmission is now widespread. No vaccines and treatments for COVID-19 are available,

infection in in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo. We propose to synthesize and evaluate novel lipidated peptides that
have enhanced efficacy. These inhibitors will be evaluated for antiviral activity against live SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Promising candidates will be tested in transmission experiments in a ferret model. This application will
determine whether our approach to entry inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 prevents infection in vivo.

 One of the underexplored aspects of neuronal biology is that as postmitotic neurons become mature, they
undergo dynamic changes to ensure that the mature nervous system is capable of long-term survival and
function. Understanding these mechanisms that are critical for the long-term homeostasis of the adult brain is
important as their dysfunction could increase the vulnerability of neurons to age-related neurodegeneration,
such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
 We have identified miR-29 as a microRNA that is strikingly induced during brain maturation. In contrast
to the high miR-29 levels that are maintained in the normal adult brains, miR-29 levels are reduced in
Alzheimer’s Disease patients. miR-29 is recognized to target many of the genes in the AD pathways including
BACE1, NAV3, and IFITM3.
 To evaluate the functional importance of miR-29, we generated mice in which miR-29 can be conditionally
deleted. Mice deficient for miR-29 in the brain are born normal but then progressively decline, exhibiting
neurological defects and early lethality. These results show that miR-29 is physiologically important for the
maintenance of long-term homeostasis in the adult brain. Reduction in miR-29 levels could therefore increase
the vulnerability of mature neurons to become dysfunctional in the context of AD.
 We have recently generated mice in which miR-29 levels can be conditionally reduced in the adult brain.
Thus, the overall focus of our proposal is to define the consequences of miR-29 reduction in the adult brain and
to evaluate the therapeutic potential of miR-29 for AD. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will conduct single-cell RNA-
seq analysis to identify the specific cell types that are most impacted by miR-29 reduction in the adult brain.
We will also examine if miR-29 reduction causes changes in dendritic spine morphology and neuronal
arborization in the adult brain. Our results have revealed that an essential function of miR-29 is to regulate
non-canonical (non-CG), CH methylation in the mature brain via its targeting of the methyltransferase
Dnmt3a, where the loss of miR-29 results in CH hypermethylation and reprogramming of gene expression. In
Aim 2, we will examine if CH hypermethylation is a common feature of AD in three distinct mouse models of
AD and AD patient brain samples. Our hypothesis is that restoring miR-29 levels would have therapeutic
benefit for AD. Thus, in Aim 3, we will examine whether AAV-mediated delivery of miR-29 confers benefit in
human stem cell and preclinical mouse models of AD.
 Overall, we are excited to be working on a molecule, miR-29, that has a unique and essential function in
the mature brain. Our studies will help define its mechanisms of action as well as evaluate its therapeutic
potential in the context of Alzheimer’s Disease."

This project is focused on gaining conceptual and mechanistic insights into immune mediators that contribute to
the development of protective immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in human lung and lung-
draining lymph nodes. Although tuberculosis (TB) typically manifests as a pulmonary disease, thoracic lymph
nodes are the most common sites of extrapulmonary Mtb infection. Mtb can be reactivated in lymph nodes,
leading to the formation of granulomas and Mtb dissemination to the lungs and other organs. Yet, the lymph
node response to Mtb in humans remains understudied. A key feature of Mtb pathogenesis is granuloma
formation; finely tuned immune responses within these structures determine localized infection outcomes. Here,
we aim to perform a comparative assessment of the immune (specifically, T cell) responses within human
pulmonary and lymph node granulomas that are successful and unsuccessful in eliminating Mtb. To accomplish
this, we propose to characterize specimens with histological evidence of a granulomatous reaction that (a) show
negative Acid-Fast-Bacilli (AFB) stain but test positive for the presence of TB-DNA by PCR (reflective of
sterilizing immunity or a successful immune response at the granuloma level), and (b) show positive AFB stain
(representing an unsuccessful host effort). Studies in animal models have shown that T cells are important in
controlling the clinical course of TB and that the T cell response to Mtb antigens is initiated in thoracic lymph
nodes and not the lungs. Thus, first, we will test the hypothesis that differences between sterilizing immunity and
unsuccessful responses stem from differences in specific effector T cell phenotypes and functions, and their
spatial organization in the granulomas. Indeed, our preliminary data show that specific CD8+ T cell responses
associate with Mtb clearance at the granuloma level. Our next goal is to use this knowledge to guide the selection
of appropriate antigens to re-elicit this response through vaccination. To accomplish this, we will establish tissue-
mimetic organoids from lymph nodes, which are the staging grounds for cellular immunity following immunization.
We will test the hypothesis that these protective T cell responses that are naturally elicited in granulomas can
be induced in lymph node organoids from TB-naïve donors by specific Mtb (not BCG) antigens. Finally, we will
employ a combination of T cell receptor sequencing and machine-learning algorithms to identify the precise
protective epitopes. Collectively, we expect our results to generate important new insight into the determinants
of immune defense in TB, identify candidates for new TB vaccines, and create opportunities for the management
of the global burden of tuberculosis."

We propose experiments to rigorously investigate whether lncRNAs influence gene transcription programs in the
hippocampus in response to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology, and the potential of lncRNAs to be
therapeutically leveraged to promote memory resiliency in AD.
AD progression involves profound disruptions in gene transcriptional programs in the hippocampus, the brain
region necessary for learning and memory. Epigenetic interventions to enhance memory resilience in AD are
possible. However, it is not well-understood how abnormal epigenetic control of gene transcription contributes
to AD-related memory deficits. We and others have demonstrated that epigenetic chromatin remodeling
mechanisms, like posttranslational modifications of histones, DNA methylation, and non-coding RNAs are crucial
for the regulation of memory-permissive genes in the hippocampus during memory formation. Currently, a
significant gap in knowledge exists regarding the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in memory formation
in the healthy brain and how it is altered in AD-related memory dysfunction. Our long-term goal is to study the
role of lncRNAs in a cell-type specific manner and to identify how these powerful epigenetic regulators impact
memory formation in AD. Our pilot data demonstrate that Neat1 is overexpressed in area CA1 of the
hippocampus from the hAPP-J20 AD model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that inhibiting Neat1 expression in
area CA1 of the hippocampus of the hAPP-J20 AD model reverses memory impairments. Pilot studies also
suggest a strong relationship between histone methylation mechanisms with Neat1 overexpression in the hAPP-
J20 AD model. Based on these preliminary results, we plan to examine the effects of manipulating Neat1 in the
hippocampus and determine effects on AD-related memory decline. To gain further mechanistic insight into
Neat1 mediated gene transcription in the hippocampus of AD mouse models, we will use state-of-the-art
approaches such as single nuclei RNA isolation followed by sequencing and Chromatin Isolation by RNA
Purification to elucidate the cell-type specific epigenetic mechanisms coupled to lncRNAs in our AD animal
models. Our overarching hypothesis is that Neat1 contributes to AD-associated transcriptional changes in
hippocampal cells, hippocampal function, and vulnerability to memory dysfunction. Our Specific Aims are as
follows: Specific Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that Neat1 impacts AD pathology in the hippocampus; Specific
Aim 2: To determine the necessity of Neat1 on AD responsive gene transcription programs in the hippocampus;
Specific Aim 3: To identify the mechanisms by which Neat1 contributes to chromatin restructuring in AD; and
Specific Aim 4: To test whether hippocampal Neat1 dysregulation contributes to AD-related memory
dysfunction. Collectively, these studies will have broad implications for treatment options for AD associated
cognitive decline."

Lyme disease (LD), the most prevalent tick-borne illness in the US (~300,000-475,000 annual cases), is
caused by spirochetes of Borreliella burgdorferi (Bb) sensu lato (s.l.) complex. When early LD diagnosis is
missed, it is left untreated and LD becomes chronic. Human vaccine is unavailable. Antimicrobial treatment of
chronic/persistent infection is often unrewarding. LD may last for years, presenting itself as skin lesions,
arthritis, carditis, and/or Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB). Both central (CNS) and peripheral nervous systems
(PNS) are affected, which results in headache, fatigue, memory loss, depression, facial nerve palsy among
others. The main reason for incomplete understanding of LNB is the limited availability of adequate animal
models. Nonhuman primates are the only model that demonstrates similarities to clinical manifestations of
human LNB. However, issues of cost, reagents availability, non-reproducible genetic backgrounds, and ethical
concerns limit their use. Laboratory mouse strains do not develop neurological clinical signs and encephalitis.
The current knowledge gap is the lack of suitable mouse models of LNB. The overall objective is to develop
mouse model that will be permissive to Bb entry into the CNS/PNS, develop inflammatory lesions in the neural
tissues, and exhibit neurological signs. In the preliminary 3-year-long study, the Collaborative Cross (CC)
resource (32 lines; ~230 mice) was extensively used to identify the mouse model of LNB. The data showed
that over 30% of mice of CC line E, which were infected with Bb for 6 months, including the mouse that
exhibited neurological signs upon Bb infection, developed significant inflammatory lesions in the brain, spinal
cord, and peripheral nerves. In this application, it is proposed to test 4 different Bb strains using the 9 lines that
have already shown Bb infection-induced inflammation in the neural tissues. It is also proposed to include new
8 CC lines that have not been tested, so that a total of 40 CC lines (32+8) will be used to identify genetic
factors contributing to LNB via quantitative trait locus anlaysis. The following Specific Aims will be pursued:
SA1: Determine if CC lines infected with various strains of Bb s.l. will produce distinct LNB
phenotypes.
SA2: Localize genetic factors contributing to LNB.
This approach is innovative s the CC resource has never been utilized in the LD research field. Identifying a
single CC line that consistently shows the presence of inflammation and/or spirochetes in the neural tissues
will be considered a substantial advance in the field of LNB. The mapping resolution is expected to identify
causal regions with confidence, and the number, effect sizes, and relationship among QTL identified will help
guide subsequent investigations and provide the foundation for a future R01 application. The proposed
research is significant because a mouse model of LNB will allow the scientific community to study the LNB
pathogenesis in much greater detail and and provide the foundation for a R01 applications."
10788467,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune disorder characterized by a loss of tolerance
to multiple endogenous antigens, for which there is no cure. Current therapeutic options for SLE patients involve
a variety of non-specific immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory agents that have significant associated side
effects and are often inadequate. There is thus a great unmet need to develop curative therapies for this disease.
In SLE, tissue injury is often mediated by aberrant expression of immunoregulatory signaling proteins. In
particular, Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-2 (SHP-2) has been shown to enhance
disease-active T cell proliferation and promote downstream cytokine production, each of which are innately tied
to the pathophysiology of the disease. The importance of this phosphatase in the promotion of SLE has been
further demonstrated by its inhibition, wherein systemic treatment normalized many of the symptoms of the
disease concomitant with an extension of lifespan. Yet, SHP-2 is expressed throughout the body, thus the
potential for off-target effects from systemic therapies is great. The spleen is the largest secondary lymphoid
organ and an active regulator of the immune response, with a structure designed to increase the likelihood of
rare interactions between cells, in particular cognate lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells. While the spleen
is not considered a target organ in SLE, it is an active site for autoantibody generation and the accumulation of
pathogenic cells, including DNTCs, which are trafficked throughout the body to elicit the observed multi-organ
damage. We thus hypothesize that the localization of therapeutics to the spleen, in particular modulators of
SHP-2, may be sufficient to enable a systemic therapeutic effect. To accomplish this, we propose to utilize
engineered senescent red blood cell mimetic nanohybrids to specifically deliver small molecule inhibitors or
oligonucleotide-based therapeutics to the splenic milieu. If successful, the generated materials may potentiate
the discovery of novel therapeutic options for the treatment of SLE with the capacity for increased specificity and
decreased side effects."
10907460,"The long term goal of this Research Program is to understand how newly translated
proteins fold in eukaryotic cells. The proposed research will focus on folding events as
they occur at the ribosome during synthesis of a polypeptide and will examine the role of
molecular chaperones in their folding process. The conceptual framework for
understanding de novo protein folding originates from our work in the previous funding
cycle, which showed that a network of chaperones named CLIPS (Chaperones Linked to
Protein Synthesis) is physically and functionally linked to the translation machinery. Our
working hypothesis is that the CLIPS chaperones are tasked with guiding newly
synthesized polypeptides to their folded conformation. Chaperone-mediated folding
pathways appear to involve the cooperation of different classes of CLIPS, including
chaperones that act early in the folding process, such as the Nascent Chain Associated
Complex (NAC), the Hsp70 proteins and the GIM/prefoldin complex, and the
mechanistically distinct chaperone TRiC/CCT, which appears to act later in the folding
process. Our general strategy to elucidate how chaperones mediate the folding of newly
synthesized proteins relies on the close integration of in vitro and in vivo approaches with
computational biology analyses. Our proposed experiments are aimed at obtaining
functional, mechanistic and structural insights into the role of chaperones in de novo
folding."
10758599,"Title: Potential of tissue kallikreins as therapeutic targets for neuropsychiatric lupus
Project summary:
Neuropsychiatric lupus (NPSLE) is one of the most common manifestations of human SLE. Symptoms in NPSLE
include anxiety, depression and cognitive impairment that present within one year of lupus diagnosis. IFN  (a
Type I IFN), used as a therapeutic in certain diseases, causes development of depressive symptoms. We have
shown that the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) [comprised of kallikreins (klks), bradykinins (BKs)] and angiotensin
converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi’s), suppressed Type I IFN responses in murine dendritic cells (DCs) from
normal and lupus-prone mice and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). This phenomenon has
immense importance, as IFN is a central player in lupus pathogenesis. The KKS not only regulates many classic
processes, such as coagulation, angiogenesis, and control of blood pressure, but also inflammation and
regulation of brain functions. ACE degrades BK to inactive peptides, while ACEi’s help to restore BK levels, that
in turn suppress IFN responses. Klks breakdown kininogens to BKs, increasing BK levels. Using the well-
established MRL/lpr and NZBW/F1 lupus-prone mouse models, we showed that short-term oral administration
of captopril [a blood-brain barrier- (BBB) crossing, centrally acting CA-ACEi] decreased IFN responsive genes
(IRGs) in brain, spleen and kidney, decreased neuroinflammation, and improved depressive-like and anxiety-like
behavior. Interestingly, administration of klk1 (a widely expressed tissue klk) in MRL/lpr mice also improved
depressive-like behavior, suppressed IRGs, decreased splenic plasmacytoid DCs, and reduced plasma IFN
levels. Other studies have shown that klk genes are decreased in lupus patients; giving exogenous klk1
ameliorated kidney pathology in mice. Together, these findings suggest that KKS molecules may be used to
control IFN production/responses and other inflammatory responses in SLE and NPSLE. The proposal
aims are to investigate: (1) effects of klk1 on systemic and NPSLE disease outcomes (clinical, pathological,
immunological and behavioral) in the spontaneous MRL/lpr mouse model (2) the immunomodulatory effects of
klk1 in brain cells of lupus prone (MRL/lpr and Sle 1,2,3) and wild type (MRL/wt, B6) mice. Findings from this
proposal will provide a rationale for therapeutic use of klk molecules for systemic lupus and NPSLE."
10774327,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nearly one-third of the 10 million annual tuberculosis (TB) cases worldwide are missed each year. TB
contact tracing is an evidence-based practice that is internationally recommended for finding, treating,
and preventing TB among close contacts of TB patients. Contact tracing is also considered a highly
significant strategy for advancing the WHO and PAHO goal of eliminating TB in moderate-incidence
countries like Colombia by 2050. Unfortunately, large implementation gaps persist. Specifically there is
need for 1) better TB screening and testing tools to overcome the low sensitivity of symptom screening
and the difficulty of collecting sputum in those without cough, and 2) more client-centered
implementation strategies to improve case-finding and linkage to care. In prior work with the Secretariat
of Public Health (SPH) in Cali, Colombia, we introduced client-friendly education materials, home
sputum collection and transport, and molecular testing for TB. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to
further evolution of this service to accommodate telehealth visits, and there is need to further adapt
these tools to client expectations and the new digital health landscape. Two of the most promising
innovations for achieving these goals are pairing next-generation molecular testing with non-sputum
samples like saliva and oral swabs to simplify and improve screening and testing algorithms; and
incorporating chat apps (e.g., WhatsApp) and automated customer support tools (i.e., chatbots) as
mobile health (mHealth) tools to engage, support, and retain household members. Our scientific
approach will be to carry out two cross-sectional studies with nested mixed-methods and design
research to refine and adapt these tools for contact tracing. Our overall objectives are to enhance the
sensitivity, feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of contact tracing, and to prepare for a future
household-randomized implementation trial. We propose two specific aims: 1) To determine the
diagnostic performance of oral samples for TB molecular testing in possible TB patients in clinic and
household settings; and 2) To design and iteratively refine an mHealth strategy for implementing
contact tracing optimized for feasibility, acceptability, usability, and appropriateness. The investigative
team has expertise in TB diagnostics and clinical care, contact tracing, user-centered design, qualitative
methods, and implementation science, and a well-established partnership with the SPH that will ensure
an outstanding environment for the proposed research. These studies will determine if oral samples
are viable for molecular diagnosis of TB and refine an mHealth strategy for household TB contact
tracing, using an innovative design approach that is both theory-informed and community-engaged.
This study will ultimately deliver client-centered implementation components for an mHealth contact
tracing strategy for future evaluation in a randomized, controlled implementation trial."

Substance abuse disorders (SUDs) are a major challenge to individuals and society and are caused by the interplay between genetic factors that shape vulnerability to drug addiction and environmental variables that can trigger and affect the course of these disorders. The goal of this project is to uncover the genetic and genomic mechanisms underlying the propensity for drug seeking and drug addiction. Evidence shows that the vast inter-individual differences in vulnerability to SUDs are strongly related to temperamental traits. We therefore established a unique animal model of temperament that is highly genetic and highly predictive of drug-related behaviors. We selectively bred two lines of rats based on differences in their propensity for exploratory locomotion (EL) in a mildly stressful novel environment. The bred High Responders (bHRs) and bred Low Responders (bLRs) show contrasting spectra of heritable behaviors. Compared to bLRs, bHRs exhibit higher sensation seeking and impulsivity, a greater propensity to sensitize to psychostimulants, and lower thresholds for drug- and cue-induced relapse, reminiscent of human “externalizing disorders”. The bLRs are more prone to anxious and depressive behaviors, more responsive to stress, which triggers drug-seeking behavior. Thus, the two lines model sensation seeking and high reactivity to stress as two paths to SUD. Our working hypothesis is that functional DNA variants, derived from outbred Sprague Dawley founders, account for the current neural and behavioral divergence of the two lines and are relevant to drug addiction. During the past funding period, we have identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) for EL and anxiety behaviors and have uncovered several genes and genetic pathways associated with differences in temperament. Our current goal is to increase our understanding of the genetic architecture of our two selectively bred lines and to focus on specific genes likely to shape the differential propensity for cocaine-seeking. Our Specific Aims (SA) are: 
SA1: Deepen our understanding of the genomic and transcriptional neural activity of the bHR-bLR lines using new technologies to characterize structural variations, chromatin accessibility and single nuclei multiomics.
SA2: Characterize the differential impact of cocaine acquisition on the brains of bHRs vs. bLRs and relate the findings to genetic and genomic differences between them. Use chromatin accessibility/gene expression at the single cell level and spatial transcriptomics to define the neural impact of cocaine with cellular granularity. 
SA3: Identify target genes that play a key role in temperamental differences and/or the response to psychostimulants using stringent convergent criteria. We will characterize their expression and regulation by cocaine in specific cell types and brain areas implicated in addiction. This will lay the groundwork for mechanistic studies that establish their causal role in addiction and will enable future pharmacological interventions. 
Our discoveries will illuminate the genetic and neurobiological links between sensation seeking and psychostimulant abuse in humans and inform precision approaches to the treatment and prevention of SUDs."

 We propose the 1st competitive renewal of our transdisciplinary cardiovascular sciences training
program (CVT32) at the University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS). We will continue to
encompass the full spectrum of cardiovascular (CV) research from basic to population health. This breadth
is part of the UMMS culture of conducting science that makes a difference. The CVT32 is a collaboration
between the Division of Cardiovascular Medicine in the Department of Medicine and the Department of
Population and Quantitative Health Sciences (PQHS) and involves 48 participating faculty from multiple
departments.
 Our two MPIs have different research expertise, with one (Freedman) more in the bench through
phase 1 clinical trials arena and the other (Kiefe) in the phase 2/3 clinical trials (efficacy) through
effectiveness, implementation, and population-sciences arena. Trainees will have mentoring teams
with a lead mentor in their CV area of interest and a co-mentor plus an additional mentor-in-training
representing very different areas of research. The synergism of our CVT32 faculty spanning the entire
spectrum is a unique strength of our CVT32 enabling us to train scientists in a transdisciplinary way,
with bidirectional hypothesis generation. Team mentoring and hands-on research experience through
the entire training period are key components of our CVT32, together with structured coursework and
abundant enrichment activities tailored to the individual trainee. We have a doctoral program and a
Masters of Science of Clinical investigation housed in PQHS, where all CVT32 trainees will each have
their own cubicle, in close physical proximity to researchers across the spectrum.
 Building on the success of our 1st funding period, we propose to enlarge the program by attaining a
steady-state of 4 postdoctoral trainees and 4 predoctoral trainees at a time, with terms of 2-3 years;
and newly adding a 12-week summer research training experiences for 8 medical students/year
enrolled in a 4-year clinical and translational research pathway.
 Thus, our aims are to 1) Expand our successful CVT32 across basic, clinical, and population health
sciences geared towards translating research into effective clinical practice and policy, and generating
new questions spanning the entire spectrum of CV research. 2) Recruit pre-and post- doctoral trainees
forming a diverse group regarding sociodemographics, clinical background, and disciplinary
perspectives. 3) Provide trainees with the individual mentoring, academic training, and technical skills
that will ensure their success as independent investigators as well as contributors to team science. 4)
Provide “hands on” research experiences within transdisciplinary teams that build on the strengths of
the current environment of linkages between UMMS Departments, Centers, and Institutes."
10891501,"The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop precision therapy for PIK3CA-mutant colorectal cancer
(CRC). Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K) are heterodimers consisting of a p110 catalytic subunit and a p85
regulatory subunit. The PI of this application co-discovered that PIK3CA, which encodes p110α, is frequently
mutated in a variety of human cancers, including ~30% of CRC. Most PIK3CA/p110α oncogenic mutations occur
at two hot spot regions, one in the helical domain and the other in the kinase domain. Nearly half of all p110α
mutations are located in the helical domain. Increasing evidence suggests that the helical domain and kinase
mutations exert their oncogenic function through distinct mechanisms. For the helical domain mutations, we
discovered that the oncogenic signal is transduced by two unique pathways. We previously found that the p110α
helical domain mutant protein directly associates with IRS1 independent of p85 to activate PI3Kα-AKT. Now, our
preliminary studies demonstrate that p85β disassociates from the p110α helical domain mutant protein
complexes and translocates into the nucleus. The nuclear p85β stabilizes EZH1 and EZH2, two enzymes that
catalyze histone H3K27 trimethylation. Remarkably, we found that a combination of EZH inhibitor GSK126 with
a p110α-specific inhibitor Alpelisib induced tumor regression of CRCs harboring a PIK3CA helical domain
mutation. Thus, we hypothesize that nuclear p85β promotes oncogenic functions of p110α helical domain
mutations and that simultaneous inhibition of both nuclear p85β function and p110α kinase will be an effective
approach to treat tumors with a helical domain mutation. Two aims are proposed to test the central hypothesis:
1) elucidate the mechanisms by which nuclear p85β promotes oncogenic functions of PIK3CA helical domain
mutations; and 2) determine the efficacy of the combination of GSK126 and Alpelisib using a panel of CRC
patient-derived xenografts with a PIK3CA helical domain mutation. Successful completion of our studies will
demonstrate the combination of GSK126 and Alpelisib as an effective treatment for CRCs with PIK3CA helical
domain mutations in preclinical models and lay a solid foundation for future clinical trials. Moreover, our studies
uncover p85β nuclear translocation as a novel mechanism by which PIK3CA helical domain mutations exert their
oncogenic functions."

cohort enrollment with improved follow-up, phenotyping of life course risk factors, and new neuroimaging and
neuropathology outcomes; (2) support Projects studying the spectrum of healthy functioning to Alzheimer’s and
related dementias in older adults; and (3) expand and improve ACT’s dissemination of data and resources to
the research community. To accomplish these goals, the ACT U19 Program includes three scientific research
Projects, six resource Cores, an External Advisory Board, several committees, and many institutional partners.
Core A: Administrative Core is a required component and will provide overall leadership and oversight to the
entire ACT U19 Program. The Administrative Core will support all Projects and Cores in effective research
organization and communication by providing team-based leadership, clear timelines, measurable milestones,
and administrative policies. We will create private and public websites and plan interactive Program-wide
activities to maintain open communication, collaboration, dissemination, and resource sharing. The
Administrative Core will facilitate collaborations with new investigators and support mechanisms to
meaningfully share ACT U19 Program data. These mechanisms include a state-of-the-art public website with
downloadable datasets with clear documentation; a large, rigorous ACT repository maintained in collaboration
with the Data and Analysis Core to support standardized data sharing; an online Data Query Tool to support
preliminary aggregate data requests; and reliable administrative processes and procedures for new data
requests. Importantly, we will work with the Data and Analysis Core to oversee the logistics, flow, and tracking
of all participant data in the ACT Repository, between Projects and Cores, and with any ACT-related ancillary
studies. The Administrative Core will provide centralized support of the ACT U19 Program’s logistic and
financial requirements. This includes overseeing day-to-day activities; communicating with the National
Institute on Aging, External Advisory Board, and supporting committees; and setting the Program’s policies,
governance, communication methods, and administrative procedures. Finally, we will undertake a biannual
evaluation to improve ACT U19 Program performance. The evaluation will focus on the extent of integration,
quality of communication, and scientific productivity across the entire U19 Program to promote best practices
in communication, administration, and implementation of research activities. The Administrative Core is the
operational backbone of our ACT U19 Program and includes a strong senior leadership team with several
small, nimble committees to effectively manage work across all Projects and Cores. We will modernize and
improve many of our current administrative procedures and policies to ensure a smooth transition from the U01
to the larger U19 Program. Given our prior experience in leadership, collaboration, and research project
coordination, we are confident that this Administrative Core can lead the ACT U19 Program to success."

University of Alabama at Birmingham O’Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center (UAB OCCC) presents a distinct
opportunity to build on our accomplishments in education of future cancer research scientists, with an emphasis
on underrepresented racial/ethnic minorities, and to advance cancer research at all three institutions with a focus
on cancer disparities in the context of a bidirectional engagement with urban and rural communities in Alabama
and Georgia. For this U54 Partnership, evaluation will be conducted by a team of evaluators representing each
partnering institution, who meet monthly to discuss progress, issues, and solutions: Dr. Isabel Scarinci and Ms.
Sylvia Peral (UAB OCCC), Dr. Desiree Rivers (MSM), and Mr. Lecarde Webb (TU). Although they will work
together, each will be primarily responsible for specific Cores and Shared Resources. This team makes
recommendations to be implemented administratively by the Principal Investigators with the advice, guidance,
and direction of each institution’s Executive Committee, the Partnership Leadership Committee (PLC), the
Internal Advisory Committee (IAC), and the Program Steering Committee (PSC). Each Core, Research Project,
and Shared Resource of this Partnership will have its own evaluation plan/worksheet outlining the evaluation
questions for each specific aim, tasks, data collection tools, the person responsible for each task, and timeline.
Process evaluation results will be discussed monthly at the PLC meetings, and comprehensive yearly written
reports will be shared with the IAC and PSC for feedback and guidance. It should be noted that, although each
component will have its own evaluation plan, an integrated evaluation process will be conducted to synergize all
components to achieve the long-term goal of eliminating cancer health disparities."
10908314,"PROGRAM SUMMARY: RESEARCH EDUCATION CORE
(This Core is identical for all three Partnering Institutions)
The Partnership between Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM)/Tuskegee University (TU)/University of
Alabama at Birmingham O’Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center (MSM/TU/UAB OCCC) presents a distinctive
opportunity to build on our successful accomplishments in education of future cancer research scientists moving
through our pipeline, with an emphasis on underrepresented racial/ethnic minorities. In this U54 renewal
application, we propose a seamless integration of our cancer education programs by focusing on “hard”
(structured courses/training developed through previous U54 funding) and “soft” skills (e.g., career
development roadmap, interviewing skills) needed to facilitate movement through our pipeline into the cancer
research continuum, with the goal of having a diverse workforce in cancer research. This will be accomplished
through the following specific aims: Aim 1. To develop and implement integrated cancer research education
programs to link high school, undergraduate, and graduate/medical students with postdoctoral fellows, medical
residents, and Early Stage Investigators (ESIs), and senior-level researchers/mentors with a particular focus on
underrepresented racial/ethnic minorities in science. Four integrated programs will be utilized: (a) the Granting
Research Opportunities in Wellness by Creating Exciting Learning Laboratories in Science (GROW CELLS)
for high school students; (b) the Cancer Research Immersion Student Program (CRISP) for undergraduate
students; (c) the Summer Cancer Research Education Program (SCREP) for graduate and medical students;
and (d) the Health Disparities Research Education Program (HDREP) for medical residents, postdoctoral
fellows, and ESIs. Aim 2. To link all levels of cancer research scholars with the Outreach Core to share their
research findings with community members, obtain community feedback on relevant topics for future research
(e.g., Cancer Info Cafés), and develop publications and communications for lay audiences (e.g., blogs or posts
on social media, YouTube videos, policy briefs). Aim 3. To implement a mixed-method, triangulated evaluation
of the proposed research education activities across the pipeline. These efforts will increase the recruitment and
retention of underrepresented minorities in science, specifically in cancer research, that are congruent with the
goals expressed in the NIH’s Interest in Diversity Statement."
10908319,"PROJECT SUMMARY: OUTREACH (This core is identical to all three partnering institutions)
The overall goal of the Outreach Core is to implement and evaluate an evidence-based, theory-informed, multi-
level, clinical trial and cancer genomics education program (CTC-GEP) that addresses the determinants for
African American (AA) and Latinx participation in clinical trials and cancer genomics studies. The CTC-GEP is
informed by the Increasing Minority Participation in Clinical Trials (IMPaCT) program, an efficacious clinical trials
navigator program implemented at the University of Alabama at Birmingham O’Neal Comprehensive Cancer
Center. We will build on the findings of this program and extend application of the patient navigation model to
participation in clinical trials and genomic cancer research. A cadre of lay community navigator professionals
will be trained and serve as clinical trials navigators (CCN) to deliver two unique types of toolkits comprised of
evidence-based educational resources on research participation (low-tech) and culturally tailored educational
and multiple media content via mobile tablet technology (high-tech). The CCNs will deliver these toolkits and
provide logistical support to participants interested in participating in cancer research in rural and urban
community health and academic research centers within the Partnership catchment areas. The CTC-GEP will
also address AA and Latinx beliefs, values, attitudes, concerns, and preferences related to participation in
research, such as privacy, trust, and safety. An evaluation plan based on a logic model will be applied throughout
the project. Outcome measures will be assessed through pre- and post- surveys. The outcomes of the CTC-
GEP include a) intentions to participate in research, b) awareness and knowledge about research, and c)
genomic research and clinical trial enrollment. Additionally, having a Joint Clinical and Biomedical Research
Advisory Roundtable (JCAR) guided, clinical community navigation and education program will lead to increased
awareness, opportunity and participation in genomic research and clinical trials among a diverse population of
AAs and Latinx. The rationale for this Core, intended to facilitate research and not conduct research, is to identify

PROJECT SUMMARY
The Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) U19 Research Program’s overarching goal is to use a life course
approach to investigate modifiable and other factors that influence cognition and Alzheimer’s disease and
related dementia, including better understanding of underlying mechanisms. The Life Course Core provides
data and theoretical support for this goal. The Core leverages existing Kaiser Permanente Washington
(KPWA) electronic data files and medical records, existing ACT data, new survey instruments, and data in the
public domain. By efficiently building on the extensive resources of ACT as a long-standing longitudinal cohort
set in a health care delivery system, the Life Course Core will support scientific inquiry to enhance our
understanding of aging, especially brain aging and dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. The interdisciplinary
Core team with expertise in life course epidemiology, the built environment, neuroscience, and health policy
and econometrics will support the life course framework in all Projects and Core activities. The Life Course
Core’s Specific Aims are: Aim 1) To aggregate data from disparate sources (including administration of a
questionnaire and linkage to external data sources) to characterize socioeconomic status over the life course;
Aim 2) To test the hypothesis that specific crucial times in brain development and function determine the timing
of the relevance of individual and area level socioeconomic status indicators to cognitive trajectories in late life;
and Aim 3) To assist the Projects in identifying relevant life course parameters from newly collected and
existing variables and partner with Cores to integrate the most influential variables into their analyses to
understand the spectrum of robust cognitive function to dementia. Integrating new social and health data over
the life course will allow this Core to work with other cores to support aims across the three Projects and
broader scientific endeavors. We will work particularly closely with the Clinical Core and the Data and

in all Partnership projects, at every stage of research, through collaboration with the Research Education and
Outreach Cores; (2) To collaborate in teaching graduate/undergraduate courses in bioethics, health disparities
and health policy, and bioethics in biosciences, and facilitating discussions of ethical issues in clinical trials
through the utilization of the bioethics experts across the three partner institutions; (3) To endow community
stakeholders, patient advocates, students, and investigators across all Cores and Projects with tools needed to
design, conduct, and manage ethical and culturally sensitive clinical studies through the implementation of an
e-Course on Good Clinical Practice (GCP) in social and behavioral cancer research; (4) To facilitate the ethical
engagement of study participants in medically underserved urban and rural areas of Alabama and Georgia,
addressing issues of trust/mistrust and the informed consent process in clinical and genomic studies; and (5)
To leverage the expertise and bioethics facilities at TU, MSM, and the UAB OCCC to conduct projects that
address bioethical issues in biomedical, social, and behavioral cancer research involving racial and ethnic
minorities. Expansion of these advances to the national level will be via presentation of a conference on ethical
issues in cancer research. Appropriate methods for achieving the stated aims are described in the Research
Strategy section. Planning and evaluation of outcomes are detailed in the Logic Model."
10876377,"SUMMARY
The Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) Neuropathology (NP) Core (Core D) has been a valuable and frequently
utilized resource for the ACT cohort and supports the ACT Repository where the most generous gift to science
– a person’s brain – is used to maximize impact on local and national science of Alzheimer’s disease and
related dementias (ADRD). The NP Core has instituted rapid protocols designed for cutting edge molecular cell
profiling and has markedly extended sampling strategies to better capture regional changes that underlie the
heterogeneity of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. The NP Core has fostered development of
innovative, highly quantitative approaches to assess the neuropathology of ADRD, building on this important
tradition by integrating imaging technologies and analytical approaches to target and quantify gross and
microscopic pathology. We perform post-mortem MRI on every brain, generate 3D virtual brain reconstructions
leveraging unique brain sectioning techniques in the NP Core, scan slides of prospective and archival ACT
samples for traditional quantitative image analysis supplemented with deep learning approaches to maximize
information yield, and leverage multiplexed solution-phase assays from fixed-tissue protein extracts to
compare cytoarchitectural and biochemical pathologic changes in ADRD. All of these innovations are designed
to enable us to deeply characterize the structural substrate for ADRD heterogeneity, mechanisms of resilience
and resistance, and the biological basis of cognitive subtypes and functional variations in brain aging and
dementia in support of each of the ACT Cores. We combine this comprehensive analysis of human brains with
a leptomeningeal cell resource and neuropathological characterization for mechanistic explorations of AD
pathophysiology (Project 3) and promote existing collaborations focused on characterizing cell type
vulnerabilities in all stages of AD to inform mechanistic, diagnostic, and therapeutic research. The NP Core
interacts with and supports every other ACT U19 Research Program Core and Project through state-of-the-art
diagnostics and has expanded dissection and assessment protocols specifically tailored to support Project 2.
Thus, our Aims reflect our commitment to integrate traditional diagnostic excellence and extensive tissue and
data sharing with radiographically informed extensive sampling and a battery of highly quantitative, molecularly
specific tissue and in silico approaches to precisely measure ADRD neuropathology. Our specific Aims are to
(1) build a highly accessible repository of brain tissue and fluids, (2) provide diagnostic expertise according to
the latest guidelines, (3) develop innovative approaches, and (4) promote durable ADRD research through
support of ACT Cores and Projects. All of our research activities are focused on enhancing the research value
of tissue and body fluid donations from cognitively healthy ACT participants and those along the ADRD
spectrum while ensuring proper safeguards."
10876380,"CORE F. DATA AND ANALYSIS CORE ABSTRACT
The Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) U19 Research Program aims to better understand brain aging and
factors across the life course that influence cognitive outcomes and dementia. The ACT U19 Program will
achieve this aim by leveraging the study’s existing rich longitudinal data and by improving the study’s cohort
diversity, data sources, scientific and methodological scope, and capacity for data sharing. The ACT U19 will
answer new important scientific questions through its three research Projects that involve: understanding
relationships between 24-hour activity patterns and cognitive and functional aging (Project 1); assessment of
factors that differ across cognitively defined Alzheimer’s disease subgroups to better understand heterogeneity
in disease and its impacts (Project 2); and evaluation of the mechanisms by which common medication
classes may impact the brain and cognition (Project 3). To make this research endeavor possible, the ACT
U19 Program includes six resource Cores. Core F: Data and Analysis Core is one of these and plays a key
role by interfacing with all other Cores and Projects. The Data and Analysis Core’s primary functions in helping
the ACT U19 Program achieve its aims are three-fold: (1) manage a secure, multi-domain ACT Repository of
clinical, biological, and electronic health record data that are of the highest quality; (2) provide comprehensive
biostatistical and programmatic support to conduct analyses that answer the scientific questions of interest,
developing methods and innovating as necessary to address project complexities; and (3) facilitate efficient
data sharing with external researchers to promote broad use of ACT U19 data, thus upholding the promise that
this unique, publicly-funded resource holds for increasing understanding of dementia. The Data and Analysis
Core is organized around these three functions by structuring itself into an Informatics Unit, a Biostatistics Unit,
and a Data Sharing Unit. These Units are well positioned for serving these roles because the Core’s members
will be able to leverage their extensive biostatistical leadership experience, their scientific knowledge of
dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, their programmatic know-how and deep knowledge of data relevant for
ACT, and their demonstrated commitment to supporting public research through data sharing. The ambitious
research agenda of the ACT U19 Program requires a Data and Analysis Core team capable of facilitating high-
integrity data collection and sophisticated analytical frameworks that embrace complexity, and we are confident
that we have assembled a team that can meet these challenges and guide the ACT U19 Program to success."
10876382,"Physical activity (PA), sedentary behavior (SB), and sleep all impact cognitive and physical health in aging.
Most research to date has focused on how time spent in each of these behaviors individually impacts health
outcomes. However, interactions of PA, SB, and sleep likely account in part for the tremendous heterogeneity
in aging-related health outcomes, and their optimal balance across the 24-hour day in supporting healthy aging
is not known. This proposal capitalizes upon unique resources available through the Adult Changes in Thought
(ACT) U19 Program to explore the inter-relatedness of PA, SB, sleep, and longitudinal trajectories of cognitive
and physical health. The 24-hour activity cycle paradigm as a model for determining longitudinal inter-
relatedness of PA, SB, and sleep on health outcomes is innovative, as is our proposed collection of device-
based data to complement self-reported outcomes. This project proposes to use a number of innovative
statistical approaches to analyze the complex relationships between the 24-hour activity cycle and trajectories
of cognition and physical functioning. Scientific rigor is supported by objective monitoring of 24-hour behaviors
and builds upon more than two decades of ACT data in a well-characterized clinical population. Measures of
cognitive and physical function will include Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument item response theory
scores, specialized tests of executive functioning and verbal fluency, self-reported activities of daily living, gait
speed, rising from a chair, and grip strength. For Aim 1, we will test bidirectional associations relating cognitive
and physical function to the 24-hour activity cycle using device-assessed measures of PA and SB, and self-
reported sleep. We hypothesize that (a) historically better cognitive and physical function will be independently
associated with higher levels of PA, lower SB, and better sleep in ACT participants, and (b) more PA, less SB,
and better sleep will be independently associated with better future maintenance of cognitive and physical
function. For Aim 2, we hypothesize that (a) historically better cognitive and physical function will be
independently associated with better device-assessed sleep quality and circadian rhythms in ACT participants,
and (b) better device-assessed sleep quality and circadian rhythms will be independently associated with
better future maintenance of cognitive and physical function. For both Aims, we will construct combined 24-
hour activity cycle profiles (based on different balances of PA, SB, and sleep) and explore how profiles are
associated with historical trajectories of and future changes in cognitive and physical function. Collaboration
with other Cores will provide new data about how Life Course and Clinical Core variables influence
associations, as well as new information about relationships between the 24-hour activity cycle and novel
neuroimaging data. Ultimately, our results will provide much needed evidence to inform the development of
guidelines and interventions to promote healthy aging in older adults, potentially including reducing risk for
cognitive decline and late life dementia including Alzheimer’s disease."
10876385,"Clinical heterogeneity is common in late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). This heterogeneity leads to the
question of whether there are biologically distinct subsets of people with Alzheimer's disease. Precision
medicine strategies can categorize people with a condition into subgroups and treat each subgroup differently
to improve overall treatment success. Project 2 addresses whether cognitive data can be used to similarly
categorize “Alzheimer's disease.” The investigators use cognitive testing data from the time of Alzheimer's
diagnosis to define subgroups. They use scores from memory, executive functioning, language, and
visuospatial functioning and compare those scores to each other. The modal pattern has all scores relatively
similar to each other (AD-No Domains). There are four groups where scores in one domain are much worse
than the other domains – AD-Memory, AD-Executive Functioning, AD-Language, and AD-Visuospatial. There
are people who have multiple domains with worse scores (AD-Multiple Domains). The investigators have
previously found important genetic, clinical, and imaging differences that correspond to these subgroups. The
overall goal of Project 2 is to leverage Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) U19 Research Program resources to
further scientific understanding of cognitively defined Alzheimer's disease subgroups. Specific Aims are: Aim 1.
Define the evolution of regional brain atrophy across cognitively-defined subgroups. The investigators will
leverage clinical MRI scans, research MRI scans including some obtained for this project, ex vivo scans, and
3D brain data derived from digital photographs of brain slices at autopsy. Aim 2. Determine neuropathological
change across cognitively-defined subgroups. The investigators will leverage ACT's tremendous
neuropathology resources, including extensive new sampling, digital slide scanning, and approaches that
robustly quantify neuropathology findings including deep learning methods. Aim 3. Determine the clinical,
functional, living situation, caregiver network, and economic ramifications of cognitively defined subgroups. The
investigators will leverage ACT's infrastructure to collect data from extensive medical records, collect new data
from people with Alzheimer's and their families and caregivers, and perform careful quantitative and qualitative
analyses to determine whether there are differences across subgroups in clinical, functional, living situation,
caregiver network, or economic implications. Taken together, these investigations will more firmly establish the
implications of cognitively defined subgroups, furthering our progress towards personalized medicine
approaches to ameliorate the scourge of Alzheimer's disease."
10876388,"PROJECT 3 ABSTRACT
Medications are an important exposure in the life course epidemiology framework that ties the Adult Changes in
Thought (ACT) U19 Program together. Medications for chronic conditions are taken over several years, often
beginning in mid-life, and chronic regimens achieve consistent blood levels, so toxic or protective brain effects
of medication exposures are plausible. The Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study has served as an incredible
resource for cutting-edge dementia pharmacoepidemiology research for over 20 years. We take a multifaceted
approach to examine links between common drugs and brain health by using an array of brain-related measures
in the same cohort to deepen our understanding about these relationships and mechanisms. A considerable
methodologic issue inherent in pharmocoepidemiology research is confounding by indication, where the
condition for which a drug is prescribed is associated with dementia rather than the drug itself. In this Project,
we take an innovative and translational approach to complement our existing pharmacoepidemology methods
by deploying molecular assays that will directly address confounding by indication bias with a cell-based model
using human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neurons (hiPSC-Ns) from ACT participants. The
following Aims will be accomplished by working directly with all Project Cores. Aim 1: Deploy a human stem cell-
based molecular assay to directly test mechanisms of neurotoxicity from anticholinergics (AChs) and address
confounding by indication. We will deploy assays that measure four cellular outcomes: AD pathological
molecules, Ab and pTau; neurotoxicity; and neuronal function. Aim 2: To determine comparative associations of
antihypertensives (AHTs) with dementia and AD (2A), neuropathology (2B), and neuroimaging outcomes (2C),
and test mechanisms of neuroprotection (2D). We will test the hypotheses that after controlling for their effects
on blood pressure, exposure to Ang-II↑ drugs compared with Ang-II↓ drugs is associated with lower risk of
dementia and AD, neuropathology and neuroimaging outcomes. We will test the hypothesis that Ang-II↑ drugs
will have positive effects on cellular outcomes (i.e: Aβ and pTau, neurotoxicity and neuronal function) compared
with an Ang-II↓ drug using the group of hiPSC-derived neurons developed in Aim 1.

The Clinical Resource Core (CRC; Core B) will provide support for human subjects Projects I and III of the
University of Michigan (U-M) Udall Center through recruitment, enrollment, and detailed clinical assessment of
Parkinson disease (PD) subjects and age- and gender-matched control (NC) subjects. A unique feature of the
proposed U-M Udall Center is that it will leverage the unique deeply clinical and neuroimaging phenotyped PD
population from our previous Udall Center (09/2014-08/2020). The cohort of PD subjects comprehensively
assessed in the previous U-M Udall Center cycle will be recruited for additional longitudinal assessments with a
supplemental cohort of new PD subjects. The CRC has standardized methods for data collection, entry, and
verification, as developed by the Biostatistics and Data Management Core (BDMC; Core D), compliant with
HIPAA and IRB regulations. Data collected is consistent with NINDS Common Data Elements to facilitate transfer
of data to the NINDS Data Management Repository using ProFORMS. The CRC will closely collaborate with the
Neuroimaging Resource Core (NRC; Core C) to coordinate in vivo neuroimaging assessments of subjects.
The CRC will serve as the liaison between Project III and the investigators of the Dutch Parkinson and
Cognition (DUPARC) study at the University of Groningen (P.I. Dr. Teus van Laar). The CRC will continue to
foster existing collaborations with the Pacific Udall Center (P.I. Dr. Thomas Montine) and the University of
Rochester Udall Center (P.I. Dr. Ray Dorsey). The specific goals of the CRC are:
1. To recruit, enroll, and retain PD subjects (net enrollment target of N=100 eligible PD subjects) and age- and
 gender-matched NC subjects (N=20) for the U-M Udall Center Projects I and III in support of their scientific
goals.
2. To comprehensively assess all subjects with well-established clinical, motor function, and
 neuropsychological instruments at baseline and follow-up.
3. To provide the organizational structure and operations oversight for the U-M Udall Center Projects I and III
 and interact and coordinate with other Cores to assure prompt neuroimaging assessment (NRC) and data
 transfer and analysis (BDMC).
4. Facilitate and coordinate data transfer from the University of Groningen DUPARC study.
5. Support existing collaborations with other Udall Centers and facilitate transfer of data to and from these Udall
Centers"

The University of Michigan (U-M) Udall Center Biostatistics and Data Management Core (BDMC) provides vital
biostatistical support, data management, and analytics for the Udall Center. Core investigators actively
participate and contribute to the national Udall program and the wider Parkinson’s disease (PD) research
community. Aim 1 of the Core is to provide biostatistical and data management support of the Center projects,
including design of experiments, statistical analyses using modern, state-of-the-art statistical models and analytic
methods, result interpretation, and effective dissemination of research findings. Aim 2 is to provide advanced
methods, analytical capabilities, and expertise in the Center, particularly for integrative multi-modal analyses for
the heterogeneous Udall PD data. We offer training materials and educational opportunities for students, fellows,
junior faculty, and research investigators, and community PD advocates. To ensure uniform formats and
vocabularies that facilitate analyses and sharing of resulting data, the NINDS Parkinson’s Disease Common
Data Elements (CDEs) are used. The NINDS Data Management Resource (DMR) repository requires use of
Global Unique Identifiers (GUIDs) that facilitate data aggregation without exposing/transferring Personally
Identifying Information. Data standardization complies with NINDS Parkinson's Disease Biomarkers Program
(PDBP) protocols for storage and access. U-M Udall Center CDE data will be entered into the PDBP DMR using
NINDS ProForms to facilitate data aggregation and sharing with the broader community. Non-CDE data will be
entered into the 21 CFR Part 11-compliant web-based relational database OpenClinica. The Center website will
provide direct links to access summary statistics (data dashboard), manage community requests for samples
and data, and disseminate research findings and computational protocols. The Biostatistics and Data
Management Core will enhance the research, computational and analytic capabilities of the U-M Udall Center,
facilitate PD-related research locally, and contribute unique clinical, biomarker and imaging data to national
repositories for broad community use. Support for the image-based projects, in particular, will require the
integration and harmonization of data across scanners (PET and MRI) and sites (Udall versus Groningen), the
scans (e.g., [18F]FEOBV, [11C]DTBZ, [18F]Fdopa, T1 anatomical, resting state fMRI, diffusion tensor imaging) and
their ensuing modalites (e.g., gray matter density, cortical thickness, functional and structural connectivity, white-
matter integrity), and time (baseline plus follow-up visits). The Center will deploy a number of analysis techniques
to leverage the diversity provided by this multifaceted data set to identify meaningful associations with important
clinical variables involving cognition and gait. Initial emphasis will be placed on hypothesis-driven investigations
targeting individual brain regions of interest, but may be expanded to encompass networks known to be
implicated more broadly in cognitive and gait-related disorders."
10931694,"PROJECT I: SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD) motor features are common in Parkinson disease (PD),
and a significant cause of treatment-refractory disability. Accumulating evidence implicates cholinergic
systems dysfunctions as significant contributors to gait and balance impairment. During the initial funding
period, we established the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) ligand [18F]FEOBV, which uniquely
assesses cholinergic terminal density in high density regions such as the striatum. Our recent cross-
sectional findings suggest that PwP participants with isolated falls and those with freezing of gait (FoG)
status share common cholinergic deficits in the thalamus (lateral geniculate nucleus [LGN]) and striatum
(caudate) with more extensive striatal, limbic, and prefrontal VAChT reductions in PwP with FoG. Consistent
with Project II preclinical data indicating a critical role for striatal cholinergic interneurons (SChI) in
integration of attentional and motor functions, these data suggest that SChI deficits are a common
denominator in the etiology of falls and FoG. These results emphasize the need to understand PIGD, falls,
and FoG as products of cholinergic projection dysfunctions within the framework of failing Attentional-Motor
Integration (AMI) combined with failures of additional multisensory and cognitive integration.
 Episodic mobility disturbances (falls, FoG) are typically preceded by insidiously developing non-
episodic PIGD features. We have novel preliminary data that cholinergic deficits of the medial geniculate
nucleus (MGN) and the entorhinal cortex (ERC) are robustly associated with non-episodic PIGD deficits,
These results imply a significant role of impaired sensorimotor integration underlying non-episodic PIGD
motor features in PwP. The overarching goal of this project is to investigate the evolution of cholinergic
deficits within multisensory, cognitive and motor integration brain regions and development of
PIGD features in PwP. We hypothesize that this progresses from the MGN and ERC, then LGN and
caudate nucleus, and then more diffuse striatal, limbic and cortical (prefrontal followed by anterior cingulum
and insula) cholinergic deficits. To assess our hypotheses, we propose to perform a prospective cohort
study with [18F]FEOBV brain PET at baseline and 2-year follow-up in PD subjects at risk of conversion to
non-episodic and episodic (falls and FoG) PIGD motor features. Novel insights in cholinergic changes
underlying incident development of PIGD may inform new therapeutic interventions to treat these
debilitating motor complications. Project I is highly integrated thematically with Project II and the Catalyst
Research Project, complementary to Project III, and will interact extensively with all Cores. Our work is
based on a unique, deeply phenotyped cohort of PD participants developed in the prior funding cycle
allowing us to recruit an enriched sample of patients likely to convert to fall and FoG status, allowing
longitudinal within-subject assessments."

 A key component of this P30 application is the ‘Personalized Model System Core’. The models will
include the patient-specific cultures derived from intestinal epithelia (enteroids) and the induced pluripotent
stem cells (iPSCs) from myofibroblasts. These patient specific cultures will be used to study CFTR function
and fluid homeostasis, and the information obtained will be used towards personalized treatment options. The
Personalized Model System core will develop and bank these models, develop and validate the assays for
CF/CFTR research, and distribute the resources to researchers worldwide. The long-term goal of this core is to
use models derived from the patient to facilitate his/her personalized therapy. Specific Aim 1. To provide well-
characterized CF patient-specific enteroids (small bowel and colonic) to local, national, and international
investigators interested in personalized model systems or CF/CFTR-related research. Specific Aim 2. To
provide well-characterized CF patient-specific iPSC-derived tissue from myofibroblasts to local, national, and
international investigators interested in personalized model systems. Specific Aim 3. To provide assay
services and training to local, national, and international investigators interested in personalized model
systems to study the functional involvement of CFTR fluid secretion in intestinal enteroids and spheroids.
 The Core will create resources and sound services that have important long term clinical implications
toward patient-specific therapies for cystic fibrosis. The core will provide training in a variety of state-of-art and
innovative techniques including the development of intestinal stem cells cultures, iPSCs technology, high
content microscopy, to name a few, to researchers who will be able to use these techniques to study not only
CF/CFTR biology but other membrane proteins and their associated diseases."
10865107,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Hypertension contributes to high rates of morbidity and mortality of other chronic conditions, including
cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, and end stage renal disease. African Americans (AAs) are more likely
to develop high blood pressure and at a younger age compared to other racial/ethnic groups, and despite higher
treatment rates, are less likely to have blood pressure under control. Racial disparities persist by sex—AA women
have higher incidence of hypertension and earlier onset compared to their white counterparts. Experiences of
stress, including race- and gender-related stress, and stress-related coping are thought to be at the root of these
disparities. African American women demonstrate greater stress as evidenced by higher allostatic load over the
life course relative to male and white counterparts. Higher incidence and earlier onset of hypertension make
younger AA women a prime target for prevention; however, the development of effective prevention-focused
interventions is inhibited by limited understanding of underlying mechanisms in this subgroup. To fill these critical
gaps, this proposal will use a sequential mixed methods approach, including the following: 1) quantifying stress
responses in vivo using a 14-day ecological momentary assessment (EMA) protocol with 24-hour physiological
monitoring; and 2) developing and testing the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of a stress
management intervention that may mitigate the effects of the chronic stress on blood pressure levels in young
AA women.
 The candidate for this mentored Career Development Award, Dr. Anika L. Hines, is an Assistant Professor
in Health Behavior and Policy at the Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine. Her long term career
goal is to: 1) become an independent investigator who explicates the complex and cumulative effects of stress
in the lived experiences of racial/ethnic minorities within the context of health disparities; and 2) design and
implement innovative, evidence-based interventions and policies to address these stressors using an
interdisciplinary, socioecological approach. During this award, Dr. Hines will undergo rigorous didactic and
research training, including an didactic courses, experiential lab training, and practical research experience, that
will substantially build her skills in intervention development and the conduct of randomized controlled trials for
behavioral interventions. These career development activities will be conducted within the rich training
environment of Virginia's largest academic medical center with direct guidance from mentors, advisors, and
collaborators with expertise in multi-level and behavioral interventions, evidence-based behavioral medicine
approaches, race-related stress, qualitative methods, physiological pathways linking stress and cardiovascular
risks, advanced statistical analyses, health equity, and grant development. These activities will provide Dr. Hines
with a solid foundation to ensure her successful transition to an independent, interdisciplinary investigator who
is well equipped to conduct behavioral intervention trials in service of health equity."

Immersed in the two worlds of clinical practice and research, physician-scientists, particularly those trained
in quantitative social sciences, have unique perspectives that are key to effectively addressing the
healthcare demands of America’s aging population. Harvard University, home to a long established
nationally recognized MD-PhD program as well as world-renowned graduate programs in Health Policy,
Economics, and Social and Behavioral Sciences, is exceptionally well poised to train physician-scientists in
these areas. With the support of this institutional NIA training grant, we have cultivated a growing cohort of
such trainees and are inspiring them to pursue impactful aging related research. Training typically follows a
‘2-4-2’ model: 2 years of medical school, 4 years of graduate school culminating in a PhD with at least one
project focused on aging populations, and then, 2 final years of medical school. While the accent is aligned
with their tuition assignment, students participate in clinical and research training throughout their timeline.
Hallmarks of this training program include regular tutorials run as well as meetings with the directors of the
Marcus Research Institute of Aging. Both opportunities provide students with mentorship, community,
interdisciplinary interactions, exposures to a wide range of social science quantitative methods, and provide
a forum for identifying exciting research questions. Students are appointed to this training grant in the M1,
M2, G1, M3 and M4 years. The G2-Gn years are covered by their respective PhD program. Our
participating PhD programs include 1) the PhD Program in Health Policy (concentrations in Economics,
Management, and Methods for Policy Research), which trains students for research and teaching careers in
health policy through an interdisciplinary and interfaculty approach; 2) the PhD Program in Economics in the
Department of Economics, which prepares students for productive and stimulating careers as economists in
academia or for positions in government, research organizations, or business enterprises; and, 3) the PhD
in Population Health Sciences (field of study in Social and Behavioral Sciences), offered through the
Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, which prepares students to be scholars whose research
illuminates social and behavioral determinants of health and develops and evaluates innovative
interventions and policies leading to the improvement of population health. The 28 participating faculty by
and large possess a strong interest in and experience with mentoring physician-scientist trainees and have
expertise in aging-related research. Within the greater community of ~190 MD-PhD students and ~27 social
science MD-PhD students is now a vibrant and tight knit group of 10 who are part of this NIA training
program. With an existing track record of distinguished alumni and this growing cohort of current trainees,
made possible by this NIA training grant, we submit this competing renewal so that we may continue to
build on these accomplishments."

results. The Yale-DAHRS program has successfully recruited 10 diverse scholars (7 women and 2 URiM)
representing multiple physician disciplines, including Emergency Medicine, General Internal
Medicine/HIV/Hepatology/Pulmonary, Pediatrics/Adolescent Medicine and Obstetrics and Gynecology,
covering the patient life span in a wide range of medical settings and populations. Patients with pre-addiction
and substance use disorders often receive medical care for a complex array of acute consequences and
complications of substance use and chronic conditions in medical settings such as emergency departments
and primary care and specialty clinics. The Yale-DAHRS program provides a comprehensive three-year post-
doctorate, interdisciplinary Mentored Career Development Program that incorporates a robust didactic
research curriculum leading to a Masters in Health Science degree, mentored research and training in topics
related to Addiction Medicine to: [Aim 1] Develop physician scientists with the knowledge and skills to
become independent investigators, generating novel findings to improve drug use and addiction outcomes
through prevention and treatment in medical settings. [Aim 2] Develop future leaders by providing scholars
with skills to ensure success in leading multidisciplinary teams in studying prevention & treatment of drug use
and addiction and their implementation and integration into medical settings; and [Aim 3] Enhance the
diversity of drug use and addiction researchers, and robustly address health equity in all stages of
addiction research. Addressing the representation of women and URiM faculty in the physician scientist
workforce will enhance the diversity of investigators and research topics, broaden perspectives in setting
research priorities, increase trial participation, and expand knowledge. Our program has demonstrated success
capitalizing on the synergies of established training and clinical programs at Yale and our community partners,
and the experiences offered by our seasoned, diverse group of interdisciplinary core faculty, mentors and
advisory committee. Our graduates are all on faculty research tracks, and recognized leaders in their
respective fields. Seven are boarded in Addiction Medicine. They have published and disseminated their
research findings widely, and are all federally funded. This renewal will continue support for 2 current scholars
and will also support 3 new scholars. The proposed renewal benefits from iterative changes to Yale-DAHRS
over time including the addition of formal leadership training/coaching and new approaches to addressing
diversity, equity and inclusion in research to identify disparities and interventions to improve patient outcomes."

 Recent studies have shown that idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD), the second most common
neurodegenerative disorder in the US, may originate in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. From there it spreads via
the vagus nerve to the brainstem and, subsequently, to the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars
compacta (SNpc). Indeed, GI symptoms such as gastroparesis and constipation are prodromal to the onset of
PD. Recently, we discovered a nigro-vagal pathway that connects the SNpc to neurons of the dorsal motor
nucleus of the vagus (DMV) and, upon SNpc stimulation, increases colonic motility. The nigro-vagal pathway is
impaired in an experimental model of PD such that SNpc stimulation increases motility to a lesser extent. We
have also generated a novel rodent model of environmental Parkinsonism, in which oral gavage of rats with
subthreshold doses of the herbicide, paraquat (P), in combination with lectins (L), a sugar binding protein found
commonly in the human diet, induces levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism. Such P+L treatment also induces
generation of pathological α-synuclein in the GI tract, as well as in the DMV and SNpc, with significant
degeneration (~50%) of dopaminergic SNpc neurons. Our preliminary data indicate that P+L treatment also
slowed gastro-cecal transit, attenuated the colonic response to excitation of the SNpc and altered the colonic
response to brainstem dopamine administration. At the same time, DMV neurons become hyperactive to
compensate for the decreased colonic motility.
 Based on our preliminary studies, that demonstrate that chemogenetic blockade of the nigro-vagal
pathway prevents the development of PD, we propose the following novel hypothesis: “α-synucleinopathy-
associated GI hypomotility induces maladaptive plasticity in the nigro-vagal pathway, favoring the progression
of PD”. We further hypothesize that correction of this maladaptive neuroplasticity will forestall parkinsonism. To
investigate this novel hypothesis, we will use a combination of in vivo chemogenetic and electrophysiological,
anatomical and behavioral approaches in rodents to investigate the role of the neural pathways affected in
parkinsonian-related GI dysfunctions and in the etiology of PD."
10815539,"Abstract
An important goal in computational biology is to leverage data from high-throughput functional assays to infer
the biological consequences of genetic variation. This goal is frequently approached by pairing RNA sequencing
and differential expression analysis. Most differential expression methods seek to identify a small number of
genes and gene-sets that are affected by a genetic perturbation. However, some genes, such as chromatin
regulators, may impact thousands of genes across the transcriptome. These dispersed effects are not captured
by existing methods. We will address this methodological gap in the differential expression field by
developing a novel statistical tool, and will apply this tool to both normative and disease contexts. In
Aim 1, we propose the Transcriptome-wide Impact Model (TIM), a parametric likelihood-based estimator of the
overall effect that a perturbation has on the transcriptome. TIM builds on existing differential expression methods,
but estimates parameters of the distribution of differential expression effects, rather than individual per-gene
effect sizes. This model is also extended to estimate gene-set enrichments and correlation between differential
expression signatures. In Aim 2, we aim to apply TIM to a recent Perturb-Seq dataset that perturbs all expressed
genes in vitro in a massively parallel manner, enabling us to identify which genes and gene-sets induce the
greatest transcriptomic change in human chronic myeloid leukemia cell lines when knocked down. We will also
use TIM to identify modules of genes that have similar impact on the transcriptome, and use these modules to
annotate genic function. In Aim 3, we will apply TIM to an in vivo Perturb-Seq dataset of 35 neurodevelopmental
disorder genes in developing mouse neocortex. Through this Aim, we will stratify neurodevelopmental disorder
genes by degree of transcriptome-wide impact, testing the hypothesis that neurodevelopmental-disorder-
associated gene expression regulators exert highly dispersed effects on the transcriptome in brain. If true, this
finding would raise the intriguing question of whether small, dispersed expression effects can be pathogenic,
opening novel avenues for research into neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as many other diseases that are
associated with expression regulators (e.g. cancer). We will additionally use TIM to cluster neurodevelopmental
disorder genes by similarity of transcriptomic effects, to identify genes with putatively convergent mechanism.
Broadly, our model will allow conceptually novel insight to be extracted from differential expression experiments,
with applicability to any biological perturbation of interest."
10837704,"ABSTRACT
It is projected that there will be more than 500,000 childhood cancer survivors (CCS) living in the United States
by 2020. Despite advances in treatment, the majority of CCS will experience a chronic or severe condition as a
result of their treatment known as a “late effect. There is substantial evidence about the long-term effects of
psychological distress, impaired health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and late mortality for CCS. Despite
these serious and long-term health challenges, engagement with recommended survivorship care declines
over time in this at-risk population. Throughout treatment and into long-term survivorship, parents of CCS are
highly involved with medical care and play a role in helping CCS transition from pediatric to adult-focused
survivorship care. Emerging studies suggest that parent’s psychological distress is related to poorer CCS
HRQoL, and that Hispanic/Latino CCS may be at higher risk for such adverse outcomes. These studies
suggest that there may be contextual and cultural factors that influence outcomes for Hispanic/Latino families,
such as acculturation, immigration status, and linguistic aspects. Given the documented impact of treatment on
adverse outcomes such as comorbid conditions and care engagement, and the key caregiving role that
parents play for CCS, examining the relationships between parents, CCS, and medical providers is critical to
identify ways to improve long-term care engagement for young adult CCS, particularly those at high risk for
poorer outcomes such as ethnic minorities. The premise of the proposed research is that multi-level factors
contribute to disparities in HRQoL and survivorship care among diverse populations of adult CCS. During my
dissertation research (F99 phase), I focus on how survivor-caregiver dyads manage cancer, share appraisal,
and how collaborative management of cancer optimizes both parent and child mental health among an
ethnically diverse population with a focus on Hispanic/Latino families. During the K00 phase, I will extend this
research and training by developing expertise in understanding healthcare system and policy-level factors that
contribute to disparities in cancer survivorship. Results from this proposal will yield important information about
how individual, interpersonal, cultural, and healthcare system factors impact medical decision-making and
psychosocial health among an understudied and high-risk cancer population. The proposed F99/K00 proposal
is also a priority area of scientific research under the Childhood Cancer Survivorship, Treatment, Access and
Research (STAR) Act and is aligned with current NCI funding for intervention research to support pediatric and
adolescent and young adult cancer survivor and caregivers. Ultimately, completing this integrated training will
allow me to apply the skills learned at a research-intensive university, where I am at the forefront of research to
build healthier communities, and develop new ways to address challenging cancer-related health problems,
especially among historically marginalized and underserved populations."

chemist with relevant expertise in protein structure and function. Essential components of this research
include both the creation of modeling techniques that can be used effectively with existing experimental
data, and the collection of new data to validate our modeling work. This work will result in a collection of
novel methods for the study of protein aggregation that are both statistically principled and empirically
grounded, as well as biologically relevant empirical data."

Ca2+ signaling mediates many essential roles in the brain including neurotransmitter release, synaptic
plasticity, and gene transcription. Neurons and glia have an extensive Ca2+ signaling toolkit that includes
many types of ion channels and Ca2+ release pathways which can be mixed and matched to create
signals with widely different spatial and temporal properties. One of the newest - and least understood
- members of this toolkit in the brain is store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). SOCE is mediated by the
opening of Orai channels (Orai1-3), which are activated by the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ sensors,
STIM1 and STIM2. In immune cells where SOCE was first discovered, the pathway mediates critical
functions including gene expression and cytokine release, and aberrant Orai/STIM function is implicated
in the etiology of several diseases including immunodeficiency, inflammation, and myopathy. However,
in the brain where multiple isoforms of Orai and STIM are expressed, the molecular mechanisms and
physiological functions of SOCE remain very poorly understood. Previous work on the molecular
choreography of SOCE has revealed that Orai channel opening is triggered by a unique inside-out
mechanism where store depletion activates the ER Ca2+ sensors STIM1 and STIM2 which then
translocate to ER-plasma membrane contact sites to directly gate Orai1 channels. Our previous
mechanistic work has established a strong framework for understanding the gating mechanisms of Orai
channels, and using conditional Orai1 and STIM1 knockout mice, we have now begun to discover vital
roles for Orai channels in effector functions in the brain such as NFAT-mediated gene expression,
synaptic plasticity, and memory. We have learnt that SOCE in neurons exhibits unique specializations,
including rapid activation and unusual Ca2+ dependencies whose basis cannot be readily explained
easily from existing activation models. In this application, we aim to build an integrated view of the
SOCE mechanism in the nervous system, its micro and macro architecture, regulation, and gating, and
elucidate how neurotransmitter and receptor signaling through SOCE impacts fundamental processes
of synaptic communication, metabolism, learning, and cognition. To address this goal, we will use a full
range of approaches from electrophysiology, structural analysis, and molecular dynamics simulations
to behavioral analysis of cognition, depression, and disease to gain an unprecedented view of the SOCE
mechanism in the brain. These studies will address the role of a poorly understood Ca2+ entry pathway
in the nervous system with immense relevance for a range of functions from cognition to pain, and
ultimately facilitate efforts to target Orai channels for drug discovery for neurological diseases."

The overarching goal of my research program is to understand how hormones shape the neural
pathways that control social behavior. Gonadal hormones are key regulators of development
and adult neural function, and their signaling leads to profound differences in vertebrate animal
reproductive and aggressive behaviors across sexes. Differences in hormone signaling across
men and women could contribute to discrepancies in incidence of neuropsychiatric conditions,
but the neuronal and transcriptional basis for their actions are not clear. These hormones may
determine the connectivity of cells, their activity patterns, or both. Reproductive behaviors in
cichlid fish are an ideal model system to understand how hormones impact gene transcription
and neural circuit function. Cichlid social behaviors have been studied for nearly a century, and
are complex yet stereotyped and quantifiable. Dozens of cichlid species have sequenced
genomes, and we have pioneered CRISPR gene editing and transgenesis in these species. We
have identified a population of neurons sensitive to the hormones progestin and prostaglandin
F2α (PGF) that is essential for spawning behavior. Progestin receptor (PR) signaling regulates
gene expression in these cells, while PGF and its receptor, Ptgfr, are sufficient and necessary to
initiate spawning. We seek to determine the contribution of Ptgfr+ cells to a variety of social
behaviors through genetically directed manipulation of these cells. The implementation of the
QF-QUAS system for the first time in cichlids will permit studies of these and other cells. Like
other steroid hormone receptors, PR acts as a ligand-activated transcription factor. However, its
genomic targets are not known in brain, and so it is not clear how it regulates behavior. We will
identify how PR regulates cichlid behavior routines and determine the genomic targets of PR
that underlie its actions. The production of progestin (and other steroids) is regulated by the
hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Sensory inputs regulate the production of progestin in
cichlids: male odorants promote its synthesis. We will identify cell groups that mediate this
signaling from olfaction to the endocrine system. These approaches will build upon our previous
findings and leverage technologies that we have developed, together yielding insights into how
the vertebrate brain regulates and responds to sex hormones. These experiments will lay a
foundation for understanding the gene networks coordinated by hormones and delineating the
neurons that regulate social behaviors."

The poor immunogenicity of the HIV envelope spike and its vast variability represent major obstacles for efficient
elicitation of protective anti-HIV antibodies. One promising strategy is to bypass the immune system and deliver
already known and well-characterized potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies directly to the host. However,
periodic administrations of large amounts of protein would be required for long-term effects. Recombinant adeno-
associated virus (AAV) vectors have been widely used for gene delivery applications because of their safety and
cost-efficiency: one single injection can account for long term expression of the transgene. The use of AAV
vectors would bypass the need for periodic administrations of antibody and, as long as the delivered protein is
viewed as self, it can result in continuous durable expression. Studies in monkeys and in mice have already
shown the extreme promise of AAV for this antibody delivery approach against HIV, and pioneer human trials
have demonstrated its safety and feasibility. However, only antibodies in IgG form (monomeric immunoglobulin)
have been employed in such AAV-antibody delivery applications, while polymeric immunoglobulins (such as
dimeric IgA and pentameric IgM) have been overlooked, despite their desirable characteristics for mucosal
protection. In addition, little is known about what proportion of circulating AAV-delivered antibody gets transferred
to relevant viral entry points such as the rectal or vaginal mucosae and how that correlates with the level of
protection against mucosal exposure that can be achieved. Building up on our previous monkey trials, what we
propose here is to evaluate AAV-mediated delivery of a potent and broadly neutralizing antibody as different
immunoglobulin types and assess the degree of protection that can be achieved to mucosal viral challenge by
each type (Aim 1). We will use the highly relevant macaque model and quantitate in vivo AAV-produced antibody
in circulation and in the relevant mucosae. Our goal is to find what immunoglobulin type shows optimal transfer
of the AAV-delivered antibody to the viral point of entry in mucosae and/or optimal protection against challenge.
Because HIV is mainly transmitted sexually, our findings will be highly relevant in the fight against HIV
transmission. Our overall goal is to inform and guide development of the AAV-antibody concept for its use in
people."

The North American Primary Care Research Group proposes promoting, convening, coordinating,
managing, evaluating, and disseminating the results of the 19th, 20th, and 21st meetings of the Practice-
Based Research Networks (PBRNs) in the summers of 2023, 2024 and 2025. With a projected attendance
of 125, the purpose of the annual two-day conference will be to build on the skills and knowledge of
clinicians, researchers, and community partners in evidence-based research to improve the health of the
U.S. population, healthcare delivery systems, and the quality of primary health care. Along with sharing
translatable insights emanating from research, the conference will link research with clinical practice–
especially primary care practice—by facilitating collaboration among conference attendees, policymakers,
and funders. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) support for the PBRN conferences
help in achieving the goal of improving health care for all Americans, including the priority populations. The
conference allows practitioners to acquire the necessary evidence, interventions, and dissemination to
make better decisions and deliver exceptional, accessible, equitable, affordable, and patient-centered
health care.
NAPCRG has successfully hosted the 2012-2022 PBRN conferences, including 2 virtual conferences due
to COVID-19, and attracted an average of 140 attendees. With input from a Steering Committee (SC)
experienced with PBRNs and prior PBRN conferences, each year, NAPCRG will select a conference
theme and plenary speakers and select papers, workshops, and poster presentations through a call for
abstracts. Conference sessions will address the science of research and operation of PBRNs and provide
for presentation of studies focusing on practice and quality improvement, COVID-19, behavioral health,
patient safety, health information technology/electronic health records, telemedicine, and issues in primary
care practice, and prevention.
NAPCRG will manage all conference logistics—including a call for abstracts, conference
promotion, registration, continuing education accreditation, conference evaluation, and social media
strategy. The proposed conferences will provide skill-building, knowledge transfer, brainstorming future
research agendas, collaboration, and outcomes to a diverse mix of stakeholders."
10894781,"Between 15 and 20% of couples have difficulty conceiving; failures of the reproductive system thus affect many
individuals. In females, understanding the control of ovulation is critical for helping infertility patients conceive
single vs multiple births while minimizing side effects. Psychosocial stress interferes with homeostasis and
disrupts many physiologic systems including reproduction. Completing this research will help us understand
how the brain responds to ovarian estradiol to generate the central neural signal that ultimately leads to
ovulation and how stress disrupts this. The signal for ovulation is provided by a change in the output of
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons from strictly episodic, producing on/off GnRH pulses that
drive pituitary hormone release, to a surge mode in which GnRH release is continuously elevated for hours. To
induce the GnRH surge, estradiol action switches from negative to positive feedback. Ovariectomized (OVX)
mice treated with constant physiologic levels of estradiol (OVX+E) undergo daily shifts from negative to
positive feedback that are timed to the light-dark cycle, allowing mechanistic studies of estradiol action in a
reduced variable model. In cycling ovary-intact mice, this switch in estradiol feedback mode occurs on
proestrus. Our previous work indicates cyclical changes in estradiol induce cycle-dependent changes in the
properties of the hypothalamic neurons involved in generating the GnRH surge. This work established several
mechanisms engaged by estradiol that would lead to suppression of GnRH neurons during negative feedback
and activation of these cells during positive feedback. In the proposed work, we will expand upon this base in
experiments that range from continued investigation of neurobiological mechanisms to whole animal studies,
all aimed at elucidating estradiol feedback and GnRH surge generation, and the effects of stress on this
system. In Aim 1, we will study estradiol modulation of three important circuits: from kisspeptin neurons in the
anteroventral periventricular (AVPV) nucleus to GnRH neurons, from arcuate kisspeptin to AVPV kisspeptin
neurons, and among AVPV kisspeptin neurons. These experiments will move us towards understanding a
more complete reproductive neuroendocrine network by studying how synaptic properties are modulated by
estradiol. In Aim 2, we will study the mechanisms by which acute stress exposure in adulthood perturbs the
shift from estradiol negative to positive feedback, disrupting the LH surge. We will test involvement of the
adrenal glands and of neurons producing corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). We will examine how acute
stress mechanistically changes estradiol positive feedback effects on GnRH neurons. Finally, we will test how
the stress neuroendocrine axis interacts with the reproductive neuroendocrine axis by examining connectivity
between CRH and GnRH neurons and CRH and kisspeptin neurons and their modulation by estradiol. These
studies will increase our understanding of the hypothalamic networks regulating reproductive function and how
disturbances of homeostasis can interfere with the normal operation of these networks."
10890656,"My lab seeks to understand the cell biophysical mechanisms regulating transmembrane signal transduction, i.e.
signal transfer from ligands to receptors to downstream effectors. There is mounting evidence that cell surface
receptors and associated proteins exhibit a high degree of dynamic organization at the plasma membrane (PM),
which is critical for their ligand binding and signaling. However, many fundamental questions remain
unanswered. Toward filling this gap in our knowledge, my lab will pursue two research directions over the next
five years. The first direction will investigate how focal adhesions, the actin cortex, and interactions with integrins
regulate the spatiotemporal organization and signaling of the endothelial cell receptor VEGFR2. VEGFR2 is the
main promoter of angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels from existing vessels) in both normal
physiology and disease. Thus there is great interest and need to understand the mechanisms that regulate its
signaling. These studies will reveal mechanisms that underlie the activation of multiple pathways downstream of
VEFR2, and that underlie the integration of multiple external signals at the level of the PM. As VEGFR2 belongs
to the large family of receptor tyrosine kinases, our studies are expected to reveal general principles of the
regulation and signaling of this important family of receptors. The second direction will focus on the novel
organizational principle of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) for proteins at the PM, using the transmembrane
protein LAT as a model system. LAT is critical for the activation and immune function of T cells upon encountering
an antigen presenting cell. Recent in vitro reconstitution work suggests that signaling clusters composed of LAT
and its downstream effectors are formed through LLPS. The cellular environment is however much more
complex than an in vitro reconstituted system. Thus we will investigate to what extent LAT microclusters at the
PM of T cells are formed through LLPS, and the mechanisms that regulate LAT cluster composition. These
studies will shed light on the role of LLPS for protein organization within the cellular environment in general. Both
research directions – by their very nature – require probing molecular activities with high specificity and resolution
in their native cellular environment. To achieve this, we will develop integrative approaches based on live-cell
single-molecule, super-resolution and activity biosensor imaging, combined with cutting-edge mathematical and
statistical analysis tools to extract quantitative information from the experiments and to multiplex the
complementary information that the different imaging modalities provide. These analytical tools will be critical for
our studies because single-cell and single-molecule microscopy often reveal molecular and cellular
heterogeneity that is difficult to digest without such tools. We expect our novel analytical tools to be broadly
applicable to other systems studied via similar experimental approaches. The knowledge gained from our studies
will provide the building blocks for deepening our understanding of cell signaling from the single-molecule level
to the systems level."

Lupus nephritis (LN) is a common and severe complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and
current therapies are toxic and frequently ineffective. LN is more prevalent and more likely to cause kidney
failure in African American patients [1-3]. SLE has strong genetic components, but the relationship of
genetic susceptibility to prognosis in African Americans is poorly understood. Previous studies showed
variants of TNIP1 are associated with SLE and LN susceptibility [4-7]. We reported a strong association for
the TNIP1 rs4958881 polymorphism with LN in African American patients from a large-scale SLE
genotyping study [8]. Our preliminary data show an association of the rs4958881 variants with severity and
progression of LN in African Americans. TNIP1 encodes the protein ABIN1 that functions as a physiological
inhibitor of NF-κB, a prominent immune regulator [9, 10]. We reported previously that loss of the molecular
function of ABIN1 in mice results in SLE-like autoimmunity and glomerulonephritis [8, 11, 12].
While there is evidence that ABIN1 regulation of NF-B plays a role in autoimmunity and development of
LN, a number of critical gaps in knowledge remain. First, what molecular mechanisms mediate ABIN1-
dependent enhanced risk of LN, and are they specific for different immune cell types? Second, does altered
ABIN1 function induced by TNIP1 polymorphisms play a role in the racial disparity of LN? Third, do TNIP1
polymorphisms have different pathologic, molecular, and cellular effects in African Americans compared
with White Americans?
Three Specific Aims are proposed to address these significant questions. Aim 1: Compare the Association
of theTNIP1 variant rs4958881 on LN in White and African Americans. Aim 2: Determine the effects of the
TNIP1 variant rs4958881 on monocyte, neutrophils, and B cell activity in patients with LN. Aim 3. Determine
the mechanisms by which loss of ABIN1 molecular function alters monocyte, neutrophil, and B cell function
using ABIN1 transgenic mice. The animal experiments will be interpreted in conjunction with similar
experiments in Aim 2 using the same cells isolated from blood of LN patients with the TNIP1 rs4958881 risk
variant.
This is a Multi-PI proposal with a Cell and Molecular Biologist/Biochemist (Dr. David W. Powell) and a
Clinical Nephrologist/Scientist (Dr. Dawn J. Caster). These investigators have published many of the
reports pertaining to TINIP1/ABIN1 function in LN via genetic and animal studies and are now poised with
recent preliminary findings to evaluate causative roles for a TNIP1 polymorphism in severity and
progression and specific cellular and molecular events in human LN. The translational and population-
targeted nature of these studies will provide impactful insights that will lead to precision diagnostics and
therapeutics for high-risk African American LN patients."

The genetic study of severe human congenital cerebrovascular anomalies can shed insight into mechanisms of
normal vascular development and identify targets for therapeutic intervention. Vein of Galen aneurysmal
malformations (VOGMs) are the most common and severe of pediatric brain arterio-venous malformations
(AVMs). Significant gaps in our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of VOGMs impede the
development of improved diagnostic and therapeutic measures. Locus heterogeneity and the sporadic nature
of VOGM cases have constituted fundamental obstacles to VOGM gene discovery. We recently applied whole
exome sequencing (WES) to overcome these obstacles and identified de novo and inherited gene mutations
that account for ~30% of sporadic VOGM cases (Duran et al., Neuron, 2019). These included a genome-wide
significant burden of rare, damaging mutations in EPHB4 (EphB4), a critical regulator of arterio-venous
specification also mutated in the familial AVM syndrome, capillary malformation (CM)-AVM type II (CM-AVM2).
We also discovered new mutations in other genes that function in the same Ephrin signaling interactome,
including RASA1 (also mutated in CM-AVM1). We further demonstrated that EphB4 exists in a physical
complex with RASA1, and have now solved the first multi-domain crystal structure of RASA1. Nonetheless,
most VOGM cases remain genetically unsolved, and the molecular mechanisms of VOGM-associated
mutations are poorly understood. To address these knowledge gaps, we propose a functional genomics
approach to discover and mechanistically elucidate VOGM-associated mutations with atomic-level resolution.
We hypothesize WES will identify novel VOGM genes and mutations, including mosaic and somatic
“second-hit” mutations, which disrupt the regulated activity of an EphB4-RASA1 signaling complex
essential for arterio-venous development. Based on our successful experience in identifying structural brain
disorder genes over the past several years, Aim 1 will ascertain additional VOGM case-parent trios and
perform WES on our growing cohort (already the largest in the world) to discover novel de novo and
transmitted germline VOGM gene mutations, mosaic variants, and somatic mutations in lesional tissue. In Aim
2, we will determine the structural and functional impact of VOGM mutations using biochemical, biophysical,
structural biology and cell biology techniques, with validation experiments in autopsied VOGM tissue, and in
skin biopsies of VOGM patients with associated cutaneous vascular malformations. Successful completion of
these Aims will increase our understanding of human cerebrovascular development and VOGM
pathophysiology. These advances will improve disease management and genetic counseling, and will
stimulate development of targeted therapeutics for VOGMs that may be broadly relevant for other vascular
lesions, including AVMs and intracranial aneurysms."

This K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide the candidate, Nicole R. Tuitt, DrPH,
with advanced training and structured mentoring to facilitate her transition to research independence. The
candidate's goal is to become an independent investigator with expertise in state-of-the-art approaches in the
development and evaluation of culturally relevant, strengths-based multilevel interventions which aim to reduce
substance use and sexual health disparities among urban American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) and
Black youth. The proposed scope of work will fill a gap in existing literature on multilevel approaches to reduce
substance use and sexual health inequities among youth of color. The inability of efforts to reduce adolescent
substance use and sexual health disparities to yield sustained improvements likely stem from failure to account
for mutually-reinforcing structural disadvantages and multifaceted mechanisms that include all socioecological
levels that underlie adolescent health inequities. Most risk reduction strategies focus only at the individual and
interpersonal levels. Developing and operationalizing a strengths-based conceptual framework grounded in the
socioecological model is critical to inform a multilevel intervention to reduce substance use and sexual risk-
taking among urban AIAN and Black youth. The candidate will employ a transformative, sequential mixed
methods approach to accomplish the following specific aims, each training goal is matched with the aim in
which the researcher will apply her new skills. AIM 1: Examine multilevel determinants of substance use and
sexual risk-taking among Black and AIAN high youth (ages 14-18) in Denver Metro, CO. Training: (1)
Advance expertise in theoretical and methodological foundations in social and spatial epidemiology to
understand the impact of structural contexts on risk and resilience to adolescent substance use and sexual
risk-taking; and (2) multilevel structural equation modeling, with geographic contexts, to explore the direct,
indirect, and interactive relationships across levels. AIM 2. Engage urban AIAN and Black youth to elucidate
distinct conceptual frameworks of risk and resilience to substance use and sexual risk-taking guided by
findings from Aim 1; and identify the most critical levels on which to intervene. Training: (1) Develop skills in
scenario-based qualitative interviewing (SBI) to engage youth to interpret quantitative data in the development
of conceptual frameworks of risk and resilience. The K01 award will position Dr. Tuitt as a trained researcher
with expertise on the influence of structural disadvantages on adolescent substance use and sexual risk-taking
as well as multilevel approaches. Given her shift away from a focus on individual behaviors to structural
factors, expertise in SBI, social and spatial epidemiology, and multilevel SEM will ensure the candidates
successful transition into an independent researcher and will situate her to strengthen the field of adolescent
health equity research and prevention science."

Santa Fe College (SF) and the University of Florida (UF) seek to continue the SF2UF program,
a partnership designed to increase the number of underrepresented (UR) students who transfer
from SF to UF, graduate with baccalaureate degrees, and continue to careers in biomedical and
behavioral science-related disciplines. For the purposes of the SF2UF project, UR students are
those who meet at least one of the following criteria:1) individuals from racial and ethnic groups
that are underrepresented in health-related sciences (Blacks or African Americans, Hispanics or
Latinos, American Indians or Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders), 2)
individuals with disabilities, and 3) individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds (per NIH NOT-
OD-20-031). The SF2UF program design is based on three foundational principles: 1) the first
two years of college are the most critical for recruitment and retention of students in the
sciences; 2) early and consistent participation in high-quality mentored research increases
retention and academic performance, especially among UR students; and 3) addressing mental
health and wellness with students should be an essential component of a training program for
UR undergraduate transfer students. The program has five measurable specific aims as
performance targets: 1) increase by 25% the number of freshman students at SF enrolled in the
program-associated courses who are considering a career as a research scientist, 2) recruit 29
trainees into the SF2UF program over five years, 2) achieve 100% of the trainees successfully
transferring to UF or another four-year institution, 3) retain at least 90% of the trainees for the
full three-year training period, 4) graduate at least 90% of the trainees with a B.S. degree within
four years of joining the program, and 5) achieve at least 75% of the trainees continuing to a
post-baccalaureate degree programs — including at least 60% continuing to a Ph.D. degree
program — within two years of earning the BS degree. The SF2UF program aims to achieve
these targets with novel educational programs at SF, and an integrated research mentoring and
career development experience at SF and UF designed to prepare the trainees for matriculation

BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety are the leading causes of disability and lost productivity, and are
often underdiagnosed and undertreated owing to access, cost, and stigma barriers. Novel and scalable
psychotherapies are urgently needed. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer a transformative opportunity
to develop intelligent voice assistants as virtual health agents accessible on personal devices. Meanwhile,
major advances in human neuroscience have fueled a paradigm shift to study brain mechanisms underlying
behavioral health interventions. OBJECTIVES: Leveraging our collaborative team’s transdisciplinary expertise
in these emerging areas, we will develop and rigorously test a novel voice-enabled, AI virtual agent named
Lumen, trained on Problem Solving Therapy (PST), for patients with moderate, untreated depressive and/or
anxiety symptoms. We will investigate the effect of Lumen on engagement of a priori neural targets—amygdala
for emotional reactivity and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for cognitive control—as putative
mechanisms. DESIGN/ METHODS: The project has 2 phases. In the R61 phase (years 1-2), we will further
develop Lumen building on the current prototype and conduct iterative user-centered design evaluations that
include focus groups, scenario-based clinician evaluations, and a formative user study with 20 participants. We
will pilot test Lumen in a 2-arm randomized clinical trial (RCT, Study 1), with 60 participants with depression
and/or anxiety randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive PST with Lumen (n=40) on a secure study iPad or be on a
waitlist (n=20). At weeks 0 and 14, participants will complete functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to
assess neural target engagement as well as validated surveys of patient-reported outcomes (e.g., depressive
and anxiety symptoms, functioning, quality of life). In addition, they will complete naturalistic end-of-day
assessments of mood, stress, appraisal and coping for 7 days every 2 weeks. If the Go milestone criteria are
met, the R33 phase (years 3-5) will include a 3-arm RCT (Study 2) with 200 new participants randomized in a
2:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 arms: Lumen (n=100), waitlist control (n=50), and in-person PST as active control (n=50).
Participants will complete baseline and follow-up assessments using a refined measurement protocol based on
Study 1. SPECIFIC AIMS: R61 aims are to (1) establish the functionality, usability, and treatment fidelity of
Lumen; and (2) demonstrate feasibility, acceptability, and neural target engagement according to pre-specified
Go milestone criteria. R33 aims are to (1) confirm neural target engagement by a superiority test (primary)
comparing the Lumen and waitlist control arms and a noninferiority test (secondary) comparing the Lumen and
in-person PST arms; and (2) examine the relationships of target engagement to outcomes. The results will
provide the basis for future confirmatory efficacy testing of Lumen. IMPACT: This project’s public health impact
lies in that a mechanistically tested, PST-trained AI agent could bring proven psychotherapy to people with
depression/anxiety who do not seek professional help or who desire more personalized, connected care."

The human gut microbiome is associated with a range of diseases, and may positively
or negatively affect the success of therapies. However, the causal directions between
the human gut microbiome and host health are seldomly clear due to a lack of feasible
controlled experiments in humans. High resolution, high frequency temporal data of
paired microbiome and physiological measurement, and rich metadata of potential
confounders, allow the application of causal inference frameworks. Such data can be
mined for potential microbiome drivers of host health, especially if both the microbiome
and host physiology are perturbed during the time courses. We have recently published
a vast longitudinal microbiome set from cancer patients undergoing severe perturbation
of their immune system. Concurrently, these patients experience dramatic shifts in their
gut ecosystem. We here propose to unlock this data and build a discovery platform for
microbiome causality, towards rational microbiome engineering. We will develop a new
machine-learning technique that enables rapid exploration of our data through effective
visualization and a web-based interface. We will develop a new method to identify gut
microbial competitor species of common pathogens, which are systematically missed by
existing approaches but are representing the most promising targets for microbiome
engineering. Finally, we will elucidate the bidirectional interplay between human-
targeted medications and the gut microbiome. For this, we will leverage our large data
set of paired microbiome and host immune cell trajectories. This will validate recent in
vitro results indicating that human-targeted medications may influence gut ecology
using in situ data, and it will identify potential gut microbiome modulation of
pharmacokinetics."
10904011,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing global pandemic. Despite substantial short term mortality
risk, the overwhelming majority of infected patients survive acute illness, resulting in a growing population at risk
for long term events. Cardiopulmonary symptoms are common after COVID-19, as shown by survey data
reporting fatigue (53%), dyspnea (43%), and worsened quality of life (44%) 60 days after acute infection, but
mechanism and time course of symptoms are unknown. Recent studies and our own preliminary data have
shown myocardial tissue abnormalities on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) to be common in COVID-19
survivors – raising the possibility that symptoms stem from viral effects on the heart. However, CMR findings to
date are limited by small size and clinical data susceptible to referral bias, raising uncertainty as to
generalizability. It is also unknown whether altered myocardial tissue properties (fibrosis, edema) impact clinical
outcomes.
The central hypothesis of our research is that CMR tissue characterization will be incremental to clinical
assessment and cardiac contractile function for prediction of long-term cardiopulmonary symptoms, effort
tolerance, and prognosis among COVID-19 survivors. To test this, we will study patients from an active multi-
ethnic NYC registry of COVID-19 survivors: We have already leveraged echocardiographic imaging data from
this registry to show that (1) adverse cardiac remodeling (dilation, dysfunction) markedly augments short term
mortality, (2) COVID-19 acutely alters left and right ventricular remodeling, and (3) many patients who survive
initial hospitalization for COVID-19 have adverse cardiac remodeling – including 40% with left ventricular (LV)
dysfunction and 32% with adverse RV remodeling (dilation, dysfunction): Our current proposal will extend
logically on our preliminary data to test whether CMR tissue characterization provides incremental predictive
utility with respect to reverse remodeling and prognosis. At least 510 COVID-19 survivors will be studied. Echo
will be analyzed at time of and following COVID-19 for longitudinal remodeling, as will CMR at pre-specified (6-
12, 36 month) follow-up timepoints. Established and novel CMR technologies will be employed, including
assessment of cardiac and lung injury, high resolution (3D) myocardial tissue characterization, and
cardiopulmonary blood oxygenation. In parallel, QOL, effort tolerance (6-minute walk test), biomarkers, and
rigorous follow-up will be obtained to discern clinical implications and relative utility of imaging findings. Aim 1
will identify determinants of impaired quality of life and effort intolerance among COVID-19 survivors. Aim 2 will
test whether myocardial tissue injury on CMR is associated with impaired contractility, and whether fibrosis
predicts contractile recovery. Aim 3 will determine whether myocardial tissue injury is independently associated
with adverse prognosis (new onset clinical heart failure, hospitalization, mortality). Results will address key
knowledge gaps regarding COVID-19 effects on the heart necessary to guide surveillance, risk stratification, and
targeted therapies for millions of COVID-19 survivors at risk for myocardial injury, cardiopulmonary symptoms,
and adverse prognosis."

 Dr. Bruegl is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Oregon Health and
Science University and a national Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Harold Amos Minority Faculty
Development Fellow. Her long-term career goal is to eliminate the disparities in cervical cancer incidence and
mortality in the American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) population; a goal that aligns with the mission and
vision of the National Cancer Institute.
 AI/AN women are 1.5 times more likely to be diagnosed with cervical cancer and 2X as likely to die of the
disease compared to Non-Hispanic White women. Multiple risk factors contribute to the development of
cervical cancer including not accessing pap smear screening, smoking, socioeconomic status, and acquisition
of high-risk subtypes of the human papillomavirus (hrHPV). This proposal seeks to look deeper in to these
persistent health disparities by critically evaluating the utilization and applicability of cervical cancer prevention
tools such as HPV vaccination, pap smear screening, and distribution of high-risk HPV (hrHPV) types in the
AI/AN population. HPV vaccination is a primary prevention tool to prevent cervical cancer and its precursor
lesions with U.S. recommendations to vaccination youth ages 11-12. There are 14 types of high-risk HPV
(hrHPV) associated with cancer and types 16 and 18 contribute to ~70% of cancer cases. One of the proposed
study goals is to fully evaluate the HPV vaccination rates and trends and pap smear rates among Oregon
AI/AN. This data will to identify communities with high and low vaccination rates and focus groups of
healthcare providers and community members will occur to identify barriers and facilitators of HPV vaccination.
 There are few studies evaluating the prevalence of hrHPV subtypes in AI/AN women and data suggest that
the distribution of the 14 types differ from the general U.S. population, which can lead to real clinical
consequences. First, vaccination may provide inadequate coverage for prevalent subtypes. Second,
colposcopy, an office-based procedure to more fully evaluate the cervix, is less sensitive at detecting dysplasia
due to non hrHPV 16 and 18 subtypes. A greater prevalence of other hrHPV subtypes in the AI/AN population
can lead to missed, early-stage disease. A cross-sectional study will be performed to determine the prevalence
and distribution of hrHPV among AI/AN women.

Xenotransplantation (XTx) is a novel experimental treatment that involves transplanting organs from nonhuman
animals into humans. Due to the scarcity of human organs for transplantation, XTx could help alleviate the
organ shortage, which is an ongoing public health problem. Early experimental xenotransplants were
performed in the U.S. from the 1960s to 1990s, involving a chimpanzee kidney, a baboon heart, and a baboon
liver. Despite holding great promise, XTx experiments ended in the late 1990s due to scientific and ethical
challenges. Today, XTx is undergoing a renaissance. Scientific advances in immunosuppression and genome
editing techniques have mitigated the risk of zoonotic disease transmission. The transplant field is primed to
conduct XTx clinical trials and then translate findings to clinical care. However, available guidelines for
conducting XTx clinical trials are outdated, do not address advances in the science of XTx, do not account for
stakeholders’ concerns, and do not consider the impact on policy changes to organ allocation. The overall
objective of the proposed study is to identify appropriate ethical and policy guidance for translational
solid organ XTx clinical trials. The research team includes national bioethics leaders at The Hastings
Center, Northwestern University, and Rutgers University, with The Hastings Center serving as the data
coordinating center. We will conduct in-depth interviews with transplant patients, transplant clinicians,
transplant regulators, and human subjects ethics regulators, and obtain input from an Ethics and Policy
Advisory Committee comprised of experts in translational science and bioethics to: (1) assess XTx
stakeholders’ perceptions and concerns about ethical and policy challenges for XTx clinical trials; (2) develop
XTx stakeholder decision aids that help patients, clinicians, and institutional review boards to evaluate, design,
and oversee XTx clinical trials, respectively; and (3) develop recommendations for the ethical translation of
XTx clinical trials. Updated guidance and decision aids will facilitate ethical decision-making about XTx clinical
trials. The innovative and timely decision aids will contain generalizable ethical principles for human subjects
research protections and policy considerations regarding organ allocation that will apply to XTx clinical trials
involving other organs. Future next steps include designing a study to test the influence of the decision aids on
the choices of patients, IRBs, and transplant centers about XTx kidney clinical trials."

In this renewal, we seek to understand the origin of heterogeneity in sickle cell disease (SCD), which is present
at every scale from molecules to the clinic, and is the major impediment to clinical management and the
development of new therapies. Moreover, therapy often increases heterogeneity, with some patients responding
strongly to therapy and others unresponsive. Our central hypothesis is that heterogeneity originates with
intracellular kinetics of sickle hemoglobin (HbS) self-assembly that translates into heterogeneous populations of
RBCs, which drive strong non-Newtonian fluid behavior in whole blood and alterations in the systemic circulation
that precipitate pathologies such as endothelial injury, vaso-occlusion, aneurysm, and stroke. Thus, the ability to
guide therapeutic intervention and to develop new therapies is ultimately hindered by our limited understanding
of heterogeneity in the context of multiscale biophysical processes in SCD pathophysiology. In this work, we will
develop a biophysical framework for SCD pathophysiology that spans from molecules to the systemic circulation,
that is experimentally validated at every scale, and that allows us to predict the effects of multiscale
heterogeneity. Specifically, we will: (1) Develop a quantitative framework for HbS polymerization that
accurately predicts the kinetics of self-assembly; (2) Define the connection between the distribution of
HbS polymer and mechanical properties among a population of RBCs; (3) Understand how cellular
heterogeneity drives non-Newtonian blood rheology and altered flow in the systemic circulation. The
work in this renewal builds on key conceptual advances made during our last 3 years of funding: HbS self-
assembly kinetics have previously been underestimated by at least an order of magnitude; HbS polymer is
heterogeneously distributed in RBCs at finite oxygen tension; velocity profiles in sickle blood demonstrate strong
non-Newtonian effects; blood flow in SCD patients is altered throughout the circulation with aberrantly large wall
shear stress relative to healthy blood. This work also leverages a unique and enabling set of tools that we have
developed during the last 3 years of funding: the highest spatiotemporal resolution measurements of single HbS
fiber assembly to-date; the first platform capable of quantifying HbS polymer in large populations of single RBCs
under well-defined oxygen tension; a platform capable of quantifying viscoelastic properties of large populations
of RBCs under well-defined oxygen tension; the ability to quantify submicron velocity fields in flowing blood at
physiologic hematocrit; a platform to quantify sickle blood flow within physiologic oxygen gradients. Building on
these tools and insights, this renewal work will develop and validate a multiscale model describing how
heterogeneity propagates from the molecular to cellular to system levels, and we will develop experimental tools
that can be used for clinical management and therapeutic development."

Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) affects ~1/10,000 people and is caused by decreased
epigenetic repression of the DUX4 retrogene with subsequent mis-expression of DUX4 in skeletal
muscle. As increasing the SMCHD1-mediated epigenetic repression at the D4Z4 locus silences DUX4
in FSHD1 and FSHD2 muscle cells, this application will take a direct molecular biology approach to
identify the diversity of SMCHD1 complexes and the role of each component in establishing and
maintaining repressive chromatin structure at the D4Z4 and preventing DUX4 expression in skeletal
muscle. The broad and long-term goal is to determine the functional components of the SMCHD1
complexes at the D4Z4 locus as a basis for future therapies directed at increasing epigenetic
repression. The major hypothesis is that SMCHD1 forms different interactions depending on post-
translational modification, chromatin association, and developmental state of the cell, and that
understanding the functional roles of the different complexes will provide simple reductionist models for
testing candidate interventions. Aim 1 will determine the proteins complexed with SMCHD1 at the
D4Z4 locus and their functional significance, chromatin association, and SUMO dependence. Aim 2 will
determine the composition of SMCHD1 complexes at autosomal single copy loci in the genome
compared to repetitive regions and to subdomains of the D4Z4. Aim 3 will identify the relative roles of
SMCHD1 complex components in the establishment and maintenance of epigenetic modifications
during stem cell reprogramming and differentiation. Together, these aims will add clarity to the
components of SMCHD1 complexes and their functional roles in D4Z4 epigenetic repression, and
provide new opportunities to design interventions to suppress DUX4 expression as a treatment for
FSHD."
10934583,"The goal of the project is to develop a new mathematical and computational
modeling framework for from biomedical data extracted from biomedical
experiments such as voltages, spectra (e.g. mass, magnetic resonance,
impedance, optical absorption, …), microscopy or radiology images, gene
expression, and many others. Scientists who are looking to understand
relationships between different molecular and cellular measurements are often
faced with questions involving deciphering differences between different cell or
organ measurements. Current approaches (e.g. feature engineering and
classification, end-to-end neural networks) are often viewed as “black boxes,”
given their lack of connection to any biological mechanistic effects. The approach
we propose builds from the “ground up” an entirely new modeling framework
build based on recently developed invertible transformation. As such, it allows for
any machine learning model to be represented in original data space, allowing for
not only increased accuracy in prediction, but also direct visualization and
interpretation. As an outcome of the previous funding period, our current
approach outperforms other mathematical modeling tools when processing
segmented signals and images by a wide margin in terms of accuracy,
computational complexity, amount of training data needed, interpretability and
robustness to out of distribution samples. In this current phase we seek to
generalize the method beyond segmented images and signals to virtually any
dataset type. We will explore proof of concept applications in cytometry,
pathology, and radiomics."

Mindfulness-based smartphone apps have surged in popularity in recent years. Headspace – among the most
popular of these platforms – has over 42 million users. Recent surveys indicate that 11% of U.S. adolescents
have used mindfulness apps as a means of coping with anxiety or depressive symptoms, which increase
substantially during the adolescent years. A growing body of research implicates rumination as being a
transdiagnostic risk factor involved in the development of depression and anxiety in youth. Critically,
mindfulness meditation has shown significant promise in targeting rumination, and ultimately improving
depressive and anxiety symptoms. Mindfulness apps offer a convenient and cost-effective means for
accessing mindfulness training, while being interactive and engaging for youth. Despite their growing popularity
among teens, strikingly little research has been conducted on these apps. Two critical questions have yet to be
addressed, which are strongly aligned with the NCCIH Strategic Plan: (1) what are the underlying neural and
cognitive mechanisms that account for the beneficial effects of these apps and (2) for whom is app-based
mindfulness well-suited. To address these gaps, adolescents (ages 13-18) will be randomly assigned to an
app-delivered mindfulness course vs. an active control condition and will complete pre- and post-intervention
resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans to probe static and dynamic functional
connectivity within – and between – brain networks strongly implicated in mindfulness training and rumination
(i.e., Default Mode Network and Salience Network). In addition, cognitive tasks will be administered at pre- and
post-intervention to assess attentional control abilities putatively enhanced by mindfulness training. Finally,
mindfulness skills and changes in rumination will be assessed via a smartphone-based ecological momentary
assessment (EMA) protocol developed in the PI’s lab. First, we will test whether changes in (1) brain functional
connectivity, (2) attentional control and (3) acquisition and use of mindfulness skills mediate between-group
(i.e., app vs. control) differences in the reduction of rumination. Second, we will test whether a machine
learning model incorporating baseline clinical, demographic, and psychosocial characteristics can be used to
identify which adolescents are predicted to benefit from app-based mindfulness training. Recent advances in
machine learning allow for the development of algorithms predicting outcome at the individual level, as well as
the integration of numerous predictors rather than relying on single variables that may, in isolation, have limited
clinically-useful predictive value. Ultimately, such an algorithm may inform individual risk-benefit assessments
that could be used to objectively communicate the probability of experiencing positive vs. adverse outcomes to
users prior to engaging with a mindfulness app. Collectively, results are expected to advance (1) our
understanding of the underlying mechanisms that account for the beneficial effects of app-based mindfulness
training and (2) our ability to predict which adolescents are well-suited to these increasingly popular apps."
10843951,"Allergic diseases are caused by skewed immune responses to otherwise harmless antigens, and, in
one form or another, affect up to 25% of the population in the United States, with a disproportionately
increase especially among children with asthma and food-related hypersensitivities. The binding of specific
IgE to cells bearing high affinity receptors (FcεRI) is hallmark for the pathogenesis of allergic disease in that
subsequent interaction with allergen causes cells such as basophils, mast cells, and dendritic cells to
release pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines that promote and/or amplify disease. In particular,
crosslinking of IgE/FcεRI triggers basophils to release histamine and LTC4 but also IL-4 and IL-13 –
mediators and cytokines central to the allergic diathesis. More recently, these activities have been
confirmed and extended in vivo using mouse models, with some showing evidence for an “axis” whereby
epithelial cell (EC)-derived cytokines activate basophils to produce IL-4 (& IL-13). In contrast, confirmatory
results of these EC cytokines activating human basophils have not been forthcoming. In exploring this
translational discrepancy, we serendipitously uncovered a remarkably robust, and potentially unique, mode
of EC-dependent activation of human basophils that requires cell-to-cell adhesion and is IgE-dependent.
Preliminary data now point to this mode of activation (discovered after co-culturing basophils with A549-lung
EC) as being mediated by galectin-3 (Gal-3) –a lectin long known to bind IgE. There is also rationale for yet
another level of regulation to this response –one mediated by Gal-9, which also binds IgE with nearly 100-
fold greater affinity than does Gal-3 but lacks IgE/FcεRI crosslinking capabilities. Aim 1 studies further
characterize the parameters underlying EC-dependent activation of basophils, with the goal of extending
Gal-3-dependent activation to include primary human epithelial cells (PHEC). The Gal-3/Gal-9 interplay is
also to be addressed in PHEC using genetic manipulation as well as a model whereby microspheres are
coated with these galectins. Signaling pathways will also be explored and are thought to differ from those
associated with standard anaphylactic release. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that Gal-3/9 interplay also
regulates the activities of other IgE-bearing cells, with preliminary evidence that Gal-3 also induces DC
subtypes to secrete large quantities of pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e. TNF-α/IL-6). Finally, Aim-3
investigates the regulation of Gal3/9 on EC, hypothesizing that their expression is counter-regulated by pro-
inflammatory cytokines/mediators vs. innate immune stimuli. Overall, these results could ultimately provide
insight into several unexplained IgE-related phenomena for which these IgE-bearing cells and Gal-3 are all
implicated, ranging from allergic disease (e.g. asthma, chronic urticaria, and atopic dermatitis) to non-
allergic conditions, including autoimmunity (lupus nephritis), cancer, and conceivably wound healing."

Recent therapeutic advances considerably reduced the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The
contribution of low-density (LDL) and very low density (VLDL) lipoproteins is critical in atherogenesis.
Regardless the progress of clinical treatments in the past 30 years, for a significant proportion of statin-treated
patients, with or without combination therapy, insufficient LDL-C reduction and relatively high residual risk still
remain, likely associated with persistent relatively high triglyceride (TG) levels, thus limiting the benefits of
these therapies. This underscores the need for additional new therapies targeting lipid metabolism in CVD
prevention and treatment. In this proposal, we propose to develop genetic deficiency of ApoC3 through an
adeno-associated virus (AAV) mediated in vivo silencing of ApoC3 by Cas9 base editor (Cas9-BE) strategy
(AAV-Cas9-BE-ApoC3) to render protection against high cholesterol diet-induced hypercholesterolemia and
atherosclerosis in rabbits. Specifically, we will 1) develop AAV-Cas9-BE-ApoC3 in a preclinical model species,
the New Zealand White rabbits. We will determine the optimal targeting strategies using in vitro cultured rabbit
cells, followed by experiments to determine the optimal delivery parameters to achieve effective ApoC3 gene
knockout in rabbit hepatocytes; 2) evaluate the efficacy of AAV-Cas9-BE-ApoC3 using optimal conditions
determined in Aim 1 to knockout ApoC3 in rabbits; 3) conduct multiple-year evaluation of the safety of AAV-
Cas9-BE-ApoC3 in rabbits. Completion of these aims by leveraging new CRISPR/Cas9 technology to target
ApoC3 will provide compelling evidence to establish ApoC3 as a novel feasible target for gene editing-based
therapy for hyperlipidemia and CVD."

 Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) is a poliomyelitis-like illness of children that emerged in the US in 2014.
Since then, AFM outbreaks occur August-October every other year, concurrent with outbreaks of enterovirus
D68 (EV-D68) infection. Increasing evidence now indicates that EV-D68 is a principal cause of AFM. EV-D68,
in the same Enterovirus genus as poliovirus, primarily causes respiratory tract infections. However, the
mechanisms of EV-D68 neuropathogenesis and the characteristics of the human immune response to EV-D68
are poorly understood. This five-year research career development award will provide training and
development of the skills necessary for the PI to establish an independent research program focused on
understanding how EV-D68 causes respiratory and neurologic disease and how human antibodies modify this
pathogenesis. Currently the PI is an Assistant Professor on the tenure track in Pediatric Infectious Diseases
and Microbiology & Immunology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine. His
training to date has focused on the isolation and characterization of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from
subjects with prior EV-D68 infection. He will supplement this experience with further training in developing in
vivo mouse and ex vivo human tissue models of EV-D68 infection with which to study the pathogenesis of this
virus and how human antibodies, both monoclonal and polyclonal, modify pathogenesis. The short-term goal of
the proposed studies is to test the central hypothesis that human antibodies prevent EV-D68 from causing
AFM but do not protect against respiratory disease. The PI will be mentored by national experts in the study of
picornaviruses (Drs. Craig Cameron and Stanley Lemon), human airway epithelial cultures (Dr. Raymond
Pickles), mouse models of virus infection (Dr. Mark Heise), and human antibodies (Dr. James Crowe, Jr.). The
specific aims are to 1) determine how EV-D68-specific human antibodies modify virus-induced respiratory
disease and AFM in a mouse model of infection, to test the hypothesis that antibodies efficiently preclude EV-
D68 from causing AFM by preventing dissemination to the CNS; and 2) investigate factors that determine the
efficacy of antibody at inhibiting EV-D68 infection in differentiated primary human airway epithelial cells at an
air-liquid interface, to test the hypothesis that antibodies poorly protect against initial respiratory mucosal
infection. Overall, these studies will help determine whether EV-D68 neutralizing antibodies are a mechanistic
correlate of protection from AFM by pinpointing the quantity and quality of antibodies capable of restricting EV-
D68 infection to the respiratory tract. Industry collaborators are developing protective mAbs made by the PI as
human therapeutic agents, which would be the only available targeted therapy for children with EV-D68
infection. Thus, these studies directly translate to importance in human health in addition to contributing to a
more fundamental understanding of disease."
10809021,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth leading cause of cancer-related mortality, with
most deaths attributable to metastasis and treatment failure. Unfortunately, our understanding of the pathways
that underlie invasion and metastasis is incomplete, but some hints were uncovered by our recent single cell
sequencing analyses which revealed that many HNSCC tumors contained cells that were neither fully epithelial
nor fully mesenchymal, but were in a unique, hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal (hybrid-EM) state. The presence
of hybrid-EM cells was more predictive of poor response than smoking history, and functional studies established
hybrid-EM as a key driver of invasion and metastasis. Together, these observations establish hybrid-EM as a
central pathway in HNSCC progression. However, hybrid-EM marker proteins are not druggable, so it remains
challenging to therapeutically target this state. Cell states like hybrid-EM are regulated by a variety of
mechanisms, but super-enhancers, in particular, have been identified as essential for maintaining cell identity.
We therefore targeted super-enhancers in HNSCC using the BET inhibitor JQ1 and observed a reduction in
HNSCC invasion of ~2-fold and a suppression of hybrid-EM. This result was encouraging, but effect size was
modest due to the indirect and non-specific mode of action of JQ1. We hypothesized that if we could elucidate
genes regulated by super-enhancers in HNSCC, we could identify molecular pathways that are more directly
and specifically involved with invasion and metastasis and uncover more potent targets. Our initial experiments
found that super-enhancers regulate cholesterol biosynthesis genes in hybrid-EM cells and that their knockdown
(KD) robustly disrupts hybrid-EM phenotypes, with a >2000-fold and >8000-fold reduction in invasion upon KD
of two mevalonate synthesis genes. Importantly, the protein products of many of the cholesterol genes we
identified can be inhibited by commercially available small molecules. Indeed, we found that statins, which inhibit
cholesterol biosynthesis, potently inhibit invasion (>10-fold reduction). These data provide strong support for our
original hypothesis. We now propose to use CRISPRi to systematically investigate the role of cholesterol
metabolism in invasion in HNSCC using sophisticated in vitro and in vivo models (Aim 1). In Aim 2, we will
evaluate 9 small molecule inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis in cell lines, patient-derived organoids (PDOs),
and in vivo pre-clinical models. Finally, in Aim 3, we will identify the full regulatory network of super-enhancers
that control hybrid-EM, specifically focusing on Brd2-4 which are inhibited by JQ1. For these experiments, we
will use single cell approaches to account for tumor heterogeneity and thereby uncover additional pathways
beyond cholesterol biosynthesis that direct invasion and metastasis. Together, these experiments will provide
critical insights into how super-enhancers regulate hybrid-EM, while exploring the possibility that by targeting the
super-enhancer-regulated cholesterol biosynthesis pathway using existing FDA-approved drugs, we could
circumvent a length drug development process and move quickly into human trials."

Bioinformatics Resources Core (BiRC) will reinforce the original goal to strengthen the biomedical research
capacity in Puerto Rico by serving as a platform to offer hands-on support for conducting multidisciplinary
research with bioinformatics. BiRC will directly contribute to strengthening the scientific environment by
supporting competitive research projects with bioinformatics components, through technical core services, and
education and training support from a multidisciplinary team of experts. Improved oversight and mentoring in
the implementation of bioinformatics approaches in research projects, as well as close training and educational
activities for faculty, students and postdoctoral associates will be a hallmark of this renewed BiRC program. A
multidisciplinary team of experts will be working together to provide support to research projects in the
implementation of bioinformatics approaches and data analyses including areas of metagenomics,
metatranscriptomics, mathematical modeling, research design, and power analyses, thus providing the
expertise to efficiently and cost effectively conduct next generation research in a collaborative environment.
 The primary objective is to train faculty, students and postdoctoral associates who can apply bioinformatics
skills in their research projects, develop new collaborative partnerships between PUI and lead investigators
with BiRC researchers, and improve science education by integrating computational experiences in traditional
biology courses through new Statistics, and the Research and Education (R&E) Sub-cores. We expect to
sustain a vigorous biomedical training pipeline in bioinformatics that contributes to increase bioinformatics and

10889091,"Project Abstract – Bupropion for the Prevention of Postpartum Smoking Relapse
Postpartum smoking relapse rates have remained stagnant for over a decade with approximately 50% of those
who are able to achieve smoking abstinence during pregnancy relapsing within the first few months after
childbirth. Maternal cigarette smoking results in a significant increase in a variety of negative health
consequences for both mother and child. Of women who smoke three months prior to pregnancy, 55% quit
during their pregnancy. The following postpartum period presents a unique and challenging time for women to
maintain smoking abstinence. Several modifiable risk factors are predictive of postpartum smoking relapse
including depression, weight concerns, and smoking related symptomatology. Bupropion is uniquely suited to
address each of these relapse related risk factors in postpartum women. Treatments that address these multi-
faceted barriers related to postpartum smoking relapse may lead to sustained abstinence. Bupropion has
proven efficacy for smoking cessation in the general population, doubling quit rates at six months. Though less
explored in the literature, bupropion treatment for smoking relapse prevention has demonstrated a delay to
relapse in those receiving bupropion. Yet the use of bupropion for postpartum smoking relapse prevention has
not been explored. Therefore, our central hypothesis is that bupropion will prevent postpartum smoking relapse
among women who quit smoking during pregnancy. To explore this hypothesis, we will conduct a two-arm,
double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial using rigorous, validated and reproducible methods
that will be implemented by a team of experienced investigators who are familiar with this population. We will
enroll pregnant women (n=230) who quit smoking after learning they were pregnant and are motivated to stay
abstinent postpartum. Participants will be randomized to receive extended release bupropion (active 300mg or
placebo once daily beginning 4 to 10 days postpartum to 12 weeks post randomization). All participants will
complete the same data collection procedures (e.g., biological sample collection for hormone and cotinine
analysis and completion of validated questionnaires) at baseline (gestational week 36), weekly from 4 to 10
days postpartum through 12 weeks post randomization and at weeks 12, 24, 36 and 52 post randomization.
Intervention adherence will be confirmed quantitatively via high performance liquid chromatography using
biological samples. The implications of this novel study, pursued by a highly skilled and productive team, will
directly advance the current state of the science by expanding on the role of a known pharmacotherapy within
this highly vulnerable population. Further, should our central hypothesis be supported, the dissemination of this
intervention is clinically applicable, relevant and may be immediately pursued."
10666353,"In 2017 the International Diabetes Federation estimated that the worldwide prevalence of diabetes would
increase from 415 million in 2015 to 642 million in 2040. Approximately 40% of individuals with diabetes
develop diabetic nephropathy (DN). Twenty percent of these individuals do not follow the typical path toward
chronic kidney disease, which is a slow multi-decade increase in albuminuria and serum creatinine, the current
standard-of-care for surveillance of chronic kidney disease (KD). Consequently, there is an unmet clinical need
for routine surveillance during the first decade of chronic KD.
 We propose external imaging of mesangial cell function as a biomarker for diabetic nephropathy. Our
reasoning is based on the following. Mesangial cell matrix (MCM) expansion is a histologic hallmark of diabetic
nephropathy, which precedes the reduction of a patient’s glomerular filtration rate or increase in albuminuria.
Additionally, all the clinical manifestations of diabetic nephropathy are highly correlated with MCM expansion.
 There currently does not exist an imaging, serum, or urine biomarker that is sensitive to mesangial cell
function. Current imaging agents and biomarkers are only sensitive to glomerular filtration, effective renal
plasma flow, or albuminuria, which are altered late in the disease when therapeutic intervention is not effective.
 We propose a Phase 1 clinical trial of Tc-99m-tilmanocept, which accumulates in the liver and kidneys. The
molecular mechanism is binding to CD206, which resides on the cell surface of fixed macrophages within the
liver and mesangial cells within the kidney. We present preliminary data consisting of human SPECT/CT and
rat microPET images of renal cortex. Additionally, we present evidence of sensitivity to MCM expansion via Tc-
99m-tilmanocept dynamic imaging of db/db mice, an accepted disease model of diabetic nephropathy.
 We propose an open-label study to investigate the biodistribution at two dose levels (2.0 & 20 nmol) of Tc-
99m-tilmanocept. We will study 5 groups at each dose (10 subjects each): 1) Advance DN, 2) early DN, 3)
diabetes with no kidney disease, 4) advanced hypertension (HTN) with KD, and 5) HTN without KD. The study
will include a 30-min dynamic followed be a 30-min kidney SPECT/CT, and periodic blood and urine sampling.
Dynamic imaging will yield plasma clearance half-lifes, and liver and kidney accumulation rates; SPECT/CT will
yield SUVs for the heart, liver, renal cortex, renal medulla. We will also calculate urinary bladder accumulation.
 We expect the renograms and biodistribution data to reflect the following pathology: Group 1, severe MCM
expansion; G2, mild MCM expansion; G3 & G5, no MCM expansion; and G4, low MCM expansion.
 This study is the necessary first step toward FDA-approval of Tc-99m-tilmancoept as a kidney imaging
agent. The study will also provide evidence of imaging sensitivity to MCM expansion in DN patients, and
insensitivity to patients with HTN. This senerio will be required if Tc-99m-tilmanocept renograms as “first-line”
diagnostic test for diabetic patients."

The Pediatric Hospital Epidemiology and Outcomes research Training (PHEOT) Program at Children’s
Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) is a 2-year postdoctoral research fellowship designed to provide physicians
with training in hospital epidemiology and outcomes research. The PHEOT program trains the next generation
of physician scientists to best measure, investigate, and improve outcomes and patient safety for hospitalized
children. Through a combination of formal coursework and mentored research projects, physician trainees
develop expertise in comparative effectiveness research, exposure and outcomes measurement, severity
adjustment, and decision analysis as they relate to pediatric hospital care. Five post-doctoral trainees
simultaneously participate in the PHEOT program across the 2 years of training. Trainees benefit from the
combined resources of two Centers at the CHOP Research Institute: The Center for Outcomes Research and
the Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, as well as a rich array of “natural laboratories” for evaluating and
improving health care processes and outcomes, including the Pediatric Advanced Care Service, the General
Pediatrics Inpatient Service, the Center for Simulation, Advanced Education and Innovation, and the Center for
Quality, Safety, and Analytics. All fellows complete Masters-level coursework in study design and biostatistics
culminating in either the Master of Science in Clinical Epidemiology (MSCE) or the Master of Science in Health
Policy Research (MSHP) degree at the University of Pennsylvania. Each fellow is assigned a mentorship team
consisting of seasoned methodology, content, and biostatistics mentors who supervise the trainee in the
successful completion and publication of at least one research project. PHEOT fellows also benefit from a host
of professional development activities, including works-in-progress sessions, a weekly seminar series to teach
academic medicine skills, and opportunities to present research at national meetings."

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) provides predictive information for risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) events
beyond that gained from traditional cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Hispanics/Latinos have lower
prevalence of CAC than whites, even after accounting for differences in CVD risk factors. They also have lower
rates of CVD mortality and longer life expectancies despite higher rates of risk factors and adverse
socioeconomic conditions (the ‘Hispanic Paradox’), lending credence to the existence of Hispanic/Latino-specific
CVD protective mechanisms. Little data currently exist on the presence/absence and extent of CAC and CT-
derived plaque volume, density, and distribution in diverse Hispanics/Latinos, and their associations with
sociocultural characteristics and lifestyle factors that have been associated with CVD in the Hispanic Community
Health Study/ Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) and other cohorts. Another critical knowledge gap is whether
epigenetic mechanisms, i.e., DNA methylation, alone or in conjunction with genetic factors, act as an important
biological link between such risk or protective factors and subclinical/clinical CVD in Hispanics/Latinos. The
proposed study aims to generate critical data on subclinical coronary atherosclerosis (CAC and CT-derived
plaque volume, density, and distribution) for Hispanic/Latino adults from all major heritage groups in the US
(Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Dominican, and Central/South American) and examine relationships with
sociocultural factors, lifestyle factors, traditional CVD risk factors, and epigenomic patterns. This study will be
conducted ancillary to the ongoing HCHS/SOL, which examined 16,415 Hispanic/Latino men and women ages
18-74 years at Visit 1 (2008-2011) from 4 US communities (San Diego, CA; Chicago, IL; Bronx, NY; and Miami,
FL) and 11,623 participants (81.4% follow-up rate) at Visit 2 (2014-2017). The proposed study will capitalize on
available HCHS/SOL data and will assess CAC absence/presence and features in conjunction with ongoing
HCHS/SOL Visit 3 (2020-2023) in 4,109 participants ages >45 years (mean age 60.5 years, an optimal time
window for CAC detection) and free of known history of CVD. Longitudinal examination of epigenetic biomarkers
will be conducted using stored blood DNA samples from HCHS/SOL Visits 1 and 2 for a subset of participants
(50% of participants who undergo scanning, n=2,054). The proposed study will address critical knowledge gaps
in a highly cost-effective manner by capitalizing on the established HCHS/SOL infrastructure. Examination of
these factors in this heterogeneous, well-characterized cohort, has the potential to generate novel and insightful
epidemiological, etiologic, and mechanistic information beyond that gained from previous studies, which can
help to identify novel preventive targets and inform development of precision prevention/treatment strategies that
may benefit all racial/ethnic groups."
10850594,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) are known to be immunogenically “cold” tumors. To convert
PDACs into immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) responsive tumors, effective immunotherapy strategies are
required at a minimum to: 1) increase antigenicity; 2) enhance effector T cell function, and 3) overcome
immunosuppressive signals in the tumor microenvironment(TME). Previously, we demonstrated that the
pancreatic cancer GVAX can inflame PDAC tumors with the formation of intratumoral tertiary lymphoid
aggregates. Immune checkpoint signals such as PD-L1/PD-1 were induced and potentially primed PDAC for ICI
treatments. The concept was subsequently tested in our neoadjuvant clinical trial study in resectable PDACs
and supported by the previous R01 award. The addition of anti-PD-1 antibody(aPD1) to GVAX counteracts a T
cell exhaustion phenotype, however, did not enhance the effector T cell (Teff) “quality” as indicated by lack of
enhanced Granzyme B+ CD8+ T cells. Nevertheless, we noticed that a subset of PDACs that have a higher level
of CD137 expression do have a higher density of granzyme B+ CD8+ T cells following treatment with GVAX and
aPD1. Second, IL8 expression in CD11b+ myeloid cells positively correlates with tumor-associated neutrophil
(TAN) and higher density of TANs is associated with shorter survival following the neoadjuvant therapy with
GVAX and aPD1. These results support testing the hypothesis that anti-CD137 agonist antibody(aCD137) and/or
anti-IL8 antibody(aIL8) enhances the Teff function and overcomes the immunosuppressive TME in PDACs.
Thus, this project will test the hypothesis that increased “quantity” and higher “quality” Teffs are induced, re-
invigorated, and activated in PDACs by the triple combination of vaccine, aPD1 antagonist, and aCD137 agonist.
To this end, a third arm with this triple combo has been added to the previous R01-funded neoadjuvant clinical
trial platform of resectable PDACs. Using a mouse model of PDAC, we will further test the hypothesis that
aCD137 agonist expands and enhances the function of neoepitope specific T cells. Next, this project will test
the hypothesis that inhibiting the trafficking of TANs will overcome the barriers to high “quantity” and high “quality”
Teffs trafficking and function in PDACs. To this end, two new arms will be added to the neoadjuvant platform
clinical trial to test the combination of aIL8 and nivolumab with and without GVAX, respectively. Specially, we
will test the hypothesis that significantly greater infiltration of CD137+PD-1+ T cells and enhanced expansion of
CD8+ T cell clones that express granzyme B are induced by the combination of nivolumab and aIL8. The findings
from this study will directly inform the rational design of an immunotherapy combination to be tested in a large
randomized clinical trial in locally advanced and metastatic PDAC patients."
10887460,"The aim of this grant is to elucidate the role of mitochondrial dynamics protein Drp1 as a novel redox sensor
that transmits VEGF-derived H2O2 signaling to enhance angiogenesis via regulation of endothelial cell
(EC) glycolysis. The induction of new blood vessels is critical for tissue repair in response to injury such as
peripheral arterial disease (PAD), which is impaired in diabetes. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as H2O2
derived from NADPH oxidase (NOX) and mitochondria at normal level act as signaling molecules to promote
VEGF-induced angiogenesis in endothelial cells (ECs) and reparative neovascularization. However, it remains
unclear “how diffusible H2O2 signal can be specifically transmitted to promote therapeutic angiogenesis”.
Signaling function of ROS is mainly through oxidation of reactive Cys residues to generate “Cysteine sulfenic
acid (Cys-OH)” (sulfenylation) which is involved in disulfide bond formation with target protein and redox
signaling. In addition, ECs utilize glycolysis as a major source of ATP to promote angiogenesis. However, the
mechanistic link between NOX-mitochondrial ROS (mitoROS)/redox signaling and EC metabolism (glycolysis)
in VEGF-induced angiogenesis is entirely unknown. Drp1 GTPase is key regulator of mitochondrial (mito) fission
via its post translational modification, but its role in ROS dependent VEGFR2 signaling and angiogenesis in ECs
and in vivo has never been reported. Our preliminary data are consistent with the hypothesis that VEGF
induces sulfenylation of Drp1 via NOX-derived H2O2, which drives mito fission-mitoROS axis that
promotes oxidative activation of key metabolic enzyme AMPK via disulfide bond formation (early phase)
as well as PFKFB3 expression (late phase) in ECs. This in turn enhances endothelial glycolysis and
angiogenesis required for restoring neovascularization in ischemic vascular disease. Aim1 will
characterize the VEGF-induced Drp1 sulfenylation and establish its role in ROS-dependent angiogenic
responses in ECs. Aim2 will determine the molecular mechanism by which VEGF-induced Drp1 sulfenylation
promotes glycolysis via mitochondrial ROS-dependent manner in ECs. Aim 3 will determine the functional role
of endothelial Drp1 in ROS-dependent reparative neovascularization and address underlying mechanisms in
vivo using animal model of PAD (hindlimb ischemia model). We will also address how diabetes -induced excess
ROS impair angiogenesis in ECs and in vivo by focusing on Drp1 phosphorylation at S616, but not Drp1-CysOH.
We will use various innovative reagents, methods and mice including biotin-labelled Cys-OH trapping probe;
BiFC-based protein-protein interaction in situ; real-time imaging of cytosol- and mitoROS using redox-sensitive
biosensors; newly developed EC-specific Drp1-/- mice and CRISPR/Cas9-generated “redox dead” Cys
oxidation-defective Drp1 or AMPK knock-in mutant mice. Our proposal will provide novel mechanistic
insights into Cys oxidized mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 that orchestrates NOX/mito ROS signaling and
glycolysis as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of ischemic cardiovascular diseases."

Platelet counts are tightly regulated in order to prevent thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications associated
with thrombocytosis or thrombocytopenia, respectively. While strides have been made in our understanding of
proplatelet formation (PPF), there is still limited knowledge regarding the mechanisms through which the bone
marrow (BM) extracellular matrix (ECM) regulates platelet production. Indeed, the BM includes a rich ECM with
potential to generate mechanical constraints. Yet, the impact of BM mechanics on megakaryocyte (MK)
properties and platelet formation has been understudied. Here, we propose an integrative approach to
investigate emerging concepts related to the role of MK mechanobiological receptors in controlling MK
adhesion to the ECM and platelet production. Our ultimate goal is to understand how specific MK
mechanosensors sense the BM matrix to affect the cellular cytoskeleton, MK properties and, importantly,
platelet level. Building upon our novel findings, Aim 1 explores the new paradigm and hypothesis that distinct
MK cation channels preferentially respond to different BM matrix proteins and inversely impact the MK
cytoskeleton and platelet levels. Experiments will focus on the Piezo family of cation channel mechanosensors,
as compared to the Transient Receptor Potential cation channel subfamily V member 4 mechanosensor. In
recent studies, we found these mechanosensors to have distinct preferences for different matrix proteins and
opposing effects on PPF. Investigations will be carried out using pharmacological approaches as well as newly
generated knockout mice at baseline and in response to challenges, such as myelosuppression or
thrombocytopenia. Encouraged by preliminary studies using human primary MKs, continued studies will
confirm murine findings. Aim 2 delineates mechanisms mediating novel connections between MK
mechanosensors, integrin receptors activation, cytoskeletal changes, and MK mechano-sensitive transcription
factors. This proposal is significant as there is need to identify new and alternative thrombopoietic pathways
and agents that modulate platelet counts. In addition to conceptual innovation, at the technical level we will
analyze new mouse models we developed with deletion of specific mechanosensors in MKs, and will apply
state-of-the-art imaging and measurements under flow to follow cellular processes. Proposed studies are
expected to yield new insights on the role of selective ECM sensing by MKs in controlling the MK cytoskeleton,
adhesion and platelet production, with significant potential to impact our ability to modulate platelet levels."
10896263,"SUMMARY
This application asks how localized mRNA stability modifies axonal regeneration capacity, focusing on
contributions of the RNA binding protein [RBP] KHSRP. The nervous system makes extensive use of post-
transcriptional mechanisms to regulate cellular proteomes in response to extracellular stimuli and
physiologic environments during development, function, & in response to axonal injury. Since one mRNA
can be translated into protein many times over, how long a given mRNA is available for translation impacts
the amount of protein generated from that mRNA. Stability of mRNAs is indeed regulated, with
interactions with RBPs stabilizing & destabilizing different mRNAs, as well as interactions with microRNAs
targeting some targets for degradation. Translation of mRNAs clearly supports axon regeneration, but we
have little knowledge for how stability of axonal mRNAs is locally regulated. We have shown that the RBPs
HuD (also called ELAVL4) and KHSRP (also called FUBP2, MARTA1, & ZBP2) compete for binding to neuronal
mRNAs with AU-rich elements, where HuD interaction stabilizes and KHSRP interaction destabilizes target
mRNAs. At the molecular level, this interaction is impacted by an mRNA’s affinity for binding to HuD or
KHSRP. Our work over years 01-05 show that loss of KHSRP increases KHSRP target mRNA levels, causes
excessive axonal and dendritic growth, impairs memory consolidation in hippocampus & prefrontal cortex,
and increases presynaptic activity in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. KHSRP is expressed into
adulthood, and we surprisingly find that axonal KHSRP levels rapidly increase in peripheral nerves after
injury. This increase in axonal KHSRP occurs through intra-axonal translation of its encoding mRNA. Our
preliminary data indicate that KHSRP knockout mice show accelerated nerve regeneration pointing to
axon-intrinsic functions for KHSRP in regeneration. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that
axonal KHSRP controls the rates of axon regeneration through regulation of localized mRNA stability. We
will test this hypothesis with the following specific aims: 1) Does KHSRP regulate PNS axon regeneration
through a neuron intrinsic mechanism? 2) Does increased axonal KHSRP limit axon regeneration by
destabilizing axonal mRNAs encoding regeneration-associated proteins? and 3) Does KHSRP’s protein
interactome influence its intra-axonal functions? Completion of the studies here will begin to fill this
knowledge gap by focusing on RNA-protein interactions initiated in axons that can affect mRNA survival.
This will provide the first subcellular analyses of RBP domain-specific RNA regulons and will bring the first
systematic assessment for contributions of RNA survival to peripheral nerve regeneration."

The period following release from incarceration is associated with increased risk for HIV and STI acquisition
and transmission and fatal drug overdose. Implementation of effective programs for linkage to pre-exposure
prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV, screening for HIV/STIs/ hepatitis C virus (HCV), and rapid SUD treatment and
harm-reduction services in reentry populations is needed to counteract these harms. Scale up of such
programs may help to address racial/ethnic disparities in these outcomes given the overrepresentation of Black
and Latino people, sexual and gender minority people, and people who inject drugs in jails and prisons. The
proposed research Hub will study the implementation of a demonstrated-effective, 6-month intervention
designed to increase PrEP use and HIV/STI/HCV testing following reentry, in three high-priority California
counties. The Mobile Enhanced Prevention Support or MEPS intervention combines evidence-based
strategies, including Peer Mentors, cash incentives, and a mobile application for facilitating access, goal
tracking, and receipt of incentives. In the first (R61) phase of the project, we will adapt the MEPS
implementation to practical realities of new agencies in new areas. In the second (R33) phase, we will conduct
a Type 3 Hybrid Implementation-Effectiveness study using a stepped-wedge design to evaluate the adapted
MEPS intervention in Riverside, San Bernardino, and Alameda counties. Our academic-community partnership
will also provide infrastructure for robust stakeholder engagement and support of pilot studies related to
prevention during reentry. Our Study Aims are to: 1) Pilot the following aspects of the MEPS trial in one county:
participant recruitment and enrollment; baseline needs assessment and client-centered planning sessions;
retention and follow-up assessments; specimen collection for PrEP adherence monitoring; and peer mentor
identification and training for the full intervention. 2a). Formalize partnerships with community agencies in each
county and plans and adaptations for implementation of MEPS and the trial in their sites. 2b). Develop a set of
common core measures with community and justice system partners and other components of the NIDA
HIV/Justice Research Network. 3) Conduct a Type 3 Hybrid Effectiveness Trial, implementing the adapted
MEPS intervention in the 3 counties, with 300 participants. Use the RE-AIM framework and Proctor's
Implementation Science outcomes with a subset of participants, agency staff, and stakeholders to examine
MEPS' implementation and a step-wedge trial design to assess intervention effectiveness for increasing PrEP
uptake and adherence (self-reported and Tenofovir levels in hair), HIV testing, and SUD service utilization. 4)
Create and deploy a website as a Community Commons, with integrated research and communications utilities
designed to meet the study coordination, community engagement, and implementation needs of Hub partners
in Aims 1-3; disseminate findings related to MEPS intervention scale-up and other Hub activities, (e.g., pilot
studies); and support the sustainability and breadth of intervention adoption and knowledge production."
10892235,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Every day, an estimated 3.9 billion people take medication to treat acute or chronic conditions. However, despite
the enormous utility of current pharmaceuticals, they are limited by several factors that prevent their more
effective and expanded use. Ideally, drugs would reach the desired concentration at the site of action for the
duration that the therapy is required. In practice, this is difficult because the body is constantly metabolizing and
excreting drugs, which necessitates re-administration. Depending on a drug’s therapeutic window and biological
half-life, frequent administration may be required, which lowers patients’ adherence to their dosing regimens.
This issue is pervasive with non-adherence rates as high as 50% for chronic diseases, leading to increased
morbidity and mortality and as much as $290 billion in added healthcare costs each year in the U.S. alone. The
field of pharmaceutics has developed formulation methods that reduce administration frequency, including
injectable controlled-release systems composed of drug embedded in biodegradable materials. Unfortunately,
current clinically-approved systems are limited in both the types of molecules that they can deliver and the drug
release kinetics they can achieve. This proposal seeks to develop parenteral drug delivery strategies that
enhance safety and efficacy, improve patient adherence, and enable the sustained release of biological drugs.
We hypothesize that emerging nanofabrication methods (e.g. multi-photon 3D printing) can be used to control
the structure—and thus behavior—of surface-eroding particles containing drug. Because the degradation of
these hydrophobic materials is confined to the surface, drug distributed homogeneously throughout their volume
will be released at a rate proportional to their erosion rate and exposed surface area. Using these methods, we
can model and rationally design microparticle structures that release drug at predictable, geometrically-defined
rates. Although this concept could be applied to achieve a wide array of release kinetics, we are most interested
in attaining zero-order release kinetics, which are desirable for most diseases, and sequential release, which
may be useful for dynamic conditions. Further, because surface eroding materials exclude water, their interior
microenvironment will remain dry and neutral, thus promoting the stability of encapsulated biologics at 37°C. The
features of surface-eroding microparticles run in stark contrast with existing FDA-approved microparticles
composed of bulk-degrading polymers that absorb water and produce acidic degradation products, which makes
it impossible to predict release kinetics a priori, contributes to the degradation of encapsulated biologics, and
prevents sequential release. The strategies we propose are only now possible due to the convergence of
advances in manufacturing and chemistry that allow us to exploit structure-function relationships at a scale small
enough to retain microparticle injectability. If successful, this approach has the ability to fundamentally change
how drugs are administered and improve patient outcomes across all of medicine."
10861895,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 In this application we propose continuation of the Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS), a landmark
investigation tracking the cancer and other disease experience of a cohort of nearly 86,000 adults age 40-79 at
cohort entry. By design, two-thirds of the cohort was selected to be African American, the remainder predominantly
non-Hispanic white, to help remedy the underrepresentation of African Americans in health studies and enable
direct black/white comparisons. Recruitment took place during 2002-2009 across 12 southern states, mainly at
Community Health Centers (CHCs), institutions providing basic health and preventive services in underserved
areas. Thus, most of the cohort members, both black and white, had low income and education levels. Participants
were recruited from across a span from remote rural to urban areas of the south. The recruitment approach
resulted in the SCCS comprising vulnerable segments of the American population at elevated risk of
cancer and other chronic illnesses seldom if ever included in large numbers in other cohorts. In addition to
detailed survey data, biospecimens were collected from over 76,000 cohort members at baseline, with bloods
obtained and stored for approximately 39,000, mouth rinses/saliva for 38,000 and urines for 24,000, so that
genomic DNA could be extracted from nearly 90% participants. In 2018, we initiated stool sample collection and
anticipate collecting fecal samples from ~9,000 cohort members by 2021, providing the only repository of fecal
samples available for gut microbiome research among large numbers of African Americans and underserved
populations. No other cohort has a collection of baseline biospecimens from African Americans as
comprehensive as the SCCS.
 We thus seek renewal of the U01 infrastructure grant to continue the operational aspects of this highly
successful study which is yielding important information regarding risks and outcomes of cancer according to race,
socioeconomic status and rurality. The SCCS is poised to produce even greater benefit in the coming years as the
cohort matures and even larger numbers of cancer events (now exceeding 10,600) occur. In the current grant
period alone, SCCS data and biologic samples have been used by >300 researchers across over 57 institutions,
examining many important issues related to cancer disparities. We therefore propose to (1) continue passive follow-
up of the cohort via established linkages with various national and state registries to identify deaths, incident
cancers, and other health outcomes; (2) continue active follow-up via re-contact with participants to update
exposure and health information; (3) maintain and enhance the SCCS Biospecimen Repository, adding tumor
tissue collections from a projected 1,500 participants; (4) enhance and expand the SCCS geospatial database,
seeking and geocoding participant residential histories and adding further contextual social, built and environmental
data; and (5) provide overall management of the SCCS and facilitation of resource sharing utilizing SCCS data and
biospecimens. Continuation of the SCCS will enable critical research across the broad scientific community
aimed at the amelioration and eventual elimination of cancer disparities and inequities in the United States."
10883569,"This application is prepared in response to the funding opportunity: NCI Pediatric In Vivo Testing Program
(U01), RFA-CA-20-034 to renew our existing PPTC UO1 grant. Specifically, we propose to continue the in vivo
testing program for central nervous system (CNS) tumors using our panel of patient derived orthotopic xenograft
(PDOX) models. Brain tumor is the leading cause of cancer-related death in children. One of the challenges
in clinical drug development is how to effectively prioritize drug candidates to ensure clinical success in
cancer patients. However, efforts in identifying new anti-cancer agents for that are most likely to be effective
in the clinic have been blocked for many years due to the lack of clinically relevant and molecularly
accurate model system. Fortunately, we have established a panel of 150 PDOX models of pediatric brain
tumors through direct injection of patient tumor specimens into the brains of SCID mice. These PDOX models
are shown to have replicated the histopathology and major genetic abnormalities of the original patient
tumors even during serial sub-transplantations in vivo in mouse brains. They not only represent different
clinical stage (i.e., at diagnosis, relapse and terminal/autopsy) but also replicate a broad spectrum of the newly
identified molecular subtypes of nearly all types of pediatric brain tumors. The xenograft tumor cells can also
be cryopreserved for sustained and on-demand supply of tumorigenic PDOX cells. This capacity combined
with our optimized surgical procedure, with which we can implant up to 260 mice per day, makes it possible for
us to test multiple (e.g., 6-10) drugs per year for every tumor type. Our objective is therefore to make use of
this unique panel of PDOX models to examine therapeutic efficacy of new agents and to analyze mechanisms
of action and therapy resistance in high grade glioma, medulloblastoma, ependymoma, DIPG and ATRT. Our
hypothesis is that these patient-specific PDOX tumors will respond to anti-cancer therapies similarly to the
corresponding human primary tumors, and the effective agents identified through this system would have
better chances of clinical success. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of in vitro and in vivo
assays to achieve the following aims: 1) to identify genetically accurate candidate PDOX models that bear
the therapeutic target(s) of new investigational drugs through data mining of our mouse model molecular
characterization databases; 2) to select the most responsive models through functional in vitro screening to
determine time- and dose-responses; 3) to demonstrate therapeutic efficacy of new investigational drugs
in multiple target-bearing PDOX models; and 4) to perform detailed analysis of cellular and molecular
mechanisms of cell killing as well as the causes of therapy resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Our novel
panel of PDOX mouse models represents a broad spectrum of genetic abnormalities of pediatric CNS
tumors. All the assays are well established and routinely performed in our laboratory; we are uniquely
positioned to accomplish the proposed drug studies in vivo. Our findings should provide strong preclinical
evidence to support the initiation of clinical trials."

10846734,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A major challenge for the development of effective, disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
and related dementias (ADRD) has been our incomplete understanding of the molecular processes controlling
pathogenesis. Important clues for the key molecular pathways controlling AD/ADRD pathogenesis are likely to
be gained from the study of selective vulnerability of neurons to AD/ADRD. While different factors are likely to
contribute to selective vulnerability, our central hypothesis is that cell-autonomous pathways in neurons
contribute to selective vulnerability in AD/ADRD, and that these pathways are potential therapeutic targets to
reduce neuronal vulnerability to disease. Therefore, there is an urgent need to uncover the neuronal pathways
casually driving selective vulnerability, and to test their therapeutic potential. In order to uncover determinants of
selective vulnerability in AD, we previously used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to provide the first molecular
description of selectively vulnerable neurons in the human entorhinal cortex, a brain region affected early in AD
by tau pathology and neuronal loss. Neuronal subtypes that were lost early in disease were also selectively
affected by tau pathology. This work provided us with a list of differentially expressed genes between relatively
vulnerable versus resilient neuronal populations. The next challenge is to determine which of these differentially
expressed genes causally contributes to selective vulnerability. To establish a causal role of specific differentially
expressed genes in selective vulnerability, we will leverage CRISPRi technology, which enables the control of
expression levels of endogenous genes. CRISPRi was co-developed by MPI Dr. Kampmann, who also
pioneered CRISPRi in human iPSC-derived neurons and optimized its use in mouse brains (see preliminary
results). In a genome-wide CRISPRi modifier screen in human iPSC-derived neurons, we identified several
pathways controlling levels of tau pathology. By comparing hits from the CRISPRi screen to genes that are
differentially expressed between resilient and vulnerable neurons in the human AD brain, we uncovered
candidate resilience factors, including an CUL5 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (Aim 1) and candidate vulnerability
factors, including key glycolytic enzymes (Aim 2). The goal of Aim 3 is to conduct a large-scale CRISPRi screen
for factors controlling tau pathology directly in the brain of tauopathy mouse models. The focus of the proposed
project is to uncover mechanisms underlying selective neuronal vulnerability in AD and ADRD. These
mechanisms represent potential therapeutic targets, and future research will test the therapeutic potential of
targeting the identified pathways. The experimental strategy we propose to establish here to uncover
mechanisms underlying selective vulnerability to tauopathy will provide a blueprint that can be applied to many
other neurodegenerative diseases."

Interleukin 6 (IL-6) trans-signaling is a non-canonical signaling paradigm that is greatly enhanced in humans by
the IL-6R Ala358 isoform (rs2228145; Asp358Ala), a variant that occurs at a high frequency across multiple
ethnicities. Emerging evidence suggests that IL-6 trans-signaling contributes to cardiovascular (CV) disease
pathogenesis and that the IL6R Ala358 variant is a predictor of fatal CV outcomes in patients with heart failure
(HF). Thus the IL6R Ala358 variant may be an essential stratification factor for disease risk and response to
therapies targeting IL-6 trans-signaling in subjects with CV disease or HF.
Given the high prevalence of IL6R Ala358 in the population, its link to adverse CV outcomes, evidence of IL-6
trans-signaling in the development of cardiac fibrosis, and the availability of pharmacological strategy, it is
fundamental to confirm the role of IL6R Ala358 in cardiac inflammation and fibrosis and that IL-6 trans-signaling
blockade is an effective treatment strategy. In this application, we will use trans-aortic constriction to cause
cardiac pressure overload (PO) in our novel C57BL/6 Il6raE357A mouse model of IL-6 trans-signaling. We
hypothesize that increased circulating IL-6 produced in response to pressure overload (PO) will
exacerbate cardiac fibrosis and HF in the presence of enhanced IL-6 trans-signaling determined by
C57BL/6 Il6raE357A genotype and treatment with sgp130Fc will prevent or attenuate cardiac fibrosis and
HF. Using state of the art spatial transcriptomics, we will identify the specific type and location of cardiac
cells responsive to IL-6 trans-signaling. The goals of this project are:
Aim 1. Assess the impact of the C57BL/6 Il6raE357A mouse genotype of enhanced sIL-6R shedding and
IL-6 trans-signaling on PO-induced cardiac fibrosis and left ventricular dysfunction.
Aim 2. Determine if selective IL-6 trans-signaling blockade with sgp130FC blockade is an effective
strategy to ameliorate PO-induced cardiac fibrosis.
These experiments will establish the proof-of-concept whether enhanced IL-6 trans-signaling increases cardiac
fibrosis and HF risk. We will also explore specific cellular mechanisms by employing advanced spatial
transcriptomics, which allows the identification of cardiac cell type and location affected by IL-6 trans-signaling.
Additionally, given that he sgp130Fc is currently in phase II clinical trials (trade name Olamkicept) we will have
establish a validated biological model to study IL-6 trans-signaling with translational value."

antioxidant. Low levels of serum urate at diagnosis are associated with accelerated disease progression and
lower patient survival in several neurodegenerative diseases. For example, urate levels are lower in Parkinson’s
Disease (PD) patients and this correlates with loss of the striatal dopamine transporter and an advanced clinical
progression in motor deficits. Similarly, several studies have suggested that urate levels may offer value as a
prognostic biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) progression, yet it remains unclear why low uric
acid reflects poor survival. Recently, a large effort to increase urate levels (inosine supplementation) in PD
patients offered no clinical benefit or improvement in patient outcomes. Why does the supplementation of a major
plasma antioxidant confer no benefit to patients in diseases where oxidative stress is known to be present?
Our expertise in studying the chemical modification of proteins by metabolites led us to consider an alternative
fate of urate when oxidative stress may overwhelm the regeneration of urate antioxidant capacity. We
hypothesize that low plasma urate instead reflects increased oxidation of urate to generate reactive urate radicals
that can chemically modify protein lysine residues, altering protein structure or function, a process known as
protein uratylation. The balance between urate antioxidant benefit, and urate oxidation to damaging radicals,
may uniquely depend on the location and nature of the oxidative stress. In this R03 we are embarking on
exploratory studies to better understand why urate therapy may not have been as successful as anticipated. Our
goal is to generate and validate new tools that will assist movement disorders researchers in the future in testing
the relevance of protein uratylation across a range of preclinical models and human biospecimens."
10767360,"Coccidioides immitis and C. posadasii are two species of soil fungi that cause the disease coccidioidomycosis,
(or Valley fever), whose incidence has increased 587% over the last 20 years and now causes over 150,000
new infections in the United States annually. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report that
average cost for treating Valley fever is over $50,000 per patient and delays or misdiagnosis of Valley fever
result in an average of $590,000 in extra healthcare costs, including extensive hospital stays and a lifetime of
treatment. Current Valley fever diagnostic tests are based on proprietary antibodies or antigens, which may not
be easily accessed. We propose that advanced genomic analyses of these fungal pathogens can support the
identification of new biomarkers and embody the foundational framework that is necessary for development of
new diagnostic tools. We aim to improve the diagnostics available for detection of Coccidioides spp. by analyzing
existing genomic data and using in silico predictions to identify several putative antigens that are highly
expressed during host infection and would likely interact with the host. We will express these novel antigens
along with standard control CF and TP antigens from Coccidioides in a model organism (Escherichia coli) and
use the protein products to create an electrochemical sensor Molecularly Imprinted Polymer (MIP) diagnostic
assay. MIPs are a polymer that has been processed using a molecular imprinting technique which leaves cavities
in the polymer matrix with high affinity for a chosen ‘template’ molecule (in our case the antigens expressed by
E. coli). When paired with an electrochemical biosensor, MIPs can be the basis for a low-cost diagnostic tool
because they mimic biological recognition well enough to be called ‘synthetic antibodies.’ In total, this proposal
represents a unique pairing of advanced genomic data analysis and novel diagnostic development in an
important, yet understudied, fungal pathogen."
10771295,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Ischemic stroke is a debilitating disease that is the leading cause of long-term disability in the US despite the
prevalent use of clinical imaging technologies to identify, diagnose and classify brain injuries. Care and
management of acute ischemic strokes (AIS) due to large vessel occlusion (LVO) (~200,000 cases/year) is
based on endovascular thrombectomy (ET), which improves cerebral blood flow by removing blockage in distal
cerebral arteries. Despite the promise and widespread use of ET, about a third of patients with technically
successful ET procedures develop reperfusion injuries with high degrees of morbidity and mortality, often
identified only after-the-fact by standard of care imaging. Indeed, real-time optimization/personalization of
treatment is currently not feasible, because we lack robust technologies that can directly measure CBF or
characterize changes in cerebrovascular function at the bedside. The primary goal of this proposal is to address
this informational gap in bedside monitoring, through a robust noninvasive optical instrument and data
processing scheme. This research will deploy a new noninvasive Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy (DCS)
instrument for fast, depth-sensitive measurement of cerebral blood flow in patients with AIS from LVO. The new
instrument will be used to derive high-fidelity, quantitative measurements of pulsatile cerebral blood flow from
deep cortical microvasculature, during ET therapy. Quantitative measurements of CBF with DCS will be used to
grade/quantify cerebral tissue reperfusion during acute therapy for AIS from LVO. Leveraging the enhanced
capabilities of the new instrument, this proposal will utilize measurements of steady-state fluctuations in cortical
cerebral blood flow and arterial blood pressure to quantify cerebrovascular autoregulation (CVAR). CVAR is a
functional biomarker of cerebrovascular tissue health and is predictive of injury severity and stroke recovery. In
the same cohort of patients with AIS with LVO, the new DCS instrument will be used to estimate and track
changes in CVAR at the patient’s bedside over the first 24 hours after ET, when reperfusion injuries are thought
to occur. Longitudinal measurements of CVAR will be correlated with radiographical assessments of the brain at
24 hours post-ET, to evaluate if CVAR changes are predictive of reperfusion injuries. Clinical application of the
innovative strategies proposed here will lead to transformative breakthroughs in bedside monitoring of ischemic
stroke by providing neurologists with vital real-time physiological information about cerebrovascular function,
paving the way for personalized treatments, precision medicine and improved patient outcomes."
10839931,"Project Summary. Epilepsy is the second most prevalent neurological disorder, affecting approximately 2
million people in the United States. While many patients achieve satisfactory seizure control with
pharmacotherapy, a significant proportion (20-40%) have medically intractable seizures. For these patients,
identification of novel methods for seizure control is a high priority. One such method may be to harness
endogenous seizure suppressive circuits in the brain. Because seizures may have multiple or unknown
initiation sites, focal stimulation approaches (e.g., deep brain stimulation [DBS]) that can control seizures
originating in diverse brain networks are highly desirable. The circuitry of the basal ganglia has received
particular attention in this regard. While four decades of research have elaborated the specific nuclei that can
contribute to this effect, the precise pathways, projections, and circuit architecture remain obscure. Building on
our findings in the prior project period, and a robust literature in preclinical epilepsy research, we aim to define
the upstream regulators (basal ganglia direct and indirect pathways; Aim 1), midbrain local circuits (deep layers
of superior colliculus [DLSC]-pedunculopontine nucleus [PPN] interactions; Aim 2), and PPN projection targets
(Aim 3) that mediate the antiseizure effects of the basal ganglia. Our goal is to develop a comprehensive
macro-network map and to determine how, at the circuit level, manipulations in this circuit lead to broad-
spectrum resistance to seizures. We expect that a deeper understanding of this circuitry will lead to novel
interventions to control seizures. In Specific Aim 1, we will monitor and modulate activity in the basal ganglia
direct and indirect pathways through a combination of optogenetics, in vivo single-unit recording, and fiber
photometry in models of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and absence epilepsy. In Specific Aim 2, we will define
the midbrain (DLSC-PPN) circuits engaged by limbic and absence seizure activity and test the functional
relationship between DLSC and PPN in controlling seizures. We will address this by combining in vivo single-
unit recording, slice electrophysiology, and optogenetics. In Specific Aim 3, we will define PPN output targets
that mediate protection against limbic and absence seizures, focusing on the mediodorsal and reticular
thalamic nucleus, using temporal lobe and absence epilepsy models. Together the proposed studies will
provide proof of principle for optogenetic modulation of seizures in diverse networks from a single circuit.
Moreover, this approach allows us to examine previously untestable hypotheses about the connections that
mediate basal ganglia seizure control. Finally, the proposed experiments aim to uncover the circuit and
neurotransmitter mechanism by which focal manipulations in motor control regions (i.e., SNpr/DLSC) translate
into brain-wide changes in excitability."
10911040,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Solid organ transplant recipients have increased morbidity and mortality in response to infection with SARS-
CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID19. While the general population has greatly benefited from the rapid
development of several vaccines that are protective against the development of severe infection, the transplant
recipient population has sub-optimal responses to similar vaccination regimens. Herein, we build on our
published and preliminary data on the cellular and serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in
both liver and kidney transplant recipients. Liver transplant recipients are significantly more likely to respond to
a two-dose regimen with both viral specific T cells and seroconversion when compared with kidney transplant
recipients. Interestingly, although both seroconversion efficiency and T cell activation are affected by the levels
of immunosuppression, the organ transplanted (liver versus kidney) has an independent effect on the humoral
and cellular responses. However, an in depth, mechanistic evaluation of these adaptive immune responses is
lacking. We hypothesize that there are intrinsic differences in immune function, irrespective of the degree of
immunosuppression, between liver and kidney transplant recipients. This proposal builds on an already
productive collaboration between the laboratories of Jonathan Maltzman and Paolo Cravedi. The overall goal
of this work is to use cryopreserved samples to mechanistically understand the features that
characterize effective immune response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in kidney transplant recipients. To
address this goal, we propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: Assess the differences in T cell phenotype
and function between solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients that are SARS-CoV-2 vaccine responders
versus non-responders; Aim 2: Determine differences in innate and adaptive immune cell populations
between vaccine responders versus non-responders by measuring chromatin accessibility and gene
expression. This project builds upon the productive collaboration between the Maltzman and Cravedi
laboratories and leverages their expertise. Success of this high-risk proposal has the potential to
comprehensively delineate the immune responses in both kidney and liver transplant recipients upon SARS-
CoV-2 vaccination, a point of critical importance to define biomarkers of response and envision strategies to
improve response (high reward)."
10793583,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Growth plate injuries, which account for 30% of all pediatric fractures, can impair bone growth and even halt it
completely. For children who are still growing, these injuries can be devastating. The growth plate (or physis) is
a cartilage region found at the end of all long bones in children and is responsible for longitudinal bone growth.
It is a weak area of the developing skeleton and prone to injury. Once damaged, cartilage tissue within the growth
plate can be replaced by unwanted bony tissue, forming a “bony bar”, which can lead to angular deformities or
complete growth arrest. Pediatric patients who sustain these injuries may require multiple surgical interventions
during childhood. Innovative treatment strategies that prevent initial bony bar formation, thus avoiding growth
deformities and potential lifelong disability, are critically needed. The goal of this project is to develop clinically
useful treatment strategies for growth plate injuries that prevent bony bar formation and associated growth
problems. One approach is to target mechanisms responsible for unwanted bony repair tissue, which include
angiogenic signaling pathways. These pathways are regulated at many levels and can be modulated by insoluble
cues such as extracellular matrix factors. The modulation of these cues via a material-only system could provide
significant benefit to ultimate translation of such a regenerative therapy. Our hypothesis is that targeted disruption
of angiogenic signaling cascades after growth plate injury through insoluble cues such as extracellular matrix
factors will inhibit angiogenesis and completely prevent bony bar formation. We will examine this with the
following 2 aims: AIM 1: To quantify the impact of hyaluronic acid (HA) on the angiogenic response that occurs
after growth plate injury. As HA is known to be important in angiogenic signaling, but as its effect can be varied
in different physiologic settings and as its impact in the growth plate after injury has not been studied, here we
will investigate varying molecular weights of HA. Angiogenesis and bony bar prevention will be evaluated in our
rat model of growth plate injury using bulk RNA-seq, microCT, immunostaining and histological assessment. AIM
2: To quantify the impact of specific peptide sequences on the angiogenic response that occurs after growth
plate injury. Here 4 different peptides with established inhibitory effects on angiogenesis and osteogenesis will
be covalently linked to our alginate hydrogels to study their influence on cell behavior. This Aim will quantify the
impact of these peptides on angiogenesis, osteogenesis, and chondrogenesis in vitro and on the angiogenesis
and osteogenesis that occurs in vivo in a rat growth plate injury model, as quantified using bulk RNAseq, microCT,
immunostaining, and histological assessment. This project will provide important information about the impact of
extracellular matrix cues in de novo growth plate injury healing and bony bar formation, supporting the
development of novel biomaterial-based approaches to preventing bony bar formation. Ultimately, we will
translate the technology to larger animal models of growth plate injuries, and eventually into the clinic. This
research will help address a critical unmet clinical need for children suffering from growth plate injuries."
10849842,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Coordinated regulation of protein synthesis, trafficking, post-translational modification and
degradation is a basic requirement for cellular function. Targeted protein degradation in
eukaryotic cells is largely carried out by the proteasome. The proteasome allows dynamic
regulation of protein stability and enforces protein quality control by removing defective
proteins. Importantly, demand for protein degradation by the proteasome within individual
cells can vary due to endogenous signals or exogenous stressors. Thus, condition-specific
regulation of proteasome capacity to maintain adequate, but avoid excessive, protein
degradation is needed to ensure normal development and physiology. Failure to appropriately
regulate the proteasome is implicated in disease. For example, deficient proteasome capacity is
associated with neurodegenerative conditions, whereas proteasome levels and activity are
often elevated in cancerous cells. We do not understand how cells dynamically maintain
appropriate proteasome capacity to meet changing cellular needs. Critically, we do not
understand how the failure or hyperactivity of these mechanisms contributes to disease. Here I
propose a forward genetic approach in C. elegans to discover the factors that control
proteasome capacity, understand how they work at the molecular level, uncover their roles in
normal development, and begin to identify how they may mitigate or contribute to disease. We
will (1) use simple GFP-based reporter assays to perform large-scale genetic screens that will
comprehensively identify proteasome capacity regulators and (2) characterize novel
proteasome regulators we have discovered through these screens. (3) We will uncover how
alterations to specific proteasome subunits differentially alter protein degradation capacity,
development, and proteasome inhibitor resistance. This work will improve our understanding
of the fundamental cellular mechanisms that regulate proteasome capacity in a whole animal
context. In the long-term, these insights will form the conceptual basis for pharmacological
interventions that improve human health via modulation of cellular protein degradation
capacity."

10901982,"Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a common inherited disorder. Iron overload results in damage to specific organs including the liver, heart, and pancreas resulting in cirrhosis of the liver, liver cancer, diabetes, cardiomyopathy. Iron also accumulates in joints causing arthritis. The liver is the major iron-sensing organ and controls iron homeostasis in the body. Mutations in transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2), HFE and hemojuvelin (HJV) lead to HH. TfR2 is hypothesized to sense iron in the body. The role that TfR2 plays in sensing iron remains controversial. The association between TfR2 and HFE is still debated. TfR2 also associates with HJV in vitro. We propose to determine the mechanisms by which TfR2 controls iron homeostasis in the body. Adeno- associated viral vectors used in gene therapy trials in combination with protein proximity assays and phosphoproteomic analysis will be utilized to determine the interaction partners of TfR2 in vivo. The long-term goal of this research is to understand how mutations in key proteins that disturb the iron balance in the body, reveal the mechanisms by which the body regulates iron-homeostasis."
10915723,"ABSTRACT
Protein folding in the cell is critically dependent on the assistance of molecular chaperones. The ring-shaped
chaperonins are essential members of the cellular folding machinery. These large protein complexes consist of
two stacked seven- to nine-membered rings. Chaperonins bind unfolded substrates in their central cavity and
use binding and hydrolysis of ATP to mediate polypeptide folding. Substrate proteins are thought to fold upon
encapsulation in the central cavity formed by each ring. The long term goal of this program is to understand
how the chaperonin of eukaryotic cells, TRiC, mediates polypeptide folding., TRiC is hetero-oligomeric and
uses ATP cycling to open and close a built-in lid over the central chamber. Intriguingly, TRiC has the ability to
fold some eukaryotic proteins, such as actin, that cannot be folded by any other chaperone. Despite its essential
role in cellular folding, little is known about the mechanism and substrate binding properties of TRiC.
Our work in the previous funding period provided important mechanistic and structural insights into this
chaperonin. We established that the conformational cycle of TRiC is significantly different from that of
bacterial chaperonins and demonstrated subunit diversity confers dramatic functional asymmetry to this
seemingly symmetric chaperonin. Importantly, in the previous funding period we developed a recombinant
system to study this chaperonin that for the first time makes it possible to generating mutants that can be
studies functionally and structurally. These breakthroughs enable us to study how TRiC facilitates folding in
unprecedented detail, through the following proposed aims:
1. Characterize of the nucleotide cycle of the chaperonin TRiC: Chaperonins use ATPase cycling to
promote conformational changes leading to protein folding. We want to understand how the ATPase cycle of
TRiC is coordinated among the different TRiC subunits, and how ATP cycling drives conformational changes
in the chaperonin and how the ""built-in"" lid that opens and closes in response to ATP-binding and hydrolysis.
2. Define the molecular basis of TRiC-substrate interactions: Little is known about the molecular basis of
TRiC-substrate interactions. We want to define the substrate recognition code of the binding sites for the
different subunits in the chaperonin and define the motifs within substrates that are recognized by TRiC.
3. Investigate the mechanism of TRiC-assisted substrate folding: The exact role that chaperonins play with
respect to the substrate is still a mystery. We will explore the effect of TRiC on substrate proteins during the
different stages of the folding cycle by combining biochemical approaches together with crosslinking and
fluorescence spectroscopy.
Importantly, recent observations have highlighted the links between TRiC and several pathological states
incuding cancer, viral infection and neurodegeneration. Thus our project deciphering the mechanism of this
chaperonin in cellular folding will help develop therapies to ameliorate these human diseases."

This study evaluates the enduring protective impacts of a multi-level evidence-based intervention, ParentCorps,
in high-poverty schools with pre-Kindergarten (pre-K) programs serving primarily Black and Latino children in
New York City (NYC) neighborhoods hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, Black and Latino children in
NYC are more than twice as likely as White children to lose a parent to COVID-19. COVID-19-related financial
and social stresses have been especially hard on households with young children. Reports on the well-being of
families with young children document substantial increases in adversity in many areas, including lack of
household basic needs and loss of economic security, physical and mental health impacts on caregivers and
household members, lack of access to early learning and childcare, and wide-ranging concerns about child social
emotional well-being. Structural racism, poverty and other social determinants, combined with a surge in
exposure to new adverse childhood experiences (e.g., parental depression, illness or death of a family member,
threat of eviction) that disproportionately affect Black and Latino children, may sharply exacerbate existing
educational and health disparities. In historically disinvested neighborhoods, the pandemic is set to erode
protective factors, such as family-school connections and emotionally responsive home and classroom
environments that support child mental health and school performance. A culturally-responsive intervention that
promotes and maintains positive family-school connections and home/classroom environments in communities
hard hit by COVID-19 may prevent the worsening of racial and ethnic health and education disparities. This study
has the following specific aims: 1) Test the enduring impact of ParentCorps professional development for
educators (2017-2019) on family-school connections as experienced by parents of pre-K students in school
years during and after COVID-19, relative to pre-COVID-19 years; 2) Examine the long-term impact of
ParentCorps programs for children and families on developmental trajectories of the 2019-20 cohort of pre-K
students on mental health and school performance, and test whether intervention impacts on child outcomes
vary by neighborhood-level susceptibility to COVID-19, race, gender and home language; 3) Understand school
assets and unmet needs not addressed directly by ParentCorps; develop and integrate crisis mitigation
strategies into the ParentCorps model; and assess feasibility and benefit. Capitalizing on public investments in
scaling ParentCorps in schools in historically disinvested neighborhoods, strong partnerships with policy makers
and practitioners, and a robust research infrastructure, this study offers an unparalleled opportunity to advance
science and a promising systems-level scalable strategy to prevent cascading negative effects of COVID-19 for
Black and Latino families."

Doxorubicin is a member of the anthracycline group of chemotherapy drugs prescribed to approximately 60% of
pediatric cancer patients suffering with sarcomas, blastomas, leukemia, and lymphoma. Although doxorubicin is
highly effective in these patients, ~16% of pediatric patients suffer doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC) which
can lead to heart failure requiring heart transplant. Our recent work has shown that DIC is 2.5x more
prevalent in African American (AA) survivors of childhood cancer. Despite more than 50 years of research
in this field, there is still, at present, little potential for either predicting or preventing DIC. There is an obvious
need for novel and innovative approaches to overcome this hurdle. Candidate gene and genome-wide
association studies, predominantly in Europeans, have identified >100 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
that are statistically correlated with DIC, yet experimental validation has not been feasible due to the difficulty in
isolating and culturing human cardiomyocytes in vitro. In our recent work, we showed that patient-specific human
induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) are efficient predictors of a patient’s
likelihood of developing DIC, confirming for the first time that there is a genomic basis to DIC. Here, we
hypothesize that hiPSC-CMs can be utilized in three different modalities to study genetic variants associated
with DIC in AA survivors: firstly, to discover novel predictive SNPs; secondly, to validate SNPs; and thirdly, to
examine the modulated pathways and determine genotype-specific cardioprotective methodologies. In Aim 1,
we will generate hiPSC from 100 AA adult survivors of childhood cancer with diverse biological covariates who
were exposed to doxorubicin assess their response to doxorubicin in vitro to validate our previous findings and
verify the power of this tool. In Aim 2, we will use these 100 patient-specific lines to identify drug response
differential expression, splicing and chromatin accessibility quantitative trait loci (deQTL, dsQTL and dcaQTL),
assessing biological covariates such as doxorubicin dose, age at cancer diagnosis, attained age, sex, BMI,
radiotherapy (other than involving chest), and cancer diagnosis both individually and combined. We will then
validate these variants with genome editing, and mechanistically examine pathways causative to DIC
susceptibility concentrating on genes with known roles in cardiomyopathy, cardioprotection, and doxorubicin
metabolism. We will then use the discoveries above to discover/repurpose genome-informed cardioprotective
drugs to prevent DIC in a genotype-specific manner. In Aim 3, we will build a risk prediction model for DIC among
AA survivors incorporating clinical risk factors and functionally assessed genetic variants above, evaluate its
prediction performance, validate it in independent AA survivors, and implement it in a web-based and user-
friendly tool for broader clinical and research use. In summary, this work will deliver us the genetic rationale for
why AA survivors experience DIC and provide 1, fully human validated SNP data for clinical application through
a user-friendly tool, and 2, novel cardioprotective pathways that can be targeted to protect against DIC."

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory condition of the brain and spinal cord mediated largely by
pathogenic T cell responses to myelin antigens, resulting in demyelination of the central nervous system
(CNS). Myelin-reactive T cells are also crucial for induction of the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
(EAE) mouse model of MS. Studies of MS and EAE implicate CD4 T helper (Th) cells in disease pathogenesis,
including pro-inflammatory Th17 and Th1 cells. In this regard, the disease-promoting ability of these T cell
subsets stems from both their capacity to target and infiltrate the CNS and their pro-inflammatory effector
function. An interplay between genetic and environmental factors is implicated in the pathogenesis of MS.
However, despite a wealth of genome wide association data (GWAS) data revealing a strong genetic
contribution to MS, it has been challenging to identify the bona fide disease-promoting gene target(s) of many
risk-associated variants, and the cellular compartment in which they contribute to dysregulation. In preliminary
work, we have applied global genomics approaches to map MS-associated noncoding risk variants to their
long-range target gene by physically capturing enhancer-promoter interactions. These MS-implicated genes
were further prioritized based on dysregulated expression signatures in pathogenic Th17 cells derived from MS
patients. Using this approach, we have identified putative regulatory MS variants and gene targets that control
CD4 T cell function in MS that are the basis of this application. We hypothesize that identifying noncoding
variants that alter the regulatory function of cis elements controlling proinflammatory T cells will provide novel
mechanistic insights into the underlying etiology governing the development of MS. Here, we propose an
integrative strategy to prioritize and validate causal genetic variants in MS pathogenesis. The goal of Aim 1 is
to determine the contribution of noncoding risk variants to CD4 T cell gene regulation. In particular, we will
employ a combination of high-throughput regulatory reporter assays and machine learning approaches to
identify SNPs with regulatory function in primary human CD4 T cells. In Aim 2, we will determine the
mechanism by which these regulatory variants contribute to altered T cell function and pathogenicity in MS.
Complementary CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic and epigenetic perturbations will define the enhancer context
of risk alleles and delineate bona fide regulatory gene targets of regulatory risk variants. Moving from genotype
to phenotype, we will define true causal variants that contribute to disease etiology in the context of an intact
immune system using genetic interventions that model conserved risk variants in mice. Together, the proposed
experiments will advance our understanding of the both the genetic and cellular mechanisms governing Th17
cell pathogenicity in MS and discover new loci with unknown functions in disease etiology."
10847504,"The overall goal of our proposed research is to develop robust premortem biomarkers for accurate and
differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), non-AD tauopathies, Lewy body dementia (LBD), and their
comorbidities. A pathological hallmark of AD and other tauopathies is the deposition of tau protein aggregates
in the brain, whereas in LBD there is accumulation of α-synuclein (aSyn) aggregates. Strikingly, more than half
of patients with clinically diagnosed AD or LBD have concomitant tau and aSyn co-pathologies at autopsy.
Moreover, patients with mixed tau and aSyn pathologies often suffer from worse clinical outcomes. Currently, it
is highly challenging to clinically differentiate AD, LBD, and mixed AD/LBD due to overlapping symptoms.
Moreover, co-existence of aSyn pathology also occurs frequently in non-AD tauopathies. Recent advances in
brain imaging and immunoassays of amyloid-β and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) have greatly facilitated diagnosis
of typical AD. However, these assays fail to identify non-AD tauopathies and mixed AD/LBD. Therefore,
alternative measures in easily accessible biospecimens are warranted, especially if they enable simultaneous
detection of tau and aSyn aggregates in patients with mixed tauopathies and synucleinopathies. In preliminary
studies, we have leveraged the newly emerged technology known as the real-time quaking-induced conversion
assay (tau RT-QuIC) for specific detection of tau aggregates in the skin of patients with AD and non-AD
tauopathies. In conjunction with recently established aSyn RT-QuIC, we are in a unique position to accurately
diagnose patients with mixed tau and aSyn pathologies using easily accessible skin specimens. We hypothesize
that skin tau and aSyn detected by RT-QuIC are novel biomarkers for early and differential diagnosis of
mixed tauopathies/synucleinopathies in routine clinical practice. We propose to test this hypothesis by
pursuing three Aims: 1) Establish dual skin RT-QuIC biomarker assays for mixed tauopathies/synucleinopathies
using neuropathologically confirmed cases; 2) Assess skin tau and aSyn detected by RT-QuIC as reliable
biomarkers for premortem diagnosis of mixed tauopathies and synucleinopathies; and 3) Evaluate skin tau/aSyn
biomarker assays for improving the differential diagnosis of mixed tauopathies/synucleinopathies through
longitudinal follow-up. This translational project is supported by rich clinical resources and a strong team of basic
and clinical neuroscientists. The successful outcome of our proposal will establish a robust skin-based diagnostic
test for mixed pathologies that is prevalent in AD and related dementias, thus facilitating better patient care and
development of disease-modifying therapies."
10828871,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Identification and treatment of risk factors that accelerate Alzheimer's disease (AD)
are essential to slowing disease progression. Alphaherpesviruses (herpes simplex virus type 1 [HSV-1], varicella
zoster virus [VZV]) are potential accelerators of AD because they increase dementia risk and produce similar
pathologies, including amyloid, neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and cognitive impairment1-3. In
parallel literature, early AD is characterized by smell loss4,5, amyloid deposition in olfactory epithelium (OE)6,7,
and olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) dysfunction (reviewed in8). Because sniff-induced gamma () oscillations
generated in olfactory bulb (OB) are directionally coupled to the hippocampus9-12, smell loss would result in
decreased hippocampal  oscillations that have been postulated to lead to neurodegeneration and cognitive
decline.14-16 Because alphaherpesviruses infect and reactivate in the nasal cavity, alphaherpesvirus disruption of
olfactory pathways may accelerate AD. Our preliminary data show: (1) compared to controls, OB and olfactory
tract (OT) from familial AD (FAD) subjects have upregulation of viral and inflammatory transcriptional
pathways , confirmed at the protein level; (2) VZV immediate early protein 62 was detected in serum of 2 of 3
AD subjects and in 0/4 controls; (3) HSV-1- and VZV-infected human OE cultures (OECs) contain amyloid and
increased OSN differentiation; and, (4) intranasal HSV-1-infected 5xFAD mice have increased OE amyloid and
decreased olfaction compared to uninfected or pre-inoculation controls, respectively. Taken together, we
hypothesize that alphaherpesvirus infection of the OE contributes to pathological processes within the olfactory
system and hippocampus, thereby accelerating disease. To test this hypothesis, we will: (Aim 1) identify
gene
hippocampus, (Aim 2) determine
whether infection of human OE with VZV and HSV-1 ex vivo elicits amyloid production and
loss of odorant responsiveness, recapitulating smell loss in AD; and (Aim 3) test whether HSV-
1 worsens olfactory dysfunction in 5xFAD mice, accelerating the AD phenotype; specifically, we
will test whether HSV-1-induced pathology and functional changes are diminished by
optogenetic stimulation of mitral/tufted cells in the  frequency range and if entrainment of
hippocampal  oscillations can prevent cellular and behavioral deficits elicited by HSV-
1. Understanding how viruses interact with the aging olfactory system, as well as with individuals who
overexpress amyloidogenic peptides (FAD), to accelerate AD will identify potential biomarkers and therapies
(e.g. vaccines or antiviral agents) that may slow or halt progression to clinical dementia, disability, and death.

10819543,"Targeted control of self-transmissible plasmids by using engineered interfering plasmids
Abstract
 Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) are genetic materials that can move within a genome or between
species, a phenomenon known as horizontal gene transfer (HGT). It is well recognized that HGT plays a critical
role in introducing, maintaining, and spreading diverse functional traits such as metabolic traits, virulence factors,
and antibiotic resistance. For example, in the clinical setting, antibiotic resistance can spread from the resident
microflora to invading pathogens or vice versa. Conversely, use of antibiotics can modulate the overall
conjugation dynamics by affecting the conjugation efficiency (rate of gene exchange) or by selecting for
populations containing mobile plasmids. Therefore, it is critical to develop strategies that can modulate gene
persistence by targeting HGT.
 To this end, we propose to develop a synthetic-biology based intervention strategy that enables
targeted suppression or elimination of self-transmissible plasmids. The strategy exploits the vulnerability
of conjugation to deliver an engineered plasmid to both suppress the conjugation rate and to accelerate loss of
the target plasmid via incompatibility. During conjugation, a mating bridge is established between the donor
cell and the recipient cell, allowing one copy of the self-transmissible plasmid to be transferred to the recipient.
However, at a smaller efficiency, the transfer apparatus allows a mobilizable (but not self-transmissible) plasmid
to be transferred from the recipient to the donor cell. This process is known as retro-transfer. Our design exploits
retro-transfer to deliver our engineered plasmid. Upon entry, an incompatibility element carried by our engineered
plasmid will expel the self-transmissible plasmid that picks up our plasmid in the first place. This exclusion is
enabled by proper control of the selection dynamics. We term this intervention strategy DoS (Denial of Spread)
or DDoS (Distributed Denial of Spread), when generalized to the simultaneous targeting of multiple self-
transmissible plasmids. Our preliminary modeling and experimental analysis have demonstrated the proof of
concept of DoS strategy. Our proposed work will develop and optimize this intervention strategy in depth and
apply it to eliminate self-transmissible plasmids encoding antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria. We
envision that our proposed work will establish a transformative platform for precise control of gene persistence
and flux in microbial communities."
10888351,"Modified Project Summary/Abstract (The abstract contained no specific references to the in vivo mouse experiments and therefore is unchanged): O-GlcNAc modification is a dynamic protein-modification that is absolutely required for embryonic development in mammals, and is misregulated in diseases, including diabetes, neurodegeneration and cancer. Although approximately 1,000 proteins are modified by O-GlcNAc, the effects of the vast majority of these modifications on protein function are completely unknown. The long-term goal of our research program is to fill in these missing gaps by determining the biochemical consequences of O-GlcNAc on proteins that are key to human disease. To accomplish this goal, we use a combination of carbohydrate and synthetic protein chemistries to build O-GlcNAc modified proteins for subsequent biological experiments. This chemical approach is uniquely enabling, as it is currently the only way to generate homogeneous and site-specifically O-GlcNAc modified proteins. We have been very successful and have used synthetic proteins to determine that O-GlcNAc has a multifaceted role in preventing the amyloid aggregation of proteins in neurodegenerative diseases. Specifically, we have found that O-GlcNAc both directly inhibits the aggregation of amyloid forming proteins and activates the activity of certain small chaperones. In this proposal we will continue to build on these discoveries. In Aim 1, we will determine how O-GlcNAc inhibits the early stages of α-synuclein amyloid formation. In Aim 2, we will test whether O-GlcNAc alters the structure/toxicity relationships of α-synuclein amyloids. In Aim 3, we examine how O-GlcNAc alters the small heat shock protein interactome. Finally, in Aim 4, we will determine if O-GlcNAc can rescue the activity of mutant chaperones that cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. At the conclusion of these independent aims, we will have further unravelled the mechanisms by which O-GlcNAc inhibits protein aggregation and provided critical data to support the ongoing efforts to target O-GlcNAc therapeutically."
10892933,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The colon is a major segment of the intestine and differs significantly from the small intestine in
morphology, cell types, physiological function and disease susceptibility. Devastating and prevalent
diseases, including colorectal cancers and ulcerative colitis, arise from colon but not small intestine.
Colon absorbs water but cannot uptake most nutrients like the small intestine and consequently a
significant loss of the small intestine will lead to digestive failure that the colon cannot compensate.
Despite significant progress, aspects of the colon biology remain poorly understood. Molecular
determinants that distinguish the colon from the small intestine and govern colon-specific cell lineage
differentiation and homeostasis remain largely uncharacterized, hindering a deeper understanding of
regionalized intestinal diseases. In preliminary studies, we identified SATB2, a chromatin factor with
restricted expression in the colonic epithelium, as a crucial molecular regulator of colon identity and
differentiation. SATB2 deletion from adult intestine led to a homeotic-like transformation of colonic
epithelium into one that resembles small intestine ileum in cellular composition and gene expression,
and the mutant colon can absorb nutrients, a function unique to the small intestine. These data
suggest that SATB2 is a potential “master regulator” of colonic epithelium. The identification of SATB2
offers a unique opportunity to study colonic ontogeny and fate determination, and assess its
therapeutic implications. In this project, Aim 1 will evaluate the hypothesis that colonic stem cells
harbor primed ileal enhancers and thus harbor a chromatin-level permissiveness for ileal
transcriptional activation and cell fate plasticity. Aim 2 studies will evaluate the hypothesis that SATB2
recruits two chromatin remodeling factors, MTA2 and SMARCD2, to separate pools of colonic and
ileal enhancers to modify local chromatin, allowing differential access of intestinal transcription factors
and effecting transcriptional regulation. In Aim 3, using mouse models of Short bowel syndrome
(SBS), we will evaluate whether promoting colonic nutrient absorption can combat digestive failure
and the associated pathophysiology in SBS. These studies together will elucidate the cellular and
molecular mechanisms by which SATB2 preserves colonic identity and effects a colonic to ileal
conversion, which may be exploited as a novel therapeutic approach to treat SBS."
10881898,"Delivered RNAi products have now been FDA approved for treating two genetic disorders resulting from
mutations affecting genes expressed in the liver. Gene vector delivered cassettes that produce siRNAs
have an advantage for genetic disorders because of the potential for a one-shot cure. We solved one of the
mysteries of how over expression of therapeutic RNAi (transcriptional RNAi) from an AAV-U6 polII
promoter driven shRNA (AAV-shRNA) caused acute liver toxicity and continue to study this in more detail.
When siRNAs from such a source reached 12% or more of the total miRNA reads there was a 10%
reduction in the first synthesized miR122 isoform (but not the other miRNAs) and this induced acute liver
toxicity exemplified by elevated liver enzymes and in some cases liver failure and death. Because germline
knockout of miR122 has a much lesser phenotype, we hypothesize the discordance in these outcomes is
related to the differential expression of the miR122 precursor RNA transcript known as long-non-coding
RNA 122 (lnc122) and that these two RNAs have separate but coordinated functions. We propose to
elucidate the molecular function of nuclear localized lnc122 RNA and by removing lnc122 and miR122
RNAs and then reintroducing the different individual RNA components in cells, mouse liver and
hepatocellular carcinoma models. This will allow us to separate the individual functions of the RNA
products. We will also map the lnc122 chromatin interactions.
These studies are important because not only does the miR122/lnc122 gene have a tumor suppressor
function, but it is also known to have effects on normal liver regeneration, formation of hepatocellular
carcinoma, and liver fibrosis associated with various liver diseases such as NASH, lipid metabolism, and
viral hepatitis infection. Newer strategies to target gene transfer/expression outside the liver contain
transgenes with miR122 targets in the 3'UTR to exclude leaky expression in hepatocytes. This like some of
the antisense miR122 products tested in clinical trials, and hepatitis virus B and infections result in the
sponging of miR122 and the long-term effects of this are unclear. At the end of the granting period, we will
have a better understanding of the function of the various RNA products produced from the lnc122-miR122
locus and their role in cellular homeostasis and how this may effectively limit RNAi based therapeutics.
Moreover, as we learn more about the function of this genetic locus it will provide more insights into how it
participates in the disease processes noted. This may provide new insights into more optimal means to
treat patients with a variety of genetic and acquired diseases."
10893939,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Trichomonas vaginalis viruses (TVVs) are double stranded RNA viruses that persist in the obligate human
parasite Trichomonas vaginalis (Tvag). Tvag is the causative agent of the human disease trichomoniasis, the
most common nonviral sexually transmitted infection worldwide. Infection with TVV-containing parasites is
thought to increase the severity of this disease and its complications by increasing the pro-inflammatory
response by the human superhost. There are five known species in genus Trichomonasvirus (TVV1, TVV2,
TVV3, TVV4, and TVV5), but most experiments to date have been performed using purified TVV1 virions or
TVV1-containing isolates, due in part to the greater availability of Tvag isolates singly infected with TVV1. TVVs
do not have an extracellular lifecycle and instead are transmitted vertically as the parasite divides. Further,
multiple TVV species can coinfect a singular trichomonad. Thus, studying the effect of TVVs on the parasite and
the human superhost has been difficult, as uninfected trichomonads cannot be infected to create isogenic TVV+
vs. TVV- strains. Using the nucleoside analog 2’-C-methylcytidine (2CMC), which has been recently reported to
clear trichomonads of TVV-infection, we have generated isogenic pairs of cured and uncured strains generated
from the same parent isolate. With these isogenic pairs, we propose to test our hypothesis that T. vaginalis
maintains a persistent viral infection, which confers a fitness advantage to the protozoan and increases
virulence to the human superhost. Thus far, we have performed high throughput RNA-sequencing with one
such isogenic pair to measure differential gene expression. In doing so, we have identified several candidate
genes that may be involved in limiting viral replication to tolerable levels in order to maintain long-term viral
persistence. These differentially expressed genes have largely not been characterized, but some encode factors
with homology to known RNA exonucleases and helicases, which we hypothesize might be involved in limiting
viral replication. In Aim 1 of this project, we propose to further validate these results in additional isogenic pairs
in order to define factors Tvag uses to maintain a stable trichomonasvirus infection. In Aim 2, we propose to
determine impacts of TVV infection on Tvag proliferation, morphology, and adherence to human cells. We
hypothesize that TVVs will increase parasite survival and attachment, providing an evolutionary explanation for
long-term TVV persistence. Finally, in Aim 3, we propose to compare responses of human cells to infection with
TVV+ and TVV- trichomonads across TVV species. We anticipate that TVV+ Tvag strains, regardless of virus
species, will elicit stronger inflammatory responses than TVV- strains. Through this work, we hope to uncover
valuable information about an important human pathogen and an intriguing model system to study virus–host
interactions."

With widespread public concern about the increasing presence of smartphone and social media (SSM)
technologies in the lives of American youth,1–3 there is a conspicuous need for investment in rigorous scientific
work that will inform our understanding of the psychological precursors of SSM habits, and on the impacts that
these habits may have on subsequent development and everyday functioning. While a foundational literature is
starting to form, research on the origins and outcomes of SSM habits remains skeletal, and two basic
questions are still unanswered: 1) Are the correlates of digital media habits stable across development, or do
they vary with age? 2) In what direction do these relationships ensue – do observed correlations reflect
individual differences that presage subsequent variation in SSM habit formation/intensity, or, do they reflect the
impacts of SSM habits on consequent brain/psychological development and everyday functioning? The
present study aims to refine our answers to these key questions through a multi-methodological (behavior,
neuroimaging, self-reports, ecological momentary assessment) cross-sequential investigation of the individual
differences factors that prospectively predict SSM habit formation and of the outcomes associated with
intensification of such habits across development. Through an initial cross-sectional assay of children,
adolescents, and young adults, we will investigate whether the relations between psychological/brain
functioning and SSM behaviors vary as a function of age. In a subsequent longitudinal phase, we will
concurrently track trajectories of psychological/brain maturation, everyday functioning (e.g., academic
outcomes, psychological and physical wellbeing), and SSM engagement, in order to shed light on the temporal
chain of processes linking mental functioning and SSM usage. Our investigative team is extremely well
positioned to execute the proposed research, which will draw heavily from the theoretical framing and methods that
have propelled our previous work, and which will recruit from active developmental cohorts who have participated in
related recent studies implemented in our labs. Based on guiding neurodevelopmental theories, we hypothesize
that individual differences in self-regulatory control, reward and sensation seeking, reactivity to social inputs,
and risk-taking propensity will be differentially predictive of usage patterns at varying points in development,
and that these relationships will be shown to have bidirectional interactions with intensifying SSM behaviors,
with important implications for everyday functioning."
10892928,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 To protect the host and perform their symbiotic role, intestinal epithelial cells secrete large amounts of
highly glycosylated mucin to physically distance yet provide bacteria habitat and fuel, while establishing apical
junction complexes that regulate nutrient and waste flux. In return, a healthy microbiota functions to provide
metabolites the epithelium relies on for function. We recently published that the purine hypoxanthine (Hpx) is a
microbiota-derived metabolite that the mucosa depends upon for energy balance, barrier function, and wound
healing, suggesting Hpx as a limiting substrate for homeostatic mucosal metabolism and function. In unbiased
extensions of that work, we demonstrated that Hpx induces TP53-inducible glycolysis and apoptosis regulator
(TIGAR) expression and activates AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) in vitro and in vivo. TIGAR increases
metabolite flux through the pentose phosphate pathway while AMPK is a master regulator of metabolism that
promotes energy balance. We hypothesize that Hpx fundamentally molds epithelial metabolism through TIGAR
and AMPK as mechanisms that support intestinal homeostasis and wound healing. In this, purine depletion
and reconstitution by colonization experiments with a developed mutant E. coli enriched in Hpx production will
be employed to determine the influence of microbiota-derived Hpx on mucosal energy metabolism, barrier
function, and wound healing.
 The applicant, Dr. Lee, has established a scientific niche in which to build a foundation for independent
research in the role of microbiota-derived purines in gut mucosal energy metabolism and function. Dr. Lee and
his mentor, Dr. Colgan, assembled an advisory committee to regularly meet as a group with Dr. Lee throughout
the duration of the award to provide feedback on the research, critique the research plans, monitor
publications, and provide career advice. Drs. Colgan and Lee also identified microbiology and immunology
courses to facilitate expansion of Dr. Lee's foundation of knowledge in fundamental intestinal processes, and
established tutelage in colonic enteroid harvesting/culturing for study and in histopathological analyses. Dr. Lee
will submit his work to present at conferences specific to his research to share his research and network with
colleagues and potential collaborators, and get valuable feedback from the scientific community. Dr. Lee's
development will benefit from continued participation in the Mucosal Inflammation Program (MIP), a multi-
disciplinary, multi-departmental program initiated to study mechanisms of mucosal inflammation and resolution.
The MIP fosters a unique lab environment for collaboration between physician scientists, clinicians, and
research scientists, and works to establish an environment for young investigators to flourish and develop. The
facilities and resources available to and development plan built for Dr. Lee provide an ideal environment and
path for his successful transition to independence."

The Gulf South Minority/Underserved – NCORP (GS-M/U-NCORP) and the Ochsner-Community-NCORP, the
two NCORPs in Louisiana, have both met the objectives proposed for the last funding cycle, expanding access
to and significantly increasing the number of patients participating in clinical trials in Louisiana and the Gulf
South region. These successful NCORPs have agreed to come together to form the Gulf South
Minority/Underserved Clinical Trials Network (Gulf South M/U CTN) NCORP, which will have as its primary
affiliates the LSU – Cancer Center New Orleans (LSU-CC-New Orleans), LSU – Feist Weiller Cancer Center
Shreveport (LSU-FWCC-Shreveport), Mary Bird Perkins Cancer Center (MBPCC) and the Ochsner-Cancer
Center (Ochsner). The new Gulf South M/U CTN will provide cancer care and access to clinical trials for >50%
of new cancer cases in the region, expand the number of sites offering access to clinical trials from 22 to 42,
and exceed the required 30% proportion of minority patients participating in NCORP trials. The Gulf South
M/U CTN will bring additional resources including the Louisiana Tumor SEER registry (LTR-SEER) and the
state-wide cancer screening programs such as the Louisiana Breast and Cervical Health Program (LBCHP),
and the Louisiana Comprehensive Cancer Control Program (LCCCP). In addition we will benefit from ongoing
research led by our investigators and aimed at understanding cancer inequities and disparities in our region.
The new Gulf South M/U CTN has also expanded its network with major health providers in the region
including the Veterans Administration Hospital (New Orleans), Woman's Hospital (the largest dedicated clinical
center for women's health) in Baton Rouge and the Christus Health community sites. The new Gulf South M/U
CTN has garnered the support of the Louisiana Department of Health Secretary and the Governor, who are
developing a cancer care plan for the state (Taking Aim at Cancer in Louisiana Collaborative -TACL), where
the Gulf South M/U CTN is the major provider of state-wide cancer clinical trials. This support will help us to
continue increasing the participation of patients in NCORP and non-NCORP studies. To achieve our goals we
will implement the following three strategies. 1. Expand the number of sites through additional partnerships
with community organizations such as FQHC's where we will test novel approaches to increase the
participation of community physicians providing care to cancer patients in the region; 2. Support the
development of CCDR and Health Disparities research initiated by our investigators to understand the
inequities created by cancer in our region and 3. Increase our participation in national trials supported by
NCORP and other organizations to expand the scope and depth of trials offered to our patients."
10890137,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is no specific treatment available for the subpopulation of patients with salt sensitivity of blood pressure
(BP); unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms underlying salt-sensitivity remain poorly understood. One of the
major proposed mechanisms for the development of salt-sensitive (SS) hypertension involves a defect in the
ability of the kidneys to excrete salt. Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP) encoded by Nppa, is a hormone known to
promote salt excretion and BP reduction, and there are clinical data implicating inherently low levels of ANP in
the development of SS hypertension. Among other effects, ANP (via cGMP-related mechanisms) is known to be
beneficial for mitochondrial bioenergetics and biogenesis. However, there is a gap in knowledge regarding the
effects of ANP on mitochondria in the kidney, especially in SS hypertension. Our pilot studies demonstrated
that during a high salt challenge Nppa-/- (ANP knockout) Dahl SS rats exhibit exacerbated salt-sensitivity,
reduced sodium excretion, and aggravated kidney injury, which is associated with mitochondrial damage and
dysfunction. We also showed that there is dysregulation of renal sodium transporters, in the Nppa-/- rats
compared to wild-type controls, and the activity of the Epithelial Na+ Channel (ENaC) is elevated in the collecting
ducts. Chronic ANP infusion in wild-type SS rats resulted in a dramatic attenuation of salt-induced BP increase
and alleviated organ damage.
We hypothesize that in SS hypertension ANP deficiency/reduced sensitivity to ANP is causative to renal
mitochondrial dysfunction and associated sodium transport imbalance. To address the central hypothesis of this
project, we developed three specific aims: Aim 1. Establish whether increased ANP levels are beneficial for
renal salt handling and cardiac function in SS hypertension. Aim 2. Determine whether low renal cGMP level
resulting from lack of ANP causes an increase in renal mitochondrial Ca2+ and reactive oxygen species (ROS).
Aim 3. Test the hypothesis that disrupted Ca2+ balance and excessive ROS production by dysfunctional
mitochondria affect renal sodium handling in SS hypertension.
We generated abundant evidence to support these aims, created a rigorous and comprehensive experimental
design and established novel cutting-edge techniques to address the hypothesis. We recruited strong
collaborative expertise, and will implement a combination of whole-animal studies and in vivo techniques (blood
pressure monitoring with drug infusion, metabolic studies and GFR measurements), electrophysiology (single
channel and whole-cell patch-clamp of the freshly isolated nephrons and isolated mitochondria), advanced
microscopy, mitochondrial spectrofluorimetry and respirometry, and routine molecular biology approaches. The
successful completion of the proposed studies will unravel the novel causative mechanisms of salt-sensitivity."

The striatum is an evolutionarily conserved structure involved in cognitive and limbic regulation of motor
control. Striatal circuits are implicated in the initiation and execution of ethologically relevant motor output,
ranging from exploratory actions to highly stereotyped motor patterns. Dysfunction of these circuits leads to
motor control abnormalities that frequently manifest as excessive repetitive behaviors. Self-directed grooming,
a highly stereotyped repetitive motor pattern, is observed in virtually all animals, serving vital functions in
hygiene maintenance, thermoregulation, de-arousal, stress reduction, and social communication. Abnormally
repetitive grooming is a central behavioral phenotype observed in numerous models for neurological and
neuropsychiatric diseases. A better understanding of the neural control of grooming may thus yield
fundamental insights into how the brain controls repetitive motor output in both normal and diseased
conditions. Our preliminary work suggests that an understudied population of interneurons within the olfactory
tubercle (OT; the most ventral part of the striatum), predominantly in the Islands of Calleja (IC), is involved in
mediating this behavior. The striatum has a fairly uniform cellular composition, with ~95% of the neurons being
spiny projection neurons (SPNs), classified as D1- or D2-type according to the dopamine receptors they
express. One exception to this uniformity is the existence of evolutionarily conserved IC, clusters of densely-
packed, GABAergic granule cells, which express the D3 dopamine receptor. By means of optogenetic
manipulations, we have shown that activation of OT D3 neurons initiates robust grooming behavior via arrest of
other alternative ongoing behaviors. In contrast, inactivation of these neurons halts ongoing grooming. These
findings lead to the central hypothesis that OT D3 neurons play critical roles in controlling grooming behavior.
Through an array of modern neuroscience approaches (optogenetics, ex vivo and in vivo electrophysiology,
fiber photometry, neural circuit tracing, and behavior), we will pursue three specific aims to determine (1) in
vivo activity patterns of OT D3 neurons and SPNs in grooming and other behaviors, (2) contributions of OT D3
neurons to grooming in relation to other brain regions, and (3) the effects of dopamine release into the OT on
grooming behavior. Overall, this project will provide insights into the neural circuitry of the IC/OT D3 neurons
and its role in neurobiological control of a highly important motor pattern."
10892881,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Social insects show robust and complex behaviors, and have served as important study systems in ethology
for decades. However, because they are not genetically tractable, researchers have not been able to study
these behaviors at the level of brain circuitry with cutting-edge neurogenetic tools. The proposed work will
pioneer such tools in the clonal raider ant Ooceraea biroi, a species that uniquely combines experimental
amenability with the fascinating behavior of social insects. It will then address an important biological question:
how does variation in neural responsiveness give rise to consistent differences in how individuals respond to
social and environmental stimuli? O. biroi is particularly suitable to study this question for a number of reasons.
First, the ants reproduce asexually and clonally, implying that behavioral differences arise from phenotypic
plasticity, rather than genetic differences. Second, unlike in conventional model systems like Drosophila or
mice, differences in behavioral propensities are adaptive because they give rise to stable division of labor in a
colony context. Accordingly, these differences are robust and predictable, and they have received a lot of
theoretical and empirical attention at the behavioral level. Given that ants communicate almost exclusively via
pheromones, we will focus on the antennal lobe, the primary processing area of chemosensory information in
the insect brain, analogous to the mammalian olfactory bulb. In Aim 1, we will generate transgenic lines
expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP in the antennal lobe to enable live imaging of
neural activity with two-photon microscopy. We will also generate lines expressing the photoactivatable
fluorescent protein CaMPARI2, enabling stable labeling of neurons active in freely behaving animals. In Aim 2,
we will use these tools to create a functionally annotated map of chemosensory representation in the ant
antennal lobe. We will also use single-cell RNA-sequencing of labelled neurons to identify odorant receptors
responding to pheromones. We will then use the promoters of these receptors to generate additional, narrowly
targeted transgenic lines. In Aim 3, we will study how differences in neural representation and sensitivity
correlate with plastic differences in behavioral responses to identical social stimuli. Based on these data, we
will build a predictive theoretical model of division of labor in insect societies. On a fundamental level, our
results on the modulation of sensory perception will also inform our understanding of human disorders
involving abnormal sensory sensitivity, such as autism and schizophrenia. Finally, we will make the tools and
protocols developed under this proposal available to the scientific community, greatly advancing the field of
social insect neuroscience and opening up a vast new experimental space. The robust and expansive
behavioral repertoire of social insects combined with the simplicity of a compact invertebrate nervous system
allows O. biroi to fill an important niche in neuroscience."
10877925,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Acinetobacter baumannii is among the most antibiotic-resistant pathogens known, and the
emergence of isolates with enhanced virulence poses an urgent public health challenge. Understanding
how the microorganism thwarts antibiotic and immune attack via its protective cell envelope is essential to
developing new strategies for controlling this threat. Envelope synthesis and integrity in bacteria are
typically maintained by a large number of response systems that control specific aspects of the envelope. A.
baumannii, however, has diverged substantially from this paradigm. The pathogen lacks orthologs of many
canonical envelope response proteins and instead relies on a single two-protein regulatory system to
globally modulate every layer of the envelope and control both antibiotic resistance and ability to
cause disease. This unique system, known as BfmRS, lowers susceptibility to a wide range of drugs,
antagonizes innate immune killing, and facilitates development of lethal disease in mice. Intriguingly, a
clinical isolate showing enhanced virulence requires the system for growth. BfmRS is therefore tightly linked
to the intractability of infections with the pathogen and represents a key potential therapeutic target. Despite
its fundamental importance, we lack an understanding of how the large BfmRS regulon controls broad-
range drug resistance and pathogenicity, and what signals the system senses. The objective of the
proposed studies is to understand how A. baumannii uses a single control circuit to simultaneously
modulate resistance and virulence. Our central hypothesis is that BfmRS jointly controls the barrier to both
drug penetration and innate immune attack by modulating the level of key outer membrane (OM) structures
in response to disruptions in envelope protein production. We will test this hypothesis by pursuing three
Aims, which build on our extensive preliminary data defining the BfmRS regulon and its chemical-genetic
profile, as well as the phosphorylation cascade it uses for signaling. In Aim 1 we will test the model that
BfmRS controls the bacterial interface with both antibiotics and innate immune effectors by modulating the
OM barrier. In Aim 2, we will identify the antibiotic-induced and intrinsic stress signals that are sensed by
BfmRS. In Aim 3, we will define the relationship between variability in BfmRS activity, growth-dependence,
and virulence across diverse patient isolates as a test of the model that variation in BfmRS signaling level is
a driver of enhanced virulence in invasive strains. This work will elucidate the mechanisms by which a
unique regulatory system controls both resistance and pathogenicity in a critically important nosocomial
microbe. These results will inform strategies for potentiating antibiotic and immune action for killing
extensively drug-resistant bacteria."
10862552,"Background: Successful deployment of strategies to reduce unnecessary testing and treatment is a critical
component of improving care and minimizing harms. The Choosing Wisely Initiative has highlighted the
importance of safely and effectively de-implementing unnecessary testing and treating practices. Positive urine
cultures are a major driver of inappropriate antimicrobial use. Asymptomatic patients are often screened and
positive urine cultures treated, despite new guidelines from national societies that patients without symptoms of
urinary tract infection (UTI) should not have a urine culture performed and should not be treated with antibiotics
even if the culture is positive. This inappropriate use of antibiotics can lead to preventable patient harms (e.g.,
C. difficile infection, antibiotic resistance) without any benefit. This proposal will develop and test a de-
implementation strategy for reducing screening and treatment of urine cultures in asymptomatic surgical
patients.
Specific Aims: Aim 1: Develop a live database of the 15-facility CDC-CREATE Network to identify and to
track organizational, provider, and patient level factors associated with preoperative urine testing and ASB
treatment. Aim 2: Determine the current context of pre-operative urine testing and treating, and barriers and
facilitators to de-implementation, using in-depth interviews at 5 facilities in our CDC-CREATE network. Aim 3:
Develop a de-implementation tool and randomly select 5 intervention sites for pilot testing and compare rates
of urine testing in 5 randomly selected control sites using time series analysis.
Significance: This proposal meets the HSR&D Implementation Science priority area that addresses provider
behavior and Secretary Shulkin's Priority 3: Focus Resources More Efficiently. It also addresses the Infectious
Diseases Society of America #1 Choosing Wisely recommendation which says, “Don't treat asymptomatic
bacteriuria with antibiotics.” The impact on Veteran's healthcare will be to focus resources towards evidence
based practices that are associated with benefits (surgical prevention checklist) and away from potentially
harmful practices (urine testing and treatment in asymptomatic patients). This innovative approach will
translate new guidelines - to do less - into action using a theory based multi-pronged intervention.
Methods: We will partner with the De-implementation Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (QUERI) and
adapt their conceptual framework to achieve the proposal objectives. In addition, we will utilize our existing
partnership with the CDC-CREATE network of sites to evaluate the context, facilitators and barriers to stopping
urine culture practices in asymptomatic surgical patients and to pilot test a de-implementation strategy. We will
use a mixed-methods approach, including analyses of data from the national VA databases (e.g. Corporate
Data Warehouse), qualitative interviews, and piloting of a de-implementation strategy with a goal of wider
dissemination in future work. We anticipate that the de-implementation strategy created and tested in this study
will reduce urine testing and treatment in asymptomatic surgical patients.
Implications and Next Steps: Our study will provide important insights into patient, provider, and hospital
level factors, as well as organizational culture and broader external context (e.g., professional, social)
associated with unnecessary urine testing and antibiotic treatment of surgical patients. Our study will develop a
strategy to provide reliable, relevant data to the providers so they can do a critical assessment of the evidence
against urine testing (unlearning) and adopt a substitute process to optimize the success of our de-
implementation goal. Our next steps will be to test the intervention in a wider array of facilities and to work with
the Antimicrobial Stewardship Task Force to disseminate our findings to VA antimicrobial stewardship teams
nationwide. Our future goals are to disseminate the strategy nationally and to expand it to other patient
settings, such as acute care and community living centers."

 Minorities comprise 50% of US children, but only 24% of US pediatricians, and underrepresented minorities
(URMs) make up only 11% of pediatricians and 10% of medical-school faculty. Despite this substantial
mismatch, little has been published on research educational programs (REPs) efficacious in recruiting and
retaining diverse individuals pursuing biomedical, behavioral, clinical, or social-science careers. The Academic
Pediatric Association (APA) Research in Academic Pediatrics Initiative on Diversity (RAPID) is the first such
REP targeting faculty diversity in general academic pediatrics, and funding is requested for another 5 years.
 The RAPID aim is to implement and evaluate an REP with the goal of successful recruitment, retention,
and professional advancement of diverse junior faculty in general academic pediatrics pursuing careers in
NIDDK mission areas. RAPID has several innovative components: 1) small research grants in NIDDK mission
areas; 2) pairing RAPID scholars with national mentors who are accomplished senior investigators and
seasoned mentors; 3) in-person mentoring and networking at an annual meeting at the Pediatric Academic
Societies meeting; 4) an annual career-development and leadership conference; and 5) monthly Scholar
telephone conference calls, to provide intensive mentoring, peer support, peer mentoring, networking, a venue
for presenting research in progress, and opportunities for potential research collaborations. APA has extensive
available educational resources, experience, staff, and facilities, all of which will continue to ensure the
success of RAPID. The first 10 years of RAPID were highly successful, with the program achieving or
exceeding all original aims, including: 1) APA membership diversity significantly increasing; 2) multiple
Scholars obtaining K awards and R01s; 3) Scholars generating multiple publications and presentations at
national conferences; 4) continuing a highly rated annual conference of URM investigators from across the US
spanning the spectrum from residents to mid-level faculty; and 5) convening an annual networking meeting of
Scholars, National Advisory Committee members, and RAPID and APA leadership. RAPID's success as a
model REP also impacted the entire field of pediatrics by prompting new partnerships with the Pediatric
Infectious Diseases Society, American Board of Pediatrics, and American Pediatric Society, all of which have
welcomed or will welcome new RAPID Scholars funded by their organizations.
 If, as anticipated, the hypotheses continue to be confirmed, RAPID will continue to result in: 1) successful
recruitment, retention, and professional advancement of diverse junior faculty researchers; 2) increased
likelihood that RAPID Scholars will present their project findings at a national professional meeting, publish
their project findings, obtain additional research funding, obtain a career-development award, maintain their
APA membership, and highly rate their commitment to a research career in pediatric academic generalism;
and 3) a model societal program for enhancing the diversity of young investigators and their leadership skills."

Symptomatic Osteoarthritis (OA) affects over 32.5 million individuals in the U.S. and is a leading cause of disability and increasing medical costs. Toxicities associated with drug therapies for knee OA pain have caused the number of recommended treatments to decrease over time. There is now a critical shortage of treatment options for people with knee OA, especially because comorbidities that complicate treatment selection are highly prevalent in this older adult population.
Tai Chi, a multi-dimensional practice that integrates physical, psychosocial, and behavioral components, has exhibited clinically significant improvements in chronic knee OA pain conditions. The American College of Rheumatology clinical practice guidelines strongly recommend Tai Chi as an intervention for knee OA. Recent studies conducted during the pandemic suggest that remotely delivered Tai Chi is a promising and scalable strategy for knee OA pain. However, critical gaps remain as to the real-world effectiveness of remote Tai Chi for knee OA and its implementation across multiple Health Care Systems. 
We propose an embedded, pragmatic, randomized trial that will compare the effects of a 3-month twice weekly remotely delivered web-based Tai Chi intervention versus routine care across four Health Care Systems (Tufts Medical Center, Boston Medical Center, University of California Los Angeles Health, and Cleveland Clinic Ohio and Cleveland Clinic Florida) in four geographic regions (Eastern Massachusetts, Southern California, Northeast Ohio, Southern Florida). We will enroll 480 patients with a clinical diagnosis of knee OA. Participants will be evaluated at baseline and 3 months, with additional follow-up at 6 and 12 months. We hypothesize that implementation of remotely delivered Tai Chi is feasible across four Health Care Systems and that Tai Chi, compared to Routine Care, will improve physical health (including knee-related pain and function) and mental health as well as healthcare utilization.  
Our innovative study is the first rigorous multi-site pragmatic trial of a remote Tai Chi, in the multiple Health Care Systems utilizing web-based technology. It is designed to improve patient centered outcomes of knee OA. The results will enable widespread adoption of mind-body approaches for knee OA across Health Care Systems and lay the groundwork for future trials comparing the effectiveness of different implementation strategies."
10851968,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Formation of the head and face is a complex process that is highly susceptible to disturbance as evidenced by
the high incidence of craniofacial birth defects. Dysregulation in genetic and environmental factors are the main
causes of craniofacial defects. However, less than 50% of craniofacial defect cases have identified genetic
causes, and mechanisms of gene-environment interaction remains poorly understood. Therefore, molecular
investigation is needed to increase understanding of craniofacial development. We recently identified a new
regulator of craniofacial morphogenesis that interacts with environmental stress. This regulator, Protein
Arginine Methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1), is an enzyme that methylates histone to generate a transcriptional
activation mark H4R3me2a and methylation non-histone proteins on arginine residues. Prmt1 ablation in
neural crest cells caused cleft palate and skull malformation. We further uncovered a role for PRMT1 in
guarding against environmental toxin TCDD-induced cleft palate. In this proposal, we aim to determine
PRMT1-dependent transcription and epigenetic mechanisms that regulated TCDD-induced cellular changes
and developmental defects, using mouse genetic models, biochemical and cell biology approaches, RNA-seq,
ChIP-seq and bioinformatic analysis."

Exposure to mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and repetitive head impacts (RHI) during sport participation has
been associated with adverse long-term consequences (e.g., cognitive decline). Research investigating these
associations has been limited to cross-sectional studies at single points of the lifespan without consideration of
factors that can influence these associations. Greater mTBI/RHI history is associated with cerebral blood flow
(CBF) and white matter (WM) abnormalities, even within younger athletes. CBF and WM abnormalities are two
indicators of pathological aging and longitudinal decline in the general population. Age and cardiovascular risk
factors across the lifespan can influence these abnormalities. The scientific objective of this proposal is to
determine the influence of mTBI/RHI on MRI metrics of pathological aging and neurobehavioral function across
the lifespan. Our central hypothesis is that mTBI/RHI will be associated with neurobehavioral function and
CBF/WM abnormalities, and that the strength of this association is independently influenced by increasing age
and the presence of cardiovascular risk factors. The rationale for this project is that determining the influence
of mTBI/RHI on MRI metrics of pathological aging and neurobehavioral function across the lifespan, as well as
factors that influence this relationship, will provide insight into the process underlying cumulative head injury
and neurological decline later in life. Our hypothesis will be tested with two specific and one exploratory aims:
1) Determine the associations between mTBI/RHI and neurobehavioral function across the lifespan and the
influence of comorbid cardiovascular risk factors; 2) Determine the associations between mTBI/RHI and MRI
metrics of pathological aging across the lifespan and the influence of comorbid cardiovascular risk factors;
Exploratory) Examine if MRI metrics of pathological aging mediate the association between cumulative
mTBI/RHI and neurobehavioral function across the lifespan. To establish an independent research program
that identifies the mechanisms by which mTBI/RHI can result in long-term neurological disease burden, the
training objective of this proposal is to receive expert training/mentorship in a) the analysis and interpretation of
neuroimaging data, b) the cumulative effects of aging and cardiovascular risk factors on long-term brain health
and function, and c) the molecular mechanisms and progression of neuropathology as a consequence of
mTBI/RHI. We will employ an innovative lifespan approach by leveraging data from four large-scale,
prospective, multi-center studies of athletes across several decades of life. Harmonization of several mentor-
directed, large-scale multisite datasets of athletes will allow a hybrid prospective, cross-sectional design. We
will utilize advanced analytical approaches to examine the potential influence of aging and comorbid
cardiovascular risk factors on the associations between mTBI/RHI with MRI metrics of pathological aging and
long-term neurobehavioral changes. This work is significant in that it will inform methods for identifying those at
risk for decline, improve risk estimates of long-term outcomes, and inform therapeutic targets for intervention."
10888310,"Project Summary/Abstract
The advent of molecular biomarkers holds great promise, both from a diagnostic perspective as well as the ability
to predict a disease state early enough to inform therapy and change clinical outcomes. In the last several years,
studies have suggested a role for biomarker profiling in the management of immunosuppression in liver
transplant recipients. From our CTOT-14 study data, we have developed key biomarkers that can detect early
signs of under- (rejection) and over- (chronic kidney disease) immunosuppression, particularly with use of
standard calcineurin-inhibitor therapy. But as the accuracy of molecular diagnostics improves, and as technology
platforms evolve, two important questions have surfaced regarding their value in the management of liver
transplant recipients. First, can biomarkers inform patient management and optimize the ability to personalize
immunosuppressive therapy? Second, can we characterize key pathways of immune activation and kidney injury
to further optimize the use of biomarkers and identify new therapeutic targets? We believe that these questions
comprise the next frontier in biomarker research, and we have therefore formulated this proposal to test a set of
hypotheses that relate directly to these questions. First, in a prospective multi-center clinical trial of liver
transplant recipients, we will challenge the `standard of care' and test the hypothesis that serial blood biomarker
profiling can identify patients at risk of kidney injury after liver transplantation and also guide the removal of
nephrotoxic calcineurin-inhibitor therapy safely without adversely increasing acute rejection. To achieve this
objective, we will leverage these immune and kidney biomarkers developed in our CTOT-14 validation study to
detect early signs of rejection and kidney injury to enhance proactive, safe withdrawal of calcineurin-inhibitors in
favor of non-nephrotoxic mTOR-inhibitors. This biomarker-guided interventional approach will be tested against
current standard management and also risk-stratify patients into those needing or not needing such
interventions. Second, we will leverage the clinical trial sample collections to gain deeper understanding of what
leads to rejection or alternatively what is protective of rejection. We will accomplish this by performing an
extensive battery of blood immune cell, antibody, genomic and proteomic profiling during the interventions to
best identify the pathways leading to our outcomes. In addition, we will simultaneously perform novel kidney
imaging biomarkers to ask what leads to kidney injury vs. protection in our unique cohorts. Together, the clinical
trial and accompanying mechanistic studies will allow us to cross the next frontier in biomarker research in
transplantation, namely the ability to use biomarkers to monitor the state of immune responsiveness and drug
toxicity to inform therapeutic decisions. Our clinical data and bio-banked samples will create a new resource for
the community and facilitate a new generation of molecular diagnostics translatable into clinical practice."
10887615,"No anti-thrombotic agent (ATA) is safe and effective in the many patients at a combined risk of
acute thrombosis and bleeding, e.g., in the early post-surgery period. To address this unmet need, we
develop drug delivery systems (DDS) executing two main functions: A) Block access of ATA to off-
target sites, e.g., hemostatic plugs formed after surgery, while B) Optimize pharmacokinetics and
deliver ATA into subsequent thrombi, where ATA is activated by thrombin. ATA fused with single-
chain fragments (scFv) targeted to red blood cells (RBC) bind to these carriers that execute dual
blocking/delivering function. Proof-of-concept is emerging in models of pre-existing and nascent clots
in animals. Here we devise humanized scFv/ATA targeted to human RBC and will test them in a
humanized microfluidic system (HMF), in transgenic (TG) mice expressing humanized target epitopes
on blood cells, and in the perfusion of isolated human lungs. We will pursue three aims. Aim 1. RBC
loading. We will characterize scFv/ATA loading onto RBC: A) Binding (copies/cell, on/off kinetics); B)
Effect on RBC functionality, biocompatibility and biomechanics; and, B) Regulation of distribution of
scFv/ATA between RBC in circulation. We also will characterize biomechanical factors modulating
RBC/ATA delivery and effect on clot dynamics and structure, in particular, impact of RBC
rigidification, caused by either drug loading or by intrinsic pathophysiological changes in patient's
blood. Aim 2. Mechanistic insights. We will interrogate previously unrecognized yet critically
aspects of the RBC/ATA workings, in particular their interaction with vascular endothelium and
transfer of the drug cargo to these and other vascular cells. In this Aim we will use standard mouse in
vivo models, microfluidic model and perfusion of isolated human lungs model. Aim 3. Appraisal of
benefit/risk ratio. We are developing TM mice expressing human RBC determinants in mouse EBC,
in order to study scFv/ATA loaded on ""human RBC"" in vivo: A) PK/BD, complement activation,
phagocyte uptake and vascular adhesion of RBC/ATA in TG mice; B) Define the time window/extent
of anti-thrombotic effect of human RBC/ATA in models of arterial vs venous thrombosis in TG mice;
B) Affirm the safety of RBC/ATA. We will detect adversities of scFv/ATA including abnormalities of
RBC. To defuse potential issues, if necessary, we will use more benign loading regimen. Together,
these studies will advance mechanistic insights and clinical translation of a novel way to mitigate
thrombosis in currently unprotected patients by providing a new and tractable approach to
understanding thrombus development and a rational approach to deliver cell-directed therapeutics"
10870198,"ABSTRACT
Autonomic remodeling is a major contributor to the initiation and maintenance of lethal ventricular arrhythmias.
Following myocardial infarction (MI), sympathetic drive is increased and parasympathetic tone is reduced.
There is also structural and functional remodeling of the cardiac sympathetic nerves, including regional
denervation, and altered neuropeptide and neurotransmitter content. Due to the intimate relationship between
cardiomyocytes and neurons, any change in nerve activity brings about adaptive changes in nearby cardio-
myocytes. These changes are in addition to ischemia-driven electrophysiological and structural remodeling.
The combined effects of post-MI autonomic, electrophysiological, and structural remodeling are critically
important but not well understood, in part because investigating the role of the autonomic nervous system in
contributing to emergent cardiac arrhythmias in the complex MI setting requires integrative, multi-scale and
multi-organ approaches. Using novel methodologies developed in our lab, our goal is to determine cardiac
signaling responses to normal and pathological autonomic activity, how this activity provokes arrhythmias in
the post-MI heart, and the anti-arrhythmic effects of restoring nerve structure or function. We have recently
developed a novel whole-heart multi-parametric optical imaging system capable of high-sensitivity fluor-
escence resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging of cardiomyocyte signaling activity in parallel with high-
speed optical mapping of resulting electrophysiological responses in the intact heart. We have also generated
a novel cardiomyocyte-specific cyclic AMP (cAMP) reporter mouse with a large dynamic range. We will
combine these new tools with our established innervated heart approach and pharmacological and electrical
neuromodulation to precisely connect physiological autonomic activity, cardiomyocyte signaling responses,
and resulting arrhythmogenic behavior. Aim 1 will focus on how gradients in nerve density drive the spatio-
temporal kinetics of cAMP responses throughout the heart, the effective doses of neurotransmitters required to
produce nerve-evoked responses, and how cAMP activity is transduced into functional Vm and Cai changes.
Aim 2 will discern cellular mechanisms responsible for denervation super-sensitivity, and the role of nerve
structure vs. function in driving adrenergic responsiveness. Aim 3 will determine the mechanisms and anti-
arrhythmic effects of post-MI neuromodulatory therapies. These studies will provide unprecedented insight into
how autonomic dysfunction contributes to post-MI arrhythmias from cellular signaling up to macro-scale multi-
organ interactions."
11031059,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Thirty years of follow up data from two landmark trials (DCCT/EDIC) demonstrates that intensive insulin
management to achieve near-normal blood glucose levels decreases the risk of retinopathy, neuropathy, and
nephropathy for individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D).1,2 Yet, achieving near-normal blood glucose levels
increases the risk of severe hypoglycemia in those with T1D by 3-fold. Currently, there are no specific dietary
recommendations from the American Diabetes Association for pediatric T1D;3 however, a growing number of
youth with T1D and their parents are interested in very low carbohydrate diets to improve blood glucose
control.4
There has been hesitance to prescribe such diets to adolescents as no rigorous studies have been
performed in this age group.
The goal of this proposal is to determine the safety and efficacy of a very low
carbohydrate diet in adolescents with T1D by looking at metabolic and neurological changes that occur with
this diet. Aim 1 of this proposal uses a randomized crossover study design to compare the time spent in the
target range using continuous glucose monitors when adolescents with T1D follow a standard versus very low
carbohydrate diet. Less time in the hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic ranges indicates better safety. The
number of episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis and severe hypoglycemia will also be reported. Aim 2 will
compare the counterregulatory hormone response to hypoglycemia between the 2 diets using the 2-step
hyperinsulinemic euglycemic-hypoglycemic clamp technique.
Stable isotope infusions will be used to assess
rates of hepatic glucose production (glucose release from the liver) and
glycerol metabolism from adipose
tissue. Further, very low carbohydrate diets are likely to cause higher ketone levels in the blood (nutritional
ketosis), but there is little known about how this will affect awareness of hypoglycemia and other neurological
changes. Aim 3 will assess changes in symptoms of hypoglycemia using validated questionnaires during the
hypoglycemia portion of the
clamp, which will be correlated with fMRI findings.
Through this aim, we will
determine if the ketosis that develops in very low carbohydrate diets will blunt warning signs of hypoglycemia.
Dr. Nally has assembled a leadership team with a diverse skillset to guide her in this research. Dr. Nally's
primary mentor, Dr. William Tamborlane, has over 45 years of experience in pediatric T1D research and has
mentored 14 current physician scientist faculty at Yale. Dr. Raimund Herzog (co-mentor) has expertise in the
metabolic effects of hypoglycemia and ketosis on the brain and will guide Dr. Nally with these aspects of the
study. With expertise in pediatric T1D, continuous glucose monitoring and the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic-
hypoglycemic clamps, Dr. Jennifer Sherr (co-mentor) will ensure Dr. Nally has the skillset necessary to conduct
the studies proposed herein. Dr. Nally will gain expertise in sophisticated measures of glucose and fat
metabolism using isotope tracers and insulin clamp techniques, as well as skills in fMRI interpretation, and
complete coursework in biostatistics, advancing her goal to become an independent investigator."

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death for persons with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-
stage renal disease (ESRD). Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is an underappreciated cardiovascular complication
of kidney disease that affects up to 60% with ESRD, in whom PH increases the risk of mortality 3-fold. Despite its
high prevalence and morbidity in ESRD, the pathophysiology of PH remains poorly understood. The current
pathophysiologic paradigm emphasizes volume overload as the main cause of PH in ESRD, but volume removal
through dialysis resolves PH in only a fraction of cases. Dr. Edmonston’s long-term goal is to identify novel
pathophysiologic targets for PH in ESRD through rigorous prospective studies and investigate new therapies
tailored to these targets through efficient clinical trials. Based on published preliminary data in 4772 patients with
CKD-ESRD, >60% of PH cases had elevated pulmonary vascular resistance on right heart catheterization. This
increased pulmonary vascular resistance implicates mechanisms beyond volume overload which promote
pulmonary vasoconstriction and remodeling. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that volume-independent
changes in vascular biology caused by reduced kidney function and exacerbated by hemodialysis contribute to
PH in ESRD. Increased circulating levels of the vasoactive factors asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA) and
serotonin, which cause pulmonary vascular remodeling and vasoconstriction, may serve as pathogenic links
between reduced kidney function and PH. Hemodialysis further introduces putative risk factors for PH:
subclinical hemolysis caused by hemodialysis releases free hemoglobin (Hb) into circulation that scavenges
nitric oxide (NO); and recurrent intradialytic hypoxemia promotes PH through frequent episodes of hypoxia-
induced vasoconstriction. In a prospective study, this proposal will investigate the association of each of these
volume-independent factors with PH in 150 patients with ESRD receiving maintenance hemodialysis: Aim 1 will
investigate ADMA and serotonin as mechanisms of PH in ESRD; Aim 2 will establish subclinical hemolysis and
impaired hemoglobin scavenge as hemodialysis-associated mechanisms of PH in ESRD; Aim 3 will quantify the
extent of intra- and extradialytic hypoxemia and define its association with PH in ESRD. Supported by new
preliminary data for this resubmission, PH will be estimated by tricuspid regurgitant velocity (TRV) on
echocardiogram. A longitudinal subcohort of 50 patients found to have PH on initial assessment will determine
how changes in these risk factors associate with PH progression after 6 months (Aims 1-3). To discern the
contribution of hemodialysis above the influence of ESRD, this proposal will also enroll 10 patients with ESRD
undergoing peritoneal dialysis (Aims 1-3). Execution of these scientific aims and completion of the career
development activities of this proposal, along with experienced mentorship and strong institutional support, will
position Dr. Edmonston to serve as the Principal Investigator on future R01 grants to support interventional trials
that target PH in ESRD and prospective studies which identify risk factors for PH in earlier stages of CKD."

The candidate’s career goal is to become an independent physician-scientist studying HIV and aging, and the
increased burden of medical co-morbidities and geriatric syndromes in older adults with HIV (OAH). The
candidate has laid the foundation for achieving this goal by gaining clinical expertise in caring for OAH,
conducting research, and obtaining a Master’s Degree in Clinical and Translational Investigation. To achieve
her career goal, the candidate will need to expand upon her geroscience and translational research skills,
including additional biostatistics and research methods training which are described in this resubmission.
A key component of the candidate’s training will be conducting the proposed research project. Despite
effective antiretroviral medications, OAH bear a greater burden of medical co-morbidities and geriatric
syndromes than their HIV-negative peers. Translational research investigating biomarkers inflammation offers
as opportunity for insight to the process of accelerated/accentuated aging that is observed in OAH. Cell-free
mitochondrial DNA (cfmtDNA) is released from cells undergoing stress and necroptosis-mediated cell death
and has the potential to serve as a mediator and marker of chronic immune activation and dysregulation.
We hypothesize that cfmtDNA will be associated with lower cognitive performance and greater frailty in a
longitudinal study of OAH. Previously, we have studied a cohort of OAH (age 55 and over) at our institution,
and those with cognitive impairment had higher average levels of cfmtDNA in plasma than participants without
cognitive impairment. We propose to leverage this existing study to investigate the following specific aims: 1)
Determine the association between cfmtDNA and cognition in OAH; 2) Determine the association between
cfmtDNA and longitudinal physical function in OAH; and 3) Evaluate the immunostimulatory potential of
cfmtDNA from OAH with and without cognitive decline. Participants from our existing cohort will be invited
back for two study visits separated by 18-24 months, each visit will include detailed neurocognitive
assessment, physical function measures, falls and instrumental and activities of daily living, and blood and
urine specimen collection for analysis and creation of a biorepository. Together, these investigations will shed
light on the relationship between cfmtDNA, immune activation and geriatric-related syndromes in OAH.
This project proposes a five-year, multifaceted training program under the mentorship of Dr. Marshall Glesby
as the primary mentor, as well as Drs. Mary Choi, Lishomwa Ndhlovu, and Eugenia Siegler as co-mentors.
Together with a Scientific Advisory Committee, they will provide the expertise in research design, biomarkers,
immunology and geroscience that will allow support the success of this project. The completion of the
proposed project will lead to an enhanced understanding of cfmtDNA as a biomarker of geriatric syndromes in
OAH, and a translational research tool to identify OAH at the highest risk of morbidity and mortality. After
completion of this project, the candidate will be poised to submit a competitive R03 and R01 proposals."
10824323,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive and rapidly fatal disease with no cure. PAH manifests
by remodeling of small pulmonary arteries, leading to increased PA pressure, elevated right ventricular (RV)
afterload, heart failure, and death. One of the key components of PA remodeling is increased proliferation and
survival of PA vascular smooth muscle cells (PAVSMC). Recently, I found that activation of Class III
Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase vacuolar protein sorting 34 (Vps34), evidenced by lack of inhibitory
phosphorylation at Ser164 (P-S164-Vps34), promotes hyper-proliferation of PAH PAVSMC, which is Akt-
dependent and is associated with accumulation of Vps15, deficiency of TSC2, activation of mammalian target of
rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), increased growth and proliferation of PAVSMC, and pulmonary vascular
remodeling in PAH. Similar to human PAH, decreased P-S164-Vps34 was also observed in PA VSM from
experimental rodent PH models, which is reversely correlated with increased PA medial thickness, and was
associated with increased RV systolic pressure (RVSP) and RV hypertrophy. Further, I show that Vps34
inhibition by siRNA significantly decreased PAH PAVSMC proliferation and survival, reduced Vps15 and restored
TSC2 protein levels, and inactivated mTORC1. Additionally, our data show that pharmacological inhibition of
Vps34 reverses PAH-specific signaling abnormalities, selectively inhibits proliferation and promotes apoptosis
in human PAH PAVSMC, and significantly attenuated established pulmonary vascular remodeling and reduced
RV hypertrophy in mice with SU5416/hypoxia-induced PH. Based on our preliminary data, I hypothesize that
Vps34 is activated in PAH PAVSMC in an Akt-dependent manner, leading to increased PAVSMC proliferation
and survival, pulmonary vascular remodeling, and PH via modulating Vps15 and TSC2-mTORC1 axis. I also
propose that pharmacological inhibition of Vps34 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in PAH PAVSMC,
and attenuates or reverses pulmonary vascular remodeling and PH. I will test my hypothesis using three specific
aims: Aim 1 will examine the status and mechanisms of Vps34 regulation in PAH pulmonary vasculature, Aim 2
will determine the role of Vps34 in human PAVSMC proliferation and survival, and Aim 3 will evaluate whether
molecular or pharmacological inhibition of Vps34 attenuates or reverses experimental PH in vivo. The proposed
study will identify a new critical mechanism of pulmonary vascular remodeling and dissect a new remodeling-
focused molecular target for therapeutic intervention."

This is a new application to support twelve graduate students in their second year of a Ph.D. Program in Genetics
and Genomics (PGG) at Harvard Medical School (HMS). Scientists in the fields of genetics and genomics are at
the forefront of our Nation’s efforts to understand how life works and to diagnose and treat human disease. The
mission of PGG is to provide a diverse group of students with the intellectual, technical, and professional training
that they will need to become future leaders in the fields of genetics and genomics. Training derives from a
customized curriculum, which emphasizes rigor and reproducibility in research, technical training, training in
scientific communication, professional networking, industry internship opportunities, and, of course, dissertation
research. PGG students carry out Ph.D. research in one of forty laboratories centered around, but not exclusive
to, the Department of Genetics at HMS. Laboratories of training faculty are well-funded and study a wide range
of topics in the fields of genetics and genomics, which range from prokaryotic gene regulation to human biology
and disease. Students supported by the training grant are part of the Biological and Biomedical Sciences (BBS)
program at HMS, which is a large umbrella program that draws in a top group of graduate students each year.
PGG provides a self-selected group of BBS students with the opportunity to be part of a close-knit community
focused on technical and professional training in the area of genetics and genomics. PGG students are required
to concentrate their course work in the fields of genetics and genomics, including a requirement to take at least
one course in the quantitative analysis of biological data, and one course overtly covering the need for rigor and
reproducibility in modern biomedical research. PGG students also participate in a set of programmatic activities,
including (1) an annual symposium, (2) attend and present at student-led monthly research presentations, 3)
networking opportunities with like-minded senior students and postdocs, including those studying clinical
genetics, and (4) hosting outside genetics or genomics-oriented scientists for seminars. Students will be guided
in courses and rotation selections by Program Advisors and by Dissertation Advisory Committees (DAC), which
will include PGG trainers. Student progress will be monitored via course grades, PA evaluations, DAC updates,
G3 research talks, and by faculty attendance at student seminars in the Genetics Department Data Club series.
PGG curriculum and policy will be guided by evidence-based teaching approaches incorporated into curriculum,
by course and program evaluations, and by a Steering Committee composed of PGG trainers and senior PGG

10848430,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The laboratory mouse is the preeminent animal model system for investigation into the biology and genetics of
human cancer. Mouse models have provided key insights into cancer susceptibility, the molecular genetics of
tumor suppressor and oncogenes, and therapy response in pre-clinical and co-clinical studies. Human tumors
engrafted into immune compromised and humanized mice (aka, Patient Derived Xenografts) are playing an
increasingly important role as a powerful preclinical platform for testing new cancer treatments.
The Mouse Models of Human Cancer (MMHC) database is a unique on-line compendium of mouse models for
human cancer. MMHCdb provides electronic access to expertly curated and harmonized information on
diverse mouse models for human cancer along with tools for accessing and visualizing associated data from
these models. This in turn, facilitates the selection of appropriate strains of mice for cancer genetics research.
MMHCdb integrates data derived from peer-reviewed literature and from direct submissions from researchers.
Data in MMHCdb are also obtained from other bioinformatics resources including PathBase, HUGO Human
Gene Nomenclature database, the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and ArrayExpress.
In this proposal we describe our plans for the continued development of MMHCdb with an emphasis on
expanded support for analysis of tumor genomic data and drug response data from Patient Derived Xenograft
models. To accomplish these goals we will build on successful collaborations to develop data standards for
PDX models that are now widely adopted. The major goals for the project renewal include the following:
· continue to populate MMHCdb with data on strain-specific patterns of tumorigenesis in inbred, mutant, and
 genetically engineered mice,
· leverage collaborations with Seven Bridges and PDXNet to analyze genomic data for PDX models using a
 common analysis pipeline,
· develop a platform for the analysis of PDX genomic and drug response data, and
· support the infrastructure of MMHCdb and our user community through ongoing database maintenance,
 development of new software components, user support services, and community outreach activities."
10872260,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide, causing over 700,000
deaths annually. In the US, HCC rates have tripled in the last three decades. The rise in obesity, non-alcoholic
fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is increasingly contributing to advanced
liver disease and HCC development. Chronic injury, inflammation and fibrosis are strongly associated with
disease progression and HCC development in patients and sufficient to trigger HCC in mice - suggesting that
HCC truly represents “a wound that does not heal”. Even though HCC may develop in the absence of overt
cirrhosis in NASH, almost all NASH-HCCs still develop in fibrotic livers. Hence, fibrosis is one of the most
prominent but least understood risk factors for HCC and NASH-HCC. Moreover, fibrosis is a main determinant
of outcomes and most therapeutic efforts in NASH aim to reducing fibrosis. Hence, understanding the role of
fibroblasts in HCC development in NASH is highly relevant. We and others have previously shown that hepatic
stellate cells (HSC) are the main source of fibroblasts in the liver. This proposal is based on preliminary data
showing for the first time by reliable and complementary genetic approaches a strong promotion of HCC
development by HSC. However, while the overall effect of HSC in chronic liver disease is tumor-promoting, we
made the striking observation that HSC can both promote and protect from HCC. Based on this, our central
hypothesis is that a cytokine- and growth-factor secreting subpopulation (cyHSC), resembling quiescent HSC in
the healthy liver, protect from NASH-HCC whereas highly activated myfibroblastic HSC (myHSC) promote
NASH-HCC. Linked to this, we also propose the higher percentage of cyHSC in normal liver provide protections
from HCC in the healthy state, whereas the higher percent of myHSC in injured livers contribute to disease-
associated promotion of HCC. Here, we seek to functionally characterize the contribution of HSC-derived
fibroblasts and subpopulation-specific mediators in NASH-associated HCC. We will first determine the role of
HSC-derived fibroblasts by genetic depletion and inhibition approaches, and characterize HSC subpopulations
and their cellular and ligand-receptor interactions and their evolution during disease progression by single cell
RNA-sequencing and CellPhoneDB in murine and human NASH (Aim 1). We will determine the role of myHSC-
secreted mediators, focusing on type I collagen, its receptors and downstream pathways (Aim 2) as well as the
role of cyHSC-secreted mediators, focusing on hepatocyte growth factor and CXCL12 (Aim 3), in NASH-
associated HCC. Together, the proposed studies will reveal novel insights into the pathophysiology of NASH-
HCC and provide evidence for tumor-promoting as well as tumor-suppressive functions of HSC. These studies
may not only open up new therapeutic avenues, targeting tumor-promoting pathways while sparing or restoring
tumor-suppressive pathways, but also shift current paradigms on the role of HSC in HCC development."

The University of Iowa Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) has successfully prepared students
for careers as physician-scientists since its inception as an NIH-funded MSTP in 1977. The goal of the
MSTP is to recruit, nurture, and graduate a diverse pool of well-trained physician-scientists with the
technical, operational, and professional skills necessary to transition into successful careers in the
biomedical research workforce. This goal is achieved through an integrated curriculum that assimilates
scientific and clinical training, constantly emphasizing the intersections between science and medicine.
Students complete 1.5 years of pre-clinical medical coursework, 4 to 5 years of graduate training, and
approximately 1.5 years of clinical clerkships to fulfill the requirements for both the MD and PhD degrees.
We have defined seven specific objectives for our graduating students, which are measured in our
evidenced-based evaluation process. Upon completion of the MSTP, graduating students will be able to:
1) Combine the knowledge bases of science and medicine to establish a strong foundation; 2) Integrate
critical thinking, reasoning and rigor in the conduct of research; 3) Demonstrate integrity in research and
clinical practice; 4) Demonstrate skills in oral and written communication; 5) Recognize the importance of
diversity, equity and inclusion; work effectively in a diverse professional environment, demonstrating
respect for individual differences; 6) Demonstrate leadership in research and clinical care; and 7)
Understand the diversity of career options for physician scientists. The U of Iowa MSTP is led by Co-PIs
Steven Lentz, MD, PhD (Director) and Pamela Geyer, PhD (Co-Director) who share a long-standing
passion for mentoring and training physician-scientists. The Program incorporates specific coursework
and activities throughout the course of study to provide integration and enrichment of the curriculum and
foster program identity, professionalism, teamwork, communication, career development skills, and
mentorship of students during transitions. The Program has 87 talented and diverse faculty members
who provide exciting research training opportunities. Students are extensively involved in MSTP
leadership, serving as members on the Executive, Admissions, MSTP Mondays, Seminar, Retreat,
Wellness, and Women's Group committees. The Program enjoys strong institutional support from the
Deans of the Carver College of Medicine and the Graduate College, who promote the MSTP as a driver
for innovation in research, education and service at the university. The U of Iowa MSTP currently has 73
trainees, of which 43% are women and 18% are from groups underrepresented in medicine. The majority
of our graduates have gone on to careers at major academic medical centers or research institutions.
This application requests support for 18 trainees per year, reflecting the strength and outcomes of our

10873848,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Cirrhosis is a leading cause of mortality in the United States (US), diagnosed in millions of people and resulting
in over 40,000 deaths each year, predominately in older people. These patients are at higher risk of serious
complications (e.g. infection, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy), hospitalization and death. Little is known about
the epidemiology and disease progression and older patients are more vulnerable and might have different risk
profiles. The clinical challenge is to accurately and early predict who is at highest risk for requiring
hospitalization and/or death and understanding how this might be different in older versus younger adults. .
One barrier to date has been the lack of an epidemiologically representative patient sample that captures those
with cirrhosis and goes beyond one health system, as many data repositories are skewed or limited: CMS only
captures elderly and those with debility, NIS does not allow longitudinal observation, UNOS represents less
than one percent of those with cirrhosis. Hence, we will build on our previous work to use a unique dataset, the
Chicago Area Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network (CAPriCORN). CAPriCORN captures the
electronic health records (EHR) from nine health systems from 2011-present (incl. academic center, county,
VA and private), catching most of the diverse patient population in the greater Chicago metropolitan area,
namely ~160,000 patients with liver cirrhosis. The dataset is extensive, allowing the use of traditional (e.g.,
regression) and novel analytical techniques (e.g. deep learning) to pursue the aims of the study. We aim to
model cirrhosis progression in the elderly and to predict the risk of hospitalization and death in older patients
with cirrhosis. We also aim to perform sub-group analyses focusing on race and socioeconomic factors in the
elderly. The impact of accurate and early prediction of mortality and hospitalization risk in elderly patients with
cirrhosis allows for targeted interventions of the most vulnerable patients to improve outcomes."
10878902,"Project Summary/Abstract
This proposal describes a rigorous training program leading to the career development of Dr. Anna Eisenstein
as an independent scientist. The principal investigator is a physician scientist who recently completed
Dermatology residency. Her career goal is to become an independent investigator studying the interplay between
the skin barrier and immune function, with a particular interest in allergic disease. She proposes to expand her
training in immunology and allergy through an intensive research experience under the co-mentorship of Dr.
Andrew Wang and Dr. Joseph Craft as well as a preeminent advisory committee with leading scientists and
physician scientists in immunology and dermatology. In addition to excellent mentoring, the proposal includes
rigorous coursework, seminars and external meetings. These planned activities will equip her with the necessary
skills to become a successful independent investigator.
The research objective of this proposal is to understand why individuals with atopic dermatitis (eczema) are more
prone to food allergies, both conditions whose prevalence are exponentially rising. Preliminary data reveals that
environmental xenobiotics, like common over-the-counter medications and food preservatives, act as allergic
adjuvants both when given orally or applied topically. These products were all found to activate the xenobiotic
receptor, Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2). Cutaneous disruption or topical application of Nrf2
activators was sufficient to induce sensitization to orally introduced food antigens, suggesting a novel mechanism
of sensitization, distinct from the current epicutaneous paradigm wherein food allergens are thought to physically
contact a damaged skin barrier to program the allergic immune response. The proposal will test the hypothesis
that disruption of the skin barrier and/or topical chemical adjuvants that activate Nrf2 in keratinocytes promote
epidermal production of alarmins, which signal on the intestinal epithelium and gut resident dendritic cells to
initiate allergic sensitization to coincident non-tolerized oral allergens in a skin-gut-immune axis using a unique
collection of full body and conditional knock out mice.
This proposal serves as a training vehicle for Dr. Eisenstein to become an expert in immunobiology, mechanisms
of allergic sensitization, and cutaneous barrier function so that she can apply this expertise to the field of
dermatology and harmonize her clinical and research programs for maximal impact in translating her basic
science investigations to the clinical management of atopic diseases. This project has the potential to explain
the modern rise in incidence of food allergies as well as the clinical association between eczema and food
allergies, which could lead to significant influence on public health and lead to novel therapeutic approaches to
food allergy. Furthermore, these results may yield important novel insights into our fundamental understanding
of the mechanisms of allergic sensitization."
10841009,"Project Summary/Abstract
The literature is inconclusive about who does and does not benefit from preventive interventions. Even less is
known about the unique combinations of participant risk factors that impact program effectiveness for low-income
families. These are crucial gaps to address, given that economically disadvantaged families vary in the level and
pattern of adversities they experience; and, these adversities may influence their response to intervention. One
of the few preventive interventions designed specifically to meet the needs of economically disadvantaged
families is Fatherhood, Relationship, and Marriage Education (FRAME), which combines the core elements of
two evidence-based programs: Premarital Relationship Education Program and Families Coping with Economic
Strain. On average, families benefitted from FRAME, but a portion of them did not experience the expected
gains. This project will examine whether certain types or combinations of pre-existing risk factors, such as
economic strain and parental depression, impacted response to FRAME. This information is critical for identifying
program responders and non-responders to inform tailored intervention approaches and maximize the efficacy
and cost-effectiveness of prevention programs for underserved families experiencing various types of adversity.
Using existing data from the FRAME study with low-income families (N = 301 mother-father-child triads), the
long-term goal of this study is to improve the effectiveness of family-based interventions to promote resilience to
adversity and address the Healthy People 2030’s initiative to strengthen the health and well-being of all people.
As a preliminary analysis, we conducted baseline latent class analysis (LCA) and identified four family risk
classes: Job Instability Only (low on all risk factors except job instability; 14%), Economic Stress, Depressed
Parents (high on economic stressors and parental depression; 41%), Extreme Family Dysfunction (high on all
risk factors; 33%), and Mothers At Risk (high mother victimization; 12%). Therefore, the overall objective of this
two-year R03 is to test the effects of these family risk classes on family mental health outcomes and intervention
effectiveness (i.e., families’ response to the FRAME intervention). The specific aims are to: (a) model the effects
of family risk classes on longitudinal family outcomes, (b) identify the effects of family risk classes on families’
engagement and response to intervention, and (c) examine racial and gender differences in family risk classes
and families’ response to intervention. This study will use a novel approach (i.e., latent class analysis and the
BCH method) to understand risk processes and test differential intervention effects. These contributions are
significant because they can inform efforts to maximize the cost-effectiveness of prevention programs for
economically disadvantaged families by ensuring that the most people benefit from the intervention."
10898661,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold-standard in clinical research but are subject to many
limitations including high costs, limited generalizability, and small sample sizes in patient subgroups. By
contrast, electronic health records (EHRs) are widely available and contain information on large and
representative patient cohorts. However, because they capture the uncontrolled observations of many
clinicians, they are highly susceptible to bias. The recent availability of the raw data from RCTs has created a
unique opportunity to integrate them with that from EHRs, and to innovate methods that exploit the distinct
advantages of each dataset.
 We propose to identify the zone of overlap between these data and build bridges in data representations.
These bridges could enable us to better emulate randomized trials using EHR data and measure the same
effects seen in the trials. Consequently, it would allow us to study subgroups that were excluded from the
pivotal trials associated with new drug approvals by the FDA.
 We will test these ideas out in the context of Ulcerative colitis (UC) and scale to others in future work. We
have obtained access to the raw data from 12 RCTs in UC (N=6,226). These data contain timed and structured
measurements of disease activity including the Mayo score, a composite score of patient symptoms and
endoscopic severity. We have also obtained access to the EHR data of 3,270 UC patients treated at the
University of California San Francisco. These data contain similar data as RCTs but largely in an unstructured
form. In addition, these assessments tend to be incomplete relative to trials due to costs and invasiveness of
some tests. We will address this problem of unharmonized and incomplete EHR data in three aims.
 In Aim 1, we will harmonize the RCT data into an analysis-ready format. We will also develop text
classification tools to transform free-texted EHR data into Mayo subscores, and validate these tools against
data from a second center. In Aim 2, we will integrate the RCT and EHR data, train algorithms to impute RCT-
based representations of the patient state from partial measurements made in EHRs, and test them under
conditions typifying real-world data capture. In Aim 3, we will use these algorithms to harmonize EHR data,
validate them as a tool to recover the same effects as RCTs, and study new patient subgroups.
 The applicant will carry out these aims and train in biostatistics, natural language processing, machine
learning, and overall career development. With the help of his mentors, he will launch a career dedicated to
developing and disseminating methods for learning from complex clinical data, and in so doing, promote a
future of better healthcare for all patients."
10892810,"SUMMARY
Liver cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer related mortality worldwide. Currently, in addition to
emerging immune checkpoint inhibitors, a small number of structurally related kinase inhibitors (KIs) are
approved for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most frequent form of liver cancer. While important,
these drugs provide modest improvements in survival— typically months—and often at the cost of significant
toxicity. The drugs, sorafenib, regorafenib, cabozantinib and lenvatinib are all multi-targeted KIs with poorly
defined mechanisms of action. As such, these drugs are given to HCC patients without any consideration to a
specific mutation within tumors. This presents a daunting challenge; without a clear target or mechanism, no
clear path exists to guide the development of improved therapies for HCC.
In this proposal, we combine chemical biology approaches to modify target preferences of clinically
approved HCC KIs and epigenetic tool compounds, and we develop precision genetically-engineered mouse
models and 3D tumor organoids in an integrated platform to identify new drug targets and therapeutics for
HCC. Our preliminary data demonstrate that different genomic drivers establish unique epigenomic landscapes
within tumor organoid lines, influencing the druggable space. Through chemical genetic screens, we have
identified lead compounds that are either pan-active across all HCC genotypes tested and some which are
selective to specific genetic backgrounds (e.g. WNTinib1 for WNT/β-Catenin driven tumors). By combining
chemical, proteomic, and target engagement data for WNTinib1, we have identified an unique p38a/b to Ezh2
signalling axis as a key and selective dependency to antagonize the activity of mutant β-Catenin. The major
hypothesis that we seek to test is that the unique epigenomic landscapes and dependencies on signaling
pathways, which are established by different HCC cancer drivers, confer differential sensitivity to specific targets
and small molecules. By taking advantage of driver-induced cancer mouse models, murine and human tumor
organoids, and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), we will be able to suggest stratification strategies and identify
more effective tailored therapeutics for HCC. The long-term goal of this proposal is to identify and characterize
at the mechanistic level, the signaling pathways and targets that enable (i) pan-activity across a variety of HCC
sub-types, (ii) selective activity in the context of tumors driven by specific mutations, (iii) synergistic tumor
inhibition in combination with immunotherapy approaches. Importantly, we have identified strong small molecule
leads, including WNTinhib1, that display superior efficacy compared to standard-of-care KIs across several HCC
models, including human samples.
 Key deliverables include new tools and leads for drug discovery derived from well-validated chemical starting
points and mechanistic insights into patient stratification and therapeutics for HCC."
10864990,"Precision magnetic hyperthermia by integrating magnetic particle imaging
Magnetic activation of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (MIONPs) offers considerable potential for numerous
biomedical applications. Approved clinical applications include contrast enhancement for magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) and magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH) for cancer treatment. MIONPs are T2 negative contrast
agents which have been clinically available for MRI since the late 1980s where very low tissue concentrations
(<100 g Fe/g tissue) are needed for imaging. MFH is a powerful nanotechnology-based treatment that enhances
radiation therapy (RT). It comprises local heating of tissue by activating MIONPs with an external alternating
magnetic field (AMF), enabling treatment anywhere in the body. Human clinical trials demonstrated benefits of
MFH for prostate cancer; and, overall survival benefits with RT in recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) resulted in
European approval in 2010. However, current MFH effectiveness is limited by the inability to visualize MIONP
distribution during MFH, resulting in poor AMF control of MIONP heating, reduced therapeutic efficacy, and
unwanted off-target toxicity. An integrated MIONP imaging-MFH technology that provides spatial control of the
MFH treatment volume will substantially advance the clinical use of theranostic MIONPs. Magnetic particle
imaging (MPI) is an emerging imaging technology that directly quantitates MIONP concentration in tissue with
similar or greater sensitivity as MRI. The main magnet in an MPI scanner produces a strong magnetic field
gradient containing a region where the magnetic field is approximately zero, i.e. the Field Free Region (FFR).
MIONPs in the FFR are magnetically unsaturated and can produce a signal in a receiver coil, while MIONPs
elsewhere are magnetically saturated and produce no signal. Images are produced by rastering the FFR across
the sample. The FFR used for imaging can be used to localize MFH. By applying a magnetic field gradient and
AMF, only MIONPs inside the FFR will heat while MIONPs outside the FFR are saturated and do not heat. MPI
and MFH are compatible enabling mm-precision spatial control of MFH. Our objective is to develop an integrated
MPI/MFH workflow that incorporates imaging-guided treatment planning with optimal theranostic MIONPs for
preclinical biomedical research with small animal (mouse and rat) models. We aim to achieve our objectives by
purchasing a HYPER AMF system that will be used with our recently acquired Momentum MPI scanner (funded
by a S10 shared instrumentation grant). Our specific aims are: (Aim 1) Identify MIONPs having ideal physical
and magnetic properties for MPI/MFH; (Aim 2) Develop MPI-guided MFH treatment using computational
modeling and amplitude modulation; (Aim 3) Demonstrate increased therapeutic efficacy of theranostic
MPI/MFH in vivo. While the primary objective of the proposed effort is technology development, successful
completion of the aims will provide biomedical researchers the ability to realize theranostic applications with
magnetic nanoparticles."
10892806,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health emergency. Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a high-priority pathogen
for AMR, as there are 87 million infections per year worldwide and the bacteria has demonstrated resistance to
every class of antibiotics recommended for its treatment. Treatment failures have been reported, typically involve
oropharyngeal infections, and are dire warnings that the era of untreatable gonorrhea is near. In the Western
Pacific Region, which includes Vietnam, resistance to ceftriaxone and azithromycin, the most commonly
recommended antibiotic therapy for gonorrhea, are increasing. Men who have sex with men (MSM) are
disproportionately affected by AMR in N. gonorrhoeae infections, but remain under-represented in data from low-
and middle-income countries (LMICs). The proposed study seeks to better understand AMR in N. gonorrhoeae
by embedding new research into an existing HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) program for MSM in Vietnam.
The study aims are 1) to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for AMR in N. gonorrhoeae among MSM
in a PrEP program in Vietnam; 2) to measure the frequency of pharyngeal N. gonorrhoeae treatment failures
and the association between pharyngeal infections and AMR; and 3) to use whole-genome sequencing (WGS)
to conduct a genomic epidemiology study of N. gonorrhoeae nested within our study population of MSM in a
PrEP program in Vietnam. The study will leverage regular testing for N. gonorrhoeae and follow-up that occur
through the PrEP program to shed new light on the issue of AMR in N. gonorrhoeae within this key population.
This Fogarty International Research Scientist Development Award (K01) is to support the career development
of Dr. Paul Adamson, an infectious diseases physician whose goal is to become an independent global health
investigator at the intersection of AMR and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The K01 will support Dr.
Adamson to develop expertise in 1) clinical microbiology and AMR testing, 2) WGS, bioinformatics, and genomic
epidemiology, and 3) advanced training in clinical trials research with a focus in LMICs. To achieve the proposed
research and training aims, Dr. Adamson has assembled a mentorship team with proven experience mentoring
early-career investigators and with expertise in STIs, epidemiology, AMR, biostatistics, and genomics. Drs.
Pamina Gorbach (UCLA) and Le Minh Giang (Hanoi Medical University, HMU) will serve as Primary Mentors
and have extensive experience in conducting large-scale prevention research studies and clinical trials on STIs
and HIV among MSM. In addition, his Co-Mentorship team includes Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, a US-based global
health researcher and an international expert on STIs and AMR in N. gonorrhoeae, and Dr. Nguyen Vu Trung,
a Vietnam-based researcher with expertise in clinical microbiology and antibiotic susceptibility testing in N.
gonorrhoeae. The proposed research and training aims leverage the strong research collaborations and the
robust research infrastructure that exist between UCLA and HMU. The IRSDA will advance Dr. Adamson's career
as an expert in STIs and AMR and establish him as an independent global health investigator."
10892072,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Although there are existing epidemiological studies of disparities in cancer incidence and outcomes, there are
very few studies of disparities in cancer genomes, which requires both germline, somatic, and clinical data from
the same patients. However, studying ancestry-specific genomic alterations is one of the most effective ways to
understand the underpinning mechanisms in cancer disparity, and develop potential prevention and therapeutics
strategies. Dr. Carrot-Zhang and others evaluated genetic ancestry effects on somatic alterations among 10,678
patients across 33 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas, and highlighted novel ancestry-specific
evolutionary trajectories from pan-cancer and tissue-specific analyses. We also suggested that ancestry
associations were profoundly tissue specific, and therefore, more samples from diverse ancestries are required
for tissue-specific analyses. To that extent, this proposal is based on large sequencing data sets composed of
1,153 lung cancer patients from Mexico and Colombia, and 60,085 lung cancer samples from Foundation
Medicine. Our overall goal is to understand the well-known, but mysterious, population-specific genomic
differences in lung adenocarcinoma. Our first aim is to systematically characterize the landscape of ancestry
effects on genomic features of lung adenocarcinoma, as we are well powered to detect new associations. Then
in the second aim, Dr. Carrot-Zhang will develop a novel statistical method leveraging the local ancestry
(ancestry of a genomic region) from ancestry-admixed populations to infer the heritability of ancestry-associated
somatic features. We will also explore the potential mechanisms underlying genomic differences related to
ancestry. Our third aim is to elucidate the influence of ancestry on clinical outcome, in order to improve
prognostics and precision medicine for the minority populations.
Dr. Carrot-Zhang’s long-term career goal is to improve cancer prevention, early detection and treatment by
integrating computational biology, germline genetics, and somatic genomics approaches to understand the
mechanisms underlying cancer initiation and progression. The K99 award will further prepare her for a successful
independent research career. Dr. Carrot-Zhang’s training will be carried out under the extraordinary mentorship
of Dr. Matthew Meyerson (cancer genomics), and an advisory committee consisting of Drs. Alexander (Sasha)
Gusev (population genetics and statistical genetics), Rameen Beroukhim (cancer biology), Heng Li
(computational method development), and David Kwiatkowski (clinical oncology). The proposed research plan
will be facilitated by the outstanding institutional environment of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the Broad
Institute. The scientific collaboration with Foundation Medicine will provide exceptional resources for cancer
genomics and ancestry-related analyses. The proposed professional development plan will enhance Dr. Carrot-
Zhang’s career advancement in laboratory management, grant-writing and leadership."
10891634,"ABSTRACT
The rapid spread of multi-drug resistance has created a great need for new combination
therapies to treat a variety of conditions, including infectious diseases and cancer. In one
pressing example, multidrug resistant tuberculosis (TB) affects about 500,000 people each year
and novel drug regimens are sorely needed. However, identifying new regimens has been
daunting in part due to the inability to prioritize among a very large number of possible drug
combinations. To address this need, we have generated an experimentally grounded, machine
learning algorithm, INDIGO-MTB, which predicts the synergy or antagonism of TB drug
combinations with high accuracy. Here we propose to adapt INDIGO-MTB into a multifactorial
pipeline to dissect combinatorial drug efficacy and drive preclinical regimen development for TB.
We will build in and validate the ability to predict drug interactions under stressful environmental
conditions that mimic TB infection, and extract molecular mechanisms of drug interactions. We
will then combine synergy and efficacy measurements to create new regimen rankings, which
we will validate both in vitro and in a mouse model of TB infection. Altogether, our work will
establish a tool for rapid assessment of TB drug combinations and a framework for applying this
approach to other conditions where new multidrug therapies are needed."

PROJECT ABSTRACT
The Society for Developmental Biology (SDB) is diversifying the community of developmental
biologists by supporting undergraduate students who are members of groups underrepresented
in basic/biomedical developmental biology and related research fields. SDB is able to achieve
this goal because of the Society’s unique infrastructure already in place by the Choose
Development! (CD) Program (2013-present), which provides a research-intensive undergraduate
training experience to undergraduate students at a lab of an established developmental biologist,
a multi-level mentoring plan for each student, society-wide recognition and enculturation activities
at national meetings and continued support in years after participation in the Choose
Development! Program. Key outcomes of the introductory Choose Development! Program
include: (1) Of a total of 33 undergraduate Fellows, 63% of Fellows that have graduated (27) have
entered a graduate program in developmental biology or closely related field (including one
MD/PhD), 11% have entered medical school, and 11% have taken gap years in preparation
towards submitting a more competitive application to graduate schools while working in their
previous mentors’ lab; (2) to date, a total of 10 publications have involved the research of CD
Fellows, with 8 manuscripts having a Fellow as a co-author and 2 crediting Fellows in the
acknowledgements; (3) increased awareness and appreciation across the entire SDB led to
proactive actions aimed at diversifying committees, Board of Directors, increased representation
from non-R1 institutions, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students on the Board and active
searches of underrepresented speakers at annual meetings. These cumulative outcomes of the
CD Program have provided these Fellows an atmosphere of inclusiveness within the entire SDB
and has impacted their continuation in the field. Proposed educational and mentoring activities
enhance the two-summer immersion requirement of each participant in the research laboratory of
an established SDB member anywhere in the USA. Summer hands-on research experiences by
trainees will take place in laboratories that study the development of multicellular organisms at
the molecule, cell, tissue, organ and whole organism levels and cover topics ranging from stem
cells and nuclear reprogramming to evolutionary developmental and systems biology, and from
computational analysis to identify gene regulatory networks involved in morphogenesis and
organogenesis to the etiology of disease - all topics of great relevance to the National Institute of
Child Health and Human Development."
10665988,"Neuroscientific data contain information from an incredible diversity of species and modalities that are

Distributed Archives for Neurophysiology Data Integration, is one such current effort to facilitate the
aggregation and dissemination of neurophysiology research data using best practices and standards, and has
grown to accommodate about 400TB of data across 100+ published datasets in slightly over 2 years. The
archive supports a broad range of users with different levels of expertise by providing a spectrum from
Web-based to programmatic mechanisms to access and upload data and helps improve the expertise through
training of the scientific user base through tutorials and workshops. We expect future datasets to be larger and
more multimodal, ranging in size from many TBs to PBs, with richer metadata. To support the next generation
of neuroscience researchers and to support the scales of computation and storage that will become necessary,
we must archive, preserve, and process this data in a scalable and accessible way that is meaningful to both
neuroscience researchers and software developers. In Aim 1, we will integrate neurophysiology applications
that scientists can easily use on large and diverse datasets to derive new insights and generate interactive

more precise interrogation and advanced analysis of data and help answer more specific neuroscientific

of DANDI data with related data available in other BRAIN Initiative archives. In Aim 3, we will improve
interoperability of data in DANDI with other neurophysiology software tools, platforms, and applications,
thereby strengthening the ecosystem of neurophysiology research. Community engagement and data reuse will
be further enhanced through yearly workshops aimed at improving the quality of data and metadata and
training users to use DANDI tools and data. Overall, we will address the growing data management and
dissemination needs of the neurophysiology community through a scalable, robust, interoperable, and
standards-based neurophysiology archive that provides an easy to use graphical and interactive interface as
well as computation services close to large datasets that can be accessed simply with a Web browser. We will
provide a platform for seamlessly integrating with and enhancing existing research workflows. We aim to
support scientific inquiry and collaboration, reduce redundancy in computation, and preserve and present

 Minimally invasive techniques that are constantly evolving have increased the skill
requirements for successful and safe surgical procedures. There has been an extensive effort in
the last two decades to develop medical simulators for training surgeons. However, much of the
work has focused on medical students and surgical residents who are currently in formal
training programs. There is a recognized need to ensure practicing surgeons maintain their level
of skills through continuous evaluation while simultaneously learning newer procedures or
equipment that get adopted into the OR. The objective of this proposal is to develop, evaluate
and validate simulation technologies to train, retrain and advance the performance and
resiliency of practicing surgeons. We plan to develop open source software templates for rapid
creation of high-fidelity simulations that include rare and adverse surgical events to enable
practicing surgeons maintain and enhance their surgical skill.
 In this project, we propose extending Interactive Medical Simulation Toolkit (iMSTK)-an
open source medical simulation platform, that has been used to prototype virtual trainers for
laparoscopic surgery, orthognathic surgery and other clinical applications. We will develop
software templates for rare and adverse event simulation, including hemorrhage (due to vessel
puncture and unintentional cutting), thermal injury, anatomical variation, and physiological
modeling. In most cases, physiological models are developed separately without coordination
with interactive surgical simulation limiting their capability. In this project, we will integrate
Kitware’s open source Pulse Physiological Engine with iMSTK to build a closed-loop physiology
model that handles local physiological changes and global, systemic physiological responses.
 This project is a collaboration between Kitware Inc. and the University at Buffalo School
of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences (UB) with an End-User Advisory Group (EAG) from
Children National Medical Center (CNMC) and Baylor University Medical Center (BUMC). The
institutes have a long record of collaboration in simulation technology development projects. We
will demonstrate the new software templates by building a virtual surgical simulator for
cholecystectomy with bile-duct injury and other complications that can occur in this type of
surgery. The End-User Advisory Group will meet with the technical team on regular basis to
provide feedback on the technical development. We will conduct face, content, and construct
validity test and learning assessment to validate the simulator."
10876418,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There is a critical need for effective pharmacotherapy for the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
(NAFLD). The proposed research is to conduct early-stage preclinical validation of new therapeutic leads that
target thioesterase superfamily member 1 (Them1; synonym Acyl-CoA thioesterase 11), a key enzyme of fatty
acid metabolism that becomes maladaptive in NAFLD. The long-term goal is to develop inhibitors of Them1 as
a therapeutic modality in the management of human NAFLD. The objective of this research is to optimize the
drug-like properties of small molecule inhibitors in order to create lead compounds, and to demonstrate their
safety, efficacy and specificity in cell-based assays and in experimental NAFLD using mice. Targeting Them1
with optimized small molecule inhibitors is expected to mitigate NAFLD by: 1) Increasing energy expenditure in
thermogenic brown and beige adipose tissue; 2) Decreasing hepatic steatosis, as well as glucose production
by the liver; and 3) Reducing inflammation in white adipose tissue. The rationale is that a lead compound that
addresses these three independent pathogenic contributions of Them1 should prove effective in NAFLD. We
have completed a high-throughput small molecule screen that has identified promising inhibitors targeting the
fatty acyl-CoA thioesterase activity of Them1. Motivated by extensive mechanistic data on the contributions of
Them1 to NAFLD pathogenesis, the development of inhibitors into lead compounds will be accomplished in
three specific aims: 1) To optimize the potency and specificity of Them1 small molecule inhibitors; 2) To
establish drug-like properties and efficacy in cell culture of early lead compounds; and 3) To evaluate
therapeutic lead compounds in experimental NAFLD using mice. In Aim 1, small molecule inhibitors will be
optimized by medicinal chemistry strategies to improve potency, specificity and drug-like properties. These
efforts will be guided by structure-activity relationships based on in vitro enzymatic assays, as well as
biophysical and structural determinants of Them1-inhibitor interactions. Aim 2 will evaluate early lead
compounds for drug-like properties, as well as cytotoxicity. Selected early leads will then be tested for efficacy
in primary cultured mouse and human cells for their capacities to increase fatty acid oxidation in brown
adipocytes and hepatocytes, to reduce hepatic glucose production in hepatocytes and to decrease production
of inflammatory mediators by white adipocytes. Specificity will be assessed using cells cultured from Them1-/-
mice. In Aim 3, lead compounds will be tested in mice for pharmacokinetics and tolerability. Upon establishing
dosing routes and schedules, efficacy to prevent and to reverse NAFLD will be assessed in mouse models.
Off-target effects will be evaluated using Them1-/- mice. The expected outcome of these studies is the
development and pre-clinical validation of optimized lead Them1 inhibitors that leverage novel mechanisms of
energy homeostasis, fatty acid and glucose metabolism, as well as inflammation in the medical management
of NAFLD."
10851027,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This application is in response to PA-20-194 Exploratory/Developmental Research Grant Program (Parent R21
Clinical Trial Required). While adequate nutrition is known to promote health-related quality of life by
addressing malnutrition and promoting optimal functioning among older adults, little is known about the impact
of clinical nutrition intervention as a therapeutic modality on heart failure (HF) outcomes. New patient-oriented
research on the effects of nutritional therapy on HF status and progression would greatly benefit older HF
patients who commonly experience malnutrition. Given the high human and economic costs associated with
HF complications among older adults, the development and clinical testing of nutritional standards represents a
much needed, low-cost, and prudent strategy likely to improve HF outcomes. This pilot study is designed to
prospectively test the effect of a prescribed, laboratory-prepared, home-delivered Dietary Approaches to Stop
Hypertension (DASH) diet intervention on clinically important markers of HF status. We will generate important
data of the effect of the dietary intervention on pulmonary artery pressures (PAPs) in patients with implanted
CardioMEMS™ hemodynamic monitoring device, a novel and groundbreaking approach to the early prediction
of acute decompensated HF and effective strategy to reduce rates of HF hospitalizations and mortality. Our
target population are older adults aged 65+ years with a diagnosis of HF who are stable on pharmacotherapy.
The central hypothesis is that short-term consumption of a DASH diet significantly improves HF status
among older patients. We will conduct a randomized crossover clinical study design (n=38, 50% women).
Outcomes after 4 weeks on the DASH diet will be compared to a 4-week “own diet” phase during which
patients will consume their self-selected, self-prepared diet based on usual care recommendations. Our
specific aims are: 1) to determine the effect of consuming a DASH diet for 4 weeks on levels of the natriuretic
peptide (NP) biomarkers BNP and NT-ProBNP which are strong prognostic markers in patients with chronic
HF; and 2) to examine the effect of consuming a DASH diet for 4 weeks on PAPs in HF patients with implanted
CardioMEMS™ device. We anticipate that HF status and PAPs will respond positively and timely to the
consumption of a 4-week 2,300 mg sodium-restricted DASH diet intervention. The study is supported by
preliminary data demonstrating safety, feasibility, and acceptability of the proposed intervention within the
Georgia Clinical and Translational Science Alliance (GA CTSA) infrastructure. In addition, the study team has
long-standing experience and expertise in cardiology, pathophysiology, nutrition, public health, and aging
related research within the GA CTSA environment and is well suited to carry out the proposed research."
10853068,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a geriatric syndrome that disproportionately impacts
older adults and is associated with high symptom burden, reduced quality of life, and a 5-year survival rate less
than 50%. Yet, few patients with HFpEF understand the condition, its anticipated trajectory, and/or prognosis.
This has several important implications, as our preliminary data show: (1) 33% of patients with a prior
hospitalization for HFpEF are unaware that they have a form of heart failure; (2) symptom burden is high and
engagement in symptom management is low; and (3) advanced care planning (ACP) is vastly underutilized
among this patient population. Symptom management and ACP are key features of palliative care, but
palliative care is either utilized at terminal disease stages or not at all. To address the urgent need to improve
symptom management and ACP earlier in the disease than has traditionally been done, we developed the
Conversations Helpful for Awareness of Illness Trajectory (CHAT) intervention. This intervention is grounded in
self-determination theory, which outlines the importance of competence, autonomy, and relatedness in driving
behavior change. CHAT will provide knowledge (competence), improve patient activation and self-efficacy
(autonomy), and strengthen the patient-physician relationship (relatedness) through a combination of online
patient-facing video-based modules using the Patient Activated Learning System (PALS) platform and a health
coach who will guide patients through the online modules to promote active engagement. The objectives of this
proposal are to: (1) refine the CHAT intervention by incorporating key stakeholders’ feedback through semi-
structured qualitative interviews of patients, caregivers, and physicians, and (2) pilot test the CHAT intervention
for feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy through a pilot randomized controlled trial. MPIs Goyal and
Shen have complementary areas of expertise in HFpEF, implementation science, communication-based
interventions, and social psychological frameworks. The investigator team also includes a primary care
physician with expertise in intervention development who also created PALS, a nurse scientist with expertise in
heart failure self-care and patient-reported outcomes, and a geriatrician/palliative care specialist with expertise
in decision-making in heart failure and implementation science. The long-term objective is to develop a model
for communicating illness trajectory to promote proactive patient engagement in managing symptoms (and
improve QOL), and engagement in ACP. This proposal seeks to move beyond traditional siloed approaches of
care to address the need to “incorporate palliative care approaches for aging-related conditions by healthcare
practitioners who are not palliative care specialists.”"
10805481,"Obesity is one of the most important medical and public health problems in the United States. According to
recent nationally representative studies, every third adult in the U.S. is obese. Motivational Interviewing (MI),
a client-centered and directive approach to behavior change counseling, has been widely adapted for treating
obesity. Despite the evidence presented in published meta-reviews that suggests that MI is effective at
activating behavioral changes, anthropometric changes are less significant. At the same time, there are several
access barriers to this type of behavioral health care, such as shortage of human counselors in certain
geographical areas, long wait times, cost, and fear of judgment. Recent advances in deep learning have allowed
artificial intelligence (AI) methods to expand into the areas of health care that were previously thought to be
the exclusive province of human experts, such as clinical diagnostics. Behavioral health and MI, however, are
the areas of medicine that have not yet substantially benefitted from modern AI technologies, such as neural
conversational agents. To address this limitation, the proposed project aims to test the feasibility and usability
of using neural conversational agents for automated behavioral counseling with a focus on weight loss.
Specifically, we build on recent advances in deep learning, such as conversational agents, neural attention,
transformers, supervised policy learning, variational autoencoders and adversarial training, and aim to develop
and validate Neural Agent for Obesity Motivational Interviewing (NAOMI), a mobile device (smartphone or
tablet) application to conduct automated MI counseling focused on weight loss. NAOMI is based on a novel
neural architecture, which consists of neural networks that can be independently and collectively trained using
the proposed multi-stage procedure to learn communication behaviors, which should be strategically utilized
during different stages of an MI counseling session depending on the observed interactions and generate
responses that are grounded in session context and reflect patient’s language. We will recruit 40 obese adults,
who will interact with NAOMI and provide their feedback through semi-structured qualitative interviews. We
plan on conducting at most 4 iterative development cycles of NAOMI with 10 patients participating in each
cycle. We will conduct a mixed-methods sub-study after each development cycle. Quantitative evaluation of
NAOMI’s MI counseling skills will be conducted based on the transcripts of participants’ interactions by a
coder trained in using the MI Treatment Integrity (MITI) coding system, a standard instrument for assessing
MI fidelity. Qualitative interviews with the participants will be analyzed using Framework Matrix Analysis. The
methods and techniques proposed in this project can be adapted to other types of psychotherapeutic
interventions besides MI and to other conditions besides obesity."

As factors involved in all aspects of RNA processing, RNA binding proteins (RPBs) are master regulators of
gene expression. Despite this critical role, gaps remain in our understanding of how RBPs interact with RNA.
Generally, RBPs have been considered to interact with typically single-stranded RNA via folded RNA-binding
domains. However, many RBPs also have inherently disordered domains of low compositional complexity (low
complexity domains, LCDs). In our current understanding of how RBPs interact with RNA, LCDs mediate protein-
protein interactions and/or weak, non-specific RNA interactions. In contrast, a growing body of literature, and our
own data, indicate LCDs are capable of specific binding to highly stable guanine-based helical RNA structures.
These findings represent a reversal of the canonical binding mode: rather than folded protein binding to
unstructured RNA, we have observed folded RNA binding to unstructured protein. My research program asks i)
how do RBP LCDs interact with RNA? And, ii) what are the functional consequences of LCD-RNA interactions?
This proposal outlines my research program to decipher basic mechanisms and dynamics of RBP-RNA
interactions and define their role in normal and pathogenic pathways combining unbiased biochemical
approaches with cell-based genomic strategies. Data generated from the proposed research will contribute
broadly across all areas of cell biology by illuminating a more complete picture of RBP-RNA interactions."

Infection is a dynamic interplay between host and pathogen, coordinated through each organism's signaling and
gene regulatory networks. The world's deadliest pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), can exploit its
network of molecular interactions with the host to elicit an infection steady state that enables it to persist
asymptomatically for up to decades. Perturbations in Mtb's or the host's network activities that tip the balance of
this molecular homeostasis will alter infection outcomes: either pathogenically toward a symptomatic tuberculosis
(TB) disease with rampant Mtb growth and pathological inflammation that could lead to death, or protectively
toward infection clearance. I will dissect host signaling and Mtb regulatory network activities for infection fate-
deciding tipping-point genes that impact Mtb viability and host inflammation during infection in primary human
monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), a major infected host cell in vivo. I will profile the host and pathogen
transcriptional responses to these infection-altering perturbations to define molecular mechanisms underlying
the host-pathogen interplay, and I will use this information to identify synergistic joint interventions that
concurrently target host and pathogen. Identifying these tipping-point genes at the host-pathogen interface
should inform new therapeutic intervention strategies that jointly target host and pathogen to elicit host protection,
while also revealing fundamental insights into pathogenesis."
10885136,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the progressive impairment of cognitive and
memory functions and is the most common form of dementia in the elderly. It affects 5.6 million
Americans over the age of 65 and exacts tremendous and increasing demands on patients,
caregivers, and healthcare resources, making this condition among the most significant public
health problems of our time. Despite extensive studies, our understanding of the biology and
pathophysiology of AD is still limited, hindering advances in the development of therapeutic and
preventive strategies. Genetic studies of AD have successfully identified 40 novel loci but these
explain only a fraction of the overall disease risk, suggesting opportunities for additional
discoveries. Advanced neuroimaging is an essential part of current AD clinical and research
investigations, which generally focus on relatively few imaging phenotypes developed by neuro-
radiologists. However, there is a growing interest in exploiting the high-content information in
large-scale, high dimensional multimodal neuroimaging data to identify novel AD biomarkers.
Deep learning (DL) methods, an emerging area of machine learning research, uses raw images
to derive optimal vector representations of imaging contents, which can be used as informative
AD endophenotypes. To overcome the low interpretability traditionally attributed to DL, whole
genome sequence data provide an opportunity to identify novel genes underlying the DL-
derived imaging endophenotypes and test their association with AD and AD-related traits in
large cohort samples. The proposed project will leverage existing neuroimaging and genetic
data resources from the UK Biobank, the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP), the
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and the Cohorts for Heart and Aging
Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium, and will be conducted by a
multidisciplinary team of investigators. We will derive AD endophenotypes from neuroimaging
data in the UK Biobank using deep learning (DL). We will identify novel genetic loci associated
with DL-derived imaging endophenotypes and optimize the co-heritability of these
endophenotypes with AD-related phenotypes using UK Biobank genetic data. We will leverage
resources and collaborations with AD Consortia and the power of DL-derived neuroimaging
endophenotypes to identify novel genes for Alzheimer's Disease and AD-related traits. Also, we
will develop DL-based neuroimaging harmonization and imputation methods and distribute
implementation software to the research community. We expect to discover new genes relevant
to AD which may leads to understanding of molecular basis of AD and potential new treatment."

Impairments in decision-making are both a risk factor for and consequence of an Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD).
These impairments are particularly debilitating as there are currently no approved pharmacotherapies
designed to improve this aspect of an AUD. Impulsivity is a behavioral phenotype that reflects alterations in the
decision-making process and is broadly characterized as the tendency to act without foresight and can be
fractionated into several different subtypes. Non-planning impulsivity is a subtype of impulsivity characterized
by the tendency to make decisions in a way that is not guided by plans or future goals. In addition, of all
impulsivity subtypes a recent meta-analysis indicates that non-planning impulsivity is a strong predictor of
alcohol dependence in humans. Therefore, there is a critical need to explore the neural basis of planning and
impulsivity to inspire novel treatment approaches capable of addressing this pathology. In addition, previous
work from our group in rodents converges with data from human subjects that indicates targeting the prefrontal
cortex (PFC) may provide an effective way to reduce addiction-associated behaviors. The overarching
hypothesis of this project is that targeting the pathology of the PFC will rescue impairments in
decision-making observed in rodent models of AUD. A series of preclinical studies are proposed that will
use rigorous and cutting-edge techniques to measure and manipulate neural activity in awake, behaving
rodents. Heterogeneity in the animal models used will broaden the impact of the results by making them
applicable to those with and without family history/genetic risk factors for problematic alcohol use as well as
sex differences. Our previous work and preliminary data indicate that neural and behavioral signatures of
planning are disrupted in excessive drinking animals. To explore the neural basis of this disruption and how to
fix it, designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) will be used to target and
manipulate the activity of PFC neurons during behavior. In addition, large scale neural recordings from the
PFC will be performed while animals are engaged in behavioral tasks designed to either measure impulsivity or
the decision to consume alcohol. Finally, novel and rigorous statistical procedures and computational modeling
approaches will be used to analyze the neural recordings obtained. These approaches will create a generative
model of the data and therefore provide a detailed picture of the computations performed by these neurons. In
this way, a clear mechanistic picture of the role that PFC neurons play in guiding behavior will be created by
establishing causal inference between neural activity and behavior. In summary, the proposed work will identify
how decision-making is altered in rodent models of AUD and how to improve it. This work will bring this
program of research closer to its long-term goal of inspiring novel targets for treatment that are capable of
addressing impaired decision-making in AUD."
10847513,"ABSTRACT
In the final six months of life older adults often receive invasive treatments despite their preferences to avoid
burdensome interventions with limited efficacy. Strategies to reduce overtreatment at the end of life have
focused on improving communication and decision making, yet systems-level practice patterns have a strong
influence on the delivery of patient care. My patient-oriented research program focuses on improving major
treatment decisions for older adults with serious illness. As a sought after mentor for early-career investigators,
I now wish to expand my research program to include the human factors and systems-level forces that lead to
these decisions and build a robust pipeline of researchers focused on improving care for older adults.
Use of systems engineering to evaluate the initiation of life-supporting treatments in older adults with
life-limiting illness is a five-year K24 Midcareer Investigator's Award in patient-oriented and aging research
responding to PA-20-186. Our research team has previously recognized systems-level practice patterns
leading to overtreatment and developed a conceptual model to describe this phenomenon that we call clinical
momentum. We theorize that clinical momentum is a major contributor to overtreatment for older adults with
life-limiting illness and is an important barrier to the success of communication interventions designed to
improve care at the end of life. The objective of this proposal is to use a systems engineering approach to
characterize the systems in which decisions about life-supporting treatments occur and to employ user-
centered design to generate interventions to improve patient, clinician and organizational outcomes. In this
observational study we will perform a comparative analysis of the initiation of life-supporting treatments,
specifically dialysis, feeding tube placement, and prolonged mechanical ventilation, which will provide a rich
laboratory for a variety of mentored projects. For aim 1, we will use a systems engineering approach to
characterize patterns of care leading to initiation of life-supporting treatments. For aim 2, we will develop
interventions to disrupt clinical momentum for older adults with life-limiting illness.
This award will allow me to (1) build a new direction of research and investigative skills and (2) expand my
capacity and skill as a mentor and to increase the number of young investigators who aim to develop a career
in patient-oriented and aging research. This research is innovative because it uses a novel empirical strategy
to identify practice patterns that may play a critical role in the provision of overtreatment for older adults with
life-limiting illness. This research is significant because characterizing the role of clinical momentum in the
initiation of life-supporting treatments has the potential to unlock the pathway to care truly driven by patient
preferences instead of systems-level incentives and forces. With my strong mentorship team, career
development plan, and the resources of existing studies I am well-positioned to achieve these objectives."

10894706,"SUMMARY ABSTRACT
We have demonstrated that mutation of the staphylococcal accessory regulatory (sarA) in Staphylococcus
aureus results in an increase in the production of extracellular proteases to a degree that limits biofilm
formation, limits cytotoxicity for mammalian cells including osteoblasts and osteoclasts, and limits the
accumulation of both surface-associated and extracellular virulence factors. We have also demonstrated that
this can be correlated with decreased virulence in animal models of sepsis and osteomyelitis. Moreover, we
have confirmed that all of these phenotypes are evident in diverse clinical isolates of S. aureus and that they
can be reversed by eliminating the ability of sarA mutants to produce extracellular proteases. In this proposal,
we will expand on these observations to identify the specific extracellular proteases that are most relevant in
the context of our underlying scientific hypothesis in diverse clinical isolates of S. aureus (Aim 1) and use the
information gained to interrogate the impact of these proteases on the virulence factor repertoire on these
clinical isolates, define the impact sarA and these proteases on bone remodeling and the host response in
bone infection, and ultimately identify and evaluate the contribution of specific S. aureus virulence factors alone
and in combination with each other on these phenotypes (Aim 2)."

 Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is one of the most common inherited intellectual disabilities (ID) that is caused
by transcriptional silencing of the Fmr1 gene and loss of its encoded fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein
(FMRP). FXS manifests with cognitive impairment, hyperactivity/seizure, sensory hypersensitivity, and several
autistic features such as repetitive behaviors and social withdraw. FMRP has been shown to be primarily a RNA-
binding protein that regulates translation of many mRNAs. In the mammalian CNS, astroglial cells play active
and diverse roles in modulating synaptogenesis and synaptic functions, especially during postnatal development.
How the loss of FMRP affects astroglial development and functions, especially underlying molecular
mechanisms, just begin to be understood. MicroRNAs (miRs) are a class of noncoding RNAs with a mature
length of 20-25 nucleotides that primarily bind to the 3’UTR of target mRNAs to significantly modulate gene
expression by either inhibiting mRNA translation or inducing mRNA degradation. Biochemical and genetic
evidence in neurons have implicated important roles of miR pathways in FMRP-mediated translational regulation.
Additionally, miRs play key roles in the specification of neural progenitor cells and oligodendrocyte and microglia
developmental maturation. Surprisingly, how miRs are involved in astroglial development especially postnatal
molecular and morphological maturation is essentially unknown. This represents a significant obstacle to better
understand astroglia-mediated pathogenic pathways in FXS.
 Based on our preliminary results and progress we made during previous funding period in understanding
the role of astroglia in FXS pathogenesis, in this renewal, we propose the following aims: Aim 1: Determine the
roles of miR-128-3p in regulating postnatal astroglial development; Aim 2: Determine the pathogenic roles of
increased astroglial miR-128-3p in FXS. We have generated astroglial miR-128 conditional knock-out (Astro-
miR-128 CKO) and astroglial miR-128/Fmr1 double conditional knock-out (Astro-miR-128/Fmr1 DCKO) mice
and have generated a large amount of preliminary data to support our rationales and to demonstrate feasibility
for proposed aims. We will employ mouse genetics, primary astroglial cultures, electrophysiology, virus injections,
confocal and immunoEM imaging, and behavioral approaches to complete these aims. Outcomes from this
project will begin to define specific miRs that regulate postnatal astroglial molecular and morphological
maturation. In addition, the analysis of FXS-relevant synaptic and behavioral phenotypes on Astro-miR-128/Fmr1
DCKO mice will potentially provide a new astroglial target to modulate FXS disease development, thus will
significantly advance our understanding about astroglial mechanisms in FXS pathogenesis."

Episodic memory and memory-guided decision making are quintessential cognitive functions
ensuring our identity, successful everyday life, and survival. Memories have a strong spatial and
temporal sequential component. The field of memory research has long used rodent spatial
navigation on linear environments as a framework for studying memory encoding and
consolidation. Large-scale electrophysiological recordings from the adult rodent brain performed
during animal navigation in novel environments have established that neuronal ensemble
computations within and between the hippocampus and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) are
critical for the encoding and consolidation of spatial memories. During memory-guided decision-
making tasks, the hippocampus and mPFC neurons re-engage in coordinated computations and
communication, particularly during the successful trials. Optimal investigation of memory and
decision-making processes require simultaneous interrogation of large ensembles of neurons
from interconnected brain areas such as MEC and the hippocampus, and hippocampus and
mPFC, respectively. Without exception, these experiments have been performed exclusively in
adult animals where large neuronal samples could be obtained in freely-behaving rodents. Yet
these findings in the adult brain raise new critical, still unanswered questions: When and how do
coordinated activities between hippocampal neuronal ensembles and their
upstream/downstream MEC emerge during postnatal life to support encoding and consolidation
of long-term memories? When and how do mPFC neuronal ensemble patterns critical for
decision making mature and how does their coordination with the hippocampus develop during
postnatal life? In this proposal, I will investigate the age- and experience-dependent early-
postnatal development of neuronal ensemble patterns known to be significant for spatial
memory and navigation and decision making in the adult rat. The chronic, large-scale
electrophysiological recordings will be performed over several days in freely-behaving and
sleeping developing and adult rats simultaneously from interconnected brain areas, MEC and
the hippocampus and the hippocampus and mPFC, respectively. These experiments will define
the principles and stages of coordinated development across connected brain areas, their age
and experience-dependence and the developmental critical periods specific to each brain area
investigated."

The purpose of the NIDA Animal Genetics Program is to identify genetic, genomic, epigenetic variants,

intravenous self-administration or next-generation genome sequencing to perform advanced genetic,
molecular, and cellular studies to further our understanding of the biological changes underlying addiction-like
behaviors. While these efforts have been very successful in achieving the planned milestones, it has become
clear that our project would benefit from an even larger sample size. In particular, increasing sample sizes lead
to exponential rather than linear increase in the number of loci identified, and would allow us to identify sex-
specific gene variants. Moreover, in the past four years there has been tremendous technological advances in
behavioral and genetic analysis that can be leveraged to provide unprecedented access to identify the single
nucleotide and structural variants that contribute to complex behavioral endophenotypes of high relevance to
oxycodone use-disorders. The first goal of this competing renewal is to double the sample size of the current
GWAS to increase the number of gene variants identified including sex-specific variants and meet the
demands of the Biobank. The second goal is to use high-throughput behavioral phenotyping using markerless
pose estimation based on machine learning with deep neural network to identify behavioral endophenotypes
that can help predict and identify individuals with a resistant, mild, moderate, or severe phenotype of
oxycodone addiction-like behaviors. The third goal is to use methodological improvements of the genetic
analysis, including the analysis of structural variants and tandem repeats, as well as enhanced integration with
gene expression data. The fourth goal is to strengthen the oxycodone biobank infrastructure. This project is
likely to continue having a sustained and powerful impact on the field because it will provide an exponential
increase in the number of genetic loci identified, eQTLs and PheWAS analysis related to addiction-like
behavior; establish the first high-throughput behavioral motifs analysis of addiction-like behaviors using parallel
video-recording and automated machine learning analysis; identify novel behavioral endophenotypes of
vulnerability/resistance to addiction-like behaviors; and expand and improve the Oxycodone Biobank offering
and infrastructure."
10885113,"Each year, millions of Americans receive evidence-based psychotherapies (EBPs) such as cognitive
behavioral therapy (CBT) for the treatment of mental and behavioral health problems. Yet, at present, there is
no scalable method for evaluating the quality of psychotherapy services. In research settings, human-based
behavioral coding methods are used, but these are time consuming, costly, and rarely used in real-world
clinical settings. Thus, EBP quality and effectiveness is unmeasured and unknown. The current, fast-track
STTR proposal will develop and evaluate an AI-based software system (LyssnCBT) that will automatically
estimate CBT fidelity from an audio recording of a CBT session. Importantly, the current work builds from
Lyssn’s previous, successful work in developing an automated system for evaluating motivational interviewing
(MI), and previous research showing that AI algorithms can accurately estimate CBT fidelity.
 Lyssn.io, Inc., (“Lyssn”) is a start-up developing AI-based technologies to support training, supervision,
and quality assurance of evidence-based counseling. Our goal is to develop innovative health technology
solutions that are objective, scalable, and cost efficient. Lyssn offers a HIPAA-compliant, cloud-based platform
for secure recording, sharing, and reviewing of therapy sessions, which includes AI-generated metrics for MI.
The proposed LyssnCBT tool will build from and be integrated into this core platform. Lyssn is partnering with
Dr. Torrey Creed and the Penn Collaborative, which has a 14+ year track record of gold-standard CBT training
and supervision, including more than 100 community agencies with almost 900 providers. The expertise,
relationships, and amassed data -- more than 8,000 recorded sessions and more than 3,000 rated for CBT
fidelity -- form the clinical foundation for the current research.
 Phase I will work from an existing AI-CBT prototype to develop LyssnCBT. Core activities include
user-centered design focus groups and interviews with community mental health (CMH) therapists,
supervisors, and administrators, which will inform the design and development of LyssnCBT. LyssnCBT will be
evaluated for usability and implementation readiness in a final stage of Phase I. Phase II will conduct a
field-based usability trial and a stepped-wedge, hybrid implementation-effectiveness randomized trial (N =
1,850 CMH clients) to evaluate the effectiveness of LyssnCBT to improve therapist CBT skills and client
outcomes, and to reduce client drop-out. Analyses will also examine the hypothesized mechanism of action
underlying LyssnCBT.
 The research is strongly aligned with NIMH’s 2020 Strategic Plan and its emphasis on a computational
approach to scaling up treatment delivery and monitoring. Successful execution will provide automated,
scalable CBT fidelity feedback for the first time ever, supporting high-quality training, supervision, and quality
assurance, and providing a core technology foundation that could support a range of EBPs in the future."
10857230,"Project Summary
RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions lie at the heart of essential steps of the eukaryotic gene
expression pathway. Defects in these interactions due to inherited mutations can result in age-
dependent degeneration of the retina, motor neurons, and other neural tissues. The proposed
studies will result in a better understanding of RNA-based mechanisms of gene expression in
both the normal and disease states. In the next five years we will pursue three main goals, using
the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a facile model system. First, we will examine the
molecular mechanism of activation of the spliceosome for the first catalytic step of pre-mRNA
splicing. This process requires allosteric signal transmission through RNA and protein over
distances of 100 angstroms or more and results in large-scale remodeling of the spliceosome to
allow progression of the splicing cycle. Second, we will elucidate the basis for regulation of
expression of a key enzyme in purine nucleotide metabolism, IMPDH, interrogating both
transcriptional and post-transcriptional steps. Inherited alterations in a regulatory domain of
IMPDH and in proteins that direct spliceosome activation are associated with autosomal
dominant retinitis pigmentosa, which leads to progressive blindness. We will look for
commonalities between the two processes that might explain the highly specific pathological
consequences of these disease mutations. Third, we will examine the functions of the hnRNP
protein Hrp1 in the regulation of elongation and termination by RNA polymerase II. Hrp1 is
structurally related to human hnRNP proteins in which inherited substitutions cause
neurodegenerative disorders, including ALS and FTLD. Furthermore, Hrp1 exhibits a similar
propensity to form intracellular aggregates, which are associated with pathology of the human
proteins. A more complete understanding of these fundamental processes should lead to more
accurate diagnosis and prognosis of diseases caused by alterations in nuclear RNA-binding
proteins, and may ultimately result in new therapeutic approaches. Furthermore, the proposed
studies will illuminate basic mechanisms of eukaryotic gene expression that can be exploited for
synthetic biology and biotechnology."

Data Center (DC) and NIH program staff. We collaborate and communicate with the other Lab Hubs on QA/QC
programs including proficiency testing and common QC pools, technical replicates and blinded duplicates, and
methods to minimize batch effects and inter-lab variability, issues for which our team played key roles in the
first grant cycle of CHEAR. We coordinate internally to maximize efficiency and can nimbly alter our priorities
as directed by the CC. We organize weekly Steering Committee (SC) meetings of the Hub to coordinate intra-
Hub work flow including receipt of sample shipments, re-labeling, tracking, and entry in to our laboratory
information management system (LIMS). We organize PI/Client consultation meetings in which we review the
parent study for design, sample specimen availability, study subject exposure scenarios, health phenotypes,
and requested types of chemicals exposures to be measured. We will then make recommendations that best fit
the PI/Client's goals, while addressing any scientific or technical issues that may limit feasibility prior to
conducting assay analysis. We also track the progress of on-going jobs and generate regular reports to the
Coordinating Center and NIH program. We coordinate data reporting with the HHEAR Data Center (DC),
ensuring that our databases are properly formatted and contain the appropriate metadata. We also collaborate
with the DC and Client/PI in the interpretation of results, (e.g. how specific gravity or sample evaporation may
impact metabolomics measures in urine) and the statistical analysis of exposure/phenotype relationships. We
will organize and implement an annual Lab Hub workshop that will engage existing and potential clients in
Exposure Biology assay methodologies. We were the only Lab Hub to organize such a meeting under CHEAR
– the New York Exposome Symposium (November 2 - 3, 2018) which drew 200 scientific participants. We use
a web based LIMS interface for tracking job progress through the Lab Hub system and to assess QA/QC in
real time during analysis. In sum, we 1) coordinate communication internally within the Lab Hub and externally
with the Coordinating Center, Data Center, PI/Clients and NIH program; 2) develop the procedures, protocols
and system checks to ensure samples flow to the correct Resource/Core and that QA/QC protocols are
followed rigorously; 3) maintain a LIMS that is user friendly, facilitates sample tracking, prevents mismatches
between samples and results, and integrates with the needs of the Data Center; 4) provide scientific
consultation services to PI/Clients that maximizes the information and quality of their study results; 5) ensure
that feedback communication occurs between Clients and Resources/Cores and that this information is relayed
transparently to the CC and NIH and 6) ensure transparent fiscal management of the Lab Hub program."

 This career development award will provide Dr. Nilay Shah the opportunity to develop as an independent
investigator of community and clinical cardiovascular disease prevention in the South Asian American
population, and build on his experience in population epidemiology and clinical cardiovascular medicine. South
Asians experience a disproportionately higher burden of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) at
younger ages compared to other race/ethnic groups, but little is known about antecedent cardiovascular health
in 2nd generation young adult South Asian Americans to inform early life prevention strategies in this risk-
enhanced group. The proposed application aims to pilot MASALA-2G, the Multi-level Assessment of the South
Asian Life-course of Atherosclerosis (2nd Generation Offspring Study), an offspring study to the Mediators of
Atherosclerosis in South Asians Living in America (MASALA) cohort who are predominantly 1st generation
immigrant South Asians. MASALA-2G represents a foundational investigation in the cardiovascular health of
the South Asian American population and aligns directly with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
mission and objective to promote the prevention of heart diseases in diverse populations. Under the
mentorship of Drs. Namratha Kandula and Mark Huffman, who are leading researchers with combined
expertise in South Asian health, prevention intervention trials, community engaged research, and
implementation science, Dr. Shah proposes a comprehensive research and multidisciplinary career
development plan composed of formal coursework, intensive mentorship, and experiential training in cohort
management and community engagement in health disparity populations, advanced statistical methods for
multi-level associations, genomics, and implementation science. The Specific Aims are to: (1) pilot the
MASALA-2G study of cardiovascular health in 2nd generation SA adults age 21-40 years, who are offspring of
MASALA parent study participants; (2) determine multi-level contributors to cardiovascular health and coronary
artery calcium in MASALA-2G participants; and (3) contextualize a cardiovascular health promotion behavioral
intervention for this population based on quantitative findings, following the Intervention Mapping framework.
The proposed research and training will occur at Northwestern University, which provides Dr. Shah with: (1)
access to unparalleled infrastructure and partnerships for research in the South Asian community, (2) a
multidisciplinary team of mentors and collaborators with comprehensive relevant expertise, (3) strong
institutional support from the Division of Cardiology and Department of Preventive Medicine, and (4) training
opportunities including in Northwestern’s Center for Community Health, Center for Global Cardiovascular
Health, and Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute. Ultimately, this research and career development will
enable Dr. Shah’s transition to independent research for cardiovascular prevention in South Asian populations."
10904990,"Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne illness in the US. Currently, there are no vaccines available to
prevent Lyme disease and antibacterial therapy is the treatment of choice. The disease is caused by a
spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, which is maintained in nature through an enzootic cycle involving a tick vector
and a variety of vertebrate hosts. Regulation of gene expression in B. burgdorferi in response to environmental
cues prevalent in these highly divergent hosts is critical for pathogen survival and transmission between the
tick vector and vertebrate hosts. Deletion of Borrelia host-adaptation Regulator (BadR) and site-specific
replacement of 8 critical residues of Carbon Storage Regulator A result in dysregulated borrelial strains that
hyper-express a variety of lipoproteins. Purified Borrelial Lipoproteins (PBLs) from these strains confer
protection when administered via parenteral route against challenge with B. burgdorferi infected Ixodes
scapularis nymphs. Consistent with the RFA-AI-19-037 “Targeted Prevention of Tickborne Diseases”, this
proposal is directed at evaluating PBLs from hyper-expression borrelial mutants as a bait-formulation to
develop a reservoir-targeted approach to interrupt the natural history of B. burgdorferi infection using
experimental (C3H/HeN) and reservoir (Peromyscus leucopus, white-footed mouse) mouse models of Lyme
disease. Use of PBLs in their native conformation circumvents the need to express these antigens as
recombinant proteins in heterologous systems or limitations in their reconstitution to reflect their proportions on
the borrelial surface. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that oral administration of PBLs protects
reservoir hosts against Bb challenge via ticks and interferes with the natural history of infection via Ixodes
scapularis ticks. This hypothesis will be tested with 3 specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, correlates of protective
immunity induced by PBLs against B. burgdorferi will be determined. Humoral immune response, levels of
borrelicidal antibodies and levels of protection against B. burgdorferi challenge via ticks induced in C3H/HeN or
P. leucopus mice following oral or parenteral administration of PBLs will be compared. In Specific Aim 2, the
levels of PBL-induced reduction in B. burgdorferi burden in ticks will be determined. The ability of naïve tick
larvae and nymphs fed on PBL-immunized mice to acquire and transmit B. burgdorferi to naïve mice will be
ascertained to establish a strategy to interfere with the natural history of infection. In Specific Aim 3, several
adjuvants and novel strains of B. burgdorferi expressing lipoproteins with properties to increase the potency of
a single dose, oral, reservoir bait vaccine will be evaluated. These studies are novel in exploiting the
components of genetically defined borrelial mutants in conjunction with adjuvants that increase the potency of
PBLs administered as bait formulations to interfere with natural life cycle of Lyme disease pathogen. Overall,
the proposed strategies will help in developing a vaccine platform exploiting genetically modified avirulent
organisms or their components to block one or more tick-borne pathogens."
10889245,"Abstract: Research addressing the causes, diagnosis, and treatment of epilepsy and childhood neurological
disorders, as well as implementation of diagnostic and treatment services, is urgently needed in Africa. The
burden of epilepsy and child neurological disorders in Africa is very high. Neurological syndromes unique to
sub-Saharan Africa have been described, with many more likely awaiting discovery. Currently most children
with treatable neurological disorders in sub-Saharan Africa (e.g., epilepsy) are neither diagnosed nor treated.
Most of the knowledge base childhood neurological disorders is based upon research from North America,
Europe and the Pacific Rim, where the population genomics and environmental causal factors are different from
Africa. Large-scale epidemiology studies, clinical trials, development of diagnostic technologies, and
implementation science research in Africa are required to close this knowledge gap. There are no well-
developed collaboratives of child neurology and epilepsy researchers that cover a large relatively homogenous
population of children in Africa. This project, Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital (AKTH)-Bayero University Kano
(BUK)-Vanderbilt: Developing Future Leaders in Child Neurology and Epilepsy Research (ABV), will build upon
a solid foundation of successful NIH-funded collaborations between Vanderbilt, BUK and AKTH in child
neurology and epilepsy to develop a cadre of physician-scientists in northern Nigeria- a region with a population
of over 100 million people, half of whom are children. Based in Kano, the hub of northern Nigeria, ABV will over
five years provide research training and mentoring for three groups of future research leaders in northern Nigeria:
(1) five ABV Faculty Fellows selected to develop and teach new courses at BUK targeting the needs of future
research leaders in child neurology and epilepsy, under the mentorship of Vanderbilt faculty; (2) eight ABV
Scholars who will complete the MScPH degree at BUK, launching their own research projects co-mentored by
Vanderbilt and AKTH/BUK faculty, and attending the Vanderbilt Institute for Research Development and Ethics,
where they will learn to write, submit and administer their own grants; and, (3) eight ABV Executive Scholars,
mid-career physician-investigators who will devote half-time for up to two years to enhance their skills in an area
of child neurology or epilepsy research, working under a mentor and taking selected courses at BUK . ABV
Scholars and ABV Executive Scholars will be recruited from not only Kano, but also from sister institutions in the
other major cities within northern Nigeria – Zaria, Kaduna, Maiduguri, Katsina, and Sokoto. A yearly Child
Neurology and Epilepsy Congress will be launched in Year 3 as a regional conference highlighting the work of
the ABV Fellows, Scholars, and Executive Scholars, with plans to expand to an Africa-wide conference by Year
5. The ABV alumni will form a collaborative network across northern Nigeria to address critical research needs
in child neurology and epilepsy. Throughout the first five years of the ABV program future principal investigators
of ABV will be mentored as they prepare to renew the ABV D43 funding with all Nigerian principal investigators."

The U.S. faces profound racial and ethnic disparities in hypertension, which are exacerbated by disparities in
medication adherence. Yet few existing medication adherence interventions are tailored to address the specific
cultural beliefs of diverse populations who also face significant structural barriers to adherence associated with
poverty, access to care and food insecurity. The proposed Improving Medication Adherence with Pharmacist
and CHW Team (IMPaCT) intervention responds to the call for adherence interventions that are tailored for the
specific needs of minority racial-ethnic groups. IMPaCT is a practice-based randomized controlled trial (RCT)
to test the effectiveness of a comprehensive, individually- and culturally-tailored intervention for high-risk
patients with hypertension, polypharmacy and low adherence. IMPaCT leverages the specialized expertise of a
clinical pharmacist together with a community health worker (CHW) who will serve as cultural broker and
patient navigator to address individual, clinical, social-cultural, and structural barriers to adherence. This
comprehensive and tailored, coordinated care intervention aims to improve medication adherence and
hypertension outcomes among African-American, Latino and Vietnamese immigrant patients. The proposed
practice-based RCT is designed to meet the following specific aims:
 Aim 1: Implement IMPaCT, an innovative, tailored adherence intervention delivered by a pharmacist and
 CHW team.
 Aim 2: Determine the short- and long-term effectiveness of IMPaCT by assessing pre- to post-intervention
 changes in: a) medication adherence (proximal outcome) and blood pressure (BP, distal outcome), and b)
 other comorbid health outcomes (e.g., HbA1c, BMI) using a randomized controlled trial.
 Aim 3: Identify factors associated with IMPaCT effectiveness including: a) tailored intervention features, b)
 medication beliefs, c) barriers to adherence, d) intervention dose, e) health literacy, and f) cultural group.
We will follow an intention-to-treat randomized design using a waitlist control with 450 African-American,
Latino, and Vietnamese patients with hypertension and low (<80%) medication adherence. Data collection via
pill count, self-report, the electronic health record, and clinical measures will assess medication adherence, BP
and other factors at baseline (pre-intervention) and at 4, 10, and 24 weeks post-intervention. IMPaCT is an
innovative coordinated care team intervention to improve medication adherence and blood pressure derived
from research findings that builds on existing clinical practice. Designed with an eye towards sustainability,
IMPaCT incorporates billable pharmacist and CHW services for patients with low medication adherence and
high burdens of chronic illness and preventable consequences. IMPaCT offers interprofessional team care with
comprehensive expertise and complementary skill sets that mitigate the silo effect of specialized medicine to
deliver primary care to diverse, high-risk populations experiencing disparities in hypertension."
10827386,"Project Summary/Abstract
The ongoing opioid epidemic is among the worst public health crises in United States history, with over 200
people dying daily from opioid overdose. Opioid use and suicide co-occur at an alarmingly high rate, and
despite large-scale efforts, this rate of co-occurrence continues to escalate. Moreover, the co-occurrence of
opioid use and suicide is associated with a wide array of deleterious outcomes, most notably pre-mature death.
Consistent with recent NIDA initiatives, co-occurring opioid use and suicide is receiving growing attention as an
increasingly urgent public health priority. However, empirical examinations in this area continue to lag behind,
with no studies explicating the real-time longitudinal associations between opioid use and acute suicide risk;
this information is needed to inform targeted intervention and policy. Furthermore, it remains unknown how an
individualized trauma context—notably, proximal posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS)—may serve as a
trigger for co-occurring opioid use and acute suicide risk. Understanding the momentary associations among
PTSS, opioid use, and acute suicide risk is necessary for targeted and timely interventions for co-occurring
opioid use and acute suicide risk. This study addresses a critical gap in knowledge by using an ecological
momentary assessment (EMA) approach among 60 trauma-exposed adults who currently use opioids and
report suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs). Specifically, this project will use a novel intensive longitudinal
design to examine the unique influence of trauma context on immediate (acute) risk for co-occurring opioid use
and suicide risk. This project is significant in that the knowledge to be gained via ecologically valid EMA will
specify proximal and context-dependent risk for co-occurring opioid use and suicidality to advance intervention
efforts among this vulnerable trauma-exposed population. It is innovative because it utilizes a cutting-edge
EMA methodology and advanced quantitative methods to delineate the context-dependent nature of the
momentary relations among PTSS, opioid use, and suicide risk, with a focus on personalized statistical models
(idiographic) that can inform individualized treatment. The goal of this F31 is to train the Applicant for
successful independent research using novel intensive longitudinal designs to examine the time-sensitive
associations among PTSS, opioid use, acute suicide risk, with the overarching aim of informing mechanistically
driven, real-time interventions. Thus, this project will provide the Applicant imperative training and experience
in repeated assessment research, sophisticated multi-level analyses, grantsmanship, dissemination of findings,
networking, mentoring, and ethics. The research environment at the University of Rhode Island, including office
space, technology, and grant support, along with excellent Sponsors and Consultants with expertise in relevant
content areas, provide the ideal setting and mentorship to successfully conduct the proposed project."

interactions between any soluble protein of interest and components of a defined metabolite library. We have
validated our approach and shown that this platform, based on equilibrium dialysis, detects known and novel
metabolite-protein interactions with very high sensitivity, independent of specific assays of protein function.
This novel approach is able to discover unappreciated interactions that result in regulation of protein function.

The main objective of this Maximizing Investigators' Research Award (MIRA) is to provide new
mechanistic insight regarding the metabolic stress response to burn trauma. Specifically, the overarching
goal of this research program is to elucidate the role of the mitochondrion in burn-induced
hypermetabolism and metabolic dysfunction. Burns are a leading cause of non-fatal trauma in the United
States. Today, even the most severe burns are survivable. However, burn survivors endure a protracted
recovery, where restoration of function and quality of life are not readily achieved. Accordingly, there is a
pressing need for new strategies that reduce morbidity and hasten the recovery of burn survivors.
Recent data have implicated mitochondria as mediators of the metabolic stress response to burn trauma.
Indeed, altered bioenergetics are thought underlay the hypermetabolic response to burns, and may
contribute to burn-induced insulin resistance, altered lipid metabolism and muscle wasting. Further,
mitochondrial stress appears to impact cellular homeostasis post burn through the formation of oxygen
radicals, and may contribute to the systemic inflammatory response to burns by releasing fragments of
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) into the circulation.
This MIRA will support the development of innovative rodent models of isotopically labeled adipose
tissue and skeletal muscle. These models will be leveraged to trace the turnover, redistribution and
oxidation of specific substrates in response to burn injury. By combining these novel models with
deuterium oxide dosing in vivo, we will generate important data regarding synthesis rates of key
mitochondrial proteins in multiple tissues in response to burn trauma. By dovetailing measurements of
substrate flux and mitochondrial carrier protein turnover with direct measures of mitochondrial respiratory
function, proton leak, membrane potential and superoxide formation, we will elucidate the mechanistic
basis of altered bioenergetics and metabolism in response to burn injury. In addition, the utility of ambient
temperature, protonophores and mitochondrial targeted antioxidants as strategies to restore
bioenergetics and metabolic function post burn will also rigorously tested. Furthermore, blood and tissue
samples collected from burn patients will be used to validate preclinical data and to probe the role of
mtDNA in the systemic inflammatory response to burn injury.
By bettering our mechanistic understanding of the metabolic stress response to burns this research
program will contribute new knowledge that may be leveraged to lessen the suffering and promote the
recovery of burn survivors. Moreover, since hypermetabolism is present in other forms critical illness, the
new information generated by this research program may have broader scientific and clinical impact."
10877906,"ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney (ADPKD) affects an estimated 600,000 individuals in the US and
accounts for 5% of patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). At the current time there is only one
approved therapy available for patients diagnosed with rapidly progressing disease. This underlines the need
for identification of additional measures to slow kidney disease progression in ADPKD patients. Kidney stone
disease is highly prevalent, increasingly common, and associated with considerable comorbidity among
patients affected with ADPKD. In this proposal, we build on our preliminary data which demonstrates that
patients with ADPKD and kidney stone disease have a more rapid loss of kidney function compared to ADPKD
patients without kidney stone disease. We will leverage an interdisciplinary team that is uniquely poised to
define kidney stone disease in ADPKD by combining expertise in large data analytics and high-dimensional
microbiome and metabolomic data. The overall goal of this application is to demonstrate that kidney stone
disease in patients with ADPKD represents a significant risk factor for faster kidney disease progression and
that antibiotic exposure increases stone risk in this population. A secondary goal is to determine how dysbiosis
of the gut microbiome contributes to kidney stone disease. We hypothesize that kidney stone disease
contributes to more rapid decline in kidney function in ADPKD through worsening inflammation and that
antibiotics contribute to kidney stone disease by perturbing the gut-PKD axis through alterations of the gut
microbiome. We test this hypothesis in 3 specific aims. In aim 1, we seek to describe the distribution and
composition of kidney stones by sex and age and to determine the link between kidney stone disease and
decline in kidney function independent of markers of inflammation and other known risk factors for kidney
disease progression. In Aim 2 we investigate the link between antibiotic exposure and kidney stone disease
while in Aim 3 we will define the link between oral antibiotic exposure and change in urinary kidney stone risk
factors resultant from changes in the microbiome. We will leverage the Intermountain Healthcare System
database with medical and pharmacy coverage, and clinical data including stone analysis and the longitudinal
data and samples from the NIDDK sponsored HALT-PKD clinical trials. These resources will provide access to
1,823 patients with ADPKD including 296 with kidney stones. We will recruit 100 patients with ADPKD with or
without antibiotic exposure to facilitate microbiome and stone risk analysis in aim 3. A barrier to developing
new therapies for stone prevention is a lack of understanding of how perturbations of the gut microbiome and
downstream metabolite changes in the intestinal and urinary tracts contributes to kidney stone disease.
Understanding the gut-PKD axis from the proposed studies will introduce a new paradigm for kidney stone
prevention in ADPKD and will provide key insights into novel therapeutic targets for kidney stone disease in
ADPKD."
10884486,"Project 1 Project Summary 
The overall goal of our research is to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underly 
muscular dystrophies in order to facilitate the rational design of novel therapeutic strategies and quantitative 
assays to assess target engagement and the effectiveness of therapeutic approaches. Our current research 
focuses on the dystroglycanopathies, a group of congenital/limb-girdle muscular dystrophies caused by 
defects in post-translational processing of the extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor α-dystroglycan (α-DG). 
ECM proteins that contain laminin-G-like (LG) domains bind to α-DG via a unique heteropolysaccharide 
[-GlcA-β1,3-Xyl-α1,3-]n called matriglycan. Genetic studies have shown that mutations in any one of at least 
eighteen genes encoding enzymes required for α-DG post-translational processing lead to the absence of 
or a reduction in matriglycan and thus impair α-DG receptor function. Although significant progress has 
been made in the identification and characterization of dystroglycanopathy genes, we still do not fully 
understand the biochemical and physiological function of matriglycan, or how its absence or reduction in 
length causes muscular dystrophy. The overall objective of the proposed research is to provide mechanistic 
insights into the role matriglycan plays in α-DG receptor function and in the pathophysiology of the 
dystroglycanopathies. The overarching hypothesis of our research is that a thorough understanding of (a) 
the shortened matriglycan structure and resulting α-DG receptor dysfunction in dystroglycanopathy patients 
and (b) the mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of the dystroglycanopathies, will lead to more 
reliable diagnostics and novel therapeutic strategies. Specific Aim 1 will establish the relationship between 
α-DG matriglycan length and laminin-binding properties of matriglycan on α-DG in control and 
dystroglycanopathy patient fibroblasts and muscle biopsies. These studies will reveal abnormalities in the 
post-translational processing of α-DG that result in shorter matriglycan with reduced affinity for laminin 
leading to muscular dystrophy. Specific Aim 2 will define the biochemical regulation of matriglycan synthesis 
and its role in the receptor function of α-DG. These studies will define the requirements for matriglycan 
synthesis and how its synthesis is regulated by protein-protein and protein-sugar interactions. Specific Aim 
3 will define novel mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of the dystroglycanopathies and determine 
the structure and laminin binding properties required to improve muscle function. These studies will use 
myd mice with established dystrophic muscle pathology that are evaluated before and after LARGE gene 
transfer. Collectively, these aims will provide an understanding of the pathological mechanisms underlying 
dystroglycanopathies, which will be needed to develop a rationale for the design of novel diagnostic and 
therapeutic strategies, as well as approaches to monitoring therapeutic engagement and efficacy."

10873341,"The Boston University Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center Clinical Core (BU ADRC CC) facilitates and
conducts cutting-edge research on AD and AD related dementias (ADRDs), including chronic traumatic
encephalopathy (CTE). CC participants, and biospecimens and data generated from their participation, support
local efforts, cross-ADRC collaborations and national research initiatives. CC investigators are engaged in
AD/ADRD research towards several National Alzheimer’s Project Act (NAPA) goals, including population studies,
precision medicine, health disparities, biomarkers, diagnosis, mechanisms, and translational and clinical
research. The Center is closely integrated and synergistic with the Framingham Heart Study at BU. Research
by CC investigators has led to fundamental insights into the role of repetitive head impacts (RHI) from contact
sport participation, military service and physical violence in the pathogenesis of AD/ADRD, including CTE.
However, CTE cannot be diagnosed during life due to an ill-defined clinical presentation and lack of validated
biomarkers. Research has been limited by cross-sectional studies of small samples of male former elite American
football players and reliance on retrospective informant reports. To address these knowledge gaps, we expanded
our CC in 2018 to integrate participants with exposure to RHI (men and women, across different types of sports
and levels of play). This integration is highly aligned with the Center-wide theme to study the late effects of RHI
and compare AD, CTE and other ADRDs, vis-à-vis clinical presentation, biomarker profile, genetic and other
risks factors, and clinical-pathological correlations. In Aim 1, we will sustain, augment, and characterize the
clinical phenotypes and trajectories of an established CC Cohort (CCC). The CCC is comprised of 400
participants, that are >50 years, demographically diverse, representative of Greater Boston and that span the
cognitive spectrum. We will collaborate with the Outreach, Recruitment and Engagement Core to continue
recruitment of traditional CC participants and expand the number with RHI exposure. We will characterize the
neurological, neuropsychological, neuropsychiatric and diagnostic profiles using traditional and novel
phenotyping approaches, including digital phenotyping. We will obtain brain donation consent of CC participants
and work with the Neuropathology Core to facilitate brain donation. In Aim 2, we will obtain brain imaging,
biospecimens and novel biomarkers from the CCC and work with the Data Management & Statistics, Biomarker,
and Genomics and Molecular Profiling Cores to integrate biomarker collection, analysis, banking, and
distribution. In Aim 3, we will share data and provide a source of well-characterized participants for local and
national research studies on AD and ADRD, including CTE. In Aim 4, we will educate trainees to develop the
next generation of AD/ADRD clinical investigators. In conclusion, the CC plays a central role in the BU ADRC by
engaging research participants and driving activities that reflect the Center’s overall themes, as well as
advancing the priorities identified in NAPA recommendations."

10887621,"Summary: Upon cellular death, cells release damaged mitochondria, contributing to local
inflammation. The overall aims of the present study are to investigate how mitochondria are
cleared to avoid evoking an aberrant immune response, and to determine if autoantibodies
targeting mitochondrial proteins have clinical utility in assessing development of thrombosis in
patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The premise of the study is that SLE patients
have impaired clearance of mitochondria, promoting development of mitochondrial antibodies,
inflammation and organ damage, including thrombosis. To investigate this we have three main
aims. The first aim investigates how mitochondrial extrusion promotes autoimmunity towards
mitochondrial protein antigens, attempting to define the exact target of novel main mitochondrial
autoantibody, AMA-17, the processes involved in exposing the autoantigen in vitro, as well as
potential therapeutic targets, e.g. mitochondrial ROS, involved in generating AMA-17 in vivo.
The second aim investigates how anti-mitochondrial antibodies partake in thrombosis
development. Using a large longitudinal SLE cohort (n=500), followed over 10 years, we will
determine the capacity of AMA-17 to associate with and/or predict development of venous
thrombosis. Affinity-purified AMA-17 antibodies will be tested for platelet activation and
thrombus formation in vitro using flow cytometry, aggregometry and a cutting-edge model of
engineered microvessels, as well as in vivo using a novel model of antibody-mediated venous
thrombosis developed by Dr. Knight. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate underlying
mechanisms involved in clearance of mitochondria, with an emphasis on the role of complement
C1q and C3 to facilitate silent clearance. These studies will be done both in vitro using select
isolated complement components, as well as in vivo using unique C1q and C3 deficient mice.
Outcome measures include phagocytosis, cytokine production, and NET formation.
Downstream signaling pathways involved in mitochondrial-mediated inflammation will be
identified using mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics. In all, our study aims at
identifying fundamental mechanisms regulating inflammation, thrombosis and autoimmunity in
the context of human disease, with an emphasis on the role of the complement system in silent
removal of mitochondria. We expect the proposed research to provide novel therapeutic targets
disrupting the inflammatory and immunogenic properties of mitochondria, applicable for many
diseases, including SLE and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as identify prognostic mitochondrial-
derived biomarkers enabling early and preventive treatment of venous thrombosis."
10866491,"Abstract
Glycolysis constitutes one of the most important metabolic pathways conserved in both eukaryotes and
prokaryotes. In the pathway, glucose is broken down to form small 3-carbon phosphate metabolites essential for
cell growth and survival. In microorganisms, properly maintaining glycolysis is important for the development of
bacterial infection and virulence and antibiotic resistance. In this project, we aim to study the structure and
function of phosphatidylglycerol phosphatase PgpA to elucidate a novel regulatory mechanism of glycolysis in
bacterium. PgpA is an integral membrane protein ubiquitously found in Gram-negative bacterium. We found that
PgpA functions as a moonlighting enzyme; i.e. PgpA is not only involved in phospholipid biosynthesis but also
acts as an essential metabolic regulator by hydrolyzing the key 3-carbon phosphate glycolytic metabolites in E.
coli. Mutational inactivation of PgpA in E. coli greatly facilitates bacterial metabolism and growth. We have also
identified a novel redox-regulatory mechanism of PgpA, which is important to maintain bacterial metabolic
homeostasis. Our findings raise the hypothesis for a redox-mediated regulatory mechanism in which PgpA
regulates bacterial glycolysis by controlling glutathione-mediated redox balance based on external and internal
metabolic signals. This regulatory mechanism is novel and has not yet been reported in any cell type. To further
understand this regulatory mechanism, we will study how PgpA controls bacterial glucose uptake and regulate
glycolytic activity using a combination of biochemistry, microbiology, and metabolomic approaches.To
understand how PgpA regulates intracellular redox balance, we will examine glutathione biosynthesis and
monitor redox changes on the membrane surface of PgpA to demonstrate how PgpA uses an integrative “Ying-
Yang” mechanism to achieve both metabolic homeostasis and redox balance. We also found the redox-mediated
regulation of PgpA is mediated by dimeric disulfide crosslinking within PgpA dimer. To gain structural insights
into this novel redox-regulated catalytic mechanism, we will study the catalytic activity of PgpA and co-factor
Mg2+ binding in response to redox changes in vitro using biochemical assays. We will also study this molecular
mechanism using FRET to demonstrate how dimeric crosslinking alters protein conformation to allosterically
change the active site conformation in order to control the PgpA catalysis. Since no structure is available in the
PgpA family, we will determine the structures of PgpA in two distinct redox (active/inactivated) states using the
X-ray crystallography and single-particle cryoEM approaches to establish a structural basis for the redox-
regulated catalytic mechanism of PgpA. This mechanism is conserved in many Gram-negative pathogens. Our
studies will reveal an important mechanism to understand metabolic regulation in microorganisms."
10877034,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Light-induced isomerization of 11-cis retinal, the chromophore of visual pigments, to all-trans retinal
initiates vision. Efficient recycling of 11-cis retinal through the visual cycle is essential for the formation of visual
pigments and maintaining normal vision. A key step in the visual cycle is the conversion of all-trans retinyl ester
to 11-cis retinol, catalyzed by RPE65, the retinol isomerase. Documented studies have shown that retinoids are
largely stored as all-trans retinyl ester, the substrate of the isomerase RPE65, in lipid droplets (retinosomes) in
the RPE. However, RPE65 is located in the ER and not near the lipid droplets. It is unknown how hydrophobic
all-trans retinyl ester, the substrate of RPE65, is transported from lipid droplets to the ER. This represents an
important knowledge gap in the visual cycle. A retinyl ester hydrolase (REH) may be present in lipid droplets to
mobilize all-trans retinyl ester to provide the substrate for the RPE65 isomerase in the ER. Patatine-like
phospholipase domain containing protein 2 (PNPLA2) is known as an adipose triglyceride lipase with an REH
activity in the liver. Its function in the RPE and its association with the visual cycle have not been investigated.
Our preliminary studies identified PNPLA2 in the RPE and in lipid droplets. Importantly, PNPLA2-/- mice showed
declined ERG responses and delayed regeneration of visual pigments. PNPLA2 KO also resulted in reduced
11-cis retinal generation and increased levels of all-trans retinyl ester in the RPE, suggesting a decreased
isomerase activity. These findings suggest a potential role of PNPLA2 in the visual cycle. We hypothesize that
PNPLA2 functions as an REH in the RPE and mobilizes all-trans retinyl ester from lipid droplets to provide
sufficient substrate for the RPE65 isomerase in the ER to generate 11-cis retinol. In this project, we will define
the role of PNPLA2 in maintaining the visual cycle and normal vision. We will use RPE-specific PNPLA2
conditional KO mice to study the impacts of PNPLA2 KO on retinal function, retinal degeneration, visual pigment
formation and regeneration of 11-cis retinal. We also plan to determine if co-expression of PNPLA2 together with
RPE65 in the RPE of RPE65-/- mice by gene delivery will enhance the effect of RPE65 on restoring visual
function, visual pigment formation and 11-cis retinal regeneration, compared to RPE65 gene delivery alone. We
will also elucidate the mechanism by which PNPLA2 promotes the RPE65 isomerase activity and accelerates
11-cis retinal regeneration in the visual cycle. We will investigate if knockout of PNPLA2 in RPE cells will
decrease, while overexpression of PNPLA2 will promote, isomerase activity of RPE65 and reduce lipid droplets
in RPE cells. We will also determine if a PNPLA2 activator will promote, while a PNPLA2 inhibitor will inhibit the
isomerase activity in RPE cells. These studies have potential to identify a missing component in the visual cycle
and address an important knowledge gap in vision. This project will also identify a new function of PNPLA2 in
the RPE. PNPLA2 has potential to improve the RPE65 gene therapy for retinal dystrophies caused by RPE65
mutations."
10794394,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Obesity is a major contributor to the epidemic of metabolic diseases including type II diabetes, hypertension,
cardiovascular disease, and liver disease. Excess weight gain is the result of a chronic imbalance between
caloric intake and energy expenditure, and while several pharmacological agents target energy intake to promote
body weight loss, no current options are successful in the long-term management of obesity. Thus, a greater
understanding of the central mechanisms that contribute to obesity are required for both its prevention and
treatment. Numerous studies have implicated mitochondrial dysfunction in neurons because of excess
consumption of nutrients in the pathogenesis of obesity. Previous publications have demonstrated that the inner
mitochondrial membrane protein uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), renowned for its role in heat production in
thermogenic adipose tissue, is also expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), however, the function of
neuronal UCP1 is completely unknown. Our preliminary data unexpectedly demonstrates that UCP1 is
expressed in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) of adult mice and that its expression is metabolically
regulated. Consequently, there is a need to understand how UCP1 functions and whether it’s activation within
the CNS can also regulate energy homeostasis as it does in brown adipose tissue. The next steps addressing
these needs are to pursue the overall objective of this application: (i) determine the extent to which UCP1 in
the VMH influences energy balance, and (ii) investigate if neuronal UCP1 activity attenuates the production of
reactive oxygen species (ROS) to regulate energy homeostasis. We will investigate our central hypothesis that
activation of UCP1 within the VMH chronically reduces ROS to promote negative energy balance. We will test
our hypothesis using novel genetic mouse models and viral vector constructs that knockout or overexpress UCP1
specifically in the VMH to determine whether modulation of neuronal UCP1 activity regulates body weight
following cold exposure or consumption of high fat diet. Moreover, we will be able to investigate whether UCP1
in the VMH can chronically reduce ROS to regulate energy homeostasis, as well as determine how modulating
its expression regulates mitochondrial dynamics. The experiments proposed in this application are expected to
identify novel signaling pathways that provide new insights into the treatment and prevention of obesity.
Rationale for this project is that discovering the function of central UCP1 may contribute to future discovery
efforts to identify and test new therapeutic targets to treat obesity. In addition, an outlined career development
plan to elevate my knowledge of mitochondrial biology by leveraging mentorships, technical training, seminars,
conferences, and R01 workshops is described in the application. The University of Iowa has committed its
support and facilities to allow Dr. Claflin to complete the proposed research and participate in their extensive
training seminars. Completion of the proposed 5-year research and training plans will prepare Dr. Claflin for an
independent research career and assist in securing an R01 from the NIDDK."

An estimated 10% of Americans suffer from autoimmune disease, and the vast majority of those affected are
women. This application proposes a five-year mentored career development and research plan for a physician
scientist to establish a niche in the field of skin immunology focused on autoimmune diseases such as systemic
lupus erythematosus that disproportionately affect women. By investigating the biological mechanisms that lead
to this sex bias, the candidate seeks to find new avenues to treat and potentially prevent these devastating
diseases. The candidate has demonstrated commitment to research throughout her training and is poised for a
career in academic medicine. This award will facilitate the training required to achieve her long-term career goals:
(1) Establish herself as an independent investigator and national leader in academic dermatology, with a career
focused on cutaneous immunology, (2) Establish a programmatic line of funded research to improve
understanding of cutaneous immunology and identify new therapeutic targets in female-biased autoimmune
disease, and (3) Learn to provide dedicated mentorship to foster career development of trainees at all levels.
Career development plan: Through formal coursework, didactic seminars, and hands-on training from mentors
and their lab personnel, the candidate will attain the scientific and career development training needed to achieve
these goals. She proposes to acquire specific scientific skills in systems biology applications, mouse modeling
of complex human disease, and approaches for study of cutaneous and systemic immunology. Simultaneously,
she will pursue her career development goals of integrating with the scientific community, enhancing leadership
and mentoring skills, and acquiring practical skills for the ethical conduct of translational research.

determining how the female-biased factor VGLL3 drives autoimmune disease in the skin of women. AIM 1 will
define how VGLL3 interacts with transcription factors to promote autoimmunity by integrating human cell culture
and transgenic mouse studies with a systems biology approach. AIM 2 will use proteomics data and validation
by siRNA-mediated knockdown to identify factors governing VGLL3 activity in human skin cells from patients of
both sexes with and without lupus. AIM 3 will determine how VGLL3 interfaces with the oncogene YAP in driving
autoimmunity and test a potential therapy in lupus patient skin cells and mice with lupus-like disease."
10894709,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) comprise a range of effects resulting from prenatal alcohol
exposure (PAE) including neurological abnormalities, cognitive and behavioral impairments, growth
retardation, and craniofacial anomalies. Few treatments have been investigated despite FASD’s
tremendous public health burden. Cognitive deficits are a core feature of FASD, and cognition is a
natural target for intervention. One potential intervention for cognition in FASD is the essential
nutrient choline - known to have effects on brain development and cognition. In the hippocampus,
choline contributes to increased dendritic arborization, larger cells, and functional changes. Choline
affects the cholinergic system and alters brain structure and function in regions essential for memory
functioning, including methylation in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Only a handful of human
choline studies for FASD have been undertaken and our group has conducted most of them. Our
early double-blind, randomized, controlled trial established safety and tolerability. Our subsequent
trial revealed beneficial effects for sequential delayed memory in participants with FASD (greater in
younger [ages 2-3] rather than older [ages 3-5] children). Our third (ongoing) study included a long-
term follow-up that demonstrated long-term benefits for choline vs. placebo in non-verbal processing,
working memory, long-term verbal memory, and ADHD behavior. The proposed studies will include a
new clinical trial with a new cohort of 2-5 year old children with FASD. Rather than a placebo-
controlled trial, it will be a two-arm block-randomized study with cumulative choline exposure
durations of 3 or 6 months. Results will directly inform future clinical implementation of choline as a
neurodevelopmental intervention. The proposed studies will also capitalize on three existing cohorts
for additional longitudinal studies that will determine durability of effects from early treatment. A 4-
year and 8-year follow-up study will each examine cognitive effects as well as structural and
functional brain effects using advanced MRI methods. Cognitive measures will include the Stanford-
Binet Intelligence Scale, the Elicited Imitation memory test, the NIH Toolbox Flanker test and Picture
Sequence Memory Test, and the Minnesota Executive Function Scale. We will examine choline
effects on behavior using parent-report (CBCL) and a structured diagnostic interview (KSADS).
Select hippocampal sub-fields will be examined for volumetric improvements following choline or
placebo. Functional connectivity will be examined and is expected to reflect changes from early
choline supplementation. We will also use cortical myelin mapping to evaluate choline’s effect on
long-term myelin development. In addition, we will apply diffusion-weighted imaging to determine
choline’s effect on white matter microstructure – which is known to be disrupted in FASD."

The primary goal of this study is to construct predictive models (classifiers) of pulmonary sarcoidosis and
progressive (P) vs. non-progressive (NP) disease that will ultimately serve to improve outcomes of pulmonary
sarcoidosis. We have assembled a unique investigative team with expertise in proteomics, immunology,
genomics, sarcoidosis clinical care, as well as bioinformatics and statistics. Sarcoidosis is a diagnostically
challenging immune-mediated systemic disease. It results in significant morbidity and mortality, primarily due to
progressive pulmonary disease, although the factors that drive pulmonary disease and P vs. NP disease are
unknown. The strategies to treat pulmonary sarcoidosis, including the triggers to initiate treatment, are non-
specific; treatment usually relies on suppressing the immune system with corticosteroids and is associated with
considerable side-effects. Transcriptional changes in the lung and blood have defined a signature of P disease
in cross-sectional studies. Since proteins are the main effectors of cellular function and their alterations result in
disruption of biologic systems and disease development, they are a logical source of biomarkers. Our preliminary
data from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cells demonstrate significant proteome wide alterations in pulmonary
sarcoidosis vs controls and P vs NP disease. We hypothesize that effective markers of disease and those
distinguishing progressive from non-progressive disease will reflect biological processes active in
disease and progression. Secondarily, by characterizing cellular proteins, global phosphorylation events and
cell-specific RNA expression, we will define known proteins/gene/pathways such as the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and
other serine-threonine kinase signaling mechanisms as well as novel pathogenic proteins/genes, such as
endocytic and aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling, which will have implications for mechanism and therapy. We
will use high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS), advanced bioinformatics and computational tools in well-
phenotyped sarcoidosis patients. In Aim 1, we will determine a disease-specific classifier for diagnosing
sarcoidosis using a Discovery Cohort of sarcoidosis cases and diseased and healthy controls (already recruited)
for the development and Validation Cohort (recruited for this study) of sarcoidosis cases and controls to verify
and optimize the classifier performance. In Aim 2, we will identify a protein classifier of P vs NP disease using
the same approach as in Aim 2. In Aim 3 we will use a novel single-cell RNA-sequencing approach, CITE-seq
to identify transcription from specific cells, and integrate it with protein changes, including examination of global
phosphorylation events to identify kinase signaling and discover cell-specific cellular proteins/genes associated
with disease and progression in a subset of our Validation Cohort. At the end of this study, we will have defined
diagnostic biomarkers of disease and progression that can be translated easily to the clinic. We will also gain
insights into the sarcoidosis pulmonary proteins and transcripts that may serve as potential therapeutic targets
and provide potential mechanistic information with future study."

Despite robust evidence that (a) depression rises precipitously during adolescence, (b) mental health during
adolescence predicts lifelong trajectories, and (c) meditation-based interventions (MBIs) reduce depressive
symptoms, access to and research on MBIs in adolescent populations is limited. Mobile health (mHealth)
delivery of MBIs offers the promise of accessibility, affordability, and personalization. Research on mHealth
MBIs in adults indicates these programs are feasible, acceptable, safe, and effective in reducing depressive
symptoms. Coupled with advances in ambulatory assessment of behavior and psychophysiology (i.e., personal
sensing data) through wearable devices, mHealth and personal sensing data represent a new frontier in
intervention research and mental health care. Although mHealth technologies are ubiquitous for today’s
adolescents, there is virtually no research on mHealth MBIs in adolescents and no research integrating
mHealth MBI delivery with personal sensing data. The proposed Career Development Award begins to
address this knowledge gap by developing the candidate’s skills to conduct research involving clinical
adolescent samples, personal sensing data, and advanced mediation methods to identify mechanisms of
change. This new training will be leveraged to study, in a sample of 150 adolescents with elevated depressive
symptoms, the impact of a mHealth MBI that has strong preliminary evidence of efficacy. Participants will be
randomly assigned to the mHealth MBI or to a wait-list control condition. Aim 1 will assess the feasibility,
acceptability, and safety of the 8-week mHealth MBI in depressed adolescents. Aim 2 will preliminarily assess
program efficacy in reducing depressive symptoms. Aim 3 will characterize psychological (i.e., perseverative
thinking, cognitive distancing, loneliness), behavioral (i.e., social isolation via geolocation data), and
psychophysiological (i.e., sleep quality and heart rate metrics via wearable) mediator effects on depressive
symptoms using advanced structural equation modeling methods. These methods will provide preliminary
evidence of intervention efficacy while potentially identifying mechanisms of change at multiple levels of
analysis, providing critical data for planning future, large-scale randomized controlled trials. All aims will be
supported by didactic, experiential, and mentored training in the fundamentals of clinical research through the
NIH-funded Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR) and the Center for Healthy Minds. Aim 3
will be facilitated by new training in personal sensing data and advanced mediation methods, supported by a
mentor team with extensive expertise in these domains. Combined, the research aims and training goals of this
project seek to promote the development of accessible, acceptable, safe, and effective mHealth MBIs for the
treatment and ultimately prevention of adolescent depression. This award will enable the candidate to conduct
future intervention and mechanism research aimed at reducing the burden of depression in adolescents."
10824361,"Project Abstract/Summary
Hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (HDP) is a major public health problem especially postpartum. Postpartum
hypertension (HTN) accounts for nearly 75% of maternal hemorrhagic strokes, heart failures, and deaths, one-
third of which occurs in the first week after birth. Patients who survive these devastating complications face a
lifelong sequela of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The mechanisms behind the increased risk of CVD involve
vascular dysfunction generated by HDP and further exacerbated by postpartum HTN. Currently, postpartum
antihypertensive treatment is recommended only for severe HTN (≥160/≥110 mmHg). There are no guidelines
regarding treatment of mild HTN, defined as blood pressures (BP) of 140s-150s/90s-100s mmHg. Consequently,
initiation of antihypertensive medications postpartum for mild HTN is at a provider’s discretion with a wide
variation in practice. Given the prevalence and morbidity of postpartum HTN and limited research focused on
how tight to control postpartum BP, it is critical to generate evidence to guide best practices for management of
postpartum HTN. Our central hypothesis is that continuous exposure to HTN postpartum is a key driving factor
for short-term complications of HDP and long-term risk of CVD. The overall objective of our work is to test the
hypothesis that intensive BP control coupled with healthy lifestyle education can improve maternal
cardiovascular health (CVH) and accelerate recovery of vascular function by limiting exposure to HTN through
a large multisite randomized controlled trial (RCT). Given the complexities of conducting an RCT of this nature,
the overall objective of this R34, titled “Intensive Postpartum Antihypertensive Treatment to Improve
Women’s Cardiovascular Health” (IPAT) is to pilot test an RCT of pharmacological therapy for 6 weeks
postpartum and healthy lifestyle education through 1 year postpartum among 60 patients with HDP. We will
determine IPAT feasibility and its potential to ameliorate CVD risk following HDP. The IPAT will randomize 60
postpartum patients with HDP to intensive BP control versus usual care. Both groups will receive healthy lifestyle
education on American Heart Association’s Life’s Essential 8 (LE8) CVH metrics and DASH diet by a registered
dietician and a life coach. All participants will undergo vascular function assessment: endothelial dysfunction with
brachial artery flow mediated dilation, arterial stiffness with carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, and collection of
an HDP-related biomarker of endothelial damage, soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1, at baseline (after delivery),
6 weeks, and 12 months postpartum. Aim 1 will test feasibility of all study procedures, including recruitment,
retention, and adherence. Aim 2 will examine changes in BP and in LE8 CVH score from baseline to 12 months
postpartum. Aim 3 will determine which vascular biomarker would be most reflective of BP control in the
postpartum period. This pilot study is significant because it will answer important questions that are necessary
and sufficient to establish operational feasibility and design of the larger trial that will generate evidence to guide
best practices for management of postpartum HTN."

Development and Validation of a Marmoset Model of Late-Onset Alzheimer’s Disease Based on Tau Seeding
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
 Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, currently afflicts 5.8 million Americans. By
2050, the number of people with AD could reach nearly 14 million. Histopathologically, AD is characterized by
the formation of extracellular aggregates (plaques) of beta-amyloid (Aβ) protein fragments and intracellular
aggregates (neurofibrillary tangles, NFTs) of a hyperphosphorylated form of the microtubule-associated protein
tau (MAPT). Increasing evidence indicates that both Aβ plaques and NFTs begin to accumulate in the brain
decades before symptoms emerge. The long delay between Aβ and tau manifestation and the onset of
memory loss and cognitive decline in AD makes it difficult to properly model AD using short-lived animal
models, such as mice. As age and genetic variation are two of the most significant risk factors for AD, there is
a critical need to develop improved animal models of AD that incorporate genetic variability, aging, and higher-
order cognitive processes that better align with humans. The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small
non-human primate (NHP) ideally poised to fill this need. They display social and cognitive behaviors that are
more similar to those of humans. Marmosets live on average 12-13 years and are considered aged at eight
years. Aβ plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau occur naturally in the brain of aging marmosets. Developing
strategies to accelerate the onset of cognitive decline related to the presence of pathological hallmarks of AD
in marmosets would lead to establishing an NHP model with improved translational potential relative to rodent
models. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop and validate an induced marmoset model of late-onset
AD. Converging clinical data indicates that the severity of cognitive impairment in sporadic AD correlates best
with the burden of NFTs. We hypothesize that injecting the brain of aging marmosets with tau will seed the
formation and propagation of NFTs and accelerate the emergence of impairments in a spectrum of AD-related
sensory, motor, cognitive and non-cognitive phenotypes associated with disease progression. We will test this
hypothesis in two aims. In Aim 1, we will use neuronal cell cultures derived from aging marmosets to quantify
the spontaneous presence of AD-related pathology in vitro and evaluate the efficacy of tau seeding strategies
in accelerating the development of NFTs and promoting neurodegeneration and cell death. In Aim 2, we will
seed the brains of aging marmosets with tau, and perform a comprehensive longitudinal evaluation of
functional, behavioral, and clinical biomarkers of AD in the tau-seeded marmosets. This work will lead to the
establishment of a validated NHP model of late-onset AD that will be invaluable in translational research to
elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms of AD and contribute to developing new therapeutics for AD."

Atlantic Health Cancer Consortium Community Oncology Research Program (AHCC-CORP) is the first
NCORP Community Site within the state of New Jersey and combines the collective strengths of world-class
healthcare systems with community oncology care delivery. AHCC-CORP covers a geographically and
demographically diverse area representing 73% of New Jersey’s population. AHCC-CORP expands the
NCORP network by 6.5M people; with a higher cancer incidence rate than the US as a whole (477.5 vs 441.2
cases per 100,000). Regions of AHCC-CORP are even further elevated.
Specific Aims include: ​1) Increase adult and pediatric accruals to NCI cancer prevention, control,
screening, and care delivery research studies, as well as treatment and imaging studies conducted by
the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) and biospecimen collection​. ​This will be accomplished by
creating a unique and unprecedented cancer care consortium in New Jersey​. ​The Consortium has experienced
cancer investigators in adult and pediatric cancers across multiple sites, including three children's hospitals.
Separately, Consortium sites annually accrue an average of 130 ​participants to NCORP Research Bases, but
with the leadership and infrastructure support of AHCC-CORP, affiliates are now poised to even further
increase accruals. ​2) Enhance community engagement in ​cancer control and prevention clinical trials
and Cancer Care Delivery Research (CCDR) conducted by NCORP ​in the AHCC-CORP ​catchment area.
Engagement will be enhanced through innovative approaches that effectively engage physicians, patients, and
the community. Developments ​notably include video vignettes for social media dissemination and interactive
chatbot capabilities powered by natural language processing, allowing recruitment/retention strategies in
multiple languages in support of cancer disparities integration. Additionally, AHCC-CORP ​has a clearly-defined
process for prioritizing NCORP and NCTN trials for activation, and procedures in support of successful study
accrual and data collection across sites.​ AHCC-CORP will also support and mentor community oncologists and
other medical specialists in central and northern New Jersey​, furthering capabilities in cancer care delivery
research. ​3) Contribute to the development and implementation of clinically significant studies that
incorporate the unique research needs of the diverse population within the AHCC NCORP catchment
area, leveraging the expertise of established oncology specialty physicians and other providers within
our affiliate network. ​The established clinical and research expertise, across multiple tumor types and
research modalities, of AHCC-CORP physicians and other providers will be leveraged to support NCORP
overarching programmatic goals through ​active involvement in Research Bases and other NCORP-wide
research leadership committees."
10911800,"The innate immune system deploys various pattern-recognition receptors, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), to recognize the invasion of microbes and initiate protective responses. TLRs are expressed at the cell surface or intracellular compartments (e.g., endosome and lysosome) in various cell types, such as macrophages, and recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns. Ligand recognition by TLRs initiates signal transduction pathways that culminate in the activation of transcription factors such as NF-kappaB, resulting in production of cytokines and chemokines to protect the host. A subset of TLRs recognizes nucleic acids as their ligands, and nucleic acids from bacteria, viruses, and fungi have been extensively investigated as TLR stimulators to induce the innate immune responses. Endosomal TLR7 and -8 recognize single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs) as their ligands. In addition to foreign ssRNAs from bacteria or viruses, endogenous self- ssRNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) in host cells, have been shown to activate TLR7 and -8. However, in contrast to extensive research on foreign ssRNAs, those endogenous ssRNA ligands of ssRNA-sensing TLRs have not been fully elucidated, representing significant scientific knowledge gaps. We propose that many short non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) remain to be discovered as endogenous ssRNA ligands for TLR7 and -8. The knowledge gaps partly result from technical limitations of standard RNA-seq that is unable to capture all RNA species expressed in the cells and tissues. For example, the RNAs containing a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate (cP) at the 3′-ends cannot be ligated to a 3′-adapter and thus cannot be amplified and sequenced in standard RNA-seq procedure, forming hidden components of the transcriptome. Despite the “invisible” nature, functional significance of the cP-containing RNA (cP-RNAs) derived from tRNAs and rRNAs have been increasingly apparent in various human diseases including infectious diseases. Our lab has developed “cP-RNA-seq” which can specifically sequence cP-RNAs. In preliminary studies, our cP-RNA-seq identified numerous, abundant tRNA- or rRNA-derived sncRNAs accumulated upon infection of Mycobacterium bovis BCG and accompanying surface TLR activation in human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDMs), allowing us to observe infection- induced sncRNAs that have never been recognized and characterized previously. Importantly, those sncRNAs are abundantly accumulated not only in HMDMs but also in their secreted extracellular vehicles (EVs), and some specific scnRNAs, such as a 5′-tRNAHisGUG half, have activity to stimulate endosomal TLR7 or -8 when delivered to endosomes of recipient cells. Our further preliminary results showed a large increase of the levels of these sncRNAs in plasma samples of patients infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). These results have led us to hypothesize that endogenous sncRNAs function as integral elements in the innate immune response by activating ssRNA-sensing TLRs, and we propose to characterize infection-induced sncRNAs in plasma of Mtb- infected patients (Aim 1) and to investigate their activity in endosomal TLR stimulation (Aim 2)."
10846606,"Nitric oxide (NO) plays critical roles in a myriad of cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating physiology
and function of various organs and systems. Depletion of NO and its reduced bioavailability contributes to the
pathology of several human diseases including anemia, malaria, heart failure, obesity, diabetes and
neurodegeneration. Recent reports suggest that oral microbiota regulate NO homeostasis through the action of
some bacteria that have the ability to perform reduction of the nutrient anion nitrate to nitrite and NO. Several
clinical trials have taken advantage of this nitrate-nitrite-NO cycle employing oral nitrate to deliver NO.
However, many individuals do not respond to oral nitrate, and we hypothesize that this is due to a deficiency in
nitrate to nitrite converting bacteria. Hence, developing microbiome modulators like probiotics to enhance
and/or perform increased nitrate reduction and NO formation can potentially serve as a solution to recover
diminished NO levels and bioavailability. The goal of this project is to test the role of oral bacteria in
determining the extent of conversion of oral nitrate to plasma nitrite while developing novel human-origin
probiotics of nitrate-nitrite-NO formation abilities and determine their adherence potential to colonize and form
biofilms in epithelia. In Aim 1 we will use novel, high throughput screening assays to identify candidate
bacterial strains with efficient nitrate to nitrite conversion abilities obtained from the oral cavity and characterize
these strains. In Aim 2 we will determine the oral cavity colonizing capabilities of the nitrate to nitrite converting
bacterial strains. In Aim 3, we will test the role of these bacterial strains’ in determining the extent of
conversion of oral nitrate to plasma nitrite in a murine model. Successful completion of these studies could
lead to probiotics against human diseases caused by NO homeostasis abrogation."

Renewal of my Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research (K24) will allow me to continue my strong efforts
directed toward successful original investigations and mentoring to generate research capacity in mobile technologies to
improve health (mHealth). The impact of the initial K24 on my mentees has been striking. Since award of the initial K24,
nearly two dozen of my mentees, 70% of whom are women or minorities, have been PI on NIH funded studies (under K, R,
or Loan Repayment Program mechanisms). The impact the K24 on my own research has been substantial. Since 2014, I
have been Principal Investigator (PI) on six federally funded awards: 1) one newly funded 4-year R01 from NIDA; 2) one R56
from NIDA; 3) one two-year R01 from NIDA; 4) one 4-year R01 from NIDA; 5) my K24 from NIDA; and 6) one newly funded
4-year DARPA research award. In addition, I received a William J Fulbright Foreign Scholarship to Malaysia. As my K24
evolved, so has my research focus. My overall research objective is to devote sufficient time to investigate use of next
generation (“NextGen”) technologies, invisible biosensing, and machine learning in substance abuse and HIV research. My
first research project, Virya, uses “digital phenotyping” with invisible biosensing and machine learning, to identify acute pain
exacerbations in HIV+ individuals on opioids, a population at risk for problematic opioid use. The second reseach project
uses mobile technologies to diagnose Covid-19 infection in HIV+ persons who inhale cannabis, itself a high-impact topic.
Finally, the R01-funded MyTPill project compares the NextGen technology of unobtrusive ingestible biosensors that provide
vivid, indisputable measures of medication ingestion. NextGen research discoveries become commercial products, but this
process of introducing new discoveries into the healthcare economy remains deeply unfamiliar—yet increasingly important—
to academic clinician-scientists. The objective of my Career Development Activities, therefore, involves learning how to
navigate regulatory processes, FDA approvals, valuations, venture capital, contracts and intellectual property rights. Because
of the growing importance of commercialization of research findings to the health and sustainability of academic careers, my
overall mentoring objective of this K24 is to develop researchers who not only have the skills to conduct rigorous NextGen
mHealth studies, but also to extend the mass of NIH-funded mHealth research into the healthcare economy. My mentoring
approach incorporates several components that contributed to the success of my initial K24: dedicated funding for mentee’s
early investigations; outstanding institutional support; several sources of referral of high-quality mentees; and renowned co-
mentors who will help me establish a pipeline of mentees that have risen to that “cutting edge” where successful academic
careers begin. This proposed K24 renewal, with its focus on NextGen technologies, invisible biosensing, and machine
learning, is highly relevant to NIH’s mission because the lessons learned from this substance abuse and HIV research are
directly applicable to the care of patients with common, intractable, and expensive conditions."

Mammography screening for breast cancer has clear, substantial benefits, including significantly reduced breast
cancer mortality and improved treatment options for early detected cancers. However, regular mammography
screenings subject women to several potential harms, including high false positive rates, with over 60% of women
experiencing a false positive finding after 10 years of annual screening; high false negative rates, with more can-
cers missed in dense breasts which obscure tumor appearance; and high recall rates, causing undue anxiety
and unnecessary, potentially invasive workup for women with a false positive screen. New 3D mammography
technology called digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) has shown increased cancer detection and decreased re-
call rates, but radiologists require longer interpretation time and may lack experience. The clinical workflow could
potentially be enhanced with computer aided detection systems. However, current methods only focus on a single
mammogram exam, ignoring crucial decision-making information that a radiologist would consider, such as prior
mammograms, patient demographics, and personal history. Conversely, established breast cancer risk models
rely only on patient demographics and personal/family history, excluding mammographic history. Toward the
overarching goal of reducing the harms and increasing the benefits of mammography screening, we propose to
increase accuracy of breast cancer detection and predict future cancer development from serial 3D mammogram
screenings using a novel deep learning model that jointly incorporates spatial, temporal, and non-imaging clinical
information. Our method adopts attention-based neural networks, i.e., Transformers, which learn complex depen-
dencies between different elements in a sequence and automatically attend to the most relevant information. In
addition to the potential for improved performance, the attention mechanism provides built-in model interpretation
to better understand the inputs that are important for the model’s predictions, instilling user confidence in the
model and facilitating extraction of mammographic biomarkers for breast cancer detection and development. Our
specific aims are to: 1) develop a powerful deep learning model for simultaneously leveraging spatial, temporal,
and non-imaging clinical information from DBT exams; 2) create a new tool to detect breast cancer from lon-
gitudinal DBT screenings; and 3) develop a new model for predicting development of breast cancer based on
longitudinal DBT studies and extract 3D mammographic biomarkers associated with cancer development. Be-
yond the direct benefit of improved breast cancer detection and risk estimation, this work could reduce radiologist
reading time and workload, inform new individualized screening protocols, further our understanding of the role
of breast architecture in cancer risk, and guide development and monitoring of preventive treatments. Finally,
the developed deep learning methodology will have wide applicability to spatiotemporal analysis in other medical
conditions and imaging domains."

 Xenopus laevis is a remarkable model system used for decades to answer fundamental questions in cell,
developmental, and evolutionary biology. Several Nobel prizes were awarded for groundbreaking research in
Xenopus. Xenopus embryos have comparable organ development and morphology to mammalian systems, but
with the added benefit of being able to regenerate adult tissues, such as the optic nerve, lens, spinal cord, and
limb tissue. Over the years, Xenopus has been used to model several human diseases and syndromes, including
congenital heart disorders, heterotaxia, gastrointestinal and pancreatic diseases, endocrine disorders, kidney
disease, cancer, ciliopathies, orofacial defects, and neurodevelopmental disorders.
 Xenopus is a powerful in vivo model system, but robust complementary in vitro tools are still limited. While
animal caps and tissue explants can be easily isolated from Xenopus embryos, and cultured in vitro, these cells
do not survive for extended time periods. Furthermore, cellular and intracellular processes are often difficult to
document and analyze in vivo. These limitations prompted the establishment of several cell lines in the 1990's,
but they fell out of favor for the more amenable mammalian in vitro systems. Since then, the Xenopus community
has relied on the use of human or mouse cell lines, including embryonic and induced stem cells, which introduce
inherent variability due to species differences. Even though the blueprint of vertebrate development across
species is largely conserved, several aspects of cellular, tissue, and organ biology have species specific
characteristics. An example among many, during development Xenopus neural crest expresses both the
transcription factors Snai1 and Snai2, while mouse neural crest only expresses Snai1 and the chick neural crest
only Snai2. These differences constrain the use of cross species systems experimentally. As a result, we and
others are engaged in efforts to expand the in vitro toolbox of the Xenopus community. We propose to generate
new Xenopus stem cell lines to enhance current and future research projects for the Xenopus community.
 Stem cells represent a normal physiological state, their genomes lack abnormalities typically found in most
tissue culture lines, and they can be differentiated into many different cell types and organoids. Furthermore, a
strong advantage offered by Xenopus stem cells would be the opportunity to perform genome editing efficiently,
as well as somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) to generate F0 homozygous null animals to create new mutants.
 Currently, stem cell lines are obtained via two methods: embryonic stem cells isolated from the inner cell
mass of mammalian blastocyst-stage embryos, and induced pluripotent stem cells obtained via reprogramming
of mature cells to re-initiate endogenous pluripotency programs. In this application we propose to generate
embryonic stem cell lines from animal pole cells isolated at the blastula stage and reprogram newly generated
primary cell lines derived from tadpole tissues to produce induced pluripotent stem cells."
10843152,"Social stress is one of the most common forms of stress experienced by humans and has been well documented
to contribute to a wide variety of neuropsychiatric conditions. Exposure to repeated social defeat stress (SDS)
in rodents enhances the rewarding and reinforcing effects of several drugs of abuse, including alcohol, and is a
reliable predictor of future drug use. SDS is effectively modeled in animals through social defeat paradigms,
where an antagonistic encounter is initiated between two animals of the same species. There is substantial
overlap between brain regions that mediate the behavioral response to stressors and those that mediate drug
addiction, implying shared neural circuitry. However, the precise neural mechanisms by which social stressors
increase alcohol consumption are not well understood. This application will address this gap in knowledge by
using a cell type agnostic approach to identify and profile the transcriptomes of cells that are activated by both
SDS and alcohol exposure at single cell resolution. Using the recently developed TRAP2 (Targeted
Recombination in Activated Populations) system and a mouse model for SDS-induced escalation of alcohol
drinking, we examined the overlap between neural ensembles that are activated by social stress and alcohol
consumption in the same animal. Our preliminary results indicate that SDS increased alcohol consumption and
neuronal activation in the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) and the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus
(PVN), brain regions known to mediate the motivational effects of stress. We found that both stress and alcohol
by themselves activate a large number of cells in the PVT and PVN. Interestingly, our results also indicate that
>80% of stress-activated cells are also activated by alcohol in these brain regions. Based on these results, we
hypothesize that transcriptional programs in cells that are activated by both stress and alcohol in the PVT and
PVN are unique compared to those that are activated by stress alone or alcohol alone and underlie stress-
induced escalation of alcohol consumption. We propose to use single nuclei sequencing to transcriptionally
profile cells in the PVT and PVN that are activated by both stress and alcohol. We will then identify genes,
pathways and processes that are dysregulated in these cells. We also propose to us the Library of Integrated
Cellular Signatures (LINCs) to identify compounds that will reverse these transcriptional signatures and are thus
predicted to prevent stress-induced escalation of alcohol consumption."

The information flow between the peripheral organs and the brain is increasingly recognized as bidirectional,
with activity in peripheral circuits influencing high-level behaviors including mood, motivation, and stress. To
establish mechanistic links between activity of peripheral neurons and brain circuits, we will develop a species-
agnostic framework for targeting and remote modulation of specific cells within the peripheral organs and the
brain during behavior. Our framework will combine the homing, modulation, and contrast properties of synthetic
magnetic nanomaterials with the targeting specificity of viral vectors.
Magnetic nanomaterials have recently emerged as versatile transducers of remotely applied weak magnetic
fields into thermal, chemical, or mechanical stimuli perceived by ion channels. We will dramatically expand the
palette of magnetic nanotransducers to enable receptor-specific remote magnetic modulation of neurons (or
other electrogenic cells) anywhere in the body during free behavior. Moreover, we will leverage recent advances
in adeno-associated viral vectors for targeting specific cells and tissues by creating an array of fusions of
nanotransducers and viral capsids. This will allow for magnetic guidance and localization of the hybrid magnetic-
viral fusions to the locations of interest following systemic delivery regardless of the model organism.
We will apply our framework to elucidate circuits connecting the enteric (gut) nervous system to the midbrain
structures. Recent work has drawn links between gastrointestinal dysfunction and social and mood disorders as
well as demonstrated vagal transmission of the enteric signals to the brain. By applying receptor-specific
modulation to the enteric neurons we intend to test the hypothesis that their activity influences midbrain pathways
governing reward and motivation, and possibly motor behaviors.
In addition to empowering studies of gut-brain circuits, our species-agnostic framework can be extended to
investigate connections between any peripheral organ and the brain thus opening opportunities to develop
peripheral organ interventions for neurological and mental conditions."

Circadian rhythm disruption is experienced by patients with Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders and
millions of shiftworkers worldwide, which may increase their risk of developing chronic health disorders including
cardiovascular disease. Treatment of circadian rhythm disruption requires appropriately-timed intervention to
either shift the circadian system earlier (advance) or later (delay). A Phase Response Curve (PRC) informs when
to administer the intervention, without which the disruption may either be prolonged due to inadequate phase
resetting or worsened due to shifting the system in the wrong direction. Currently, the field relies on the PRC for
resetting the melatonin rhythm as guide to reset the entire circadian system, despite the fact that circadian
rhythms are present in many other physiological features besides melatonin. Our preliminary data show that
there are robust circadian rhythms in circulating levels of total cholesterol and triglyceride in healthy young
individuals and that these rhythms can also be shifted. Our pilot studies further indicate that the timing of these
lipid rhythms may be more responsive to shifts in the timing of meals rather than light exposure. We have
constructed preliminary PRCs of these lipid rhythms in response to a combined stimulus of light exposure and
meals distributed across the 24-h day and detected robust phase advances and delays. Moreover, the shifts in
these lipid rhythms are larger than those for melatonin. We do not know, however, whether light exposure or
meal timing is the primary time cue for resetting these lipid rhythms. Without this knowledge, developing a
comprehensive treatment for circadian rhythm disruption of lipid rhythms that likely underlies the cardiometabolic
consequences of shiftwork, will remain difficult. The objective of this proposal is to construct three PRCs that
systematically examine the contribution of light and meal timing on resetting lipid circadian rhythms. Young
healthy adults will be randomized to three conditions: (1) bright light + 12-h meal window, (2) dim light + 12-h
meal window, and (3) dim light + 6.5-h meal window (time redistricted eating), each distributed across the 24-h
day. The primary outcomes include phase resetting of lipid and melatonin circadian rhythms measured under
each of the three conditions, and the area-under-the curve of the lipids during the 6.5-h time restricted eating.
The aims of the study are to: (1) determine if light is the primary time cue for resetting melatonin but not lipid
circadian rhythms, (2) determine if meal timing is the primary time cue for resetting lipid but not melatonin
circadian rhythms, and (3) evaluate the acute effects of eating across the 24-h day on circulating lipid levels. Our
work will be a comprehensive evaluation of how two daily events – light exposure and meals – synchronize lipid
circadian rhythms in humans. We expect our analytic paradigm to be a foundational resource that can be
extended to future studies of other peripheral systems under circadian regulation in humans, and have a positive
public health impact by guiding therapeutic strategies for patients with circadian disruption and the population at
large, many of whom experience recurrent circadian disruption due to irregular sleep-wake schedules."

Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is among the world’s most common and devastating blood disorders, affecting more
than 300,000 newborns per year. The majority of infants with SCA are born in the low-resource settings of sub-
Saharan Africa, where an estimated 50-90% will die before 5 years of age due to lack of early diagnosis and
appropriate care. Hydroxyurea is a once-daily oral medication that has become the standard of care for the
treatment of children with SCA in high-resource settings. There is now a growing body of evidence to support
the safety and clinical benefits of hydroxyurea for the treatment of SCA in sub-Saharan Africa. The requirement
for frequent laboratory monitoring and the concern for hematologic laboratory toxicities, however, will limit
widespread hydroxyurea utilization. We have recently developed and prospectively evaluated an individualized,
pharmacokinetics-guided hydroxyurea dosing strategy for children with SCA that has demonstrated optimal
clinical and laboratory benefits with minimal toxicity. In this proposal, we aim to extend this precision medicine
approach to Africa. This proposal includes a prospective, randomized clinical trial of hydroxyurea for children
with SCA at two clinical sites in sub-Saharan African (Luanda, Angola and Mwanza, Tanzania). The study will
be the first to bring precision medicine to children with SCA through several novel features including
measurement of hydroxyurea using a battery-powered HPLC machine and individualized dose calculations using
an automated computer-based algorithm. The first phase of the study will compare dosing strategies and
determine the optimal dosing strategy, and the second phase will importantly address the safety of hydroxyurea
therapy with limited laboratory monitoring. The primary objectives are to establish the feasibility and evaluate the
clinical benefits of PK-guided hydroxyurea for children with SCA in Africa and to provide evidence to support
minimal laboratory monitoring with hydroxyurea therapy in these settings. We will accomplish these objectives
through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: To compare the clinical benefits of two hydroxyurea dosing
strategies for treatment of SCA in sub-Saharan Africa: a novel individualized, PK-guided initial dose without
subsequent escalation and a weight-based dose with subsequent dose escalation. We hypothesize that the PK-
guided arm will have a reduction in sickle-related adverse events compared to the weight-based arm. Specific
Aim 2: To evaluate the safety of hydroxyurea for children with SCA in sub-Saharan Africa with limited laboratory
monitoring. We hypothesize that there will be no difference in the frequency of adverse events (Grade ≥ 3)
unrelated to SCA during the period of hydroxyurea treatment with limited monitoring compared to the no
treatment run-in period. Exploratory Aim 3: To evaluate the utility and validity of two established measures of
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) for patients and families affected by SCA in Angola and Tanzania before
and after hydroxyurea treatment. We hypothesize that baseline HRQoL measures will be low for both measures
and will improve significantly with hydroxyurea treatment."
10916227,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Protein post-translational modification (PTM) and alternative splicing enable the limited genome of a
cell to dynamically respond to environmental changes by diversifying its protein repertoire. Previous studies
have revealed that environmental cues impact alternative splicing through numerous PTMs of RNA-binding
proteins associated with the spliceosome. S-nitrosylation, the reversible covalent PTM of a protein cysteine
residue by the gaseous signaling molecule nitric oxide (NO) to form an S-nitrosothiol (SNO)-modified protein,
has been shown to alter protein function to play profound roles on cellular physiology, including the regulation
of gene expression. Specifically, S-nitrosylation is known to directly regulate key transcription factors as well
as to modify enzymes that alter the epigenome. Intriguingly, RNA-binding proteins of the heterogenous
nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family, including the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB), are
common in proteomic identifications of SNO-modified proteins under multiple conditions and in many cell
types. Because PTB is a master regulator of alternative splicing, we are exploring the central hypothesis that
NO enables a cell to dynamically regulate RNA splicing through SNO modification of PTB.
 Our laboratory recently mapped S-nitrosylation to a single cysteine residue in PTB. Dramatic
alternations in gene expression when cells are exposed to NO are absent when this cysteine is mutated, strongly
supporting a role for SNO in regulating the activity of PTB with transcriptome-wide implications. This
proposal will interrogate these findings through three independent aims: Aim 1 will develop a bioinformatic
pipeline based on RNA sequencing analyses to identify specific alternative transcripts regulated by SNO-PTB,
including those that may have an outsized effect on global gene expression; Aim 2 will elucidate how SNO
affects PTB conformation and its association with protein and RNA components of the spliceosome, offering a
molecular mechanism for the influence of NO on alternative splicing; and Aim 3 entails the use of a conditional
knock-in mutant mouse in which PTB cannot undergo the SNO modification, allowing determination of the
physiological role of SNO-PTB by observing the consequences of dysregulated NO signaling.
 This project will advance our understanding of the role of NO signaling as a crucial mechanism of the
cellular response to environmental cues through SNO-modification of a central regulator of alternative
splicing, PTB. Heretofore, global effects of NO on cellular function have been attributed to widespread
modification of proteins. The role of NO in regulating alternative splicing is previously unappreciated, and
provides new perspectives on dynamic regulation of cellular function in health and disease. This study will
thus define the role of NO in alternative splicing for the first time, potentially opening new areas of research."
10884406,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) represents a therapy recalcitrant disease with 5-year survival rate of
approximately 10%. Multiple failed clinical trials reinforce the need for new approaches to treatment that employ
rationally developed therapies targeting key genetic features of PDAC tumors as well as the tumor
microenvironment. Fundamentally PDAC is a KRAS-driven tumor; however, approaches to target KRAS either
genetically or pharmaceutically have led to the realization that tumors can evolve mechanisms to continue cell
division in the presence of such interventions. Using a combination of unbiased analyses and patient derived
models we find that most tumors have evolved mechanisms to deregulate the retinoblastoma tumors suppressor
(RB) pathway that limits the effectiveness of targeting RAS or effector pathways (e.g. MEK inhibition).
Consequently, the activation of RB is sufficient to limit the proliferation and tumorigenic growth of PDAC models.
In addition to effects on the proliferation, we have found that RB activation is sufficient to coordinate changes in
gene expression that impact on genes related to classical vs. basal subtypes of PDAC and immunological gene
expression programs (e.g. antigen presentation and interferon response). Unlike cell cycle responses, these
changes in gene expression are more heterogeneous and the underlying mechanisms and key regulatory
elements remain poorly understood. In Aim 1 we will delineate the RB regulation and mechanisms of gene
expression regulation in PDAC models. While RB status clearly has effects on tumor cell division, an important
element of RB-pathway activation are effects related to the tumor microenvironment. Preliminary and published
data indicate that RB activation has broad effects on the tumor stroma and immunological milieu. Much of these
studies have employed systemic strategies that impact on both the tumor and the host. In preliminary data, we
have found that activation of RB selectively within the tumor is sufficient to change the fibroblastic and
immunological cell subtypes with the tumor, albeit not at the same level of systemic treatments. Here we will
interrogate the intersection between the tumor and the microenvironment and how these impact tumor-static
response and can be exploited by immunotherapy approaches. Together, Aim 2 will define the impact of RB-
activation on the tumor microenvironment using a combination of immune competent models and clinical
specimens."
10891416,"Project Summary
The Metro-Minnesota Community Oncology Research Consortium (MMCORC), formerly known as the Metro-
Minnesota Community Clinical Oncology Program (MMCCOP), has a long history of success, as demonstrated
by the ongoing commitment of is original members and the consortium's growth from 1979 to 2018. Today,
MMCORC is an established community program that began through its National Cancer Institute (NCI)-funded
Community Hospital Cancer Program Award. This program improved cancer care delivery in the community
and was the cornerstone for the Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) initiative. It received the initial
NCI CCOP grant in 1983 and has been awarded subsequent CCOP grants in 3- to 5-year increments until the
5-year NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) grant in 2014. In 2010, hospitals, clinics, and
oncologists in the MN Community Group Outreach Program joined MMCCOP, resulting in a metro-wide
community cancer research program in Minneapolis-St. Paul. In 2014, MMCCOP received funding under the
new NCORP grant program. In 2016, MMCCOP was renamed MMCORC to represent the disbanding of the
NCI CCOP grant program and show the broad scope of oncology research services available to the
community, consistent with a consortium model. MMCORC represents 25 hospital and clinics with a common
approach and established mechanisms for identifying, enrolling, and following participants on NCI- sponsored
treatment, cancer prevention and control, symptom management, and care delivery research protocols. The
state health market remains extremely competitive and is constantly changing due to mergers and healthcare
reform initiatives. Despite this environment, MMCORC hospitals and staff continue to collaborate and support
the added time and expense of offering clinical research trials to patients in the communities we serve.
The consortium incorporates a substantial segment of the oncology community and has provided a basis for
communication, partnership, and collaboration among practicing oncologists, their hospital administrators, and
other health professionals for 35 years. Combined, the consortium members see, on average, more than
17,170 new analytic cancer patients per year. In the consortium, 165 MD investigators represent medical
oncology, hematology, and radiation and surgical oncology, including thoracic surgery, gynecologic oncology,
radiology, neuro-oncology, obstetrics and gynecology, palliative care, and primary care, with 57 mid-level
clinicians (nurse practitioners and physician assistants) considered associate investigators.
MMCORC intends to continue to offer the community the most recent advances in cancer prevention,
treatment, symptom management, and care delivery through continued affiliations with NCORP research
bases such as Alliance, ECOG-ACRIN, NRG Oncology, SWOG via CTSU, URCC, and CCCWFU. By
implementing proactive strategies to improve access and encourage participation from underrepresented and
underserved groups, MMCORC is well positioned to achieve the goals of the NCORP set forth by the NCI."

The mission of the proposed program is to develop a lasting, robust institutional training program for highly
talented underrepresented minority (URM) students to pursue careers in biomedical research. Our program
builds on the existing partnership between Malcolm X College (MXC), a community college in Chicago IL, and
University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), the largest, public, Research I University in the region. The program is
built upon the idea that a training program, if it is to be successful in serving associated students, must also
change the students’ undergraduate experience, the faculty, and the institutions involved. Hence, we have
three specific aims: (1) recruiting and supporting trainees, (2) engaging in faculty development to enhance
inclusion, and (3) institutional transformation at multiple levels. Weaving through these three aims is a
consistent focus on how the students and their communities are impacted by health disparities, with particular
attention paid to cancer research, but also incorporating methodology and themes applicable to a variety of
STEM-related fields. Activities associated with Aim 1 include completion of introductory science courses at
MXC, engagement with admission transfer advisors before and after transfer to UIC, participation in UIC
workshops on research methods, ethics, and culture of science, participation in summer research experiences
with UIC mentors, and presentation of results at local and national conferences. Activities associated with Aim
2 include focus on cancer research in introductory courses and structured research experiences for students,
and participation in annual mentoring workshops and expanding initiatives that address cancer disparities in a
laboratory setting. Finally, activities associated with Aim 3 include development of research career advising at
MXC, advising about the B2B training program and biomedical research opportunities, and monitoring
progress of our program. We hypothesize that a program focused on questions of health disparities and the
voices of the trainees and their communities, can support trainees in their development as biomedical
researchers, change how instructors and mentors approach the teaching and training in science, and develop
robust activities at the institutional level that can make research, health care, and education more inclusive."

The COVID 19 pandemic has been associated with the development of proteinuria in up to 40%
of hospitalized patients. This cardinal manifestation of kidney disease is most likely related to
effects of the extensive cytokine storm in these patients on glomeruli, the filtering units of the
kidney. Using five years of experience with studying cytokine storms related to Common Cold
induced relapse of some forms of human kidney disease, we developed four novel “cytokine
cocktail” models of the COVID 19 cytokine storm. These cytokine cocktails contain components
of the Innate and Adaptive immune response in a specific additive sequence and induce acute
albuminuria in mice. Also included in the cocktails is soluble Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2
(sACE2), a circulating form of the receptor for COVID 19 in humans. The presence of heightened
kidney disease in mice that are hypomorphs for the podocyte expressed transcriptional factor
Zhx2 may provide a partial genetic basis for greater severity of disease in select populations.
Using cytokine depletion and cytokine receptor blockage, we noted that it is possible to developed
treatment strategies to treat COVID related kidney disease.
In Specific Aim 1, we will conduct mechanistic studies in the podocyte related to the effect of
cytokine cocktail on the Interleukin 4 receptor, Interleukin 13 receptor, Tumor Necrosis Factor α
receptor, and transmembrane ACE2. In vivo studies using knockout mice and in vitro studies
using cultured podocytes will be conducted.
In Specific Aim 2, we will investigate mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of COVID 19
related glomerular disease, especially collapsing glomerulopathy. Mice deficient in glomerular
endothelial Integrin β5 expression, podocyte Zhx2 expression, or both will be used. Combination
of Integrin β5 expression deficient mice with those also deficient in podocyte cytokine receptors
and Tumor Necrosis Factor α receptor will be used to study paracrine and autocrine feedback
loops.
In Specific Aim 3, we will conduct systematic current cytokine depletion and receptor blockage
strategies, and also use them in combination to develop a novel therapeutic paradigm for the
treatment of COVID 19 related glomerular disease. It is likely that these depletion strategies will
benefit other end organ damage caused by the COVID 19 cytokine storm."
10897014,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The long-term objective of this project is to fully define the functions of dystrophin in striated muscle to
understand how its absence or abnormality leads to the pathologies observed in Duchenne and Becker
muscular dystrophies, and to inform on the potential for miniaturized dystrophins or utrophin to substitute for
dystrophin in a therapeutic context. In the current project period, we generated a new line of transgenic mdx
mice that expresses dystrophin lacking in vitro microtubule binding activity, but which surprisingly presented
with a fully rescued cortical microtubule lattice. We also analyzed microtubule organization in existing lines of
transgenic mdx mice expressing different truncated dystrophin constructs and found that two different micro-
dystrophins were less effective than two mini-dystrophins in restoring microtubule organization in mdx
muscles. Exciting new preliminary data identified a second region required for microtubule organization and
showed that the microtubule lattice of transgenic mdx mice expressing mini- or micro-dystrophins is rapidly
disrupted by eccentric contraction through a mechanism involving reactive oxygen species. Thus, the first
goal of aim 1 is to generate and characterize two new lines of transgenic mdx mice that will more definitively
confirm the regions of dystrophin necessary for stable microtubule lattice organization. Aim 1 will then
elucidate the relationship between eccentric contraction and reactive oxygen species in disrupting the
microtubule lattice in mdx muscles expressing mini- or micro-dystrophins. Finally, aim 1 will delineate the
interplay between the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex and cytoplasmic actins in effecting stable cortical
microtubule organization in mature skeletal muscle. We have also recently published atomic force microscopy
data suggesting that utrophin may be much stiffer than dystrophin and functionally less equivalent than
previously thought. We have acquired exciting preliminary data showing that the cellular system used to
express a model utrophin fragment significantly impacts its mechanical properties. In aim 2, we will extend our
preliminary studies in bacteria and insect cells to measure the mechanical properties of dystrophin and
utrophin constructs expressed in mammalian myoblasts. We will then carry out the first mechanical
characterization of single, full-length dystrophin molecules for comparison with our published utrophin data.
And finally, in aim 2 we will investigate how internal truncations affect the mechanical behavior of the most
therapeutically-relevant miniaturized dystrophins. Our proposed studies will provide new understanding into
the functions of dystrophin and utrophin in healthy muscle and will inform on the potential for miniaturized
dystrophins and utrophin to functionally replace dystrophin as therapeutic approaches for Duchenne muscular
dystrophy."
10870201,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Ascending aortic aneurysmal disease is a major worldwide health problem. Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV)-
associated aortopathy represents the largest subset of affected patients and this congenital anomaly is present
in 1-2% of the general population. Current aortic diameter-based guidelines for surgical intervention stem from
a non-controlled extrapolation of natural history data that does not reflect patient-specific aortic catastrophe
risk rendering under-treatment in some patients and over-treatment in others. This is largely because there is
an incomplete understanding of what biological and biomechanical features are unique to BAV-associated
aortopathy or other degenerative aneurysms and how these insults potentiate aortic dissection. During the
prior funding period, we uncovered several cellular, tissue architectural, and biomechanical-based features
distinguishing BAV-associated aortopathy from that of degenerative aneurysms. We discovered that elevated
production of superoxide anion by medial smooth muscle cells, increased oxidative stress-induced cellular
damages, and a biomechanical strength profile coupled with an anisotrophic collagen and elastin
microarchitecture uniquely define the tissue microenvironment of the BAV aorta. In the next phase of the
project, we will elucidate how an interplay of mechanical and oxidative stress mediates ECM remodeling,
determine where hypoxia comes into play, and how clinical imaging-derived metrics correspond to cellular and
tissue aberrations in the BAV aorta. In a two-aim approach, we will test the central hypothesis that mechanical
forces- and local hypoxia-induced oxidative stress invokes differential ECM remodeling in BAV and TAV
patients, and these insults can be correlated to patient-specific aortic wall indices that can be imaged, bundled
and used to predict disease progression and/or aortic catastrophe. Aim 1's approach will employ our
established patient-specific 3D culture models to determine how mechanical stretch and low oxygen tension
impact antioxidant response, free radical production, cellular oxidative damages, and influence ECM
production, microarchitecture and degradation in BAV aorta-derived smooth muscle cells. In Aim 2,
quantification of local hypoxic effects, measures of oxidative cellular damages, ECM microarchitecture, and
biochemical ECM composition will be regionally compared and then correlated with patient-specific wall shear
stress measurements from 4D flow MRI, aortic wall morphometrics from dynamic ECG-gated CTA, and
distensibility metrics from echocardiography to develop a workable patient-specific multi-parameter imaging-
based paradigm. Completion of this project phase will generate an aortic bio-map that profiles mechanical and
oxidative stress-mediated ECM remodeling in BAV-associated aortopathy and will identify what in vivo bio-
imaging endpoints correlate with these tissue insults. A perceived deliverable is a set of building blocks for a
workable multi-parameter computational model whose main output will be a patient specific aortic integrity
score that more accurately identifies dissection risk for a given patient. This work will also reveal new
opportunities for the implementation of PET-based probes to non-invasively detect local aortic vulnerability and
identify novel targets for medical therapeutic intervention."
10672865,"Success in school is a top priority for many post 9-11 Veterans, representing a critical step on the path
toward full community reintegration and independence following service. However, student Veterans with
traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post-traumatic stress (PTS) frequently experience issues with cognitive-
emotional dysregulation that interfere with school and other important life goals. Yet, scant empirical research
has evaluated cognitive rehabilitation approaches for student Veterans. Additionally, issues such as access,
stigma, and competing life demands often limit student Veterans’ use of traditional VA services to address their
cognitive and emotional concerns. Thus, we are challenged to consider novel approaches for improving college
success and life functioning among student Veterans with TBI and related conditions.
 As part of a larger clinical trial, this supplemental project will assess the feasibility, acceptability, and
utility of two novel neurocognitive trainings delivered via tele-video specifically for student Veterans with
history of TBI. Each intervention emphasizes a unique approach for improving TBI-associated difficulties with
goal-directed functioning, with clear and distinct intervention targets. One trains Veterans skills for effectively
regulating their cognitive-emotional state when pursuing their goals, especially when faced with challenges.
This training makes use of digital scenarios and remote coaching to support skill learning and generalization.
The second provides Veterans with psychoeducation regarding TBI and lifestyle factors to optimize brain
health. Both interventions utilize advances in tele-rehabilitation (e.g., online resources, digital apps, and
combinations of asynchronous content and interactive coaching over tele-video) to provide varied and
engaging learning experiences for Veterans in different locations and settings; both interventions are also
matched for intervention time, attention, and expectation of benefit. In a process that involves student
Veterans and college faculty as constituents, this supplemental project will also solicit feedback regarding
additional needs and preferences of student Veterans. Together, results from this supplemental study will
support ongoing iterative development of these interventions and form the basis for a clinical trial focused
specifically on student Veterans.
 Post-9/11 Veterans with a history of TBI who are currently enrolled in post-secondary education (ages
21-60) will be recruited for this study. Through a combination of surveys, behavioral logs, and semi-structured
interviews, participants will be queried regarding 1) the feasibility and acceptability of intervention
implementation via tele-video; 2) critical aspects of the intervention process involved with learning and making
use of training targets in academic and other life goals (e.g., perceived relevance and benefits of training topics
for school; intentions to apply training topics to academic goals), and 3) perceived needs, preferences, and
goals relevant to student Veterans. Interviews with college faculty will also provide feedback on adaptations of
the current interventions to address the needs and preferences of student Veterans. We will perform
descriptive statistics and qualitative content analyses on the data. The resulting data from this supplemental
project will help inform the next iteration of intervention development which focuses on making Veteran-
centered modifications to existing neurocognitive trainings in order to better reach student Veterans ‘where
they are’ – that is, in a manner that explicitly addresses barriers to engagement, incorporates student Veterans’
needs and preferences, and is best aligned with student Veterans’ goals.
 This project will provide valuable information needed for continued innovations in treatment
formulations and modes of delivery to meet the unique needs of student Veterans and promote their
engagement with rehabilitation. The long-term goal of this project is to maximize engagement and access to
neurocognitive skills training approaches to increase success for Veterans in school and beyond."

Genetically modified and immunocompromised animals are the gold-standard models for investigating the
molecular regulation of hematopoietic cells in the context of normal development and diseases, and for the
development of novel stem cell-based therapeutic modalities for a wide variety of non-malignant hematological
disorders. The future of hematology research also lies in our ability to examine hematopoietic cell function at
single cell level and correlate single cell behavior with transcriptome and epigenetic profiling. The CCCEH
Xenotransplant and Genome Editing Core (XGEC) is an established, productive and innovative core
designed to provide specialized mouse strains, a wide variety of animal services for efficiency and
standardization of cell transplantation assays, and transgenic animal services in a timely and cost effective
fashion to members of the CCHSCC. The overarching hypothesis is that a centralized core service providing
the myriad mouse needs of CCHSCC members will enhance the effectiveness, timeliness, cost-efficiency and
overall impact of the scientific research and thereby accelerate the discovery and treatment of hematological
diseases.
 XGEC provides specialized mouse strains in a cost effective manner compared with external vendors,
including a collection of immunodeficient mouse strains (i.e., NSG, NSG-3GM3, NRG-SGM3, Rag-/-gc-/-
/WvWv, and B6.BoyJ) utilized for xenotransplantation of human hematopoietic cells, for preclinical studies
concerning gene transfer in humans and mouse hematopoietic stem cells, for human hematopoietic stem cell
and single cell engraftment studies, and for quantitative (competitive) hematopoietic stem cell engraftment
studies (Aim 1). The XGEC further provides specialized animal services allowing for population and single cell
transplantation assays, including animal irradiation and cell transplantation services (Aim 2), and animal
manipulation and monitoring services (Aim 3). In addition, the XGEC offers all services for the generation of
transgenic and genetically–modified mouse lines (Aim 4). Since it began offering CRISPR-Cas services in
March 2014, the core has already generated engineered animal models to CCHMC investigators and among
Centers and within the wider research community. Lastly, XGEC provides technical support and facilitates
research collaborations for comprehensive design and analysis of in vivo studies (Aim 5). These services will
facilitate the sharing of expertise and promote interaction between investigators participating in the CCCEH,
and will attract new core users in the future. Overall, the XGEC offers a unique combination of animal services
and concentrated expertise performed by well-trained personnel under the supervision of Drs. Starczynowski
and Huang in a cost effective and standardized way, thereby providing state-of-the-art investigation of non-
malignant molecular hematology. These services will support the development of new therapeutic modalities
(pharmacological and cell-based) and translational Phase I and II studies."
10899715,"SCCPC Abstract
As a direct result of our ability to analyze hematopoietic cells at the single cell level, our understanding
of the complexity and heterogeneity of the hematopoietic system has dramatically evolved in the past 10
years. The use of high-end flow cytometry and transcriptomics allowed investigators to measure cell-to-
cell differences and correlate genomic information with single-cell function. Our understanding of non-
malignant hematology is rapidly evolving, and now requires integration of transcriptome, epigenome,
proteome (and now “organellome”) both at the single-cell level and in bone marrow in situ. However,
rigorous experimental dissection of hematopoietic stem and progenitors (HSCP) requires specialized
expertise and fascile technical agility that serves as a barrier to many researchers in the field. To answer
this critical need, the Single Cell Characterization and Procurement Core (SCCPC) is designed to provide
both expertise on data analytics platforms as well as technical advise (and access to) specialized services
to facilitate cutting-edge multi-dimensional single-cell analyses for functional and mechanistic
understanding of non-malignant hematology. Although such technologies are widely available, access to
these services at most institutions is not accompanied by requisite understanding of hematopoiesis and
stem cell biology (and/or analysis pipelines). Thus, there is a need for easy access to training and
expertise on using analytic platforms, and how to integrate datasets. The SCCPC provides unique
services for investigating hematopoiesis at the single-cell level including: (1) standardized and centralized
services in flow cytometry analysis and isolation to reduce costs for investigators; (2) specialized services
in multispectral flow cytometry and multi-dimensional analyses; (3) specialized analysis pipelines for
integrating orthogonal “omics” layers; (4) specialized services in high resolution confocal
immunofluorescence imaging for fixed, live and in situ single cell imaging; (5) specialized services in
study design, large dataset analyses and interpretation; and (6) development of new cutting-edge
technologies for investigators to use in their research. The Central Goal of the SCCPC is to create a
centralized center providing advise/expertise on data analyses and integration to facilitate a
comprehensive cutting-edge multi-dimensional single-cell understanding – functionally and
mechanistically – of non-malignant hematology. The SCCPC has dedicated professionally trained staff
with great experience in scientific experimental design and client support. The aims of the core are to
provide innovative, state-of-the-art facilities and sophisticated technical assistance for high quality
analysis of single hematopoietic cells; to provide uniform quality of cell preparations; to reduce costs of
individual investigators by using shared flow cytometry, genomics analyses and imaging facilities; and to
train/educate in new concepts on cell analysis, isolation, bioinformatics analyses and imaging."
11092536,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The National Institute on Aging (NIA) Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementia (AD/ADRD)
Collaboratory will serve as a national resource to promote the development and conduct of embedded pragmatic
clinical trials (ePCTs) to improve care and outcomes for persons with dementia (PWD) and their caregivers, in
partnership with the various healthcare systems (HCS) that deliver their care. To achieve this objective, the
Collaboratory must be more than just a sum of its parts. An initiative of this scope requires not only that each
component has the requisite infrastructure and resources, but also that activities are synergistically integrated
across components. To do so will require an exceptional Administration and Management Core. The Core’s
Specific Aims are to: Aim 1. Administer, manage, and integrate all the components of the AD/ADRD
Collaboratory; Aim 2. Coordinate support and guidance for pilot project and NIA-funded investigators conducting
ePCTs in PWD from the Working Group Cores and Administration Teams; and Aim 3. Coordinate the
development and dissemination of all products, guidance materials, and training opportunities for key aspects of
conducting ePCTs in PWD and their caregivers. Several factors will enable the Core to meet its formidable task.
First, it will benefit from the experienced and cohesive leadership of the Multiple Principal Investigators (MPIs),
Drs. Vincent Mor (Brown University School of Public Health) and Susan Mitchell (Hebrew Senior Life Institute for
Aging Research (HSL IFAR)). Second administrative responsibilities will be supported by the rich research
infrastructures of their institutions which have a long history of collaboration. Two highly-accomplished Executive
Directors will lead the teams at each site; Rosa Baier MPH (Brown) and Ellen McCarthy PhD (HSL IFAR). Third,
administrative functions will be organized across eight Teams (four per site) as follows: 1. Grants Administration
(Brown); 2. Organization and Logistics (Brown); 3. Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Regulatory (Brown), 4. Data
Sharing and Standards (Brown), 5. Investigator Navigation (HSL IFAR), 6. Communication and Knowledge
Dissemination (HSL IFAR), 7. Stakeholder Engagement (HSL IFAR), and 8. Diversity and Inclusion (HSL IFAR).
Finally, specialized service providers will be engaged to manage large, critical tasks that can be done more
efficiently with their expertise (e.g. website creation and maintenance, single Institutional Review Board (sIRB)).
Particularly innovative functions of the Core include: organizing proactive project support, coordinating the
mandatory sIRB, hosting a common REDCap database, and a dedicated Team to ensure issues related to
diversity and inclusion are met in all aspects of ePCT design. IMPACT: The proposed AD/ADRD Collaboratory
has all the necessary ingredients for success: strong leadership, ample resources, experts leading the Working
Group Cores and Teams, and a highly-impactful agenda. However, all these elements must be supported and
integrated for the Collaboratory to transform the delivery, quality, and outcomes of care for PWD and their
caregivers. The Administration and Management Core serves a critical role in achieving that objective."

Investigation of the molecular and cellular pathophysiology for hematologic diseases requires rapid and
low-cost access to vector preparations, and access to large libraries of vectors and production of vectors
destined to high throughput screening. Further, the successful development and testing of novel gene
therapies requires access to a translational vector “pipeline” which necessitates a close interaction
between basic research, research vector and clinical vector manufacturing laboratories. Cincinnati
Children’s Hospital Medical Center, a clinical and research institution of excellence, has developed
outstanding cores to provide hematology investigators with vector support for biological studies for the
genetic manipulation of cells and their translation to the clinic. This core has a track record of providing
high quality “research-grade” and “clinical-scale” vector services to investigators at various stages of basic
and translational research, ensuring expeditious translation to the clinic. The components of the Gene
Delivery Core (GDC) that contribute to this effort are the Viral Vector Core and Vector Library Core. Each
of these sub-cores are equipped with its own state-of-the-art research laboratories to allow rapid access
to vector libraries and viral vector products, their evaluation in routine basic research lab studies and/or
high throughput screens, and their translation to the clinic as the studies move through the translational
“pipeline”. All of this effort is backed by a strong Institutional commitment to translational research and
widely popular demands from users in the broad hematology field. Our objectives are to provide: (1)
research scale and medium scale pilot and feasibility viral vector products and consultation on vector type
and design, and (2) vector library core services including production of lentiviral shRNA and CRISPR
gRNA libraries for high throughput screening. Our overall goal is to advance research and development in
hematology via facilitating gene delivery, gene knock down, gene knockout or gene editing, to accelerate
the rate of translation."
11092539,"Project Summary – Technical Data Core
Health-system embedded pragmatic clinical trials (ePCT) that address the needs of people with dementia (PWD)
and their caregivers (CGs) are critical for developing and disseminating evidence-based, non-pharmacological
interventions. A key element of ePCTs is to use data derived from and integrated with the health system workflow
in the design, conduct, and dissemination of interventions. Central to the establishment of National Institute on
Aging (NIA) Alzheimer's disease (AD)/AD-related dementia (AD/ADRD) Healthcare Systems (HCS)
Collaboratory, the Technical Data Core (TDC) will develop methods, tools, and data strategies that enable
efficient use of electronic health records (EHRs), administrative data and other sources of information to
accelerate the conduct of ePCTs in PWD and their CGs in partnership with the HCSs that serve them. To do so,
the TDC core will conduct the foundational work needed to establish the methods that identify participants and
measure outcomes, provide technical assistance to implement those methods and monitor pilot progress, and
provide aggregated information about sites of care and geographic areas to assist in selection of pilot sites and
dissemination. The methods and tools developed in this Core will have broad applicability for future full-scale
ePCTs conducted with HCS that test interventions aimed at improving the care and outcomes for PWD and their
CGs. The TDC will be led Dr. Julie Bynum, Professor of Medicine in Geriatrics and Palliative Care at the
University of Michigan, an expert in the study of health system quality, processes and outcomes when caring for
older adults, with a specific focus on AD/ADRD. Dr. Bynum will be supported by five exceptional Executive
Committee members, who bring critical expertise in: natural language processing and informatics, complex data
sharing, experience with data needs of AD/ADRD ePCTs, healthcare information systems in complex illness,
and the NIH HCS Collaboratory’s Distributed Research Network. The Aims of the TDC are: Aim 1: To develop
and disseminate standardized and valid algorithms to identify and characterize PWD, from EHRs, registries and
administrative datasets (e.g., Medicare claims, Minimum Data Set) and their CGs; Aim 2: To develop and
disseminate standardized and valid data algorithms that capture relevant health outcomes of PWD and their
CGs; Aim 3: To provide technical assistance to Collaboratory pilot project leaders and career development
awardees, as well as NIA-funded investigators conducting ePCTs in PWD; and Aim 4: To enable access to
remote enclaves of sensitive data (e.g., EHRs, private claims records). IMPACT: A successful TDC is essential
to enable ePCTs by improving efficiency of participant identification and outcome measurement, and to provide
information that supports selection of sites for pilot studies and for ultimate dissemination of ePCT across HCS.
The methods and tools developed in this Core will have broad applicability for future full-scale ePCTs conducted
with HCS that test interventions aimed at improving the quality of care and outcomes for PWD and their CGs."
11092540,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) place a significant social and
economic burden on patients, families, and health care systems (HCS). Persons with dementia (PWD)
experience distressing symptoms such as agitation, pain, and difficulty eating, and their caregivers suffer
physical, emotional, and financial strain. At present, there is a limited evidence-base to support interventions
and services that could address these problems. Embedded pragmatic clinical trials (ePCTs) in HCS offer an
opportunity to remedy this. To be successful, however, this type of research must address the regulatory and
ethical challenges of research that involves this vulnerable population and also address perceived barriers to
conducting ePCTs in PWD in HCS that may be less familiar with research. Thus, the overarching objective of
the Regulation and Ethics Core within the National Institute of Aging (NIA) AD/ADRD HCS Collaboratory is to
clarify the appropriate balance among the competing priorities of promoting ePCTs in AD/ADRD, protecting the
interests of PWD and their caregivers, and providing HCS with assurance that regulatory issues are satisfactorily
addressed. The Regulation and Ethics Core will be led by Jason Karlawish M.D., a geriatrician and authority
on ethical and policy issues in research and care involving PWD, and will engage a multi-disciplinary team of
experts in AD/ADRD, geriatric medicine, ePCTs, health law, policy, and research regulation and ethics. The
Aims are: (1) to serve as a national resource for the research community (i.e., investigators, institutional review
boards, the NIA, the Office for Human Research Protections) by developing and disseminating guidelines and
best practices to address the particular ethical issues and regulatory structures encountered in conducting
ePCTs with PWD in their caregivers; (2) to identify and address the ethical and regulatory concerns and barriers
(e.g., lack of familiarity with research, stigma and changing nomenclature) to conducting ePCTs in PWD and
their caregivers from the perspectives of diverse HCS stakeholders; and (3) to provide guidance and training to
AD/ADRD Collaboratory-funded pilot project leaders, career development awardees, and NIA-funded
investigators, regarding ethical and regulatory issues. To achieve these aims, the Regulation and Ethics Core
will collaborate closely with the other AD/ADRD Collaboratory Working Group Cores and Teams. IMPACT: There
is an urgent need to improve the care provided by HCS for PWD and their caregivers; ePCTs are a novel
approach to transform the delivery, quality, and outcomes of care, but PWD are a vulnerable population that
present particular ethical and regulatory challenges for research. This Core will set the ethical and regulatory
foundation for the conduct of ePCTs in PWD and their caregivers. We are well positioned to achieve this given
our existing collaborative relationships, experience running center cores and multi-disciplinary expertise in ethical
and regulatory issues encountered in research and care that involves PWD and their caregivers."

A fundamental goal of the Cincinnati Cooperative Center of Excellence in Hematology (CCCEH) is to
facilitate scientific exchange and sharing of techniques, resources, and ideas in order to promote
creativity and productivity and foster collaborations through its Enrichment Program. The premises of
such a program are that (1) research progresses faster on the fertile ground of active discussion,

future is to train and nurture the next generation of researchers. The Divisions of Hematology and
Experimental Hematology at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital have a strong tradition in open exchange of
ideas and resources within the institution and with scientists from other institutions, establishing national
and international collaborations in the field of non-malignant hematology including signal transduction
in hematopoiesis and erythropoiesis, bone marrow failure syndromes, sickle cell disease, and
immunohematology. Within the previous NIDDK-P30 funded Cincinnati Center, the Principal
Investigators in these fields of science have developed a comprehensive training and mentoring
program that stimulates promising young investigators toward a research career focused on non-
malignant Hematology. Continuing on this mission, our aims within the Enrichment Core of the CCCEH
are: (1) to continue the active exchange of scientific progress and ideas between established
investigators within our center and with other centers in the ongoing weekly Hematology Grand Rounds,
and twice yearly Center Retreats to promote multidisciplinary collaborations between clinical, basic,
and translational hematology researchers; (2) to establish a Hematology Scholar training program with
the goal to foster an early-stage investigator as Scholar in non-malignant Hematology research; (3) to
sustain and enrich educational resources within our center for postdoctoral fellows and graduate
students; and (4) to support the summer training programs for undergraduate and high school students
to rotate in laboratories focusing in non-malignant hematology research, with the goal to promote
awareness and increase enthusiasm in young promising minds for research in the non-maligant

biostatistical expertise to Collaboratory-supported pilot studies, career development awardees (CDAs), and
other NIA-funded investigators conducting such trials. The DSC will contribute to all aspects of the design,
conduct, and analysis of these projects, and will develop novel statistical methodology for the design and
analysis of ePCTs conducted among PWD within HCS. To advance this field and create a durable knowledge
repository, the Design/Statistics Core will provide guidance in areas such as: 1) robust design of ePCTs, 2)
statistical analysis of ePCTs, 3) methods for handling missing data, contamination, and other irregularities, 4)
strategies for dealing with pitfalls of specific relevance to AD/ADRD, 5) replicability and reproducibility, 6)
multiplicity and multiple comparisons, 7) consideration of under-represented minorities and important
subgroups, including treatment of sex as a biological variable, 8) documentation and dissemination of software
and analytic code, 9) publication and dissemination, and 10) training and mentoring of junior quantitative
scientists and clinical investigators. The Design/Statistics Core’s other main function will be to provide
consultation and services to the AD/ADRD Collaboratory as a whole and particularly to the pilot studies,
career, CDA recipients, and other NIA-funded investigators. The work of the DSC will be enabled by the
leadership of Dr. Heather Allore PhD, Professor of Medicine in the Yale School of Medicine, and Professor of
Biostatistics at the Yale School of Public Health, and Director of the Yale Alzheimer's Disease Research
Center's Data Management and Statistics Core. She is an experienced trialist and founder of the field of
Gerontological Biostatistics. Dr. Allore will be joined by a team of six exceptional Executive Committee
members who bring varied expertise in AD/ARDR research, aging research, cluster randomized trials, and the
conduct of ePCTs in older persons. The DSC’s Aims are: Aim 1: To provide biostatistical assistance and
guidance to Collaboratory pilot studies, CDAs recipients and NIA-funded investigators planning or conducting
ePCTs in PWD and CG; Aim 2: To develop novel biostatistical approaches, and create and disseminate
guidance documents and products relevant to the design and conduct of ePCTs in PWD with HCS, Aim 3: To
work with the Technical/Data Core, to establish and manage access to and sharing of administrative data (e.g.,
electronic health records, claims data) for use by AD/ADRD Collaboratory investigators (e.g. pilot project
leaders), in providing guidance on reproducible analyses and replication studies."
11092543,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The lack of research testing interventions targeting patients with dementia (PWD) and their caregivers in real-
world settings hinders the ability of health care systems (HCS) to adequately care for this rapidly expanding
and highly vulnerable population. Pragmatic clinical trials that are embedded in HCS (ePCTs) can address this
shortcoming. However, ePCTs are complex, require specific methodologies, skilled investigators, close
partnerships with HCS, robust data infrastructures, and special regulatory and ethical considerations. Over the
past several years, individual teams of investigators have begun to acquire experience conducting ePCTs
among PWD and their caregivers. Their experience has reinforced how indispensable a pilot phase is to inform
the successful conduct of the full ePCT. The Pilot Core of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) AD/ADRD HCS
Research Collaboratory will therefore solicit, and fund over 30 pilot ePCTs and then guide all aspects of these
studies throughout their lifecycles. The Core will 1) create a robust and transparent review process, 2) provide
active technical assistance to increase the success of funded pilots, 3) promote the development of
investigator expertise and leverage experiences across projects through structured trainings, and 4) facilitate
the adaptation of pilot tested interventions into well-designed ePCTs. Ultimately, this will lead to full-scale
ePCTs, and simultaneously build investigator capacity to conduct ePCTs. The Pilot Core will be led by Dr.
Abraham Brody, PhD, RN, FAAN, Associate Professor of Nursing and Medicine at New York University, a
nurse researcher with significant experience in dementia and ePCTs, who will work with a highly skilled,
interdisciplinary, Executive Committee. The Pilot Core will leverage the overall infrastructure of the NIA
AD/ADRD HCS Collaboratory to achieve: Aim 1: Solicit, rigorously review, select, and fund projects that will
lead to future full-scale ePCTs focused on PWD and their caregivers; Aim 2: Provide the monitoring,
mentorship, and resources to ensure rigorous, timely completion of pilot milestones, and effective sharing of
pilot data and results; Aim 3: Promote the expertise of pilot project investigators in conducting ePCTs with
PWD and their caregivers by: 1. Integrating them into the activities of the AD/ADRD Collaboratory and Working
Group Cores, 2. Providing access to structured training opportunities led by the Training Core, and 3. Holding
an annual Scientific Conference in Years 3-5 to present and share research and experiences; Aim 4: Assist
pilot projects to transform completed pilot projects into successfully funded full-scale ePCTs in PWD and/or
their caregivers. IMPACT: The NIA AD/ADRD Collaboratory Pilot Core will assist researchers to investigate
practical interventions that can be implemented in HCS that serve over 5 million PWD and their caregivers.
These pilots will seed multiple full-scale ePCTs aimed at improving the quality of life and health outcomes of
this vulnerable population. It will also foster the expertise and career growth of pilot project leaders, enhancing
the nation’s capacity to conduct ePCTs among PWD with HCS well into the future."
11092545,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Over five million Americans currently live with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or an AD-related dementia (AD/ADRD).
Distressing symptoms and frequent transitions between care settings increase over the illness trajectory. Family
caregivers also experience adverse outcomes. Pragmatic clinical trials embedded (ePCTs) in healthcare
systems (HCS) are needed to accelerate the translation of evidence-based interventions for persons with
dementia (PWD) and their caregivers. To accomplish this larger goal, dementia-specific methods in patient and
caregiver reported outcome (PCRO) measurement are required to measure outcomes such as function,
symptom distress, quality of life, and caregiver experience. However, conceptual and methodologic gaps remain
in development of AD/ADRD PCROs, and methodologic barriers constrain data collection for use in ePCTs. The
overarching objective of this U54 application is to establish the National Institute on Aging (NIA) AD/ADRD HCS
Collaboratory. Within the AD/ADRD Collaboratory, the overarching objective of the Patient & Caregiver
Reported Outcomes (PCRO) Core is to develop and support use of PCROs relevant to PWD and caregivers,
working in collaboration with Administration and other AD/ADRD Collaboratory Cores and Teams. The PCRO
Core will be led by Dr. Laura Hanson, who combines experience in clinical trials for PWD and their caregivers
with extensive expertise in measuring quality and outcomes in serious illness. PCRO Core members have
expertise in clinical geriatrics and dementia care processes, dementia PCROs, measurement science, health
disparities for PWD and their caregivers, large datasets, and data capture for pragmatic trials and demonstration
projects. They will meet the following Specific Aims: Aim 1. To synthesize evidence and create a searchable
library of AD/ADRD Clinical Outcome Assessments (COAs), including patient-reported outcomes (PROs),
caregiver-reported outcomes (CROs), observer-reported outcomes (ObsROs), performance outcomes (PerfOs),
and clinician-reported outcomes (ClinROs) relevant to ePCTs and demonstration projects to improve care and
health outcomes for PWD and their caregivers; Aim 2. To define and disseminate best practices for efficient,
high-quality data collection systems for AD/ADRD COAs that can be captured in electronic health records
(EHRs), registries, and administrative databases for use in the Technical/Data Core; Aim 3. To provide expert
guidance and consultation on the measurement and research application of AD/ADRD COAs to AD/ADRD
Collaboratory pilot project leaders and junior career development awardees, as well as NIA-funded investigators
leading ePCTs focused on PWD and their caregivers. IMPACT: The NIA AD/ADRD HCS Collaboratory is
responsive to an urgent need for ePCTs to improve care and outcomes. The PCRO Core will fill current critical
gaps in measurement and data collection systems to capture the outcomes most significant to PWD, their
caregivers, and the clinicians who provide their healthcare."
11092547,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Over the past four decades, a host of non-pharmacologic interventions tested in trials (NIA Stage I, II, or III)
have demonstrated significant clinical benefits for people living with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or an AD-related
dementia (AD/ADRD;PWD) and family caregivers. Yet, with few exceptions, proven interventions have neither
been tested in health care settings (HCS) using embedded pragmatic trial (ePCTs) designs nor widely
disseminated. The lack of pragmatic testing in HCS impedes the adoption of such interventions into practice,
with families and health providers continuing to have limited knowledge of and access to evidence-based
care. To address this critical gap, the Dissemination and Implementation Core (D&I) of the NIA AD/ADRD
HCS Collaboratory (Collaboratory) will assist investigators, and stakeholders (HCS, PWD, caregivers,
providers, payers) when implementing and disseminating their dementia care interventions in the context of
ePCTs. This Core is based on a fundamental scientific assumption: D&I considerations are critical to address
throughout a project’s life-cycle (from idea conception, protocol development and testing to wide scale
implementation via the NIA Stage Model) to optimize an intervention’s potentiality for integration into HCS. A
major contribution of the D&I Core will be to advance and evaluate the utility of a novel framework to ascertain
level of “readiness” of an intervention to proceed to ePCTs. The D&I Core will be co-led by Drs. Laura N.
Gitlin and Joseph Gaugler and include an Executive Committee (EC) of five internationally recognized
experts in dementia implementation research. The D&I Core’s activities will be closely integrated with and
informed by the AD/ADRD Collaboratory’s Stakeholder Engagement and Diversity/Inclusion Teams, HCS
Leadership Council, and the Pilot, Training, Design/Statistics and Regulation/Ethics Cores. The Specific
Aims are: Aim 1. Conduct, regularly update, and disseminate syntheses of the scientific literature regarding
implementation of non-pharmacologic interventions for PWD and/or caregivers; Aim 2: Advance a framework
for identifying stage of development of pilot studies and their readiness for conducting ePCT; and Aim 3:
Provide ongoing technical assistance tailored to study needs of AD/ADRD Collaboratory-funded pilot project
leaders and Career Development Awardees, and other NIA-funded investigators doing ePCTs from the outset
of project development to enable them to advance their implementation and dissemination plans. IMPACT:
The persistent failure of widespread implementation of proven interventions in HCS for PWD and caregivers
is due in large part to inattention to D&I science from the inception of an intervention’s development.
Conducting ePCTs will require systematic attention to evidentiary practices for implementing studies in
complex, variegated HCS. The D&I Core is essential to assure implementation success of pilot studies, CDAs
and ePCTs in order to enhance clinical relevance and change dementia care."
11092550,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Most persons with dementia (PWD) receive care outside of institutions, meaning that the physical, emotional,
and financial burdens of dementia are borne not only by patients, but their caregivers as well. The fragmented,
complex US health care system exacerbates the challenge of delivering coordinated, whole-person care for
PWD. Designing and testing effective, practicable, non-pharmacological interventions must take into account
the heterogeneity of the health care landscape, the specific needs of this complex population, and the context
in which care is delivered. Although multiple interventions designed to improve care for PWD and their
caregivers have demonstrated efficacy, few have been adopted widely, and virtually none formally tested in
functioning health care systems (HCS). Reflecting the many unanswered questions in optimizing care for
PWD, our imperative is to close the gap between the development and testing of interventions and their later
adoption in real-world HCS. Thus, to develop a robust national capability to support embedded pragmatic
clinical trials (ePCT), we must leverage the combined expertise of researchers and front-line clinicians to
design interventions that ensure replicability, scalability, and sustainability. We will apply this expertise as we
address the unique intricacies of conducting ePCTs focused on meeting the needs of PWD and their
caregivers. The Health Care Systems (HCS) Core of the proposed National Institute on Aging (NIA)
Alzheimer's disease (AD)/AD-related dementia (AD/ADRD) HCS Collaboratory will engage experts from
integrated delivery systems, academic medical centers, nursing home systems, home care companies and
other community based providers to accomplish the following Specific Aims. Aim 1. Establish a collaborative,
supportive research resource involving diverse HCS in order to support and facilitate research in the settings
where PWD and their caregivers receive care; Aim 2. Develop, document, and disseminate setting-specific
approaches to conducting ePCTs in PWD; Aim 3. Facilitate the conduct of rigorous pilot studies, Career
Development Award (CDA) projects, and NIH-funded ePCTs in diverse care HCS targeting PWD and their
caregivers. IMPACT: A successful HCS Core will partner with the other AD/ADRD Collaboratory Cores and
Teams to facilitate rigorous, high-quality research studies focused on PWD and their caregivers, in which
multiple health care delivery organizations participate. Combining deep expertise in ePCTs and first-hand
knowledge of caring for the AD/ADRD population in a range of settings, the HCS Core will become an
unparalleled national research resource to help promulgate successful HCS based interventions designed to
meet the needs of PWD, caregivers, and health systems that serve them."
11092552,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The over-riding objective of the National Institute of Aging (NIA) Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer’s disease
and related dementias (AD/ADRD) Collaboratory is to serve as a national resource for the conduct of embedded
pragmatic clinical trials (ePCTs) that improve the care of persons with dementia (PWD) and their caregivers
(CGs), in partnership with the healthcare systems (HCS) that serve them. Inherent in this objective is the need
to train and support a cadre of talented investigators prepared to carry on this work well into the future. As such,
the Training Core of the NIA AD/ADRD Collaboratory seeks to support the training of junior investigators to
become experts in this field. It will do so by exploiting the expansive expertise across the entire NIH AD/ADRD
Collaboratory as well as the foundational work of the National Institutes of Health HCS Collaboratory. In
collaboration with the other seven Cores, the Training Core will facilitate peer-to-peer, inter-professional,
interdisciplinary, and inter-sector (academia-HCS-government) mentoring and support to raise the skill set of all
participants. The Training Core will be co-led by Christopher M. Callahan, MD and Alexia M. Torke, MD, both
of whom bring decades of experience in developing junior investigators as independent researchers. The
Training Core’s Specific Aims are: Aim 1. To develop, fund, and coordinate a two-year junior career
development award (CDA) program for MD and PhD early career trainees who seek to build their career
conducting ePCTs in PWD by leveraging the rich resources of the AD/ADRD Collaboratory. Three CDAs will be
funded in each of Years 3 and 4, for a total of six CDAs; Aim 2. To develop and implement structured training
activities that address all aspects of conducting ePCTs in PWD for junior investigators, including both internal
trainees (CDA recipients, junior pilot project awardees, post-doctoral students in Working Core Groups) and
trainees external to the AD/ADRD Collaboratory, including: 1. a Training Workshop and Retreat in Boston in
Years 3-5, and 2. a series of web-based video training modules. Aim 3. To integrate CDA recipients and other
junior investigators within the AD/ADRD Collaboratory into the academic activities of Working Group Cores and
Teams (e.g., writing manuscripts, guidance materials) to promote their professional expertise and individual
productivity. IMPACT: Building the nation’s capacity to conduct impactful ePCTs in AD/ADRD requires not only
supporting pilot projects and NIA-funded ePCTs, but also developing a cadre of talented investigators prepared
to carry on this work well into the future. Thus, in preparing a workforce of investigators skilled in conducting
ePCTs among PWD, this unique Training Core is essential to the collective effort of an AD/ADRD Collaboratory
to transform the delivery, quality, and outcomes of care for Americans from all backgrounds suffering with
AD/ADRD and their caregivers."
10897227,"ABSTRACT
Ibrutinib, a 1st generation nonselective Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi), has dramatically improved sur-
vival for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients, a disease affecting nearly 250,000 U.S. adults. However,
up to 38% of CLL patients treated with ibrutinib develop atrial fibrillation (AF). The development of AF on ibrutinib
is challenging as drug-drug interactions preclude many standard approaches to treatment, and the risk of bleed-
ing when ibrutinib and anticoagulants are combined is markedly increased. Thus, there is need to better under-
stand the mechanisms involved in the development of ibrutinib-associated AF, and ultimately identify preventive
strategies. Recent animal studies suggest that ibrutinib-associated AF involves pathways through an increase
in left atrial volume (LAV) and increased left atrial (LA) fibrosis. There are no clinical data characterizing the
effect of ibrutinib on LAV or fibrosis; thus, in Aim 1, we test the effect of ibrutinib on LAV (primary outcome) and
LA fibrosis by performing serial cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) in 50 patients pre- and at 6 months
after stating ibrutinib. Additionally, in Aim 1, we will measure blood pressure using ambulatory blood pressure
monitoring (ABPM). As background, >70% of ibrutinib-treated patients developed hypertension, and we hypoth-
esize that ibrutinib-associated hypertension may be a key factor in the increase in LAV and fibrosis. Finally, in
Aim 1, we will measure biomarkers of inflammation, fibrosis, and myocardial damage in relation to LAV. These
results will be compared to 50 age-, gender-, and cardiovascular disease-risk matched controls with early CLL
where standard of care is observation only. In Aim 2, we will compare the effects of the effects of ibrutinib, a first
generation BTKi, with acalabrutinib, a second generation BTKi. In animal work, acalabrutinib was associated
with a lower LAV and decreased LA fibrosis as compared to ibrutinib. We will do this by comparing the change
in LAV and fibrosis among patients those on ibrutinib from Aim 1 and an additional matched-cohort (n=50) treated
with acalabrutinib. Also, in Aim 2, we will compare the increase in blood pressure between these two therapies
as conversely, based on our retrospective data, there were higher rates of hypertension with acalabrutinib than
reported in cancer trials. Finally, in a 3rd exploratory aim, we will measure and compare AF incidence in our two
cohorts (ibrutinib and acalabrutinib). The data in Aim 3 will provide preliminary data for subsequent studies com-
paring AF development as a primary outcome between ibrutinib-treated patients and those treated with second
generation BTKi’s. The current proposal brings together a multidisciplinary team to expand upon our preliminary
data to test the link between ibrutinib and LA remodeling (volume, fibrosis), via CMR imaging techniques, while
assessing the relationship between LA remodeling and the systolic blood pressure increase (via ABPM), and AF
events. Upon completion, we expect to gain important insights into the association between BTKi use and the
mechanism involved in the development of AF in CLL patients. These results will also ultimately inform subse-
quent studies testing the most effective strategy for AF control in CLL patients receiving long-term BTKi therapy."
10890694,"This is the fifth renewal of an NHLBI supported Program in Cardiovascular Biology for Institutions that Promote
Diversity at Meharry Medical College (MMC). This program will provide a unique and coherent framework for
specialized training that will focus the considerable strengths and diversity of multi-departmental research in
cardiovascular biology at MMC and Vanderbilt University School of Medicine (VUMC). The proposed program
will support four pre-doctoral trainees per year and will involve 24 faculty members at MMC and VUMC. Four
graduate programs at MMC and five departments/divisions/programs at VUMC will participate in this training.
The research training will focus on cardiovascular biology using cutting edge science and approaches to
elucidate mechanisms causing cardiovascular as well as hematologic diseases. The Program Directors
(PDs)/Principal Investigators (PIs), Dr. Fernando Villalta, and Dr. Evangeline Motley, will provide overall direction
for the program and will be assisted by the Associate Directors, Dr. LaMonica Stewart at MMC and Dr. Joey
Barnett at VUMC. The PD/PIs and Associate Directors will be assisted by an Executive Committee, the Student
Advisory Committee, and the External Advisory Committee. Program students will have an MMC advisor and a
VUMC mentor from the core faculty who have common research interests in cardiovascular biology and will
collaborate in the development of a research plan with the trainee. Each trainee will take didactic courses at
VUMC and participate in research opportunities at the VUMC mentor’s lab in the summers and academic year
sabbaticals. All trainees and faculty in the program will participate in a seminar series that includes presentations
by program participants and visiting scientists as well as yearly retreats. The trainees will also participate in work
in progress seminars and journal clubs in cardiovascular biology. The goals of the program are to attract talented
African-American and other minority students in their developmental stages, to increase their training in the
molecular biology, immunology, and pharmacology of cardiovascular diseases, to strengthen their publication
and grantsmanship skills, and to encourage them to pursue careers in research related to the mission of the
NHLBI. These goals will be enhanced by the increasing number of collaborative research and training
opportunities at MMC and VUMC resulting from the Meharry-Vanderbilt Alliance."
10906957,"Abstract: Late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) targets the association cortices to cause profound
dementia, and available treatments do not alter disease progression. The greatest risk factor for LOAD is
advanced age, yet it is unknown why the aging association cortices are vulnerable to degeneration. Cognitive
impairment tightly correlates with synapse loss in the dorsolateral prefrontal association cortex (dlPFC), which
subserves higher-order cognition. Mouse models have shown that microglia can remove synapses by
interacting with molecular “tags” on neurons, including complement (C1q) and phosphatidylserine (PS).
However, it is unclear what upstream changes within neurons trigger the generation of these molecules, and
whether these mechanisms are activated in the aging dlPFC. The proposed research will utilize an aged
rhesus macaque model with mechanistic in vitro experiments, to identify the intraneuronal mechanisms that
contribute to synapse loss in the aging association cortex. Aging rhesus macaques have an expanded dlPFC
and naturally develop cognitive deficits, plaques and tangles, complement C1q expression, and region-specific
synapse loss. Aged macaques also develop an abnormal mitochondrial phenotype termed “Mitochondria-on-a-
string” (MOAS) that is seen in human LOAD. I hypothesize that MOAS may arise from chronic calcium (Ca2+)
overload of mitochondria, generating molecules participating in synapse removal, including activated C1q, PS,
and Caspase 3. Synapses in dlPFC are especially vulnerable to Ca2+ dysregulation as they express cAMP-
protein kinase A (PKA) signaling to magnify internal Ca2+ release through ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) and
inositol triphosphate receptor type 1 (IP3R1). This process is regulated by the phosphodiesterase PDE4D in
young brain, which is lost with advancing age. I hypothesize that sustained elevations in cytosolic calcium
leads to Ca2+ overload of mitochondria and the induction of MOAS with advancing age, leading to the
expression of molecules (C1q, PS, and cleaved caspase 3) that mediate synapse removal by nearby microglia.
Aims 1 and 2 will utilize high resolution immuno-Electron Microscopy (EM) and 3D EM reconstruction to
elucidate the interactions between MOAS, and (Aim 1) molecules known to mediate synapse removal, and
(Aim 2) markers of Ca2+ dysregulation in the dlPFC of young vs. aged macaques. Preliminary data indicate that
MOAS preferentially associate with C1q and are more frequent under conditions when PDE4D expression is
absent. Aim 3 will use primary murine cortical neuron cultures, immunofluorescence, super-resolution
microscopy, and biochemistry to model Ca2+ dysregulation in vitro and test whether chronically elevated Ca2+
levels can induce the MOAS phenotype and generate the molecules mediating synapse removal. Relevant in
vitro findings will be cross-validated in the macaque tissue. Identification of the intraneuronal events that lead
to synapse loss in the vulnerable aging cortex will provide key insights into how advancing age contributes to
LOAD pathogenesis, and help identify potential targets for early therapeutic interventions."
10918310,"Project Summary. Despite decades of calls for increased diversity in the health services research workforce,
disparities continue to exist for many populations, including Black, Latinx, and Indigenous individuals, those
from low-income families, and first-generation college students. To increase representation of these historically
underrepresented (“underrepresented minority” or URM) populations, there is a critical need to develop
programs that strengthen their path toward health research careers. High school is a critically important time to
catalyze interest and rebuild engagement among URMs who may have previously felt excluded from science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers. The overall objective of this proposal is to engage
9th, 10th, and 11th grade URM students in Southeastern Michigan in a community-based participatory research
program focused on adolescent health. Through the Michigan Youth Health (#MYHealth) program, we will train
URM students to be co-researchers who work alongside academic researchers, which will help them to
envision themselves as scientists capable of positively impacting their communities. Our three specific aims
are: 1) To promote URM high school students’ interest and ability to see themselves in STEM research careers
through a mentored summer research experience in adolescent health research. 2) To develop URM youths’
researcher identities, science self-efficacy, and scientific literacy by engaging students as co-researchers in
“Impact Projects” targeting academic, policy, community, and youth audiences. 3) To increase URM students’
leadership and teamwork self-efficacy, participatory research skills, and science persistence by engaging them
as “Peer Leaders” in summer and academic-year research programs. We will accomplish these aims by
engaging a new cohort of URM high school students during each year of the five-year award period.
Participants will complete up to three program components that become progressively more focused and
advanced. First, all participating students will complete a 10-day “Summer Launch” to introduce them to health
services research methodologies. Second, a subset of these students (selected based upon emerging interest
in research) to participate in 9-month virtual “Impact Projects” through which they will conduct their own
research on adolescent health topics and disseminate findings to diverse audiences. Third, in Years 2-5 an
additional subset of students (based on emerging research interest) will receive further training and mentorship
through “Peer Leader” opportunities in their second year of participation. The proposed #MYHealth program
will target core drivers of science persistence: interest in STEM research careers; researcher identity; self-
efficacy in science, leadership, and teamwork; and scientific literacy. Students will directly collaborate with and
be mentored by a diverse #MYHealth faculty that includes investigators, community advisors, scientific
advisors, and youth peers. If this project is successful, the #MYHealth program could ultimately have a
significant and widespread impact on pervasive URM disparities in STEM research careers."
10857144,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are now thought to
represent a spectrum of rapidly progressing neurodegenerative diseases. There are currently no cures
or effective treatments for them. Though separate entities, these diseases share common genetic and
pathological hallmarks and can have overlapping clinical presentations resulting in FTD-ALS. The
underlying genetics linked to FTD, ALS, and FTD-ALS span a broad range of functions, making it difficult
to interpret their contribution to disease pathophysiology. Moreover, most cases (70% FTD, 95% ALS)
are sporadic with unknown etiology. Therefore, new techniques are needed to evaluate cellular
pathomechanisms in the FTD-ALS spectrum of diseases. Because many causative genes are integral to
organelle functions or contacts, we propose to use Multispectral Imaging (MSI) as a novel approach to
accomplish this goal. MSI is a cutting-edge confocal microscopy technique used to simultaneously
visualize up to seven fluorescent labels in living cells. In the proposed work, we will label major
membrane-bound organelles (endoplasmic reticulum, peroxisomes, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria,
lysosomes, lipid droplets) to quantify organelle morphology, interactions, and dynamics that are integral
to cell function and/or perturbed in disease. The resulting organelle metrics will be combined to produce
an organelle signature for neurons and astrocytes, cell types relevant to FTD-ALS. To our knowledge,
this is the first study to utilize MSI to assess cellular mechanisms of the brain. Therefore, Aim 1 will
establish organelle signatures for healthy neurons and astrocytes, examine how the signatures change
upon pharmacological perturbations, and create a platform to automate the MSI analysis process. We
hypothesize that neurons and astrocytes will have disparate organelle signatures related to their differing
physiology. Aim 2 will evaluate FTD-ALS phenotypes induced by a familial mutation in the TARDBP
gene. TARDBP encodes the TDP-43 protein, which has been identified to aggregate in the majority of
FTD and ALS cases (45% and 97%, respectively). We hypothesize that this neurodegenerative
perturbation will result in aberrant organelle morphology and dynamics in both neurons and astrocytes.
Our preliminary findings demonstrate the feasibility of our approach and a likelihood of success, as we
have optimized MSI labels in both cell types and began to examine pharmacological and genetic
perturbations that result in altered organelle morphology and interactions. To substantiate our findings,
we will confirm and expand on the MSI data in human induce pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons and
astrocytes and validate significant phenotypes in FTD-ALS brain tissue. Our study will establish MSI as
an innovative approach to evaluate neurodegeneration and could reveal cellular phenotypes integral to
FTD-ALS onset or progression that traditional techniques have thus far missed."
10763036,"Barrett’s esophagus (BE) is the only known precursor for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), a highly lethal
cancer with rising incidence and median survival <1 year. Substantial health-care resources are devoted to BE
screening, surveillance, and treatment. Gastroesophageal reflux-induced injury of the lower esophagus and
chronic inflammation are key drivers of BE development, but molecular pathways underlying risk are not well
defined. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) led by members of our team identified >20 novel
genetic susceptibility loci for BE/EAC, providing new insights into the inherited genetic component of risk.
Nevertheless, little progress has been made in bridging associations to biology. Consistent with GWAS of other
complex diseases, all BE index variants map to non-coding regions, lack obvious biologic function, and are in
linkage disequlibrium with many other SNPs, any of which may be causal. The vast majority of functional
variants underlying GWAS signals are believed to map to and alter activity of regulatory elements including
enhancers, in an allele-specific manner, and in turn modulate expression of downstream genes involved in risk.
Importantly, such regulatory effects may be tissue- and condition-specific. To begin prioritizing candidate
functional variants for experimental interrogation, we developed a customized informatics scoring pipeline
using comprehensive in-silico annotations from multiple public resources. We selected four high-scoring BE
risk loci for evaluation using luciferase reporter assays in esophageal cell lines, and found that two of four
regions exhibited allele-specific enhancer activity. CRISPR-mediated deletion of the enhancer region at both
loci correlated with downregulation of several candidate risk genes. Motivated by these successes, we seek to
expand our integrative framework for elucidating functional consequences of BE-related genetic variation. We
hypothesize that such variation is biologically expressed through alterations in transcriptional regulation and
downstream gene expression. Our goal is to identify functional variants, risk enhancers, and target genes
underlying BE risk, leveraging unique resources and complementary statistical/experimental approaches. In
Aim 1, we will define candidate causal variants via Bayesian fine-mapping, using the largest BE GWAS world-
wide, and further prioritize leading candidates via functional-potential scores. In Aim 2, we will perform new
transcriptome profiling of reflux-exposed gastroesophageal junction tissues and constituent cells, and identify
candidate BE risk genes and pathways via eQTL colocalization and network-based analysis. In Aim 3, we will
validate candidate functional variants using luciferase reporter enhancer activity assays; identify target genes
of risk enhancers via CRISPR-mediated enhancer deletion and RNA-Seq; and interrogate pathways influenced
by prioritized target genes in Aims 2 & 3 via CRISPR-mediated gene knockdown/overexpression and RNA-
Seq. This study will advance noncoding GWAS signals into functional biological signatures and support future
efforts to develop novel preventive/interventional strategies for BE/EAC."

IDENTIFYING METABOLIC VULNERABILITIES REGULATED BY THE P53 FAMILY IN LUNG CANCER
p53 is commonly mutated in all subtypes of human lung cancer. p53 is part of a family of genes that includes
p63 and p73. The functions of p63 and p73 are beginning to be understood in contexts in which p53 function
has been well established including tumor suppression and metabolism. The complexity of p63 and p73 function
is due in part to the existence of multiple isoforms that previously could not be studied independently in vivo. Full
length TA isoforms of p63 and p73 contain a transactivation domain, structurally and functionally resembling
p53, whereas the ΔN isoforms of p63 and p73, while also possessing transactivation activity, antagonize the
activities of p53 and the TA isoforms of p63 and p73. Interestingly, mutant p53, present in a wide variety of
human cancers, has been shown to interact with TAp63 and TAp73 to inactivate their tumor-suppressive
function. This interaction has also been shown to be partly responsible for gain of function activity of p53 mutants.
Moreover, ∆Np63 and ∆Np73, which are amplified in many cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer, bind
and inhibit the activity of p53, TAp63, and TAp73. Lung cancer subtypes also share ∆Np63 driven transcriptional
signatures (Abbas et al., Cancer Research, 2017). We have shown previously that p53 deficient and mutant
tumors can be metabolically reprogrammed to decrease tumor glycolysis and result in tumor regression through
downregulation of ∆Np63 or ∆Np73 (Venkatanarayan et al., Nature, 2015; Napoli et al., Cancer Cell, 2016).
Although our knowledge on the functions of the p53 family in cancer has expanded, their roles in tumor
metabolism are not understood, and the metabolic pathways regulated by the p53 family members in lung cancer
have not been examined. Our overarching goal is to understand the metabolic pathways regulated by the p53
family in lung cancer to develop strategies to target p53 mutant cancers. We have made great strides toward
this goal by generating p63/p73 isoform-specific conditional knockout mice to allow for temporal and context
dependent deletions of each isoform. These tools have allowed us to gain a greater mechanistic understanding
of the interplay of the p53 family in cancer. We have recently demonstrated that conditional deletion of ∆Np63 in
the KrasG12D mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma results in dramatically decreased lung tumor burden.
Additionally, we have found that KrasG12D/+;TAp73∆td/∆td mice develop increased and more aggressive lung
adenocarcinomas that phenocopy mouse models with Kras and p53 mutations, similar to the ones found in
human lung cancer. Lastly, we have developed a novel mouse model of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) lacking
TAp73, which is mutated in 10% of cases. The phenotypes of these mice are associated with changes in key
metabolic pathways including glycolysis and cysteine metabolism. Our primary objective in this application is
to define and understand metabolic pathways regulated by the p53 family in lung cancer. Based on our published
work and preliminary data, we hypothesize that ∆Np63 can be downregulated to metabolically reprogram tumor
cells and the microenvironment to compensate for p53 dysfunction."

INVESTIGATING CYSTEINE ESSENTIALITY IN LUNG CANCER
Cancer cells accumulate significant intracellular cysteine due to increased cystine uptake and loss of
homeostatic control. Cysteine-derived molecules are crucial for cancer cell survival and proliferation as a
consequence of their sulfur moiety, which facilitates diverse functions, including enzyme catalysis, energy
transfer, and redox metabolism. Consistently, we have found that many lung cancer cell lines are highly sensitive
to cystine starvation and lack the capacity for de novo cysteine synthesis, suggesting they are dependent on
exogenous cystine as a source of cysteine. Importantly, the recently developed cyst(e)inase enzyme depletes
extracellular cystine and cysteine efficiently, suggesting it may have therapeutic efficacy against lung cancer.
However, intracellular metabolic circuits can modify the cellular response to starvation independent of
transsulfuration capacity. Thus, understanding the compensatory mechanisms to cysteine starvation is crucial
for efficient therapeutic targeting of cysteine in lung cancer. Importantly, our results suggest the glutathione
synthesis machinery, an important target of the NRF2 transcription factor, has a glutathione-independent role to
protect cells against cysteine starvation-induced ferroptosis. In addition, the tumor microenvironment has
significant levels of alternative sources of cysteine, including glutathione, cystathionine and protein, that are
lacking in cell culture and may promote survival in the absence of cystine. The central hypothesis of this proposal
is that tissue of origin, metabolic responses to cystine starvation, and alteration in sulfur sources within the tumor
microenvironment influence cystine essentiality in lung cancer, thereby leading to targetable metabolic
vulnerabilities. We will test this hypothesis in the following specific aims:
In Aim 1 we will evaluate the influence of tissue and cell of origin on cysteine metabolism and essentiality.
In Aim 2 we will decipher metabolic circuits that dictate responsiveness to cysteine limitation.
In Aim 3 we will evaluate cysteine metabolism in the tumor microenvironment.
The ultimate goal, and the overall impact, of this project is to characterize key determinants of cysteine
metabolism and dependence in lung cancer in order to define opportunities for therapeutic intervention."

ROLES AND MECHANISMS OF ACTION OF METABOLIC VULNERABILITIES OF SCLC
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) lacks targeted therapies, and with only 7% overall survival on standard-of-care
cisplatin/etoposide chemotherapy, and only 10% survival on immune checkpoint therapy, NCI has classified
SCLC as a recalcitrant malignancy. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify new and effective targeted therapies
for SCLC. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) genomic studies led to effective targeted therapies directed at
drivers such as mutant EGFR. Unfortunately, drivers of SCLC are undruggable, where there are loss-of-function
mutations in the tumor suppressors retinoblastoma protein (RB1), p53 (TP53) and p73, as well as amplification
and/or overexpression of MYC oncogenic transcription factors. To identify vulnerabilities for SCLC, we performed
unbiased mass spectrometry-based screens for SCLC-specific changes in the ATP-binding proteome via
activity-based proteome profiling (ABPP), and in the metabolome (metabolomics and lipidomics) using a large
bank of SCLC and NSCLC cell lines, patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and primary tumor tissue. Further, we
performed screens with compounds that inhibit different aspects of metabolism. Integrating these data revealed
SCLC has highly elevated levels of glycolysis, 1-carbon and purine and lipid metabolism, and that combined
treatment with inhibitors of two metabolic regulators – MCT lactate transporters (MCTi) and the glycolytic enzyme
PFKFB3 (PFKFB3i) – triggers SCLC cell line metabolic collapse, growth arrest and cell death. Genetic studies
validated these findings, and confirmed the paradoxical observation that PFKFB3 inhibition provokes a collapse
in oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). Given these findings, we will assess the roles of MCTs and PFKFB3 in
the metabolism, development and maintenance of SCLC using established (from Project 1) and new (from Core
2) genetically engineered SCLC mouse models (GEMM), SCLC PDX, and circulating SCLC xenografts (CDX)
(Aim 1). These SCLC models will also be used to test the safety and efficacy of the MCTi/PFKB3i combination
as a therapeutic strategy for SCLC, and we will also assess effects of targeting MCTs and/or PFKB3 on the
repertoire and activity of intratumoral immune cells using SCLC GEMM (with Project 4). Further, we will use
ABPP, in vivo tracing (with Project 2), metabolic flux, and metabolomics studies (with Core 3) to identify and then
target adaptive metabolic changes provoked by the loss or inhibition of MCTs and/or PFKFB3. These studies
will define the mechanism by which PFKFB3 inhibition impairs OxPhos, and how combined MCTi/PFKFB3i
treatment provokes SCLC metabolic collapse (Aim 2). Importantly, our metabolomic studies of paired sensitive
and cisplatin/etoposide-resistant SCLC PDX supports the hypothesis that MCTi/PFKB3i therapy represents an
opportunity to treat and prevent emergence of chemoresistant disease, which we will test using these SCLC
PDX models and SCLC GEMM (Aim 3). Finally, guided by our ABPP, metabolomic and lipidomic analyses, we
will use targeted CRISPR screens to identify new metabolic vulnerabilities in SCLC, which we will validate and
characterize using our SCLC models and ABPP, metabolic flux and metabolomics experiments (Aim 4)."
10898020,"PROJECT 4 SUMMARY: METABOLIC AND FUNCTIONAL REPROGRAMMING OF
 IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE MYELOPOIESIS IN LUNG TUMORS
Lung cancer cells and tumor-infiltrating immune subsets activate an integrated signaling network known as the
unfolded protein response (UPR) as a reaction to the sustained and pronounced endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
expansion and stress induced by the precarious conditions of the tumor microenvironment (TME). The UPR
promotes cellular adaptation processes in the TME that initially drive the survival of ER stressed cells. However,
the role of the intrinsic activation of UPR drivers in immune cells in the modulation of anti-tumor immunity remains
unclear. Expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in tumor-bearing hosts has emerged as a
primary mechanism to block protective anti-tumor immunity and a major obstacle to the success of lung cancer
immunotherapy. To date, however, the approaches to therapeutically block MDSC are limited to
myelosuppressive inhibitors that are only partially effective and cause rebound in MDSC numbers as the bone
marrow recovers. The primary goal of this study is to dissect the intrinsic mechanistic interplay between the
sustained over-activation of UPR-related PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) and the metabolic events that polarize
MDSC into highly immunoinhibitory myeloid cells in lung tumors. In cooperation with Projects #1-3, we
hypothesize that the intrinsic elimination of PERK functionally and metabolically transforms MDSC into
immunostimulatory cells that restore protective anti-tumor immunity. Mechanistically, we argue that the ablation
of PERK impairs NRF2 signaling, which alters the expression of the cystine transporter, xCT, and promotes the
accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that disrupt mitochondrial homeostasis and trigger the TP53 ↔
STING-dependent production of type I interferons. Thus, therapeutic inhibition of PERK in tumor beds will
overcome MDSC-linked T cell suppression and boost the effects of several forms of immunotherapy in lung
cancer. We propose the following Aims:
In Aim 1, we will evaluate the role of blunted NRF2-related cystine metabolism in the mitochondrial dysfunction
observed in PERK-deficient MDSC from lung tumors.
In Aim 2, we will elucidate the impact of the TP53 ↔ cGAS ↔ STING axis in the functional transformation of
PERK-null MDSC into myeloid cells with the ability to promote anti-tumor T cell responses.
In Aim 3, we will test whether therapeutic modulation or detection of active PERK, or its down-stream targets,
serve as effective strategies to enhance and monitor the activities of immunotherapy in lung cancer.
The development of these Aims will have a profound impact on the field by substantiating a primary signal
whereby tumors regulate myeloid cell function through activation of key ER stress mediators. This will provide a
mechanistic rationale for the development of novel therapeutic approaches to effectively reprogram MDSC into
myeloid cells that induce anti-tumor immunity, and to enhance the efficacy of lung cancer immunotherapy."

 ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
The Administrative Core serves as the central node for all Projects and Cores of the Program Project Grant
(PPG) with the overarching goal of providing resources and facilitating interactions between the laboratories
involved. To accomplish this goal, two PhD level scientists have been appointed to distinct and complementary
roles within the Administrative Core. The PPG Administrative Director will specialize in providing administrative,
organizational, and communication support in order to facilitate the completion of program project goals (Aim 1).
To accomplish this aim, the PPG Administrative Director will organize regular meetings of the program project
group, plan an annual retreat including the Internal and External Advisory Boards, and oversee the fiscal
operations of all projects and cores to ensure compliance with the proposed budgets and timelines. The PPG
Project Management Director will be responsible for ensuring robust integration of project and core activities with
the highest level of scientific rigor and reproducibility of data (Aim 2). This aim will include the development
of a database of standard operating procedures (SOPs) for both experimental design and data analysis in order
to optimize the reproducibility of experiments across disease platforms and program project laboratories.
Additionally, the PPG Project Management Director will implement clear experimental pipelines to facilitate the
transition of samples and data across multiple program project and/or institutional cores. Finally, the members
of the Administrative Core will work together with Core #4 (Data Science Core) to support the internal and
external sharing of program project generated resources (Aim 3). For the internal sharing of data, Core #1 and
Core #4 will maintain the Lung Cancer Data Repository (LCDR) which will allow comparative analyses across
projects, species, and lung cancer subtypes. As the point of contact for both internal and external sharing of
resources, the Administrative Core is essential for fostering synergy among the program project members and
for ensuring the long-term success of the PPG team."

PRECLINICAL MODELS AND PATHOLOGY CORE
The Preclinical Core (Core #2) leverages the knowledge and expertise from several Moffitt investigators and
core facilities and will pursue three aims that systematically support the Program Projects at three critical
stages; 1) model development, 2) measurement and analysis of outcome, and 3) validation in human cohorts
and organoid models. In the Aim 1, Core #2 is tasked with mouse model generation and characterization. The
Core will use the embryonic stem cell-genetically engineered mouse model (ESC-GEMM) approach to enable
the rapid generation of lung cancer mouse models. To this end, ESCs will be established from existing lung
cancer GEMMs that also harbor regulatory alleles for efficient targeting of ESCs and control of gene
expression. ESCs will be targeted with inducible expression cassettes, followed by injection into blastocysts to
generate chimeric animals. ESC-derived lung cells in such chimeras carry the alleles necessary to induce lung
tumorigenesis, and chimeras will be used as experimental animals without further breeding. This approach
allows for the very rapid generation of lung cancer models having modulated expression or activity of metabolic
enzymes of interest. In Aim 2, Core #2 will streamline the quantification of tumor burden in these mouse
models by providing digital pathological (DP) analysis of murine lung cancer models. As input, histology slides
are imaged at multiple magnifications using automated slide scanners. The resulting high-resolution images
are processed and analyzed using innovative machine learning algorithms we have developed. The platform
allows for the identification, characterization, and quantification of lung tumors and individual cells within whole
lung sections. Deep learning methods will be applied to provide a comprehensive characterization of lung
tumors, including tumor grading and the assessment of immune cell infiltration. Histology samples and
datasets created by the program projects will be used to create training libraries for new algorithm
development. The DP platform allows for highly accurate and rapid image analysis, accelerating the
characterization of lung tumor models. In Aim 3, Core #2 will provide resources and expertise to validate
outcomes from the mouse studies of the first two Aims. The Core will provide large, well-annotated human
cohorts represented by tissue microarrays and a centralized workflow for the generation of organoid models.
The Core will assist with project planning and method development, diagnostic consultation, biomarker scoring,
result interpretation, and manuscript writing. Additional pathology resources will include microscopic evaluation
of animal and human tissues for adequacy and diagnosis, antibody selection guidance, optimization for
immunohistochemistry (IHC), and multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging."

The long-term goal of Project 2 is to define the natural history of the dystroglycanopathies using 
established and evolving clinical measures, with the overall objective of optimizing clinical care, 
and informing and enhancing clinical trial design. This will be accomplished in 3 Aims. In Aim 1, 
we will extend our current work to define the natural history of FKRP-related 
dystroglycanopathy. We follow a unique cohort of patients aged early childhood through late 
adulthood with a range of FKRP mutations. We will expand and extend evaluation of this cohort 
using standard, validated outcome measures. We will engage those who are no longer able to 
travel due to disease progression with remote assessments allowing us to relate motor 
outcomes to real-world endpoints (loss of ambulation, need for respiratory support). We will also 
add additional evaluation sites for this patient cohort to expand the cohort and confirm that the 
outcome measures are valid across sites for the FKRP-related patient population. In Aim 2, we 
will extend our follow up of a cohort of dystroglycanopathy patients with mutations in genes 
other than FKRP. Each of these genotypes is quite rare. We will identify cohorts that share 
similar rates of motor progression who might be studied together in gene non-specific clinical 
trials. We will collect annual blood and urine samples from patients evaluated in Aims 1 and 2 
and a subset of these samples will be used in Aim 3 for proteomic biomarker identification. 
Previous work identified a set of candidate protein biomarkers for patients with FKRP mutations. 
We will validate these in a separate set of patient samples and determine if any change in 
concert with disease progression. Discovery of new very low abundance proteins will produce 
novel candidates for validation."
10809675,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Serine is an essential nutrient for tumor growth, and there is significant interest in starving cancer cells of
serine for cancer therapy. For example, we have recently found that luminal/ER+ breast tumors, which
account for approximately half of all breast cancer fatalities, are unable synthesize serine de novo (i.e., they
are auxotrophic for serine) and are therefore particularly vulnerable to serine deprivation. Dietary serine
starvation is currently the only method of reducing serine availability in vivo, but this approach will be difficult to
implement in humans due to the extreme dietary modifications it requires. Furthermore, dietary serine
starvation can only reduce circulating serine levels by 50%, which may not be sufficient to inhibit the growth of
many tumors. Therapeutic enzymes are an alternative method of manipulating nutrient levels in vivo that
have proven to be effective treatments for cancer and other diseases. We hypothesized that a therapeutic
serine degrading enzyme might be a more effective method of achieving in vivo serine starvation for cancer
therapy. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a novel therapeutic serine degrading enzyme, engineered
human serine dehydratase (eSDH), that is capable of reducing circulating serine levels by greater than 90% in
mice without the need for any dietary changes. Our preliminary data suggests that prolonged serine depletion
with eSDH is well-tolerated by mice and capable of inhibiting tumor growth in multiple mouse models. The
overarching goals of this proposal are to optimize eSDH to generate an enzyme that is suitable for
subsequent clinical development and to evaluate it as a potential cancer therapeutic in pre-clinical models. To
achieve these goals, we propose experiments that will 1) engineer a more selective and stable optimized eSDH
enzyme with enhanced pharmacological properties 2) assess the physiological impact and potential side-
effects of enzymatic serine depletion, 3) evaluate the efficacy of eSDH against tumors that are auxotrophic for
serine, and 4) further investigate our preliminary finding that eSDH treatment induces anti-tumor immunity. A
targeted therapeutic approach for serine auxotrophic tumors that also induces anti-tumor immunity could
provide an effective treatment modality for patients with luminal breast cancer and other malignancies."

 Patient-derived model systems are commonly used to study tumor biology and test novel treatments for
head and neck cancer. These models are established using patient tumors sourced from surgical specimens
and typically implanted into the subcutaneous tissue of the mouse. There is little data available to support the
decisions we make during the initial handling of the tumor samples and, most importantly, how these decisions
impact the results of subsequent studies. Our long-term goal is to improve outcomes for head and neck cancer
patients using valid, predictive, and well characterized model systems. The overall objective of this application
is to improve our use of these mammalian model systems by understanding the impact of choices we make
when we establish them. By combining innovative approaches to study cancer evolution with rigorous
assessment of tumor biology and therapy response we hope to ultimately improve the relevance of studies
using these mammalian models to improve the care of human patients. Our central hypothesis is that the
approach used to establish patient-derived xenografts has a critical impact on their relevance as translational
models.
 To achieve our goals, we proposed three aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the role of heterotopic vs.
orthotopic implantation on the biology of the tumor, how patient-derived animal models change with increasing
passage in animals, and how these factors impact tumor evolution. In Aim 2, we will test the concordance of
response between patient derived models and patients by using patient derived xenografts established as part
of an ongoing (and separately funded) window-of-opportunity trial and will assess consistency in response to
standard treatments over time. In Aim 3, we will use an innovative humanized mouse model developed at
Wisconsin to assess the evolutionary interplay between the tumor and immune system, understand whether
these novel mice replicate the tumor/immune interface seen in human cancers or in syngeneic HNC models,
and investigate how well the response to immunotherapy replicates that seen in patients. In summary, these
studies will provide compelling evidence for how to optimize our use of mouse models of human head and
neck cancer. Completion of this project will provide robust evidence delineating and refining best practices for
the translational use of patient derived xenograft animal models of head and neck cancer."

Memory CD8 T cells with varying functional characteristics are generated after infection or
immunization. We previously defined a population of T cells within the CD62Llo effector memory
compartment that express high levels of effector molecules and continue to persist into the
memory phase. Although over time in specific pathogen free mice LLECs tend to wane in
number, they represent a substantial fraction of CD8 memory T cells in ‘dirty mice’ and
dominate the secondary and tertiary memory pools. Importantly, our prior work showed that
these ‘long-lived effector cells’ (LLEC) are the most robust memory T cells for mediating
antigen-specific clearance of systemic viral and bacterial pathogens. Our recent RNA
sequencing data indicates that LLEC may achieve this through unique expression of multiple
NK cell-associated receptors as well as chemokine and trafficking molecules that may enforce
their strict localization to the vasculature at the steady state. In this proposal we will determine:
1) if LLECs participate in tissue-initiated infections through either extravasation or from their
position within the vasculature, 2) if NK cell receptors modulate LLEC function, and 3) if the
LLEC subset uniquely thrives during inflammation for its persistence. Our proposal leverages
recent transcriptional analysis along with innovative mouse models and technical approaches to
understand the signals governing how circulating memory T cell populations mediate protective
immunity. We predict our studies will expose novel considerations for generating robust memory
T cell function, ultimately leading to improved vaccination and immunotherapy approaches."

Social isolation and its subjective counterpart loneliness—well established as risk factors for poor physical and
mental health—have been rising at alarming rates in the US, especially among young adults. Mechanistic
understanding of how best to build social connectedness to ameliorate social isolation is sorely needed to
redirect life trajectories toward health and well-being. In creating this foundational knowledge, populations who
face higher disease burden—Black/African American young adults, Latino/Hispanic young adults, and those
with less socioeconomic privilege—merit special focus because persons in these at-risk populations often face
unique challenges in initiating social interactions, including discrimination and economic inequality. The broad,
overarching objective of this work is to conduct basic experimental research on social connectedness to test
whether, how, where, and for whom health communication messages can motivate in-person interactions to
reduce young adults’ social isolation and loneliness. Our multi-disciplinary team brings together expertise in
social psychology, emotion science, communication science, and health disparities and will carry out a 6-week
randomized controlled trial—the Keep Social RCT—using our innovative and ecologically valid simulated social
media platform and a suite of rigorous repeated measures of social behavior, loneliness, and other health-
relevant outcomes. This program of research is designed to meet three specific aims. SPECIFIC AIM 1 is to
optimize health messages about the value of social connectedness for young adults (ages 18-29) from
populations who face higher disease burden and then conduct the Keep Social RCT to build a rich empirical
platform. This aim will be met using a human-centered process to design health communication messages that
include peer imagery and stories for an online experiment with 500 at-risk young adults. Messages that receive
highest ratings for encouraging in-person interactions in this online experiment will be selected for the Keep
Social RCT, which is placebo controlled with behavioral, survey, and implicit assessments repeated over six
weeks. SPECIFIC AIM 2 is to analyze theory-driven mechanisms through which health communication
messages in the Keep Social RCT may reduce young adults’ social isolation and loneliness to identify
intervention targets. This aim will be met with longitudinal statistical modeling to test whether and how the
experimental health communication messages improve social connectedness. SPECIFIC AIM 3 is to extend
data analyses of the Keep Social RCT to identify social structural and person-level moderators of reduced
social isolation and loneliness to identify where and for whom effects are largest. This aim will be met with
advanced statistical modeling to illuminate the conditions under which our health communication messages
most effectively ameliorate social isolation and loneliness in young adults who face higher burden of disease.
Taken together, this research will provide a framework to identify intervention targets to guide subsequent
translational work undertaken to reduce disparities in health that have been growing larger across the US."

Metastasis, the primary cause of breast cancer-related mortality, is a multistep process culminating with the
formation of tumor foci within distant organs. However, only a subpopulation of cancer cells within the primary
tumor microenvironment is capable of completing the entire metastatic cascade, which includes intravasation,
survival in circulation, extravasation, and tumor growth at distant sites. Currently, there are no curative
treatments for metastatic breast cancer. Understanding the factors that induce a pro-metastatic cancer cell
phenotype and cancer cell dissemination mechanisms is key to developing life-saving therapies against this
deadly disease. We identified a population of highly invasive, non-proliferating, non-apoptotic, chemo-resistant
cancer cells capable of intravasation. These cells express high levels of MenaINV, a pro-metastatic isoform of
the actin-regulatory protein Mena, and low levels of the anti-metastatic isoform, Mena11a. We found that
MenaINV expression (published) and a stem cell program (preliminary results) are induced by Notch signaling in
tumor cells by direct contact with tumor-associated macrophages. The emergence of MenaINV-High/Mena11aLow
stem cells may be one of the crucial steps to metastasis because these cells are not only intravasation-
competent but also have tumor-initiating capability. In primary breast tumors, cancer cells expressing MenaINV-
High/Mena11aLow are able to enter blood vessels through Tumor Microenvironments of Metastasis (TMEM)
doorways. These tightly controlled transient openings in capillary walls were first described by our group and
are composed of macrophages, endothelial cells and Mena-expressing tumor cells in direct physical contact.
Similar micro-anatomical structures are also observed in lung metastases, but the dissemination mechanism
from this secondary site is currently unknown. Interestingly, we found that chemotherapy induces co-
expression of MenaINV and stem cell transcription factor Sox9 in tumor cells through a macrophage-dependent
mechanism. Importantly, we and others found that chemotherapy also increases the density of TMEM
doorways. Thus, we hypothesize that tumor-associated macrophages induce a pro-metastatic cancer cell
phenotype in primary tumors and metastatic foci, enabling them to disseminate via TMEM doorways, and that
this process is potentiated by chemotherapy. We aim to delineate the involvement of NF-kB and Notch in co-
induction of invasive (MenaINV-High) and stem phenotypes in both primary tumor and lung metastases in vivo,
evaluate cancer cell dissemination mechanisms in lung metastases and evaluate the effect of chemotherapy
on cancer cell re-dissemination from lung metastasis and co-activation of stem and MenaINV-High phenotype.
Our findings will provide mechanistic insights into the effects of the tumor microenvironment on the induction of
metastasis and cancer cell re-dissemination from metastatic foci. This will enable us to identify molecular
targets for future therapies that could be combined with chemotherapy to improve outcomes for patients with
metastatic disease which would be a major advance in the battle against breast cancer."

Transcription and translation together form the two central processes around which the central dogma of
molecular biology operates. Both processes are intimately coupled and dynamically regulated to allow cells to
rapidly change or maintain their phenotypes in the face of environmental pressures. Failure to properly regulate
either process can be fatal or lead to serious disease, such as cancer. Despite the fundamental roles of
transcription and translation in gene regulation, the dynamics of the two processes have not yet been
simultaneously imaged in living system at the single molecule level, leaving basic question about their
coordinated regulation unanswered. Our goal is to address this shortcoming by developing and applying
technology to light up in up to four colors both the transcription and the translation dynamics of individual sister
alleles in single living cells.
Over the past five years, my lab at Colorado State University has pioneered the imaging of single-allele
transcription dynamics and single-mRNA translation dynamics. We will now combine these technologies to
image the two processes together. Using advanced CRISPR genome engineering and multiplexed single
molecule tracking, we will light up allele-specific transcription and translation dynamics in multiple colors on
timescales ranging from sub-seconds to hours. Key questions we plan on addressing include: (1) How do histone
modifications impact allele-specific transcription? (2) To what degree are allele-specific mRNA differentially
regulated and translated in the cytoplasm? and (3) How coupled are allele-specific transcriptional and
translational bursts? Using a homozygous CRISPR-engineered cell line harboring MS2 stem loops and repeat
FLAG epitopes in the MYH9 locus (encoding myosin-2A, overexpression of which causes cancer), we will
quantify bursts in MYH9 expression at the levels of transcription and translation to better understand their origins
and coupling in both unperturbed and stimulated cells."

 Women with HIV (WWH) are a high priority population that faces a clustering of gender-based
violence (GBV), substance use, mental health disorders, sleep disturbances, and hypertension (HTN).
Studies on the syndemic of substance use, violence, and HIV/AIDS (SAVA) have shown that these factors
are associated with mental health disorders and adverse HIV outcomes. However, the relationship of these
syndemic factors on noncommunicable diseases in this population is not well known. HTN and sleep
disturbances are common and co-occur among WWH. GBV, substance use, and mental health disorders are
associated with sleep disturbances and HTN, separately, but a holistic understanding of these syndemic
factors and co-morbid health outcomes is not well established, especially among WWH. A syndemic approach
would facilitate the investigation of the specific pathways by which these factors interact to exacerbate co-
morbid sleep disturbances and HTN. There is also increasing evidence about the important contribution of race
and income, as manifested in social and neighborhood context, to this syndemic cluster.
 The Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) is the largest ongoing prospective study of women at
risk for HIV and WWH in the US. Leveraging the resources of WIHS and building on previous SAVA-
related work, the objective of this proposal is to understand how syndemic factors longitudinally impact
sleep disturbances and HTN among WWH who are confronting distinct social, neighborhood, and
economic realities. We also seek to clarify the interaction, mediators, and directionality linking these multi-
level syndemic factors and co-morbid health outcomes. The specific aims of the proposed study are to: 1)
Assess how syndemic factors (i.e., gender-based violence, substance, and depression) interact in
longitudinally impacting co-morbid sleep disturbances/HTN among WWH; 2) Assess whether individual-
and neighborhood-level factors related to race and income impact syndemic factors and co-morbid sleep

sleep disturbances/HTN.
 Led by an early-stage investigator, this transdisciplinary team of investigators is comprised of content
and methodological experts relevant to the study. The results of the study will generate important insights for

US and worldwide."
10887616,"In multi-cellular organisms, axial patterning is required for transition of a mono-layered epithelium of an
organ primordium to a three-dimensional organ by delineation of antero-posterior (AP), dorso-ventral
(DV), and proximo-distal (PD) axis. We use Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) eye model to study the
highly conserved fundamental process of (axial) DV patterning and growth. During eye development, DV
patterning precedes AP and PD axis patterning, and forms dorsal and ventral compartments. Discerning
the mechanism of axes determination (DV) is crucial for our understanding of organogenesis as the
problems with DV delineation results in developmental/ birth defects in flies to humans. Our long term
goal is to understand the genetic basis of DV patterning which is established by interactions of the dorsal
selector genes and the ventral genes. The Drosophila eye begins from a ventral equivalent state on
which the dorsal fate is established by onset of expression of GATA-family transcription factor Pannier
(Pnr), the secreted morphogen Wingless (Wg), and Iroquois (Iro-C) family proteins. In the dorsal eye, pnr
is not the sole regulator of Wg expression. It strongly suggests that there may be other dorsal eye genes
that are yet to be identified. We have identified a new dorsal eye selector defective proventriculus (dve),
a transcription factor, which acts upstream of wg. To understand the molecular genetic basis of DV
patterning, we will analyze the (1) Investigate wg regulation in the dorsal eye. (2) How Wg
gradient from dorsal eye is interpreted for eye versus head fate? (3) Test if Hippo signaling co-
regulate Wg signaling with DV patterning genes in the eye. Given that the genetic machinery is
conserved, we will also test the role of SATB1, a human ortholog of dve in the eye. Our study will have
significant bearing on (i) developmental mechanisms of lineage restriction and patterning that follow DV
patterning during organogenesis, (ii) role of growth regulatory gene in patterning and (iii) the
understanding of etiology of early childhood retinal diseases. (iv) How do independent pathways interact
to regulate growth and patterning in the developing eye? The proposed studies will generate insights into
(1) how dorsal eye genes interact to determine eye versus head fate by regulating Wg signaling, (2) How
two independent pathways like Hippo signaling and DV patterning coregulate Wg signaling to promote
growth and patterning in the developing eye? (3) SATB1 is mainly known to regulate growth and our
studies in eye will provide insight into growth regulation and patterning function of SATB1. These studies
will have significant bearings on understanding the genetic mechanism of early developmental events
during organogenesis in higher vertebrates. The knowledge generated from these studies is expected to
elucidate fundamental mechanisms in patterning and growth of normal visual function and within the
context of retinal disease and birth defects in the eye."
10890827,"Project Summary
Patients are increasingly seeking genetic counseling and testing for genome-guided medical management.
There is an urgent need to re-examine the genetic counseling process to meet this growing demand. Genetic
counseling standard practice is a pre-test genetic counseling appointment followed by a short session to return
results. An emphasis on pre-test counseling to facilitate decision-making emerged with early models for
Huntington disease testing and genetic testing done in conjunction with prenatal procedures with risk of fetal
loss. There is little evidence this approach is optimal today. Shifting the primary genetic counselor-patient
interaction away from labor-intensive, repetitive, universal pre-test counseling to results-focused, tailored post-
test counseling has the potential to improve both patient outcomes and genetic counseling efficiency. Studies
suggest models other than one-to-one genetic counseling by a genetic counselor can achieve adequate pre-
test education. We recently developed educational genetics videos for the general population that are effective
and engaging. In a pilot study we found pre- and post-test genetic counseling for arrhythmogenic
cardiomyopathy led to similar increases in patient's empowerment and that post-test counseling reduced
cardiac anxiety more. Furthermore, genetic information alone does little to prompt behavior change, suggesting
a role for post-test counseling to activate behavioral responses. We propose a three-arm randomized clinical
trial to evaluate two complementary approaches to shifting the primary genetic counseling session post-test for
adults with two broad cardiovascular genetic counseling indications: panel testing and family-specific variant
testing. We will compare usual care (pre-test genetic counseling appointment, results returned by phone) with
online video-based pre-test genetic education with an optional (efficiency arm) or required (flipped arm) phone
call with a genetic counselor followed by a post-test genetic counseling appointment. One intervention arm is
designed to maximize efficiency by requiring only a single genetic counselor-patient interaction post-test with
pre-test counseling primarily by video. The other retains both a pre- and post-test genetic counselor-patient
interaction (one appointment, one phone call). This approach will allow us to pinpoint the tradeoffs involved in
each. We hypothesize that post-test genetic counseling will: 1) increase efficiency, 2) promote patient
empowerment and adherence, and 3) have similar psychosocial impact. Our study will also generate a genetic
counseling evidence base for understudied counseling indications. Our results have the potential to change the
standard genetic counseling model for adults seeking genome-guided medical management to an efficient
post-test model. Our multidisciplinary team is led by genetic counselors with substantial experience identifying
and overcoming challenges in the genetic counseling process and includes scientists with the necessary
methodological expertise in clinical trials, statistical analysis, and bioinformatics to carry out this study."
10861011,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Use of continuous glucose monitors (CGM) has been shown to significantly improve glycemic control and
decrease the risk of complications for pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, despite the rapid
advancements in technological capabilities over the past twenty years, access to and meaningful use of CGM
are not distributed equitably across the population. The continued advancement in sophistication and potential
for improved outcomes coupled with population-level increases in CGM use contributes to widening disparities
in care and makes essential an improved understanding of optimizing use of personal medical devices for T1D.
I am a public health trained pediatric endocrinologist; through this proposed K23 Award I aim to characterize
disparities based on race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES) in CGM use for children with T1D utilizing
statistical analysis in disparate care settings and nationwide claims data. These analyses of the sources of
disparities will inform my pilot clinic-based intervention to narrow gaps in CGM use. This project builds upon
my research describing the experience of Hispanic caregivers of children with T1D, my analysis of
demographic predictors of metabolic control in the T1D program at Boston Children’s Hospital (BCH), and my
training in health services research and public health. This grant will enable my acquisition of new skills in time-
to-event analysis, claims-based data use, and intervention design, implementation, and evaluation. Adding
depth to my health services research methods and establishing a foundation in clinical trials, this grant, along
with the unique environment and diverse mentorship at BCH, Department of Population Medicine (DPM), and
Boston Medical Center (BMC) will position me well to begin an independent research program.
In Aim 1, I will utilize a national health insurance plan claims database to analyze personal medical device use
and acute care utilization among children with T1D with a focus on the impact of race/ethnicity and SES on
CGM prescription and adherence. In my second aim I will employ a mixed methods approach to quantify CGM
use among children with T1D cared for at a quaternary referral center (BCH) and a safety net hospital (BMC)
and conduct a qualitative assessment of barriers to consistent CGM use in Black, Hispanic, and low SES
patients at both sites to inform the development of a clinic-based intervention to improve CGM uptake and
adherence in diverse, marginalized, and low resource patient populations. In Aim 3, I will develop and pilot the
intervention informed by Aim 2 in a 6-month RCT at BCH and BMC to assess the impact of culturally effective
education and patient navigation for CGM use on disparities in its uptake and associated clinical outcomes.
I aim to establish a career as an independent physician-scientist with a background in the drivers of pediatric
T1D care and outcomes, with the long-term goal of providing equitable access to rapidly improving
technological innovations to better the lives of children with T1D. The mentorship, formal training, and research
experience that this K23 will provide will position me well to begin an impactful independent research career."
10889223,"Osteoarthritis (OA), a multifactorial disease that causes joint degeneration, affects 27 million U.S.
adults, and often leads to severe disability. The prevalence of OA is 33.6% in adults older than 65 years.
Despite the fact that OA is a widespread and debilitating disease, treatment options are currently extremely
limited, and established disease-modifying therapies do not exist. The solution generally offered to treat late
stage, symptomatic knee OA is joint replacement (total knee/hip arthroplasty, TKA/THA), and while this
surgically invasive and expensive remedy offers temporary relief, replacements often fail after 10-15 years,
with shorter life spans in obese individuals. In order to reduce the number of TKA/THA procedures, preventive
efforts and interventions targeting early stage OA are essential – the first step would be identifying subjects at
high risk for disease development, at a stage when tissue is not yet lost, and cartilage matrix abnormalities are
potentially reversible. Understanding the complex pathophysiology of joint degeneration, knee and hip joint
interactions, impact of gait biomechanics, are all critical to determine the mechanistic basis of hip OA.
 Hip OA progression marked by changes in cartilage biochemistry has complex multi-joint interactions
with several mechanistic factors, including morphological features, gait biomechanics and demographics.
However, studies to date have mostly focused on the relationship between single mechanistic factors and
semi-quantitative/ quantitative imaging measures, gait biomechanics, or non-objective symptomatic evidence
of hip OA. The overall goal of this competitive renewal is to extend our longitudinal work to determine the
structure-function-connectivity and mechanistic factors that mediate biochemical degeneration of hip cartilage
associated with OA progression over the mid-term (6-8-year) period.
 In this proposal, subjects will be recruited for a longitudinal study (covering 5-8 year follow up) from our
existing cohort (n=184 hips, 92 subjects), with the availability of existing 3-year follow-up data including bi-
lateral hip radiographs and MR images, gait biomechanics and patient reported outcomes. We will use novel,
fully automated and translational methods to measure MRI-based T1ρ and T2 relaxation time on a voxel basis,
which will provide precise and localized information on cartilage proteoglycan and collagen integrity and water
content. Automatic segmentation techniques combined with machine learning algorithms will be used to
analyze cartilage T1ρ/T2 in a well-characterized dataset with quantifiable T1ρ/T2 values on a voxel-level, and to
automatically detect the patterns of focal T1ρ/T2 elevations that lead to later stage OA and drive progression of
degenerative disease (over 8 years). Detailed analysis of gait biomechanics using functional principal
component analysis will utilize the rich skeletal biomechanics data and imaging (over 8 years). Imaging the
knee and hip longitudinally will provide a multi-joint analysis of OA progression (over 4 years) not done
previously and will provide unique insights in the mechanisms in hip OA, connections with knee changes."
10864815,"The purpose of the University of Pittsburgh KL2 Clinical and Translational Science (CTS) Scholars Program is
to provide individualized competency-based training by immersing scholars in multidisciplinary research
teams that will provide mentoring and intense experiences in the conduct of research from conceptualization to
completion. We will also help CTS scholars develop and submit competitive grant applications to transition to
independent investigators. To develop and promote the CTS scholars program we will take advantage of the
strong research training environment in the six Schools of the Health Sciences, especially the Institute for
Clinical Research Education (ICRE), which has a robust training infrastructure comprised of multiple degree
and career-development programs tailored to the needs of young investigators at every early career stage. The
ICRE also maintains a mentoring network, which includes 371 senior researchers from across the University
willing to serve as mentors to our Scholars. The KL2 has been highly successful in developing clinical and
translational scientists, of which many are already in leadership positions. This KL2 is a distinct program with
unique elements not found in other institutional K awards at the University, including a focus on individualized
training in core competencies, multidisciplinary team science, diverse disciplines and research experiences,
targeted seminars, and an emphasis on the entire spectrum of translational research. Our immediate objectives
for the proposed CTS Scholars program are to: recruit outstanding scholars with excellent training in their
content areas early in their research careers; train scholars in rigorous research methods to conduct
translational research; enhance skills in grant writing, team science, leadership, stakeholder engagement, and
entrepreneurship; guide scholars in asking important translational research questions and implementing
research projects to answer them; and ensure close mentoring to guide research career development. Our long-
term objectives will be to: ensure that Scholars complete their translational research studies on time; help
scholars use these studies to propose large-scale projects and obtain independent funding; facilitate scholars'
ability to serve as mentors and leaders in translational science; develop resiliency and skills at self-care so that
Scholars maintain a successful research career. Our goal is to recruit a diverse pool of Scholars, support them
throughout their career, and evaluate and track their success over time."
10888195,"Synthetic mammalian artificial chromosomes (MACs) represent a new frontier in genome technology,
with the potential to transform chromosome and synthetic biology and stimulate the development of numerous
radical advances in medicine. Human Genome Project-Write aims to generate an entire set of synthetic human
chromosomes. Short of this ambitious goal, MACs have enormous potential for breakthroughs in biotechnology
and medicine, such as creating humanized animal models for drug development or for harvesting patient-
personalized organs for transplantation. Furthermore, building MACs from minimal components will advance
our fundamental understanding of what comprises a mammalian chromosome.
As vehicles for genetic inheritance, fully functional chromosomes are faithfully transmitted through
mitosis and the specialized meiotic divisions underlying eukaryotic sexual reproduction and Mendelian
inheritance. Our goal is to construct the first MACs that achieve faithful inheritance through the germline, using
mouse as a model system. One obstacle is the centromere, the locus on each chromosome that directs
transmission through both mitosis and meiosis. Because mammalian centromeres are not encoded in the DNA
sequence, it is unclear how to build synthetic chromosomes containing this crucial element. There are
additional challenges to create MACs that pair and recombine as homologous chromosomes in meiosis. To
solve these problems, we will hijack the existing cellular machinery for assembling centromere chromatin and
incorporate additional genetic elements to ensure meiotic pairing and recombination.
 This effort requires innovation at multiple levels: designing MAC vectors encoding key functional
elements, assembling large synthetic DNA constructs, and ultimately creating animals to test MACs in vivo.
The proposed work builds on recent advances from the co-investigators’ teams in all of these areas, and we
have key tools and expertise in place to build the necessary DNA templates, introduce them into embryos,
analyze the outcomes, and develop alternative strategies as necessary. The most meaningful preliminary data
would be to show a synthetic artificial chromosome that is successfully transmitted through mitosis and meiosis
in vivo, but achieving this step is a major goal of our proposal and will require substantial investment of time
and effort. Thus, we are requesting support for this project without the preliminary data that would demonstrate
high likelihood of success, justifying consideration of our proposal as part of the T-R01 mechanism.
We use mouse as a relatively rapid and tractable mammalian model system with outstanding
opportunities for testing and debugging MACs, and our advances should readily transfer to other species for
applications in biotechnology and medicine. Success in this project will represent a quantum leap in the
development of synthetic artificial chromosome that are fully functional in vivo, providing unprecedented
genome engineering capabilities in animal models and enabling diverse synthetic biology applications."

The generation of scientiﬁcally rich, high resolution neuroimaging volumes continues to increase in extent and
rate due to the advancement of new Electron Microscopy (EM) and X-ray Microtomography (XRM) imaging sys-
tems and data processing methodologies. With the increased availability of these technologies throughout the
neuroscience community, and with sustained investment in new capability development and research program-
ming from the BRAIN initiative, there is a current and continued need for community data storage to support
future data generation, as well as to enable secondary science to help justify the extensive data collection and
processing costs for these data and to propagate new scientiﬁc workﬂows and discoveries.
Our BossDB data ecosystem currently serves as the BRAIN Initiative archive for high-resolution EM and XRM
data, storing nearly one petabyte of public image, segmentation, and connectomics data for multiple BRAIN
programs and for the broader neuroscience community. While the BossDB ecosystem continues to successfully
support multiple research endeavors, as we enter into a new phase of BRAIN programming and a new generation
of connectomics research with 10-100x larger petascale image volume collections, additional capabilities are
required to ensure efﬁcient and performant data storage, processing, annotation, and access for anticipated
programmatic and community needs. Thus, in this proposed renewal of R24-MH114785 we will develop several
performance and scalability improvements to BossDB: improve the efﬁciency and cost-effectiveness of data
storage, support the integration of community tools and standards for data processing and annotation of large
scale neuroimagery, and provide an optimized query service to make it easier to conduct secondary analyses
of hosted datasets. Continued support of this critical community resource will make it possible for the world to
leverage petabytes of free, publicly available, and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data
in BossDB that the neuroscience community already depends on for connectomics research.
The BossDB system will continue to be developed through an agile process to enable inputs from community
stakeholders, including from multiple ongoing BRAIN programs focused on data and experimental standards,
and multi-modal data ecosystem integration. As with the current BossDB system, we will continue to integrate
community tools for data storage, access, and visualization, with a focus on new tool integration for data process-
ing, annotation, and querying. Given the likelihood for more distributed data storage needs as data collections
increase signiﬁcantly in scale, we will also develop more robust data export and local-cloud hybrid syncing
technologies. BossDB is a professionally-engineered community resource that has enabled many experiments
in connectomics and neuroscience research, and the developments proposed herein will further enable more
scientiﬁc impact by a broader range of users."
10894902,"Project Summary
 Barrett’s esophagus (BE) is a disease in which the squamous epithelium of the esophagus is replaced by a
columnar intestinal epithelium (termed metaplasia), and is believed to affect 3-4 million people in the US. BE
patients have a 30-125-fold greater risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) via intermediate low-
grade and high-grade dysplastic states, when compared to the general population. The pathogenesis of BE
involves epigenetic/genomic aberrations (e.g. TP53 mutations), and an interplay with microenvironmental cues.
Recent studies have demonstrated that ECM stiffening is associated with metaplasia (or BE)-dysplasia-
adenocarcinoma sequence, and my novel data reveal that increased ECM stiffness, a critical biomechanical
property, is characteristic of BE pathogenesis. This underscores a compelling need to understand mechanisms
that foster BE metaplasia and dysplasia in the context of ECM stiffness. Therefore, this proposal will integrate
my unique predoctoral training in biomaterial engineering with my new proposed career development training in
epithelial cell and organoid biology to utilize an engineered HA-based hydrogel to elucidate the contribution of
ECM stiffness in BE pathogenesis, and to identify matrix-activated therapeutic targets. This bioengineering
approach will be combined with TP53 mutation (in the epithelium of BE) to understand BE pathogenesis. The
overarching hypothesis of my proposal is that ECM stiffness modulation can recapitulate a dysplastic BE state,
revealing novel underlying mechanisms of the disease. I will pursue this hypothesis through the following
interrelated Specific Aims: Aim 1 focuses on establish a hydrogel platform to study the pro-dysplastic
contribution of matrix properties in patient-derived BE organoids. Aim 2 focuses on in vitro identification and in
vivo evaluation of therapeutic targets in stiff matrix-exposed patient-derived BE organoids. Aim 3 focuses on
utilizing an hiPSC-derived platform of BE to elucidate the cooperation between intrinsic and extrinsic factors
contributing to BE pathogenesis. This work is innovative because it uses an advanced bioengineering approach
to elucidate the functional roles of ECM stiffness in human BE pathogenesis. Successful completion of this
proposal will be both scientifically and clinically significant by defining the contribution of biomechanics to BE
and laying a foundation for novel therapies to disrupt matrix stiffness in BE. The research proposal,
training/career development/mentorship plans, advisory committee, RCR training, protected time for research,
and institutional support will provide the foundation for me to transition to an eventual independent NIH funded
tenure-track faculty investigator, who blends principles of basic biology, bioengineering, and translational
medicine."

Despite extensive research, effective therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are still unavailable.
One important contributing factor for this is a lack of sensitive tools for assessing AD pathology
progression at its earliest stages when interventions are most likely to succeed. Both positron
emission tomography and anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been applied for
this purpose in many prior AD studies, but the information they provide is limited. In particular,
they are insensitive to brain tissue microstructure and functional connectivity, which are known to
be altered by AD pathology. Therefore, alternative imaging methods with sensitivity to
microstructure and function could help in monitoring response to potential therapeutic
interventions as well as support studies of the underlying causes of AD, which are still not fully
understood. For quantifying brain microstructure, diffusion MRI (dMRI) is the pre-eminent
noninvasive imaging modality, while for brain functional connectivity, resting-state functional MRI
(rs-fMRI) is the leading approach. In our first funding period, we have shown, for the 3xTg-AD
mouse model of the AD pathology, that a specific dMRI method called diffusional kurtosis imaging
(DKI) is able to detect microstructural brain abnormalities as early as 2 months of age, which
precedes the deposition of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, the two classic histological
markers of AD. In addition, DKI measures are found to be extremely sensitive to further changes
in microstructure occurring throughout the progression of AD pathology up to 21 months of age.
In Aim 1 of this renewal application, we propose to extend this work by determining the ability of
DKI to monitor, from 2 to 18 months of age, the response of AD pathology to a promising drug
treatment known as neurotrophic factor peptide mimetic (P021), which is known to inhibit
neurodegeneration and prevent the deposition of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in
3xTg-AD mice. The goal is to demonstrate the utility of both standard DKI and a novel extension
known as double-pulsed DKI as tools for monitoring therapy response in AD. Since DKI is easily
implemented on clinical MRI scanners, translation to human drug trials would be straightforward.
In Aim 2, we will acquire rs-fMRI data in this same mouse model to determine the ability of rs-
fMRI to monitor response to P021 treatment. In Aim 3, both our DKI and rs-fMRI data will be
correlated with biochemical, morphological, and behavioral measures in order to investigate the
biological significance of the observed imaging changes. The successful completion of this project
will support the application of DKI and rs-fMRI as valuable imaging tools for the assessment of
AD drug therapies and for improving our understanding of the mechanisms underlying AD."

The applicant seeks this K01 award to gain expertise on integrating social factors and neuropsychological
assessments to examine within race heterogeneity for cognitive decline risk factors in the Black community. To
achieve these goals, the applicant plans to leverage her strength is quantitative methodology for biomarker
data to gain expertise in four critical areas of training: (1) research neuropsychological testing and community
engagement; (2) health disparities and lifecourse factors; (3) genetics; and (4) professional training. With the
guidance from her expert mentorship team and through a detailed training plan, the applicant will develop an
in-depth knowledge in these training areas and enable the applicant to be well positioned to successfully
complete the proposed aims of the K01. The overall research goal of this K01 application is to determine how
social, neuroimaging markers, and genetic risk factors contribute to cognitive decline in non-demented older
Black individuals. Research suggests current “well-established” risk factors for cognitive decline and
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which have been identified primarily in the white community, do not behave the
same in Black individuals. Thus, it is critical to explore potential heterogeneity in risk factors within the Black
community in order to accurately predict risk for cognitive decline. The first part of aim 1 examines the effect of
early and current social factors on neuroimaging measures that have previously been associated with cognition
(e.g. structural magnetic resonance imaging measures and vascular burden measured as white matter
hyperintensities) in self-identified non-Hispanic Black participants. The second part of aim 1 will determine if
these neuroimaging markers mediate the association of social factors and cognitive decline. We hypothesize
that more social disadvantage will be inversely associated with AD-specific brain regions and faster rates of
cognitive decline. We also hypothesize that neuroimaging measures will partially mediate the association of
social factors on cognitive decline. Differences in racial groups may be due to social factors, which members of
the Black community are disproportionately impacted. Finally, it is important to remember that race is a social
construct and is dependent on self-identification, with no biological root. Moreover, recent studies suggest that
genetic ancestry may influence risk for AD and impact pathological features of aging. It is unclear if genetic
ancestry and social factors correlate, or if they have unique contributions to cognitive decline. Thus, our final
aim will determine if genetic ancestry and/or social factors differentially influence the effect of APOE4 on
cognitive decline. The primary hypothesis is that Black participants with more social disadvantage throughout
life, will inversely effect these risk factors and have a faster rate of cognitive decline. We will also investigate if
this association impacts conversion from mild cognitive impairment to AD dementia. Completion of these aims,
along with the training from an experienced multidisciplinary mentoring team, will generate data and support for
a future R01 application collecting data from members of the Black community in Los Angeles County."

Dr. Sunjae Bae is an Assistant Professor of Surgery and Population Health at NYU Grossman School of
Medicine. He completed his PhD in epidemiology and Master’s in biostatistics at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg
School of Public Health. Prior to his research training, he received his medical education at Kyung Hee
University and practiced as a clinician. His previous research has focused on immunosuppression and clinical
outcomes after kidney transplantation (KT), with the support from the American Society of Nephrology and
Mogam Science Scholarship Foundation.
Dr. Bae’s long-term goal is to help >230,000 KT recipients live longer and healthier by creating an evidence-
based, patient-centered tool for determining the ideal immunosuppression regimen. Lifelong
immunosuppression is a defining feature in the care of KT recipients. Immunosuppression is the primary
intervention to prevent acute rejection; however, it causes various side effects, notably 2.1- to 6.2-fold risk of
infections, cancers, and cardiovascular diseases, which collectively account for >65% of deaths in this
population. Since the risks of acute rejection and immunosuppression-related side effects are unique in each
recipient, the selection of the immunosuppression regimen should be individualized according to the recipient’s
unique risk profile.
The transplant community has long recognized the importance of immunosuppression individualization.
However, there is little scientific evidence guiding how it should be done, mainly due to 3 methodological
challenges. First, traditional analytic methods are ineffective in providing individualized predictions of the risks
and benefits after immunosuppression. Second, a method to objectively assess the risk-benefit balance from
patients’ perspectives is lacking. Lastly, the new individualization protocol must be clinically relevant. However,
given the lack of consensus on how the individualization should be done, the relevance of a new protocol
cannot be assessed objectively.
This K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will enable Dr. Bae to expand his research skillset
and lay the groundwork for addressing these 3 challenges. We propose the following approaches. First, we will
create a machine learning-based individualized risk prediction model that can process statistical interactions
efficiently and transparently. Second, we will conduct interviews and paired-comparison surveys to quantify the
patients’ viewpoints on the risk-benefit balance, e.g., how much reduction in acute rejection is worth risking a
10% increase in type 2 diabetes. Third, we will survey KT clinicians to characterize their clinical practice and
perspectives on individualization. Dr. Bae will enhance his analytical skills and expand his domain knowledge
through didactic coursework in patient-oriented research methods and implementation science, and research
mentorship by a team of multidisciplinary experts committed to Dr. Bae’s career development."
10929386,"PROJECT SUMMARY
To understand complex neural pathways and networks and their remarkable ability to generate human
behaviors, it is critical to precisely map brain connectomics in vivo. We propose to make significant advances in
such brain mapping by founding the Center for Mesoscale Connectomics (CMC). We will first map the mesoscale
connections between the frontal and parietal cortices. These connections likely subserve higher-order functions
such as attention, decision-making, prospection, and executive control. One key, underappreciated feature of
cortical connectivity is its specific variations within a given brain region, further supporting the critical need for
descriptions of connectivity at a finer scale. Unfortunately, there has traditionally been a major gap in our pursuit
of creating a human brain “wiring diagram” at high spatial resolution, especially since the gold standard for
mesoscale brain connectivity, anatomical tract-tracing, cannot be performed in humans. Moreover, techniques
that can be applied to humans, such as diffusion MRI tractography, may not recapitulate anatomical connectivity
at this scale. Due to this gap, we are lacking an accurate wiring diagram of the human brain that can only
be obtained through a multi-modal, cross-species, multi-scale approach. Here, we propose to combine advanced
anatomical tract-tracing (Aim 1), polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) (Aim 2), and
ultra-high field diffusion tractography (Aim 3) to create such accurate wiring diagrams of human and macaque
brains while bridging spatial resolutions and species.
Importantly, we will computationally bridge species, methods, and spatial scales via state-of-the art registration
and joint (multimodal) modeling of fiber orientations. Subsequently, the remarkable amount of information
available in each dataset will be further enhanced using optimized tractography methods.
At the end of the proposed funding period, we expect to have complete maps of the mesoscale organization of
fronto-parietal connections. We will be poised to apply our multimodal, cross-species methods brain-wide,
including both cortical and subcortical circuits. Importantly, the foundation will be laid for computing noninvasive,
in vivo, accurate, mesoscale connectivity maps of whole human brains through dMRI tractography, which will
allow researchers to link brain connectivity with cognition, behavior, and disease."
10889180,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is painful and debilitating by affecting the synovial joints, and is found in over 12% of the
total United States population 25-74 years of age. The prevalence of OA increases significantly with age, with
radiographic evidence in over 70% of the population over age 65. In this growing segment of our society, OA is
a significant contributor to disability, frailty and social isolation. Despite the tremendous socioeconomic impact
of OA, there are no disease-modifying therapies available. OA is distinctively characterized by the progressive,
degenerative changes in the morphology, composition, and mechanical properties of articular cartilage.
Mechanotransduction in articular chondrocytes is a key component of disease pathogenesis, given the link
between direct sensing of the cells’ mechanical environment and the resulting metabolic imbalance of cartilage
in OA. We have recently identified the mechanosensitive PIEZO ion channels - in fact a synergy between
PIEZO1 and PIEZO2, both expressed in articular cartilage - to underlie chondrocyte mechanotransduction in
response to injurious mechanical stress.
The overall objective of this study is to define the mechanisms of Piezo-mediated mechanotransduction in
chondrocytes more in-depth so that these insights can be leveraged toward the development of disease-
modifying approaches in joint-loading-induced injuries, including OA. In addition to our recent discovery of
chondrocytic Piezo-mediated mechanotransduction, we found that treatment of chondrocytes with
pathophysiologically-relevant concentrations of IL-1α, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, increased Piezo1 gene
expression, and that increased expression of Piezo1 was also present in osteoarthritic cartilage from aging
pigs and humans. Thus, the Specific Aims of this grant are: (1) to determine the mechanisms of synergistic
functioning of Piezo1/2 in chondrocyte mechanotransduction; (2) to deconstruct Piezo-mediated
mechanotransduction in chondrocytes under inflammatory conditions; (3) to elucidate the role of Piezo-
mediated mechanotransduction in organotypic cartilage explants and in-vivo. Aim 1 will rely on cellular studies.
We will explore synergisms of Piezo1/2 at the levels of electrophysiology, channel trafficking, finite element
modeling, and ultra-structure, the latter also examining human cartilage from OA vs controls. In Aim 2 primary
porcine chondrocytes will be stimulated with IL-1α for deconstruction of Piezo-mediated mechanotransduction.
Aim 3 will rely on porcine osteochondral explants and chondrocyte-specific and inducible Piezo1/2-/- mice which
we have generated. Various modes of mechanical stress will be applied to cells, explants, and animals, and
loss-of-function studies of Piezo-mediated mechanotransduction will be conducted with both mechanistic intent
and translational/therapeutic direction. The proposed Aims will extend our initial discovery with mechanistic in-

11146297,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is painful and debilitating by affecting the synovial joints, and is found in over 12% of the
total United States population 25-74 years of age. The prevalence of OA increases significantly with age, with
radiographic evidence in over 70% of the population over age 65. In this growing segment of our society, OA is
a significant contributor to disability, frailty and social isolation. Despite the tremendous socioeconomic impact
of OA, there are no disease-modifying therapies available. OA is distinctively characterized by the progressive,
degenerative changes in the morphology, composition, and mechanical properties of articular cartilage.
Mechanotransduction in articular chondrocytes is a key component of disease pathogenesis, given the link
between direct sensing of the cells’ mechanical environment and the resulting metabolic imbalance of cartilage
in OA. We have recently identified the mechanosensitive PIEZO ion channels - in fact a synergy between
PIEZO1 and PIEZO2, both expressed in articular cartilage - to underlie chondrocyte mechanotransduction in
response to injurious mechanical stress.
The overall objective of this study is to define the mechanisms of Piezo-mediated mechanotransduction in
chondrocytes more in-depth so that these insights can be leveraged toward the development of disease-
modifying approaches in joint-loading-induced injuries, including OA. In addition to our recent discovery of
chondrocytic Piezo-mediated mechanotransduction, we found that treatment of chondrocytes with
pathophysiologically-relevant concentrations of IL-1α, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, increased Piezo1 gene
expression, and that increased expression of Piezo1 was also present in osteoarthritic cartilage from aging
pigs and humans. Thus, the Specific Aims of this grant are: (1) to determine the mechanisms of synergistic
functioning of Piezo1/2 in chondrocyte mechanotransduction; (2) to deconstruct Piezo-mediated
mechanotransduction in chondrocytes under inflammatory conditions; (3) to elucidate the role of Piezo-
mediated mechanotransduction in organotypic cartilage explants and in-vivo. Aim 1 will rely on cellular studies.
We will explore synergisms of Piezo1/2 at the levels of electrophysiology, channel trafficking, finite element
modeling, and ultra-structure, the latter also examining human cartilage from OA vs controls. In Aim 2 primary
porcine chondrocytes will be stimulated with IL-1α for deconstruction of Piezo-mediated mechanotransduction.
Aim 3 will rely on porcine osteochondral explants and chondrocyte-specific and inducible Piezo1/2-/- mice which
we have generated. Various modes of mechanical stress will be applied to cells, explants, and animals, and
loss-of-function studies of Piezo-mediated mechanotransduction will be conducted with both mechanistic intent
and translational/therapeutic direction. The proposed Aims will extend our initial discovery with mechanistic in-
depth studies that will increase our understanding of OA in a non-incremental manner, and this will inspire the
development of new Disease-Modifying OA Drugs (DMOADs)."
10870004,"Abstract: Despite the significant contributions of transgenic mouse models to our understanding of Alzheimer’s
disease, NIA has concluded that these models may be “of poor predictive value in human clinical trials” [RFA-
AG-21-003]. As a result, there is a need for new, innovative, non-rodent, mammalian models that better
recapitulate the cellular, neuropathological, and cognitive hallmarks of late-onset Alzheimer’s Disease (LOAD).
These should include models in which risk factors for LOAD can be systematically induced, and in which
cognitive deficits that are the earliest hallmarks of LOAD can be assessed. There is convincing epidemiological
evidence that diet and lifestyle are important determinants of cognitive function, but it is unclear how factors such
as high cholesterol, obesity, and diabetes increase the likelihood of cognitive deficits. The purpose of the current
proposal is to develop, characterize, and validate unconventional, mammalian models that recapitulate the
cellular, neuropathological, and cognitive hallmarks of LOAD. The strategy is to feed male and female rabbits a
long-term, low-dose cholesterol diet in Aim 1, a high-fat diet in Aim 2, and a diet high in both sugar and fat in Aim
3 to recreate LOAD-like pathology and study the effects of hypercholesterolemia, obesity, and hyperglycemia on
learning and memory using a range of increasingly complex tasks – well-understood paradigms that are altered
in LOAD patients and we have shown to be affected by dietary manipulations in rabbits. We will also assess the
cellular and neuropathological effects of hypercholesterolemia, obesity, and hyperglycemia including their impact
on the neurobiology of learning and memory. Compelling preliminary data provide evidence that a short-term,
high-dose cholesterol diet, a high-fat diet, and chemically-induced diabetes have deleterious effects on a range
of learning and memory tasks. Preliminary electrophysiological evidence shows that feeding a diet high in
cholesterol or high in fat can impair a well-known form of synaptic plasticity thought to underlie learning and
memory – long-term potentiation. Published and preliminary pathophysiological data show significant diet-
induced changes in cellular and neuropathological markers of LOAD. Taken together, these data provide proof
of concept, but the levels of hypercholesterolemia and hyperglycemia were high and, although they recapitulated
LOAD-like pathologies including beta amyloid accumulation, they also produced off-target pathology. It is
therefore important to establish, characterize, and validate the cognitive and pathophysiological effects of milder,
more long-term dietary manipulations that induce the types and levels of hypercholesterolemia, obesity, and
hyperglycemia that are more clinically relevant. Our expertise in and track record of inducing significant
behavioral, electrophysiological, and pathophysiological changes by manipulating diets in adult rabbits makes
us well-suited to develop, characterize, and validate these unconventional models of LOAD – models that may
represent improved translational potential by better replicating the cellular, neuropathological, and cognitive
features of LOAD than current rodent models."
10898907,"In addition to coding proteins, RNA plays fundamental roles in virtually every aspect of biology. The extreme
functional diversity of RNA stems from its ability to fold into complex structures and, like machines,
dynamically take input, transmit signal and force, and execute genetic instructions. RNA structures regulate
every step of gene expression in cells and control the life cycle of RNA viruses. As a result, physiological and
abnormal activities underlie a variety of human diseases. In recent years, targeting RNA has transitioned from
an interesting academic idea to a reality in the clinic, with the development of oligonucleotides and small
molecules that bind specific RNA sequences and structures, ushering in a new era in RNA medicine. Despite
decades of technology development, RNA structure analysis remains a major challenge, especially compared to
proteins. Traditional physical methods such as crystallography, NMR and cryo-EM has only been applied to
purified “well-behaving” samples in vitro, leaving the vast majority of cellular and viral RNAs beyond reach.
Recent chemical probing methods provided experimental constraints that improved de novo modeling but has
so far been limited to small and simple RNAs. This RNA structure analysis bottleneck has significantly limited
functional studies and therapeutic development. In this MIRA application, I outline a research program to
tackle the ultimate challenge in RNA structure biology: in vivo determination of structures and dynamics for
any RNA in any biological sample at high resolution. This proposal is based on the simple mathematical theory
that the 3D structure of any object is equivalent to the spatial distances among its components. Therefore, RNA
3D structure determination can be transformed into a problem of measuring spatial distances among the
nucleotides. To achieve this goal, we will develop ic3D (in vivo crosslinking of 3D structures, or “I see 3D”), a
technology that uses 3 new classes of “molecular rulers” - reversible chemical crosslinkers with defined lengths
- to precisely measure inter-nucleotide distances at the atomic level. Coupled with proximity ligation, high
throughput sequencing and Rosetta-based 3D modeling, ic3D enables in vivo global analysis of RNA structures
and ensembles of conformations. We will perform rigorous benchmarking against a wide selection of simple
and complex models that represent the full diversity of possible RNA structures in vivo. We will use ic3D to
discover and model 3D structures across the transcriptome. The completion of this project will have broad
impact in understanding the structural basis of RNA functions, mechanisms of RNA-mediated diseases, and
revealing new structure targets for therapeutic interventions."

The long-term goal of my research laboratory is to establish strategies that allow the synthesis of previously
inaccessible regio-/stereodefined organoborons to ultimately enable the lego-like construction of C(sp3)-rich
bioactive molecules and protein conjugates. Modular synthetic strategies using interchangeable building
blocks are expected to enable a generalized route to the targeted compound class which is crucial for
optimizing its biological activity. Orthogonally functionalized vinylic or aromatic halo-organoborons have
played a critical role in many modular synthetic routes to natural products. In contrast, strategies to
construct multifunctional and stereodefined acylborons/alkyl boron building blocks and their applications for
modular synthesis of C(sp3)-rich molecular scaffolds and bioconjugates remain underexplored. The
research projects described in this proposal will provide a platform to achieve the above broader goal by
establishing a versatile acylboron/alpha-hydroxy boron-based paradigm to open-up access to several
unique organoborons having broad applications in medicinal chemistry and chemical biology.
Acylborons represent an underexplored class of organoborons whose existence and remarkable synthetic
utility is beginning to emerge only recently. We previously reported an unsymmetrical diboron-based
approach to construct rare acylborons including the first example of an alpha,beta-unsaturated acyl boron.
Our recent preliminary data suggests that alpha,beta-unsaturated acyl borons and alpha-hydroxy borons
are powerful intermediates to access orthogonally functionalized, regio- and stereodefined organoborons.
Building upon our published work and preliminary data, we will develop general methods for synthesis and
application of several new types of multifunctional acylborons and alpha-hydroxy borons to ultimately
provide enantioenriched organoborons that would be difficult to prepare using existing methods. We will
demonstrate the unique benefit of these novel building blocks to install rare substitution patterns on
bioactive molecules and to enable a modular synthetic approach to chiral frameworks found in medicinally
important compounds. In a complementary research direction, we will develop a new class of mutually
orthogonal bioconjugation agents that are expected to allow i) simultaneous probing of multiple protein-
protein interactions and ii) preparation of homogeneous and stable bioconjugates."
10876961,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There is increasing evidence that gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) experience dual
epidemics of HIV and intimate partner violence (IPV), yet understanding of the synergies between these two
epidemics is underdeveloped. Estimated prevalence for receipt of IPV among GBMSM range from 12% to 78%.
Emergent evidences demonstrates associations between the experience of IPV among GBMSM and participation
in risk behaviors that heighten the risk of HIV (i.e. substance use). Beyond the indirect behavioral associations
between IPV and HIV, less is known about direct pathways through which IPV may increase HIV acquisition
risk among GBGBMSM. According to Schafer’s theoretical model, IPV not only contributes to behavioral risk,
but also to immunologic change that impacts HIV risk – but all of this evidence comes from studies of
heterosexual women. With the identification of HIV-specific immunologic dysfunction associated with IPV, we
are able to further investigate upstream factors, including minority stressors that may contribute to such
changes, as well as protective measures such as coping and resiliency processes. We hypothesize that experiences
of IPV (including victimization, perpetration, and bi-directional IPV), in the context of minority stress, increases
both indirect behavioral (sexual behavior, substance use), and direct biological (STI) and immunologic risks for
HIV infection among GBMSM. To fill the critical gap in knowledge, we propose an innovative 24-month cohort
study of partnered HIV-negative GBMSM in SE Michigan, to identify the pathways and points of intervention
between IPV and HIV risk for GBMSM. Prior research is limited by cross-sectional designs, inconsistent
measures of violence, and inattention to important psychosocial and structural factors that co-occur with both
IPV and HIV, and may moderate or mediate relationships. We address these limitations by employing a rigorous
cohort design, measures of IPV that are specific for GBMSM, considering the role of IPV victimization,
perpetration and bi-directional IPV, and consider the multiple minority stressors and stress response behaviors
that may shape both IPV and HIV risk behaviors, and measure indicators of HIV-specific immunologic
dysfunction, biological risk (STI) and behavioral risk. The proposed research activities include a prospective 24-
month cohort of 360 HIV-negative partnered GBMSM (>18 years) recruited in SE Michigan. The overall aim of
the proposed activities is to provide new knowledge of how victimization or perpetration of IPV shapes
engagement in HIV prevention and risk behaviors."

 Soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) are a diverse and often fatal set of malignancies arising from connective
tissue with a 16% five-year survival rate for metastatic disease, reflecting the need for novel therapeutic
strategies. One approach showing promise against multiple cancers is immune checkpoint blockade. However,
clinical trials of immunotherapy in STS have produced disappointing results, likely due to immunosuppressive
microenvironments characteristic of these diseases. The STS microenvironment is dominated by tumor-
associated macrophages, which largely differentiate from tumor-infiltrating monocytes. These can also
differentiate into anti-tumor monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs) in inflammatory conditions, but Mo-DC
differentiation is inhibited in STS by as-yet unknown factors. We have recently shown that enhanced Mo-DC
differentiation leads to synergy with immune checkpoint blockade. It is therefore critical to discover additional
processes that regulate Mo-DC differentiation in order to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy against STS.
 One such mechanism may depend on glutamine metabolism. Glutamine is utilized as a metabolic fuel
by several immune cell types, as it is involved in generating biosynthetic products via the rate-limiting enzyme
glutaminase, glycosylation of proteins, and activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)
mediated signaling pathways. Additionally, recent work has shown that blocking glutamine metabolism can
modulate the anti-tumor activity of tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Using an in vitro model of Mo-DC
differentiation, we found that glutamine deprivation blocked Mo-DC differentiation, surprisingly independent of
glutaminase activity. This finding suggests Mo-DC differentiation requires glutamine flux through separate
pathway(s), such as the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) or glutamine-leucine antiport leading to
mTORC1 activation. I hypothesize that glutamine metabolism regulates monocyte-derived dendritic cell
differentiation in the soft tissue sarcoma microenvironment through either the hexosamine
biosynthetic pathway or leucine-dependent mTORC1 activation.
 Aim 1 will identify the mechanisms by which glutamine metabolism regulates the differentiation of
monocytes into Mo-DCs. Isotopic labeling and mass spectrometry will be used to assess the incorporation of
glutamine into downstream metabolites of glutaminase as well as HBP intermediates and export from the cell.
Conditional knockout mice will be used to assess the contributions of HBP flux and mTORC1 activation to Mo-
DC differentiation. Aim 2 will test the impact of glutamine availability and inhibition of glutamine metabolism on
Mo-DC differentiation and function in the STS microenvironment, as well as synergy with immune checkpoint
blockade. Together, these approaches will elucidate the role of glutamine metabolism in Mo-DC differentiation
and function in the STS microenvironment."

Glucagon and insulin are pancreatic hormones that control the glycemic response to fasting and feeding.
Canonically, glucagon is secreted in the fasted state where it stimulates hepatic glycogenolysis and
gluconeogenesis in order to raise glycemia. Conversely, insulin is secreted in response to elevated blood glucose
to stimulate glucose uptake in peripheral tissues. These canonical, opposing effects of glucagon and insulin on
the liver overlook the long understanding that amino acids in mixed nutrient feeding stimulate the islet a-cell to
secrete glucagon. Moreover, our recent work has shown the importance of glucagon-stimulated insulin secretion
to maintaining glucose tolerance. Therefore, the expected response to a physiologic mixed nutrient meal is the
co-secretion of glucagon and insulin into portal circulation. The preliminary data presented herein support the
notion that glucagon and insulin work cooperatively, not antagonistically, to control prandial glucose metabolism.
We hypothesize that glucagon and insulin co-secretion controls hepatic glucose metabolism to allow glucose to
reach the periphery before being stored in the liver. Successful completion of this project will alter our
fundamental understanding of hepatic glucose metabolism and my provide insight for novel therapeutic targets
for the treatment of metabolic disease. Importantly, completion of the proposed aims will support several new
technical and conceptual developments that will provide a foundation for a career as an independent investigator."

When faced with environmental uncertainty, optimum top-down control facilitates attention shifts and improves
performance. Several functionally distinct stages of attention are well stablished in psychology. Recent studies
have associated some of these cognitive constructs with specific brain structures. However, less is known about
the neurobiological mechanisms that transform contextual information into distinct components of attention
control such as selection of relevant sensory inputs, perceptual decision and motor action responsible for
adaptive behaviors in humans. Lack of appropriate attention control leads to various attention disorders such as
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Our long-term goal is to dissociate distinct neuronal processes
underlying adaptive behavior, particularly neuromodulatory contributions to cognitive control within interacting
brain structures. Neuronal activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex
(dLPFC), two crucial brain areas involved in cognitive control are strongly regulated by norepinephrine (NE)
neuromodulation from the locus coeruleus (LC) in the brainstem. The LC-NE neuromodulatory system projects
throughout the cerebral cortex, and has been linked to sensory processing regulation, arousal and attention. Our
preliminary data in monkeys show that spatially selective attention strongly modulates spiking dynamics of NE
neurons in the LC including an increased spiking to attended visual stimuli. Moreover, optogenetic activation of
these LC-NE neurons enhanced attentional performance. Our central hypothesis is that: 1) the LC receives
contextual information about behavioral performance from the ACC, and is activated with increased performance
errors; 2) LC-NE neuromodulation differentially regulates neuronal activity in the ACC and dLPFC respectively
to mediate motor selection, and sensory and perceptual decision selections of attention control. To test these
hypotheses, we will isolate neurophysiological correlates of performance errors, and attentional shifts in sensory
relevance, perceptual decision criterion and motor criterion within the LC, ACC and dLPFC in monkeys. We will
optogenetically activate LC-NE neurons while simultaneously record from the ACC and dLPFC to test which
aspects of LC-NE activity dynamics (tonic and stimulus-locked phasic burst spiking) causally regulate ACC and
dLPFC to mediate distinct components of attention control. The results from this proposed study will provide a
direct, detailed neurobiological understanding of specialized neuromodulatory contributions that transform
contextual information into different stages of attention control in improving adaptive behavioral performance in
humans. This will further expedite progress in better classification and identifying potential therapeutic targets
for various attention disorders associated with functionally specific deficits."

Hookworm infection is a leading cause of anemia, malnutrition and growth delay in poor countries, especially
in sub-Saharan Africa, where millions of people are infected. Current strategies to control hookworm rely on
Mass Drug Administration of anthelminthic drugs, although evidence calls into question the long-term
effectiveness of this approach to sustainably control or eliminate hookworm in populations at risk. Since 2007,
Yale University and the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research at the University of Ghana have
collaborated to characterize the epidemiology of hookworm in endemic communities. These studies have
identified factors associated with hookworm infection status and response to deworming treatment. Preliminary
data using human samples from Kintampo North, Ghana, suggests that host antibody (IgG) levels directed at
hookworm adult worm excretory/secretory (ES) proteins are closely correlated with active infection. However,
to date little is known about the targets of these antibody responses to hookworm antigens, which is a major
gap in understanding of host-parasite interactions and pathogenesis. We hypothesize that host antibodies to
specific hookworm proteins are predictive of infection status, and that a particular class of proteins, namely
allergens, are the drivers of this response. Studies in Specific Aim 1 will validate the correlation between IgG
antibody levels and infection status using 1,002 human serum samples and demographic data collected
between 2007-2020 in Ghana field studies. Antibody levels will be measured by ELISA and analyzed for
associations with hookworm infection status as determined by fecal microscopy. Data from human studies will
be compared to results from controlled infection and treatment studies using the hamster model of Necator
americanus. Studies in Aim 2 will focus on identifying the specific protein targets of host antibody responses
using recombinant protein expression and Label Free Quantitative proteomics. Candidate hookworm allergen
proteins will be expressed and purified, followed by screening for immunoreactivity using the human and
hamster serum samples described in Aim 1. In addition, N. americanus adult worm ES proteins will be
immunoprecipitated using highly reactive serum pools, followed by LC-MS/MS isolation and peptide mapping
against hookworm/helminth genome sequence databases. These experiments will test the hypothesis that
hookworm allergens are antigenic drivers of the host immune response that is associated with active infection.
The overarching goals of the proposed research are to (1) correlate antibody responses with infection status
and (2) characterize the role of hookworm allergens and novel antigenic proteins in host immune responses.
These studies leverage a longstanding, productive collaboration between the University of Ghana and Yale
that led to generation of novel preliminary data and adaptation of the first African hookworm strain in a
laboratory model. These studies will enhance our understanding of hookworm pathogenesis and inform
development of innovative tools to monitor deworming programs in endemic communities."

One in four children (26%) in the U.S. are exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV), with higher rates among
children of
African American
women. IPV exposure constitutes a traumatic stress environment with severe
consequences for psychosocial outcomes in children. While maternal caregiving has been identified as a
critical buffer against the effects of trauma on children, current IPV parenting interventions suffer from
cultural
insensitivity
, and design and methodological limitations impeding scalability. Our scientific premise is that the
adverse effects of IPV trauma on children can be interrupted through an intervention that enhances maternal
caregiving capacity, and which is delivered by community-based paraprofessional caseworkers who are
already delivering services to IPV-exposed
African American
women. The objective of this application is to
adapt an established caregiver intervention program, Mediational Intervention for Sensitizing Caregivers
(MISC), for the IPV and
African American
context (thereafter named MISC-IPV). MISC-IPV will be evaluated
for acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary mechanisms and outcomes, guided by an evidence-based
framework consisting of three aims (Adapt, Process Evaluation, Outcome/Mediator Evaluation). For Aim 1,
(Adapt), we will adapt MISC through an
iterative process
involving qualitative interviews and focus groups with
caseworkers and mothers in an IPV rehousing program
until fit with context is achieved
. Cultural adaptation
and adaptation for the IPV context will be guided by a Community Advisory Board. For Aim 2 (Implementation
and Process Evaluation), we will recruit
N = 132
mothers/child pairs (children age 7 to 11) through the Harris
County Domestic Violence Coordinating Council (HCDVCC) Collaborative of Houston, TX. Half will be
randomly assigned to TAU+MISC-IPV vs. TAU. After initial training of caseworkers, one year of bi-weekly
(every two weeks) intervention sessions of TAU+MISC-IPV vs. TAU will be delivered. Feasibility, adherence,
and fidelity will be evaluated through percentage of sustained engagement, individual interviews, video-based
observations, and questionnaire-based assessment. For Aim 3 (Outcomes and Mediators), we will evaluate
the effects of TAU+MISC-IPV vs. TAU to interrupt the traumatizing effects of IPV exposure on children through
assessing emotional, behavioral, and trauma symptoms at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months in the children
recruited in Aim 2. The mediational effects of enhanced caregiving capacity will be assessed through video
observations and increase in knowledge. At the end of this formative study, we will have established the
foundational assessments and intervention to apply for a multi-site RCT to fully test the efficacy, mediators,
and moderators of MISC-IPV. This project will make possible a culturally sensitive, developmentally
transportable, scalable, and sustainable evidence- and community-based intervention with proven in-vivo
mechanisms of change that may serve as a model for future IPV programs also in different populations, that
address the needs of IPV-exposed mothers and children simultaneously."
10881765,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are regulatory RNA molecules that control a large variety of cancer processes including
proliferation/cell cycle, survival, metabolism and metastasis, and have led the charge in the non-coding RNA
(ncRNA) revolution. My lab has shown that they regulate key cancer genes and that their mis-expression can
be both informational AND causal in cancer. This presents a unique diagnostic and therapeutic (theranostic)
opportunity to use miRNA-based strategies as effective cancer biomarkers AND therapeutics. My general
strategy is a unique three-pronged approach that grows and harnesses the new discoveries in miRNAs,
coupled with the expertise in mouse models and clinical capabilities at HIRM/BIDMC/DFHCC, including:
a. Comprehensive discovery and functional validation in the miRNA space in cancer. Even though the vast
majority of human transcripts are non-coding and the vast majority of disease associated SNP lie in the nc
portion of the genome, we understand very little of their roles in human cells. Here we will discover the key
miRNAs mis-expressed in human cancers and their microenvironment, and mine the miRNA and 3’UTR
portions of the genome for novel cancer alleles. These will be functionally validated in cell line assays, patient
derived organoid (PDO) and xenograft (PDX) animal models. b. Overcoming delivery barriers to cancer tissue
and target engagement. While we have had some success in targeting these novel RNA-based molecules to
cancer tissues, the current approaches are largely non-tissue specific and we propose a program to make this
more effective, testing intratumoral and ex vivo delivery and to ultimately personalize targeting. c. Advancing
miRNA-based medicine to the clinic. Here I propose to use the miRNA profiles of patient tumor tissue to guide
personalized treatment options based on patient miRNA deficiencies, targeting immune checkpoints etc., even
to design a personalized regimen of miRNA-based molecules for therapy, initially testing the idea in PDO and
PDX models. In addition, I propose to capitalize on my proximity to the best physicians and Phase I clinical
trials units to facilitate the translation of our preclinical work to clinical applications, in both diagnostic and
therapeutic areas. I hope these novel, individualized methods will converge on standard of care for cancer
patients in the future. While this approach could be relevant to many difficult-to-treat tumor types, I present my
rationale for starting in PDAC and NSCLC, where I have been successful in collaborating with clinical
investigators to apply our expertise here.
 While miRNA therapeutics are still a novel approach to broadly target cancer pathways, we are the first to
propose miRNA screening with an eye towards personalized therapeutics and integrating miRNAs into
standard of care for cancer patients. As the Director of the new Harvard Medical School Institute for RNA
Medicine, I will pursue all of these goals as well as attempt to harness the resources (research /clinical
/intellectual) of the Harvard community in these efforts, and hope to deliver these advancements to patients."

Loss-of-function mutations in the genes encoding the cardiac isoform of the voltage-gated sodium channel
(Nav1.5) have been associated with the Brugada Syndrome (BrS), and loss-of-function of plakoglobin has been
associated with Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy (ACM). Both diseases are associated with inconsistent
experimental findings, can be revealed by basic experimental differences, often affect the right ventricle, are
associated with intercalated disc proteinopathies, and for both, there are few treatments to prevent arrhythmias.
We have previously demonstrated that another loss-of-function in the intercalated disc protein connexin43 can
be concealed by choice of experimental perfusate, potentially explaining why disease-related conduction slowing
can be measured in some laboratories but can remain concealed in an intact organism with “normal” electrolyte
composition. We also previously demonstrated that induced acute interstitial edema (AIE) is greater in the right
relative to the left ventricle. Since AIE can unmask gap junction uncoupling, we hypothesize that AIE can unmask
two other intercalated disc diseases: BrS and ACM. Finally, if AIE can unmask intercalated disc diseases, our
data suggest that these diseases may be treatable by managing intercalated disc microdomain separation.
In this project, we propose an innovative hypothesis that the concealed nature of BrS and ACM in intact tissue
is mechanistically tied to a newly discovered form of cell-to-cell communication called ephaptic coupling. Upon
successful completion of these aims, we will produce new methods to unmask these diseases in their pre-
manifest stage, allowing for early detection. Further, the work will suggest important new therapies for two
diseases with few effective therapeutic options and poor patient outcomes."

Chronic autoimmune uveitis represents a medical management conundrum, which left untreated, is a
significant cause of blindness in the US and worldwide. Yet due to an incomplete understanding of its
pathogenesis, treatment has often required use of non-specific anti-inflammatory agents that can have
untoward side effects. Emerging evidence links the intestinal microbiota to extraintestinal autoimmune
diseases like uveitis, providing new clues into pathogenesis, and novel avenues for therapeutic targeting. Our
goal is to investigate how the intestinal microbiota can be manipulated to re-establish intestinal and thus
systemic immune homeostasis that has gone awry during the course of autoimmune uveitis. To do this, we are
using a quintessential T-cell mediated model, experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU). We will utilize two
different interventions to alter the intestinal microbiota, antibiotics and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolites
of intestinal bacterial fermentation of dietary fiber, in EAU. Enhancement of intestinal Tregs (cells that usually
suppress the immune system) by these microbiota-altering interventions will be tested by adoptive transfer of
Tregs and in vitro Treg suppression assays. The impact of microbiota-altering interventions on intestinal
immune cell migration to peripheral lymphoid tissues and the eye during EAU will also be investigated. Direct
microbiota effects on enhancement of intestinal Treg abundance and uveitis severity will be tested by fecal
microbial transplantation from antibiotic or SCFA-pre-treated animals. These results are expected to yield
novel insights into autoimmune uveitis pathogenesis as well as lay groundwork for new treatment strategies
targeting the intestinal microbiota to re-establish immune homeostasis."

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women. Over two-thirds of all breast
cancer cases are considered estrogen receptor positive (ER+). Significantly, ER+ breast cancer incidence
correlates strongly with aging, rising to a peak incidence in women aged 70 years or older (elderly). Owing in
large part to the differences in physiologic estrogen signaling and the chronic inflammatory state that develops
as people age, ER+ breast cancer that develops in the elderly population exhibits distinct clinical and
biologically behavior from ER+ breast cancer in younger cohorts. Clinically, while endocrine therapy continues
to be a mainstay of treatment, there is a major push for de-implementation of invasive and adverse effect-
causing interventions in the elderly that do not impact disease-specific survival. Our group has recently shown
that in elderly patients with early stage ER+, clinically node-negative tumors, de-implementation of both
sentinel lymph node biopsy and radiation therapy can be safely omitted without compromising local
recurrence-free or disease-free survival. Biologically, intrinsic epigenomic and transcriptomic as well as
changes to local breast microenvironment all contribute to a unique landscape for tumor pathogenesis in aged
individuals. The interplay and disease-causing roles of these factors requires further investigation.
 We will investigate several key questions in this translational proposal: (1) What factors that arise in the
backdrop of age-induced chronic inflammation may contribute to distinct tumor signaling in aged ER+ breast
tumors? Using patient tumor and plasma samples, we will characterize cytokines, chemokines, and estrogen
profiles, connecting these extrinsic factors with transcriptomic alterations in the tumor cell using RNA
sequencing. (2) Can we mechanistically understand the crosstalk between altered inflammatory axis signaling
and estrogen receptor signaling in ER+ breast cancer models? We hypothesize that the inflammatory
cytokines and chemokines present in the breast microenvironment alter ER signaling through the estrogen-
sensitive NF-kB / IL-6 / STAT3 inflammatory axis, and this may be a novel therapeutic target for treating elderly
breast cancer. (3) Does pharmacological modulation of this pathway using low-cost, well-tolerated, readily
available drugs result in stunted ER+ breast cancer growth?
 This proposal will ultimately lead to a better understanding of the unique molecular drivers of ER+
breast cancer in the elderly. Successful completion of these Aims will provide the foundation for future studies
and clinical trials to better define treatment standards for elderly patients, who are traditionally both
understudied and underrepresented in clinical trials. Further, this proposal will provide me with an exemplary
translational platform and research training, working with a collaborative group of clinicians and scientists to
launch my career as a physician scientist poised to both treat these patients and study their oncologic
diseases."

Mentoring programs are a common positive youth development intervention that serve children of
incarcerated parents (COIP). COIP are a particularly vulnerable population because they are exposed to a
multitude of challenges, including family instability, stigmatization, and stress. A growing literature highlights
the negative outcomes associated with being a COIP, including substance use in late childhood and early
adolescence. Non-parental adult mentors can provide vital support to COIP. Limited research, however, has
been conducted to explore characteristics of mentors that may make them more effective in mitigating negative
outcomes and promoting positive outcomes in youth. With this R03, we aim to fill the gap in the available
research by identifying characteristics of effective mentors working with vulnerable youth. We will leverage an
existing, recently collected dataset of over 1,300 COIP, their mentors, and their parents or custodial caregivers
from 20 mentoring programs across 15 states. The dataset represents a diverse population of vulnerable youth
(mean age=11.2 years; SD=2.13 years) and includes background information about the caregiver’s
incarceration. 50% of the sample were girls and approximately 53% were Black and 36% were White; 22% were
Hispanic/Latinx. 24% had multiple caregivers who had been incarcerated. 46% had a caregiver who was
currently incarcerated and the remaining 54% had a caregiver who had been previously incarcerated during the
youth’s lifetime. The majority of the youth knew about their caregiver’s incarceration (85.55%) and 17% of the
mentee sample had witnessed the arrest of their incarcerated caregiver. Before being matched with a COIP
mentee, mentors completed a baseline assessment in which they reported whether or not they worked in a
helping profession, whether they had any experience with incarceration or parental incarceration, their
attitudes toward youth, empathy, volunteer role identity, and personality characteristics. We hypothesize that
mentor characteristics will be associated with more positive youth outcomes (e.g., lower substance use,
externalizing, internalizing problems) and match outcomes (e.g., length and quality of the mentoring
relationship) for COIP. Several included mentor characteristics represented having a positive orientation
towards working with youth such as being from a helping profession and having personal experience with
incarceration (i.e., being a “credible messenger”). They involve high levels of empathy, as they entail working
with others who might be vulnerable or greater awareness of issues related to caregiver incarceration. Analyses
will be conducted using a series of multilevel moderated growth curves, multilevel logistic regressions, and
survival analyses. The findings from this R03 will add to our knowledge base about the mentor characteristics
that can improve the impact of this popular intervention for COIP. The ultimate goal of this work will be to help
guide programs to identify mentors who may need additional training or support before beginning their
mentoring matches."

 Cystic fibrosis (CF), a life-limiting autosomal recessive lung disease that affects 1 in 3500
children, is caused by mutations in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembane conductance Regulator
(CFTR) gene. Recently FDA-approved CFTR modulators partially improve lung function for the
most prevalent mutation (F508del), but other common genotypes, such as premature
termination codon (PTC) nonsense mutations, lack an effective intervention. Even in F508del
patients, 25% are low responders to the latest triple combination modulator cocktail.
 We discovered that a small non-coding microRNA called miR-145 regulates CFTR gene
expression and blocks efficacy of CFTR modulators. Our previous data show that complete
miR-145 antagonism improves F508del therapy. This project will pursue a more precise strategy
that utilizes an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) to sterically impede only miR-145 binding to
CFTR without interrupting other pathways.
 We hypothesize that ASO-directed miR-145 target site blockade improves CFTR correction.
We propose 3 Aims:
 Specific Aim #1: Enhance F508del CFTR correction selectively through ASO blockade
of the miR-145 binding site.
Specific Aim #2: Bolster CFTR correction through miR-145 manipulation in low
responders.
Specific Aim #3: Employ miRNA inhibition to augment readthrough efficacy in PTC
mutations.
 Together, these Aims investigate miR-145 inhibition as a novel strategy to improve next-
generation CFTR correction. Aim 1 tests the efficacy and selectivity of ASO target site blockade
to enhance CFTR modulator response in F508del CF airway epithelial cells and relevant animal
models. Aim 2 uses patient-derived nasal samples from low responders to FDA-approved CFTR
modulators to test whether miR-145 inhibition boosts individual benefit. Aim 3 investigates using
miR-145 inhibition to increase the CFTR substrate available for PTC readthrough in mutations
that currently lack an effective therapy. These experiments will examine a novel, highly selective
strategy to advance CFTR-directed therapeutics, broadly applicable across CFTR intervention
and patient genotype."
10922836,"Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a prion-like movement disorder caused by misfolding and self-
templating of the protein α-synuclein (α-syn), which spreads throughout the central nervous system to cause
progressive degeneration. Similar to many other prion and prion-like neurodegenerative diseases, there are
currently no therapeutics available that alter the course of disease for MSA patients. To interfere with α-syn
self-templating, several groups have proposed various strategies for knocking down α-syn expression to
reduce the amount of protein available as substrate. Unfortunately, these strategies may interfere with normal
α-syn function in the brain, leading to loss-of-function deficits for MSA patients. Alternatively, MSA cannot
propagate in transgenic (Tg) cells or mice expressing α-syn with the E46K mutation, raising the possibility of
using gene therapy to generate conversion-incompetent α-syn to disrupt self-templating. However, to date, this
approach has not been tested as a therapeutic intervention for MSA. The objective of the proposed work is to
establish proof-of-concept that introducing a single residue change in the α-syn primary sequence can disrupt
templated misfolding. We hypothesize that generating conversion-incompetent α-syn using CRISPR prime
editing will reduce or prevent MSA propagation. Our approach will capitalize on our recent discovery that non-
pathogenic α-syn mutations at residue K80 inhibit MSA propagation in vitro. In Aim 1, we will use CRISPR
prime editing to insert our novel K80 mutations into Tg cells and mice expressing wild-type human α-syn prior
to challenging the models with MSA patient samples. We have shown that MSA induces α-syn aggregation in
unedited cells and mice expressing wild-type protein. We anticipate that successful gene editing will block
transmission to these model systems. Cryo-electron microscopy has been used to resolve the structures of α-
syn fibrils in MSA patient samples. This work has shown that misfolded α-syn adopts a Greek key
conformation that is stabilized by a salt bridge between residues E46 and K80. In Aim 2, we will determine if
our non-pathogenic K80 mutations exert their protective effectives by preventing salt bridge formation. We will
also quantify the effect of these mutations on lipid binding and protein fibrillization. These orthogonal studies
will determine if the K80 mutations are a viable clinical candidate for an MSA gene therapy. This work is
innovative because it represents a paradigm-shift in how we approach gene therapies. Rather than focusing on
correcting a disease-causing point mutation, we will establish proof-of-concept that gene therapy can be used
to interfere with the self-templating disease mechanism underlying prion and prion-like neurodegenerative
disorders. This work is significant because it has the potential to serve as a novel treatment strategy for
patients with both sporadic and familial prion-like diseases. Through investigating the ability of conversion-
incompetent α-syn to prevent MSA propagation, this work has the potential to transform the way we approach
therapeutic development for neurodegenerative disease patients."

COVID-19 was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, resulting in the ongoing 2019-
2020 pandemic. COVID-19 is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-
2). Common symptoms of the disease include fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, diarrhea, and loss of smell.
Complications may include pneumonia, viral sepsis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. As of today, other
than remdesivir, there is no approved small molecule drug for the treatment of COVID-19 and the discovery of
an effective vaccine remains uncertain. Our long-term goal is to develop antiviral drugs for the treatment of
COVID-19 and human coronavirus infections in general. Our central hypothesis is that inhibition of SARS-CoV-
2 polyprotein cleavage results in the prevention and early treatment of COVID-19 before it progresses to its more
severe form. We will identify nanomolar inhibitors of the CoV 3C-like protease (3CLpro) suitable to be developed
as antiviral agents for the treatment of COVID-19 and other coronavirus infections. The proposal targets the
3CLpro, a key enzyme for SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein cleavage and viral replication. Our overall premise is that
small molecule inhibitors targeting this essential viral enzyme will inhibit replication, and therefore have the
potential to be of both preventive and therapeutic value. Thus, our primary objective is to design and develop
structure-based small-molecule inhibitors targeting coronavirus 3CLpro using our established and proven drug
discovery expertise. Guided by strong preliminary data, the inhibition of polyprotein cleavage hypothesis will be
tested by pursuing three specific aims: Aim 1) To inhibit SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein cleavage by developing
covalent peptidic inhibitors of 3CLpro (nsp5).; Aim 2) To inhibit SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein cleavage by developing
noncovalent nonpeptidic inhibitors of 3CLpro (nsp5).; and Aim 3) To determine the efficacy of covalent and
noncovalent SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors in a golden hamster model. Under the first aim, lead compound
3150 and its analogs will be tested in viral and enzyme assays for inhibitory activity of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. An
aqueous soluble form of 3150 will be evaluated in the animal model. Structure-based drug design approaches
will be employed to optimize 3150 for binding to the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. Under aim 2,
Structure-based virtual screening and hybrid ligand screening approaches along with medicinal chemistry will
be used to prepare and evaluate noncovalent nonpeptidic inhibitors of 3CLpro. Under the third aim, top-ranked
SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro covalent and noncovalent inhibitors will be tested for pharmacokinetics and efficacy in a
golden hamster COVID-19 model. The ultimate goal of the proposed studies is to advance an anti-COVID-19
drug candidate to the stage of filing an investigational new drug (IND) application. Overall, the results of this
project will have a significant positive impact because they lay the groundwork for the clinical development of
COVID-19 antiviral therapy and the potential to combine a potent and selective protease inhibitor with a
nucleoside analog (e.g., remdesivir) and if needed anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., dexamethasone or baricitinib)."

 In Sub-Saharan Africa, tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the second most common cause of adult
meningitis, and a major cause of morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV. While host immuno-
deficiency clearly drives TBM pathogenesis, pathologic immune responses can also worsen disease. The key
drivers of HIV-associated TBM pathogenesis remain undefined but likely differ from HIV-negative TBM, thus a
study of the pathogenesis of TBM in HIV-infected humans is warranted and innovative.
 Opportunities for host-directed therapy in this vulnerable population remain unexplored. To optimize
treatment of HIV/TBM and improve survival, it is critical to fully characterize host responses at the site of
infection and identify immune signatures associated with good or poor outcomes. To this challenge, we bring
our skills in experimental immunology of tuberculosis, matched with an experienced research team with a
proven track record of clinical and translational research regarding AIDS-related meningitis in Uganda.
 Diagnosing TBM is notoriously difficult. The poor sensitivity (~50%) of standard methodologies detects only
a subset of those with TBM, likely with the highest CSF bacillary burden. In these patients hypo-functional or
pathologic immune responses, representing opposite extremes of immune function, may contribute to poor
host control of infection. The higher sensitivity of Xpert Ultra enables semi-quantitative diagnosis of those with
a lower burden of CSF bacteria and identifies a group with better immune control of the infection. Our
preliminary data suggest that diagnosis with trace or very low Xpert Ultra is associated with better survival.
 In this project, we propose a new microbiologic/immunologic framework for understanding TBM,
categorizing patients based on the differing Xpert Ultra PCR cycle-threshold, which serve as a surrogate for
CSF bacterial burden. We seek to interrogate this framework by defining disease outcomes including survival
and neurocognitive testing in these different framework groups, while correlating these findings with
immunologic analyses of cellular immune responses in the CSF.
 Our central hypothesis is that CSF immune signatures correlate with key aspects of TBM disease
pathogenesis including sensitivity of diagnostics, disease outcomes, and treatment responses. To test this, we
will perform high parameter spectral flow cytometry and multiplex cytokine profiling of samples from the CSF
and autopsy specimens of patients with HIV/TBM. By comparing these comprehensive immunologic data in
groups of patients with either high or low CSF bacterial burden, in those with good or poor outcomes, and in
the context of a clinical trial of standard vs high dose rifampin treatment, we aim to define the key contributions
of host immunity to TBM pathogenesis. If our hypothesis is correct, the implications of this research are that
immunomodulatory therapy will need to be customized to address the paucity or excess of immune responses."

NCORP of the Carolinas is positioned to provide a sustained, powerful influence on cancer care through
research in the community setting. The investigators commit to shift current research and clinical practice
paradigms based on the outcomes of NCTN research. The goals of NCORP of the Carolinas are as follows: to
engage community oncologists and other medical specialists in NCTN cancer control, prevention, and care
delivery research, as well as quality-of-life studies embedded within treatment and imaging studies; to offer the
adult and pediatric communities cancer control, prevention, treatment and care delivery trial opportunities; to
engage, recruit and enroll participants from the community inclusive of minorities, underrepresented, and
underserved populations; to ensure all eligible participants are offered the opportunity for biospecimen
collections; to inform the community of advances made through research; to assure accurate and timely data
submission and protocol compliance; to participate with the respective research bases in concept development
and identification of study opportunities for disparities in the community; to enhance and improve involvement
of patient advocates by including advocates in research concepts and recruitment strategies; and to mentor
new investigators, partners, and research staff.
The expansion of GHS (Upstate) and Palmetto Health System (Midlands) into the SC Health Company and the
joint facilities and resources more than adequately support future growth and accruals through NCORP of the
Carolinas cancer initiatives. More than 300 clinical trials are active at any given time at the GHS Cancer
Institute and include Phase I, Phase II, Phase III treatment trials, prevention trials, symptom management
trials, and quality of life trials, all of which provide patients with the latest technology throughout their cancer
care continuum. Research offerings across the spectrum from prevention to palliative care ensure patients
receive the best care possible. New research initiatives include state-of-the-art genetic mapping for molecular
targets that enable patients to stay in the catchment area for cutting-edge treatment tailored specifically to
them. Data management is important to both the clinical and business management of cancer services.
NCORP of the Carolinas is poised to succeed in all aspects of the NCORP mission and contribute
meaningfully to the NCORP goals by engaging patients and conducting the anticipated range of clinical trials
and human subject studies."

 Defects in the carefully orchestrated processes of retinal development, homeostasis and retinal immune
surveillance lead or contribute to a wide range of diseases. It is now clear that genetics not only play a role in
these processes but may also modulate diabetic retinopathy. Our short-term goal is to identify and characterize
gene/protein defects and molecular pathways that lead to abnormal retinal development/homeostasis, altered
retinal immune surveillance and modulation of diabetic retinopathy. The long-term goal is to leverage our
research discoveries to understand retinal disease processes, and to identify novel therapeutic opportunities.
 We propose that a high-throughput and unbiased strategy provides an ideal approach to discovery of
gene/phenotype associations in this setting. In collaboration with Nobel laureate Bruce Beutler, we will employ
a robust state-of-the-science and unbiased forward genetics approach, in which thousands of new random
mutations are generated and mice demonstrating retinal anomalies are identified by screening using fundus
photographs and OCT.
 Our approach has significant advantages compared to other existing protocols. Most importantly, ours is
the first and only protocol in which all mice have been pre-genotyped at all mutant loci. In addition, the large
scale of our system and the large pedigree size will also add to the discovery power. Together, these advantages
will allow us to identify and pursue novel gene/phenotype associations related to retinal development,
homeostasis and disease. We have identified over 43 gene-phenotype associations after covering just 8% of the
mouse genome. Of these, 12 genes have weak associations to the retina in the literature, and another 20 genes
have not been reported in association to the retina. This is strong evidence that expanding our screening to
include the remaining 92% of the mouse genome will yield many more gene-phenotype associations related to
retina development, homeostasis and immune surveillance. Of note, our proposal starts by selecting a few of
the most promising genes we have already identified for further study. We will harness the power of
CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, single cell RNA sequencing, co-immunoprecipitation experiments with highly
sensitive mass spectrometry and proteomics analysis, our recently published light injury model and other
techniques to explore the mechanisms of these associations. We will also apply the streptozotocin model of
diabetic retinopathy to our OCT retinal imaging pipeline to identify genes that can modulate early diabetic
retinopathy. This proposed research will advance our knowledge of retinal health and disease, and we anticipate
that it will lead to the identification of new therapeutic avenues."

Ever since the development of Darwin’s evolutionary theory, domesticated animals such as dogs and pigeons
have provided key insights into the evolutionary process, the molecular bases of morphological and
physiological adaptations, as well as into the genetics of biomedical traits. Yet, the experimentation in
domesticated animals needed to obtain mechanistic insights is challenging because of difficulties with genetic
manipulation, relatively long generation times, and ethical concerns. To leverage the advantages of
domesticates while allowing for detailed dissection of the genes and pathways underlying important traits, we
propose to develop Siamese Fighting Fish, Betta splendens, as a powerful new vertebrate model for
evolutionary genetics. This model will allow us to learn about the molecular causes and phenotypic
consequences of morphological and behavioral adaptations.
Betta splendens were domesticated in Thailand beginning around 650 years ago for fighting in organized com-
petitions, providing a unique window into the evolution of extreme aggressive behavior. For the last 120 years,
Betta have also been bred for ornamental purposes and are now one of the most popular pet fish. Like in many
domesticates, artificial selection has led to a remarkable diversity of morphological phenotypes, including col-
ors and fin types, as well as to traits of potential biomedical interest, including vertebral column defects and
infertility. At the same time, Betta present a number of advantages as an experimental system: (i) they fertilize
externally, facilitating genetic manipulation; (ii) they develop quickly inside transparent eggs, allowing for effi-
cient analyses of development; (iii) they have generation times of nine weeks and clutch sizes of ~400, facilitat-
ing experimental genetic analyses; and (iv) the Betta genome is only 441 Mb, among the smallest in verte-
brates, making whole genome resequencing methods particularly affordable. To leverage these features, we
propose to combine population genetics of wild and domesticated animals with quantitative genetic mapping
and functional studies under controlled laboratory conditions. Specifically, we will:
Develop a genomic toolkit in a new vertebrate system for evolutionary genetics; unravel the domesti-
cation genetics of Betta splendens; discover molecular bases of morphological diversity; and study
the evolutionary genetics of aggression.
Impact: This project will establish B. splendens as a novel model organism in evolutionary genetics, help to
dissect the genetic and molecular bases of behavioral and morphological evolution, and provide the foundation
for studies that address how evolution can reshape neuronal circuits of aggression, vital for elucidating the mo-
lecular basis underlying this important trait."
10912647,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss and blindness in the
elderly. Among the subtype of neovascular AMD, type 3 neovascularization (type 3 NV) is associated with a
guarded visual prognosis and is uniquely characterized by vascular proliferation in both the retina and choroid.
A defining feature of advanced type 3 NV is the development of chorioretinal anastomoses (CRA), abnormal
direct connections between the retinal and choroidal circulations. Unfortunately, CRA can act as ‘hot spots’ for
recurrent exudation which are resilient to available therapies.
The developmental mechanism of CRA remains unclear. We established a murine model for type 3 NV,
wherein mice harboring a mutation of type IV collagen (Col4a1) develop features of human disease including
serous retinal detachment, hemorrhage, atrophy, and pronounced CRA. As in patients, CRA in Col4a1 mutant
mice form in adulthood and mature into large de novo fusions between retinal and choroidal circulations,
reminiscent of high-flow arteriovenous (AV) shunts. Recently, AV specification has emerged as a potent
regulator of vascular patterning, and dysregulation of key genes governing AV identity induces formation of AV
shunts. Notably, normalizing AV specification has been shown to reverse AV shunts despite their high-flow
state in certain animal models. Elucidating a role for AV specification in CRA may offer novel insights into both
disease pathogenesis and therapeutic strategies. Our central hypothesis is that CRA in Col4a1 mutant mice
are AV shunts with a conserved developmental origin from either the retina or choroid. We have recently
enabled multiphoton imaging of the choroid directly through the sclera of pigmented eyes using optimized
multiphoton microscopy. The objectives of this inter-disciplinary research proposal are therefore to:
1) optimize intravital imaging of chorioretinal vascular dynamics with transscleral multiphoton microscopy; 2)
determine the origin, blood flow, and arteriovenous identity of CRA in Col4a1 mutant mice; and 3) identify
candidate pathways driving CRA in the endothelium using single cell RNA sequencing.
The long-term goal of this career development research project is to provide the investigator with a cross-
disciplinary skillset in advanced intravital imaging and single-cell transcriptomics that will allow him to
investigate fundamental mechanisms of oculovascular dysgenesis toward the discovery of new therapies in
vascular disease."
10890740,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by the selective destruction of insulin producing β-cells due to
infiltrating autoaggressive T-cells and a break in immune tolerance. As a consequence, the patient is met with
a severe loss of β-cell function and mass thus requiring the need for exogenous insulin. Preventative
immunomodulatory therapeutic strategies to improve disease outcome have been met with minimal success.
Therefore, novel strategies to restore overall β-cell function and health are warranted. Recent evidence
suggests that β-cells themselves facilitate their own complicit demise during the progression of T1D and thus
may serve as potential therapeutic targets of intervention. Chronic exposure to pro-inflammatory mediators has
been shown to induce β-cell dysfunction; however, the mechanisms mediating this process have yet to be fully
elucidated. In this application, we propose to study the impact of pro-inflammatory mediators on the β-cell
dialogue through exchange of circulating nanovesicles termed extracellular vesicles (EVs). We and others
have noted significant content alterations in EV cargoes at the protein and miRNA level upon T1D pro-
inflammatory cytokine induction. However, the direct physiological and mechanistic implications of altered pro-
inflammatory β-cell EV cargo to recipient β-cells have yet to be fully elucidated. The long-term goal of the
applicant is to establish an independent laboratory exploring the physiological and mechanistic role of EVs in
the pathogenesis of T1D. The central hypothesis of the application is that β-cells contribute to their own
demise through diabetogenic β-cell EV cargo exchange to induce β-cell dysfunction and enhancement of
antigen processing and presentation. To test this hypothesis, two specific aims have been proposed which are
backed by extensive preliminary data. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that pro-inflammatory β-cell EVs
activate the CXCL10:CXCR3 axis to induce β-cell failure. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that pro-
inflammatory β-cell EVs contribute to β-cell immunomodulation during the pathogenesis of T1D. Both Aims will
use ex vivo and in vivo mouse models of T1D and human islets and cell lines to address the hypotheses. The
applicant is part of the highly collaborative Islet Regeneration Center (Center for Regenerative Medicine) at
Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN. This outstanding research environment in addition to a carefully selected
mentoring committee comprised of established NIH-funded investigators will provide the applicant with the
necessary tools and support to establish herself as an independent research investigator."

 Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common non-communicable disease and the leading cause
of morbidity and mortality in Haiti. It has surpassed infectious diseases over the past decade. Hypertension
(HTN) is the single most common CVD risk factor in Haitian adults and its onset is 10-20 years earlier than
among Black Americans in the US. Potential drivers of HTN in Haiti include social determinants such as
extreme poverty, food insecurity, a high salt diet, psychological stress, and also environmental pollutants such
as high lead exposure. Concurrently, Haiti continues to have the highest HIV prevalence in the region with over
35% of persons living with HIV having HTN. To curb this alarming CVD epidemic, Haiti urgently needs CVD
research training for both young investigators and research staff in order to increase its capacity to conduct
interdisciplinary, impactful CVD research.
 This proposal builds on a ~40-year history in Haiti of NIH research and Fogarty training by the Groupe
d’Etude du Sarcome et des Infections Opportunistes (GHESKIO) and its US collaborating partner, Weill Cornell
Medicine. The Cornell-GHESKIO partnership began with a focus on HIV and since 2015 has expanded to
address the CVD epidemic in Haiti. We have built a strong foundation with 8 active NIH and foundation grants
in CVD research and the creation of the GHESKIO NCD Clinical and Research Unit. We now need to train a
skilled workforce of specialized CVD researchers who can expand Haiti’s research portfolio and transform
research findings into practice.
 The goal of this training program is to strengthen research that will ultimately improve CVD-related
health outcomes in Haiti and the world. Our three training objectives include: 1) to provide long-term mentored
CVD research training to 8 Haitian clinician scientists through MPH coursework at Quisqueya University with
mentored CVD research in Haiti; 2) to train 24 medium-term research staff in CVD knowledge and technical
research skills through a new 1-year CVD Core Research Course taught by Haitian and international faculty;
and 3) to establish a CVD Implementation Network of 6 CVD clinics to increase the uptake, optimization, and
evaluation of high-impact CVD interventions in Haiti. Staff at the Network clinics will have opportunities for
short-term training including participation in monthly CVD Grand Rounds and participation in 1-week
workshops within the CVD Core Research Course. In addition, we will sponsor an annual national CVD
Research Conference with a focus on trainee leadership and career development. The proposed program is
the first CVD research training program in Haiti and brings innovation in CVD coursework, new research
mentors and faculty, and a platform for building implementation capacity for CVD interventions across the
country. We are committed to training the next generation of CVD researchers in Haiti."
10873933,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TEI) has been observed in worms, flies, and mice, and proposed
in humans (e.g., Dutch Hunger Winter), but the underlying and regulatory molecular mechanisms are largely
unknown. Similarly, we do not yet understand how ubiquitous trans-kingdom signaling between pathogens and
hosts is. Therefore, it is critical to study these mechanisms in model systems.
 We recently discovered that the nematode C. elegans, which both eats and is infected by bacteria, can
survey its environment, detect and learn to avoid pathogens, and then pass this information on to four
generations of its progeny (Moore, et al., Cell 2019); we propose that this is a nascent form of adaptive immunity.
Well-conserved molecular processes (RNA interference, COMPASS histone modification, piRNAs) across
several tissues (intestine, germline, and neurons) are required to alter behavior in response to Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (PA14). Worms ""read"" small RNA bacterial signals, interpret this information as a predictor of future
infection, and transmit the information to alter behavior by downregulating a neuronal gene with complementary
sequence (Kaletsky, et al. BioRxiv 2020; Kaletsky et al. Nature, in press).
 How is the sRNA signal conveyed from the germline to neurons? We found that the
Ty3/Gypsy retrotransposon Cer1 is required for learned pathogenic avoidance, TEI, and survival on PA14. This
is paradigm shifting: conventional wisdom holds that retrotransposons are deleterious, and that piRNAs
are critical to repress these genomic parasites. Our results instead suggest that Cer1 may have been selected to
fight against the most abundant pathogens in C. elegans' environment. We hypothesize that Cer1 forms vesicle-
like particles that carry sRNAs to neurons. Proposed experiments will characterize the nature of the germline-to-
neuron signal, determine the evolutionary conservation of the mechanism, and determine how the
transgenerational “clock” is sett. Because the molecular components we have already observed are conserved,
our results will identify candidate molecular requirements for TEI in other animals."

research using Xenopus into knowledge that will impact human health. Our goals are to enable
research using Xenopus, make high-quality curated data available to Xenopus researchers,
facilitate the dissemination of Xenopus data to the broader biomedical community, and to help
improve data literacy in the Xenopus community. We follow the FAIR data management principles
which aim to make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. We curate data, link
data from Xenopus to humans and model organisms and provide curated datasets to external
resources including: NCBI, UCSC, GO Consortium, UniProt, Ensembl and other model organism
knowledgebases (MOKs). We plan to establish new exchanges with a number of resources such
as the Monarch Initiative, the Alliance of Genomic Resources (AGR), DIOPT and the European
Bioinformatics Institute. All our code, bio-informatic pipelines and processed data reports are
freely available. Xenbase also provides critical data-sharing infrastructure for many other NIH-
funded projects, most notably the Xenopus genomes. Xenbase has also become a focal point for
the Xenopus community and we provide outreach, education, and training activities. In sum,
Xenbase has become the single most important clearing house of data from Xenopus research
and the communication hub for the Xenopus community.
Aim 1. Continue open access dissemination of Xenbase content using the FAIR principles.
Aim 2. Enhance dissemination by improving the user interfaces and data-sharing infrastructure.
Aim 3. Community Communication, Outreach, and Training."
10675060,"Currently, 7 million US stroke survivors have significant disability, more than half with residual motor deficits. Motor function, particularly of the upper extremity (UE), is critical for regaining independence after stroke. UE function largely depends on integrity of motor cortex and its descending fibers, collectively termed the corticomotor system (CMS). Validated, clinically relevant biomarkers that identify biologically distinct patient subgroups are critically needed, particularly for the often affected and functionally important CMS. Their absence is a major obstacle to developing and personalizing new recovery therapies, especially in the early days post- stroke. Presence or absence of motor evoked potential (MEP) responses to TMS and extent of MRI-measured acute lesion load involving corticospinal tract (CST) are ready for formal validation. Also, the Predict Recovery Potential (PREP)-2 prediction tool, which sequentially combines acute clinical information and MEP status, is primed for multi-site validation. Our current objective, well-aligned with StrokeNet’s, is to validate the most biologically relevant and primed biomarkers of 90-day UE motor outcomes after ischemic stroke in the first large- scale, prospective, acute dataset of clinical, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and MRI measures. The central hypothesis is that patients have different UE outcomes depending on CMS function measured with TMS, and on CST injury measured with MRI. The proposed study, “Validation of Early Prognostic Data for Recovery Outcomes after Stroke for Future, Higher Yield Trials” (VERIFY), will collect data from 657 patients at 30 US sites to address the following specific aims. Aim 1: To externally validate the relationships that TMS and MRI biomarkers of CMS integrity acquired < 7 days after stroke have with UE motor impairment outcome at 90 days after ischemic stroke. Aim 2: To externally validate the PREP2 prediction tool used < 7 days after stroke to predict 90-day UE functional outcome for individual patients with ischemic stroke. Our multi-dimensional approach to UE motor outcomes is an innovative advance on previous biomarker studies, which were typically limited to predicting outcomes in one or two domains. We will comprehensively measure UE outcomes 90 days post-stroke in three domains of motor performance —impairment, function, and use — identified by the World Health Organization International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. Our cross-disciplinary team has established expertise in multicenter acute trials, neurophysiology, neuroimaging, and stroke recovery and rehabilitation. The results are expected to have a positive impact because biomarkers used in the acute stroke period to identify patient subgroups with distinct day-90 outcomes can aid stroke recovery trials and inform rehabilitation decision-making."
10893374,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Successful reproduction through the fusion of the sperm and oocyte is essential for the perpetuation of species.
In human females, oocytes complete meiosis I at birth, and enter a long period of meiotic II arrest until
onset of meiotic maturation at puberty. Because the oocytes are quiescent and arrested during this period,
RNAs are loaded into the developing oocytes prior to the arrest and these RNAs are critical for early
embryonic development. Mechanisms that regulate generation and protection (from degradation) of
maternal RNAs during the long meiotic arrest as well as mechanisms that regulate the degradation of these
RNAs in the embryo remain an active area of investigation. Our work in C. elegans and work from mammalian
models in the past few years turned the light on regulation of the maternal transcriptome which dictates oocyte
quality and impacts progeny development. Specifically, we uncovered a direct link between RAS/ERK growth
factor signaling and the small RNA biogenesis factors Dicer1, Drosha and DIS3 (an RNA exosomal component)
which regulates distinct populations of small non-coding RNAs and thus the maternal transcriptome and
proteome. We propose a model wherein ERK-mediated phosphorylation of Dicer1 (and a subsequent arginine
methylation of Dicer1), phosphorylation of Drosha and DIS3 results in a regulatory circuit that fine tunes the
generation of small non-coding RNAs in specific subsets and regulates the maternal and zygotic transcriptome
and proteome. We investigate this model in vivo during oocyte development and oocyte-to-embryo transition
using a combination of live imaging, next generation sequencing, single oocyte sequencing, mass spectrometric
and proteomic methods, CRISPR Cas9 genome editing and cell biological assays. We find that Dicer1, Drosha
and Dis3 are phosphorylated in mammals as well. Additionally, we identified arginine methylation of Dicer1
adjacent to the phosphorylation event in mammalian cell culture system. Given their conserved role in RNA
biology, reproduction and their aberrations associated with cancer onset and progression, we expect this work
to have direct relevance to human biology."

To sense the environment, cells rely on membrane-embedded receptors. The receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)
family of signaling proteins is large, diverse, and centrally important both to human development diseases and
cancers. Evidence so far supports a model that signal passage through RTKs is initiated by a structural change
in the extracellular domain and then conducted through the transmembrane (TMD) and juxtamembrane (JMD)
domains to the cytoplasmic kinase domain. The receptors usually are activated in the dimer form. Numerous
RTK mutations confer diseases, e.g. single point mutations in ~30% of residues of the TMD of the fibroblast
growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) are pathogenic, while mutations of tropomyosin receptor kinase A can lead
to cancers. Understanding the structural interactions of the FGFR3 and TrkA signaling TMD and JMD therefore
is crucial for fundamental biology and for future development of therapies that may target these pathways.
Atomistically resolved TMD+JMD dimer structures are the major objective of this project. Application of
traditional computational and crystallographic methods is hindered by the fluid nature of the membrane
environment. Our goal is to develop novel efficient computational methods that guide and maximally leverage
NMR, FRET, and in-cell experimental data and apply these methods to capture the FGFR3 and TrkA TMD and
TMD+JMD dimer structures for the wild type and mutated pathogenic forms. In Aim 1, we will combine our
novel highly mobile membrane mimetic model, capable of spontaneously capturing candidate TMD dimer
structures, with a novel minimally biased way of applying a reduced number of computational restraints based
on experimental distance measurements. The resulting TMD dimer structures will be validated by comparing
computed and experimentally measured parameters. These structures will reveal the role mutations play in
RTK dynamics. In Aim 2, we will use our computational-experimental approach to determine the role that
juxtamembrane domains play in RTK signaling. The resolved structures of the mutated dimers will facilitate
understanding of the pathology and mechanisms of receptor activation. Our novel computational approaches
combined with extended expertise of co-investigators and collaborators in NMR, FRET, RTK signaling, and
membrane-associated phenomena, uniquely position us to develop and apply this methodology. We will also
develop an open-source, user friendly workflow plugin for a widely-used software suite that will allow efficient
use of the proposed protocols by the scientific community. Completion of the specific aims will increase our
ability to efficiently gain structural information on RTKs and will open new research avenues for investigating
mechanisms of transmembrane signaling in health and disease leading to development of new treatments."
10880302,"Recent evidence put forth by our group and others suggests type 1 diabetes (T1D) pathogenesis involves a
combination of immune, islet, and acinar pancreas defects. In addition to autoimmunity and β-cell death, it has
become clear that T1D is characterized by a whole-organ pathology with reduced pancreas size, reduced
exocrine enzyme levels in serum, and altered α- and β-cell function, including impaired insulin processing, even
in the islet autoantibody positive (AAb+) pre-T1D condition. Hence, there is a need to understand each of these
facets in concert, linking cellular phenotype and function, together with studies of the human pancreas tissue
microenvironment, throughout T1D progression. We hypothesize that alterations to β-cell status and its
surrounding environment are key determinants of impaired β-cell function, exocrine function, and infiltration
(insulitis). We propose to assay islet and acinar tissue function using our novel pancreas slice culture platform
(Aim 1a) to test (pro)hormone (proinsulin, insulin, glucagon) and enzyme (lipase, trypsinogen) secretion from
T1D, AAb+, and control organ donor pancreata in response to established endocrine (glucose, arginine, KCl)
and exocrine stimuli (cholecystokinin, carbachol). We will correlate these functional data with molecular features
via scRNAseq (single cell RNA sequencing) with antibody-based CITEseq (Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes
and Epitopes) and scATACseq (single cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing); this, for the
purpose of cell identification together with transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses (Aims 1b). Pancreas slices
will also be subjected to these same stimulatory conditions for live cellular imaging of Ca2+ signalling activity
within islet and acinar tissue areas in real time (Aim 2a), then fixed and analyzed by imaging mass cytometry
(IMC). We will assess in situ expression of 120 immune and pancreas cell markers with cellular resolution (Aim
2b), followed by spatial and temporal analysis of IMC data to determine how islet, immune and acinar cell
phenotypes correlate with tissue and cellular function, using our histoCAT (histology topography cytometry
analysis toolbox). This will enable computational analysis with 3D reconstruction from serial sections (Aim 2c).
Finally, in Aim 3, human donor pancreas slices will be subjected to diabetogenic stimuli (inflammatory cytokines,
glucotoxicity) and interventions targeting β-cell stress [imatinib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor), MSL-7 (autophagy
enhancer), exenatide (GLP-1 receptor agonist)], and similarly evaluated by single cell and IMC profiling. With
over 14 years of experience in procurement of transplant-quality human pancreata through the Network for
Pancreatic Organ donors with Diabetes (nPOD), we are uniquely poised to perform the proposed studies. We
expect to identify altered molecular pathways and tissue features linking β-cell, whole-islet, and acinar cell
phenotypes with cellular function in AAb+ and T1D pancreata. We anticipate these same defects will arise in
slices subjected to diabetogenic stimuli, providing a platform to test known and novel candidates for targeted
intervention to reduce β-cell stress, restore islet and acinar cell function, as well as prevent disease progression."
10901870,"SUMMARY ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND. Since 1990, the global annual rate of change in exposure to intimate partner violence has
stagnated at 0·07%, and that for child sexual abuse and peer victimization has risen to 0·65%. Peer victimization
remains a top-10 contributor to disability in adolescents and young adults (10-24 y), and global attributable
deaths and disability from these exposures predominate in women and girls. These estimates suffer from limited
data on these and other forms of gender-based violence (GBV) and violence against children (VAC) and over-
aggregation to binary gender groups. The 2015 Sustainable Development Goals to eliminate all forms of GBV
against women and girls and all VAC require capacity to study and address such violence in low- and middle-
income countries, with attention to local gender variance. AIMS & APPROACH. Emory University (USA), Hanoi
Medical University (Vietnam), and Atlanta/Vietnam partners propose the Consortium for Violence Research,
Implementation, and Leadership Training for Excellence (CONVERGE) to strengthen research and action on
GBV and VAC in Vietnam. CONVERGE addresses three synergistic programmatic aims: 1) To develop a diverse
pipeline of mentors for research on GBV and VAC in Vietnam by implementing an annual mentorship program
that prepares productive researchers to be strong scientific mentors (15 long-term; 40 short-term); 2a) To
strengthen capacity for relevant GBV and VAC research in Vietnam by providing long-term post-doctoral
research training and career development to a diverse group of researchers with exceptional potential (15 long-
term); 2b) To support fast-tracking of evidence into practice with implementation science and leadership/science
dissemination short-courses that connect scholars and practitioners (15 long-term; 45 short-term; 60
practitioners); and 3) To implement a training evaluation plan that assesses the implementation reach, fidelity,
and effectiveness of our four training components and applies findings iteratively for greater success.
INNOVATION & IMPACT. Over 10 years of research partnerships among CONVERGE members confirm the
feasibility of achieving our aims. Our mentor training will create a pipeline of researchers who are skilled mentors
for future trainees. Our long-term post-doctoral research training adapts successful integrated, inter-disciplinary
training programs to develop a cadre of researchers skilled in GBV and VAC research. Our implementation-
science and leadership/science-dissemination training will nurture a researcher-practitioner network that fast-
tracks evidence into practice. Our training plan supports research priorities of Vietnam and the NIH on women’s
health, child health and human development, mental health, minority health and health disparities, alcohol abuse
and alcoholism, drug abuse, and general medicine. CONVERGE will train a critical mass of 115 mentors, post-
doctoral scholars, and practitioners in Vietnam in GBV and VAC research, implementation science, and
leadership/science dissemination. We will promote, using tested strategies, trainee retention and institutional
capacity to lead relevant GBV and VAC research, training, and best practice for Vietnam and the region."

Muscular dystrophies are genetically and clinically heterogeneous disorders characterized by progressive
weakness and degeneration of the skeletal muscles that control movement. The most common, Duchenne
Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), is caused by genetic and biochemical defects of the dystrophin-glycoprotein
complex (DGC). These alterations lead to cell membrane damage and death of muscle cells, resulting in chronic
tissue degeneration and impaired muscle contractility. Although no effective treatment is available at present,
one attractive therapeutic approach is to use cell-based therapies to promote muscle regeneration. There has
been tremendous excitement for the therapeutic potential of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells in treating
genetic diseases since these cells have virtually unlimited proliferation potential, and can differentiate into all cell
types. We have pioneered a method to generate engraftable skeletal myogenic progenitors from pluripotent stem
cells through conditional expression of Pax3 or Pax7. This approach results in highly efficient generation of
therapeutic myogenic progenitors, which when transplanted into dystrophic mice locally or systemically produce
large quantities of functional skeletal muscle tissue that incorporates normally into the host muscle. Importantly,
a fraction of transplanted cells remains mononuclear, and displays key features of skeletal muscle stem cells,
including satellite cell localization, response to re-injury, and contribution to muscle regeneration in secondary
transplantation assays. Based on these encouraging findings, we have begun the manufacturing of these cells
under cGMP compatible conditions and performed preclinical studies in murine recipients. The results from these
studies are promising but before moving this therapy towards clinical translation, it would be ideal to assess
scalability, delivery, distribution, safety, and engraftment in larger animal models. Therefore, here we propose
preclinical studies to investigate these parameters using non-human primates (NHP) as recipients. It will also be
critical to understand the impact of HLA mismatch on muscle engraftment, and NHP represent the ideal system
to properly address this question. The transplantation of NHP iPS cell-derived myogenic progenitors into NHP
recipients will provide critical knowledge for understanding tolerance in the allogeneic setting. This aspect, which
has important implications for regenerative medicine, has been mostly overlooked in the pluripotent stem cell
field. These are all critical prerequisites to advance this therapy towards successful clinical translation."
10900818,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Trauma is a leading cause of death and disability in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), particularly in Cameroon, where
a higher burden of injury is reported compared to similar settings in the region. Injury research focused on
prevention and improvements in trauma care, such as trauma Quality improvement (QI), have led to significant
reductions in the burden of injury in high-income countries. Yet, there remain critical gaps in the current trauma
research infrastructure in SSA due to limited training opportunities. The Sustainable Trauma Research,
Education, and Mentorship Program (STREaM) will seek to fill this gap, building on an existing long-term
partnership between the University of California and the University of Buea (Buea) to provide innovative training
to Cameroonian post-graduate candidates with a focus on novel, cutting edge quantitative tools. STREaM
Cameroon program will aspire to establish a cadre of graduate trainees with multidisciplinary expertise in Injury
prevention and control, quality improvement, and quantitative methods that can address limitations posed by the
time-dependent, dynamic, and incomplete nature of trauma-related data. The program will leverage recent
advances in research methodologies, such as machine learning and implementation science, that are particularly
suited to trauma research. STREaM Cameroon aims to accomplish the following objectives:1) Train a
critical mass of multidisciplinary scientists in trauma research through MPH, PhD, and post-doctoral pathways
who will form the foundation for an Injury Center at the Buea; 2) Develop and implement a combination of short,
medium, and long-term quantitative and trauma research curricula co-taught by U.S. and Cameroonian faculty
to sustainably strengthen existing offerings at the Buea; 3) Provide mentored research opportunities for trainees
to apply quantitative skills to trauma QI projects utilizing the partnership’s existing research and data collection
infrastructure in Cameroon; and 4) Integrate trainee scholars into a robust scientific network through existing
international organizations and the creation of a Cameroonian Trauma Network to serve as an ongoing
community of practice. During the five-year program, a total of 2 post docs, and eight PhD and Master’s level
students per year will be trained using a team mentoring approach. Master’s and PhD students will take part in
online courses throughout their training, administered through the University of California Berkeley and University
of California San Francisco’s Clinical and Translational Science Institute. All students will participate in mentored
research. Additionally, post-docs will spend one semester at Berkeley receiving in-person training to prepare
them for faculty positions at Buea. Upon completion of the STReaM program, graduates will successfully engage
in innovative, evidence-based research to improve the quality of trauma care and reduce the burden of injury
among vulnerable populations in SSA. STReaM Cameroon graduates will thus be trained and equipped to
mentor the next generation of scientists in trauma research, playing a critical role in influencing healthcare
practices and policy locally and internationally."
10909021,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The central mission of the T32 “Molecular Imaging in Cancer Biology” program (T32 MICB) will be to develop
novel molecular imaging methods, technologies, and platforms that will accelerate the understanding of human
cancer biology as a basis for designing curative cancer therapeutic regimens as well as cutting-edge
diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic tools. This overall goal will be achieved under the auspices of three key
themes: (1) “Imaging Fundamental Biology,” (2) “Imaging New Model Systems,” and (3) “Imaging Technology
Development.” This T32 MICB research portfolio is situated at the intersection of various disciplines—from
basic science including chemistry and physics, structural biology, drug development, cell biology, and
developmental biology to cancer biology, invasion and metastasis, and applied disciplines, including
pharmacology, nanotechnology, radiochemistry, engineering, and medicine. Fundamental knowledge about
the biology of cancer has burgeoned, but the translation of basic science discoveries to clinical advancements
can be slow and inefficient; molecular imaging can significantly accelerate this process and a well-trained
population of basic scientists well-versed in all aspects of molecular imaging is crucial to the success of this
endeavor. The faculty preceptors chosen for this T32 MICB reflect the broad range of expertise and are
leaders in their respective imaging fields. They are well-funded and have independent R01 (cancer-related) or
R01-like research support (e.g., R35 or HHMI). To ensure that the trainees (five post-doctoral slots and one
pre-doctoral slot per year) have a full well-rounded training experience (including resilience and well-being) in
preparation for independent careers, our initial design is based on a three-year training program for
both the postdoctoral fellows and the predoctoral graduate student trainees. Prior to entry into the T32 MICB
program and during the program, the trainees will be informed about the mission of the T32 MICB
program, which is to produce scientists with specialized knowledge in advances in cancer biology
and imaging technology, within a culture of respect and engagement. Furthermore, trainees will be informed
about expected achievements during the program and that their progress will be continuously evaluated and
benchmarked."

Over 100,000 women in the United States undergo mastectomy procedures each year due to breast cancer, resulting in loss of breast tissue. One of the key traits of a patient's breast tissue that is often neglected in reconstruction is the nipple areolar complex (NAC). There is no clinically viable solution for NAC reconstruction or regeneration. The long-term goal of this work is to develop a personalized, bioresorbable NAC that will provide patients with the shape of a native nipple projection. To pursue this goal, we have developed a hybrid biomaterial implant system consisting of two complementary polymers that (1) define the architecture of the NAC and (2) encourages tissue ingrowth into the NAC. The NAC implant will eventually degrade, leaving in its place a reconstructed NAC that is similar to the original tissue in size, shape, and texture. To this end, we suggest three specific aims. Specific Aim 1 will bioprint a viable and translatable NAC. We will generate a portfolio of NAC implant designs via Solidworks, allowing for rapid development of personalized implants. CAD designs will explore the impact of nipple projection height, nipple diameter, areola diameter, and NAC infill patterning upon the implant's properties, and particularly on the retention of shape over time. NAC implants will be fabricated from rapidly translatable biomaterials. Physical and biological properties {shape, mechanics, cell seeding efficiency, cell viability/ proliferation, matrix production) will be assessed, and individual implant component properties and degradation will be evaluated. Specific Aim 2 will establish an in vitro culture system for a bioprinted NAC. We have developed a 3D printed bioreactor specifically for the culture of a bioprinted NAC, as the construct presents unique culture challenges due to its tissue biology (air-water interface) and tissue architecture (non-planar projection shape). NAC bioreactors will be fabricated and employed to culture the bioprinted constructs. Culture conditions, including media flow rate, will be optimized to support cell proliferation and function (ECM production), while maintaining shape of the NAC system. Finally, Aim 3 will vascularize a bioprinted NAC. We suggest that the successful strategy for a clinically translatable bioprinted implant will utilize vascular ingrowth from the surrounding host tissue and into the NAC. To this end, we will design and fabricate a hierarchical NAC vasculature network consisting of a printed microvasculature and a self-assembled microvasculature directed by host tissue. Furthering our established animal model, we will optimize the NAC's vasculature features (architecture, cellularity) to deliver the critical outcomes of rapid establishment, sufficient nutrient delivery, and vascular functionality- while maintaining the NAC's structure and function. The result of the proposed work will be the ability to produce a personalized nipple areolar complex that can be implanted during mound reconstruction or at a later date."

Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with [177Lu]DOTATATE improves quality of life and survival in
patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors; however objective tumor regression is infrequent and complete
responses are exceedingly rare. On the other hand, exciting-emerging evidence suggests that PRRT with
alpha-emitters has the potential to extend PRRT to tumor regression and even complete response. In this
study we propose to develop a new theranostic pair using [203Pb]PSC-TOC (imaging) / [212Pb]PSC-TOC (alpha
emitter) for image-guided dosimetry based personalized therapy for neuroendocrine tumors. In Specific Aim 1
of the proposal, we will optimize the radiolabeling and production of [203/212Pb]PSC-TOC to prepare for its use
in clinical trials and perform a preclinical dose escalation trial in immune-competent mice to investigate drug
toxicity and the relation of toxicity with radiation dose (using residence time as a surrogate) to the organs. The
accurate measurement of radiation dose from alpha-emitters is challenging due to dependence of the dose on
the distribution of the radiopharmaceutical at cellular and subcellular level. In Specific Aim 2, we propose to
develop a surrogate for organ dosimetry based on the residence time of the radiopharmaceutical in a human
imaging trial with [203Pb]PSC-TOC, This methodology requires serial imaging over multiple days. We will then
extend the dosimetry methodology to develop a predictive model to identify the best single imaging time point
that predicts kidney accumulation, similar to our previous work with 90Y-DOTATOC, for translation of the
dosimetry procedure into the clinical practice. Finally in Specific Aim 3 we will conduct a Phase 1 dose
escalation trial of personalized dosimetry-guided therapy with [212Pb]PSC-TOC in patients with advanced stage
NETs who have progressed or are refractory to conventional PRRT with beta emitters. The dose escalation
paradigm will be based on escalating critical organ dose limits (using residence time as surrogate for
dosimetry). The primary objective of the Phase 1 clinical trial will be the identification of the maximum safe
kidney dose surrogate from treatment with [212Pb]PSC-TOC that should be used for a subsequent Phase 2
efficacy trial with the agent. As a secondary objective we will assess objective tumor response to PRRT with
[212Pb]PSC-TOC.

10880434,"We use the basic science of behavior change1,2 experimental medicine approach to efficiently test the effects
of four distinct behavior change techniques (BCTs). These BCTs are selected to engage one of the key
behavioral mechanisms of action (MoAs)--self-efficacy--for improving daily walking by at least 1000 steps in
those who are very sedentary and at elevated cardiovascular disease risk.3,4 We propose a randomized 25
factorial experiment to do so. Whereas we have hundreds of behavior change interventions aimed at physical
activity initiation, most test multi-BCT interventions, averaging six BCTs in each randomized controlled trial.6
Systematic reviews of these trials concluded that self-efficacy was in many cases the key proposed
mechanism of action that improved initiation.7-11 They also concluded that self-efficacy was significantly
improved by these multi-BCT interventions, as was physical activity.7,12 However, when they attempt to
conclude that one BCT uniquely engaged or changed self-efficacy, and that the change in self-efficacy in turn
increased the physical activity, they cannot do so.13 They cannot, because currently published physical activity
interventions--with one single exception--always have multiple BCTs involved. These interventions don't
quantitatively assess whether the BCT was used by the participant. These interventions don't assess the key
MoA and behavior repeatedly across time, so that a full mediation model can be appropriately tested and
analyzed. And, they don't estimate statistical power for conducting such a mediation model test, and so are
likely under-powered to detect mediation.
The Science of Behavior Change experimental method proposes that researchers identify the putative MoA,
engage this MoA through experimentation and/or intervention, and then assess the degree to which MoA
engagement produces behavior change. We used this approach to design an experiment in which eligible
sedentary adults will be randomized to one of 16 cells for five months of intervention. Innovations of this project
include: 1) identifying the individual effects of each of four BCTs on the hypothesized MoA, with a full factorial
design; 2) using sequential mediation analysis to address longitudinal mediators; 3) including sufficient
participants (N=480) to have adequate statistical power; and 4) quantitatively assessing whether the BCT was
used.
Sedentary behavior among participants at risk for CVD is highly prevalent, and is associated with increased
risk for morbidity and mortality. Identifying which unique behavior change techniques engage self-efficacy and
improve walking, and which ones don't, may allow future interventions to be more efficient and scientifically
informed to precisely target this important public health problem."

Among those with hypertension, persons living with HIV (PWH) have a 50% higher risk of incident myocardial
infarction compared to the general population, and they often fail to meet evidence-based treatment goals for
hypertension. An important contributing factor for insufficient blood pressure control is nonadherence to
antihypertensive medications. Research on medication adherence for PWH has largely focused on
antiretroviral therapy adherence with limited focus on adherence to other non-AIDS condition medications.
Major determinants of adherence to antihypertensive medications are driven by a confluence of factors that
operate at the patient, provider, and healthcare system levels. However, there is a lack of data on how to
harness these levels of influence to impact initiation, implementation, and management of adherence to
antihypertensive medications for PWH and hypertension. The question, then, is how can we adapt evidence-
based interventions to target specific barriers at different levels of influence to reduce antihypertensive
medication nonadherence for PWH in order to improve blood pressure control?
 Dr. Charles Muiruri is a medical instructor in the Department of Population Health Sciences (DPHS)
and Global Health Institute at Duke University. Dr. Muiruri received a diversity supplemental award and now
seeks a K01 award to gain skills, experience, and preliminary data needed for an independently funded, health
services–focused research program that specializes in designing and implementing evidence-based
interventions that are grounded in theory to prevent non-AIDS conditions such as cardiovascular disease
among PWH.
 Through the training and research experience outlined in this award, Dr. Muiruri will utilize his
background in applied econometrics in health services research and mixed methods to capture patient- and
provider-level barriers that an intervention must address to reduce antihypertensive medication nonadherence
(Aims 1 and 2) for PWH who have achieved viral suppression. The proposed work is guided by an
implementation science framework to design and implement a clinic-based intervention to reduce
antihypertensive medication nonadherence for PWH who have poor blood pressure control (Aim 3). The career
development plan includes training in implementation science theory, stated-preference research, medical
decision making, and medication adherence-related sciences through mentorship, coursework, and
participation in working groups, professional development programs, and scientific meetings.
 This study will lay the groundwork for a fully powered investigator initiated R01 trial on the
implementation of the intervention. Insights from this work may also be applicable to medication adherence for
a range of other non-AIDS conditions among PWH, such as dyslipidemia."

We seek to understand how the physiochemical environment of the extracellular matrix affects the diffusion,
structure, and folding of proteins. The extracellular matrix is spatially heterogeneous at nanoscales and can
change over time. But current imaging methods are limited in spatial and temporal resolutions, while biochemical
techniques are designed for model, pristine solutions that differ from the complexity of the extracellular matrix.
Therefore, how proteins function locally in the extracellular matrix is an underexplored area in biophysics. We
propose to understand how proteins function and interact in the complex extracellular matrix environment, and
how the nanoscale variation in the chemical and physical composition of this environment can locally change
protein dynamics. To achieve this, we will use a correlation-based super-resolution microscopy developed by
our lab that can access the time- and spatial-scales of protein dynamics within the extracellular matrix. The goals
of this proposal are to: 1) identify how the nanoscale chemical and steric properties of the extracellular matrix
control protein diffusion, structure, and folding; 2) determine how cells tune the dynamics of proteins by
changing the extracellular matrix; 3) develop instrumental and analysis methods that access the spatiotemporal
regimes required to understand protein function in the extracellular environment. Achieving our goals will reveal
the extracellular matrix and protein dynamics that drive biological regulation and will provide researchers with
methods to understand and potentially control extracellular delivery of signaling proteins or therapeutics. Overall,
an entirely new area of biology – the extracellular matrix - will be explored by super-resolution microscopy; the
findings can be broadly applied to other biomolecules, cells, and tissues of relevance to fundamental biophysics,
drug-delivery/therapeutics, and disease."

The Tennessen Lab uses the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, as a model to understand how carbohydrate
metabolism supports the biosynthetic and energetic demands of animal growth and development. Our ongoing
studies focus on a metabolic program known as the Warburg effect (aerobic glycolysis). This metabolic program
allows growing and proliferating cells to metabolize large quantities of glucose in order to generate biomass and
synthesize pro-growth signaling molecules. While aerobic glycolysis is most commonly associated with tumors,
where it promotes the growth and survival of cancer cells, healthy animal cells, such as stem cells and activated
T cells, also use this metabolic program to drive biosynthesis and regulate cell fate decisions. Therefore, basic
studies of aerobic glycolysis have the potential to not only identify metabolic mechanisms that could be targeted
to inhibit tumor growth but also to reveal how healthy cells manipulate glycolytic metabolism as a means of
supporting normal developmental growth. I have discovered that the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster also uses
aerobic glycolysis to promote growth and have established the fly as a model system for studying the genetic
mechanisms that regulate this metabolic program. My initial efforts using this model have proven successful, as
I have determined that the Drosophila Estrogen-Related Receptor (dERR) is a master regulator of aerobic
glycolysis. My lab will now expand upon these initial observations to identify the molecular mechanisms that both
activate and repress aerobic glycolysis in vivo. Furthermore, we have determined that Drosophila larvae use
aerobic glycolysis to synthesize the oncometabolite L-2-hydroxyglutarate (L-2HG). This compound is almost
exclusively studied in the context of cancer metabolism and endogenous L-2HG function remains largely
unexplored. We will determine how L-2HG synthesis is controlled in vivo and explore how this oncometabolite
controls normal animal growth. Finally, we will use a combination of genetics, genomics, and metabolomics to
determine how the disruption of key reactions in aerobic glycolysis affects growth and physiology. Many of these
enzymes represent potential therapuetic targets and our innovative approach provides a rare opportunity to
systematically evaluate the effects of inhibiting individual glycolytic enzymes in a whole animal system.
Moreover, our studies also explore the compensatory metabolic pathways that are activated in response to
decreased glycolytic flux, which in a clinical setting, could render tumors insenstive to drug treatments. Finally,
we have uncovered an unexpected correlation between the repression of aerobic glycolysis, increased levels of
fatty acid oxidation, and pyrimidine metabolism. My lab will use this unexpected discovery as a foundation to
explore the poorly understood role of fatty acid beta-oxidation in nucleotide production. Our studies will allow, for
the first time, a genetic dissection of the mechanisms regulating aerobic glycolysis within the context of normal
animal development and will potentially uncover novel approaches to control cellular growth at a metabolic level."
10843853,"Injury-related fear after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury significantly contributes to decreased
return to sport, decreased physical activity engagement, and increased ACL reinjury risk in previously high
functioning, physically active individuals. Injury-related fear is also associated with poor jump-landing
movement patterns in patients after ACL reconstruction (ACLR). Unfortunately, current rehabilitation practices
do not specifically address injury-related fear in patients after ACLR. Virtual reality mindfulness meditation is a
mental practice that involves focusing your mind on your experiences in the present moment and has been
used to address depression, anxiety, and chronic musculoskeletal pain. Additionally, mindfulness meditation
has led to positive changes in brain activity in individuals with depression, anxiety, and chronic musculoskeletal
pain. Patients after ACLR exhibit poor brain activity similar to individuals with depression, anxiety, and chronic
musculoskeletal pain; thus, patients after ACLR may also benefit from mindfulness meditation. To evaluate the
effect of virtual reality mindfulness meditation on patients after ACLR, we will determine the effect of virtual
reality mindfulness meditation to 1) decrease self-reported injury-related fear, 2) improve poor jump-landing
movement patterns, and 3) improve brain activity in women 9-months post-ACLR when compared to a virtual
reality sham group. Injury-related fear and poor jump-landing movement patterns have been associated with
ACL reinjury risk. Women were selected for this study as previous literature has demonstrated sex differences
in brain activity and women also have a higher incidence of ACL injury and ACL reinjury risk. All patients in the
study will complete an 8-week advanced rehabilitation training program to improve lower-body muscle
strength, power, and flexibility. Patients in the intervention group will complete 8-weeks of virtual reality
mindfulness meditation + the advanced rehabilitation training program. Patients in the sham group will
complete 8-weeks of the virtual reality sham + the advanced rehabilitation training program. The central
hypothesis is that women 9-months post ACLR who undergo virtual reality mindfulness meditation will
demonstrate decreased injury-related fear, improved jump-landing movement patterns, and improved brain
activity. The findings from this proposal will address a gap in knowledge about effective psychological
interventions to address psychological and biological factors associated with ACL reinjury risk. This proposal
also positions an aspiring independent clinician scientist training to learn neuroimaging techniques and
complex movement pattern data collection and analyses. With this training, the primary investigator will
examine the efficacy of virtual reality mindfulness meditation to mitigate injury-related fear, decrease ACL
reinjury risk, and improve quality of life in patients after ACLR throughout her career as a clinician scientist."

 The discovery of mutations in EGFR that drive lung cancer growth and confer sensitivity to tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKIs) has transformed the treatment of lung cancer. However, responses to TKIs are variable and
resistance ultimately develops. Thus, EGFR-driven lung cancers still cause ~20,000 deaths annually in the US.
These tumors have frequent alterations in diverse tumor suppressor genes (TSGs), however which of these
alterations co-operate to drive tumor growth, how they impact cancer cell state, and whether they are key
determinants of responses to therapy remains largely unknown. Current methods to uncover relationships
between EGFR and TSGs largely rely on correlative human genomic studies and cell line-based models.
However, genomic studies are often statistically underpowered to uncover genetic interactions and do not
provide information on TSG function. Conversely, cell line studies do not recapitulate the in vivo environment
and the limited cell lines that exist represent only a subset of EGFR mutant tumors. To overcome these limitations
and better understand the genomic drivers of lung cancer growth and drug responses in vivo, we recently
integrated a novel autochthonous mouse model of oncogenic EGFR-driven lung cancer with CRISPR/Cas9-
mediated somatic genome editing and high-throughput tumor barcode sequencing. Using this multiplexed in vivo
model, we uncovered the splicing factor RBM10 as a poorly characterized suppressor of tumor growth and
unexpectedly found that inactivation of the “tumor suppressor” Lkb1 is synthetic lethal with oncogenic EGFR.
Here, we will investigate how genotype controls the biology of oncogenic EGFR-driven lung cancer. Specifically,
we will establish the cellular and molecular consequences of Rbm10 inactivation and elucidate the mechanism
that underlies the synthetic lethality between EGFR and Lkb1. Moreover, understanding how tumor genotype
influences treatment responses could reveal genotype-specific therapeutic vulnerabilities. Thus, we will leverage
our multiplexed in vivo gene editing platform to determine the impact of additional TSGs on EGFR mutant lung
cancer growth and uncover genomic drivers of responses to therapy. This work will increase our fundamental
understanding of the genomic determinants of EGFR mutant lung cancer growth and reveal novel and
therapeutically targetable pro-tumorigenic pathways. These findings could ultimately inform precision treatments
for patients with oncogenic EGFR-driven lung cancer."
10899568,"Abstract
Novel vaccines are needed that have higher efficacy and that provide long-lasting protection against emerging
influenza viruses. An attractive approach towards developing a “universal” vaccine is focused on eliciting
antibodies that target conserved regions of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein on the surface of the virus. The
receptor binding site and the stem are two such HA regions, and the elicitation of humoral responses focused
on these sites has been the subject of multiple studies. Recently, a new class of antibodies has been
discovered that targets the highly conserved HA head trimer interface. Antibodies against this epitope were
found in multiple individuals, have broad heterosubtypic cross-reactivity and provided protection against viral
challenges in animal models. Therefore, induction of these type of antibodies as part of a universal influenza
vaccine would be valuable. The head trimer interface epitope is occluded in crystal structures of HAs, and
likely becomes exposed just transiently through molecular “breathing”. This limited accessibility may explain at
least in part why natural humoral responses against this site are rare. In this proposal, we will engineer
immunogens that present unobstructed the HA head trimer interface epitope in molecular contexts devoid of
other immunodominant sites. Using computational protein modeling and high throughput library screening, HA
derived as well as non-influenza based immunogens will be developed that: 1) expose the HA head trimer
interface to facilitate immune recognition; 2) preferentially interact with broadly cross-reactive, but not with
strain specific, antibodies that target this site and 3) occlude immunodominant regions to focus the immune
responses on the epitope. Designed immunogens will be used to vaccinate small animals to assess their ability
to protect against live virus. Detailed analysis of the B cell receptor repertoires of vaccinated animals will reveal
the developmental pathways that lead to the activation and maturation of humoral responses against the
conserved HA head trimer interface. This proposal will provide candidate immunogen towards the development
of a universal influenza vaccine, lead to a better understanding of molecular features that control HA
conformation and immunogenicity, and establish general approaches for immunogen design."

Project Summary
Structure and composition across physiological length-scales are key intermediate traits that link gene
expression with functional outcomes. Genetic and/or environmental perturbations affecting gene expression
often lead to measureable changes in these intermediate traits that have mechanical and other functional
consequences. Accurately quantifying structure and composition at different length scales is therefore essential
to advancing our understanding of the molecular and mechanical mechanisms underlying musculoskeletal health
and disease; to develop and evaluate treatment strategies; and to ultimately translate these strategies to the
clinic. However, this research requires use of advanced and costly instruments and supporting expertise in cell
biology, chemistry, engineering, and biomedical imaging. The Structure, Composition and Histology Core
(Core B) will provide access to the instruments and expertise that will enable Center investigators to quantify
these intermediate traits and to accelerate their research programs. Core B will include ex-vivo micro-Computed
Tomography (µCT) and nano-Computed Tomography (nano-CT), Raman spectroscopy, and histology as its
major components. These technologies were chosen for their applicability to all musculoskeletal tissues and
based on usage data over the previous 4 years and a needs-assessment survey of core users. Investigators at
the University of Michigan pioneered the use of µCT and Raman spectroscopy to investigate musculoskeletal
tissues and are leaders in applying these technologies to solve musculoskeletal problems. Histology continues
to be the gateway approach to understanding changes in tissue morphology and, when combined with CT and
Raman spectroscopy, histology can link tissue morphology to composition and functional outcomes. The goals
of this Core are to leverage the expertise of the core leadership to support the research programs of Center
investigators in performing structural, compositional and histological analyses of all musculoskeletal tissues, both
intellectually and financially; to expand opportunities for our research community; and to bring new investigators
into the musculoskeletal community. To accomplish our goals and to continue creating a robust and sustainable
impact to the musculoskeletal community in the P30 renewal application, we propose the following Specific Aims:
Aim 1: To provide expertise and guidance on the best use of technologies and experimental design to allow
investigators to conduct specialized assays for quantifying structure and composition across length scales.
Aim 2: To provide expert use, standardization, and training in state-of-the-art technologies to quantify structure
and composition across physiological length scales.
Aim 3: To provide expertise and scientific guidance on data analysis, interpretation of results and
recommendations for future studies.
Aim 4: To expand opportunities for our research community through innovation and development of enabling

goals will specifically be achieved by 1) providing samples from our vast collection of archived normal and
diseased human skin; 2) facilitating access to de-identified fresh human skin samples; 3) advanced multiplexed
immunohistochemical imaging of marker proteins; 4) aiding in the generation of state-of-the-art genetic mouse
models for skin functional studies; 5) providing training in refined isolation technologies for specific skin cell
populations; 5) providing training for advanced live imaging in vitro and in vivo; 6) generating patient iPSCs and

Project Summary
Discovery of new targets and treatments for musculoskeletal diseases requires a deep understanding of the
basic biology of musculoskeletal development and function, rigorous research into the fundamental mechanisms
of disease pathogenesis, and robust testing of therapeutic targets and therapies aimed at improving disease
outcome. Research using animal models is a cornerstone of these efforts enabling the study of organ and
integrative organism function, the impact of environment, age, sex, and genetics on disease, and testing
therapies and outcomes with disease-relevant measures. The ability to study musculoskeletal phenotypes
across a wide-ranging scale of animal models requires considerable expertise and highly specialized training in
physiology, biophysics, and engineering, as well as access to costly, high-resolution, state-of-the-art equipment.
While occasionally the expertise and equipment for single approaches can be developed in a single laboratory,
developing these approaches can be cost prohibitive, redundant, and can lead to proliferation of non-uniform
techniques across the field. Rigorous and reproducible basic and preclinical research also requires robust
experimental planning that can span multi-modal testing platforms from cellular and organ level function to in
vivo physiology testing, in order to provide a fully comprehensive measure of phenotype or disease pathology.
In cross-disciplinary research, innovation often arises from collaborations that extend beyond the limits of
expertise in individual investigator laboratories alone. The overall long-term goal of the Function Core (Core C)
of the Michigan Integrative Musculoskeletal Health Center (MiMHC) is to provide state-of-the-art animal and
organ level phenotyping resources at the University of Michigan that can be used by the entire musculoskeletal
research community, regardless of individual expertise. The Core brings together the leadership and technical
experts in the physiology and biomechanics of the musculoskeletal system to provide fully staffed, specialized
laboratory approaches to musculoskeletal biology including whole animal in vivo phenotyping and surgical
models of musculoskeletal disease, and state-of-the-art measurements in bone mechanics, muscle function and
mechanics, tendon mechanics, and neuromuscular function. Further emphasis on training and sharing of new
technologies, standardization, and collaboration will expand the impact of Core C for our users and the broader
musculoskeletal research community."

Diagnosis and management of musculoskeletal disorders is complex and best done with multidisciplinary teams
and by analyzing data from a variety of complex sources. Advances in high-throughput ‘-omics’ technologies
combined with large volumes of imaging and clinical data have created an unprecedented opportunity to better
understand musculoskeletal disorders, improve patient outcomes, and reveal hidden information from clinical
and pre-clinical data by applying integrative computational techniques. However, designing integrative models
and computational approaches is challenging and requires expertise in omics, imaging and data analysis. The

multidisciplinary team of experts in omics, imaging and machine learning methodologies. Core D will provide
expertise and scientific guidance in data analysis and help investigators plan well-powered randomized block
study designs, interpret results, and provide recommendations for future studies. Core leadership will advise
Center investigators on the best tools and methods for analyzing data and provide expertise in developing robust

analysis of the skin in normal homeostasis and in disease. Core C will provide state-of-the-art start-to-finish
technologies for these cutting-edge approaches. The Core will leverage existing campus resources, such as
instrumentation and extensive expertise at both faculty and researcher levels, to provide technical and
intellectual support to the SBDRC Research Community. Core personnel will be embedded in skin research
labs where they will become familiarized with skin as a biological system and the questions being asked; this
will help to ensure that they can most effectively advise lab personnel on experimental design and services to
address the biological questions; conversely lab personnel will become more familiar with the technological
approaches available to them. Specifically, Core C will provide SBDRC investigators with consultation and

utilized for specimen and project in-take, both internally and externally. As part of Aim 1, Core C will facilitate
access to genomics (exome sequencing, whole genome sequencing and targeted capture) and transcriptomic
technologies (bulk RNA-seq, poly(A) RNA-seq, small RNA-seq) in healthy and diseased skin. Access to long-
read single molecule sequencing (SMRT/PacBio) will facilitate the analysis of structural changes in DNA and
the precise identification of RNA isoforms due to altered splicing. Services in Aim 2 will focus on state-of-the
art epigenomic studies to identify regulatory elements operating in the skin (ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, CUT&RUN).
Interactions across regulatory elements (enhancers and promoters) will be identified by Hi-C. Integration with
transcriptomic findings will confirm target genes and identify altered networks operating in skin homeostasis
and disease. Aim 3 will focus on cellular heterogeneity, providing single cell technologies for transcript
(scRNA-seq) and epigenetic (scATAC-seq) analyses in single cells. CITE-Seq will provide simultaneous
epitope and transcriptome measurements of single cells. Services from Aim 3 will also include spatial
transcriptomics technology permitting the spatial resolution of RNA-seq data, and thereby the locations of all
mRNAs in individual tissue sections. As novel “omics” technologies are developed that would enhance skin
biology research, they will be incorporated into this Core’s activities. Data will be distributed to Core D where

10846573,"Project Summary/Abstract:
 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology is defined by aberrant protein aggregation of extracellular amyloid-
beta plaques and intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau tangles within the brain, resulting in progressive cognitive
decline. However, a plethora of amyloid-beta targeting therapies have yielded limited clinical benefit, lending
credence to the significance of tau aggregation in AD. Specifically, the protein degradation network, which
includes the autophagy-lysosomal system (autophagy) and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), is frequently
cited as deficient in AD, and may therefore affect neurodegeneration and intracellular tau protein clearance within
the brain. To investigate the mechanisms of selective protein degradation in neuronal proteostasis and AD I will
use an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neuronal system (iNs). Specifically, our lab has generated
over 50 human iN lines from the Religious Order Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) cohorts
which represent the full clinical and neuropathological spectrum of late onset AD. Across these genetically
diverse iNs, we previously assayed basal autophagic flux and UPS capacity. Additionally, proteomic analysis
and western blotting of these same iNs revealed strong associations between phosphorylated tau species and
proteins relevant in selective autophagy of protein aggregates (aggrephagy). Of particular interest is the
ubiquitin-dependent aggrephagy adaptor protein, optineurin (OPTN), which displays the most significant
negative correlation with aggregated phospho-tau forms relevant in our AD neurons. BCL-2-associated
athanogene 3 (BAG3) is another relevant aggrephagy chaperone protein that has previously been associated
with tau homeostasis within excitatory neurons and shows a strong compensatory relationship upon UPS
inhibition in our human neuronal system. Therefore, I hypothesize that AD derived neurons have a diminished
capacity for protein degradation activation following exposure to AD relevant neurotoxic proteins and genetic
modulation of autophagy, which results in an accumulation of phospho-tau and a reduction in neuronal activity.
To address this hypothesis, I have two aims: 1) To determine the influence of OPTN regulation on neuronal tau
proteostasis and neuronal function. To this end I will expose both AD and non-AD iNs to brain extract containing
neurotoxic proteins and measure several forms of tau and neuronal firing. 2) To investigate the role of BAG3-
mediated chaperone-assisted selective autophagy in modulating protein degradation compensation in human
neurons. Here, I will modulate BAG3 expression in both AD and non-AD iNs and expose these iNs to AD brain
extract containing neurotoxic proteins. I then will measure tau accumulation, neuronal firing, and protein turnover.
Taken together, the findings of this proposal will not only further the understanding of tau protein degradation via
aggrephagy but will define the molecular mechanisms governing OPTN and BAG3 regulation and function in
neurons and may lead to novel therapeutic modalities."
10891421,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cocaine Use Disorder (CUD) represents a significant public health and socioeconomic concern. Cocaine is
involved in 40% of drug-related emergency room visits, and rates of cocaine overdose in the United States are
climbing steadily. Yet, the genetic underpinnings that predispose to CUD remain poorly understood. Twin studies
on the genetics of CUD provide heritability estimates between 42-79%. However, significant heritability estimates
do not indicate which genes are involved, and how they might be functionally relevant. Genome-wide association
studies (GWAS) of CUD are limited by inability to control environmental factors; the haplotype structure of the
human genome limiting mapping precision; and small sample sizes due to difficulty recruiting participants
because of criminalization of cocaine use. Model organisms such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster offer
a cost-effective alternative where sample size, environment, and genetic background can be controlled. Cocaine
binds to the dopamine transporter of Drosophila as it does in humans, eliciting cocaine-induced locomotor
phenotypes. GWAS in Drosophila are facilitated by the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel
(DGRP), an expanding collection of wild-derived, inbred, fully sequenced lines that provide a living library of
natural variation. It is my goal to use the DGRP and a systems genetics approach to uncover the genetic
underpinnings of cocaine-related phenotypes. In Specific Aim 1, I will investigate the impact of genetic
background on cocaine preference by screening 600 DGRP lines for cocaine preference using the microplate
feeder assay. I will then perform a GWAS, utilizing whole genome sequence data to identify genetic variants
associated with cocaine preference. I will perform gene ontology and KEGG orthology pathway enrichment
analyses, as well as construct genetic interaction networks to implicate genes and pathways involved in cocaine
preference. In Specific Aim 2, I will quantify the behavioral and transcriptomic effects of cocaine exposure in
DGRP lines with extreme cocaine preference. For 25 DGRP lines that exhibit cocaine preference and 25 lines
near the population average, I will assess effects of cocaine on sensorimotor integration upon repeated
exposures. In Specific Aim 3, I will functionally validate candidate genes and variants associated with cocaine
preference using RNA interference and out-of-sample testing of DGRP lines, respectively. Completion of these
aims will result in a systems genetics model of cocaine preference in Drosophila with translational potential for
human cocaine use disorder. This project will train me in advanced systems genetics techniques and analyses
and prepare me for a professional career in the study of the genetics of substance use disorders."

The goal of this study is to test a multilevel approach to reduce adverse consequences of the COVID-19
pandemic with disparate impacts on Latinx and Black immigrants and refugees by observing and implementing
three nested levels of intervention: 1) an efficacious 6-month peer advocacy and mutual learning model
(Refugee and Immigrant Well-being Project, RIWP); 2) engagement with community-based organizations
(CBOs); and 3) structural policy changes expected to be enacted in response to the pandemic, such as a state
disaster relief proposal for mixed status Latinx families and expanded statewide health insurance coverage.
This community-based participatory research (CBPR) study builds on a long-standing collaboration with five
community-based organizations (CBOs) that focus on mental health, education, legal issues, and system
change efforts to improve the well-being of Latinx immigrants and African refugees. By including 240 Latinx
immigrants and 60 African refugees recruited from CBO partners who are randomly assigned to treatment-as-
usual CBO involvement or the RIWP intervention and a random sample comparison group of 300 Latinx
immigrants, this mixed methods longitudinal waitlist control group design study with seven time points over 36
months will test the effectiveness of the RIWP intervention and engagement with CBOs to reduce
psychological distress, daily stressors, and economic precarity and increase protective factors (social support,
critical awareness of/access to resources, English proficiency, cultural connectedness, and mental health
service use). This study will also test the ability of the RIWP intervention and engagement with CBOs to
increase access to the direct benefits of structural interventions (local/state relief-related policies) for Latinx
and Black immigrants and refugees. Mechanisms of intervention effectiveness will be explored by testing
mediating relationships between primary outcomes and protective factors. We will also track local/state policy
changes and obtain preliminary quantitative estimates of effects of these structural interventions on
psychological distress, stressors, and economic precarity using propensity score matching. Qualitative
interview data from a purposive subsample of participants and CBO staff will enable additional exploration of
mechanisms of change, the effects of policy interventions on individuals, how CBOs contribute to enacting
policies and helping people benefit from them, and the context of RIWP implementation at each site. This
research is innovative and significant because it employs cutting-edge research design and intervention
strategies to advance the science of multilevel mental health interventions that aim to understand and address
underlying structural inequities and resulting mental health disparities that have been highlighted and
exacerbated by the pandemic. Thus, this study will contribute not only to reducing the disparate adverse
mental health, behavioral, and socioeconomic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic but also to our ability
to eliminate mental health disparities among Latinx and Black populations."

commonly thought to affect only men, while female HA carriers are thought to be only rarely symptomatic.
There are an estimated four female HA carriers for every one HA male, and increasing evidence indicates that
decreased FVIII levels and bleeding symptoms in HA carriers are not rare. Many have significant bleeding
events despite Factor VIII activity levels considered adequate in males. Current understanding of bleeding
tendency in this area is lacking, and research investigating female HA carriers would greatly inform their
classification and management. The proposal seeks to develop a risk prediction model for bleeding tendency in
HA carriers, using parameters other than standard coagulation testing. In Aim 1, a multivariable risk prediction
model will be developed and validated. In Aim 2, a cell culture system to model the HA carrier state will be
developed and the role of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) in altering basal and stimulated levels of FVIII and
resulting thrombin generation will be evaluated. In Aim 3, the role that natural anticoagulants alter hemostasis
and explain differences in bleeding phenotypes between HA carriers independent of XCI will be investigated.
During the award period, Dr. Cygan will continue to develop his expertise in benign hematology, and further
expand his abilities in experimental design and implementation. A multidisciplinary mentorship team has been
assembled to ensure the success of this project and includes expertise in X chromosome biology, Factor VIII
expression, clinical hematology and biostatistics. The mentorship team includes Dr. Laura Carrel, Dr. Valder R.
Arruda and Dr. M. Elaine Eyster; they will guide Dr. Cygan in meeting his training objectives through direct
research experience, formal didactics, participation in institutional seminars and junior career development
opportunities. Dr. Lan Kong, a biostatistician, will contribute to Dr. Cygan’s research and career plan as a
collaborator and statistical advisor."

Cell migration is essential to many fundamental processes, including embryonic development, wound repair,
and cancer metastasis. Central to this process is the cellular cytoskeleton comprised of three polymeric
networks: F-actin, microtubules, and intermediate filaments (IFs). Vimentin is an IF protein that is essential to
the mechanical resilience of cells and regulates cross-talk amongst the cytoskeleton, but its role in how cells
squeeze through small pores in tissues is poorly understood. We have shown that loss of vimentin enhances
cell motility through three-dimensional 3D micro-fluidic channels and protects the nucleus from damage during
migration. Vimentin is thought to play a distinct role in the transfer of forces from cell surface matrix adhesions
to the nuclear surface, but new evidence suggests that vimentin may also play a more active role in persistent
cell motility via its interactions with actin stress fiber formation and microtubule positioning. Still, the specific
mechanisms by which vimentin enables 3D migration through dense tissue remains unclear. This project
addresses the overarching question: how does vimentin influence cytoskeletal functions, adhesions with
the extracellular matrix, and cell-cell interactions to coordinate 3D cell migration? To address this
question, we will pursue three sub-projects. First, we will determine the effects of vimentin in cytoskeletal-
mediated 3D cell motility. Second, we will identify vimentin’s role in integrin expression and focal adhesion
activation, and third, we will identify the mechanisms by which vimentin mediates collective cell migration
through extracellular matrix networks. These studies will be conducted in both 2D and 3D settings to define
how changes in the cellular environment impact the critical determinants of cytoskeletal polymers in cell
motility. We expected that these projects will determine new functional roles of vimentin in cell migration, which
has important implications for understanding healthy tissue maintenance and diseases that progress by the
migration of cells through tissues."
10886707,"During B cell lineage commitment, a dynamic shift of genes between transcriptionally restricted and
transcriptionally permissive compartments at the pre-pro-B to pro-B cell transition results in activation of
the B lineage program and repression of alternative lineage programs. While B lineage commitment is
generally believed to be driven by lineage-specific transcription factors, we have made the surprising
discovery that conditional knock-out of the ubiquitous transcription factor YY1 results in loss of B lineage
commitment, allowing subsequent development into the T cell lineage both in vitro and in vivo. Pioneer
transcription factors such as Ebf1 promote transcription of B lineages genes and repress expression of
alternative lineage genes to initiate B lineage commitment, but stable commitment requires changes in
chromatin structures at the pro-B cell stage. As YY1 is a key factor controlling lineage-specific gene
regulatory long-range chromatin interactions (LRCIs), we hypothesize that YY1 knock-out in pro-B cells
results in loss of chromatin LRCIs that stably maintain B lineage-specific gene expression. Consistent
with this, we found reduction of B lineage transcripts after YY1 knock-out. YY1 can also mediate
Polycomb Group (PcG) repression, and we found that YY1 knock-out resulted in increased expression
of alternative lineage genes, suggesting that YY1 loss abrogates repressive chromatin structures
needed to prevent expression of these genes. Thus, we hypothesize that YY1 knock-out in pro-B cells
results in lost chromatin structures that stably maintain lineage-specific gene expression, as well as loss
of repressive chromatin structures needed to prevent alternative lineage gene expression, thus leading
to lost B lineage commitment. To test this, we will determine chromatin folding patterns, nuclear
localization of key genes, chromatin accessibility, and epigenetic structures in wild-type and YY1-null
pro-B cells to define the genomic structures regulated by YY1 during B lineage commitment. To
determine if analogous effects of YY1 are operative in the T lineage, we will determine if YY1 loss
promotes lineage plasticity of YY1-null DN3 cells. YY1 is also necessary in pro-B cells for Igk locus
contraction required for rearrangement of distal Vk genes. It has been suggested that YY1 plays a
structural role in regulating chromatin structures, but it is unclear if this requires the YY1 transcriptional
activation, PcG, or self-association functions. We will utilize an established panel of YY1 mutants that
are compromised in these functions to assess in parallel, the mechanisms of YY1 regulation of
chromatin structures needed for B lineage commitment, and those needed for Igk locus contraction and
Jk-Vk rearrangement. As YY1 is involved in embryogenesis and development of multiple tissue types,
determining how YY1 controls genomic structures to specify B lineage commitment will provide a new
paradigm for the function of a ubiquitous factor in lineage-specific development."
10880672,"Cardiotoxicity related to cancer therapies is such a significant clinical problem that NCI and NHLBI have jointly
issued PA-19-112 to stimulate applications with the intent to mitigate cardiovascular dysfunction while optimizing
cancer outcomes. Cardiotoxicity, such as heart failure (HF), related to the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib has
been an increasingly recognized adverse event that contributes to the symptom burden and poor outcomes of
multiple myeloma (MM) patients. Given the knowledge gap in the understanding of carfilzomib-related
cardiotoxicity, a pharmacogenomic approach may identify pharmacogenomic/metabolomic biomarkers of such
adverse effect and provide an opportunity to improve cardiovascular outcome of cancer patients in a
personalized manner. Our long-term goal is to identify and institute preventive strategies for cancer patients at
high risk for carfilzomib-related cardiotoxicity, prior to administration of this cardiotoxic treatment, in order to
prevent or minimize such risk. Our central hypothesis is that characteristic biomarkers for carfilzomib-related
cardiotoxicity can be discerned through interrogation of multi-omics data. Our preliminary results demonstrate
the feasibility of such an approach and suggest that the metabolomic and proteomic profiles of carfilzomib-related
HF are similar to those of HF in non-cancer patients. More importantly, our findings support the hypothesis that
there are overlapping pathways in the development of cardiotoxicity induced by carfilzomib and anthracyclines.
The overall objectives of this application are to identify and validate metabolomic and pharmacogenomic
biomarkers for carfilzomib-related HF in MM patients using a multi-omics approach and existing whole exome
sequencing (WES) data from the Oncology Research Information Exchange Network (ORIEN), and in large
electronic health record (EHR) systems, namely the UK Biobank and biobank at Vanderbilt University (BioVU).
We have assembled a multidisciplinary team to carry out the following three specific aims: 1). Identify and
validate metabolomic biomarkers at baseline that differentiate MM patients who develop versus do not develop
carfilzomib-related HF. 2). Identify and replicate germline genetic variants associated with carfilzomib-related HF
among MM patients. 3). Build and validate a predictive model for carfilzomib-related HF among MM patients.
The proposed work is expected to provide tools to enable stratification of MM patients for cardiotoxicity risk
based on pharmacogenomic and metabolomic biomarkers and provide the basis for clinical translation of these
biomarkers. In addition, this work will also provide important insight as to what extent the genetic variants
associated with anthracycline-related cardiotoxicities are also associated with carfilzomib-related HF. Ultimately,
our research will potentially lead to a paradigm shift in current clinical practice to better prevent cardiotoxicity,
and improve outcomes in the MM patient population."

The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) drives viral evolution by mediating both genetic drift (mutation)
and genetic/antigenic shift (recombination) of RNA viruses. RdRp speed and fidelity contribute to the rate of
mutation and formation of the mutant swarm, a well-established determinant of viral fitness and pathogenesis.
For more than two decades, we have used the RdRp from poliovirus (PV) as a model system to elucidate
fundamental biochemical and biophysical principles governing speed and fidelity of nucleotide addition. A major
conclusion of this work is that both speed and fidelity are controlled by the dynamics of a conserved array of
amino acid residues in the active site. Importantly, these dynamics can be manipulated genetically or exploited
pharmacologically, thus contributing to the creation of attenuated strains and antiviral agents.
 RNA recombination in PV occurs by a template-switching mechanism, a process in which the RdRp initiates
elongation on one template (donor) but completes elongation on a different template (acceptor). PV RdRp is
sufficient to catalyze template switching in vitro. However, the trigger(s) and mechanism of template switching
remain largely unknown. Using a novel cell-based assay for PV RNA recombination, the Evans laboratory
observed a direct correlation between RdRp infidelity and the frequency of RNA recombination. RdRp
misincorporation frequency as a biochemical property governing template switching was not expected but
motivated our foray into the study of RNA recombination. Over the past five years, we have established an
experimental paradigm to elucidate the mechanism of RdRp-catalyzed RNA recombination, discover
biochemical and biophysical properties and structural determinants of the RdRp governing RNA recombination,
and reveal the biological consequences of perturbations to the mechanism and/or efficiency of RNA
recombination.
 Here, we will utilize our experimental paradigm to achieve the following: (1) Link structural determinants of
the RdRp to elementary steps and mechanisms of RNA recombination; (2) Investigate the impact of RNA
modifications on elongation and recombination by the RdRp; and (3) Reveal the mechanism and biological
function of forced-copy-choice RNA recombination."

 Ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS) of the breast are a heterogeneous group of neoplastic lesions that are usually
detected by screening mammography. Workup generally includes a percutaneous (core) Biopsy (Bx) for
histologic confirmation, followed by multiparametric MRI (mpMRI), followed by breast-conserving excision, and
adjuvant radiation. Approximately 20-25% of patients with core Bx-confirmed DCIS are upstaged to invasive
carcinoma upon pathology of resected tissue. Foreknowledge of this would dictate a more aggressive surgical
intervention, including sentinel node biopsy for axillary staging. Further, another 20-25% of patients are judged
to have low-risk disease and current thought is that such women may have better outcomes in an active
surveillance setting, and this is being tested in clinical trials. The ultimate goal and the overall impact of this
project is to use machine learning to identify biochemical (SA1) or imaging (SA2) biomarkers, as well as their
combination (SA3) to discriminate indolent from aggressive DCIS, as determined by upstaging upon excisional
biopsy.
 The major hypothesis to be tested in this work is that hypoxia and expression of hypoxia-related proteins
(HRPs) can discriminate aggressive from more indolent DCIS, and that this can be used for decision support.
Expression of HRPs is optimally characterized by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and we have deployed methods
for multiplexed IHC, as well as methods for advanced analytics using machine learning (pathomics). We have
also shown that hypoxic habitats within breast cancers can be identified from mpMRI using machine learning
(radiomics). We thus propose to use pathomics of core biopsies and radiomics of mpMRI to determine the
presence and extent of hypoxic habitats in DCIS prior to surgery to predict subsequent upstaging after surgical
resection. This work will be performed in Aim 1 for pathomics and Aim 2 for radiomics, and Aim 3 will develop
combined radio-pathomics predictors. Each aim will contain: (a) retrospective arms for training, tuning, and
testing; and (b) prospective internal and external cohorts for rigorous validation. For the retrospective studies,
we have identified 604 cases wherein women with DCIS obtained core Bx, mpMRI, and surgery with pathology
at Moffitt in the last 10 years. Internal prospective studies will accrue ~6 women/month who have consented to
the total Cancer Care® protocol and who have their complete workup at Moffitt. External validation cohorts will
be accrued at UCSF and at Advent Health.
 At the end of this work we will have developed a risk model for DCIS that can be deployed prior to surgery to
guide decisions along the spectrum from active surveillance at one end to more extensive surgical intervention
at the other. This is expected to lay a foundation for subsequent interventional trials. Additionally, the inclusion
of hypoxia as a central hypothesis has high potential to illuminate components of the natural history of this
disease."
10888358,"ABSTRACT
Cancer in children is rare with approximately 15,700 new cases diagnosed annually in children 21 years or
younger in the U.S. Through use of multimodality therapy (surgery, radiation therapy, and aggressive
chemotherapy), 70% of patients will be `cured' of their disease, and 5-year Event-Free Survival (EFS) exceeds
80%. Consequently, the number of patients that can be enrolled in phase I/II clinical trials is small, and most
patients will have been extensively treated, hence drug/radiation resistant. Thus, preclinical studies that
accurately translate into effective clinical therapy are an essential component of pediatric drug development. Our
group has contributed to studies in the PPTP/C that have led to clinical studies through Children's Oncology
Group (COG). Of importance, we have developed and characterized over 330 Patient Derived Xenografts (PDX),
developed from tumors both at diagnosis and relapse, that can be used to facilitate pediatric drug development
as directed by FDA under the Research to Accelerate Cures and Equity for Children Act (RACE for Children
Act). Based on our studies, both in and outside the PPTC, we propose to use PDX/CDX models of sarcoma,
kidney cancer, and hepatoblastoma derived from high-risk patients to identify novel agents and combinations,
and to test at least 8-10 agents per year, for which we have expertise. We will explore specific hypotheses to
integrate molecular-targeted agents with conventional chemo-radiation treatment, advanced drug delivery
systems (antibody-drug conjugates, nanoparticles), and the use of Single Mouse Testing (SMT) as the primary
screening approach. In collaborative studies, we will evaluate a new humanized mouse model where testing of
immuno-oncology agents is a priority to treat these PDX models. One of the objective limitations of PPTP/C
testing was that relatively few tumor models representing a specific disease (n=3-8/disease) could be used within
the resource constraints, a number clearly insufficient to recapitulate the genetic/epigenetic heterogeneity of
each clinical disease. Our retrospective analysis of PPTP data, and recent prospective testing in the PPTC,
shows that a single mouse/tumor line gives essentially similar data to conventional testing' (using 10 mice/group
for each tumor line). The advantage of the SMT design is that it allows for incorporation of up to 20-fold more
models, more accurately representing the genetic/epigenetic diversity of each pediatric cancer within the same
resource constraints. The proposed studies will adopt SMT as the primary screening approach to identify agents
that have biologically meaningful activity (i.e. large antitumor effects) and identify tumors that are `exceptional
responders' for validation. The SMT approach, when linked to the molecular characterization of PDX models,
potentially increases the power to identify biomarkers associated with response. Using SMT we can essentially
conduct preclinical phase II trials and simulate the likely clinical response rate more accurately for a given
disease. As part of the Ped-In Vivo-TP, we aim to develop highly effective, less toxic therapies for high-risk
cancers that afflict children and adolescents/young adults (AYA)."

The NIH funded Steroids for Corneal Ulcers Study found that keratitis caused by naturally occurring lasR
mutants of the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa resulted in significantly worse vision outcomes than keratitis
caused by wild-type P. aeruginosa. All the isolates, from India, were obtainted between 2006-2010. Using the
vast repository at the University of Pittsburgh Campbell Laboratory, which has isolates back to 1992, a
concerning trend was observed that lasR mutants have dramatically increased among P. aeruginosa keratitis
isolates in the United States. This is a potential public health problem that this study would help to
communicate to ophthalmologists and optometrists. The long-term goal of this research is to develop
approaches to prevent vision loss caused by infections. The overall objective of this application is to determine
the mechanism by which lasR mutants of P. aeruginosa cause worse clinical outcomes. Our central hypothesis
is that the LasR transcription factor inhibits expression of genes that influence P. aeruginosa survival on the
harsh ocular surface, such that genes upregulated in the mutant confer an increased infectivity phenotype. The
rationale for this study is that identifying the mechanisms by which LasR controls ocular virulence will provide a
scientific basis to develop therapeutic strategies to combat vision loss. Three specific aims have been
designed to interrogate our central hypothesis: 1) to characterize the genetic basis of lasR mutations among
the clinical isolate collection at the Campbell Laboratory, and evaluate the extent to which the mutations confer
dominant or recessive virulence phenotypes; 2) to test the importance of specific P. aeruginosa genes that
have increased expression in lasR mutants for a role in ocular surface survival, establishing corneal infection in
a rabbit contact lens infection model, and in inducing corneal inflammation, and 3) to test whether lasR mutants
have elevated resistance to ocular surface innate defenses and ophthalmically relevant antibiotic therapy. This
study will use a combination of advanced molecular genetics to manipulate bacterial genomes including clinical
isolates, next generation sequencing, and well-established in vitro and in vivo models. This study is innovative
because current diagnostic approaches do not differentiate between P. aeruginosa strains that cause keratitis,
other than antibiotic susceptibility, and this study will introduce a new approach to identify highly vision
threatening P. aeruginosa isolates. This study will also evaluate several candidate virulence factors that have
not been tested with respect to the eye. The significance of this study is based on two items: A) its high
potential to elucidate new pathogenic mechanisms that bacteria wield to establish blinding ocular infections,
and the resulting knowledge can ultimately be used to develop approaches to prevent vision loss due to ocular
infections, and B) introducing a feasible form of personalized medicine that can be used to alert health care
workers to patients most at risk for vision loss."
10828910,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The success of behavioral weight loss programs is undermined by weight regain. Controversy
exists about how much physiological adaptations to the weight reduced state contribute to
weight regain. Further, little is known about the relative contributions to relapse of increased
metabolic efficiency and increased appetitive drive. Even if metabolic efficiency increases with
weight loss, this does not necessarily mean that successful dieters are hypo-metabolic in their
weight-reduced state. To address these scientific questions, we will recruit 100 individuals into a
weight loss program based on a modified version of the Diabetes Prevention Program. Qualified
participants will be assessed at baseline and reassessed if they attain a minimum 7% weight
loss (called month 0) and undergo follow-up assessments 2 and 18-months later.
Reassessment at month 2 will allow us to study the transition to maintenance as a dynamic
process (i.e., change from month 0 to 2), not just as a discrete change of state (from baseline to
month 0). A control group of 33 weight-stable overweight individuals, matched to successful
weight losers on BMI and other variables, will be recruited at time 0 and compared to weight
losers on all outcome measures. Changes in physiological measures of metabolism and
appetite during weight loss will be used to predict individual differences in weight regain. By
comparing weight-losing to weight-stable individuals, we will develop a unique reference point
for interpreting the results of the within-group predictive analyses. Physiological outcome
measures will include: 1) energy metabolism (e.g., resting and non-resting energy expenditure,
2) neural indicators of appetitive drive (e.g., striatal activation to food cues and food tastes) and
3) neuroendocrine responses to fasting and fed states (e.g., leptin, GLP-1). A comprehensive
biobank of blood, fecal, muscle and adipose tissue will also be collected for future discovery
studies. Our measures and expertise will provide new insight into the physiological determinants
of weight regain following weight loss that could help improve obesity treatments in the future."
10886751,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Lymphedema is a chronic and debilitating condition currently without approved medical therapies. Lymphatic
drainage insufficiency, caused by inflammation and lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) dysfunction, is the main
factor promoting the progression of lymphedema. LEC-derived hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-2α is required for
proper lymphatic development and homeostasis; the decline of LEC HIF-2α, observed in lymphedema, may be
directly involved with disease progression. In experimental models, reducing HIF-2α expression aggravates
lymphatic drainage insufficiency and exacerbates accumulating interstitial fluid. Anti-inflammatory ketoprofen
therapy was recently shown to be effective in lymphedema, and treated patients show increased LEC HIF-2α
expression in their skin biopsies. The studies proposed in this grant are designed to address fundamental
questions about why LEC HIF-2α is decreased in lymphedema and how this reduction influences lymphatic
drainage. The grant hypothesis is that suppressed LEC HIF-2α expression, caused by inflammatory mediators,
impairs lymphatic drainage by promoting LEC phenotypic transformation and abnormal cellular energetics.
Specific Aim 1 is to explore the mechanisms by which inflammation inhibits LEC HIF-2α expression and map
HIF-2α-regulated gene networks in LECs. Aim 2 will investigate how LEC HIF-2α reduction may cause LEC
phenotypic transformation, promote lymphatic vascular remodeling, and aggravate lymphatic drainage
insufficiency. Aim 3 will study how LEC HIF-2α reduction affects lymphatic structure and function by promoting
abnormal cellular metabolism. Collectively, the proposed studies are expected to advance the understanding of
the role that HIF-2α plays in lymphedema with the rationale that the knowledge gained can facilitate much-
needed therapeutic development."

The goal of this proposal is to understand how hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) form in the
embryo. All HSCs in the adult bone marrow are descendants of pre-hematopoietic stem cells (pre-
HSCs) that differentiate from hemogenic endothelial (HE) cells in the major caudal arteries of the
embryo. However, only a subset of hematopoietic cells that differentiate from HE cells in the
arteries are pre-HSCs, while many are committed lympho-myeloid biased progenitors. We
generated a comprehensive single cell dataset that captures the entire developmental trajectory
from arterial endothelial cells to lympho-myeloid biased progenitors and pre-HSCs. This dataset
is a powerful tool for generating and testing novel concepts in HSC ontogeny. One discovery from
this analysis is an endothelial cell precursor of HE cells that we named pre-HE. Pre-HE cells are
a transitional population from which a limited number of cells will be specified as HE. We
discovered that the efficiency at which pre-HE cells differentiate into HE cells is determined by
the levels of RUNX1, a transcription factor that is expressed in HE cells and is essential for HE
cell specification. We also identified a candidate enhancer in the Runx1 gene that first becomes
accessible in pre-HE cells. One goal of this proposal is to determine if the Runx1 pre-HE enhancer
is required for the differentiation of pre-HE cells into HE cells, and which transcription factors and
upstream signaling pathways regulate the activity of this enhancer. A second important finding is
that we defined the molecular differences between lympho-myeloid biased progenitors and pre-
HSCs, and identified genes specifically expressed in each of these populations. One of these
genes, Mecom, which is known to regulate adult HSC proliferation and function, is more highly
expressed in pre-HSCs than in lympho-myeloid biased progenitors. We will determine if the
expression of Mecom in endothelial cells regulates the number of pre-HSCs that are generated
during hematopoietic ontogeny. Understanding how arterial HE cells are specified and specialized
will help guide ongoing efforts to generate HSCs from other cell sources."

 The proposed research and career development plan have been designed to facilitate my path toward
becoming an independent surgeon scientist focused on highly translational head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC) research. I have devoted my early research career to exploring epigenetic mechanisms
(i.e., DNA methylation) of HNSCC pain, an area of research that has otherwise gone unnoticed. This proposal
builds on my previous research in which I determine that hypermethylation of pain-mediating genes contribute
to HNSCC pain in patients, and that hypomethylating agents treat HNSCC pain. The career development plan
is carefully structured to hone my expertise in clinical research through a series of courses, national meetings,
and meetings with my mentorship team. Upon completion of the K23, I will be well-prepared to apply for
independent research funding through an R01 mechanism, which will support my translational research program
focused on treatments for head and neck cancer pain.
 In this proposal I take a systematic approach to identify genes that are methylated in patients with severe
HNSCC pain. In Aim 1 I prospectively enroll HNSCC patients, quantify their pain levels with validated pain
questionnaires, and collect their cancer tissue for analysis with a genome-wide methylation array. I will analyze
the methylation data and identify a suite of hypermethylated genes in patients with severe pain. I have proven
feasibility of this approach through preliminary studies, in which I used existing methylation data in HNSCC
patients to identify a list of hypermethylated genes. Many of these genes have not previously been associated
with pain processing. In Aim 2, I focus on one hypermethylated gene and determine whether adenovirus therapy
to re-express the gene produces antinociception in the preclinical model. The project is impactful because it
explores a pain mechanism that is largely unknown. The results will establish the methylation signature of
HNSCC pain. These genes could be targeted with either gene therapy or hypomethylating agents to treat
HNSCC pain, offering non-opioid alternatives and making the research clinically relevant, especially with the
current opioid crisis.
 My mentorship and advisory team is comprised of individuals who have expert knowledge in all aspects of
translational and clinical research, specifically in the areas of cancer, pain, bioinformatics, and drug discovery,
all of which are critical for the proposed research. I receive protected time, laboratory space, start-up funding,
and personnel support. The career development plan and proposed research will bring me closer to realizing my
career goal of developing highly effective treatments for head and neck cancer pain."

This proposal presents a 5-year research career development program focused on the study of Bacille Calmette-
Guérin (BCG) vaccine and the mechanisms of innate immune memory, otherwise known as trained immunity,
underlying its observed, pathogen-agnostic, protective health effects in early life. The candidate is currently an
Instructor of Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School in the Department of Neonatology at Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center, and Associate Scientist at the Precision Vaccines Program in Boston Children’s Hospital (BCH).
The outlined proposal builds on the candidate’s previous research on in vitro modeling of human leukocyte
responses to BCG vaccine formulations and complements her clinical training as a Neonatologist. Under the
mentorship of Dr. Ofer Levy, a human immunology and vaccinology expert at BCH, and complementary guidance
by an Advisory Committee, the candidate will characterize novel immunometabolic mechanisms of BCG vaccine-
induced trained immunity in newborns. The proposed experiments and didactic work will provide the candidate
with a unique intellectual framework and skill set at the intersection of newborn immunology, trained immunity
and systems biology that will facilitate her transition to independence as a translational pediatric vaccinologist.
Infectious diseases are leading causes of neonatal morbidity and mortality, due in part to a distinct immune
system at this developmental stage. The live attenuated Mycobacterium bovis vaccine BCG is given at birth to
millions of newborns worldwide to prevent severe forms of tuberculosis (TB). Epidemiologic studies demonstrate
that BCG confers a mortality benefit to immunized newborns when administered early in life, attributed to
protection vs. non-TB respiratory infections and sepsis. The mechanisms underlying BCG beneficial health
effects in early life are incompletely characterized, while in adults epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming of
monocytes have been implicated. This proposal will investigate the immunometabolic signatures of BCG-induced
trained immunity in human newborns, who manifest distinct immunity and bioenergetic demands. The proposed
study is based on preliminary data demonstrating distinct immunometabolic rewiring in human newborns and
their leukocytes after BCG immunization producing key age-specific signatures of BCG-induced trained
immunity. More specifically, the aims of this proposal are to: 1) Characterize BCG-induced immunometabolic
pathways of trained immunity in human newborn monocytes using a novel in vitro platform established by the
candidate; 2) Leverage an in vivo cohort to identify and validate metabolic pathways that may drive trained
immunity in BCG-immunized human neonates; and 3) Mechanistically probe age-specific metabolic pathways of
BCG-induced trained immunity in vitro.
The proposed project, linking expertise in neonatology, immunology, metabolism, vaccinology and systems
biology will dissect cellular and molecular mechanisms of BCG-induced trained immunity in early life, thereby
providing fresh insights to inform future early life vaccine development."

Chromosomal translocations involving the Lysine Methyltransferase 2A (KMT2A) gene are commonly found in
high-risk subtypes of acute leukemia and produce potent oncoproteins that occupy the chromatin and cause
mis-regulation of developmental genes involved in hematopoiesis. Immunotherapies targeting the cell surface
protein CD19 have revolutionized the treatment of B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL). However,
KMT2A-rearanged (KMT2Ar) B-ALLs frequently convert from a B-ALL to an Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
phenotype to downregulate the expression of CD19 and evade targeted therapy. Genome-wide sequencing
indicates these B-ALL-to-AML-lineage-switching events can occur in the absence of additional mutations,
suggesting that non-genetic changes in tumor regulation contribute to this phenotypic shift. We identified
groups of KMT2A oncoprotein target genes that show divergent patterns of transcriptionally active and
developmentally repressed chromatin in single cells of the same leukemia (Janssens DH et al Nature Genetics
2021). More recently, I developed single-cell combinatorial indexing CUT&Tag (sciCUT&Tag) and applied this
method to profile the chromatin landscapes of thousands of cells from a primary infant KMT2Ar B-ALL as well
as the infant KMT2Ar B-ALL derived cell line, KOPN-8. I identified a collection of 18 oncoprotein target genes
that show the same divergent regulatory programs across heterogeneous cell types in both the primary infant
KMT2Ar B-ALL and the KOPN-8 cell line. These patterns suggest the KMT2A oncoproteins activate distinct
groups of target genes in related leukemia cells, providing the first glimpse into how these oncoproteins
contribute to the non-genetic heterogeneity of KMT2Ar leukemia.
 This proposal will (1) address how KMT2A oncoproteins contribute to B-ALL-to-AML-lineage-switching
events and (2) identify novel therapeutic approaches to effectively identify and treat KMT2Ar B-ALLs with
lineage-switching potential. In the first aim, I leverage the KOPN-8 cell line to identify oncoprotein-regulated
genes that promote intra-tumoral heterogeneity of high-risk KMT2Ar B-ALLs. In addition, I will identify clinically
available small molecules with the potential to be used in combination with CD19-directed immunotherapies to
prevent lineage switching. In the second and third aims, I will apply sciCUT&Tag to characterize the chromatin
landscapes of a collection of primary KMT2Ar B-ALLs as well as normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor
cell types. Using comparative genomics, I will identify novel biomarkers that label KMT2Ar B-ALL cells with
lineage-switching potential and that can potentially be used to target this population via novel
immunotherapies. This proposal applies the genomics methods Dr. Derek Janssens developed as a postdoc to
identify novel treatment strategies to target high-risk KMT2Ar B-ALLs and will establish long-term
collaborations with computational and translational biologists as well as clinical researchers as he transitions to
a principal investigator role and establishes an independent research program at a tier one institution."

This research plan is based on a strong scientific premise that hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury induces brain
arginase-1 (ARG-1) to exhibit selected neuroprotective functions, such as efferocytosis and regenerative scar
formation. In our preliminary studies, we detected spatiotemporal changes in ARG1 expression and activity as
a result of neonatal HI. We have shown ARG1 localized mostly in microglia at the injury site early after injury
performing efferocytosis and persisted in the injury core at later timepoints in the area of the tissue scar. ARG1
inhibition decreased ARG1 efferocytic function and worsened histological outcomes. While ARG1 involvement
in efferocytosis and scar formation in other organs is well documented, ARG1-dependent mechanisms of
efferocytosis and scar formation in the neonatal brain after HI are unknown. I hypothesize that ARG-1 regulates
efferocytosis by providing polyamines for cytoskeleton assembly, and efficient efferocytosis is a crucial process
for regenerative scar formation where ARG1 provides proline for extracellular matrix formation. Using in vivo the
Vannucci procedure (common carotid artery coagulation followed by exposure to hypoxia in P9 mice) to induce
HI, I will test my hypothesis in the following Specific aims: I will define whether HI induces polyamine pathway in
ARG1 microglia, and whether ARG1 inhibition translates to defects in cytoskeleton assembly and performance
of efferocytosis (Aim 1). I will characterize how ARG1 signaling alters cell composition in the scar and production
of the extracellular matrix (Aim 2). I will determine whether efferocytosis is necessary for scar formation, if
changes in ARG1 signaling alter local immune response in the injury core and whether this impacts migration of
progenitor cells to the scar and tissue remodeling (Aim 3). The aims will be conducted using novel techniques,
such as TRAPseq and spatial seqFISH that will significantly improve our understanding of processes in individual
cells and cellular transcriptome in 3D. The proposed project will significantly improve our understanding of
arginase-1 pathway, efferocytosis and tissue regeneration as a modifier of brain hypoxic-ischemic injury. This
project will also significantly advance my scientific growth through learning besides the basics of
neuroimmunology, the multiomics approaches and advanced data analysis necessary for my independent
research career. Dr. Ferriero and I selected outstanding mentors, that together with coursework and research
plans are aligned to address my specific knowledge gaps to ensure my career development as an independently
funded physician scientist and to apply for an R01 at the end of this proposal. The proposed experiments and
timeline are within my capabilities and the capabilities of the laboratory, animal care, and UCSF facilities."

Metabolic stressors and pathologic conditions such as diabetes can lead to pronounced physiologic alterations
in protein regulation, resulting in muscle atrophy, which is highly associated with morbidity. However, the
mechanisms underlying this association remain elusive. Understanding the mechanisms of maintaining muscle
protein content is crucial to improving insulin resistance and overall metabolic health. Adipose tissue is an
endocrine organ that responds to acute and chronic energetically challenging conditions by secreting proteins,
referred to as adipokines. Evidence suggests that signaling mediated by adipokines plays a crucial role in organ
crosstalk and systemic energy metabolism. Because of their direct signaling action, they can be developed as
therapeutic agents for metabolic diseases. While considerable effort has been made to target the adipose tissue
as a component of insulin resistance, the involvement of adipokines in muscle physiology is understudied. My
research training plan will leverage endocrinology, muscle biology, bioinformatics, and newly generated genetic
mouse models as a toolkit to investigate the function and mechanisms of a previously understudied hormone in
promoting muscle growth with potentially fewer side effects. This proposal tests the central hypothesis that
Isthmin-1 (Ism1) mediates adipose-muscle crosstalk that regulates muscle proteostasis. The following aims are
proposed: Aim 1: To determine whether Ism1 mediates muscle growth through adipose-muscle crosstalk. Aim
2: To determine whether Ism1 alters balance between muscle protein synthesis and degradation. Aim 3: Using
phosphoproteomics to discover novel pathways that regulate muscle proteostasis. If successful, this research
will establish a novel adipose-muscle pathway in muscle growth with potential future therapeutic implications,
since the Ism1 hormone itself can be used as a direct pharmacologic treatment for atrophy and disorders for
which exercise is not an option.
 This project will also provide training for Dr. Zhao’s long-term goal as an independent investigator to
dissect the hormonal crosstalk between metabolic organs to improve metabolic diseases. The candidate Dr.
Zhao has extensive and suitable prior training in metabolic physiology, with 13 publications including 5 as first-
author since 2016. The Career Development Plan is tailored to enable Dr. Zhao to gain new experimental skills
and concepts in muscle biology, biochemistry, and endocrine signaling from expert physiologists,
endocrinologists, and biochemists in the mentoring team. The environment at Stanford University is unparalleled
for collaborative and innovative research and career development training. In summary, the strong mentoring
environment and training plan are anticipated to fully prepare Dr. Zhao to launch her independent career. The
proposed studies promise to offer mechanistic insights into adipose-muscle crosstalk to identify therapeutic
targets that can counter muscle protein loss and associated metabolic disease."

Pediatric musculoskeletal infections (MSKIs) are burdensome disorders that consume significant hospital re-
sources and require prompt antimicrobial treatment to prevent systemic morbidity and life-altering disability.
Identifying the causative bacterial culprit for MSKIs improves care by quickly targeting therapy. However, many
children suffering from MSKIs never have their bacterial cause identified using existing microbiological tech-
niques. Blood cultures are minimally invasive and inexpensive but only find the pathogen in 30-50% of MSKIs.
Surgically-collected biopsies of infected musculoskeletal specimens (i.e., “source cultures”) increase diagnostic
yield by 30% but require invasive and expensive diagnostic procedures with potential harm from sedation and
surgery. Studies are needed to identify the optimal diagnostic strategy for MSKIs (i.e., routine use of invasive
procedures versus blood culture alone). The Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) database contains
administrative data from millions of inpatient encounters and could be leveraged to efficiently study the diag-
nostic variability for MSKIs at 52 pediatric hospitals in the United States. In addition, new diagnostic modalities
have emerged that hold promise for pediatric MSKIs but need further study in these patients. Specifically, next-
generation sequencing of microbial cell-free DNA (mcfDNA) from a peripheral blood specimen is a newly de-
veloped non-invasive diagnostic test that uses a “liquid biopsy” to detect more than 1000 potential pathogens.
Although mcfDNA testing is approved for clinical use, this test has not been validated in children with MSKIs
specifically. The lack of evidence for how mcfDNA compares to invasive diagnostic procedures limits its clinical
utility in this population. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recently called for new studies to
determine whether mcfDNA testing could improve care for pediatric MSKIs. In addition, mcfDNA has an esti-
mated cost of more than $2000, and cost analyses are needed to justify its use. This proposal aims to address
the critical need for an optimized diagnostic strategy in pediatric MSKIs by (1) describing national variability in
diagnostic testing and associated clinical outcomes for acute pediatric MSKIs; (2) determining the clinical
performance of non-invasive mcfDNA testing for MSKIs compared to microbiological testing of surgically
collected bone and joint specimens; (3) describe the cost of mcfDNA as compared to existing diagnostic
options for pediatric MSKIs. This project is the culmination of this candidate’s dedication to improving clinical
outcomes for children hospitalized with MSKIs. The objective of this award is for the candidate to develop the
skills needed to meet his long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator studying diagnostic
innovation for pediatric infections. The candidate will build on his research skillset through expert mentorship,
didactic coursework, and experiential training in diagnostic trials and descriptive cost analyses. The candidate
has thoughtfully assembled a multidisciplinary mentorship team with extensive expertise in the above aims to
help him successfully complete his career training goals and research specific aims."

Macrophages serve as HIV reservoir, which is a barrier to cure. However, the molecular mechanism underlying
how the virus establishes and maintains infection in this cell type is much less understood. Elucidating the
mechanisms of HIV replication in macrophages is of vital importance to the HIV eradication efforts.
We previously demonstrated that cyclin L2 is required for HIV-1 infection in macrophages, interacts with and
targets the HIV restriction factor SAM domain and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) for degradation.
However, the details of the cyclin L2-SAMHD1 interactions are unknown. In addition, how cyclin L2 is regulated
in macrophages is unknown. In our recent studies we showed that cyclin L2 interacts with and is phosphorylated
by the Dual Specificity Tyrosine Phosphorylation Regulated Kinase 1A (DYRK1A). While knockout of cyclin L2
decreased HIV infection 10-fold, depletion of DYRK1A increased HIV infection in primary macrophages up to
10-fold. The overarching objective of this proposal is to determine how the interplay between cyclin L2, DYRK1A
and SAMHD1 regulate HIV replication in macrophages. Our specific aims are:
Aim 1: Define the mechanism by which the kinase DYRK1A regulates cyclin L2 in macrophages. We
hypothesize that DYRK1A inhibits cyclin L2 through phosphorylation or degradation. First we will determine
whether DYRK1A-mediated phosphorylation of cyclin L2 prevents the promotion of HIV infection in
macrophages. Second, we will define the molecular domains of cyclin L2 and DYRK1A required for their
interactions. Third, we will determine the mechanism by which DYRK1A regulate cyclin L2 levels in
macrophages.
Aim 2: Determine how cyclin L2 and HIV-1 regulate SAMHD1 in macrophages during viral infection. HIV-
1 possesses no Vpx, but is able to establish infection in macrophages despite the abundance of SAMHD1.
Therefore, HIV may orchestrate the degradation of SAMHD1 through cyclin L2 or other means. In this aim, we
will (i) determine the molecular domains of cyclin L2 and SAMHD1 required for this interaction (ii) identify the
viral or cellular factor(s) that induce elevation and reduction in cyclin L2 and SAMHD1 levels respectively during
early HIV infection and (iii) determine if SAMHD1 degradation in macrophages is influenced by cyclin L2
phosphorylation by DYRK1A.
These studies will reveal how the cyclin L2-DYRK1A-SAMHD1 complex regulate HIV infection in macrophages.
Our efforts will be highly significant for understanding a novel pathway that determines whether HIV replication
is restricted or enabled in macrophages. The potential impact is significant since the dissection of these protein
interactions could reveal potential therapeutic targets against HIV infection."

Despite being one of the largest racial minority groups in the United States (U.S.), Black individuals experience
striking health disparities, particularly in terms of cannabis-related outcomes. One possible reason for this is
that this Black individuals in the U.S. are disproportionately affected by stressful life conditions, including race-
based discrimination, which may lead to higher rates of cannabis use and use-related problems. Racial/ethnic
microaggressions (MA) are more commonly experienced than overt discrimination (e.g., hate crimes) among
Black individuals, yet almost no research has examined their role in cannabis use, including whether
experiencing MAs is temporally proximally related to cannabis use motivation and cannabis use and related
problems and whether MAs account for significant and unique variance in these cannabis outcomes. The goal
of this R21 project, which is in direct response to PA-20-195, is to elucidate the role of MAs in cannabis use
and cannabis use motivation among Black adults using time sampling methodology (over the course of 21
days). Participants (N=100; 50% female) will be Black adults who endorse regular cannabis use. Further, the
present proposal will determine whether negative affect (anxiety, depression, anger) in response to MA
accounts for the relation between MAs and cannabis use motivations (i.e., greater craving, intention to use,
and coping-oriented motives for cannabis use) and use (i.e., greater frequency of cannabis use, and more
negative use-related consequences), and test theoretically driven culturally relevant resilience factors,
including religiosity, ethnic-racial identity, and positive coping with racial discrimination. This proposal can
significantly advance our knowledge of precursors to risky cannabis use and related problems within the Black
community and provide critical insight for future prevention and intervention programs. The proposed research
project supports the National Institute of Drug Abuse’s strategic plan’s Goal 1: “identify the biological,
environmental, behavioral, and social causes and consequences of drug use and addiction across the
lifespan.” It is also in line with NIH’s UNITE initiative’s aim to support “new research on health disparities,
minority health, and health equity”."

Despite intense efforts, the long-term cure rates of patients with acute myeloid leukemia are inadequate.
Resistance to chemotherapy is prevalent, and targets for molecular therapies are only beginning to be defined.
For example, mutation of genes encoding transcription factors and epigenetic regulators cause most subtypes
of AML, but their molecular pathophysiology and pharmacologic accessibility remain poorly defined. We have
now found that leukemogenic gene expression in AML requires distinct molecular interactions between the
pioneer transcription factor MYB and its coactivator CBP. Remarkably, peptidomimetic inhibitors of MYB
transcriptional coactivation exhibit potent anti-leukemia activity in most molecular subtypes of AML while sparing
healthy cells. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that defining and blocking the molecular mechanisms of
aberrant transcriptional coactivation in AML will lead directly to improved therapies for patients. Aim 1 will define
the molecular mechanisms of aberrant activation of leukemic MYB transcription factor complexes that control
oncogenic gene expression. Aim 2 will pursue the preliminary evidence that peptidomimetic and targeted small
molecule inhibitors can be used to dismantle leukemic transcriptional complexes in vivo and develop effective
therapeutic strategies using accurate genetic and patient-derived preclinical mouse models. Successful
completion of this project is expected to yield essential molecular mechanisms and effective therapies of aberrant
transcription factors and gene control in AML, thus providing essential insights into a fundamental problem that
remains poorly understood. This should have broad and lasting significance for understanding and treating
refractory leukemias in particular and human cancer generally."
10875561,"Abstract
Bone marrow (BM)-derived vascular reparative cells, called myeloid angiogenic cells or MACs, are critical in
vascular repair due to their ability to release growth factors and immunomodulatory proteins that promote
endothelial survival and proliferation. MAC dysfunction in diabetes may lead to the imbalance between
physiological repair and pathological inflammation. Cholesterol levels are pathologically increased in MACs
from diabetic humans and mice leading to their dysfunction. Liver X receptor (LXR) activation restores
membrane fluidity in the diabetic MACs and facilitates cell migration and vascular repair preventing
vasodegenerative damage in the retinas of db/db mice (type 2 diabetes model). Recently, we made the novel
observation that MACs are preferentially mobilized to the injured retina from the calvaria BM and not the long
bones, while proinflammatory myeloid cells (myelopoiesis) are preferentially mobilized from the long bones.
Calvaria BM does not increase in fat content with increasing age, whereas the long bones do (promoting
myelopoiesis), supporting that the calvarium may be resilient to the adverse metabolic consequences of
chronic diabetes. While we showed denervation in the long bones in STZ-induced T1D, T2D db/db mice and
T2D rats (promoting myeloidosis), Ferraro et. al. identified neurogenesis in the calvarium of diabetic mice
suggesting a differential response to diabetes in these two distinct BM compartments. Importantly, unlike the
long bones, the calvarium is directly connected to the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), a source of neurotropic and
growth factors including endogenous LXR ligands. Hypothesis: In contrast to the long bones, the calvaria
BM compartment is resistant to the adverse impact of diabetes because the CSF provides it with
neurotrophic and growth factors sustaining hematopoiesis and adequate levels of MACs needed for
vascular repair of the retina. In contrast, long bones succumb to denervation and myelopoiesis.
Overtime, however, the calvarium loses this protective response shifting the balance towards systemic
inflammation and development of DR. To evaluate this hypothesis, we propose the following aims.
Aim 1: To interrogate the calvarium microenvironment (stromal cells, resident BM macrophages, and
hematopoietic cells) by examining innervation by the sympathetic nervous system and changes in
hematopoiesis over the time course of diabetes.
Aim 2: To determine the time course of diabetes-induced changes in the release of BM compartment-specific
myeloid cells and MACs that are recruited to the retina.
Aim 3: To restore calvaria BM compartment in late-stage diabetes using targeted delivery of LXR agonists."
10774325,"Zebrafish is among the premier model organisms for modeling human birth defects and diseases. Single base
pair changes are common candidates for regulatory or protein altering mutations underlying many common and
rare diseases. However, editing the endogenous zebrafish genes to model missense mutations or other discrete
human variants remains challenging. Prime editing (PE) is a breakthrough Cas9-based application for the
creation of animal and cell-based models of disease and for developing treatments of human genetic diseases
because it enables precise genome editing such as base substitutions, small insertions, and deletions. Prime
editing enzyme (PE2) is directed by pegRNA to a complementary genomic locus that contains an appropriate
protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) recognition site, 5’-NGG-3’. Nickase activity of PE2 introduces a nick to the
non-target strand of the target sequence. The reverse transcriptase (RT) of PE2 then reads the RT template of
the pegRNA containing the desired edit and synthesizes the DNA strand. Whereas a recent study showed that
delivery of PE2 protein can induce PE in zebrafish, because the PE2 enzyme is not yet commercially available,
this approach remains inaccessible to many zebrafish laboratories. Moreover, the current method is not efficient
and editable PE range is a relatively small region encompassing 3 bp upstream to 29 bp downstream of the PAM
recognition site.
 To overcome these limitations of PE and make it broadly functional in zebrafish laboratories, in our
preliminary studies we showed feasibility in zebrafish of a modified PE method that uses the RNA forms of PE2
and Cas9-RT achieving editing in up to 20% of injected F0 embryos. Our Aim 1 is 1) to optimize conditions for
the modified prime editing method by injecting different doses of the three RNA components, PE2, Cas9-RT,
and pegRNA, into zebrafish and 2) to establish a PE transgenic line. Our Aim 2 is to expand the prime editing
range. To this end, we will first test whether Cas9 D10A nickase can be applied as a PE2 enzyme to access
sequences upstream of the PAM site.
Instead of using the Cas9 H840A nickase that cleaves the non-target
strand, we will test the Cas9 D10A mutant form, which cleaves the target strand. Nicking the target strand will
trigger hybridization of the primer binding site of pegRNA to the sequences near the PAM site. Consequently,
the RT template of the pegRNA will be located further upstream of the PAM site, bringing the upstream sequence
within editable range. In parallel, we will investigate whether
Cas9 from Streptococcus canis (ScCas9), which
requires a single guanine (G) nucleotide as a PAM, can substitute in PE2 the standard Cas9, which requires 5’-
NGG-3’. Through these lines of research, this project will optimize the modified method of prime editing in
zebrafish and expand its range to facilitate generation of accurate zebrafish models for improved diagnosis,
mechanistic studies and therapeutics screens."
10770565,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the causative agent of several human malignancies including
Kaposi sarcoma (KS). KS is the most common KSHV-associated malignancy, with >44,000 new cases reported
worldwide each year. The population most vulnerable to KSHV/KS are immunocompromised individuals such
as people infected with HIV. Individuals with HIV/AIDS have a higher risk of developing KS when compared to
HIV-negative individuals. The adaptive T cell immune response, especially CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, has been
shown to play a crucial role in KSHV infection and subsequent KS pathogenesis. Although correlations between
CD4+ and CD8+ T cell levels and KS development have been observed, this relationship has not been
experimentally validated due to the lack of a suitable animal model. The recent development of the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) as a non-human primate (NHP) model that is susceptible to KSHV infection and
capable of developing KS-like lesions under immunosuppression opens new frontiers to experimentally validate
the role immune cells play in KS development. Thus, our objective is to define the role of reduced CD4+ and
CD8+ T cell levels in persistent KSHV infection and subsequent KS pathogenesis in the marmoset NHP model.
Anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been used to deplete T cells and induce
immunosuppression in both murine and NHP animal models, enabling study of CD4+/CD8+ T cells in controlling
replication of several viruses. To avoid any adverse responses to murine mAbs when administered into
marmosets, we will chimerize (murine-marmoset) anti-CD4/CD8 mAbs and characterize their biochemical and
pharmacokinetic properties in vitro and in mice, then we will determine the effects of antibody-mediated T cell
depletion on various immune cell populations (Aim 1). We will then challenge immunosuppressed marmosets
with KSHV.219 virus and determine the extent to which antibody-mediated depletion of CD4+ and/or CD8+ T
cells enables persistent KSHV infection and KS pathogenesis in immunocompromised marmosets (Aim 2). The
successful completion of this project will validate the common marmoset as a tool for understanding the etiology
of KS and uncover the critical role that CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cell depletion plays in allowing persistent KSHV
infection and subsequent KS pathogenesis in immunocompromised animals."

T cells play a central role in the adaptive immune system and are activated in response to T cell receptor (TCR)
recognition of antigen loaded on the major-histocompatibility complex (MHC) of antigen presenting cells
(APCs). In order to fully achieve T cell effector function, an essential “second signal” is provided by engagement
of the T cell costimulatory receptor CD28 with its B7 ligands (CD80/CD86) on the APC. We recently
demonstrated that sialic acids on T cells and APCs dampen CD28 binding to CD80/CD86 and that removal of
sialic acids with sialidase enhances T cell proliferation. Sialic acid removal is also synergistic with programmed
cell death protein-1 (αPD1) checkpoint inhibitor blockade for functional revival of exhausted T cells. In this
project, we will develop bifunctional αPD1-sialidase conjugates that are expected to combine the benefits of
PD1 blockade with removal of sialic acid ligands of CD28 to promote engagement with B7 ligands and enhance
T cell activation. We will evaluate these reagents in animal models of cancer for their therapeutic potential to
invigorate exhausted T cells and suppress cancer progression."
10881992,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of both community-acquired and nosocomial infections, which have
become increasingly challenging to treat due to the widespread evolution of antimicrobial resistance. There is a
critical need for the development of alternative therapeutic approaches against multidrug-resistant bacteria that
also spare the protective commensal microbiota, which often provide colonization resistance against pathogens.
Bacterial disease is driven by S. aureus toxins and other virulence factors, which are mainly encoded by mobile
genetic elements (MGEs). In particular, numerous enterotoxins and the superantigen toxin causing Toxic Shock
Syndrome are all carried by a class of MGEs called the S. aureus Pathogenicity Islands (SaPIs), which spread
between bacteria by hijacking the reproductive machinery of bacteriophages. Staphylococci also possess
CRISPR-Cas systems, which provide adaptive immunity by blocking invading MGEs like phages and plasmids.
In this proposal, building upon preliminary data, I will test the central hypothesis that CRISPR-Cas systems also
prevent the transmission of SaPI elements and their associated virulence genes. In Aim 1, I will define the
complex tripartite interplay between staphylococcal CRISPR systems, SaPIs, and their helper phages using
various molecular and genetic approaches. In Aim 2, I will investigate the mechanisms by which SaPIs manage
to overcome CRISPR-mediated restriction and disseminate throughout bacterial populations. I anticipate that
these studies will elucidate both the molecular basis and biological consequences for CRISPR-SaPI interactions.
In Aim 3, I will evaluate whether CRISPR can be used to selectively kill SaPI-harboring S. aureus and establish
a proof-of-concept for CRISPR-based antimicrobials directed against virulence-encoding MGEs. The proposed
experiments will contribute to the long-term goal of designing alternative therapeutic approaches in an effort to
overcome the shortcomings of antibiotics in treating multidrug-resistant infections. This fellowship will support
my training in the Weill Cornell/Rockefeller/Sloan Kettering Tri-Institutional MD-PhD Program, including my
doctoral work in the laboratory of Dr. Luciano Marraffini at Rockefeller and the remainder of my medical training
at Weill Cornell. The training plan outlined in this fellowship project is designed to optimally prepare me for a
research career as an independent principal investigator and physician-scientist."

prepared to support the proposed expansion of CPCCRN from seven clinical sites to 24 sites, which will en-
able CPCCRN to carry out the Personalized Immunomodulation in Sepsis-induced Multiple Organ Dysfunction
Syndrome (MODS) study. The DCC will play an important independent role in assuring regulatory compliance,
human subjects protection, and integrity of the trial results.
 The DCC has two Speciﬁc Aims: (1) Provide independent clinical and biostatistical leadership and expertise,
assistance in study and protocol design, study implementation and management, tracking and delivery methods
for study drugs and biological specimens, study training, data collection and management, site monitoring, study
reporting, interim and ﬁnal study analyses, publication of study results, and production of public use research
datasets. (2) Provide logistical support for CPCCRN (including ﬁnancial management of protocol funds), us-
ing advanced communication and informatics tools for development and tracking of critical documents, including
study protocols, FAQ documents, Manuals of Operation, training materials, IRB and other regulatory documents,
study publications, DSMB reports, and provision of accounting information to NICHD.
 The DCC has played a crucial leadership role during the ﬁrst 15 years of the CPCCRN. Clinical expertise has
enabled efﬁcient design and prioritization of CPCCRN studies to maximize productivity; biostatistical expertise
has been provided at every stage of study development and implementation; state of the art informatics tech-
nology has enabled efﬁcient communication within CPCCRN since its inception. We believe that the primary
criterion by which a DCC should be judged is the productivity of the sites and investigators supported by the
DCC. Investigators have successfully competed for nine R01 awards to increase the productivity of CPCCRN,
implementing 36 studies resulting in 119 peer reviewed publications. The CPCCRN will continue its outstanding
performance with the unique strengths that are contributed from the University of Utah DCC."

Sepsis-Induced Multiple Organ Dysfunction” interventional trial. The newly organized CPCCRN will expand
from 7 to 24 clinical sites (12 Primary and 12 Ancillary sites), which will be the largest NIH Pediatric Critical
Care Research Network to date. We at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) - Texas Children's Hospital (TCH;
Primary Site) and Children's Hospital of San Antonio (CHofSA; Ancillary Site) are very enthusiastic about
participating as new sites. TCH is the largest freestanding children's hospital system in the U.S. and is one of
the best (Rank #4 Children's Hospital by U.S. News & World Report 2020-2021). We have every pediatric
subspecialty and offer every service expected in a quaternary pediatric center. We have an extensive track
record of successful collaboration in multi-center clinical trials such as the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury and
Sepsis Investigators and the Pediatric Heart Network. In combination with our CHofSA partner, we will provide
access to 163+24 beds with 6000 annual admissions, enabling us to participate fully in the “Personalized
Immunomodulation in Sepsis-induced Multiple Organ Dysfunction (MODS)” trial described in the Overall
Component of this application. Our sites have several highly talented young faculty, who have career
development grants with innovative translational research projects, and will contribute to the success of
CPCCRN. For example, Dr. Desai (K12 recipient) pioneered the field of pediatric cirrhotic cardiomyopathy and
bile acid-myocardial interaction (cholecardia). His aim is to improve outcomes of pediatric liver failure through
decreasing circulating pathologic bile acids by novel bile acid sequestrants and blood purification techniques.
Dr. Lam (K08 recipient) develops novel protein to attenuate inflammation through inhibiting leukocyte-platelet-
endothelial interactions. His aim is to improve outcomes in pediatric liver failure and more recently, COVID19-
induced inflammation. Dr. Nguyen, our Co-Investigator, is R01 funded to study mechanisms of sepsis-induced
MODS and to develop targeted novel agent for this deadly disease. His aim is to obtain Investigational New
Drug status for his novel A2 Protein from the Food and Drug Administration, and subsequently, to enter A2
Protein in clinical trials such as CPCCRN. Dr. Arikan, our site Principle Investigator, plans to study the impact
of extracorporeal therapies in immunomodulation and pharmacokinetics of novel therapeutics to build on her
previous work in pediatric MODS with a special emphasis on interaction of acute kidney injury, acquired

CHLA and its investigators in the division of critical care are international experts in pediatric mechanical
ventilation, Pediatric Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (PARDS), informatics and data science. Led by Dr.
Khemani (PI) and Dr. Newth (Co-I), the multi-disciplinary CHLA respiratory research group and its members
have led large multi-center observational studies in PARDS (PARDIE study, 145 international ICUs), and have
spearheaded international practice guidelines related to mechanical ventilation and PARDS. This group is
currently running a highly innovative single center clinical trial using a computerized decision support tool
targeting lung and diaphragm protective ventilation in pediatric ARDS, which includes comprehensive
assessment of post-ICU morbidity. These unique qualifications and expertise will greatly enrich the scientific
rigor and breadth of knowledge within the CPCCRN. In addition, other CHLA investigators are pioneers in data
science, neurocritical care and implementation science, and will bring this expertise to the CPCCRN. CHLA is
at the forefront of collaborative research, with several faculty holding leadership positions in the Pediatric Acute
Lung Injury and Sepsis Investigators (PALISI) Network, the Pediatric Neurocritical Care Research Group, and
multi-center data collaboratives such as VPS, VPICU, and the PICU Data Collaborative. This expertise
underscores our faculty's ability to be highly collaborative in a research network to achieve common goals. It is
therefore not surprising that CHLA has been the highest enroller in a multitude of multi-center clinical trials and
observational studies in pediatric critical care. To further enhance our ability to recruit a large number of
diverse patients into the CPCCRN studies, we will partner with an ancillary site at Children's Hospital of
Orange County (CHOC). CHOC has been participating in multi-center collaborative research through the
PALISI network for over 10 years and has also achieved remarkably high enrollment rates in clinical trials.
Through our two centers, we can ensure that the clinical trial(s) conducted in the CPCCRN capture the unique
ethnic, racial, and socio-economic diversity of Southern California which includes > 50% of patients being of
Hispanic ethnicity. This is imperative for the proposed clinical trial on immune-modulation in sepsis, given the
impact that genetic, epigenetic, environmental, and socio-economic factors may have on treatment and
outcomes. Our site has several highly talented faculty and junior investigators who will not only contribute to
the success of the CPCCRN but can be further mentored and developed into future thought leaders and
clinical/translational researchers through the CPCCRN. CHLA is fully committed to be an engaged and highly
productive member of the CPCCRN and execute the clinical trial described in the application."

children with sepsis-induced MODS. The trial addresses the hypothesis that immunosuppressed children will
benefit from granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and children with hyperinflammation
will benefit from targeted anti-inflammatory therapy with anakinra (recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist) or
tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor blocking antibody). Benefit will be evaluated in terms of duration and severity of
organ dysfunction, and health-related quality of life and family functioning at 3 and 12 months. Dr. Meert and
her research team are thoroughly familiar with the CPCCRN studies on which this trial is based including
methods of sample collection and processing for immunophenotyping, dosing and administration of GM-CSF,
and collection of short- and long-term sepsis-related outcomes. Dr. Rajasekaran has research expertise in the
pathogenetic mechanisms underlying pediatric MODS making him well-suited to conduct this trial. Dr. Meert
and Dr. Rajasekaran have the full support of their respective institutions to participate in the CPCCRN, and are
strongly committed to collaboration with other CPCCRN sites and the Data Coordinating Center in conducting
the proposed research, as well as the inclusion and mentoring of junior investigators in CPCCRN activities."
10915514,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia
The Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN) is essential to advancing the science
and practice of pediatric critical care medicine. The overall aim of this site proposal is for Children’s Hospital of
Philadelphia (CHOP), under the continued leadership of Athena Zuppa and Robert Berg, to continue as a
clinical site in the new and expanded CPCCRN. Drs. Zuppa and Berg, site-PIs for the past 11 years, are
pediatric intensivists with a wealth of clinical and translational research experience, who have successfully
mentored many junior investigators and produced numerous scientific publications for the CPCCRN. CHOP is
a free-standing, tertiary care, academic children’s hospital located in Philadelphia that serves children and
families with diverse racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds. CHOP, one of the largest children’s
hospitals in the country, is a 559-bed children’s hospital with 49 pediatric medical and surgical subspecialties, a
staff of over 14,585, a faculty of 860, and an annual operating budget of $3.2 billion. CHOP is home to one of
the largest pediatric research programs in the country with more than $147 million in total federal awards and
an annual budget of more than $404 million (FY19). The “Personalized Immunomodulation in Sepsis-Induced
Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS)” trial proposed in this application is a large RCT of
personalized, targeted management of immune function in children with sepsis-induced MODS. The trial
addresses the hypothesis that immunosuppressed children will benefit from granulocyte macrophage-colony
stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and children with hyperinflammation will benefit from targeted anti-inflammatory
therapy with anakinra (recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist) or tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor blocking antibody).
Benefit will be evaluated in terms of short- and long-term health-related quality of life. This study builds on
CPCCRN studies that have demonstrated the existence of specific immune phenotypes among children with
sepsis-induced MODS, and successful reversal of immune suppression by administration of the GM-CSF. It
also complements the ongoing NICHD R01-funded study investigating the risk factors for immunoparalysis in
pediatric MODS, of which Dr. Zuppa is a co-PI. This study proposes a transformative approach to personalized
immune-targeted care of the septic child. Drs. Zuppa and Berg and their research team are thoroughly familiar
with the CPCCRN studies on which this trial is based including methods of sample collection and processing
for immunophenotyping, dosing and administration of GM-CSF, and collection of short- and long-term sepsis-
related outcomes. Drs. Zuppa and Berg, and the ancillary site PI Dr. Neal Thomas have the full support of their
respective institutions to participate in the CPCCRN, and are strongly committed to collaboration with other
CPCCRN sites and the Data Coordinating Center, as well as the inclusion and mentoring of junior investigators
in CPCCRN activities."

10893336,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Over the last several decades, cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence and the prevalence of CVD risk factors
have steadily increased in the Central American region, in contrast to other countries of the Americas where
CVD is no longer increasing or on the decline. The rise of CVD in the region has occurred in tandem with
increases in urbanization and widening social inequities, and poses a growing, untenable burden for its limited
public health and health care systems. While research in high income countries highlights interventions on
social determinants of health as levers to prevent cardiovascular disease, less is known about the specific,
intervenable social determinants that can help prevent CVD in Central America. Training and mentoring of the
local workforce in identifying relevant research questions, in the use of appropriate research methods, and in
the dissemination of results to the scientific community, the public, and policy makers is critical to identify and
develop interventions to prevent CVD in the region. To this end, researchers from Drexel University and the
Institute for Nutrition of Central America and Panama (INCAP) have partnered to establish a training program
focused on developing the research capabilities of trainees and local capacity building in the conduct of policy-
relevant research on the influence of social determinants and place-based factors on CVD risk across the
lifespan. Key elements include: (1) a focus on factors at multiple levels (from cities, to neighborhoods, to
persons) and over the lifecourse, (2) the use of rigorous state-of-the-art methods; (3) an emphasis on the value
of interdisciplinary approaches; and (4) dissemination and translation of research findings into policy actions.
The program leverages the SALURBAL Study, a unique multidisciplinary collaboration focused on the region.
Training activities will include (1) training of up to 3 PhD students or up to 5 Masters students; (2) support for
up to 4 postdoctoral fellows and 11 visiting faculty fellows promoting the development of junior and mid-career
faculty; (3) annual workshops and periodic webinars and journal clubs on social determinants of health, CVD
and lifecourse epidemiology, and research methods; (4) support for the development of data management and
analytical capacity on site; and (5) enhanced south-south collaborations in mentorship and research. As a
result of the program we expect to see an increase in the number researchers with Masters or Doctoral
degrees at INCAP, an increase in the number of publications and grant proposals submitted by local
researchers, larger numbers of mentoring relationships, publications, and grant proposals involving
collaborations between INCAP and other countries in the region, greater capacity for data
management/analysis at INCAP, and greater engagement of local investigators in CVD research and
dissemination activities, including policy translation in the region. We also expect to see a continuation
proposal to this training program submitted by INCAP as lead at the end of the this initial phase of the program."
10904909,"CRITICAL: Collaborative Resource for Intensive care Translational science, Informatics,
Comprehensive Analytics, and Learning
Translational research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been hindered by the lack of shared data resources with
sufficient depth, breadth and diversity. There are very limited EHR datasets freely available to the general
research community especially the AI research community through credential-based access. MIMIC dataset is
from a single institution that has a fixed and limited racial, ethnic and geographic profile. The eICU dataset is
limited in data comprehensiveness (e.g., number of kinds of lab tests ~1/5 of MIMIC), data span (1 year, 2014-
2015), and data variety (e.g., no free text clinical notes) etc. Thus MIMIC and eICU respectively have advantages
and disadvantages of data depth and data breadth.
The vision of this proposal is to leverage multiple CTSAs with diverse racial, ethnic and geographic profiles in
order to develop and evaluate a multi-site de-identified ICU dataset, to facilitate accelerate translational research
in AI and deep learning approaches to understand, track, and predict the pathophysiological state of patients. In
this project, a group of nationwide CTSA sites will work together to build a new, more inclusive, multi-site dataset
that is downloadable from NCATS cloud by researchers with credential-based access. This project will combine
the respective advantages of MIMIC (data depth) and eICU (data breadth). The created dataset will include more
geographic regions, larger quantities of time-series data, including pre-, during- and post- ICU patient
information. This will incorporate not only more patient diversity, but also capture regional population differences
and practice variations that could have clinical impact.
Aim 1 will develop and provide credentialed access to a multi-site dataset consisting of de-identified discrete
outpatient, inpatient, and ICU data for critically ill at respective CTSAs. Aim 2 will create federated access dataset
from and develop novel federated learning methods on the part of the multi-site ICU data consisting of
unstructured clinical notes or structured data for select group of patients at higher risks of re-identification (e.g.,
rare disease patients). Aim 3 will develop novel memory-network based meta-learning AI algorithms and use the
multi-site dataset to answer concrete and long-standing clinical problems in critical care. Aim 4 will innovatively
leverage the library network to develop and disseminate open resources for the research community and develop
best practice guidelines for other CTSAs to join the effort. In particular, we aim to support and cultivate the growth
of next generation medical AI workforce for research and practice.
We aim to establish a large cross-CTSA collaborative data sharing for critical care by leveraging the existing
CTSA collaborative networks. With the diversified racial, ethnic and geographic profiles from the above CTSAs,
we will be able to support fair and generalizable algorithms for advanced patient monitoring and decision support.
The proposed project will provide best practice guidance to and set up exemplary examples for nationwide
CTSAs. It will also support the cultivation of next generation medical AI researchers."

Focal cerebral ischemia (stroke) afflicts nearly 800,000 Americans each year and often results in permanent
cognitive impairment or death. Efforts in developing a cerebroprotective stroke therapy have largely resulted
in disappointment: the only approved pharmacological therapy is hemolytic treatment with tissue plasminogen
activator (tPA; alteplase). In this project, we will further develop our optimized CaMKII inhibitor peptide
tatCN19o as a cerebroprotective stroke treatment through comparative testing within the NINDS Stroke
Preclinical Assessment Network (SPAN). The 30 amino-acid peptide is selective, stable, potent, water
soluble, and has excellent chemistry, manufacturing, and control (CMC) properties. Importantly, tatCN19o
was highly effective in vivo in global cerebral ischemia (GCI) models in both mouse and pig (the latter
unpublished), even at extremely low doses of 0.01-0.02 mg/kg i.v.. The parent compound was also effective
in vivo in a mouse model of acute ischemic stroke (transient middle cerebral artery occlusion; tMCAo).
Neuroprotection was seen even at the latest time points tested so far after the various ischemic/excitotoxic
insults (0.5h after global cerebral ischemia; 1h after stroke model; 6h in neuronal cultures). Here, SPAN will
provide rigorous, unbiased testing of tatCN19o in rodent tMCAo models for direct comparison to other
candidate interventions. Several tMCAo conditions are proposed for consideration by the network:
compatibility with hemolytic tPA treatment (the current standard of care) and efficacy after varied insult
duration. To most appropriately represent clinical populations, we propose parallel testing in adult and older
animals of both sexes."
10889014,"Project Summary / Abstract
Genomic methods have catalyzed a renaissance in the way that microorganisms are being studied.
Previously, most knowledge of microbial processes and functions was obtained from a very limited
number of tractable genetic systems. In contrast, current focus on microbiomes has shifted emphasis
towards understanding a broad diversity of lifeforms that are only known from sequences and whose
functions are inferred by homology to known or characterized organisms. Among the primary goals of
our research program is to bridge these two approaches by adopting genomic, computational and
experimental methods that directly test the roles, functions and adaptations of the non-model
organisms that predominate in microbiomes. The first of the three Subject Areas proceeds from our
findings that not only is there a high degree of host species-specificity in the contents of gut
microbiomes but certain bacterial lineages have been co-diversifying with their hosts over millions of
years. We will investigate how this co-diversification has progressed within the human population, and
determine if and how these co-diversifying bacteria interact with hosts by testing their adaptive role in a
dietary trait that is subject to strong selection in humans. We will also gain insights into the evolutionary
history of the human microbiome by analyzing the new resolved strain-level variation detected in
microbiome in a population genetics framework. The second Subject Area asks how new genes and
functions originate in bacterial genomes. Most models of new gene formation are based on the
duplication and modification of existing genetic information, and ignore the more fundamental question
about how completely new genes can arise de novo. Whereas in eukaryotes, non-coding sequences
seem to serve as templates for de novo gene origination, in bacteria there is strong, though indirect,
evidence that phage may be the inventive source of new genes. The proposed research will determine
the mechanisms by which new genes originate by testing the functional relevance and beneficial effects
conferred by new viral sequences integrated into bacterial genomes. The third Subject Area proposes
to address several questions concerning the role of viruses in microbial communities using a newly
developed experimental system derived from viruses known previously only from metagenomic
sequences. This system will allow us to resolve issues relating to viral host ranges, lifestyles and
interactions—all questions that would remain as inferences, or wholly unanswered, if only genome
sequences are available. Finally, we our plan to define the limits of gene exchange among viruses both
to establish uniformity in their classification into meaningful biological units and to understand the
potential for strains with new etiologies, distributions, and host tropisms to emerge."

This proposal presents a five year research career development program focused on the study of vaginal
microbiome contributions to preterm birth among women with HIV to expand the breadth and depth of
understanding of vaginal dysbiosis in preterm birth (PTB). The candidate is currently an Assistant Professor of
Gynecology and Obstetrics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. The outlined proposal builds on
the candidate’s previous research and clinical experience in pregnancy outcomes among women with HIV and
integrates two new domains of expertise of her mentors, Drs. Irina Burd and Khalil Ghanem at Johns Hopkins:
inflammatory pathways leading to PTB with vaginal microbiome research. The proposed experiments and
didactic work will position the candidate with a unique set of cross disciplinary skills that will enable her to
transition to independence as a physician scientist with expertise in cohort study design and microbiome
bioinformatics.
Bacterial vaginosis (BV), an alteration in the vaginal microbiome, nearly doubles the risk of preterm birth,
delivery prior to 37 weeks, and affects one third of women of reproductive age. In the US, women with HIV
experience a two-fold increased risk of PTB compared to women without HIV. Women with HIV who have a
Lactobacilus-deficient/ anaerobe-dominant vaginal microbiota have increased vaginal inflammation, higher
genital HIV viral load and increased HIV viral shedding. The lacking data in US-based pregnant women with
HIV risk perpetuating significant healthcare disparities. It is unknown whether the underlying mechanism
between HIV infection and PTB is driven by vaginal dysbiosis. The foundation of this proposal is based on prior
data documenting vaginal dysbiosis as a potential driver for altered inflammatory pathways and adverse
pregnancy outcomes, particularly among African American women. Women with HIV and vaginal dysbiosis
have increased risk for genital mucosa inflammation and viral shedding. The role of vaginal dysbiosis in
pregnancy among women with HIV has not been explored to date, nor have the effects of ART on the vaginal
microbiome in pregnancy. Specifically, this proposal aims to: 1) compare the structure (relative and absolute
abundance) and composition (diversity) of the vaginal microbiota of pregnant women with HIV who experience
PTB versus term birth, 2) determine the extent to which vaginal microbiota function, measured by median
difference in metabolites (short chain fatty acids), correlates with PTB, and 3) measure and compare cervico-
vaginal concentrations of soluble inflammatory mediators (antimicrobial peptides and pro-inflammatory
cytokines) in PTB. The scientific objective of this proposal is to begin to define the strength of the association
between vaginal microbiota, markers of mucosal inflammation and PTB among women with HIV and generate
hypotheses that inform the direction and design of subsequent studies focused on potential interventions."
10884336,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Human herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) is a sexually transmitted pathogen affecting 500 million people
worldwide. Most of the global burden of HSV-2 disease results from the virus’s ability to establish chronic
infections, characterized by recurrent anogenital ulcerative disease. The severity of symptoms experienced by
those with chronic HSV-2 infection is highly variable, a feature of the disease which remains unexplained.
While prior research has focused primarily on the role of the host in mediating the severity of chronic HSV-2
infection, evidence from studies both in animal models and humans suggests that the virus may also play an
important role. The objective of this proposal is to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of chronic
HSV-2 infection by investigating the impact of viral factors on the severity of symptoms experienced by infected
persons. The proposal consists of three aims. In Aim 1, Dr. Casto will perform a genotype-phenotype
association study to scan the HSV-2 genome for genetic variants that are associated with disease severity.
This aim will use genome sequence data for 100 HSV-2 samples from individuals with severe HSV-2 disease
(cases) and for 100 samples from individuals with mild disease (controls). Some genetically-mediated traits are
determined by many variants each with small effect. Such variants can be difficult to identify in genotype-
phenotype association studies, so Dr. Casto will also assess for other intrinsic differences among HSV-2
samples that correspond to disease severity. In Aim 2, she will assess for differences in viral gene expression
that are associated with disease severity by comparing the abundance of individual viral transcripts between
viruses from cases and from controls grown in vitro. She will also compare viral transcript abundance in
biopsies of HSV-2 lesions from cases and controls. In Aim 3, she will assess whether viruses from cases
cause more severe disease in an animal model than viruses from controls. The results of this work will provide
the first insights into the role of viral factors in determining the severity of chronic HSV-2 disease, insights that
will help dictate the future direction of research in this field.
Dr. Casto is an Acting Instructor/Senior Fellow Trainee in the Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the
University of Washington. She and her mentors have devised a comprehensive career development plan that
includes: 1) Regular meetings with mentors to discuss research progress and career development; 2)
Acquisition of the skills needed to perform in vitro and in vivo experiments with HSV; 3) Focused coursework
that augments Dr. Casto’s skills in biostatistics, bioinformatics, and data analysis; 4) Attendance of seminars
and workshops to develop Dr. Casto’s abilities in scientific communication and laboratory management; 5)
Participation in local, national, and international conferences which will allow Dr. Casto to present her research.
By the end of this award, Dr. Casto will transition to independence as an investigator, running her own lab
dedicated to understanding genotype-phenotype connections for infections due to HSV and other viruses."

 Worldwide, 844 million people are afflicted with liver disease, with mortality nearing 2 million deaths per year.
Liver transplantation is the preferred treatment for selected cases but is limited by the availability of high-quality
organs from young donors (<55 years old), and the morbidity associated with the operation. Cell-based therapy
using primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) is a minimally invasive alternative for treatment of select liver
pathologies where architecture is preserved but there are metabolic derangements, such as in acute liver failure
and metabolic liver disease. Optimal metabolic function of the cells is critical for the success of cell-based
therapies. However, PHH therapy is severely limited by the scarcity of donors, and the dramatic decrease in
metabolic function of PHHs from older donors. Human hepatocyte-like cells (h-iHLCs) derived from human
induced pluripotent stem cells (h-iPSCs) emerged as an alternative to PHHs for treatment of select liver
conditions. H-iHLC have three benefits: (1) H-iHLCs are produced from an unlimited, renewable source: h-iPSCs.
(2) They bypass ethical concerns associated with the use of embryonic stem cells. (3) They have the potential
to prevent an allogeneic immune response following transplantation by utilizing the patients’ own cells. Although,
the deleterious impact of age on the metabolic function has been described for PHHs, the impact of donor age
on the metabolism in h-iHLCs has not been studied. Here, we aim to identify the donor age-associated changes
in the overall metabolic profile of h-iHLCs by studying the transcriptome and proteome of h-iHLCs from young
and old donors and compare the results to PHHs from the same donors. We will study in detail the expression
and function of the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) superfamily in h-iHLCs and PHHs as a function of donor age.
Age-related changes in DNA-methylation down-regulate metabolic function including CYP450 activity in PHHs.
Therefore, we will study and attempt to modulate this regulatory mechanism in h-iHLCs with the goal to optimize
the overall metabolic function including CYP450 activity in h-iHLCs. We will examine the therapeutic efficacy of
the generated h-iHLCs in a murine model of acute liver failure by transplanting h-iHLCs into metabolic liver
failure, tyrosemia type I (Fah¯′¯/Rag2¯′¯/Il2rg¯′¯ on NOD-strain background (FRGN)) mice. The results from this
study will provide critical information about the impact of donor age on metabolism and its regulation in h-iHLCs
and will (1) assist in selecting metabolically fit donors for allogeneic h-iHLCs transplantation, (2) allow future
modulation of functional and regulatory mechanisms through alterations in reprogramming, differentiation and
gene editing, to produce high-quality h-iHLCs with optimized metabolic function for allo- and autogeneic
transplantation."

Projects like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) have generated a tremendous amount of data characterizing
the genomic events in cancer and highlighting the deep complexity and significant heterogeneity that can make
precision medicine challenging. Molecular subtyping has helped to identify groups of samples with shared
genomic characteristics that can be used for clinical decisions. RNA expression has played a strong role in
molecular subtyping over the last twenty years. Integration of RNA expression data with other data types that
are being generated as part of the Genome Data Analysis Network have improved our knowledge of
tumorigenesis and separating driving events from passenger events. Our team has over a 20 year history of
innovation in expression technologies, innovating across generations of assays and projects. We propose to
apply our knowledge, experience, and methods to address the projects that will be addressed in this
cooperative agreement including clinical trial samples from ALCHEMIST or the Clinical Trials Sequencing
Program. We propose to address four specific areas of research including `expression/mRNA analysis',
`Spatial genomics data analysis', `data integration', and “clinical outcomes.” We will provide 1) analysis of RNA
sequencing and expression data, 2) normalization and analysis methods of spatial transcriptomics data, 3)
integrative genomic approaches for cancer classification and characterization, and 4) analysis of biomarkers
for association with clinical and other molecular features. We will provide our data to other GDACs and work
collaboratively with them to integrate our analyses and generate data for sharing with the larger scientific

10890034,"Project Summary
Radiation is a mainstay of cancer treatment, yet challenges remain. The long term goal of the proposed research is to
transform traditional cancer radiation therapy protocols by including a pre-treatment step involving perturbing the vascular
and cellular function of tumors with ultrasound-activated radiosensitizing nanobubbles (NBs). The new paradigm in cancer
treatment protocol builds upon a decade of prior work that used commercial microbubbles (MBs) to elicit a radiosensitizing
effect. The MB radiosensitization effects are primarily intravascular, with significant endothelial damage incurred. In
contrast, in the strategy proposed here, we hypothesize that the NBs will also extravasate into the tumor parenchyma, which
will result in significant increases in direct damage to the cancer cells, in addition to the vascular damage. Thus the effect
will be both intra- and extra-vascular. The tumors treated in this way will respond better to radiation, lowering the effective
radiation dose and decreasing residual surviving tumor. The technique further allows targeting of tumor specific volumes
allowing healthy tissues to be spared. We have demonstrated in preliminary studies in vivo that ultrasound-activated NB
perturbation of tumors results in a significantly greater enhancement in tumor kill compared to MBs when followed by
traditional radiation therapy.
This approach could markedly improve existing therapies and reduce the associated side-effects. This is clinically important
for prostate cancer treatment where collateral damage and off-target effects are common and lead to years of complications
in many patients. Therefore, we propose a set of four specific aims to test, develop, optimize, demonstrate and quantify the
efficacy of this novel technique in prostate cancer. Aim 1 will focus on the development of stable, uniformly-sized
radiosensitizing NBs. The acoustic and bio-activity of the bubbles will be measured, and baseline biodistribution in tumor
bearing mice will be carried out. In Aim 2, the NBs will be tested in combination with radiation in a mouse model of prostate
cancer so that treatment parameters can be optimized. In Aim 3, carried out concurrently with Aim 2, we will develop a
photoacoustic imaging approach for monitoring early treatment response. This tool will be used to predict therapeutic
efficacy and completeness of tumor treatment as soon as 2 hours after the therapy. Finally, in Aim 4, we will test the
combination approach in a large (rabbit) orthotopic model of human prostate cancer.
We have assembled a multidisciplinary MPI team of investigators with a demonstrated track record of collaborative work
in this field. The team includes Dr. Czarnota MD/Ph.D., a physician-scientist and discoverer of the original MB sensitizing
approach now in clinical trials, Dr. Michael Kolios Ph.D. is a medical physicist with broad experience in photoacoustic
imaging for therapy response and ultrasound physics and Dr. Agata Exner, Ph.D., a biomedical engineer with extensive
expertise in formulation and implementation of nanobubbles for imaging and therapy. Members of the team are actively
collaborating, have shared publications, grants and projects, and record of technology translation to the clinic. The team
will ensure timely completion of the proposed research and rapid translation of the approach to clinical use."
10904742,"SUMMARY
Cisplatin is among the most widely used drugs against solid tumors, but it can cause severe damage of renal
tubulointerstitial tissues, manifesting itself pathologically in the form of glomerular filtration rate reduction, hype-
ruricemia, hypokalemia, and accelerated secondary glomerulosclerosis and glomerular ischemia. The end re-
sult is acute kidney injury (AKI). Cisplatin induces AKI, which afflicts 25% of cisplatin-treated cancer patients
worldwide. With few exceptions, there is no effective preventive or post-exposure therapy for cisplatin-induced
AKI (C-AKI). Oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage are drivers of AKI-associated pathology; however, the
molecular pathways that mediate these events are poorly defined. Using murine C-AKI model kidney and bi-
opsy samples from C-AKI patients, we have recently found that both oxidative stress and mitochondrial dam-
age are associated with upregulation of renal apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 2 (APE2). In preliminary ex-
periments, we discovered that cisplatin exposure in vivo increases expression of APE2 in mice and inhibits the
action of the protein myosin heavy chain 9 (MYH9), a key regulatory molecule of kidney function. These altera-
tions translate into impact on tubulointerstitial tissue. Our overall working hypothesis is that cisplatin alters
kidney APE2 signaling, leading to inhibition of MYH9 with concomitant tubulointerstitial damage. Here we pro-
pose to more precisely illuminate the target role of APE2 in AKI development, and specifically hypothesize
(i) that highly expressed APE2 affects mtDNA integrity and MYH9/actin intermediate mitochondrial fission and
(ii) that this in turn promotes renal injury by triggering cell-death pathways. To address these dual issues, we
propose using APE2 transgenic and knockout (KO) mouse models to pursue the two Specific Aims detailed
below. In Aim 1, we will validate a genetically engineered murine model of APE2 with direct clinical relevance
to C-AKI. We will comprehensively define the APE2 mouse phenotype and compare it with that of the C-AKI
mouse model and the human C-AKI signature with respect to pathophysiological features at the molecular
level using whole genomic, transcriptional, and immunomic approaches. We will define the binding site of
APE2/MYH9 and its functional significance for further translational studies. In Aim 2, we will conduct proof-of-
concept studies on APE2 targeted therapy for prevention of C-AKI. Additionally, we will define a novel targeted
therapy to prevent nephrotoxicity by delivering APE2 gapmer antisense oligonucleotides or small-molecule in-
hibitors to selectively suppress APE2 expression in proximal tubule cells in APE2 transgenic and C-AKI mice.
Impact: Accomplishing these Specific Aims will be the first step toward constructing a temporal-mechanistic
map of events that occur upon cisplatin exposure and translate into tubulointerstitial nephritis and may ulti-
mately enable development of novel targeted therapy for AKI disease."
10912683,"Infant feeding is a complex behavior that requires the ability to both acquire milk, as well as transport and
swallow it. Preterm infants often exhibit a decreased ability to generate suction pressure to acquire milk, and
experience challenges transporting and swallowing milk. Understanding the mechanisms behind these
challenges is difficult due to the complexity of infant feeding as well as the fragile nature of preterm infants.
Feeding is controlled by multiple cranial nerves and over 25 muscles, yet we know little of how those muscles
function due to the ethical and practical restrictions of acquiring data on human infants. Clinicians cannot
control for the degree of prematurity in their patients, cannot measure muscle function accurately or precisely,
and are limited in the temporal resolution of their data, due to radiation from videofluoroscopic swallowing
studies. The objective of this proposal is to use a validated animal model to acquire controlled, high resolution
data to study how term and preterm infants respond to interventions to improve feeding performance during
feeding. This research will combine bi-planar (3D) high speed (100 fps) videofluoroscopy with chronic
indwelling fine-wire electromyography to measure how muscles drive the kinematics, swallow safety, and fluid
dynamics of term and preterm infant feeding. The central hypothesis is that term infants will show higher
levels of pressure generation and ability to transport viscous fluids, but that the plastic neural system of
preterm infants will enable them to exhibit a greater response to increases in pressure generation requirements
and increases in viscosity. First, I will measure how the musculoskeletal system responds to changes in
pressure generation requirements to acquire food in term and preterm infant pigs (SA1-K99), and then
measure the neuromotor response to changes in viscosity in term and preterm infant pigs (SA2-K99).
Following these, I will measure neuromotor function of term and preterm infants when feeding on a
biomimetic nipple, compared to those currently available commercially (SA3-R00).This research will provide
insight into the mechanisms driving feeding performance in infants and provide a foundation for developing
interventions based off physiologic, rather than qualitative, indications of poor performance for patients with
dysphagia. This is significant because it represents an important advance in the basic understanding of the
mechanisms of infant feeding, and mechanisms of failure. As such these results will be the foundation for
evidence-based interventions for neonate dysphagia. This project will directly advance my career goals to
establish a federally funded research program grounded in understanding normal and pathophysiologic
sensorimotor integration. NEOMED is an excellent environment for me to develop this research program, as
there are an array of faculty within the department that conduct cutting edge research on musculoskeletal
function, in addition to my research mentor, whom is an expert in the field of infant dysphagia."

HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) infants have higher rates of mortality, infectious morbidity and growth deficits
compared to HIV-unexposed uninfected (HUU) infants despite the success of maternal antiretroviral therapy
(ART) in reducing vertical transmission. Our group has observed that human milk oligosaccharide (HMO)
composition of breastmilk, and its relationships to the infant gut microbiome maturity and composition, may
account for some of the increased risks seen in HEU infants. Currently, no specific interventions have been
shown to correct for disparities in health outcomes experienced by HEU infants. To address this gap, we
propose a proof-of-concept, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of a synbiotic in breast-fed HEU infants. The
synbiotic is composed of 2'-fucosyllactose (2'FL) HMO and B. infantis probiotic. 2'FL is associated with
reductions in mortality, infectious morbidity and growth deficits. B. infantis is included to support 2'FL
fermentation and thereby maximize benefits from the 2'FL intervention. We will randomize 120 breast-fed HEU
infants at 4 weeks of age 1:1 to receive synbiotic or placebo through 24 weeks of age, with a follow-up through
48 weeks of age. We will also recruit 60 breast-fed HUU infants as a comparator group and they will be
followed for the same duration with no intervention. This study will be conducted in rural South Africa, in a
region with high maternal HIV prevalence and high rates of infectious morbidity and growth deficits in infants.
In specific aim 1, we will evaluate whether the synbiotic i) reduces infectious morbidity and growth faltering,
and ii) influences biological pathways related to infant gut microbiome, metabolism, and inflammation while the
intervention is in place during the first 24 weeks of age. In specific aim 2, we will evaluate whether effects
persist after the intervention is discontinued through 48 weeks of age. Specific aim 3 will compare HEU and
HUU cohorts and investigate biological pathways associated with infectious morbidity and growth. Overall, we
hypothesize that the synbiotic will reduce infectious morbidity and improve growth in HEU infants. Our study
will provide novel information on whether some of the excess risks in HEU infants can be ameliorated through
interventions targeting breastfeeding-mediated microbiome and inflammatory pathways."
10828438,"This is a competing renewal of a postdoctoral training program entitled ""Training in Investigative Infectious
Diseases"" based in the Section of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine at the Yale School of
Medicine. The aims of this training program are to: (a) develop the next generation of Infectious Disease (ID)
investigators trained in basic, clinical, and/or translational research (b) develop new insights into infectious
diseases of national and international significance (c) advance the principles associated with high quality
research including adherence to ethical principles and (d) increase diversity among ID physician-investigators.
The program is designed for physicians with an MD, MD PhD, DO or equivalent. Most trainees will be Fellows
in Infectious Diseases, but selected MDs or MD-PhDs with clinical training in other fields will also be eligible
to participate. The highly accomplished training faculty has four broadly defined areas of research: (1) Innate
Immunity and Microbes, (2) Vector-borne Diseases, (3) Molecular and Human Infectious Disease
Pathogenesis, and (4) Clinical and Epidemiologic Infectious Disease Research. Detailed plans for trainee
admission to the program, mentor and mentorship committee selection, and evaluation of trainee progress are
in place. In addition to outstanding research training, Yale has opportunities for study toward advanced
degrees such as a Masters in Health Science or Masters of Science with a concentration in Epidemiology of
Infectious Diseases or PhD in Investigative Medicine that are open to physicians in the T32 training program.
Extensive didactic training is also available through the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, School of
Public Health and the Yale National Clinician Scholars Program and includes required training in rigorous
experimental design, statistical methods, grant writing and the responsible conduct of research. This
combination of outstanding research opportunities, didactic coursework and seminar series, and career
development training in grant writing and presentation skills has resulted in a high level of programmatic
success in training physician-investigators at Yale who choose research careers in academia or industry.
At the same time, the T32 Infectious Diseases training program at Yale continues to evolve and improve,
with the addition of new training faculty with interests in global health, enhanced recruitment of MD-PhD
physician-scientists in part through recruitment from the Physician-Scientist Track of the Yale Internal
Medicine Residency Program, a plan to enhance the number of trainees who are members of groups
underrepresented in medicine (URiM) that leverages a critical nucleus of URiM fellows and faculty, and new
initiatives such as a research and career development retreat. We believe these changes will further
enhance the ability of graduates of the program to contribute to high impact, new knowledge in Infectious
Disease research."

Background: Sepsis is a life-threatening emergency, normally caused by the body’s response to a bacterial
infection. Without early treatment, sepsis can lead to septic shock with approximately 50% mortality rate. Rapid
and accurate diagnosis of sepsis is the key to decrease the mortality rate. However, there is no global standard
for sepsis testing due to the inadequate sensitivity and specificity of the current technologies. The PI has the
ambition to address the critical and far-reaching bottlenecks specifically of concern in sepsis testing: 1) a rapid
and simple method to isolate and concentrate bacteria from whole blood sample, 2) a sensitive and one-step
CRISPR microfluidic chip to detect the nucleic acid biomarkers of the pathogens, and 3) a multiplexing and
miniaturized optofluidic waveguide platform to enhance the fluorescence based detection.
Overview of the laboratory: The PI established his own lab at RIT in 2018. With the overwhelm start-up support
by the home department, the PI is leading an active and interdisciplinary research group with 1 postdoc
researcher, 4 Ph.D. students, 2 Master students, and a couple of undergraduate students. Within 2 years, the
lab has published ~10 journal articles in the fields of bacteria/virus isolation, CRISPR biochemistry assay, and
optofluidic sensing. Exploiting interdisciplinary approach, the lab is working on technologies to quickly identify
antimicrobial resistant bacteria in whole blood sample. As more strains become resistant to available therapies,
the risk for people developing life-threatening sepsis is increasing. The research topic we are working on will be
the key for clinicians to provide quick clinical decisions and increase the chances of survivals. In addition, the
technologies developed in our lab will also lay the foundation for the diagnosis and treatment of many different
kinds of diseases such as cancer, viral infection, and neurological diseases.
Goals for the next 5 years: Our first goal is to develop a fully automated nanodevice that can collect and
concentrate bacteria from whole blood with a retrieval efficiency of 99% and a concentration factor of 10,000.
We will begin with spiked sample and then proceed to clinical sample. Leveraging the unique properties of
nanomaterials and nanostructures, the second goal is to develop a one-step and isothermal CRISPR chip for
low concentration (1 CFU/mL) bacteria detection without front end target amplification. Towards the end of the
fifth year, we will integrate the sample preparation chip and the CRISPR detection chip as a single and compact
unit for the testing of clinical samples. The third goal is to develop a liquid-core, superhydrophobic nanostructure
cladding waveguide platform for multiplexing bacteria detection. The high fluorescence collection efficiency will
enable sensitive sepsis detection with microliter level sample consumption.
Overall vision of the research program: The technologies we are developing will have a broad impact to the
biomedical research communities to understand and engineering small molecules, cells, and tissues. The
proposed work will also advance disease diagnosis, prevention, and treatment."

Background: The cognitive deficits observed after treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs are a significant
clinical problem, with a rapidly increasing impact on the quality of life of millions of Americans. One and a half
million people are diagnosed with cancer every year in the US, and more than 60% survive for 20 years or
more. Cancer survivors have long reported cognitive dysfunction at various stages of the disease course with
associated consequences upon well-being and functional independence. Several studies conducted over the
past decade have indicated that cognitive impairment occurs long before cancer treatment begins and even
before cancer diagnosis. Despite collective evidence for cognitive problems, far less is known about how tumor
biology and cancer treatments can interact to lead to changes in the brain. The present study will use an
orthotopic mouse model of breast cancer to delineate the effects chemotherapy on cognitive function.
Moreover, we will test whether a novel antioxidant is capable of preventing the development of chemo/tumor-
induced cognitive dysfunction.
Hypothesis: We hypothesize that oxidative stress induced by chemotherapy treatment leads to changes in
neuronal architecture and mitochondrial function impairing cognition which will be rescued by MnBuOE.
Furthermore, Nrf2 function is critical for supporting neuronal maintenance after chemotherapy when aberrant
ROS production is known to be exacerbated.
Specific Aim 1: Determine if pharmacological upregulation of Nrf2 by MnBuOE protects the brain from
chemotherapy induced injury.
 Aim 1.1) We will use a knockout model to determine if Nrf2 contributes to the protective effect of MnBuOE
toward AC-T-induced brain injury.
 Aim 1.2) Determine if impaired Nrf2 expression plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of chemotherapy-
induced brain injury.
Specific Aim 2: Characterize the behavioral, neuroanatomical and morphological changes due to
chemotherapy and the remediating effects of MnBuOE in a syngeneic model.
 Aim 2.1) Characterize mitochondrial bioenergetic changes in the brain associated with tumor ±
chemotherapy and the effects of MnBuOE treatment.
Specific Aim 3: Assess the influence of MnBuOE on tumor growth and susceptibility to chemotherapy (AC-T)
in a patient derived tumor bearing animal model"
10904822,"Leveraging linked registry and electronic health records to examine long-term patient outcomes after
peripheral vascular intervention
Project Summary/Abstract
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) affects over 200 million people worldwide. Peripheral vascular interventions
(PVI) are the most common procedures that are performed to manage PAD. Existing randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) and observational studies of patient outcomes after PVIs all had limited follow-up lengths due to
difficulties in long-term data collections. In addition, heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE) for stent placement
vs. percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) alone has not been well understood with the current
approach of effect modifier assessment. Real-world data (RWD), particularly registries linked with electronic
health data (EHR), are useful for studying long-term outcomes after vascular procedures. However, methods
for working with multiple data sources and analyzing unstructured text data are still evolving. The proposed
research aims to address current evidence gaps in long-term patient outcomes after PVI procedures. This will
be facilitated by innovatively apply and refine data linkage, natural language processing (NLP), and effect
modifier assessment methods. Specifically, this project will link registry and EHR data to 1) examine long-term
major adverse limb events after stent placement vs. PTA alone as well as assess heterogeneity of treatment
effect by patient characteristics; 2) develop an NLP pipeline with machine learning methods to analyze
unstructured text data and examine long-term efficacy endpoints after stent placement vs. PTA alone, and; 3)
establish feasibility and updating requirements for the deployment of the NLP tool for long-term PVI outcome
assessment to other institutions. To support the research activities and the transition toward independence, the
candidate will undertake the following career development activities during the award period: 1) gaining an in-
depth understanding of NLP and machine learning methods; 2) refining data science expertise to integrate
EHR into medical device epidemiologic research; 3) strengthening knowledge in current and novel vascular
disease treatment; 4) developing and improving skills in grant writing and academic leadership; 5) training in
responsible conduct of research. The candidate will be mentored by a team of experts with complementary
strengths in surgical and device outcomes research, natural language processing and machine learning, and
vascular disease and surgery. The proposed career development and research activities will develop the
candidate's skillset and expertise and lead to an R01 level application. The candidate's long-term goal is to
become an independent researcher focusing on the development and application of advanced multidisciplinary
methods in the evaluation of surgical and device outcomes in the vascular disease area, supporting clinical,
patient, and regulatory decision-making."
10909954,"Abstract
Combining cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors with endocrine therapy improves outcomes for metastatic
estrogen receptor positive (ER+), HER2 negative, breast cancer patients. However, the value of this combination
in potentially curable earlier stage patients is variable. Our preliminary results examined the evolutionary
trajectories of early stage breast cancer tumors using single cell transcriptomic profiling of serial tumor biopsies
from a clinical trial of preoperative endocrine therapy alone (letrozole) or in combination with the cell cycle
inhibitor ribociclib. Resistant tumors with accelerated loss of estrogen signaling show up-regulation of the JNK
pathway, while those that maintain estrogen signaling during therapy show potentiation of CDK4/6 activation
consistent with ERBB4 and ERK signaling up-regulation. Cell cycle reconstruction identified that tumors cells
can reactivate during combination treatment, indicating stronger selection for a proliferative state. We
hypothesize that resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition in earlier stage breast cancer is driven by JNK MAPK
pathway stimulation and reactivation of the cell cycle through promotion of CDK6 expression or
decreased cell cycle inhibitor function. In Aim 1, we will use a new mechanistic model of CDK4/6 regulation
by cell cycle Inhibitors and Promoters (CIP) that couples estrogen and JNK signaling with cell cycle progression
to measure the mechanisms driving cell cycle activation in a series of isogenic cell lines sensitive and resistant
to CDK4/6 and endocrine inhibitors and in patient tumor cells. This analysis will reveal how distinct signaling
pathways contribute to cell cycle reactivation during estrogen, CDK4/6 and JNK inhibition treatments and provide
signatures of each resistant mechanism across cell types, over time and between systems. Aim 2 leverages our
collection of patient tumors from the FELINE clinical trial to discover the intracellular and intratumoral resistance
mechanisms driving proliferation. Fundamental resistance mechanisms will be measured in over ~300,000
patient cells from 360 tumor samples using single cell RNA sequencing data already in hand to identify core
intracellular signaling states that act alone or in concert to drive proliferation. Next, the population of cells within
each tumor will be analyzed to quantify intratumoral heterogeneity and how resistant populations differ in growing
or shrinking tumors during drug treatment. Applying CIP to project proliferation across patient tumor cells will
allow prediction of inhibitor strategies that most effectively block intracellular and intratumoral proliferation. Lastly,
Aim 3 will apply a series of JNK pathway drugs with clinical potential to design and test treatment strategies that
maintain durable inhibition of proliferation in ER+ cancer cells. Iterative feedback between mathematical models
and patient/experimental data serves to provide a deep understanding of cell cycle regulation and mechanisms
of dysregulation leading to resistance. Together, these experiments will reveal the balance between estrogen
and alternative mediated JNK signaling, and their roles in resistance and provide a guide for therapeutic regimes
with more durable control of cancer cell proliferation."
10896157,"There is growing recognition that the immune protection generated by prior pathogen exposure is often highly variable. Nonetheless, the role of prior exposure to pathogens in inducing population-level variation in host susceptibility, and how selection from pathogens alters such heterogeneity over time, remains largely unexplored. Further, the way in which host variation in susceptibility emerges from interactions between pathogens traits, such as virulence, and host traits, such as acquired protection, is key for predicting how pathogen strains will evolve and coexist in the breadth of host-pathogen systems characterized by incomplete protection. While theoretical models suggest key downstream consequences of host heterogeneity in susceptibility for pathogen dynamics and evolution, there have been few opportunities to empirically parameterize such models and test their predictions. Here we blend theory and experiments in a tractable natural system -- house finches and a common conjunctival bacterial pathogen -- to explore an under-considered but broadly relevant mechanism of heterogeneity in susceptibility: variable host protection generated from prior pathogen exposure. How such prior exposure induces or dampens population-level heterogeneity in susceptibility will depend on several factors, including 1) the extent of prior pathogen exposure that individuals experience during epidemics, and thus the variation in protection generated and then lost via waning immunity (ecological processes); and 2) the extent of pathogen-driven selection on host susceptibility in a given population over longer time scales (evolutionary processes). Heterogeneity in host susceptibility is also specific to a given pathogen, and thus can be influenced by traits of pathogens (e.g. virulence) that interact with host prior exposure. We will assess these theories-- and their epidemiological and evolutionary consequences-- among individual finches with varying histories of prior pathogen exposure, across populations with varying histories of pathogen-driven selection, and among pathogen strains that vary in virulence. The work iteratively merges empirical approaches with epidemiological and evolutionary models to test: 1) how prior exposure to pathogens, via both ecological and evolutionary processes, influences host heterogeneity in susceptibility, 2) the epidemiological consequences of exposure-induced heterogeneity, and, 3) how prior exposure interacts with pathogen traits to influence heterogeneity, strain coexistence, and virulence evolution. By doing so, the project will generate novel and diverse insights regarding a largely understudied but key form of host heterogeneity."
10983730,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Background: With 61% of US adults having experienced at least 1 adverse childhood experience (ACE),
ACEs are common. ACEs, childhood exposure to potentially traumatic events in the home or community
environment prior to the age of 18, are linked with poor health and mental health outcomes, health behaviors,
and parenting practices across the life course. Emerging research has highlighted the cascading
consequences of ACEs across generations with a primary focus on mothers leaving aside fathers. As fathers
play a critical role in child development and disruptive fathering practices negatively influence offspring
wellbeing, it is essential to include fathers when examining the repercussions ACEs have across generations.
Moreover, research to date has not only used a narrow definition of ACEs, neglecting to account for adversities
which occur in the community environments, but has also overlooked the role of the coparents’ ACEs.
Guided by the life course perspective, the proposed study addresses these gaps in the literature by using two
national cohort studies and a robust measure of ACEs (including adversities that occur both in the home and
community environments) to examine the relationships between fathers’ ACEs, fathers’ behavioral health,
fathering, and offspring health and wellbeing. The proposed study will also be among the first to explore the
within parent experience of ACEs on offspring health and wellbeing.
Methods: Aim 1 will use data from The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health)
and structural equational modeling (SEM) to examine the linkages between fathers’ ACEs and their behavioral
health and fathering practices. Aims 2 and 3 will use data from the Fathers and Families (F&F) cohort study.
Aim 2 will use SEM to examine fathers’ behavioral health and fathering as pathways by which fathers’ ACEs
are transmitted to their children’s health outcomes. Aim 3, an exploratory aim, will use SEM and dyadic
methods to explore the within parent dyad experience of ACEs on offspring health outcomes. To successfully
carry out these Aims, the proposed training plan includes building knowledge in the maternal and child health
and child development fields as well as in data management and dyadic methods. The research proposal and
training will take place at Boston College.
Implications and Public Health Significance: The proposed study is unique and results will further the
understanding of how pre- and post-conception factors shape fathers’ behavioral health, fathering behaviors,
and consequently offspring outcomes. A better understanding of the within parent dyad experience of ACEs on
offspring health and wellbeing has implications for family interventions."

 Our understanding of the impact and workings of the innate immune system has increased
exponentially in the past 25 years. Innate immunity is now a complex discipline that
encompasses a variety of topics ranging from innate immune sensing and receptor signaling to
microbial pathogenesis to auto-inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases. To effectively train
students in such a cross-disciplinary field requires a cohesive and interactive faculty unit with
diverse expertise. The 26 UMass Medical School faculty participating in Innate Immunity
Training Program (IITP) represent just such a group. Our goal is to provide an outstanding
training environment for predoctoral students committed to effectively and creatively expanding
our understanding of innate immune mechanisms. This goal will be met by providing
predoctoral trainees with: (1) a solid academic background in biochemistry/biophysics,
molecular and cellular biology, immunology, and genetics through the UMMS core curriculum
and IITP curricular components; (2) an in-depth understanding of rational experimental design
as well as the subtleties of the innate immune system interactions through additional regularly
scheduled journal clubs, seminar presentations by nationally/internationally recognized experts
in the field, as well as by student and faculty IITP members; (3) an innovative, challenging and
focused research experience using state of the art technologies; (4) opportunities to present
research accomplishments at institutional, local, national and international forums; and (5)
appropriate training in the ethical conduct of research.
 The diverse research interests of our faculty will provide trainees with a wide range of
opportunities in both basic and translational research. Particular areas of faculty expertise
include innate host defense mechanisms, pathogen evasion, pattern recognition receptor
signaling and interactions (Toll-like receptors,NOD-like receptors, and beyond), complement
cascades, inflammasome activation, innate-like lymphocyte subsets (B1 B-cells, iNKT cells),
protein structure/function, and autoinflammatory diseases.
 We intend to support 6 predoctoral trainees (Ph.D or M.D./Ph.D. students) each year.
Trainees will be selected based on their academic record and previous evidence of commitment
to and talent for research. Special efforts will be made to recruit a diverse group of trainees.
Training grant funds will enable our program to increase the caliber of student recruits and
create an even more rigorous innate immunity research community."
10914104,"ABSTRACT
Advances in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) have led to improvements in survival. Adolescents and
young adults (AYAs) who undergo HCT are at an especially high risk of developing sarcopenia (loss of skeletal
muscle mass) due to the impact of HCT-related exposures on the immature musculoskeletal system. We have
shown that sarcopenia occurs earlier in HCT survivors than would be expected from advancing age alone.
HCT survivors who are sarcopenic have a two-fold risk of non-relapse mortality excess rates of premature
cardiovascular disease. Therefore, to improve the lives of AYA HCT survivors, it is of critical importance to
develop interventions to increase skeletal muscle mass, metabolism, strength, and function. Skeletal muscle is
highly reliant on mitochondrial energy production, as measured by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)
capacity. Thus, one strategy to improve skeletal muscle function is to increase muscle OXPHOS in these
survivors. Home-based exercise (aerobic and resistance) training is a well-established intervention to increase
skeletal muscle mitochondrial OXPHOS, as well as mass, strength, and function. Another approach is to use
an “exercise mimetic”, an intervention designed to recapitulate the physiologic benefits of exercise. Precursors
of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a cofactor required for ATP production, are exercise mimetics. In
humans, short-term oral nicotinamide riboside (NR) supplementation has been found to increase the NAD+
muscle metabolome and reduce chronic inflammation associated with aging. Exercise combined with NAD+
precursor supplementation may yield additional benefits compared to either alone, but this approach has not
been tested in AYA HCT survivors. We propose a randomized controlled trial with a 2x2 factorial design
testing 16 weeks of exercise and NR in AYA survivors of HCT, with a primary outcome of muscle strength.
We will also examine the effects of these interventions on exercise capacity, use an innovative non-invasive
imaging technique to measure muscle mitochondrial function, and metabolomics to test circulating correlates of
increased ATP production, including NAD+, acylcarnitines, and organic acids. Individuals (N=80, ages 15-30y)
will be recruited 6-24 mos post-HCT and randomized to 1 of 4 arms: exercise+NR, exercise alone, NR alone,
or control. We will use DXA to measure lower leg lean muscle mass, non-invasive MRI to measure OXPHOS,
dynamometry to test strength (primary outcome) and cardiopulmonary exercise testing to measure maximal
oxygen uptake (VO2max; secondary outcome), at baseline and 16 wks. We expect exercise+NR will produce
larger changes than exercise alone in key outcomes, and that changes will be mediated by increases in
muscle OXPHOS. This study will address a shared NCI and NHLBI research priority, namely how best to
prevent the late development of complications following HCT, and thereby reduce the burden of HCT-related
morbidity and mortality. Our findings will inform strategies to prevent or mitigate the myriad downstream
adverse effects of low muscle mass in AYA HCT survivors, an important area of focus for the NCI and NHLBI."
10895598,"This research will develop methods to model active sites in metalloproteins for the purpose of
determining fundamental structure-function relationships for how proteins activate dioxygen, a
process that strongly impacts human health and aging. Artificial metallproteins will be prepared
utilizing biotin-streptavidin technology as a tool to ensure specific and reproducible placement
of synthetic metal complexes within protein hosts. This approach is proposed to be an effective
method to model key properties of the active sites in native metalloproteins, including site
isolation of species, regulation of the primary coordination sphere, and control of the
microenvironments around the metal complexes. One glaring weakness of many biomimetic
systems is their limited ability to regulate the microenvironments that surround metal centers.
No chemical system operates in isolation without interacting with its local environment. There is
a growing body of evidence from structural biology that the microenvironment, a space around
metal complexes that comprises the secondary coordination sphere, has profound effects on
protein function that ranges from modulation of physical properties to delivery of reactants and
removal of products.
It is our contention that the greater regulation of microenvironments will lead to better
understanding of protein function. It is further maintained that the benefits gained from
fundamental analyses as proposed in this application extend well beyond improvements in
selectivities/efficiencies at the molecular level – they are transformative for all types of
platforms, providing the requisite information that is still missing for the development of
highly functional systems.
We propose an approach for preparing artificial metalloproteins that allows for the confinement
of synthetic complexes within protein hosts to regulate both the primary and secondary
coordination spheres about the immobilized metal centers. The ability to regulate these
coordination spheres within a protein will produce systematic structure-function relationships
that will lead to an improved understanding of chemical processes that are directly linked to
human health."

Infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae are increasingly prevalent and difficult to treat due to ineffective
treatment options due to increased antibiotic resistance. Bacteriophages, viruses that infect and kill bacteria, are
being used to effectively treat and cure infections caused by a number of bacterial pathogens. To address the
need for new treatments for wound and pulmonary infections caused by K. pneumoniae, our group has
developed a 5-phage lead candidate therapeutic cocktail that is capable of infecting 53 of our 100-strain test
panel. The goal of this proposal is to optimize our lead therapeutic and its production as well as to conduct the
required pre-Investigational New Drug (IND) testing and benchmarking necessary for the successful submission
and review of an IND application for a phase 1 clinical trial.
The proposed work will be conducted through a partnership between the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI), the
Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) and Adaptive Phage Therapeutics (APT). It will leverage
JCVI’s history of synthetic and phage genomics, WRAIR’s experience developing phage therapeutics,
development of mouse models, and APTs cGMP production capabilities and experience with phage clinical trials.
The goal to prepare our lead candidate therapeutic for IND submission to FDA will materialize through three
main objectives: 1) To optimize the lead therapeutic, 2) To conduct IND-required testing, and 3) To optimize
and scale-up for cGMP manufacturing and testing. The workflow to achieve these objectives is innovative,
utilizing cutting-edge technologies, and encompasses the entire process from optimization and testing to GMP
production of the therapeutic. More significantly, it will be a platform for developing future phage-based
therapeutics for other important bacterial pathogens."

Alcohol during the adolescent period produces permanent maladaptive changes in the brain. Adolescent drinkers
report greater prevalence of pain disorders in adulthood, and functional magnetic resonance imaging has shown
greater amygdala activation compared to non-drinkers. The amygdala, and more specifically the central nucleus
of the amygdala (CeA) is a key brain region in pain processing by glutamate transmission from pain-related brain
regions. The CeA is sensitive to alcohol, however there are divergent results depending on timing of exposure.
In adult rodent models, chronic alcohol increases CeA activity by upregulating N-methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDAR)
subunits and AMPAR mediated excitatory transmission leading to increased pain processing. These effects are
transient, as changes in NMDAR subunit expression and glutamate transmission normalize within 1-2 weeks
following exposure. In an adolescent alcohol exposure model, increases in NMDAR subunit and glutamate
signaling lasts into adulthood in the extended amygdala, suggesting adolescent alcohol effects are more
persistent. The melanocortin system and neural specific melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) are highly expressed
in the CeA and regulate glutamatergic transmission. MC4R increases AMPAR post-synaptically, modulates
NMDAR function, and increases glutamate signaling in other pain-related regions. Melanocortin signaling in the
amygdala modulates pain-related behaviors as intra-CeA MC4R antagonism reverses alcohol-induced
hyperalgesia in adult rats. Adult alcohol exposure decreases MC4R expression, but adolescent alcohol exposure
increases MC4R expression in adulthood. How the melanocortin system modulates glutamate transmission in
the CeA, the longitudinal effects of adolescent alcohol on CeA glutamate and melanocortin systems, and how
the melanocortin system modulates pain processing longitudinally have yet to be addressed. Using a rat model,
we will test the effect of adolescent alcohol exposure on melanocortin and glutamatergic signaling in CeA, the
effect of chronic MC4R antagonism on cellular effects during this period, and we will test MC4R antagonism
during adulthood on hyperalgesia induced by an adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) vapor model. Male and
female Wistar rats will receive alcohol vapor from postnatal day (PND) 28 to PND 56, with one cohort receiving
chronic MC4R antagonism via intracerebroventricular minipumps during this period. We will use Western blots
to measure AMPAR and NMDAR subunits, and melanocortin system protein expression acutely after AIE (PND
56) and during adulthood (PND 86). We will use slice electrophysiology to measure glutamatergic transmission
in the CeA during adolescence and adulthood, and its modulation by MC4R drugs. Finally, we will test the effects
of intra-CeA and intranasal MC4R antagonism on nociception in adulthood. Our hypothesis is that AIE
produces lasting increases in melanocortin and glutamatergic signaling in the CeA that mediates AIE-
induced hyperalgesia, that chronic MC4R blockade during adolescence reverses AIE-induced cellular
effects, and that MC4R antagonism in adulthood will rescue AIE-induced hyperalgesia."

The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a common cause of respiratory failure in the critically ill,
accounting for ~75000 deaths/year and 3.6 million hospital days. The existing paradigm is that the ARDS results
from widespread dysfunction of the pulmonary endothelium, leading to microvascular thrombosis, interstitial
edema, alveolar flooding and respiratory failure, although the mechanisms leading to endothelial dysfunction
remain unknown. This proposal arises from novel observations linking the upregulation of Latexin to endothelial
dysfunction in the lung. We found that healthy lung endothelium expresses low levels of Latexin whereas levels
markedly increase in response to turbulent flow or bacterial LPS. Further, we found that endothelial barrier
function was enhanced by reducing Latexin expression in LPS-exposed lung endothelial cells and that global
deficiency of Latexin in mice reduced LPS-induced pulmonary edema, lung inflammation and mortality.
Mechanistically, we found that Latexin mediated its effects through complex mechanisms, including binding to the
enzyme Src kinase and facilitating its membrane translocation and phosphorylation of VE-cadherin at adherens
junctions (AJ). Additionally, mass spectroscopy revealed that Latexin physically interacts with several other
proteins, including clathrin and AP2, suggesting a role in endocytic trafficking, and syntaxin-3 and SNAP3,
suggesting a role in exocytosis. Consistent with this latter mechanism, we found that Latexin deficiency reduced
von Willenbrand factor secretion from lung endothelium. Taken together, these observations lead us to propose
the following central hypothesis regarding the role of Latexin in lung endothelial biology and the pathogenesis of
endothelial dysfunction in ARDS. We hypothesize that Latexin plays a pathogenic role in driving agonist-
induced endothelial dysfunction in the lung and that inhibiting its interactions with other key proteins will
reduce the severity of pulmonary edema, lung inflammation and microvascular thrombotic complications
in experimentally-induced ARDS. To test this hypothesis, we propose 3 independent but mechanistically
linked Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will establish that endothelial-specific deletion of Latexin enhances
endothelial barrier protection and reduces microvascular thrombosis and mortality to LPS in mice. In Aim 2, we
will delineate the molecular mechanisms by which Latexin regulates VE-cadherin membrane bioavailability at
endothelial AJs by performing various in vitro and in vivo loss- and gain-of-function studies for genes linked
to Src-mediated VE-cadherin phosphorylation and clathrin-mediated endocytosis in ECs. In Aim 3, we will

on its role in SNARE complex formation. In toto, this proposal will establish the mechanisms by which Latexin

10813170,"Project Summary
 Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) are mainly expressed by NK cells, although their
expression has also been described in CD4+, CD8+ and γδ T cells. Within CD8 T cells, KIR expression is
induced at later stages of lymphocyte maturation and is thought to regulate specific T cell effector functions.
Within KIR receptors, KIR2DL2 modulates T cell effector functions, as KIR2DL2+ CD8+ T cells present
reduced level of activation-induced cell death, and poor IFN-γ secretion after T cell receptor (TCR)
stimulation. The notion of a suppressive function of KIR2DL2 expression in CD8+ T cells is supported by the
observation that patients that express its cognate ligand, HLA-C1, showed decreased overall survival and
could not control tumor growth. Our preliminary data show that KIR2DL2 expression increases in vivo in
adoptively transferred T cells in patients and in preclinical models of adoptive immunotherapy. Using a
pancreatic tumor model, we found that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells expressing KIR2DL2 were
significantly less cytotoxic than their KIR2DL2- counterparts in presence of KIR2DL2’s ligand. Furthermore,
KIR2DL2 expression in CAR-T cells was associated with reduced antitumor efficacy, in an HLA-I-dependent
manner, in a murine model of pancreatic cancer. Based on these preliminary findings we hypothesize that
KIR2DL2 behaves as a T cell immune checkpoint, modulating T cell effector function and leading to
an ineffective immunosurveillance. Therefore, targeting KIR2DL2 during T cell manufacturing may
improve T cell performance after cell infusion. We will test our hypothesis by 1) Defining the modulatory
mechanisms whereby KIR2DL2 shapes CAR- and TCR-transgenic T cell antitumoral effector function. We
will determine the overall effect of KIR2DL2 engagement in TCR-transgenic and CAR-T cell effector function.
Additionally, we will determine which regions within KIR2DL2 are responsible for its modulatory function.
Finally, we will characterize both the KIR2DL2 signaling interactome and the downstream events triggered
by its ligand interaction by immunoprecipitation and proteomic analyses. 2) Improving T cell performance for
the enhancement of adoptive cell immunotherapies (ACTs) by abrogating KIR2DL2 function. To prevent its
inhibitory effect, manipulation of KIR2DL2 expression and/or signaling will be conducted and adapted to the
current protocols for CAR-T cell manufacturing. Based on the anticipated results, we will link for the first time
the biological and molecular function of KIR2DL2 within therapeutic T cells. The proposed studies will
increase our mechanistic understanding of KIR2DL2 biology and will generate novel cell products with high
translational potential."

The goal of this project is to develop an accessible and open online asynchronous Structural
Racism course on a scalable platform for a diverse population of trainees within the biomedical
research space. We build on our team's decades of professional experience and engagement in
interdisciplinary scholarship related to curriculum/training development, structural racism,
technology/platform development, and working towards increasing diversity, recruitment, and
persistence of underrepresented minorities within the biomedical research workforce. We
propose developing training modules that address and mitigate structural racism and
discrimination, piloting these modules, and then make available nationwide as an asynchronous
open online course. Partnership with the National Research Mentoring Network (NRMN) will
enable the course's rapid development, refinement, and pilot testing. We will develop the
Structural Racism course and disseminate widely using our national learning and mentoring
platform (MyNRMN) that would facilitate inclusive, accessible, and equitable environments that
ultimately cater to the recruitment and persistence of individuals within the biomedical research
space. Hosting and delivery of the course on the MyNRMN platform brings both the scalability (to
thousands of learners) and accessibility (open/free and web-based) for widespread impact by
offering an on-demand training opportunity to individuals across disciplines and career stages
within the biomedical research workforce. The dynamic, asynchronous nature of the course is
intended to be flexible for adaptation by NIH-funded training programs, higher education
institutions, and professional societies. We will pilot test the structural racism course with NRMN
students and faculty (from across the nation) to evaluate the course and curriculum and determine
changes that need to be implemented to prepare the course for national rollout. Our multifaceted
dissemination plan will target diverse individuals across disciplines and career levels. The specific
aims are: Aim 1: Develop a structural racism course curriculum and build the course as an
asynchronous open online course. Aim 2: Pilot test and revise the asynchronous open online
course that addresses structural racism and discrimination with individuals from all career stages.
Aim 3: Disseminate the asynchronous open online course nationwide through evidence-based
strategies. The expected outcomes from this project will be a freely available, accessible, and
online Structural Racism course that addresses structural racism and discrimination."

lead to new participant referrals to our center, enhance expert and lay knowledge of AD/ADRD, and
can be used in other ADRCs. By providing participants who can participate in the CC cohort and ADRC
affiliated studies, the ORE core facilitates National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) milestones related
to Translational & Clinical Research; and Biomarkers & Diagnosis. The ORE core also ensures
adequate numbers of Black participants enroll in our CC cohort and affiliated local and national studies,
addressing NAPA milestone, Population Studies, Precision Medicine & Health Disparities. The ORE
Core team will continue to collaborate with our Data Management and Statistics (DMS) core to
characterize and track participants, and help the Clinical, Genetic, Biomarker, and Neuropathology
cores by creating materials to explain research procedures including lumbar punctures, PET scans,
genetic tests, and brain donation. To achieve NAPA goals, Expand Supports for People with AD and
Their Families, and Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement, the ORE core partners with local
organizations including our BU ADRC Community Action Council, the Massachusetts ADRC, the
Alzheimer's Association of MA/NH, the Boston VA, the Bedford VA, the Concussion Legacy
Foundation, the City of Boston, and other groups. To enroll participants, we will use innovative
programs: recruitment coordinators as Navigators; aiding recruitment while educating with Student
Ambassadors; educating, retaining, and guiding participants into research with our AgeWISE program;
educating and recruiting participants with our 7 Steps Talks; and our books. Additional outreach,
recruitment, retention, and engagement strategies include our key partnerships, website, social media,
brochures, newsletters, talks, memory screenings, clinic recruitment, seminars, participation at
community events, “Thank You” retention brunch, and disclosure of genetic and biomarker information.
Referrals to our center are generated by our ADRC Lecture Series and other professional education

(BU ADRC) will be led by three clinician-scientists with experience in biomarker development and validation: Lee
Goldstein, M.D., Ph.D. and Wendy Qiu, M.D., Ph.D., who will serve as co-leaders, and Ronald Killiany, Ph.D.,
who will lead the neuroimaging component. The Biomarker Core will leverage their expertise and existing
institutional resources to focus on fluid biospecimen and neuroimaging biomarkers relevant to Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD), including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The goal of the
Biomarker Core is to collaborate with other cores and centralize biomarker initiatives to support the BU ADRC
mission to improve early and accurate diagnosis, differentiation, and monitoring of AD and ADRDs, including
CTE. The new Biomarker Core will bank, distribute, and analyze fluid biospecimens and neuroimaging data for
shared use by investigators within and outside the BU ADRC and allied national consortia. We will focus on
established biofluid and neuroimaging biomarkers (Amyloid-Tau-Neurodegeneration A/T/N NIA-AA Research
Framework) with the goal of identifying differences between AD and ADRDs. The Core will also conduct
discovery-based development of novel emerging biofluid and neuroimaging biomarkers to enable earlier and
more accurate detection, differential diagnosis, staging, and tracking of AD and ADRDs across the disease

research, and to build foundations for translational studies using ADRC resources. Given the centrality of
genetics and `omics data to diverse scientific areas, unrealistic expectations that most AD researchers are
capable and can afford to generate such data, and importance of avoiding costly duplicative data generation in
order to preserve limited and precious specimen resources, the GMP Core will generate an array of genetic and

molecular characterization of BU ADC participants and other cohorts that has led to numerous important
discoveries and greatly increased our understanding of mechanisms and biological pathways leading to AD. We
will continue to serve as a centralized resource for the organization and analysis of genetic data within the ADRC
and ADRC affiliated projects by providing an infrastructure needed to coordinate molecular research efforts that
will lead to a better understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships for dementia and related
endophenotypes. Specifically, the GMP Core will (1) process, extract DNA and RNA, store and distribute genetic
material extracted from biological specimens (e.g., blood, brain, saliva) obtained from ADRC participants; (2)
generate genome-wide array, DNA and RNA sequence, epigenetic and lipidomic data for use by ADRC and
other BU investigators, as well as the scientific community; (3) track the collection and usage of genetic material;
(4) manage all genetic and `omic data in collaboration with the Data Management & Statistics (DMS) Core; (5)
maintain an integrated genetic and `omic database includes all genetic and `omic data generated from BU ADRC
samples, as well as working libraries of extant genetic and `omic data; these data will be available with proper

leveraging the BU ADRC's data-rich environment featuring access to world-class cohorts such
as the Framingham Heart Study, the DIAGNOSE CTE Study, next-generation digital and
biomarker datasets, as well as diverse and inclusive research populations found in the BU
ADRC's Hope Study. The REC will use the unique expertise of the BU ADRC and affiliated
faculty to provide advanced research training as it relates to common themes of
neurodegeneration in AD/ADRD and related investigative treatments. The REC program goals
are: (1) to maintain 4 postdoctoral/early-career trainees for 2-year terms among 3 different
tracks: (a) a basic science track; (b) a clinical science track; and (c) a data management and
biostatistics track; (2) to ensure at least half of REC trainees are underrepresented groups and
(3) to enable trainees to transition to independence. The scientific and research training of the
REC will be focused on (1) AD, including its pathology, pathophysiology, risk factors, genetics,
biomarkers, clinical symptoms, and behavioral manifestations, and (2) common and distinct
themes related to neurodegeneration, including how pathology, pathophysiology, risk factors,
genetics, biomarkers, clinical symptoms, and behavioral manifestations of AD compare and
contrast to other ADRD.
The BU ADRC REC is committed to developing a diverse cohort of independent AD/ADRD
researchers from advanced trainees and early-career faculty, savvy in working across rich
cohort studies to unlock central mechanisms in the detection and treatment of dementia. We will
achieve this objective, and serve the other Cores in this application, by providing didactic and
practical training in essential basic and translational research and clinical fundamentals of
AD/ADRD, training in research fundamentals and critical professional skills, with an emphasis
on the responsible conduct of research with animal and human subjects, and diverse and
vulnerable populations, and high quality, individualized, detailed mentorship to prepare a
diverse cohort of trainees for independent investigator status in AD/ADRD research."
10874637,"PROJECT SUMMARY – COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT 
The proposed Resource for Quantitative Elemental Mapping for the Life Sciences has the potential for 
extraordinary impact on biomedical research through the development of technologies, methods, and software 
that will dramatically improve the ability of researchers to address significant questions in biology and clinical 
research concerning human health and disease. Consequently, the adoption and dissemination of Resource 
technologies is extremely important to the Resource leadership and technology teams. 
Our approach to achieving the goals of enhancing collaboration and providing access to Resource capabilities 
is built upon the solicitation, evaluation and selection of Collaboration and Service (C&S) projects. Eight 
prospective Collaboration and Service projects, which cover a range of biology and disease in humans, model 
organisms, and pathogens, have already been identified. This list is a modest snapshot of a much larger 
research community encompassing >2,300 active NIH-funded research programs focused on specific metals. 
The Resource will develop an informed, competent user base that is prepared to adopt the new methods and 
technologies. We will use a Visiting Scholar program, analytical imaging workshops, conference presentations 
and annual “Inorganic Signatures of Life” symposia, to educate and train users and promote adoption of new 
technologies. Resource technical staff, with extensive experience in technical training will provide investigators 
and students with direct hands-on training in instrument usage, data acquisition, and interpretation across the 
entire range of Resource technologies. We will partner with professional societies to offer a short course on new 
technologies for elemental detection and localization. 
Our strategies for technology dissemination will include providing online access to Resource software and 
downloadable SOPs for sample preparation and workflows and specifications for instrument customization and 
development. Importantly, we will provide robust web presence for the Resource through the development of a 
Resource Portal. Access to mature Resource technologies will leverage robust mechanisms for external usage 
of instrumentation and expertise in place for core facility usage at Northwestern and user access protocols on 
the ANL campus. Dual project leads located on the Northwestern and ANL campuses will ensure coordination 
and integration of CE activities across the Resource. In addition, we will pursue commercialization of 
technologies, where appropriate, such as the photoacoustic microscopy methods under development. 
We will assess the impact of these dissemination activities on the adoption of the new technologies by tracking 
publications in which these technologies are used and/or the P41 grant award is cited. We will also review the 
literature annually to determine how these technologies have opened new areas of inquiry and stimulated new 
innovations."
10880622,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Understanding peripheral tolerance and the maintenance of immune system homeostasis are vital in the
control of human diseases. We have previously demonstrated that anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-37
participates in immune tolerance by generating semi-mature tolerogenic dendritic cells (DCs) in antigen-
specific adaptive immune responses. IL-37 is one of eleven IL-1 family members and the only known member
to be broadly anti-inflammatory. In our recent project, we found IL-37 levels were elevated in multiple human
immune cell types, specifically in regulatory T cells (Tregs) cells. Further analysis revealed that human Treg
cells express the highest IL-37 levels among all T-cell subsets and that intracellular expression of IL-37
correlates with the expression of master transcriptional regulator, FOXP3, in human Treg cells. Our current
project hypothesizes that elevated IL-37 expression stabilizes Treg cells and induces potent immune
suppression by controlling FOXP3 expression. IL-37 is not expressed in mice, but using transgenic mice and
peripheral blood T cells from human donors, we generated strong preliminary data to support our hypothesis.
In this grant proposal, we will use human primary Treg cells and T cell lines overexpressing IL-37 and its
mutant form to elucidate the biological and molecular mechanisms of IL-37 in controlling human Treg cell
function. Since our proposal uses human T cells, the results could be easily translated into clinical medicine
and patient care. Our findings will have an immense translational impact on many human diseases such as
autoimmunity and transplantation."
10861008,"Project Summary/Abstract
Castration-resistant prostate cancer is associated with substantial clinical, pathologic, and molecular
heterogeneity; most tumors remain driven by androgen receptor (AR) signaling, which has clinical implications
for patient selection for AR-directed therapies. However, histologic and clinical resistance phenotypes can also
emerge after prolonged AR pathway inhibition, in which the tumors become less dependent on AR signaling
(referred to as ‘androgen indifferent’). These highly aggressive and lethal tumors, termed treatment-emergent
neuroendocrine prostate cancer (t-NEPC), are clonally derived from adenocarcinoma through lineage plasticity
or transdifferentiation. There is an urgent need for novel targets and therapies for t-NEPC. t-NEPC cells carry
recurrent genetic and epigenetic alterations as an adaptive response, thus suggesting that key molecular
pathways and drivers controlling cell fate may be used as targets for therapeutic intervention. N6-
methyladenosine (m6A) is an abundant internal RNA modification in eukaryote messenger RNAs. Despite its
functional importance in different types of cancer, their specific role in prostate cancer progression and therapy
resistance still remains elusive. Our integrative analysis of phosphoproteome, epitranscriptome, transcriptome,
and ribosome profiling using in vitro and in vivo models identified m6A as exciting new epigenetic mark
underlying prostate cancer lineage transition and therapeutic resistance. We therefore hypothesize that m6A
drives lineage plasticity and is dynamically regulated by antiandrogen in prostate cancer, and that targeting
m6A can reverse the lineage transformation, thereby restoring sensitivity to antiandrogen therapy in t-NEPC.
We will test our central hypothesis by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) Determine the functional
significance of m6A RNA epigenetics for therapeutic resistance in prostate cancer; (2) Elucidate the molecular
mechanisms of m6A function in prostate cancer lineage plasticity and antiandrogen resistance; and (3)
Establish the therapeutic potential of inhibitors tageting m6A for treatment of t-NEPC. The outcomes of this
project are expected to open new avenues for t-NEPC therapeutics in linking m6A RNA epigenetics to lineage
plasticity-mediated therapy resistance, and should have a profound impact on our approach to tackle the
greatest challenges facing patients with treatment-emergent maligancies."
10854903,"Approximately 90% of pediatric central nervous system tumor (CNST) survivors, treated with radiotherapy,
experience radiotherapy-induced brain injury (RIBI) and neurocognitive decline later in life. This is a progressive
treatment-related side effect, which impacts the quality of life of pediatric CNST survivors. Since more pediatric
patients are surviving cancer, there is a growing need for RIBI prophylactic and therapeutic strategies. Chronic
oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are key contributors to RIBI. Thus, neuroprotective strategies to reduce
oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are being explored. Neuroengineering strategies using regenerative
stem cells to repair RIBI are also being explored. However, prolonging the survival of transplanted stem cells at
injury sites is a challenge, partly due to chronic oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Accordingly, strategies
to improve transplanted stem cell survival are on the horizon. For these strategies to be effective, drug delivery
systems capable of effectively delivering neuroprotective drugs to brain injuries are greatly needed. Also critical
for clinical translation efforts are methods to noninvasively image drug delivery and tissue responses to therapy.
Nanotechnology in combination with image-guided neuro-interventional procedures are promising for drug
delivery. In addition, diamagnetic chemical exchange saturation transfer magnetic resonance imaging (CEST
MRI) is a promising MRI technique that can be used to noninvasively and directly image organic drugs. Although,
CEST MRI is based on a magnetic resonance spectroscopic (MRS) technique, it is more sensitive (~1000 times)
than MRS. Furthermore, given the inherent correlation between CEST MRI signals, pH, and oxidative stress, it
can also be used to image changes in tissue oxidative stress, in response to effective drug delivery. We propose
to develop CEST MRI theranostic biosensors and complementary CEST MRI nanotheranostic agents for image-
guided combination therapy of RIBI. In Aim 1, neuroprotective drugs will be screened by CEST MRI, and each
drug’s potential to serve as a pH-dependent CEST MRI theranostic biosensor will be evaluated in our preclinical
RIBI model. The feasibility of imaging changes in tissue oxidative stress in vivo with the CEST MRI theranostic
agents will also be evaluated. In Aim 2, we will develop oxidative stress-activable CEST MRI nanotheranostic
biosensors and evaluate each agent’s potential to sustainably reduce oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in
our RIBI model. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the feasibility of improving transplanted stem cell survival and
neurorepair in our RIBI model, by sustainably reducing oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Stem cell
survival will be imaged with our stem cell tracking MRI biosensor, capable of noninvasively imaging stem cell
delivery, migration and survival. All results will be validated with multi-parametric MRI; PET imaging of
neuroinflammation, using the translocator protein radiotracer [(11)C]DPA-713; behavioral tests of memory and
learning; histology and immunohistochemistry. This project will advance the development of neuroprotective and
neuroengineering strategies for RIBI in pediatric CNS survivors, ultimately improving their quality of life."
10828911,"Obesity is a major contributor to human illness and health care costs by virtue of its functional associations with
type 2 diabetes, hypertension, fatty liver, dyslipidemias, various cancers, degenerative brain disease and, very
recently, contribution to morbidity and mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Modest weight loss can
mitigate the severity – or entirely reverse - many of these phenotypes. Maintenance of a 10% reduced body in
obese or lean individuals invokes homeostatic changes in energy expenditure (decreased) and hunger
(increased) that tend to restore body weight. These changes are conveyed by persistent complex molecular-
physiological processes in the brain and autonomic nervous systems, thyroid and leptin axes, skeletal muscle,
and adipose tissue. Individuals differ in the intensity of these responses, perhaps accounting for differences in
long-term success for weight loss maintenance. This study prospectively examines the behavioral and molecular
physiology of these systems following a lifestyle-mediated 10% weight reduction in individuals with overweight
or obesity, and examines the contributions of these factors to amount of weight regain in the one year period
following achievement of the weight reduction during a period of minimum clinical intervention. Our Specific
Experimental Aims are to:
 1. Examine the behavioral, metabolic, and environmental impacts on success in sustaining 10% weight loss
 by measuring the association of (a) ad lib energy intake (EI), (b) 24h energy expenditure (EE); and (c) the
 individual’s food environment at reduced body weight on changes in body weight and fat mass one year
 following achievement of 10% weight reduction.
 2. Assess the physiology of the weight-reduced state in dynamic circumstances in order to provide predictors
 of weight outcome at 12 months after 10% weight loss. EI and EE will be measured: (a) in response to a
 single dose of leptin administered after achievement of reduced body weight; (b) 6 months following weight
loss.
 3. Generate mechanistically-informed regression equations predicting change in body weight in the 12
 months following 10% weight loss. “Endophenotypes” related to EI and EE will be measured in the weight-
 reduced state: food-choice task performance associated with food intake and fMRI activity in the dorsal
 striatum; sleep/circadian rhythms; skeletal muscle contractile efficiency (in vivo and ex vivo), plasma
 metabolomics /exposomics and endocrines, urinary catecholamines, gene expression and epigenetics of
 adipose tissue and muscle, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These endophenotypes, EI and EE,
 will be used to generate predictive equations that will quantify the relative contributions of these factors and
 suggest possible interventions to assist in long-term maintenance of reduced body weight."

In the past decade, checkpoint blockade immunotherapies have greatly improved the overall survival of
advanced melanoma patients. However, these therapies have failed to treat many other cancer types, including
cancers of the pancreas, liver, and stomach. Understanding the successful tumor protective immune responses
in long term cancer survivors could promote the understanding of anti-tumor immune responses and the
development of novel therapeutic strategies. Melanoma patients who developed dermal immune-related adverse
events (irAEs), including rash and vitiligo, have better overall survival than those unaffected patients. However,
the immune mechanisms linking dermal irAEs with exceptional anti-tumor immunity remain unknown. Thus,
specific aim 1 will comprehensively characterize the phenotype, persistence, antigen specificity, and localization
of anti-tumoral T cell responses in both vitiligo and rash affected melanoma survivors using single-cell RNA-seq,
single-cell TCR-seq, bulk TCR-seq and 10X spatial transcriptomics. I hypothesize that compared to unaffected
melanoma patients, dermal irAE patients maintain more durable proinflammatory T cell responses with a more
tumor-focused TCR repertoire. This project will be conducted at the Norris-Cotton Cancer Center (NCCC), well
supported by a collaborative team including medical oncologist, surgeon, dermatologist and immunologist. The
Sponsor’s lab houses expertise in tumor immunology, memory T cell and translational research and the sponsor
has rich experiences in mentoring graduate students. The trainings will be focused on knowledge and novel
technical skills such as the 10X spatial transcriptomics to successfully finish the research project. In addition,
developing professionals for the transition to the K00 phase is also an important training objective. Transitioning
to the K00 phase, the research focus will be cancer immunotherapy resistance mechanisms and the
development of novel immunotherapeutic strategies that leverage microbiome. Intratumoral microbiomes were
recently found to promote successful tumor immunity even in ‘immune-cold’ cancer types, yet the exact molecular
and cellular mechanisms remain unknown. I hypothesize that certain microbiomes could reprogram immune
cells and the tumor cells themselves, leading to a more proinflammatory anti-tumor microenvironment. The
research will be conducted in an outstanding cancer immunology lab combining leaderships in both translational
human research and mechanistic fundamental studies in pre-clinical models. The research trainings will be
focused on using mouse models, genomics, epigenomics, metabolomics and cellular immunology approaches
to identify the critical mechanisms to overcome immunotherapy resistant cancer growth. The goal by the end of
the F99/K00 trainings is to understand the features of tumor protective immune responses and the optimal design
of novel cancer immunotherapies. These trainings will provide critical knowledge and skills for the ultimate career
goal to establish a research group in academia focusing on developing successful immunotherapeutic regimens."

A time-sensitive window of opportunity exists in preventing and treating type 2 diabetes (T2D) in youth where
the identification of new molecular targets could be used for disease prevention and control. The key objectives
of this proposal are twofold. First, this proposal provides a combined strategy of didactic training and mentored
training for (a) the measurement of single-cell chromatin accessibility and single-cell transcription factors
associated with T2D using innovative wet-lab techniques; (b) bioinformatics, including machine learning, for the
integration of multi-omic, clinical, and sociodemographic data to classify phenotypes of T2D; and (c) leadership
and management skills required of high-quality clinical studies. The co-mentors will provide integrated training
in single-cell epigenomic and transcriptomic lab techniques, data analyses, and coordinated training with four
advisory committee experts. The second key objective of this proposal is the implementation of hypothesis-
driven research aims around subtypes of immune cells that have pro-inflammatory vs. anti-inflammatory
function. Single-cell sequencing will overcome the limitations of bulk epigenetic and RNA studies and improve
attribution of gene regulation in individual cell types. We leverage the recruitment platform from our KL2 parent
study to recruit youth and examine single-cell chromatin accessibility associated with T2D. In this cross
sectional study, we will collect new peripheral blood samples from two groups of youth aged 10-20-years: new-
onset T2D case participants (n=96,000 cells from 24 participants) and healthy, normoglycemia control
participants (n=96,000 cells from 24 participants), obtained during a single study visit by oral glucose tolerance
test. Our specific aims include (a) testing the hypothesis that T helper (Th)-17 cells will be more abundant in
T2D compared to healthy control participants and regulatory T cells (Treg) more abundant in control
participants, (b) testing the hypothesis that genes determining T Helper cell type, Rorc and Foxp3, will have
different levels of chromatin accessibility and different gene expression in clinical groups, and (c) machine
learning based on high-throughput single-cell epigenomic, transcriptomic, sociodemographic, and clinical data
to classify phenotypes of T2D. In summary, this proposal assembles a team of mentors and advisors across
scientific disciplines to provide thorough training in research related to single-cell epigenetics, gene expression,
bioinformatics, machine learning, and leadership in clinical studies, with emphasis on the development of
future research for NIH grant support. The innovations of the proposed analyses, namely the integration of
single cell epigenetic and single cell gene expression, will enable construction of gene regulatory networks that
may inform new strategies to protect youth from T2D and related complications."

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the most common age-dependent movement disorder; however, it remains
mysterious how aging predisposes the brain to PD. As the body ages, senescent cells become accumulated in
multiple organs, including the brain. Recent evidence showed that removal of senescent glial cells, including
microglia, alleviates disease phenotypes in animal models of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and PD. Microglia are
brain-specific macrophages that continuously survey the brain to maintain brain homeostasis. Senescent
microglia may lose their neuroprotective functions and secret senescence-associated secretory phenotype
(SASP), leading to chronic inflammation. Therefore, there is a critical need to examine the impact of senescent
microglia on human PD. Our preliminary data with single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) technology
revealed that a subset of microglia expresses more senescence-related genes in human PD brain. The long-
term objectives of this research are to elucidate whether and how microglia become senescent in PD and to
characterize the molecular signature of senescent microglia for finding out therapeutic targets. In Aim1, we will
determine whether senescent microglia become accumulated in PD and establish the relationship between
autophagic flux and microglial senescence using human PD postmortem brain. Autophagy is a cellular
degradation pathway responsible for removing damaged cellular organelles, protein aggregates, and invading
foreign substances. Autophagy plays a role in extending healthy lifespan and preventing cellular senescence in
animal models. Our preliminary data highlights that autophagy prevents microglial senescence in mouse. In
Aim2, we will characterize the transcriptomic and proteomic signatures of senescent microglia in human PD
postmortem brain by employing snRNA-seq and spatial omics technologies. In Aim 3, we will utilize human
microglia from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) to study the roles of autophagy in microglial senescence.
We will apply RNA-seq and LC-MS/MS to elucidate the transcriptomic profile and SASP of senescent microglia,
respectively. Lastly, we will determine the effect of SASP from senescent microglia on the survival of human
dopaminergic neurons. Successful completion of this project will 1) provide evidence for microglial senescence
in human PD brain, 2) characterize the molecular signature of senescent microglia, and 3) provide insight into

Chronic Non-communicable Diseases and Disorders (NCDs) are the leading cause of global mortality,
accounting for 71% of all deaths. It is projected that by 2030, deaths from NCDs in Africa will exceed
deaths due to communicable, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional diseases combined.
Sub-Saharan Africa
is home to 90% of the
300,000 children born worldwide with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) annually and SCD
in
Sickle Cell Anemia SSA is associated with 16% of childhood mortality
. SCD is both an NCD and a
recognized as a significant cause of NCD-related morbidity and mortality in persons with (SSA). SCD
related NCDs have been observed in the brain, kidneys, heart, and lungs. The overall objective of the work
that is proposed in this application is to enhance the SCD associated NCD research capacity in Uganda.
This has been informed by the following observations: (a) SCD is very common, affecting over 350,000
people in Uganda, and accounts for 18% of all childhood morbidity
. SCD is also associated with reduced
life expectancy and poor health related quality of life for survivors. (b) Previous studies on children and
adults with SCD in Uganda have highlighted a high prevalence of stroke (6.8%), neurocognitive impairment
(21.5%), acute chest syndrome (22.7%), micro-albuminuria, and acute kidney injury. The team will work to
achieve the overall objective through the following aims: Aim 1: To train a multi-disciplinary team of
research scientists. Aim 2: To increase SCD and associated NCD research capacity across the lifespan.
Aim 3: To strengthen local and regional partnerships for advancing SCD and associated NCD research
training and advocacy. The activities in this application innovatively exploit the access to large numbers of
SCD patients and the multi-disciplinary/inter professional education expertise at Makerere University
College of Health Sciences and Busitema University, both in Uganda to increase the local SCD associated
NCD research capacity. It is anticipated that by the end of the 5-years support, a critical mass of local
research scientists will have been created to support the further growth of a high quality SCD associated
NCDs research and clinical care portfolio, focused on low-cost sustainable interventions for SCD affected
populations in Uganda and other settings including the USA.

 The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus continues to rise worldwide and despite different treatment
options, many patients fail to achieve glycemic target, which leads to increased morbidity and mortality.
Chronic exposure to hyperglycemia has been shown in both animal and human studies to decrease glucose
transport into the brain, presumably through down-regulation of GLUT1 at the blood brain barrier, which has
been postulated to be a protective adaptation of the central nervous system against the harmful consequences
of hyperglycemia. However, GLUT1 down regulation may lead to reduced brain glucose metabolism leading to
neuronal damage, neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Whether these changes in cerebral glucose
transport seen in patients with poorly controlled diabetes can be reversed is unknown. The main goal of this
study is to determine whether improvement of glucose control in poorly controlled T2DM patient will restore
brain glucose transport kinetics and rigorously assess which factors (i.e. duration DM and glycemic control)
contribute to the observed improvements by using classic metabolic studies as well as state-of-the-art brain
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) techniques. The findings obtained from this study will help
elucidate if intensive diabetes therapy may be associated with reduced brain dysfunction from hyperglycemia."
10830460,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) represent a leading health issue that causes an enormous number of deaths and
disabilities globally, highlighting the critical medical need for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
The Gao Lab recently showed that hepatocyte-specific Aldh2-deficient mice (Aldh2hep-/-) were resistant to alcohol-
seeking behavior with elevated blood acetaldehyde levels. Interestingly, Aldh2hep-/- mice also had much less
reduced energy expenditure and motility than the global Aldh2 knockout mice. These data highlight that liver-
specific inhibition of ALDH2 represents a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of AUDs with fewer
unwanted side effects. In addition, the hepatocyte-specific organic anion transporting polypeptide 1 (OATP1)
transporters (eg, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3) represent a major class of uptake transporters for liver-targeted drug
development. Our preliminary studies have shown that small-molecule YA7068 inhibits the enzymatic activity of
ALDH2 with an excellent potency (IC50 = 62 nM). Simultaneously, YA7068 functions as a substrate for OATP1B1,
leading to liver-specific targeting of ALDH2. Our hypothesis is that liver-specific inhibition of acetaldehyde
metabolism by targeting the enzymatic activity of ALDH2 is a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of
AUDs. Our goal is to synthesize a series of YA7068 analogs and test them using established assays in vitro and
in vivo, to validate and characterize potent and liver specific ALDH2 inhibitors in treating AUDs. To achieve our
goal, we will synthesize new YA7068 analogs that have been designed using a novel computer-aided drug
design (CADD) methodology SILCS (Aim 1). The synthesized compounds will be subjected to a high-throughput
ALDH2 enzymatic assay to determine their potencies for ALDH2. Selected inhibitors will be further assessed for
their specificity for ALDH2 against other related ALDH isozymes. The liver-specific uptake of new compounds
by OATP1 transporters will be quantified by comparing intracellular inhibitor levels with or without the expression
of the OATP1 transporters on the cell surface. The intracellular concentration of testing compounds will be
followed by LC-MS. The cellular toxicity of compounds will be tested using primary human hepatocytes. In Aim
2, we will determine the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of the top compound selected from Aim 1. For the top
compound, in vivo efficacy will subsequently be tested in AUD mouse models (see letter from Dr. Bin Gao). Our
collaborative research team has a strong track record of performing CADD, lead optimization, and in vitro and in
vivo evaluation of compounds. Collectively, our approach puts us in a unique position to identify, validate, and
characterize first-in-class liver-specific inhibitors of ALDH2, and to determine whether this novel mechanism of
action is a viable option for the development of a treatment for AUDs."
10817095,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The increased use of both prescription and illicit opioids among women of child-bearing age over the past two
decades has resulted in a five-fold increase in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS). The requisite
monitoring and management of infants with NOWS prolong postnatal hospitalization, resulting nationally in
hospital costs that currently exceed $560 million annually. Multiple approaches have been investigated to reduce
the substantial care and cost burden of treating infants with NOWS postnatally, including through dyadic
approaches such as the Eat, Sleep, Console protocol. Far less attention has been paid to understanding the
clinical needs and subsequent trajectory of care for infants with NOWS during the remainder of their infancy—
including their risk of hospital readmission and the associated costs. A clearer understanding of these issues is
integral to developing protocols to assist mothers with opioid use disorder (OUD) in caring for their infants during
a time when the health care needs of both the mother and the child are great. Mothers with OUD are at high risk
of relapse and of overdose during the first postpartum year. In turn, the risk of abuse or neglect is highest for all
children in the first year of life. Thus, the objective of this career development proposal is to understand the
challenges of caring for infants with NOWS in the year following discharge from the birth hospitalization. The first
study aims to quantify the risks and costs of hospital readmissions during the first year of life for infants with
NOWS. The second study will focus on the challenges of keeping infants with NOWS healthy and safe in the
year following discharge from the birth hospitalization, a vulnerable time for both mother and child.
 Long-term, my goal is to use these findings to inform the development of an evidence-based model of care
within the home-visiting framework that addresses the unique needs of families affected by NOWS following
discharge from the birth hospitalization. In applying for this award, I am seeking to develop the skills I need to
successfully transition into the field of NOWS research. As an epidemiologist with a background in pediatric
nursing, I have spent the past 12 years investigating the impact of the opioid crisis on adults (and to a lesser
extent, children and adolescents) through secondary analyses of large datasets. I need further training related
to 1) the clinical care of infants with NOWS and skillfully working with mothers with OUD, 2) economic
evaluations, 3) qualitative research methods, and 4) implementation science. I have assembled a mentorship
team led by experts in parental substance use and child abuse that addresses each area of training and
leverages the resources available at Yale. The training and research outlined in this proposal promise to have a
high impact on my career, as they will provide me with the skills and knowledge that I need to meet my long-
term career goal of developing expertise in designing substance use interventions that are evidence-based, cost-
effective, and informed by the lived experience of families."
10881901,"Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) serotype O157:H7 is a foodborne diarrheal illness typically transmitted by
contaminated beef or produce, resulting in bloody diarrhea. EHEC produce Shiga toxin (Stx), a protein
synthesis inhibitor that when absorbed from the intestine into the bloodstream, can lead to the devastating
illness, hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). HUS is characterized by fibrin-platelet thrombi in the
microvasculature and inflammatory damage of affected organs such as the kidney, resulting in renal failure.
Systemic exposure to LPS or other PAMPs during the diarrheal phase of infection can potentiate Stx’s
deleterious effects and is thought to be important in pathogenesis. EHEC are not invasive, so Stx must
traverse the intestinal epithelium to enter the systemic circulation. However, free Stx is not commonly found in
patients with HUS, and we lack an understanding of how and in what form Stx enters the blood and eventually
reaches the kidney. One potential under-explored mechanism is via uptake in the form of Stx-containing outer
membrane vesicles (OMV’s), EHEC-derived microparticles that can be absorbed from the intestinal lumen into
the bloodstream and contain, in addition to Stx, a plethora of PAMPs such as LPS and flagellae, as well as
other EHEC-encoded toxins. In this proposal, we will assess how outer membrane vesicles (OMV’s) interact
with cells of renal origin in the presence of absence of macrophages, inflammatory cells that infiltrate the
kidney in animal models of HUS. Because OMV’s are endocytosed, LPS sensing occurs intracellularly rather
than via TLR4, thus we expect to observe responses that are fundamentally different from those occurring
when Stx and LPS are co-delivered exogenously. The ability to generate OMV from EHEC mutants with
altered LPS (or other PAMPs or toxins) provide the opportunity to identify key features leading to damaging
cellular responses. In addition, it has been hypothesized that a key event in HUS pathogenesis occurs when
Stx engages circulating blood cells, resulting in the formation of Stx-containing, prothrombotic microvesicles
that then intoxicate distal organs. During EHEC infection, blood components may encounter Stx, LPS, and
other potentially damaging bacterially derived virulence factors in the context of OMV’s, but little is known
about OMV-mediated microvesicle production. We will compare the quantity of microvesicles produced upon
exposure of blood cells to purified Stx or Stx-containing OMVs from wild type EHEC or EHEC deficient in
PAMPs or virulence factors. OMV-associated cargoes, particularly the prothrombotic/pro-coagulant molecules
will be characterized, and for their effect on the renal cells described above. These in vitro studies lay the
critical groundwork for future in vivo studies in an animal model of EHEC infection. A fundamental
understanding of how and in what form Stx is encountered by the host, as well as how cellular responses are
influenced by the mode of Stx delivery, may inform new therapeutic modalities to prevent HUS."

There is an urgent need to develop novel pharmacological treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD). Recently,
psychedelic compounds have attracted great attention in treatment of different psychiatric disorders following
their reported fast-acting and long-lasting effects. Preliminary evidence from observational studies, supported
by animal studies, is promising for the potential therapeutic effects of psychedelic N,N-dimethyltryptamine
(DMT) for AUD. Here, we propose to investigate the therapeutic potential of a single dose of intravenous DMT
plus a brief course of psychotherapy (including Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET)) on alcohol
consumption in non-treatment seeking individuals with AUD, in a proof-of-concept, randomized (1:1), placebo-
controlled, double-blind, parallel group, laboratory study and clinical trial.
Methods: Otherwise healthy individuals with diagnosis of moderate to severe AUD (based on DSM5) will be
randomized to receive a single dose of intravenous DMT or active placebo (diphenhydramine). Vitals will be
closely monitored, tolerability will be measured using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and DMT acute
psychedelic effects will be assessed using the Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ), at the end of the
dosing day. Adverse events will be assessed using the Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent
Effects (SAFTEE) interview on the dosing day and weekly follow up sessions (4 weeks). One day following
drug administration, participants will attend an experimental session using Alcohol Drinking Paradigm (ADP).
All participants will consume a priming dose of alcohol at the beginning of the experimental session, which will
be followed by two 1-hour self-administration drinking sessions, over which participants will have a choice of
consuming a total of 8 drinks or receiving $5 for each drink that is not consumed. The total number of
consumed drinks is the main primary outcome. All participants will receive a brief course of psychotherapy
(including MET). We will explore the effects of DMT (plus brief psychotherapy) on participants' natural alcohol
consumption weekly for 4 weeks, using Timeline follow-back (TLFB), to measure the percentage of heavy
drinking days, abstinent days, and total amount of alcohol consumption and categorical outcomes of
abstinence, no heavy drinking and a 2-level reduction in WHO drinking risk will be compared.
Hypotheses: Relative to control (diphenhydramine, IV, 25 mg plus MET), a single psychedelic dose of
intravenous (IV) DMT (0.3 mg/kg) plus brief psychotherapy (including MET) in individuals with AUD will 1) be
safe and well-tolerated, 2) reduce alcohol consumption measured in the laboratory using Alcohol Drinking
Paradigm, the day after, and 3) reduce alcohol drinking over the following 4 weeks."

The lack of regular physical activity (PA) in over 290,000 individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) in the United
States (US) is an ongoing health crisis. This lack of activity has potentially devastating consequences because
low levels of PA in people with SCI elevates the risk of mortality due to cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and
lung disease. Furthermore, low levels of PA in individuals with SCI have been associated with secondary
conditions such as pain, fatigue, weight gain, and deconditioning. Regular PA and exercise-based
interventions have been linked with improved outcomes and healthier lifestyles among those with SCI. Sensor-
based activity monitors can assess PA and exercise interventions by quantifying wheelchair movement,
movement of the individual, and physiological changes. However, these monitors do not provide real-time,
tailored feedback and recommendations that might help individuals with SCI increase their PA levels in the
community. The overarching goal of this proposal is to evaluate a sensor-enabled, just-in-time adaptive
intervention (JITAI) strategy to increase and sustain PA levels among individuals with SCI in their communities.
The long-term goal of this research is to effectively integrate a mobile health JITAI with existing PA intervention
programs to motivate health-related behavior change in individuals with SCI. A primary objective of this
proposal is to extend our pilot work to evaluate the integration of a JITAI with a web-based 14-week PA
intervention program from the National Center on Health, Physical Activity and Disability (Aim 1). We
hypothesize that the integration of web-based PA intervention program with JITAI will result in significantly
higher PA levels over 14 weeks compared to the standard we-based PA intervention program alone. A
secondary objective of this study is to extend existing algorithms that use commercial wearable technology to
robustly detect PA behaviors to facilitate the delivery of tailored just-in-time actionable feedback and PA
recommendations for individuals with SCI (Aims 3 and 4).
The integration of the JITAI, which provides feedback and PA recommendations due to sensor-based
assessments of PA, with the standard web-based PA intervention program will be tested via a clinical trial that
combines a randomized controlled trial and a micro-randomized trial. Our team includes investigators with
expertise in SCI research, mobile health, PA tracking, and behavioral change interventions. The proposed
study will yield novel insights about JITAIs and JITAIs combined with more traditional, web-based PA
intervention programs, which will help researchers design engaging PA interventions for individuals with
disability in the community that may improve their health and quality of life."

Individual and household debt plays an increasingly important role in the dynamics of inequality in the
United States. However, current data limitations impede scientific understanding of the role of
indebtedness in reducing or exacerbating economic insecurity. At best, existing social surveys collect
data on a subset of mainstream debts most often encountered by middle-class populations
(mortgages, credit cards, auto loans, student loans), while debts common to low-income populations
(payday loans, legal debts, past due bills, child support arrears, loans from employers, family, and
friends) are less well represented. Without better data, scientific analyses of population health and
wellbeing may understate and misidentify crucial sources of economic insecurity and disadvantage,
as well as reciprocal effects of debt with poverty, health, and family functioning. This project consists
of a multi-pronged data collection and analysis effort to build a stronger data infrastructure, more
adequate and accurate measures of indebtedness, and best practices for analyzing various forms of
indebtedness and their relation to economic hardship and financial strain for low-income families. The
project has three Specific Aims: (1) To conduct qualitative cognitive and developmental interviews
with low-income families on their experiences with debt and use these results to develop an
enhanced survey instrument that comprehensively and accurately captures low-income debt holding;
(2) To field a two-wave pilot study designed to allow comparison of data quality and accuracy when
collected via the enhanced instrument versus current ‘gold standard’ instruments (instruments will be
randomly assigned); and (3) To analyze linked pilot survey, high-quality administrative (employment,
earnings, and benefit receipt), and individual credit report data to (a) document consistency of self-
reported debt data collected via each instrument with credit report data; (b) examine whether
consistency and differences by data collection instrument differ by respondent financial literacy and
sociodemographic characteristics (education, race); (c) estimate associations of types and amounts
of debt using the enhanced module, existing modules, and credit report data with economic hardship
and financial strain; and (d) investigate the causal order of associations of (the three measures of)
debt with economic hardship and financial strain. The study will be the first to provide detailed data on
the full range of types and amounts of indebtedness among low-income populations and their
associations with hardship and financial strain. By improving data collection and analysis, the study
had the potential to identify policy levers that could reduce potential negative effects of debt on
disadvantaged families and better target interventions to lessen economic insecurity and improve
well-being."
11177103,"No vaccines or treatments for SARS-CoV-2 are yet available. A simple prophylactic antiviral strategy would
protect naïve individuals from infection now. In the future, when vaccines should be available, a prophylactic
antiviral will be essential for individuals who do not mount a suitable immune response. Antivirals that target
viral entry into the host cell have been proven effective against a wide range of viral diseases. The entry/fusion
process for CoV (including SARS-CoV-2) is mediated by the viral envelope glycoprotein (S). Concerted action
by the receptor-binding domain and the fusion domain is required for fusion. Upon viral attachment (and uptake
in certain cases), large-scale conformational rearrangements occur in the fusion domain, driven by formation of
a structure that couples protein refolding directly to membrane fusion. The formation of this structure can be
targeted by fusion inhibitory peptides (C-terminal heptad repeat or HRC peptides) that prevent proper
apposition of the HRC and HRN domains in S. We have found that conjugation of a lipid to an inhibitory
peptide directs the peptide to cell membranes and increases antiviral efficacy. Analogous lipo-peptides prevent
infection by several viruses (measles, Nipah, parainfluenza, influenza), and can be administered via the
airway. Treatment is effective for some of these even several days after infection. In addition, we have shown
that modifying the backbone of an HRC peptide via periodic replacement of α-amino acid residues with β-
amino acid residues generates α/β-peptides that retain antiviral potency (toward HIV or parainfluenza) but are
highly resistant to proteolysis. We recently generated an HRC lipopeptide that is effective against both SARS-
CoV2 and MERS live viruses in vitro, blocks spread of SARS-CoV2 in human airway tissue, and inhibits
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between ferrets in direct contact. Here we propose to combine the lipid
conjugation and backbone-modification strategies to generate potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV2 infection that
display a long half-life in vivo.
1. Optimize the antiviral potency and bioavailability of SARS-CoV-2 HRC peptide fusion inhibitors via
rational molecular engineering. Antiviral efficacy of α/β-lipopeptide candidates will be measured in
quantitative in vitro assays, in authentic virus infection, and in a human airway model.
2. Evaluate the protection afforded by new backbone-modified α/β-lipopeptide fusion inhibitors against
SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters. Analysis of in vivo biodistribution and toxicity of backbone modified S-
CoV-2 α/β-lipopeptide fusion inhibitors and assessment of in vivo potency and resistance mechanisms will lay
the foundation for a safe and effective SARS CoV-2 fusion inhibitor for coronavirus prevention and
therapy."

Hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA) occurs during reproductive years and results in ovulatory dysfunction,
anovulation and infertility which can be prolonged from months to years. There are multiple HA phenotypes
including varying combinations of psychosocial stress, anxiety, high levels of physical activity and/or weight loss.
Large population studies, including the original Nurses’ Health Study have related menstrual cycle
irregularity/amenorrhea with cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. However, these analyses have not
differentiated the HA phenotype from polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and other lower prevalence menstrual
disorders. Emerging data from our group indicates that one-third of women with HA (mean age 27 yrs) have
preclinical CVD measured noninvasively as vascular dysfunction, and circulating cytokine patterns indicative of
vascular inflammation compared to age-matched eumenorrheic controls not on hormone therapy.
Our proposed research application responds to the funding opportunity announcement PA-20-281, “Fertility
Status as a Marker for Overall Health” and will study HA, a marker of fertility status, related to cardiovascular
health. In Aim 1, we will use innovative remote patient monitoring and patient reported outcomes to investigate
HA specific phenotype(s) related to preclinical CVD (Aim 1a) and vascular inflammation (Aim 1b). We will then
expand our analysis in Aim 2 to the Nurses’ Health Study II, a large prospective cohort study that can now
phenotype women with HA in the premenopausal years and determine associations with subsequent 30 year
incident CVD risk factors and clinical CVD events. Understanding the HA phenotype(s) related to CVD is a crucial
next step to identify women at-risk in order to take preventive action and improve overall CVD health. Early
identification of young at-risk women presents a unique opportunity to intervene earlier in life when CVD
preventive approaches are most beneficial. Further, preclinical CVD is a multi-organ disease that left untreated
can manifest in neurocognitive disorders, peripheral CVD, and chronic kidney disease that contribute to health
disparities in women. The outcome of the proposed research will identify young women at risk of CVD using HA
phenotyping to inform the design of next step intervention trials and, ultimately, to translate our findings to clinical
care to address the CVD epidemic in younger women using existing and emerging cardiovascular preventive
strategies."

This is a revised competing renewal to continue work in our birth cohort of mother-infant Hispanic dyads. Through
repeated sampling and analysis of breastmilk, along with detailed and repeated infant assessments from birth to
2y of age, we have made significant contributions to the field of maternal-infant nutrition. This work extended our
knowledge on the role of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), and their dynamic changes during the course of
breastfeeding, on infant growth, obesity, eating behaviors, and cognitive development. Based on novel findings,
we propose a series of new rigorous assessments at age 5y, with a focus on examining the role of HMOs on
adiposity (abdominal MRI), appetite regulation (eating in the absence of hunger), brain structure and function
(multimodal MRI), and cognitive outcomes (NIH toolbox). Aim 1 will examine the impact of infant exposure to
HMOs during breastfeeding on obesity and appetite regulation, with a focus on 5 HMO’s that have demonstrated
significant associations in prior/ongoing studies. We hypothesize that these HMOs will be associated with
reduced adiposity (subcutaneous, visceral, and liver fat), and this will be mediated by reduced eating in the
absence of hunger. Aim 2 will examine the impact of infant exposure to HMOs that provide a source of fucose
and sialic acid that are important for brain development. We will use multimodal MRI for assessment of brain
structure (anatomical MRI), function (resting state fMRI), blood flow (arterial spin labeling), and myelination and
tissue microstructure (diffusion tensor imaging) as well as cognitive outcomes. Based on preliminary data, we
hypothesize that 2’FL during the first month of breastfeeding, and continued exposure to 3FL and 3’SL (the only
HMOs which we have found to increase during breastfeeding), will be associated with improved brain outcomes.
This will include: a) thicker cortical mantle and reduced fractional anisotropy within cortical gray matter
(representing greater dendritic arborization); b) reduced resting perfusion of cortical gray matter (representing
greater neuronal metabolic efficiency); c) reduced diffusivity in white matter tracts (representing more
myelination); d) stronger measures of resting functional connectivity (representing more efficient information
transfer), and e) enhanced cognitive outcomes. Aim 3 will examine the impact of breast feeding on eating in the
absence of hunger and structural and functional differences in key areas of the brain involved with appetite
regulation. We hypothesize that longer-term duration breastfeeding, and therefore greater exposure to 3FL and
3’SL, will be associated with reduced eating in the absence of hunger, and this will be mediated by a thicker
cortical mantle and reduced fractional anistrophy in brain regions associated with appetite regulation. This study
will move the field forward by identifying how early-life dietary exposures (breastfeeding, HMOs and HMO
changes during the course of breastfeeding) affect obesity, appetite regulation, brain structure and function and
cognitive outcomes during early childhood development."
10909031,"Longitudinal Mapping of Human Brain Development in the First Years of Life
Abstract
This proposal requests continued funding support for research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
to develop computational tools for quantifying longitudinal structural changes in the human brain. The previous
project period has been extremely successful in advancing robust tools for longitudinal brain analysis of the aging
brain. In this renewal, we seek to further advance robust computational tools for comprehensive longitudinal
characterization of changes in the early developing brain. This is in line with our long-term goal of creating
computational tools for longitudinal charting of brain evolution across the entire human lifespan. The tools to be
developed in this project will allow uniﬁed and concurrent analysis of longitudinal volumetric data and cortical
surfaces, facilitating the mapping of dynamic and spatially heterogeneous structural changes during a critical
period of brain development.
The tools developed in this project will be tailored to studying the human brain in the ﬁrst few years of life, which
undergoes dynamic development in both structure and function. We will utilize the MRI data made available via
the Baby Connectome Project (BCP), involving 500 pediatric subjects scanned from birth to ﬁve years of age. The
outcome of BCP will inform neuroscientists what normal healthy growth looks like and facilitate discovery of the
earliest manifestations of brain disorders. To fully beneﬁt from this unique dataset, dedicated computational tools
are needed for accurate processing and analysis of baby MR images, which typically exhibit dynamic heteroge-
neous changes across time. However, most computational tools developed to date have been mostly focused on
adult subjects and are unreliable when applied to baby MRI. We propose to address this gap with three aims:
In Aim 1, we will develop computational tools to allow multifaceted analysis of MRI data, including volumes and
white-matter/pial surfaces, to be carried out in common spaces for a more holistic understanding of the early
developing brain. Our tools will explicitly consider the rapid changes in MR image appearances that are typical in
the ﬁrst year of life. Unlike conventional methods that are designed for either image volumes or cortical surfaces,
resulting in inconsistencies and loss of sensitivity to subtle changes, our tools will allow joint volume-surface
analysis in consistent longitudinal spaces. Improving registration accuracy by drawing information from both
entities is critical for detecting subtle changes in the developing brain, which is signiﬁcantly smaller with a thinner
cerebral cortex.
In Aim 2, we will generate longitudinal, multimodal, and whole-brain parcellation maps for the early developing
brain. Subdivision of the brain into coherent regions is an essential step in the macroscopic mapping of spa-
tially heterogeneous changes and in the examination of spatial and topological organization. Our approach will
allow the characterization of the evolution of parcellation across time and at the same time maintain temporal
consistency and inter-subject correspondences of the parcels.
In Aim 3, we will develop techniques that will allow prediction of missing MRI data to increase the usability of
incomplete data for improving statistical power. Missing data is a common and inevitable problem in longitudinal
studies due to subject dropouts or failed scans, especially in studies involving infants. To address this problem,
we will develop deep learning techniques for longitudinal prediction of missing imaging data.
Successful completion of this project will empower the neuroscience community with computational tools for more
precise charting of the normative early development of the human brain using MRI. As part of this project, we will
deliver the ﬁrst set of temporally-dense surface-volumetric atlases that will capture key developmental traits
and are therefore critical for quantiﬁcation of possible deviation from normal brain development."
